Rodrigo Anes de S√° Almeida e Meneses, 1st Marquis of Abrantes (19 October 1676 ‚Äì 30 April 1733), before 1718 titled 3rd Marquis of Fontes and 7th Count of Penagui√£o, was a Portuguese nobleman and diplomat. The Marquis of Abrantes enjoyed a significant international projection in the first half of the 18th century, first in the service of King Peter II but mainly in that of his son and sucessor King John V. While acting as the king's representative in the Papal Court, and afterwards in the Spanish Court, he was a major player in two significant events in the history of Portuguese diplomacy: the Embassy to Pope Clement XI in 1716, and the Exchange of the Princesses in 1729.  Early life  D. Rodrigo was the third-born and youngest son of D. Francisco de S√° e Meneses, 1st Marquis of Fontes and 4th Count of Penagui√£o (c.1640‚Äì1677) and his wife D. Joana Lu√≠sa de Lancastre. He was baptised by his uncle D. Lu√≠s de Sousa, Cardinal-Archbishop of Lisbon. After his father's death in 1677, the Dowager Marchioness took up the responsibility of overseeing the education of her children: she envisioned a career in Letters for D. Rodrigo, accordingly, she assigned to him the distinguished Latinist scholar In√°cio da Silva as a teacher. The Dowager Marchioness's plans changed drastically after her two eldest sons died; at age 12, in 1688, D. Rodrigo succeeded his brother as head of the illustrious and powerful House of Penagui√£o of his forebears. In 1690, D. Joana had him married to the daughter of the Duke of Cadaval, D. Isabel Henriqueta de Lorena, who had originally been promised to D. Rodrigo's brother; four children were born of this union: D. Ana Maria Catarina Henrique de Lorena (1691‚Äì1761), D. Joaquim Francisco de S√° Almeida e Meneses, 2nd Marquis of Abrantes (1695‚Äì1756), D. Maria Sofia de Lancastre (1696‚Äì1758), and D. Lu√≠sa Maria de Faro (1697‚Äì1697). The marriage was cut short by D. Isabel's illness and death on 26 November 1699. After his widowerhood, the Marquis of Fontes became more directly involved in the service of the King. During the War of the Spanish Succession, as Peter II of Portugal allied himself with the English and the Germans to prevent a dynastic union between France and Spain under Philip, Duke of Anjou, the Marquis of Fontes served as mestre de camp of the Old Tercio of Set√∫bal from 1703 to 1706. While in command of this infantry unit, the Marquis had them in new military uniforms at his own expense, generously fed his men, and opted to lodge himself in monasteries to which he would then leave substantial tithes.  Embassy to Pope Clement XI  The Marquis of Fontes was selected to carry out the important task of ambassador extraordinary of John V of Portugal to the Holy See, as befitting his long familial tradition of diplomatic service. This was an exceptionally important mission, since the reign of John V was characterised by sustained cultural activity, generally seen as the apex of Absolutism and Baroque culture in the Portuguese Empire, promoting the image of the monarch as a protector of the arts and sciences, while at the same time presenting the country's imperial ideal. The Marquis of Fontes left for Genoa on 9 January 1712, aboard the carrack La Madonna delle Vigne, commanded by Giovanni Lorenzo Viviani, accompanied by his family and proteg√©s such as the young painter Vieira Lusitano. After a turbulent and stormy voyage (especially while crossing the Gulf of Lion, which motivated a landing in Cagliari in Sardinia, from where passengers and crew made a brief barefoot procession to the Shrine of Our Lady of Fair Winds where the Marquis left a gold ingot worth 500 thousand r√©is as votive offering), they reached their destination on 30 March. They stayed in Genoa for over a month and a half, and embarked to Livorno on 17 May, where they arrived the following day. Travelling the rest of the route by land, they arrived in Rome on 21 May 1712, in time to attend, the following day, the Canonisation Mass of Saints Catherine of Bologna, Pope Pius V, Andrew Avellino, and Felix of Cantalice. The Marquis first stayed with the Portuguese envoy in Rome, Andr√© de Melo e Castro, but afterwards rented a house in Piazza Colonna. Even though the ambassador was in Rome, his solemn public entry was delayed for four years due to a long waiting list for such public entries in Rome; the Marquis of Fontes made use of this setback to carefully prepare the lavish ceremony. During this time, he cultivated an important friendship with Cardinal Annibale Albani, nephew of Pope Clement XI, who received from the Marquis a lavish gift of precious objects from Brazil and India, as well as a set of Chinese and Japanese porcelain, symbolic of the span and importance of the Portuguese Empire. The Marquis of Fontes made his public entrance in Rome on 8 July 1716, on a parade of an unusually splendid scale. The rules of protocol were scrupulously observed and the total number of carriages employed for the procession led by the ambassador comprised five state coaches (three of which survive in the collections of the National Coach Museum, in Lisbon), and 10 other processional vehicles ‚Äî thus exceeding the requisite 12 officially stipulated. The richly decorated carriages were complete with monumental gilded sculptures that in effect sought to celebrate the Portuguese overseas victories in battle as a means of spreading the Roman Catholic faith to pagan nations, to demonstrate the riches enjoyed by Portugal, and, most importantly, to affirm before the Pope and the foreign ambassadors at the Papal Court that Portugal was already an old imperial power whose possessions dated from before the emergence of other European colonial powers. By celebrating the Portuguese feats in the Indian Ocean with such great splendour, at a time when the main European powers ‚Äî Great Britain, France, The Netherlands ‚Äî were competing for India, the Embassy of the Marquis of Fontes was successful effort to contradict the perception that most Europeans had of the decline of the Portuguese possessions in India and present Portugal as a strong imperial power. There is suggestive evidence that the Marquis of Fontes himself took a direct personal interest in the decorative programme of the processional carriages. After the parade, the Marquis of Fontes received \\"great demonstrations of benevolence and joy\\" from Pope Clement XI before kneeling to kiss his slippers. The ambassador then formally presented his letter of credence, relayed the Pope news of the birth of a new Infante of Portugal (Carlos of Braganza), and gave a full account of \\"the powerful rescue that [King John] was sending to defend Italy, formidably threatened by the Ottoman might\\". The Embassy of the Marquis of Fontes was a resounding success. Having impressed the papal court, Pope Clement XI raised the dignity of the Archdiocese of Lisbon to the Patriarchate of Lisbon, making the Portuguese capital only one of two dioceses with this title in Europe, alongside Venice. King John's good fortune with the papacy and Italy would continue to raise the next year, in 1717, when the aid of a Portuguese squadron of ships helped win the Battle of Matapan, in the ongoing Ottoman-Venetian War.  Later life  Caia River on the Portugal‚ÄìSpain border Upon his return from Lisbon, by Royal Decree of 24 June 1718, D. Rodrigo Anes de S√° was made Marquis of Abrantes, and the title was conferred the additional privilege of Honours of Kin to the King (an official acknowledgement of the blood relationship between the title holder and the Crown, which conferred precedence over other Grandees). The territorial designation was chosen on account of him being a descendant, through the distaff line, of the ancient Counts of Abrantes, already extinct. From 1727 to 1729, the Marquis of Fontes also served as Ambassador Extraordinary to the Spanish Court, where he was responsible for the negotiations for the \\"Exchange of the Princesses\\", the double marriage of Spanish Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain to the heir of the Portuguese throne, Joseph, Prince of Brazil, and of her older half-brother Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias to Joseph's sister the Infanta Barbara of Portugal, in January 1729. After this, he was conferred the Order of the Golden Fleece by Philip V of Spain. He died on 30 April 1733, and was succeeded in his titles by his only son, D. Joaquim Francisco de S√° Almeida e Meneses (1695-1756). Titles and styles *19 October 1676 ‚Äì 10 March 1688: His Lordship D.

They live and work in New York City.  Early life and education  Okoyomon was born in London, England in 1993. At age eleven, they moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. Okoyomon attended the great books school Shimer college in Chicago where they studied pataphysics, or the physics of the imagination. While still in college, Okoyomon worked at the three star Michelin restaurant Alinea for two years. For their thesis presentation at school, Okoyomon hosted a series of experimental dinners that featured dishes like rock soup, and had guests dine under hanging rope nooses.  Work and career  Okoyomon's multidisciplinary practice investigates the racialization of the natural world, Christianity, intimacy, and ideas and experiences of life, death and time. Their installations, sculptures, performances, and poetry often draw from their family history as well as their encounters with queerness and the internet, and frequently return to figures like the angel, the sun, and trees as visual and conceptual motifs. Okoyomon has had institutional solo exhibitions at the MMK in Frankfurt and the LUMA Westbau in Zurich, and group exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the Kunsthal Charlottenborg, and in 2018 were included in the 13th Baltic Triennial. Okoyomon participated in Hans Ulrich Obrist's 2018 Work Marathon, and has read their poetry at The Kitchen, The Studio Museum in Harlem, MoMA PS1, Hauser and Wirth, The KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Artists Space, and The Poetry Project, performing alongside Eileen Myles, Samuel Delany, and John Giorno. In 2019, Okoyomon was nominated for the Paulo Cunha E Silva Art Prize and was included in Cultured Magazine's \\"30 under 35\\" list of notable emerging artists. = Ajebota (2016) = Taking its title from a Youraba word meaning \\"spoiled rich kid,\\" Okoyomon's first book of poetry explores the complexities of their identity as a black queer immigrant inhabiting a specific class position. The book which often makes use of internet shorthand and text abbreviation, frequently steals from the work of other poets, and ends with a poem composed of screenshots of a text conversation engages the challenges of writing and reading poetry in the digital age. The book which has been interpreted as a response to Alt Lit, cites Dana Ward, Hannah Black, Juliana Huxtable, Bhanu Kapil, Simone White, and Fred Moten among its many influences. = I NEED HELP (2018) = For Okoyomon's first art exhibition, they collaborated with Hannah Black at the New York Gallery Real Fine Arts on a sequel to Black's 2017 show \\"Some Context\\" commissioned by the Chisenhale Gallery in London, where Black filled the exhibition space with 20,000 copies of a book they produced entitled \\"The Situation\\" composed of interviews Black conducted with friends about a situation but where each explicit mention of what the situation is was redacted. In \\"I Need Help,\\" as in \\"Some Context,\\" many of the copies of the book were shredded. For Okoyomon's contribution to the show, they made a series of dolls consisting of raw wool bound by yarn. In a press release written by Okoyomon and Black, they propose that the exhibition \\"gestures towards a politics or aesthetics based on the underlying and frankly disgusting processes of rot and collapse that have produced the dirt from which everything grows. = Making Me Blush (2018) = In a two person exhibition at Quinn Harrelson / Current Projects, with the artist Puppies Puppies, Okoyomon presented their first large scale sculpture. In the piece, which re-stages the iconographic lynching trees of the American south, Okoyomon, hung a grouping of stuffed animals made to resemble angels, by the addition of taxidermied bird wings, from rope nooses attached to the limbs of a large live tree planted in a mound of soil. Conflating an esoteric Christian interpretation of an angel as a creature without life and without death, and theories of social death and slavery in the black radical tradition, Okoyomon constructed an artwork that models a complex notion of black life, by contrasting the physical impossibility of killing an angel from hanging, because the winged creature can always fly upwards to escape the pull of gravity, with the conceptual impossibility of living a life where one always has to fly just to stay alive. Okoyomon suggests that \\"black life is a mere mobilization of death.\\" In an interview with Okoyomon at the 2019 DLD Conference in Munich, Hans Ulrich Obrist called the exhibition \\"an absolute highlight of 2018.\\" Okoyomon's work from the exhibition is now included in the permanent collection of the Rubell Museum. = A Drop of Sun Under the Earth (2019) = Okoyomon's first institutional solo exhibition mounted at the LUMA Westbau in Zurich in collaboration with The The Serpentine Galleries in 2019, curated by Fredi Fischli and Niels Olsen, continued the artist's exploration of history of the intersection of race and ideas about nature, light, life and death, and architecture. The show, building upon gestures first made in Making Me Blush the previous year, presents a forest of the artist's lynching tree sculptures in the museum's Heimo Zobernig designed schwarzescaf√© space. In an installation piece entitled \\"Frenzied Sun,\\" Okoyomon created a machine that uses the gallery's air conditioning system to circulate cotton and cottonwood seeds through the space like snow. The show includes Okoyomon's first video work entitled \\"It's Disassociating Season,\\" which was projected in the space and played on loop. Running for nine and a half minutes, the single channel video follows an animated bear smoking a blunt in the woods while a recording of the artist's brother recounting the times he was almost shot during encounters with the American police plays. In the film, a sun countenanced by the cartoon face of a black child swings in and out of view. The work intends to open up a conversation about racialized understandings of evil through tragic comedy. In another architectural intervention, Okoyomon has placed spheres made of black resin and cotton over the existing lighting features in the space. The work references to the Lantern Laws, an 18th century legal code that required black, mixed race, and indigenous people to carry lanterns if they were walking about New York City after sunset without the company of a white person. The show's press release, following the scholarship of Simone Browne, argues \\"the Lantern Laws lay[ed] the foundation for modern surveillance\\" and their existence reveals the long \\"history of the criminalization...of light, darkness, and the sun (which Okoyomon believes to be indisputably black)\\" The exhibition's title is taken from a Frantz Fanon's quotation from White Skin Black Masks, where the political philosopher and clinical psychiatrist offers people are ‚Äúblack, not because of a curse, but because [their] skin has been able to capture all the cosmic effluvia...a drop of sun under the earth.‚Äù Reviewer's noted Okoyomon's exhibition's engagement with Black studies Scholar Christina Sharpe's notion that anti-blackness is the weather, forwarded in her book \\"In the Wake: On Blackness and Being.\\" = The End of The World (2019) = In Okoyomon's first play, commissioned for Serpentine Galleries's 2019 Cos X Park Night Series, curated by Claude Adjil, the artist cast four black women to play angels who have fallen to earth to initiate the reckoning. Performed in the Kensington Gardens Junya Ishigami Serpentine Architecture Pavilion, the play featured costumes made by Fabian Kis-Juhasz and a score written by Yves B. Golden. = Earthseed (2020) = Curated by Susanne Pfeffer, at the MMK in Frankfurt, Earthseed is Okoyomon's first institutional solo exhibition in Germany and their largest show to date. The exhibition's title is the name of a fictional religion in Octavia E. Butler‚Äôs books Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents, that proposes \\"the Earth‚Äôs seed can be transplanted anywhere and, through adaptation, will survive.\\" Like the imagined religion, Okoyomon's exhibition envisions a \\"theology of mutation, flux, and motion.\\"In a piece called \\"resistance is an atmospheric condition,\\" Okoyomon filled the gallery space with the Japanese vine Kudzu. Responding to the gallery building's history as a passport office, Okoyomon used the invasive plant as an artwork to comment on ideas about immigration, invasion, race, and what is allowed to be considered natural.The show's press release recounts how Kudzu was first imported to the American South in 1876 with the intention that when planted its roots would strengthen the ecosystem's soil which as result of the excessive over cultivation of cotton by chattel slaves during the period was threatened by wide spread erosion. While the vine in some respects served its intended purpose and remains even today a foundational and necessary bulwark against the dissolution of the region's soil, the speed at which the vine was able to grow, when removed from its original planting and its natural predators, allowed it to consume massive tracts of land earning it the name \\"the vine that ate the south.\\" Soon, growing or planting of Kudzu was made a criminal offense in many states. Okoyomon suggests that despite the fact that vine's \\"specific history as a failed remedy for the monumental toll slavery took on the ecological system of the American South has been largely forgotten,\\" Kudzu might serve as a metaphor for Blackness itself, which like the plant, became monstrous when removed from its home in Africa and was taken to the states, where it functioned simultaneously as \\"indispensable to and irreconcilable with Western civilization.\\" The show also includes six large scale sculptures, made out of raw wool, modeled after the dolls Okoyomon first exhibited in their first collaborative exhibition \\"I NEED HELP\\" with Hannah Black. Hannah Black wrote an essay for the exhibition's accompanying booklet. Reviewing the show for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Stefan Trinks writes that the show is one of \\"those exhibitions, that despite [its] metabolic fullness, creates clarity.\\" Trinks offers that Okoyomon's particular identity as an African immigrant to the United States might serve as a key to understanding the exhibition's complicated but perspicuous understanding of global Blackness, and the feelings of alienation and displacement that come along with navigating it. = Spiral Theory Test Kitchen (2018-ongoing) = In 2018, Okoyomon, Bobbi Salv√∂r Menuez, and Quori Theodor, formed Spiral Theory Test Kitchen. In 2019, Rachel Hahn profiled \\"self-described collaborative queer cooking collective\\" and the experimental dishes they create, for Vogue Magazine, calling their meals \\"mind-altering.\\" Other critics have noted the influence of BDSM, theories of quantum entanglement, Donna Haraway's scholarship, queer experience, language poetry, and Okoyomon's Nigerian upbringing on the group's psychosexual cuisine. In an article published by Eater, actress Indya Moore is quoted after eating a dinner made by the collective saying that ‚Äúthis is the most queer, trans, gender non-conforming food I‚Äôve ever had in my whole life,‚Äù and joking ‚Äúif you eat this food, it will deconstruct your toxic masculinity.‚Äù . For the Fashion designer Telfar's autumn/winter 2020 show at Florence‚Äôs Pitti Uomo, models were sent down a circular runway that doubled as a dining table for a meal prepared and envisioned by Spiral Theory Test Kitchen. = But Did U Die? (2020) = Okoyomon's second book \\"But Did U Die?\\" will be published by Wonder Press in 2020. In an advanced blurb for the book by Eileen Myles, they write \\"Precious is every kind of artist but [they] could only be a poet. [Their] ‚Äòalso‚Äô barges into every world, [Their] work is pure manifesto, stopping to laugh, it‚Äôs bawdy and pretty, handsome, cataclysmic and righteous. It‚Äôs food. It‚Äôs impatient and entirely on [their] own time and I think [they] touch ours, everyone else‚Äôs, in a burn the earth Jimi Hendrix way. No, [they're] post him. The earth is burnt. [They] start there.\\"  Influences and Inspirations  Okoyomon's practice has been influenced by the work of Pope L., Adrian Piper, Eileen Myles, Arthur Jafa, Pierre Huyghe, Anicka Yi, and Rirkrit Tiravanija. In an article in Artsy, Anicka Yi recognized Okoyomon as one of the female artist's who deserves the art world's attention, calling Okoyomon \\"brilliant\\" and writing that she \\"believes [Okoyomon] is expanding the boundaries of what art can be.\\" In a conversation at Art Basel Miami on Artist's influences, moderated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Okoyomon and Rirkrit Tiravanija spoke about the inspiration they have had on each others work.

It was the first new commercial television station to operate in Kansas City in nearly 15 years. It broadcast from October 29, 1969, to July 8, 1971, failing due to financial difficulties. After the station ceased broadcasting, the equipment was acquired by Community Service Broadcasting of Mid-America, which had also purchased public television station KCSD-TV (channel 19); KCIT-TV's equipment and KCSD-TV's license were used to relaunch public television in Kansas City as KCPT in 1972. The KCIT call letters are now used by the Fox affiliate in Amarillo, Texas. History On May 11, 1965, Allied Broadcasting, Inc., composed of 20 local businessmen led by James H. Ottman, filed for a construction permit to build a new television station in Kansas City, to operate on channel 25. The channel had been occupied by KCTY, a short-lived UHF outlet owned by the DuMont Television Network that lasted less than a year in 1953 and 1954. After Allied applied for a construction permit, however, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revised the UHF table of allocations twice in the span of a year. By the time Allied's application had been designated for hearing against a competing bid from Midway Broadcasting, it was for channel 36; when the FCC granted Allied the construction permit that April, it was for channel 50. The station remained unbuilt by late 1968. KCIT-TV signed on October 29, 1969. The first new station to sign on in town in a decade, channel 50 filled an immediate void. Kansas City had not had a commercial independent since KCTY's demise, and by the end of the decade, it was the only major U.S. city to lack one. The station was able to clear a significant volume of network programs that the three affiliated stations in town did not, including one night of movies from each of the networks. It was also the first locally owned Kansas City station since WDAF-TV was sold in 1958. Local programming included a children's show hosted by Torey Southwick, formerly of KMBC-TV; a young Walt Bodine served as the station's news director. As channel 50 was constructed, so too was a second UHF commercial station for Kansas City: KBMA-TV channel 41, which signed on in 1970. Prior to channel 50's going on air, the management of KBMA made two offers to KCIT stockholders to merge the two operations, one of which would have seen channel 41 donated to the University of Missouri; both were rebuffed by the stockholders. The two stations were even managed by twin brothers. With a competitor, channel 50 suffered, particularly financially, and conditions came to a head in the summer of 1971. On June 23, the station cut back its broadcast day, signing on the air at 2:30 p.m. instead of 9 a.m., and replaced its general manager; owner Ottman declared, \\"KCIT-TV is here to stay\\". At the start of July, Allied sought permission to take KCIT-TV silent and immediately cut its schedule to the minimum two hours a day while it waited for its request to be processed. At 4:30 p.m. on July 8, the FCC approved Allied's request, and channel 50 signed off the air; that day, Jackson County sheriff's deputies served a writ of replevin on $495,000 worth of equipment the station had bought from RCA. Ottman blamed the bad economy for the station's demise. Allied Broadcasting would declare bankruptcy in September. =Facility reuse= The fate of the channel 50 facility was placed into immediate question, and a suitor appeared: Community Service Broadcasting of Mid-America, Inc. (CSB), which was in the process of negotiating to buy KCSD-TV channel 19, the educational station owned by the Kansas City School District. The possibility of acquiring the KCIT physical plant would allow CSB to avoid needing to rent the facilities of KCSD-TV, which broadcast at lower power and was not equipped for color telecasting; however, the station would need to telecast educational programs on channel 19, because television sets in schools had been equipped with tuning strips that could not receive other UHF channels. At a court-ordered auction on October 29, CSB purchased the KCIT facilities, except those owned by RCA, for $156,000, beating out a rival bid from Black radio station owner Andrew Carter, who wanted to start a minority-oriented television station. Ultimately, instead of operating both stations as once proposed, CSB chose to focus on improving channel 19. CSB renamed KCSD-TV KCPT on January 1, 1972. A new channel 19 transmitter and antenna, using the tower purchased from RCA, launched October 16, 1972. =Future use of channel 50 in Kansas City= Channel 50 would remain silent in Kansas City for another seven years after KCIT-TV's closure. In 1976, Kansas City Youth for Christ, Inc., applied to build a station on channel 50. KYFC-TV began broadcasting December 15, 1978.

He is the author of the cult novel of recent Serbian prose, The Role of My Family in the World Revolution, 1969, set in war and post-war Belgrade. At the same time, ƒÜosiƒá is the legatee to the Central European prose tradition of intellectual essayism, as well as one of the last intellectuals who emotionally and sincerely identified with the Yugoslavia, with a mixture of elegiac and painful re-examination after its disintegration. A film of the same name was made based on that novel. The disintegration of Yugoslavia took the writer into voluntary exile (most often in Rovinj and Berlin, while publishing in Croatia). That part of his work is marked mainly by essays, among which the Diary of Stateless Persons, 1993, (again a play with fictitious identity through which he expresses views on contemporary socio- political reality), Good Governance, 1995, and Customs Declaration, 2000, a semi - autobiographical text soaked in reflections on Yugoslavia and the author 's mixed feelings about it.

The painting was probably completed in the 1620s and is currently housed at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Painting Glimpse of dale and mountains in the distance The painting shows the typical fantastic landscape painted by de Momper. Momper was part of an imaginary trend carried on by Flemish artists who painted exotic and mountainous views in an imaginative and apparently old fashioned style, which was less realistic than that of many other 17th-century painters. Paintings of this kind were not executed in this fashion due to a lack of skills or understanding of unified space, light effects or low horizon; rather, they were produced thusly to suit the more experienced and sophisticated tastes of collectors who \\"valued the inventiveness and refinement of the 'imaginary' landscapes.\\" This kind of paintings generally cost much more. The Gro√üe Gebirgslandschaft is closed to the right by a wooded cliff, from around which the viewer is given a glimpse of a dale, which recedes into a distant massif. A trail winds down into the valley from the foreground. Several people are travelling up and down the path. In the foreground, a group of travelers including a horseman and a dog are marching up the mountain trail. The latter figures have been attributed to Hans III Jordaens, who reportedly painted the staffage for this painting. Provenance of the painting The painting was part of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria collection. Leopold was regent of the Netherlands from 1647 to 1656. Thanks to the 1648 Civil War in England and the several art collections that came into the market because of that, he was able to acquire a large number of valuable paintings in that period. He purchased masterpieces of both Early Netherlandish artist and contemporary Flemish artists from Antwerp and Brussels, as well as the Italian paintings from the collections of Buckingham and Hamilton. The Archduke amassed about 1400 paintings, including the Large Mountain Landscape, which he then bequeathed to his son Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. The painting and the other artwork from Leopold's collection are today housed at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

He created a variety of works: fountains, memorials, freestanding sculptures, and architectural sculptures.  Biography  He was born in New York City, the son of Louis and Olga Shoreck Zimm. At age 13, Zimm began study at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools, where J.Q.A. Ward was among his instructors.Opitz, Glenn B, Editor, Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors & Engravers, Apollo Book, Poughkeepsie, NY, 1986, p. 1072. He studied privately for five years under Karl Bitter, for a year under Augustus Saint-Gaudens at the Art Students League of New York, then worked as a studio assistant to Saint-Gaudens. Zimm's early work included architectural sculpture for the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria, and an angel figure for Trinity Church Cemetery. He studied further in Paris, where he received an 1899 commission from the U.S. Government to create two sculpture groups for the upcoming Exposition Universelle (1900). > In the [American] section of \\"Varied Industries,\\" Mr. Bruno Louis Zimm of > New York has just finished the first of the two sculpture groups that are to > flank its entrance.

Following his return to New York City, Zimm created a statue of General Sherman, a sculpture group called Progress, and a number of bas-relief panels and portrait busts. Zimm was commissioned to create a statue of Sacagawea for the 1904 World's Fair. His research into her turned up new evidence: \\"A sculptor, Mr. Bruno Zimm, seeking a model for a statue of Sacagawea that was later erected at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, discovered a record of the pilot-woman's death in 1884 (when ninety-five years old) on the Shoshone Reservation, Wyoming, and her wind-swept grave.\\" Zimm also created the colossal Allegorical Figure of North Dakota for the Fair, one of fourteen seated sculptures representing the U.S. states that had been part of the Louisiana Purchase. In addition, he created architectural sculptures for some of the buildings. = Awards and honors = Zimm was awarded a Silver Medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition for his sculpture groups, The Art of Metalwork and The Art of Ceramics. He exhibited at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri; and the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. He was elected to membership in the National Sculpture Society in year. = Personal = In 1910 Zimm moved full-time to the Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, New York. In 1919 he married his second wife, Louise Seymour Hasbrouck.Who's Who in New York City and State, Volume 8 (New York: L. R. Hamersly Company, 1924), p. 1414.

Regional authorities agreed with the proposal. The plants manufactured products but ubnable to pay the dept, after which Tereshkov took another loans and bought two factories that owed him (two enterprises belonging to the Voskhod Association). In 1997, the Siberian Contract Corporation was renamed into the Siberian Grain Corporation.

It is a subterranean herb that has a horizontal rhizome and a head of up to sixty small white flowers with a pink tinge, surrounded by relatively large, cream-coloured to pale pinkish cream bracts. Description Rhizanthella johnstonii is a leafless, sympodial, subterranean herb with a horizontal rhizome below the soil surface with an erect peduncle up to long. Up to sixty small, white flowers tinged with pink are arranged in eight to twelve spiral rows, each with six to eight flowers wide, surrounded by six to eight cream-coloured to pale pinkish cream bracts. In other respects, it is similar to R. gardneri. Taxonomy and naming Rhizanthella johnstonii was first formally described in 2018 by Kingsley Dixon and Maarten Christenhusz in the journal Phytotaxa from specimens collected near a tributary of the Oldfield River by Alex George in 1979. The specific epithet (johnstonii) honours Lionel Johnston for his support to the author Dixon. Distribution and habitat Rhizanthella johnstonii is only known from the area around Munglinup where it grows in association with Melaleuca uncinata, M. hamata and an unnamed melaleuca of the M. uncinata complex. Ecology As with other orchids in the genus Rhizanthella, all parts of the life cycle of R. gardneri, including flowering, are subterranean. The orchid obtains its energy and nutrients as a myco-heterotroph via mycorrhizal fungi (Ceratobasidium sp.).

He held various senior positions within the Coast Guard. Van Boskerck would serve in the Coast Guard as commander of the Coast Guard cutters USCGC Bear, USCGC Yamacraw and also serve as commander of the Norfolk Division, district commander of the Great Lakes District, captain of the Port of Philadelphia, and commander of the Bering Sea Patrol. He wrote Semper Paratus's words in 1922 aboard the Yamacraw and its music in 1927 on a beat-up piano in the Aleutian Islands. He gave the song to Lieutenant Colonel Harvey Miller to publish the day before Van Boskerck died.  Early life and education  Van Boskerck was born in October 1868 and was a native of New York state. He was appointed to join the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction on May 17, 1889, as a cadet. The institution would become the United States Coast Guard Academy when the modern Coast Guard was formed by the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and Lifesaving Service in 1915. Until 1890, the School of Instruction was held on ships, when the first land-based campus for it was established in Curtis Bay, Maryland, likely making it where Van Boskerck lived. He received his commission into the Revenue Cutter Service upon graduating from the School, on May 20, 1891. After many years in the Coast Guard, Van Boskerck attended the Naval War College in 1923 and 1924. Upon leaving, he was made district commander of the Great Lakes District.  Career  Van Boskerck received a commission into the Coast Guard, then the Revenue Cutter Service on May 20, 1891. He would go on to serve twenty-three years of sea duty out of a thirty-six-year career, not leaving the Coast Guard until his death in 1927. He would rise through the ranks of the Coast Guard throughout his career, holding various senior positions. =Pre- and during World War I= Van Boskerck was first nominated for the rank of captain on May 14, 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt. Previously, he served as a first lieutenant. Van Boskerck's first prominent position was in 1914 and 1915, when he was tasked with overseeing the construction of the cutters and at Newport News, Virginia. In 1917, he was made captain of the Port of Philadelphia, while simultaneously being an aide for the Fourth Naval District there. He held these positions during the U.S. involvement in World War I, and was the first member of the Coast Guard to detect a German U-boat in the Atlantic. =Post-World War I= When the war ended, Van Boskerck was once again tasked with construction oversight, this time on repairs of the cutter USCGC Bear. In the summer of 1920, he commanded a cruise of the Bear to the Bering Sea. In 1922, he was placed in command of USCGC Yamacraw, headquartered in Savannah, Georgia, aboard which he wrote the lyrics to Semper Paratus. The vessel's primary mission at the time was to intercept illegal shipments of alcohol (during Prohibiton) aboard boats off the coast of Florida and the Carolinas. In 1923, Van Boskerck went to Newport, Rhode Island to attend the Naval War College, and in 1924 he was placed in command of the Great Lakes District. A year later, in 1925, he was named assistant inspector of the Northwest District. In 1925, he was put in command of the Bering Sea Patrol, headquartered in Unalaska, Alaska, and held the post into 1926. It was here he would write the music to Semper Paratus. In 1926, Van Boskerck returned to the East Coast and was named commander of the Norfolk Division in October in order to fill a vacancy. That fall, he took a week of leave and traveled to Washington, D.C., in order to discuss his retirement from the Coast Guard with Lieutenant Colonel Harvey Miller, also publisher and editor of Coast Guard Magazine. Miller offered him a job as national commander of the Army and Navy Union, which Van Boskerck was honored by. He would have been the first former Coast Guard member to hold the position. That day, he also persuaded Miller to publish Semper Paratus.  Creation of Semper Paratus  =Writing of Lyrics= In 1922, Van Boskerck was in command of the cutter USCGC Yamacraw, which chased boats smuggling then-illegal alcohol in the coastal waters of Florida and the Carolinas but was headquartered in Savannah, GA. It was near the shore of this city, where, in his cabin, Van Boskerck wrote the words to Semper Paratus. He wrote of the experience: He then presented the lyrics to the officers of the Yamacraw, expecting criticism. However, despite the fact that Van Boskerck had no musical training or experience, the officers loved the song and urged him to compose music, which he would do five years later. =Writing of Music= In 1927, Van Boskerck was in command of the remote Bering Sea Patrol, a post to which he had ascended in 1925 and 1926. It was here he was able to write the music to Semper Paratus, with the assistance of two dentists of the Public Health Service, Alf E. Nannestad and Joseph O. Fournier‚Äîthe latter of whom played the violin and was nicknamed \\"The Singing Dentist\\" for singing whilst working. They used a piano owned by Mrs. Albert Clara Gross, the wife of a local fur trader. Gross would often open her home to Coast Guardsmen. Her piano was in poor condition but it has been speculated that it was at the time \\"probably the only piano in the whole long chain of the Aleutian Islands.\\" =Publishing= Now that he had lyrics and music, Van Boskerck was ready to publish Semper Paratus. Later in 1927, he traveled to the East Coast and was named commandant of the Norfolk Division. While attending a dance held by the League of Coast Guard Women in Norfolk, he had the nine-piece orchestra play Semper Paratus in public for the first time. It was met with thundering ovations and multiple calls for encores. That fall, Van Boskerck traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss his retirement with Lieutenant Colonel Harvey Miller, who also served as the Coast Guard Magazine's editor and publisher. After this subject had concluded, Van Boskerck produced the lyrics and sheet music to Semper Paratus and said to Miller \\"In it I have tried to pour forth all the glory, honor, and tradition of the Coast Guard. It is an anthem of Coast Guard lore and history.\\" Less than an hour later, Miller promised to do everything in his power to get the song published. Semper Paratus was published in 1928 by the Sam Fox Publishing Company.  Death  After he delivered the words and music of Semper Paratus to Miller, Van Boskerck had intended to head to New York City for the Army- Navy football game that was to be held there. For an unknown reason, he instead decided to take a steamboat back to Norfolk. As he was leaving his room to disembark the vessel, he died abruptly of a heart attack. He had no known ailments at the time of his death. Van Boskerck died in the early hours of the morning on November 26, 1927. His death was reported by the Associated Press in The Evening Star that day.

From August 2001, Demenga was artistic director of the Davos Festival young artists in concert, which he directed for the last time in 2006.Conversation with Thomas Demenga At the Summer 2003 Lucerne Festival, Demenga performed as artiste √©toile. An extensive series of CD recordings, published by ECM, documents his artistic work. In 2002, the last CD of his recording of Bach's solo suites in combination with works by contemporary composers such as Heinz Holliger, Elliott Carter, S√°ndor Veress, Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Isang Yun and Toshio Hosokawa was released. Several of his recordings have been awarded the Vierteljahrespreis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik. He performs in concerts with fellow musicians such as Heinz Holliger, Gidon Kremer, Thomas Larcher, Paul Meyer, Aur√®le Nicolet, Hansheinz Schneeberger, Thomas Zehetmair and Tabea Zimmermann. Demenga has worked with conductors like Moshe Atzmon, Myung-Whun Chung, Charles Dutoit, Claus Peter Flor, Howard Griffiths, Heinz Holliger, Armin Jordan, Okko Kamu, Rostropovich, Dennis Russell Davies, Wolfgang Sawallisch, S√°ndor V√©gh, Mario Venzago and Hiroshi Wakasugi.Thomas Demenga on All Music He devotes himself especially to Neue Musik and also deals with improvisation. Thus his own musical language as a composer and interpreter of 20th and 21st century works (including many world premieres) forms a new and complementary dimension to the historical performance practice of Baroque music and his interpretations of the classical and romantic repertoire. He also represents these interests as artistic director, since 2011, of the chamber orchestra . In 1991, Demenga was the first Swiss composer to be awarded first prize at the International Rostrum of Composers in Paris for his work \\"solo per due\\" for two violoncellos.Thomas Demenga on Tarisio  References   External links   Category:Swiss cellists Category:Swiss composers Category:Juilliard School alumni Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bern ","title":"Thomas Demenga"},{"id":"65429154","text":"Action Books is an independent press housed at the English Department at University of Notre Dame.

It is now a ghost town. Since 1983, it has been known officially as Old Canonba. It lay on Duck Creek, a tributary of the Bogan River, approximately 30 km north-east of Nyngan.Part of Canonba c.1874 The two-storey building is probably John Brown's house.  History  = Aboriginal history = The area upon which Canonba lay is on the traditional lands of the Wangaaypuwan dialect speakers (also known as Wangaibon) of the Ngiyampaa people. After colonisation, although dispossed, the local people remained on their lands; as late as 1889, a corroboree took place near Canonba. The name Canonba may be derived from a local language word for the shingle-back lizard (Tiliqua rugosa). Early settlers recalled the word as Carringbung. = Settler colonisation and conflict = The association of colonial settlers with the area dates from the time of the second expedition of the explorer and surveyor-general Sir Thomas Mitchell, in 1835. Duck Creek was surveyed by James Larmer, an assistant-surveyor and second-in-command of the expedition. Mitchell returned to the area, in January 1847, when his third expedition camped for two weeks at the 'ponds of Canonba', which would later become the site of the village. The area between the Macquarie and the Bogan Rivers contains other watercourses, including Duck Creek, Gunningbar Creek, Crooked Creek and Marra Creek. Although the area was semi-arid, the watercourses, waterholes, and billabongs improved the potential of the area for grazing, encouraging some settlers to move into the area, even though the same water sources were precious to the traditional owners. It was outside the boundary of the area of the Nineteen Counties‚Äîwithin which the colonial government of New South Wales allowed settlers to purchase land‚Äîbut, after 1836, specific sections of land could be leased there for an annual payment. The area was the site of frontier violence in late 1841. Seeking water for their stock during a dry period, seven stockmen‚Äîworking for William Lee and Joseph Moulder‚Äîdrove 600 head of cattle off a legal grazing lease and into the area near the Canonba waterhole. It seems the cattle muddied and polluted the waterhole angering the traditional owners, who attacked the stockmen, killing three, and wounding three others. A stockman who was away from the main group, used his pistol to cover the wounded survivors as they escaped. Mounted Police from Bathurst, augmented by some stockmen, made a reprisal attack, at Duck Creek, that became a massacre. A contemporary report stated‚Äîalthough it was not known for certain how many died‚Äîthere were fifteen or as many as thirty Aborigines killed. Only three of the Aborigines who died were identified as being involved in the stockmen's deaths. The party captured three other Aboriginal men, supposed to be involved in the stockmen's deaths, one of whom later escaped. Even at the time, the actions of the Mounted Police were highly controversial. They had set out, during the absence of their commander, to assist the stockmen, who themselves had been acting illegally, carried out a frontier policing role normally that of the Border Police‚Äîunder the command of local Commissioner for Crown Lands, Allman‚Äîand had killed many Aborigines who, although of the same tribe, were innocent of the killing of the stockmen. For his part in causing the original trouble with the Aborigines, Governor Gipps revoked Lee's lease. Sadly, this was far from the only incident of horrific frontier violence and killing near the Bogan River during the 1840s. = The village of Canonba =  Growth and heyday  By the very early 1850s, squatters were taking up runs in the district officially. A prominent early settler was John Brown, who had a landholding called 'Canonba' on Duck Creek. A hotel and store were built on part of Brown's land and, in September 1853, the government reserved a piece of nearby Crown Land as the site of a village. This circumstance could have led to a settlement partially on the government village reserve‚Äîon the north-east side of Duck Creek‚Äîand partially on Brown's land, on the south-east, or left, bank. The privately-owned section was sometimes referred to as 'Brownstown'. However, a bridge crossing Duck Creek and connecting the two parts of the village site was not completed until 1874 and, probably for that reason, the village seems to have developed mainly on the south-west side of the creek. Canonba's position between between the Macquarie and Bogan Rivers, its water, and its good soil were advantages of its location. In 1858, a post office was opened there, with a police station following in 1864. The village was proclaimed in 1866 and a town plan published in the same year, making it one of the earliest official settlements of the region. During the next 15 years, the village grew to be the main settlement in the region west of Dubbo. It was the site of cattle and sheep sales, the point from which the mail service for Bourke started, and a stopping place on the Cobb & Co.'s stage coach route from Dubbo to Bourke. In 1870, Canonba was described as \\"rather a nice town, being built principally of brick, and is in the heart of one of the finest squatting districts in the colony.\\" By 1870, the village had a court of petty sessions, three public houses with a fourth on the way, some stores, and the usual trades of a rural settlement‚Äîsaddle and harness makers, blacksmiths, tailors, bootmakers, wheelrights‚Äîorchards and a vineyard; John Brown had built himself a double storey house of brick, overlooking what was by then being called a town, and a public schoolhouse awaiting a teacher. A school opened‚Äîunofficially‚Äîin 1872 but closed later, being without an officially appointed teacher. A new schoolhouse was built by the government and opened in 1878. By 1874, probably on the right bank of Duck Creek, there were two acres of vegetable gardens operated by ethnic-Chinese market gardeners. In 1881, the population reached what was probably its peak of 472.  Decline  In 1883, the Main Western railway line bypassed Canonba and instead ran to what is now the site of Nyngan‚Äîwhere the line crossed the Bogan River‚Äîresulting in the establishment of a rival settlement there around 1882. Another settlement nearby, Girilambone, was established as a mining village and was also on the railway line. These developments led to the almost total decline of Canonba, in only a few years. Many residents left Canonba and moved to Nyngan. A number of Canonba's houses and other buildings were pulled down and relocated to Nyngan. Businesses and public institutions followed. By 1887, the town no longer had a bank, just one public house and one store, and its church was described as \\"roofless walls\\", its belfry having been dismantled. John Brown, the 'King of Canonbar' and the driving force behind the village, although immensely wealthy, was in decline himself; around 1881, he had retired to Emu Hall at Emu Plains, where he died in 1888. The school closed in 1890. By the 1891 census, there were only 58 inhabitants and 12 dwellings left. The design of the village was altered to reduce the scale of the settlement and more realistically reflect its diminished future prospects. Canonba lingered on as a rural hamlet for a time, still significant enough to be a polling place into the early 1930s. It gave its name to the surrounding area and its Pasture Protection Board, then faded away completely. Canonba lost its status as a village, in 1983, and was officially renamed 'Old Canonba'.  Remnants  The old village site lies just on the upstream side of where the modern-day Canonba Road crosses Duck Creek. One of its streets, Duck Street, still appears on maps. All that is left of Canonba is its neglected cemetery and a boulder marked with a plaque that commemorates the former village.

Variant spelling: Obwoi; (Gworok): ; Jju: ; Hyam: Ku; Nghan: Nezhen; Hausa: ) is an African traditional religion institution which operated more like a cult of male ancestral spirits viewed as ghosts or reincarnates of the dead, whose physical forms remained invisible but voices audible, with origins among the central Nigeria plateau or Nenzit peoples such as the Adara, Atyap, Bajju, Bakulu, Batinor, Ham, Irigwe and others. Adherents were required to participate in frequent rituals within the year and a general communal worship once in a year, during which the oracles speak on sensitive issues concerning the community. Origins There seem to be no unifying tradition of origin on this religion. In other words, this suggests that the Abwoi cult is an ancient religion. =Nenzit= Atyap A tradition among the Atyap (proper) suggests that the Aku clan credited as the first settlers in the land who came out from the ground at the arrival of the Atyap hunters were the originators of Abwoi among that Atyap (Nenzit) sub-group, with some of the latter Abwoi types being of Atsam and Agworok origins. Atuk (March 2008: 30-33) noted that the idea of the Atyap religion (the Abwoi cult) was introduced by the Anghan, courtesy of the oral history narrated by an informant, Atyoli Abwui Kato, who narrated that: According to Atuk, this information sounds accurate as the genealogy of the woman in question has been found, furthering that Tokan Bukhwu was the first priest or , followed by Baghai Tokan. Bajju One of the traditional narratives in the Bajju area goes that the cult came from the village Tsoriyang of the Bayinhwan clan eight miles away from Zonkwa. Another claims that a man named Tawai brought it from the Irigwe country. A third claims it was of Ham origin. Gwong Among the Gwong, a tradition claims that the cult began in a village called Agabi and started only of recent, probably in the 19th century. =Other= A Gbagyi origin was suggested by Gunn (1956:79) for the cult's existence in the Southern Kaduna area, based on his \\"linguistical evidence\\" in which he presented that the Gbagyi word for 'calabash' or 'gourd' is 'obwe'/'obvwe'.Gunn p. 79 n 32 However, Isichei (1988:46) differed in view, stating that there was no mention of any cult called 'Abvwoi' (or 'Abwoi') from any available oral data of the Gbagyi. Alternatively, Gunn suggested that the cult was 'borrowed' from the Adara via the Bakulu.Isichei p. 46 Practices In the ancient practice, women were barred from entering into the shrine or to dance during cereminies organized by the Abwoi. It was an all-men affair i.e. only men were allowed and all adult males in each village belonged to the local Abwoi lodge after their initiation.Isichei p. 46 In the Atyap (proper) area, the Abwoi had a number of festivities, but the Ayet festival or Atyap Traditional New Year festival was the grandest. During the Ayet period, no man or woman was expected to spank a child. Any offender was made to pay a fine of two goats. Deaths, weddings and pounding at night were also viewed as bad omen during this period and women who pound at night were accused of pounding on their children's heads by the Abwoi, and were fined. During a communal annual ceremonial gathering, which usually lasted for a week, a whole community brings offerings of or in Jju (beer), cwan (beniseed), z√≥n or bvon in Jju (goats), nyw√°n (fowls), and (a semi-liquid delicacy made of coarse crushed corn grain particles and vegetables) to the (Gworok: ; Jju: ; English: Abwoi shrine). The shrine was large enough to accommodate 40 people at once. It was traditionally made circular in contrast to the normal houses which were oval shaped. The shrine housed the paraphernalia of the Abwoi.Isichei p. 47 The Agwam Abwoi (chief priest) afterwards sips some of the beer from the (small pot) and asks for a good agricultural year or season from the ancestors. Older initiated men usually went into the shrine, while the younger males and women stayed beneath a shade such as a large tree, while the ceremony commence. As at when dancing begins, the loud resonating voices of the Abwoi is heard from the concealed roof of the shrine disguised by the use of a two-ended large gourd, covered with spider's egg capsule. Initiation The exact general age of initiation is uncertain but the average age is about 10 years.Isichei (1988) p. 46 Among the Fantswam, male children were taken to the Abwoi shrine at an early age of between four to eight years. The young boys were kept for five days and warned to be obedient to their parents, obey the rule of law, and to keep the cult's secrets and told the consequence of revealing those secrets. They were also not allowed to leave the shrine; toilet facilities were made available in the shrine together with food and water. They also received serious beaten within the period and told if any reveals the cult's secrets to women, such would be killed and the corpse dragged into the forest.Isichei (1988) p. 46 Afterwards, a short ceremony follows and they were taken to the stream or river for a form of baptism, with their heads smeared with (mahogany oil). They were later handed over to their mothers at the shrine who welcomed and cleaned them up, as it was claimed that they were eaten off and vomited again by the Abwoi. The whole village then throws a feast for them. =Significance of the initiation= The initiation by 'swallowing and vomiting' signified the graduating of the male children into manhood, introducing them into the cult, and also remind them of the consequence of revealing the common secret. In his words, Atuk writes: =Consequences of revealing Abwoi secrets= Any amongst the initiated boys who would reveal the truth about the Abwoi cult would be taken back to the shrine and tried. If found guilty, his father would rub ashes on him (the symbol of mourning). Henceforth, that child would be impaled on a sharpened stake (a form of execution used by the Abwoi) and all the initiated would begin to sing and dance around to drown the screams of the victim. The women would hence be told that the boy had been 'swallowed' by the Abwoi. Secret of the Abwoi The common secret of the Abwoi among the Nenzit sub-groups (Atyap, Bajju, Agworok) was the disguise of the voice of the Abwoi by the use of a mechanism that makes it sound like the voice of the spirit of a dead ancestor. The device was crafted with the gourd of a snuff-box tree (oncoba spinosa; Hausa: Kukan ciki) by taking out the seeds from it and two holes borne on its opposite sides. One side was then connect to a bamboo stem and the other side of the gourd muffled with the webs of a spider to give a special sound effect.Gunn p. 79 n 32 The disguised voices come from both the main Abwoi speaker and from others in the shrine.Isichei p. 46-47 Types and offices of the Abwoi =Types= There were several types of Abwoi, each with its perculiar duties. These include: # LiÃ†m (Jju: ZabyyaÃ†; variant spelling: Zabieh): The most dreaded and terrifyin…° of all the Abwoi. It was responsible for 'swallows' and 'voming' children during and after the initiation ceremony. Its cry made the …°round trembled 'like an earthquake'. It had a gigantic appearance. # AÃ†bansop or Bansop; variant spelling: Bansip (Jju: Aninyet; variant name: Daniet): This also had a …°iantic appearance and looked like a forest due to its re…°alia being complete leaves from head down to the feet. It was usually confined around forested environments. It is made with bamboo frame covered with leaves and goes about at night.Isichei p. 48 # MapyiaÃ† (variant spellings: Mapio, Mapie, Mupie): This was sometimes re…°arded as AÃ†yang AÃ†bwoi (mother AÃ†bwoi). It did appear and cried in the ni…°ht to fri…°hten and scare the errin…° people especially, thieves. It was found mostly around streams. It is thought to be a male Abwoi which produces a feminine sound by ululation.Isichei p. 47 # AÃ†bwoi AÃ†gwoot: This was said to have been imported from Gworok (H. Kagoro). Its duty was mainly to watch over all theft scenarios in maize farms. Females were not involved in this very Abwoi practice, except initiation males. # Dankwari (Jju: Dankpari; variant spelling: Dangpari): This Abwoi was practiced mostly at night and involved two or more people, scattered around. When the one (the female) produced a sound wilily repeatedly, the other (the male) would respond with a hoarse humming voice, moving simultaneously. It was usually heard after harvest. Isichei p. 47 #AÃ†kursak (Jju: AÃ†kusak): The Kursak was an emissary of the Abwoi. It was earlier clothed with grasses, then leaves and recently with a colourful raffia costume. The Atyap's Kursak's crest or headpiece is more elaborate than the Bajju's Kusak's crest, but other features are more or less same. Isichei p. 49 #Alewa: This is a version of Kursak found among the Agworok, which speaks unlike the other Kursak which is mute. It usually appears in festivals, at the deaths of elders and during epidemics.Isichei p. 49 #Mbwoi (variant spelling: Mboi, Mbue): This was a visible masked spirit introduced in Gworok (Kagoro) in 1930 by the Ankwai in response to the wickedness of the then paramount ruler, Mugunta Atin. It was banned in 1933 by the British colonial government due to its violent tendencies. Isichei p. 52 =Offices= At the top was the office of the chief priest of the AÃ†bwoi cult, known as the (H. ) and there was the (wife of Abwoi) who was the (H. ) whose duty was the interpretation of the AÃ†bwoi's messa…°es. There were as well the (children of AÃ†bwoi's shrine) who numbered between 10 and 25, whose main duty was to answer the AÃ†bwoi's son…°. There was the office of (H. ; E. Abwoi Women Leader). Also, there were the , the or…°anizers of the various AÃ†bwoi feasts who supervised the compulsory brewin…° of or (beer/liquor) by the women. Akursak (The lesser Abwoi) The advent of lesser Abwoi called in Tyap or in Jju, was a sort of 'good news' to the women who were for the first time allowed to go into the shrine with men. The Kursak was said to have been introduced in Atyapland by the Batinor (Koro) people. It is normally a masked person (masquerade) who dances to the delight of the on-lookers, with his attire consisting of beautifully selected colours and woven in such a way that there are little air-spaces but no skin could be seen from outside. With the advent of the Kursak and with its attendant demands, women started composing songs to match with its dancing steps. The Kursak does not dance alone but specifically with a girl (not a woman). With him always is his \\"personal attendant\\" who continually sprays on him liquor, said to freshen him, being that his attire does not have adequate airspaces which would have allowed for easy breathing, according to Atyoli Nanam Kuje, an interviewee of Atuk's. =Rules= The worshippers (mainly men) were instructed to keep away from women during ceremonial periods. This rule was compulsory especially for him who is to be made a Kursak. It was believed that if the person isn't clean, when in the Kursak attire, the attire will eat deep into his flesh. Due to this, worshippers were advised to look clean both in body and in spirit. A lot of taboos abound in the Abwoi shrine, which worshippers were expected to keep sacred without violation. One of such is: While in the shrine, no worshipper was allowed to eat food or drink wine without the permit of the (Abwoi chief priest). The priest himself was as a matter of fact the disher of such things. Any worshipper who does contrary to those simple rules is bound to be expelled, since he would be regarded as a \\"sinner\\". The Abwoi practiced and imposed capital punishments on its erring members. A capital punishment usually goes to any member who reveals to his wife what the Abwoi is and what it looks like. It is interesting to note that the communication which transpired between a husband and his wife is known in the Abwoi's shrine. Investigation made it known that this was not an omnipresent attribute that could be associated with the Abwoi, but that the Abwoi had a complex network of spies and informants even among women. They knew women to be more talkative, hence, they cannot keep secrets, and they were bound to be heared. Once an initiated member violates the rule, the punishment was a capital one. Societal and social functions of the Abwoi In an oral interview with Atyoli K. Nka, conducted by Atuk, the Abwoi were also said to be worshipped as demi-gods by the people due to their proximity to them than the real Heavenly Father, Agwaza (Jju: KaÃ†za; Hyam: Nom). The Abwoi were said to have provided the people food and were capable of summoning them at odd times, especially in times of crises, to warn them about certain things; and also wielded supernatural powers used to heal the sick, especially children taken to them and make barren women conceive, hence, viewed as being \\"omnipotent\\". The Abwoi legislated by instituting strong laws and orders, as well as police the community to strictly implement them. In general, the AÃ†bwoi new farming year festival (T. Son…° AÃ†bwoi; J. Song AÃ†bvwoi) was held at the beginning of each rainy season at the end of April. It was a period when all the AÃ†bwoi were escorted to unknown destinations, farming activities commenced immediately. After their temporal exit, no sound of the AÃ†bwoi cry was heard. Nevertheless, it was unusual when cry of the AÃ†bwoi was heard at this time and may be viewed as a cry of a bad omen such as rampant cases of witchcraft or wizardry, outbreak of smallpox and other epidemics, natural disasters such as drought, flood, locust invasion, and so on. When such an unusual cry of the AÃ†bwoi was heard, the AÃ†gwam AÃ†bwoi (H. Ma…°ajin Dodo) does lead other elders to the AÃ†bwoi shrine where the AÃ†bwoi were called upon to tell the people why they cried. After which the people were warned to desist from their bad ways if that was the cause.

Ledlenser has its own offices in Italy (Led Lenser Italia Srl), Switzerland (Led Lenser Swiss GmbH), Japan (Led Lenser Japan, Inc.) and the United States (Ledlenser, Inc.). In the United Kingdom Ledlenser is exclusively distributed by Ledco Ltd. from a headquarters in Sunninghill, Berkshire. Production is handled by the 100% subsidiary, Ledlenser Corporation Ltd. in Yangjiang, a district-free city on the Chinese south coast in the province of Guangdong In January 2019, around 800 employees worked there. Products In addition to flashlights, headlamps, key lights and living room lights, the Ledlenser product range also includes explosion-proof lamps, diving lamps, and lamps that are tailored to the needs of fire brigade, rescue services, police and special units. =Flashlights= The Ledlenser program includes different flashlights of all sizes and for a wide variety of applications. The products are divided into series, which differ in terms of design, different lumens and the technology used. For example, the P series models are operated without programming, the M series lamps (M = microcontrolled) are equipped with a microchip programming. Ledlenser uses a proprietary measuring method for the runtime of the flashlights. The runtime specified by the manufacturer describes the duration the lamp takes for the brightness of the energy-saving level to drop to one lumen. For lamps without an energy-saving level (e.g. P3, P4, P5), the time is measured that elapses until the maximum brightness of the lamp has dropped to one lumen.Battery life is stated until the luminous flux drops to 1 lumen (see footnote) (Archive of the original from July 18, 2011 in the WayBack Machine) Some Ledlenser models are also equipped with a floating charge system which enables inductive charging without small or fault-prone charging plugs. The lamps have a metal switch at the end, which acts as a magnetic contact to the charging station. By bringing the two poles closer together, the lamp slides into the holder and charging begins. Thus flashlights are always charged and always ready to hand. =Headlamps= Ledlenser also develops headlamps for sport, outdoor use and professional use. With the headlamp NEO, XEO 19R, the SEO and H series, there are individual solutions for all areas. The headlamps are equipped with different lumens and running times. Sponsorship Ledlenser supports a so- called PRO team with national and international athletes in extreme and fun sports as brand ambassadors, including long-distance runner Jan Fitschen and extreme runner Christian Schiester. Corporate and social responsibility In 2020, Ledlenser were an official partner with M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors Without Borders).

The half-circle, fan- shaped windows on the fourth floor appear in numerous police dramas such as The Lineup in the 1950s and Ironside, the American television program starring Raymond Burr, in the 1960s. The San Francisco Hall of Justice is also frequently mentioned in the works of Dashiell Hammett and James Patterson. It was demolished in 1968. The current Hall of Justice, located at 850‚Äì880 Bryant Street (), served as the San Francisco Police Department's operational headquarters until 2015. It is internally referred to as \\"850 Bryant\\" and \\"the hall\\". The complex serves as the main San Francisco County Jail, as well as base of operations and headquarters for the San Francisco Sheriff's Department, and garage for the majority of vehicles for the SFPD. The San Francisco Police motorcycle traffic division is completely based there as well. In 1994, the Hall was renamed for Thomas J. Cahill, the Chief of the SFPD from 1958 to 1970.

Incumbent deputy leader and sitting List MP, Ron Mark was challenged for the position by fellow list MP Fletcher Tabuteau. In the election Tabuteau won the required number of votes and replaced Mark as deputy leader of the party. Background rumors that incumbent deputy leader Ron Mark, who had successfully challenged deputy leader Tracey Martin in 2015 was set to be rolled by a member of the NZ First caucus were first published in a Stuff.co.NZ article on February 22, with the only candidate being list MP Fletcher Tabuteau. Other possible candidates Tracey Martin and Shane Jones had both ruled themselves out, both citing their heavy ministerial workloads that had taken on after the formation of the Coalition government at the 2017 New Zealand general election. Prior to the leadership election, a change of hands seemed all but guaranteed, with stuff citing that party leader Winston Peters, who was assumed to have voted for Mark's opponent Martin in the 2015 deputy leadership election, would probably be throwing his support behind Tabuteau, who was a close ally of his.

Aftermath The deputy leadership election was held by the NZ First caucus on 27 February 2018, with Tabuteau, as expected, gaining the needed 5 caucus votes to roll Mark as deputy leader. Following the election, Mark stated he was privileged to have held the role, and looked forward to being able to focus on his ministerial profiles of Veterans' Affairs and Minister of Defence, and that losing the deputy leadership freed him up to win the Wairarapa electorate come the 2020 New Zealand general election.

Development  The Durand de Le Penne- class are escort and combat class ships, able to operate in every combat condition, and especially devised to survive to heavy missile and aircraft attacks. Its construction is made almost totally with steel; the structure is a continuous deck with a low, large stern, to accommodate the helicopter force. The fore hull is very pointed, with a very pronounced sea-cutter structure. The superstructure consists of two blocks, relatively low and wide, both with a high, antenna mast with a triangular cross-section for all the electronic. The engines exhausts are in two groups, one for each superstructure: the aft has two exhausts flank to flank, slightly inclined. Then there is the Standard missile system and finally the helicopter facilities.  Construction and career  She is laid down on 15 November 1989 and launched on 13 April 1991 by Fincantieri shipyards. Commisioned on 18 October 1993 with the hull number D 561. Francesco Mimbelli suffered a fire in one of the engine rooms, while it was underway, as part of Operation Safe Sea on 29 December 2019. The fire-fighting teams on board, specially trained to deal with these emergencies, intervened effectively, immediately securing the unit and extinguishing the fire, without any consequences or damage to the crew.

Built in 1931 in a Tudor style, it is notable for its use of clear glass windows and the view over Waiho Gorge from its altar. This view originally included Franz Josef Glacier, a famous scene recorded on a 1946 Peace Stamp, but the glacier has since receded.  Background  The Ross and South Westland parish was created in 1867, but a church at Franz Josef was not proposed until 1925. Reverend James R. Young (vicar of the parish 1923‚Äì1928) suggested a building of riverstone, and a site was donated by Peter and Alec Graham, notable climbing guides and operators of the Franz Josef Glacier Hotel. Plans were drawn up by Maurice Guthrie, but these were rejected as being too expensive for the nine Anglican families of the area. Archdeacon Julius visited Westland in February 1927, and afterwards suggested a wooden church with views of the Waiho River and Franz Josef Glacier. Plans were commissioned from James S. Turnbull and Percy Watts Rule of Timaru in 1928.  Construction  Foundation stone The site was cleared for building in March 1930, tenders were called in November of that year, and a contract for the construction was awarded to Bullock and Stewart in 1931. The foundation stone for the church was laid by the Governor-General, Lord Bledisloe, in early February 1931. The construction cost of the church was around ¬£1000‚Äì1400. 1946 \\"A Spirit of Thankfulness\\" Peace Stamp The dedication ceremony was held on 26 April 1931 by Bishop West-Watson of Christchurch, assisted by Reverends James R. Young (then of HƒÅwera) and A.K. Warren, vicar of Ross and South Westland, in front of a congregation of 150. The church was dedicated to St James, but named in part to honour James Young, who had proposed it be built, in recognition of his services to the community. View in 1998 through the central apsidal window of St James Church, looking across the Waiho River with Franz Josef Glacier visible beyondThe church is described as of 'Selwynesque' or Tudor in style. The walls are constructed of board-and-batten, with a corrugated iron roof. There is castellated bell tower. The church is decorated with a highly distinctive style, with dark brown paint used to highlight the exterior battens and roof trusses. Rather than the more usual stained glass windows, the building features three clear plate glass apsidal windows, overlooking the Waiho River. When the church was built it also had a view of the Franz Josef Glacier, but by 1953 this had retreated out of view. From 1985 to 2006, the glacier generally advanced and thickened, and by 1997 it was once again visible through the altar window before retreating again.  History  The rise of the Waiho River between 1936 and 2018 can be seen in these two photos of St James The more famous Church of the Good Shepherd at Lake Tekapo also incorporates clear glass windows to allow for a view of the lake, a feature which was inspired by the prior use at St James. The church achieved national recognition when the view across the altar to the mountains was featured on a 9d Peace stamp entitled \\"A Spirit of Thankfulness\\", issued in 1946 to commemorate the end of World War Two. On 28 June 1990, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) as a Category I structure, with register number 4994. The building is considered notable for the way in which it complements its bush surroundings, and the use of clear glass windows behind the altar. In December 1995, of rain fell over a three-day period, washing away the northern approach to the Waiho River bridge, and gouging out the river bank to within of St James Church. In September‚ÄìOctober 1996, civil works costing $300,000, including a contribution of $50,000 from the Anglican Church Property Trust, were completed to protect both the bridge approaches and the church from future flood events.

Inspired by current international political trends, Boris described the album as \\"a mirror that gathers and reflects people‚Äôs negative energy at a different angle, one that is positive.

It includes the cover song \\"Fundamental Error\\" by 1990s Japanese hardcore band Gudon. Japanese hardcore guitarist Katsumi makes a guest appearance. The album was self- released. Critical reception Upon its release, the album received mostly positive reviews. Sputnikmusic noted the album's differences from its immediate predecessors, which could turn off longtime fans although the album \\"plays to enough of Boris‚Äô many strengths that longstanding fans will be quick to pounce on it.\\" Pitchfork called No the best Boris album in a decade, squeezing the band's many interests into \\"these breathless 40 minutes.\\" Treble magazine noted that the album \\"cuts right through the feedback and drone in the interest of a more direct delivery of thrashy riffs and crust-punk intensity.\\" Post-Thrash noted that the album is likely to satisfy both longtime Boris fans, plus fans of hardcore punk and heavy metal.

Protest locations included Cairo, Giza, Suez, Kafr El Dawwar, Alexandria, Aswan, El Qanater El Khayreya, Faiyum, Minya and Luxor. The sixth day of protests, on 25 September, was called a \\"Day of Rage\\". Background Mass protests in the Egyptian revolution of 2011 led to the demission of President Hosni Mubarak, the 2012 Egyptian presidential election won by Mohamed Morsi, the 2012‚Äì13 Egyptian protests against the Morsi presidency, the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat which overthrew Morsi, the August 2013 Rabaa massacre by the security forces and army led by general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and an authoritarian government under Sisi, who was elected president with no serious opponents in 2014 and 2018. In September 2019, Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian construction contractor living in exile in Spain, circulated videos accusing el-Sisi and the military of extensive corruption and called for street protests to force el-Sisi to resign. Protests took place on 20‚Äì21 September 2019, after which Amnesty International described the Sisi government being \\"shaken to its core\\", Protests continued on 27 September. The Egyptian authorities responded with arrests of protestors and lawyers. Well-known arrestees included the Egyptian blogger, software developer and activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who had not participated in the 2019 Egyptian protests, arrested on unknown charges, and his lawyer Mohamed al-Baqer, director of the human rights organisation Adalah Center for Rights and Freedoms. Both were tortured in welcome parades in Tora Prison. Amnesty described the crackdown as the biggest during the el-Sisi presidency. =August 2020 call for protests= A Twitter campaign with an Arabic hashtag equivalent to #We Don't Want You started on 29 August 2020 after el-Sisi suggested that a referendum could be called to dismiss him from the presidency if people were unsatisfied with his decisions. The campaign, supported by Mohamed Ali, called for el-Sisi to step down and for protests on 20 September 2020, the anniversary of the 2019 protests. Housing demolotions were another key factor motivating the protests in poor communities, both urban and rural. Egyptian security forces attempted to prevent protests by arresting political figures, including Amin al-Mahdi, and activists, especially in Suez. Cafes were forced to close. September 2020 Protests started on 20 September in Giza and in several suburbs in Cairo, calling for el-Sisi to step down. Authorities' reactions included live bullets and tear gas. Protests calling for el-Sisi's resignation also took place in Suez, Kafr El Dawwar, Alexandria, Aswan, and El Qanater El Khayreya. In Aswan, security forces attacked the protestors, who set a presidential building on fire in response. People in Kadiya in Giza Governorate, angry at the demolitions of buildings claimed by the government to have been illegally built, turned over a police truck. Protests continued on 21 and 22 September. Protest locations on 22 September included Giza, Faiyum, Minya, Luxor and Aswan. In the village of al-Kadaya in Atfih, protestors refused a police objection to the holding of a protest by overturning a police car and setting it on fire. In al-Hawarta in Minya Governorate, protestors pushed a police vehicle into a canal. Calls for more protests continued, calling for a \\"Friday of Anger\\" (or \\"Day of Rage\\") protests. Mohamed Ali claimed that the numbers of protestors were rising daily. Ali argued in favour of a critical protest mass, stating \\"If five million people took to the streets, no one would be arrested at all.\\" On 25 September, protests took place in Cairo, Giza, Luxor and Damietta Governorate after the Friday prayer session, again calling for el-Sisi to resign. Civil disobedience techniques used by protestors included burning tyres to block roads. Videos posted on social media since September 20 appeared to show several very small demonstrations involving up to several dozen people in different parts of the country. Confrontations between police and protestors continued on 30 September in the village of al-Awamiya in Luxor, with a fatal shooting of a protestor. The sequence of events started with troops and armoured vehicles arriving at the village. Police raided al-Rawi's home, trying to arrest Awais al-Rawi's younger brother. A police officer insulted and slapped al-Rawi's father, who objected to the arrest. Awais al-Rawi objected verbally about the treatment of his father and the argument escalated. A police officer shot Awais al-Rawi four times using a \\"side arm\\", once in the face, killing him. The funeral took place the same day. Mourners chanted against the police and el-Sisi, calling el-Sisi \\"the enemy of God\\". Police fired warning shots and teargas and arrested 20 funeral participants. Mourners kidnapped and beat a police officer. The officer was released after hours of negotiation between police and tribal elders. A video of the funeral was posted under a trending hashtag with the Arabic equivalent of \\"Friday we're coming out in our millions.\\" The officer suspected of the shooting of Awais al-Rawi was suspended from duty, according to a leak from the prosecutor's office. Coordination Rutgers University law professor Sahar Aziz described the protests as decentralised, with no leadership by known opposition groups. The uprising has been labeled the galabiya uprising due to the protests taking place mostly in rural areas and Upper Egypt where there is less security than in the main squares in big cities. Deaths and injuries One protestor in the 25 September protests in al-Blida in Giza Governorate, Sami Wagdy Bashir, was killed, and three others were wounded, according to the human rights group Najda. Detentions On 23 September 2020, the number of people detained as a result of the protests was estimated as 200 by Middle East Monitor. Among these, 150, including 14 minors according to the Belady Foundation, appeared at State Security institutions and were charged with \\"belonging to a terrorist organization, spreading false news, and misuse of social media. Four Warraq Island protestors were arrested in the Warraq Island protest ongoing since 2017. Khaled Ali and other lawyers stated that there was similar confusion to the arrests following the 2019 protests, with difficulty in contacting the detainees' families. On 28 September 2020, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms said that at least at least 382 people had been detained since 20 September.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt- politics/several-hundred-arrests-amid-protest-calls-in-egypt-rights-group- idUSKBN26J2QZ Fake videos According to Mada Masr, United Media Services Group (UMSG), which is owned by one of the Egyptian intelligence agencies (Mukhabarat, military intelligence, National Security Agency) and owns Youm7, prepared fake protest videos, including one of a would-be protest in Nazlit al-Samman in Giza Governorate. UMSG sent the videos to Al Jazeera and to international media associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, including El Sharq TV. Both Al Jazeera and El Sharq broadcast the videos, presenting them as genuine. UMSG presented this as evidence that \\"enemy media\\" were careless in verifying the authenticity of their material.

The caves are also known as those of Mchishta after a karst river effluxing from the base of the rock. The openings are at least partially artificial. Local legends and a scholarly hypothesis suggest religious use in the Middle Ages, but the exact function and timing remains unknown.  Description  The cave entrances are located at the height of several metres above the ground surface and arranged in several tiers. They are rectangular in shape, ostensibly human-hewn, and faced by stones, joined together with lime mortar. Each of these caves is a narrow grotto of about 2 to 3 metres in width, but as high as 15 metres. Wooden details of rock-hewn openings have survived. According to local legends, the caves used to house a community of monks, but later it was used as a shelter for brigands. In the latter half of the 19th century, a nobleman from Otkhara, Mazhar Shervashidze, led a group of locals in an attempt to explore the caves. He was able to ascend the first tier and reportedly recovered a couple of silver objects, the subsequent fate of which is unknown. It was only in 1958 that the caves were first explored scientifically, by a group of specialists from Tbilisi with the help of rockclimbers.

The film is the sequel to 2006's Borat. It is scheduled to be released on October23, 2020, on Amazon Prime Video in the United States.  Premise  Fourteen years after release of Borat, Borat Sagdiyev returns to the United States from Kazakhstan and this time he discovers more about American culture, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020 elections. Cast * Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Sagdiyev, a Kazakhstani news reporter who has achieved international fame and notoriety after the events of the first film. * Irina Nowak as Tutar Sagdiyev, Borat's daughter. Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani and Judith Dim Evans appear as themselves. Production =Development= Rupert Murdoch announced in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had signed on to do another Borat film with 20th Century Fox, distributor of the first film. BaronCohen later claimed that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection as he did in the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea. In 2014, he brought back Borat for the FXX series AliG: Rezurection, a compilation of the sketches from Da AliG Show with new footage. He also briefly appeared as Borat in December2015 on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! to promote the film Grimsby and again in November2018 to encourage Americans to vote in that year's midterm elections. In the two years leading up to the release, the film's star became more concerned about being politically active, giving speeches and interviews in-person to combat racism; he insisted on releasing the film immediately before the election to provoke alarm among Americans about a slide into illiberal democracy. =Filming= Mike Pence at the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference, shortly before BaronCohen interrupted his speech. An early prank filmed in late 2019 involved a farcical interview with Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. In February2020, BaronCohen was spotted dressed up as Donald Trump, interrupting the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), although his true identity was not revealed at the time. That same month, BaronCohen traveled to Macon, Georgia to trick attendees of a fake cotillion. In early July2020, BaronCohen arranged a fake interview with Rudy Giuliani, only to burst in during the conversation wearing a pink bikini; Giuliani called the police. A few weeks later, he was spotted performing pranks at a gun rally in Olympia, Washington, leading attendees to sing along with racist lyrics to an original song, and interviewing members of the crowd. The following month, he was spotted in Los Angeles dressed as Borat and filming, leading to speculation from the public that BaronCohen's next project was a Borat sequel. On two days of filming BaronCohen was required to wear a bulletproof vest due to the possible threats of the scene. In early September2020, rumors began to circulate claiming that the film was completely shot, assembled, and screened for film industry executives; the title was originally leaked as Borat 2: Great Success and then Borat: Gift of Pornographic Monkey to Vice Premiere Mikhael Pence to Make Benefit Recently Diminished Nation of Kazakhstan. Release In September2020, Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film and scheduled it for an October23 release. The first trailer was released on October 1, 2020, confirming that several of BaronCohen's pranks were shot for this film. BaronCohen joined social media outlets Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter in-character as Borat to comment on American politics in the run-up to the election and promote the film release. He also made a return to Jimmy Kimmel Live! a few days before the film's release. Controversy The film's creators were sued for fraud after including an interview with Holocaust survivor Judith Dim Evans. Evans died before the film's release but her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that she did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness in the film. In a rare move for the prankster, BaronCohen claimed that he revealed to Evans that the piece was a bit to reduce her concern about the anti-Semitic comments that Borat makes.

It has resulted in seven indictments and two arrests. The scandal involved the aggressive stalking and harassment of two e-commerce bloggers, Ina and David Steiner, who wrote frequent commentary about eBay on their website EcommerceBytes. EcommerceBytes EcommerceBytes was founded in 1999, four years after eBay was founded. Initially called AuctionBytes, the website offered advice to buyers in the early days of internet commerce. In the years after its founding, the website became a resource for sellers on a number of platforms, from Etsy to Amazon, a kind of trade publication for anyone whose business is selling items online. The website not only offered advice, but also critiques of eBay's corporate and policy changes. Stalking and harassment In January 2019, Elliott Management purchased a significant investment in EBay. They sent a letter to its board of directors requesting changes, saying that EBay \\"as a public- company investment has underperformed both its peers and the market for a prolonged period of time.\\" This was interpreted as placing additional demands on EBay management to produce results, leading to an atmosphere of heightened stress throughout the company. Members of eBay's executive leadership had long been bothered by the couple's posts. Under pressure in early 2019 to enhance performance, the company felt a new sense of urgency. The Steiners were harassed and threatened both online and physically in their home by deliveries of such things as a bloody pig mask, live cockroaches, funeral wreath, and large orders of pizza. Employees flew from California to Boston so they could vandalize the couple's Natick, Massachusetts home as well as stalk their personal vehicle. Plans were even made to break into the couple's garage and place a GPS tracker on their car.  Charges filed  In June 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six former eBay employees and contractors with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses; a seventh former employee was charged in July. Two former employees were charged and arrested. They are: * James Baugh of San Jose, California. He was eBay‚Äôs Senior Director of Safety & Security. * David Harville of New York City. He was eBay‚Äôs former Director of Global Resiliency. Five former employees were charged but not arrested. Each of these individuals was charged with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses. They will be required to make appearances in federal court in Boston. They are: * Stephanie Popp of San Jose, California. She was formerly eBay‚Äôs Senior Manager of Global Intelligence. * Stephanie Stockwell of Redwood City, California. She was formerly the manager of eBay‚Äôs Global Intelligence Center (GIC). * Veronica Zea of San Jose, California. She had served as an eBay contractor working as an intelligence analyst in the GIC. * Brian Gilbert of San Jose, California. He had been a Senior Manager of Special Operations for eBay‚Äôs Global Security Team. * Philip Cooke of San Jose, California. He was charged in July 2020, in distinction to the others, who were all charged on June 15, 2020. He was a supervisor of security operations. Cooke had formerly worked as a police captain in Santa Clara.

This article focuses on the use of vertical banners as protest banners in Hong Kong.  Introduction  Small election campaign vertical banner seen in July 2013. English-language banners are often horizontally written, but because Chinese characters are traditionally written vertically and are read from top to bottom, Chinese characters on banners have the options to be vertically scripted, or horizontally written. Normally, smaller vertical banners in Hong Kong are used as election campaign material or as advertisement tactic. One may also see them hung on street lamps as celebratory decoration occasionally. = Used as protest banners = Smaller hand-held vertical protest banners on 2010 during the June 4th Massacre anniversary vigil. The banner stated \\"Hold Them Responsible For The Slaughter\\". During mass protests and demonstrations dozens, and sometimes, hundreds, of Hong Kong protest marchers would hold up long banners horizontally so onlookers from high-rise buildings can see the words from above. In general, Cantonese characters and written Chinese are both used in these vertical protest banners. On the other hand, while most of these vertical protest banners were written in traditional Chinese characters, occasionally simplified Chinese, a product created by Communist China since the Cultural Revolution in 1949, are used in these protest banners for their negative connotations and cynical association with Communist China. In Hong Kong, with its native tongue being Cantonese and native written language being traditional Chinese characters, the controversy over traditional and simplified Chinese can be easily detected on these vertical protest banners. While banners, large and small, vertical and horizontal, have been used throughout Hong Kong since as early as 1967, and most frequently during the annual Tienanmen Square Massacre march and vigil since 1989, it was the Umbrella Movement of 2014 marked the beginning of the uniquely Hong Kong hill- top vertical protest banners movement. A group of rock climbing activists decided to unfurl a 30-meter vertical protest banner on Lion Rock and document their descent on YouTube. At the time, even some Hong Kong citizens thought it was a joke. The yellow fabric echoed the iconic yellow helmet in the Umbrella Movement. Since then, many more hill-top banners have shown up throughout Hong Kong, and the messages to the government also become increasing harsh as Hong Kong authorities and Chinese government continue to crack down on dissents. The defining moment of vertical protest banners in Hong Kong protest. The banner reads \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\". Picture taken on October 24, 2014. The vertical protest banners documented below often showcase the Chinese character \\"Êàë\\", which literally translates as \\"I\\". However, as Hong Kong citizens protest in solidarity in thousands and sometimes in millions, the banners will be translated into \\"we\\". All Chinese characters on the banners are written here exactly as is.  Prior to Umbrella Movement  = 1989 Tienanmen Square Massacre = 2009 anniversary march marked the 20th year of the Tienanmen Square Massacre. Originally a bridge-length vertical protest banner to commemorate those who died in the hands of Communist China, now the phrase is painted, and repainted, annually on June 4th, on the Tai Koo bridge of Hong Kong University. On June 4, 1989 after the Massacre took place, Hong Kong University students lay out a bridge-length black vertical protest banner and painted in white the phrase \\"Cold-Blooded Slaughters Will Not Kill Their Spirit; Vow to Revenge Democracy Never Dies\\"„ÄåÂÜ∑Ë°ÄÂ±†ÂüéÁÉàÂ£´Ëã±È≠Ç‰∏çÊúΩ Ë™ìÊÆ≤Ë±∫ÁãºÊ∞ë‰∏ªÊòüÁÅ´‰∏çÊªÖ„Äçto show support of democracy and to condemn the Chinese government. Although the black vertical protest banner was only hung for one day, the white paint that leaked through the fabric and left on the bridge become a piece of historic artifact of the banner's existence. Thereafter, annually, Hong Kong University students would repaint these twenty words directly on the bridge concrete. This is probably the first vertical pro-democracy protest banner in Hong Kong. As time passes, the June 4th commemoration vigil in Hong Kong would always be held at night in Victoria Park, since the massacre in 1989. The weekend before June 4th, or if June 4th lands on a weekend, there would be a massive rally on the streets of Causeway Bay to demand accountability from the Chinese officials as authorities still denied to this date. The vertical protest banner shown here was from the 2009--20th anniversary--march, on which \\"Dare Not Forget June Fourth\\" („ÄåÊØãÂøòÂÖ≠Âõõ„Äç) and \\"Remember June Fourth 20th Anniversary\\" („ÄåÁ¥ÄÂøµÂÖ≠Âõõ20ÈÄ±Âπ¥„Äç). In 2020, Hong Kong authorities for the first time denied the vigil citing pandemic health concerns, and later arrested many for unlawful gathering. = 2007 Queen's Pier Preservation = 2007 vertical banners hung from the pier's rooftop. Hundreds of protesters stayed around-the-clock to block the demolition of the British colonial relic Queen's Pier. White vertical banners were seen being hung from the roof of the pier as hunger strikes continued for days. The readings, from left to right, roughly translated as \\"Need One More of You\\", („ÄåÂ∑Æ‰Ω†‰∏ÄÂÄã„Äç), \\"Safeguard the Queen('s Pier)\\" („Äå‰øùË°õÁöáÂêé„Äç), \\"Fight To The Death\\" („ÄåÂêå‰Ω¢Ê≠ªÈÅé„Äç) and \\"Government Coerces Citizens Revolt\\" („ÄåÂÆòÈÄºÊ∞ëÂèç„Äç). This preservation campaign has been considered as the birth of Hong Kong's localist movement as younger Hong Kong citizens identified more as independent Hong Kongers. = 2014 Northeast New Territories Development Protest = The protest against government's lack of consultation with original inhabitants of the remote area and the lack of Hong Kong ecological and cultural preservation in this new housing development proposal drew ire to thousands of Hong Kong citizens. More over, the Legislative Council budget committee passed the budget proposal without following proper procedures. The two persons climbing to the top of a pedestrian bridge roof to hang four banners was opposition leader Cheung Kwai-choi and a social activist Chow Nok Hang. He unfurled four vertical protest banners lined by 50,000 signatures in red color from Hong Kong citizens opposing the development with black fonts. He was later fined a thousand HKD for disobeying executive orders, and may have been the first Hong Kong citizen fined by hanging vertical protest banners. = September 22, 2014 College Boycott = First higher education strike in Hong Kong on September 22, 2014, leading to the official beginning of the Umbrella Movement four days later.Over 13,000 college students gathered in Hong Kong Chinese University (CUHK) on the first day of the Hong Kong class boycott campaign to demand universal suffrage and democracy in response to Beijing's denial on August 31. Other demands included increasing social inequality and increase government transparency and officials' accountability. The strike was supported by academic professors for a better Hong Kong and would later turn into the 2014 Umbrella Movement as Hong Kong government continued to ignore their demands. There were two black banners hung vertically in the main atrium of CUHK. They read \\"We Decide Our Fate Boycott Must Go On\\" („ÄåÊäóÂëΩÊçâÁ∑äÂëΩÈÅã ÁΩ∑Ë™≤‰∫ãÂú®ÂøÖË°å„Äç). The three vertical banners seen on protest ground of CUHK were considered a literary triplet and should be read together. The two black and one red banners written in white paint should be read from right to left: \\"Future Uncertainties Can Be Solved By Humanity-Focused Democracy\\" („ÄåÂÇ≥‰∫∫Êú¨‰πãÈÅì„Äç„ÄåÊéàÊ∞ë‰∏ªÂü∫Ê•≠„Äç„ÄåËß£Êú´‰æÜ‰πãÊÉë„Äç).  2014 Umbrella Movement  = September‚ÄìNovember, 2014 Harcourt Road, Admiralty = Vertical protest banners showing demands and inspirational phrases during the Umbrella Movement. 2014. Popular song lyric on an orange vertical protest banner on September 30, 2014. The black vertical protest banner read 'Citizens Resist\\", and the two white banners, as a couplet, from right to left, read \\"Fake Universal Suffrage Discriminate Against the Poor; Genuine Universal Suffrage Makes Everyone Equal\\". Photo date October 24, 2014. Dissatisfaction toward both Hong Kong and China government led to a 79-day stand-off between ordinary citizens and high-power government officials. During the Umbrella Movement most of Admiralty has been closed off and many vertical banners were hung from the pedestrian bridges perpendicular to Harcourt Road. Merging art, music and politics together, some of these banners were inspirational song lyrics, such as \\"Embrace Freedom In the Midst of Storm\\" („ÄåÈ¢®Èõ®‰∏≠Êä±Á∑äËá™Áî±„Äç) from Beyond's song Êµ∑ÈóäÂ§©Á©∫ (\\"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies\\"). Others were rhyming phrases and drawings showing protesters' demands. = October 22, 2014 Lion Rock = Hill-top banner appeared for the first time on Lion Rock in Hong Kong, October 23, 2014. This event is now commonly considered as the first documented hillside banner hanging in Hong Kong. A local rock climbing group called \\"Hong Kong Spidie\\" claimed responsibility for hanging up the 28-meter yellow vertical banner that read \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç) in black font with an umbrella symbol over Lion Rock. Andreas, the rock-climbing group's leader, would famously put on a Spider Man costume when interviewed, claiming that the Spider Man persona symbolized a normal teenager doing good deeds to better the society. The group released two videos on YouTube that morning: one was a manifesto video explaining Lion Rock as the climb site to show the Hong Kong Lion Rock Spirit. Another video was a behind- the-scene video capturing the climb preparation, the actual descent on the Rock, and the unfurling of the vertical protest banner. = October 27-28, 2014 Hong Kong University and Hong Kong Chinese University = The now-famous yellow vertical protest banner \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage #Umbrella Movement\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç) was found hanging inside Hong Kong University campus and outside a medical staff dormitory building of Prince Whales Hospital of Hong Kong Chinese University in Sha Tin. = November 1, 2014 Kowloon Peak and Tai Po = Another \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\" vertical protest banner found on Kowloon Peak on November 1, 2014. Tai Po has not been a protest hotspot in 2014. Picture taken on November 1, 2014. Another familiar yellow- with-black-font \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage #Umbrella Movement\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç) banner was unfurled but this time at Kowloon Peak that is located next to Lion Rock. More identical banner showed up in Tai Po. = November 3, 2014 Next Media Headquarter in Tseung Kuan O = More happenings of the hanging of \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage #Umbrella Movement\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç) and this time the banner was located on the building of a pro-democracy print newspaper Apple Daily headquarter. The banner was funded by newspaper staff donation, according to news report. = December 9‚Äì11, 2014 Harcourt Road, Admiralty = \\"We Will Be Back\\" banner ended the Umbrella Movement after 79 days of occupying Admiralty, on December 11, 2014 On the final days of the Umbrella Movement, two over-sized vertical banners, both were yellow with black font, were among the hundreds of pieces of protest materials being cleaned out. The smaller one of the two was originally spread out over Harcourt Road and then later vertically hung on a lamppost that showed \\"WE WILL BE BACK\\", in capitalized English and \\"Citizens swear to return\\" („Äå‰∫∫Ê∞ëË™ìÂøÖÊ≠∏‰æÜ„Äç) in Chinese. Another one was horizontally spread out on the occupied Harcourt road, showing in Chinese \\"Stand With Students\\" („ÄåÊíëÂ≠∏Áîü„Äç). Four days later, Hong Kong government reclaimed the three occupied locations and declared the end of the 79-day movement. = December 13, 2014 Lion Rock and Devil's Peak = As the Umbrella Movement approached its final days, Hong Kong citizens reported sightings of two vertical protest banners today. The one found on Lion Rock showed \\"Down With CY\\" („ÄåCY‰∏ãÂè∞„Äç), referring to the then Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying (CY Leung) and the one on Devil's Peak displayed \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç).  Post-Umbrella Movement  Many Hong Kong citizens felt a sense of loss after the Umbrella Movement ended; many activists were arrested and imprisoned, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments continued to suppress their voices such as disqualifying young, localist legislative council candidates on the grounds of lacking national patriotism. For example Nathan Law, the youngest elected Legislative Council member, was disqualified by a judge for taking the oath insincerely. Fewer and fewer young people remembered or attended the annual June Fourth Tienanmen commemoration each year. The 2016 Mongkok Civil Unrest, also known as \\"Fishball Revolution\\", markedly show the impatience of Hong Kong people after nearly 20 years of fighting for democracy and the beginning of a more violent clashing with authorities. However, hill-top vertical protest banners continue to surprise, reigniting people's desire to true dual universal suffrage: voting rights to both Hong Kong's Chief Executive and Legislative Council. = 2014 =  December 15, 2014 Victoria Peak  The day following the cleanup Hong Kongers woke up to two large hill-top vertical banners one hung on Victoria Peak of Hong Kong Island, another one reportedly in Kowloon. The one found over Victoria Peak was the usual yellow-with-black font with an umbrella symbol reminding Hong Kong citizens to \\"Never Forget Our Origin\\" („ÄåÂãøÂøòÂàùË°∑„Äç). The banner in Kowloon was never located by firefighters.  December 28, 2014 Devil's Peak  A 20-meter yellow banner with a new phrase \\"Hong Kong Add Oil\\" („ÄåÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÂä†Ê≤π„Äç) in Chinese characters was found on Devil's Peak in Lei Yue Mun (Yuan Tong) area. = 2015 =  June 23, 2015 Hong Kong - Macau Ferry Terminal in Sheung Wan  Not all vertical protest banners are political; some could be personal. A man climbed up to the top of the pedestrian bridge connecting the Terminal with Shun Tak Centre and dropped a white banner with black and red fonts. The wordings were blurred by the news agency possibly due to profanity, as the man accused a Macau company and real estate developer of fraud.  September 28, 2015 Lion Rock  On this one- year anniversary of the Umbrella Movement Hong Kong woke up to another yellow hill-top banner that reads \\"Dare Not Forget Our Origin\\" („ÄåÊØãÂøòÂàùË°∑„Äç). The Chinese character in this banner that translated to \\"not\\" was a different Chinese character used in the December 15, 2014 banner. = 2016 =  March 19, 2016 Hong Kong West Kowloon Rail Terminal  With the high-speed rail project going on for the 6th year and billions of dollars overbudget and years of delay, anti-high-speed rail activists climbed up to a crane located at the terminal construction site. The two green banners stated \\"Reject Single Checkpoint For Two Regions\\" („ÄåÂèç‰∏ÄÂú∞ÂÖ©Ê™¢„Äç) and \\"Stop Rail Construction\\" („ÄåÂÅúÂª∫È´òÈêµ„Äç).  May 17, 2016 Beacon Hill, Tseung Kwan O, Tsing Yi, and Lantau Island  Zhang Dejiang was the first Beijing figure visiting Hong Kong since the conclusion of the Umbrella Movement. The three-day visit was greeted by heavy police presence and at least four vertical banners reflecting Hong Kong citizens' demands of China. A smaller yellow-with-black-font banner was unfurled from a residential unit in Tseung Kwan O that read \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç). Although there were reports of police camping out overnight to prevent the incident, nevertheless a bigger vertical banner, also yellow with black font, was hung from Beacon Hill, the steep hill next to Lion Rock. The group League of Social Democrats (LSD) claimed responsibility for this banner that read \\"We Demand True Universal Suffrage\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç), calling it a \\"souvenir\\" for Zhang. As the day continued, LSD put out a second vertical protest banner near the Hong Kong International Airport as a \\"welcome\\" sign to Zhang. This banner is black with white fonts, and it stated \\"End Chinese Communist Tyranny\\" („ÄåÁµêÊùü‰∏≠ÂÖ±Â∞àÊîø„Äç ). As the official caravan continued its way into the city, a black vertical banner \\"Retract August 31 Decision\\" („ÄåÊí§ÂõûÂÖ´‰∏â‰∏ÄÊ±∫ÂÆö„Äç) and a \\"Universal Suffrage for China\\" („ÄåÂÖ®ÂúãËêΩÂØ¶ÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç) banner were seen flying along the Tsing-Ma Bridge.  June 3, 2016 Beacon Hill  Ahead of the annual 1989 June 4 Tienanmen Square Massacre vigil the pro-democracy political party League of Social Democrats once again erected a vertical protest banner calling Hong Kong citizens to remember those who died fighting for democracy under Communist China regime. The banner was white with black font, and the words showed \\"June 4 Never Forget. See You In Victoria Park\\" („ÄåÊØãÂøòÂÖ≠ÂõõÁ∂≠ÂúíË¶ã„Äç).  July 13, 2016 Hong Kong Shue Yan University (HKSYU)  As graduating high school seniors began applying for university admission, Hong Kong Shue Yan University was found to have multiple blue vertical protest banners hanging on building and lampposts around campus urging students to not apply to this substandard university. The red letters read \\"Shue Yan Life Regret\\" („ÄåÂÖ•Ê®π‰ªÅÊÇîÁµÇÁîü„Äç).  September 28, 2016 Devil‚Äôs Peak in Lei Yue Mun  On the second anniversary of the Umbrella Movement, League of Social Democrats put up a 6-meter \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç) banner at Devil's Peak in Lei Yue Mun.  October 1, 2016 all university campuses in Hong Kong  October 1 is China's National Day, which is also a holiday for celebrations and traditionally no students were on school grounds. However, in a move seen as defiance against China nationalism, a red fabric demanding \\"Hong Kong Independence\\" („ÄåÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÁç®Á´ã„Äç)in white font appeared in every single university and college in Hong Kong. The banners were in both Chinese and English. It was reported that a total of 15 higher education campuses saw these banners, some even had a second matching banner with \\"Hong Kong National Party\\" („ÄåÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÊ∞ëÊóèÈª®„Äç), presumably claiming responsibility of the move. Universities were quick to remove the banners, and no action was taken against those who erected the banners. Two years later, slightly before 2018's national holiday, Hong Kong National Party was banned by Hong Kong government citing national security threat.  November 24, 2016 Lingnan University in Tuen Mun  Before graduation Lingnan University students protested how students had no say in any university affairs, and how the Chief Executive of Hong Kong had access and power so matter-of-factly. The students demanded that the University terminate the current school board governor and remove chief executive as chancellor. They also demanded more student participation and voice. The banner was black with white font and was hung at the main atrium of campus. The eight Chinese words stated: \\"University Self-Governing Must Be Matter-Of-Fact\\" („ÄåÂ§ßÂ≠∏Ëá™Ê≤ªÔºåÂ§©Á∂ìÂú∞Áæ©„Äç). = 2017 =  July 1, 2017 Causeway Bay  Even as universal suffrage was not realized after the Umbrella Movement, Hong Kong pro-democracy fighters were not deterred to voice their opposition to the Chinese government. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping had just left Hong Kong after a 3-day visit, and within hours Hong Kong citizens took to the street to begin their annual July 1 mass protest again Chinese suppression. Where China silenced dissidents and even imprisoned them, Hong Kong has always been a free place to protest, as guaranteed by the Basic Law. However, the number of participants seemed to be the lowest among past rallies, and participants witnessed a pro-democracy journey split between the young and the old. Where the young Hong Kongers carried vertical protest banners demanding self-determination and Hong Kong independence, and older generation demanded the release of Chinese pro-democracy activist and 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. Since his participation in the 1989 June Fourth Tienanmen Square Massacre, Liu has been threatened and repeatedly imprisoned by the Chinese authorities since 1991. A vertical protest banner was carried along the July 1st march with Liu's face painted in color and the words \\"Immediately Free Liu Xiao Bo\\" („ÄåÁ´ãÂç≥ÈáãÊîæÂäâÊõâÊ≥¢„Äç). 13 days later, on July 13, 2017, Liu passed away in prison.  August 20, 2017 Wan Chai  Thousands took to the streets today to stand in solidarity of the three young pro- democracy activists jailed for their involvement in the Umbrella Movement 3 years prior. The three young activists were Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow. A yellow vertical banner was carried horizontally in the protest march that stated \\"You Make Me Fearless\\" („Äå‰Ω†ÂÄë‰ª§ÊàëÁÑ°Êáº„Äç).https://www.para- site.art/conferences/2017-para-site-international-conference-and-workshops- for-emerging-professionals/  December 30, 2017 Lion Peak  From around this time on the usual \\"We Demand True Universal Suffrage\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç) was no longer used, as if the protesters have given up on the demand after years of fighting. More than a year has past since the last hill-top banner was unfurled. This 2017 30-meter yellow vertical protest banner had a new slogan: \\"Safeguard Hong Kong\\" („ÄåÂÆàË≠∑È¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç), written in black font.  December 31, 2017 Beacon Hill  Immediately following the day prior, another \\"Safeguard Hong Kong Rally on January First\\" („ÄåÂÆàË≠∑È¶ôÊ∏ØÂÖÉÊó¶ÈÅäË°å„Äç) was hung on Beacon Hill. The New Year Day marches have been a Hong Kong fixture since 2010, when a Beijing politician lay out the Basic Law guaranteed Hong Kong universal suffrage of chief executive election in 2017 and Legislative Council election in 2020. However, empty Beijing promises were not realized and Hong Kong people continued to take to the streets, and take to the hills, to show their discontent. = 2018 =  February 5, 2018 Wan Chai  This black-with- white-font vertical protest banner was put up by Demosisto, a pro-democracy group with which three legislative council election candidates were disqualified by the Hong Kong government. The banner stated: \\"Refuse DQ, Return Voting Rights\\" („Äå‰∏çË¶Å DQÔºåÈÇÑÊàëÈÅ∏ËàâÊ¨ä„Äç).  February 11, 2018 Central  In this protest march various newly emerged Hong Kong localist groups called for Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheung to step down. This black-with- white-font vertical banner demanded \\"Cheng Yeuk-wah Step Down\\" („ÄåÈÑ≠Ëã•È©ä‰∏ãÂè∞„Äç). Reasons to call for her resignation included her interference with Legislative Council Election that ended with multiple young pro-democracy candidates being disqualified, and the alleged illegal constructions and additions to various properties under her name.  March 8, 2018 Beacon Hill  In response to the disqualification of legislative council election candidates a make-up election was about to take place on March 11. Pro-democracy political group League of Social Democrats put out this yellow banner with black font calling Hong Kong voters to \\"Reject DQ, Let's Vote\\" („ÄåÂèçDQÈΩäÊäïÁ•®„Äç).  May 31, 2018 Pui Ching Middle School, Kowloon City  While Pui Ching School official told newspapers that they has been hanging this banner for the last 10 years, nobody seemed to be paying much attention until now. Student council has always received approval from the school authorities before hanging up the banner. The banner was printed on black fabric with white painted Chinese characters that showed \\"Dare Not Forget June Fourth\\" („ÄåÊØãÂøòÂÖ≠Âõõ„Äç). The school continued to explain that if the banner stated \\"Redress June Fourth\\" („ÄåÂπ≥ÂèçÂÖ≠Âõõ„Äç) then the school might consider rejecting the approval as this became a political slogan demanding actions.  September 29, 2018 Beacon Hill  On the fourth anniversary of the Umbrella Movement a commemorative banner was found hanging on Beacon Hill. This smaller banner, about eight meters long, stated \\"Against Article 23\\" („ÄåÂèç23Ê¢ù„Äç), the national security law.  2019-20 Hong Kong Protests  The hill-top vertical protest banners have become more creative and the message more dire as the anti-extradition bill protests became more intense and violent. As days became months, the frequency of banner appearances also increased dramatically within the second half of 2019 as protests continued. However, due to COVID and pandemic lock-down, the first half of 2020 saw few banner activities, until the establishment of the national security law on July 1st. In addition, the wordings on these vertical protest banners have also evolved. No longer did the Hong Kong protesters hang up \\"We Demand True Universal Suffrage\\" („ÄåÊàëË¶ÅÁúüÊôÆÈÅ∏„Äç). In fact, this demand became one of five demands Hong Kong government was asked to address. Protest anthem \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" became the next banner and new protest slogan \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\" dominated the year's banner content. Lastly, police brutality were increasingly called out by these banners, a sign that reflected the increasing violent and bloody clashes between Hong Kong citizens and the police. = June =  June 4, 2019 Beacon Hill  Hong Kong is one of a few places that still commemorate those who died in the Tienanmen Square conflict. On this 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tienanmen Square Massacre, someone put a yellow \\"Dare Not Forget June Fourth\\" („ÄåÊØãÂøòÂÖ≠Âõõ„Äç) banner over Beacon Hill.  June 5, 2019 Devil's Peak  The day after the \\"Never Forget June Fourth\\" banner, yet another 15-meter banner was erected over Devil's Peak. This banner stated in Chinese \\"Lam Sold Hong Kong; Resign!\\" („ÄåÊûóÈÑ≠Ë≥£Ê∏Ø‰∏ãÂè∞ÔºÅ„Äç) in black font over yellow fabric.

June 7, 2019 Various Universities  Five universities in Hong Kong jointly displayed various vertical and horizontal protest banners to protest the extradition bill. Hong Kong City University (CityU) was a vertical protest banner in black that read \\"CityU Against Extradition To China\\" („ÄåÂüéÂ§ß‰∫∫ÂèçÈÄÅ‰∏≠„Äç).  June 9, 2019 Wan Chai  Vertical protest banners showing support along mass rally's route on June 9, 2019.This mass protest against the anti- extradition bill marked the beginning of a series of struggle in the next years to come. Almost over one million in attendance marching for 3 km from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Admiralty. The banners found in Wan Chai were hung from windows of residential flats. The three banners used sophisticated Chinese literary techniques to call for a stronger fight for freedom. From left to right, they can be roughly translated as \\"Those Who Sell Hong Kong To Extradition Will Not End Well\\" („ÄåÈÄÅ‰∏≠Ê∏ØË≥äÊ∏ØÁµÇÈÄÅ„Äç), \\"Against Extradition, Oppose Evil Law; Every One's Responsibility\\" („ÄåÂèçÈÄÅ‰∏≠ÊäóÊÉ°Ê≥ï‰∫∫‰∫∫ÊúâË≤¨„Äç), and \\"Defend Our Freedom to Not Live In Fear\\" („ÄåÊççË°õÂÖçÊñºÊÅêÊáºÁöÑËá™Áî±„Äç).  June 15, 2019 Lion Rock  A new phrase on a 30-meter vertical banner was seen on Lion Rock at around 6 am. The fabric was yellow, but this time a few of the words were printed red. The banner demanded \\"Safeguard Hong Kong\\" („Äå‰øùË°ûÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç) in Chinese, with the word \\"safeguard\\" in red, followed by an English phrase \\"Fight for HK\\" with the word \\"fight\\" in red.  June 16, 2019 Wan Chai  Two contrasting vertical protest banners carried by hundreds of protesters on June 16, 2019 Many vertical protest banners were carried along this two-million mass rally on June 16, 2019. The record-breaking two million protesters marching along Wan Chai would see these two black vertical protest banners with white fonts calling Hong Kong citizens to \\"No Retreat, No Disperse! No Surrender! Condemn June 12 Police Violence\\" („Äå‰∏çÊí§‰∏çÊï£ÔºÅ‰∏çÂ¶•ÂçîÔºÅË≠¥Ë≤¨612Êö¥ÂäõÈéÆÂ£ìÔºÅ„Äç). Other vertical protest banners seen in this rally included a two sets of couplets. One stated \\"Lam And Pro-China Camp Ruins Hong Kong; Dads and Moms Together Resist\\" („ÄåÊûóÈÑ≠Âª∫Âà∂‰∫ÇÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç„ÄåÁà∏Áà∏Â™ΩÂ™ΩÈΩäÂèçÊäó„Äç) and the other \\"Mourning In Pain; Withdraw The Diabolical Bill\\" ((„ÄåÁóõÂøÉÁñæÈ¶ñ„Äç) „ÄåÊí§ÂõûÊÉ°Ê≥ï„Äç ).  June 18, 2019 New Town Plaza in Sha Tin and Central  In Sha tin, this black fabric with white font vertical protest banner was written in ancient literary Chinese phrase that roughly stated \\"Why Threaten The People With Death When the People Do Not Fear Death\\" („ÄåÊ∞ë‰∏çÁïèÊ≠ªÂ•à‰Ωï‰ª•Ê≠ªÊáº‰πã„Äç). At night, a mass protest march saw almost one million marchers on the streets demanding the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Four black vertical protest banners appeared in this protest with white, hand-written Chinese characters, were couplets. They read: \\"Law and Order: No Extradition. Protests And Demonstrations Are Not Riots\\" („ÄåË™ìÂÆàÊ≥ïÊ≤ªÂèçÈÄÅ‰∏≠ Á§∫Â®ÅÊäóË≠∞ÈùûÊö¥Âãï„Äç) and \\"Shame on Police Brutality, Immediately Release the Arrested\\" („ÄåË≠¶ÂØüÊö¥ÂäõÊø´Ê¨äÂèØÊÅ• Âç≥ÊôÇÈáãÊîæË¢´Êçï‰∫∫Â£´„Äç).  June 26, 2019 Police Headquarter in Wan Chai  The white \\"Release All Activists\\" („ÄåÈáãÊîæÁæ©Â£´„Äç) was noticeably more last-minute than most other vertical protest banners. The banner was hung at around midnight as protesters stormed to Police Headquarter demanding the release of protesters unjustly detained or arrested. = July =  July 1, 2019 Legislative Council, Admiralty and Devil's Peak  The defining moment of the 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill protest inside Legislative Council building on July 1, 2019 Hanging vertical protest banners indoor has not been frequently attempted in the past few years as fewer people would see the words and their message. The storming of the Legislative Council was one of the key incidents that set the course of the 2019 protests. The four black vertical protest banners were the same ones used on the mass rally on June 18: \\"Law and Order: No Extradition. Protests And Demonstrations Are Not Riots\\" („ÄåË™ìÂÆàÊ≥ïÊ≤ªÂèçÈÄÅ‰∏≠ Á§∫Â®ÅÊäóË≠∞ÈùûÊö¥Âãï„Äç) and \\"Shame on Police Brutality, Immediately Release the Arrested\\" („ÄåË≠¶ÂØüÊö¥ÂäõÊø´Ê¨äÂèØÊÅ•Âç≥ÊôÇÈáãÊîæË¢´Êçï‰∫∫Â£´„Äç). Earlier in the day, Devil's Peak saw a white vertical protest banner with words roughly translated into \\"Mourning in Pain\\" („ÄåÁóõÂøÉÁñæÈ¶ñ„Äç).  July 13‚Äì14, 2019 Sha Tin  In addition to hanging vertical protest banners on hills and outside of buildings, Hong Kong protesters also use boats to showcase their vertical protest message horizontally moving along the river. A group called \\"Shatin Commons\\" claimed responsibility for hiring a boat on Shing Mun River to showcase their white-font-on-black fabric demanding the government to \\"Withdraw The Bill\\" („ÄåÊí§ÂõûÊÉ°Ê≥ï„Äç). The following day, Sha Tin residents organized a protest carrying two black-and-white contrasting banners: the white banner with black words stated \\"Mourning In Pain\\"(„ÄåÁóõÂøÉÁñæÈ¶ñ„Äç) and the black banner with white words demanded \\"Withdraw The Diabolical Bill\\" („ÄåÊí§ÂõûÊÉ°Ê≥ï„Äç ).

Defend the Law. Safeguard The Truth\\" („ÄåÁç®Á´ãË™øÊü•„ÄÅÊççË°õÊ≥ïÂà∂„ÄÅÂÆàË≠∑ÁúüÁõ∏„Äç). = August =  August 1‚Äì5, 2019 Sha Tin  Similar vertical protest banners were seen earlier in a June mass protest. These were hung inside a plaza in Sha Tin on August 5, 2019 Trying to increase participation of the general strike on August 5, Sha Tin residents unfurled a series of vertical protest banners throughout the week inside New Town Plaza. On August 1, two giant black and white fabric banners were hung from the second floor. The white banner with black words stated \\"Mourning In Pain\\"(„ÄåÁóõÂøÉÁñæÈ¶ñ„Äç) and the black banner with white words demanded \\"Withdraw The Diabolical Bill\\" („ÄåÊí§ÂõûÊÉ°Ê≥ï„Äç ).

Thousands took to the streets in various parts of Hong Kong as they called in sick for work. Hundreds of protesters also trekked into the Hong Kong International airport. Together, hundreds of flights were cancelled, and traffic throughout Hong Kong was paralyzed.  August 9‚Äì11, 2019 Hong Kong Airport  \\"Fly With You\\", also known as \\"Occupy Airport\\", on August 10, 2019, aimed to raise international awareness of Hong Kong's pro-democracy fight. A closer look at the vertical protest banner and its surrounding \\"Lennon Wall\\" border, hung in Hong Kong International Airport on August 11, 2019. The \\"Occupy Airport\\" tactic drew thousands of Hong Kong citizens to the Hong Kong International Airport in the midst of summer travel season. The vertical protest banner seen here appeared to be the \\"upgraded\\" version of the same one hung over Admiralty five days ago, showing \\"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\\" („ÄåÂÖâÂæ©È¶ôÊ∏ØÔºåÊôÇ‰ª£Èù©ÂëΩ„Äç) with a colorful post-it-memos backed \\"Lennon Wall\\" border.

The poetic literary technique made meaning translation difficult, but they roughly meant \\"Knowledge Comes From Freedom, Tolerance Unites St. Paul\\" („ÄåÂæóËá™Áî±Âæ™Áü•Ë≠òË∑Ø„ÄÅÂÆπÂ∑ÆÁï∞Áπ´‰øùÁæÖÂøÉ„Äç).  September 12, 2019 Beacon Hill  The protesters in these clashes were often in black bloc, so a common term was developed by the pro-government camp: \\"Black Rioters\\". Contrarily, pro-democracy activists called the riot police as \\"Black Cops\\", a term signified the actual black color police riot gear and, metaphorically, police brutality. This banner attempted to reverse the government narrative. Made out of black color fabric, this 30-meter long banner showed the phrase \\"The Rioters Are None Other Than The Black Cops\\" („ÄåÈªëË≠¶ÊâçÊòØÊö¥Âæí„Äç).

September 21, 2019 Beacon Hill  Another \\"The Rioters Are None Other Than The Black Cops\\" („ÄåÈªëË≠¶ÊâçÊòØÊö¥Âæí„Äç) banner, but this one was printed on yellow fabric, unlike the one two weeks ago on September 12, and was written in blank font.  September 22, 2019 Times Square in Causeway Bay and New Town Plaza in Sha Tin  While they look relatively small against Lion Rock as their backdrop, these vertical protest banners could actually be quite gigantic when placed indoor. Today in Times Square of Causeway Bay protesters unfurled from the 4th floor a over-size banner demanded \\"We Long for Glory to Hong Kong\\" („ÄåÊàëÈ°òÊ¶ÆÂÖâÊ≠∏È¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç). Unlike outdoor banners that always ended up being confiscated by the firefighters or the police, protesters today were able to recoil the banner and took it with them. Earlier in the day at Sha Tin, two yellow banners with black fonts were erected inside New Town Plaza. The banners read \\" Truth Be Told. Vow to Eliminate MTR\\" („ÄåÈÇÑÊàëÁúüÁõ∏ÔºåË™ìÊªÖÈª®Èêµ„Äç) referring to the earlier Prince Edward MTR Station police attack on August 31.

First confirmation of COVID spreading in Hong Kong was January 23. As the city re-emerged from quarantines, and as China and Hong Kong government continued to use this \\"quiet time\\" to pushed through their national security agenda, Hong Kongers responded with more hill-top vertical protest banners.  January 18, 2020 Beacon Hill  This black-with-white- font banner was about 25 meters long. The Chinese characters showed \\"Hong Kongers Add Oil; Resist and Avenge\\" („ÄåÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø‰∫∫Âä†Ê≤πÂèçÊäóÂæ©‰ªá„Äç).  May 28, 2020 Beacon Hill  This banner was the first one written entirely in English.

May 29, 2020 Devil's Peak  This was the second day of the passing of the national security law. This banner was about 30 meters long, and the Chinese characters roughly translated into \\"Chi-national Security Law Obliterate Hong Kong\\" („ÄåËùàÂÆâÊ≥ïÊëßÊØÄÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç). The word play on this banner also illustrated the deep mistrust in and disgust of China by Hong Kong people. On this banner, the original Chinese character for \\"national\\" (Âúã) was replaced by a more demeaning homophone, made worse by the simplified Chinese character, Ëùà, that represented a type of insect such as crickets and locusts in the Orthoptera order.

June 14/15, 2020 Beacon Hill  The looming national security law and the pandemic have both resulted in a gradual decline in street protests. However, hill-top vertical protest banners continued to appear unexpectedly. Seen in the early morning, a 25-meter black- with-white font \\"One Country One System Hong Kong Game Over\\" („Äå‰∏ÄÂúã‰∏ÄÂà∂È¶ôÊ∏ØÁé©ÂÆå„Äç) was found hung in Beacon Hill.  June 17, 2020 Beacon Hill  A 30-meter black-with-white font banner written in English only \\"HK Can't Breathe\\" was found on Beacon Hill. This phrase alluded to the death of George Floyd in the United State that caused a months-long protest against police brutality in the US.  June 22/23, 2020 Lion Rock  Another 30 meter black-with-white- font but this time it called Hong Kong citizens to \\"Fight Against Diabolical Law: Head To the Street On July 1\\" („Äå‰∏É‰∏Ä‰∏äË°óÊäóÊÉ°Ê≥ï„Äç).  June 30, 2020 IFC in Central  On the eve of the Beijing-enacted national security law taking into effect, this is the third time Hong Kong citizens saw this vertical banner and this time it was erected in International Finance Center (IFC) in Central.

Post-National Security Law  Since the establishment of the controversial Hong Kong national security law Hong Kong citizens seen a drastic decline in protest frequency and scale. Hill-top vertical protest banners also came to a halt as citizens continued to reassess the risk now penalized by imprisonment, possibly for life. More and more pro- democracy activists have fled the city, and more and more protesters, some times even law makers, previously arrested were now charged with rioting pending trial. = July 1, 2020 Causeway Bay and Wan Chai = First vertical protest banner since the enactment of the national security law on July 1, 2020Even though the police denied the July 1st mass rally application for the first time since 2003, over 100,000 Hong Kong citizens took to the streets in Causeway Bay and Wan Chai to voice their dissatisfaction of the national security law and of the decline of Hong Kong's freedom and increased censorship. This banner was the second one that contained profanity: \\"We Really Fucking Love Hong Kong\\" („ÄåÊàëÂìãÁúü‰øÇÂ•ΩÊíöÈçæÊÑèÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç). This banner was a call to the citizens amid national security law fear, to remember that these protests all originated from the love for Hong Kong. Many pro-democracy art work spawned from this banner thereafter. = September 21, 2020 Devil's Peak = This banner was a response to Hong Kong government's decision to postpone the much anticipated Legislative Council election for a year. The 20-meter banner was printed on black fabric with white fonts, and it demanded the government to \\"Initiate Legislative Council Election Now\\" („ÄåÁ´ãÂç≥ÂïüÂãïÈÅ∏Ëàâ„Äç). = September 26, 2020 Shau Kei Wan = With 2020's mid-autumn festival coincides with China's National Day on October 1, unhappy Hong Kong activists erected a 20-meter long black-with-white-font vertical banner calling citizens to \\"Celebrate His Mom On October 1st\\" („ÄåÂçÅ.‰∏Ä.Ë≥Ä‰Ω¢ËÄÅÊØç„Äç). The was the second year this profane phrase appeared on the hills of Hong Kong, albeit at a different hill top. However common and colloquial, this phrase explicitly showed anger towards China and Hong Kong's unwillingness to surrender. Last year on October 1, a local Hong Kong group called \\"G20\\" successfully bought full-page advertisements in nine different countries' newspapers using the same phrase \\"Celebrate His Mom On October 1st\\". The group, founded before 2019 G20 Osaka Summit, had three goals: to pay tributes to freedom fighters slaughtered and suppressed by Communist China's 70 years of ruling, to bring awareness of the Hong Kong resistance against China to the world, and to invite the world to stand against China. The countries included South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Argentina, and Mexico. = October 7, 2020 Kowloon Peak = see also \\"2020 detainment of Hong Kong residents at sea by China\\" On the 45th day of the capture and detainment of 12 Hong Kong residents at sea by the Chinese coastguards, a black-with-white-font vertical protest banner showed up around midnight on Kowloon Peak.

It is in the Franklin Ward of Auckland Council. History At the time of European settlement, Ararimu was densely covered with native trees. A dispute over rights to take kauri gum was settled in 1857 in favour of NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua. The land was taken by the government under the New Zealand Settlements Act of 1863 and divided into blocks of about . Lots were auctioned in 1867, and three pioneers made purchases: J Dunn, Laughlan Keaney and John Markham. These three families remained in Ararimu for many decades, with the last descendents of the Dunn family leaving in 1985. In 1871, residents petitioned for roads to improve access to their farms. ¬£100 was allocated to the building of a road between Ararimu and Maketu (Ramarama) at the end of 1873. and the road was built using volunteer labour the following year. Demographics The statistical area of Ararimu, which at 91 square kilometres is much larger than the locality, had a population of 2,124 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 288 people (15.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 435 people (25.8%) since the 2006 census.

The church is broadly dated to the Middle Ages, but the exact time of its construction is unknown.  Description  The church stands in the center of the village. It is a hall-church design, its walls built of large coarsely processed blocks of local volcanic rock. There is the only entrance, leading into a hall with a small vault leaning against arches. The arches are constructed of the porous volcanic rock. According to local reports, the villagers have found iron crosses and fragments of millstones in the debris of the church. The local Georgian Svan community revered the church as a shrine of St. George. The church was partially restored and continued to be used until 2008, when the local population had to leave the area during the Russo-Georgian War. There is a second church on the northeast outskirts of the village. At an altitude of about 1600 m above sea level, it is the most highland place of warship on the territory of Abkhazia. Its design is akin to the former church, but it is larger in size. Local limestone volcanic rock is used in its walls and ceiling blocks.

The Sukhumi Cathedral of the Annunciation is an Eastern Orthodox church in the city of Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia, an entity in the South Caucasus with a disputed political status. The cathedral was built in a Neo-Byzantine fashion by Sukhumi's then-vibrant Greek community between 1909 and 1915. It was then consecrated in the name of St. Nicholas and was, therefore, popularly referred to as Greek Nicholas Church. In the 1940s, after the expulsion of most of local Greeks by the Soviet government under Joseph Stalin, the church passed to the Georgian Orthodox Church as a replacement for its former diocesan cathedral church demolished by the Soviet authorities about a decade earlier. It was reconsecrated in the name of Annunciation and remained one of the few functioning churches on the territory of autonomous Abkhazia throughout the Soviet period. In the 1980s, the church was significantly refurbished and its premises expanded under the Georgian Orthodox metropolitan bishop David Chkadua. As a result of the War in Abkhazia (1992‚Äì1993) and expulsion of ethnic Georgian clergy from Abkhazia, the church was left to the guidance of ethnically Abkhaz priest of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Vissarion Apliaa, who made some renovation on the church building with the help of the Russian church authorities in 2011. Apliaa declared severance of ties with the Georgian church and began to style himself as the leader of independent Abkhazian Orthodox Church, although the former remains canonically unrecognized within the Orthodox world and the Abkhaz Orthodox clerical community itself straddles division. In 2011, the de facto Abkhaz government transferred 38 churches, cathedrals and monasteries perpetually into the care of the Abkhazian Orthodox Church. From the point of the Georgian government, the church is part of cultural heritage located in the Occupied Territories of Georgia.

History After Bollinger Motors was founded in 2014, a prototype announcing the company's first production electric off-road vehicle was unveiled in September 2017. The B1 Concept took the form of a three-door vehicle with an angular silhouette and matt paint. The B1 was presented in September 2019, adopting cosmetic changes to the appearance of the lights, the radiator grille and, above all, the dimensions of the body compared to the study from two years ago. The vehicle became longer, gaining not a 3-door, but a 5-door body with an additional second row of seats. Another characteristic element of the B1's appearance is the raw, angular body maintained in a minimalist design, which has also been preserved in the passenger compartment. A breakthrough solution was the development of a compartment for transporting long items from the edge of the front to the rear lane thanks to placing the electrical system longitudinally under the passenger compartment and widely spaced seats. B2 Simultaneously with the premiere of the serial B1, Bollinger also presented a pickup based on it, called Bollinger B2. It was distinguished by an extended wheelbase with a large transport compartment adjacent to the four-door, four- seat passenger cabin. Sale Production of serial Bollinger models is expected to begin at the end of 2020, while sales of B1 and B2 are expected to start in early 2021 with prices starting at $125,000. Technical data Both the B1 and the B2 are powered by two electric motors with a total power of 614 HP, developing 905 Nm of torque. Battery capacity is 120 kWh, while the projected range is set at .

Elizabeth Thursby, widow, buried in the church by alderman Robert Aylmer, her late husband, gave 10 marks towards finishing the church, and her best gilt chalice.  Family  Children of Robert Aylmer and Elizabeth: *Richard (d. 3rd day before the Ides of September, i.e. 11 September 1512) * Thomas (d.1500), buried in London, according to his mother's will, though he desires to be buried in Norwich in his, and there is a plaque in the church to that effect * Cecile/Cecily, dead before 1518, when her mother writes in her will that she wishes for prayers to be said for the souls of my children 'Richard Thomas and Cecyly' * Elizabeth (d. 15 September 1493) After his death his widow Elizabeth was involved in a suit with Sir William Knyvett. At some point after this suit, Elizabeth remarried. First to John Aylmer, also called Mayor of Norwich in the north isle window which commemorates Elizabeth and her three husbands. Then, by 1500, when her son refers to her as Elizabeth Thursby in his will, to Thomas Thursby (d.1510), merchant, and three times Mayor of King's Lynn and the founder and benefactor of Thoresby College, and possibly had the daughters Margaret, the wife of Francis Mountford (1474/76‚Äì1536) of the Inner Temple, London and Feltwell, Norfolk, Beatrice, who married firstly William Trew (d.1510/12) of Lynn and secondly William Coningsby (by 1483‚Äì1540) of the Inner Temple, London and Lynn, Norfolk, and Elizabeth, the wife of Thomas Gibbon (Guybon) (1470/71‚Äì1531), of West Lynn, Norfolk, Ellen and Margery. Elizabeth, the widow of Robert Aylmer, is possibly the 16-great- grandmother of Prince Williiam, Duke of Cambridge, through her daughter or otherwise her step-daughter Elizabeth Thursby. Thomas Thursby was married several times, so there is some uncertainty as to who the mother of his children was. If the birth date given for his son of the same name, 1587, is correct, this son cannot possibly be the son of Elizabeth, as she was still the wife of Robert Aylmer (d.1493) then. However, Elizabeth's son Richard's daughter Cecily mentions ' my aunte Thorysby' in her will, leaving her a spoon of silver, indicating that at least one of Thomas Thursby's children was by Elizabeth. She also mentions her 'sister' Grenall, which must be Margery Thursby, married name Grindell. Richard Aylmer writes of 'my brother ffrannces mountford', the husband of Thomas Thursby's daughter Margaret, in his will.

About who the young man depicts, analysts assume it could be someone from the Medici family, as Lorenzo de' Medici was one his main benefactors. The work has been painted with tempera on wood and has the dimensions of 58.7 cm in height and 38.9 cm in width.  History  The painting was first mentioned in 1938, when it was in possession of Baron Newborough of Caernavorn. At the time the art dealer Frank Sabin visited the Newborough estate and reckoned the painting in a fore-room. As the painting did not seem to have been valued adequately by Lord Newborough, Sabin managed to buy the piece for a small amount. It is assumed by the art community that the painting came into the possession of the Newborough family when the 1st Baron Newborough, Thomas Winn, lived in Florence, Italy between 1782 and 1791. Frank Sabin sold the portrait to the collector Sir Thomas Merton in 1941 for a five- figure sum. It is in his possession that the portrait was first described as a piece of Botticelli and his descendants sold it in 1982 through an auction at Christie's for 810'000¬£. During its possession in the Merton family the portrait has become the subject of the poster for the Exhibition of Italian Art of the British Royal Academy of Art in 1960. After the owner changed at the auction by Christie's in 1982, the portrait was given on loan to major Museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, United States, the National Gallery in London, England or to the St√§del Museum in Frankfurt where it was displayed in a Botticelli exhibition in 2009‚Äì2010. The attribution of the portrait to Sandro Botticelli, has been disputed by various analysts in the past. But today the majority of the art community doesn't doubt that it is a Botticelli. In September 2020, it was known that the portrait is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in January 2021.

Instead of patrolling the entire 3000 km plus border, troops would just be required to patrol to the patrolling points. Over time, as infrastructure, resources and troop capability improved and increased, the patrolling points were revised. The concept of patrol points came about well before India officially accepted the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Patrolling points give a truer on‚Äìground guide of India's limits of actual control.

In 1993 the government had accepted the concept. The concept of patrolling points were set up well before India officially accepted the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In the 1970s, when resources were severely constricted, the PPs were set up to make optimum use of resources. Over time, as the infrastructure improved, the PPs have been revised. Most PPs are close to the LAC, however in Depsang plains area, the PPs still remain well inside, despite having been revised a number of times. Former Army officers have said that PPs are a better on ground picture of India's limits of control. Based on location, the periodicity of visiting PPs can vary greatly from a few weeks to a couple of months. While some PPs are numbered, others are not, and are identified by geographical landmarks. There are over 65 PPs stretching from Karakoram to Chumar. PPs within the LAC and the patrol routes that join them are known as 'limits of patrolling'.

The new Children's Hospital of Illinois opened in August 2010, with a new Level I pediatric and a Level III neonatal intensive care unit (the only one in Central Illinois) and emergency room. The Milestone Project was the largest expansion in the hospital's history adding 440,000 square feet and costing $280 million. In 2011, the hospital expanded their congenital heart program merging with local clinics. The hospital made national and international headlines in the healthcare field on April 9, 2013, when a toddler, Hannah Warren, about 3, from South Korea (born to a Canadian father and South Korean mother) who was born without a trachea (a windpipe) received an artificial trachea that incorporated, with the plastic, her own living stem cells (the adult type), in the first bioengineered transplant on a child in the U.S. and the first bioengineered trachea transplant in the world. It is the first stem cell procedure of any kind at the Catholic medical center. The major 11-hour surgical procedure was led by Dr. Paolo Macchiarini of Sweden's's Karolinska Institute, along with top surgical and medical officials from OSF. However, she died three months later from complications.  About  Right down the road from the Children's Hospital of Illinois is the newly opened Ronald McDonald House of Central Illinois, Peoria. The new building has 22 rooms for families of patients of children in the hospital ages 21 and under. The hospital also has a American Academy of Pediatrics verified level 3 NICU, the highest in the state. = Patient Care Units = CHOI features all private rooms, with sleeping accommodations for parents. The hospital has a few patient care units for pediatric care. Each floor containing a pediatric unit also contains a playroom and a teen room for entertainment. * 40-bed General Pediatrics - General Inpatient Care * 32-bed Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PCCU) - Care For Critical Pediatric Patients * 40-bed Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) - Intensive Care For Neonates * 32-bed Neonatal Intermediate Care Unit - Care For Newborns Not Critical = Rankings = In 2017-18, the hospital ranked #29 in pediatric urology and #49 in neonatology on the U.S. News and World Report: Best Children's Hospitals rankings. In 2018-19, CHOI dropped two places and placed #31 in pediatric urology on the U.S. News and World Report. In 2020-21 the hospital ranked nationally in Pediatric Nephrology on the U.S. News and World Report: Best Children's Hospitals, and the 4th best children's hospital in Illinois after Lurie Children's, Comer Children's, and Advocate Children's.

The site, known as a dargah, was originally constructed , though many additions and alterations were made to its structures over the following centuries. It became a religious centre in the region, respected across multiple ruling administrations and greatly venerated among Bengalis, with local folklore and legends developing around it. The extensive surrounding compound serves several functions and includes four mosques, a religious school and a public cemetery among others. The Dargah is presently the largest and most visited religious site in Bangladesh. Religious significance Shah Jalal was a Sufi saint traditionally accredited with the Muslim conquest of Sylhet as well as the propagation of Islam in the region. Described by Syed Murtaza Ali as \\"the patron saint of Sylhet\\", following his death in 1347, Shah Jalal's burial place in the city became an object of veneration. Both Bengali Muslims and Hindus perform pilgrimages to the site to make offerings and prayers to the saint. The annual urs, a Sufi death anniversary festival, attracts thousands of visitors, mainly from Bangladesh and neighbouring India. The Dargah is presently the most visited shrine in Bangladesh, with historian Syed Mahmudul Hasan calling it \\"the religious centre of Sylhet\\". History It is said that following the conquest, Shah Jalal settled on top of the hillock where the Dargah now sits with some of his companions. The Sultan of Lakhnauti, Shamsuddin Firuz Shah, requested the saint, as a reward, rule over the newly acquired Qasbah of Srihat (Sylhet). However, the latter refused to accept this offer and instead appointed Sikandar Khan Ghazi as the first wazir of the region. Firuz Shah, wanting to somehow reward Shah Jalal, then announced that he will honour the saint by making his residence tax-free. This exemption for the site has continued to the present-day. The original shrine was constructed during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah of Bengal according to a 1505 inscription at the site, though earlier religious buildings had previously existed there. Among these were a large mosque from the reign of Sultan Shamsuddin Yusuf Shah built by a Dastur (minister) named Majlis in 1472, as well as potential buried pre-Islamic ruins, though the latter remains unexcavated. After the region came under Mughal rule, many of the governing Faujdars of Sylhet commissioned construction projects at the site, which included mosques and tombs. Though many have since disappeared, notable among what remains are a three-domed mosque by Bahram Khan, the surrounding wall of the Dargah by Lutfullah Shirazi and the Bara Gumbad mosque by Farhad Khan. It was also under Farhad Khan's tenure that, in 1678, the current shrine was constructed. No presently existing building dates from beyond the 17th century, with subsequent construction tending to only renovate the older structures. According to old records, when the courtiers of Delhi would visit the town, the Shaykh of the Dargah would ceremonially tie a pagri on their heads. The locals would not accept the high status of the courtiers until they payed their respects to Shah Jalal. This was also a tradition among Sylhet's Muslim rulers who, as an act of reverence, visited the Dargah upon their first arrival at the city. Under the British, this custom was continued by the Residents of Sylhet. Robert Lindsay, appointed to that role in 1779, gives the following account of his visit: Layout and structures Shah Jalal's open- roofed grave Located on a low hillock (known as the Dargah Tila) in the Dargah Mahalla neighbourhood of north Sylhet, the mausoleum complex is the largest religious compound in Bangladesh. The main entrance, known as the Dargah Gate, opens into a large plaza, ahead of which lies a section dedicated to services for women. Shah Jalal's burial place itself lies in the centre of the compound and is reached via a flight of stairs to the right of this section, though only men are permitted to enter. The steps terminate at a broad flat platform, in front of which is the Bara Gumbad mosque, through which visitors pass to access the tomb. The latter is masonry constructed and open-roofed, with its four corners marked by large tapering pillars which support a cloth canopy, with the grave itself being considered notable for its unusually large size. The burial places of some of Shah Jalal's companions, such as Shahzada Ali, Haji Yusuf, Haji Khalil and Haji Daria, as well as his Chilla Khana, are located nearby. The saint's talwars, Quran, robes, wooden kharam, deerskin- prayer rug, copper plates and Arabic-enscribed bowls and cups are also preserved. As well as containing a madrasa and a khanqah, on the opposite side of the plaza to the tomb is a large Langar Khana (kitchen) to serve the many poor who visit the Dargah and originally made to be a shelter for visitors. This is now closed due to environmental reasons and so there is a small hut built to its east which serves this purpose. Located in the Langar Khana are three brass degs (cauldrons), the largest being 5 feet in height. Each of these cauldrons can simultaneously cook 7 cows and 7 maunds of rice. On their edges are Persian inscriptions that mentions that they were made by Shaykh Abu Sa'id ibn Muhammad Zafar ibn Yar Muhammad of Jahangirnagar and sent by Murad Bakhsh to the Dargah in Ramadan 1106 AH (April/May 1695 CE). An extensive graveyard occupies the area behind the tomb, with it being a popular desire among Muslims to be buried near Shah Jalal's remains, though the lots are very expensive. Also present are a Jalsa-house, established during the Mughal period, and an elevated domed clock-tower to its south. To the tomb's west, at the foot of the hillock, is a natural well named Chashma which stands within a spacious brick enclosure. According to legend, Shah Jalal himself ordered its digging, and its sacred water, which is drank by visiting pilgrims, is the same as that of the Zamzam Well in Mecca. Legends also exist regarding the catfish and great snakeheads (known as gozar) that inhabit the shrine's tank reservoir, which are commonly fed by visitors. They are said to be the defeated soldiers of Gour Govinda, cursed by Shah Jalal to be eternally reborn in this form. Alternatively, they have also been claimed to be descendants of fish which had been bred by the saint. In December 2003, an unidentified group poisoned and killed over 700 of the fish. In response, the following month, 24 gozar were brought from the shrine of Shah Jalal's companion, Shah Mustafa, in the neighbouring Moulvibazar District and released into the Dargah reservoir. Presently, the population has once more risen to the hundreds. Local folklore further states that the Blue Rock Pigeons seen in and around the Dargah (known as Jalali Kabutar or 'Jalal's pigeons') are descended from a pair gifted to the saint by Nizamuddin Auliya. =Mosques= A total of four mosques currently exist around the Dargah, with the Bara Gumbad being the biggest of these as well as the largest structure in the compound in general. Constructed in 1677 by Farhad Khan, its original purpose is uncertain, though historian Ahmad Hasan Dani suggested that it may have been intended as a tomb. Its single dome rests on an octagonal drum and is topped with a pinnacle and surrounded by corner towers, also octagonal, though the latter are stunted due to their tops having disappeared. The structure has three framed entrances on its eastern side, with the middle being the largest, and a small niche between them. The parapet is of a blended Mughal and Bengali style and the interior is simple, though the underside of the dome is decorated. To the south of the Bara Gumbad is Bahram Khan's three-domed structure, commissioned in 1744, which serves as the primary mosque of the compound. Each of its domes has tall finials and rest on crenelated drums. Like the Bara Gumbad, its eastern side has three arched doors, the middle also larger, as well as a modern veranda. The mosque was damaged during the 1897 Assam earthquake, requiring repairs by the Magistrate of Sylhet, John Willes. A smaller mosque stands on the western side of Shah Jalal's grave and forms a part of the enclosure. Three-domed and likely originally also constructed by Farhad Khan, it was rebuilt in the same design and style in the late-18th century by the then Collector of Sylhet. A fourth mosque, erected by Abdullah Shirazi, lies on the eastern bank of the tank reservoir. Notable burials The grave of M.A.G.

Before Akbar, he had also served under Humayun and later commanded Mughal army to the eastern Uttar Pradesh region in battle against the rebel Afghans. Ali Quli later rebelled, supported by his Uzbeg kinsmen. His rebellion distracted the Mughal Empire for two years till 1567. Career Ali Quli Khan had kinship ties with other leading Uzbeg nobles of the Akbar who enjoyed powerful position and prestige during the time of Humayun as well. These included Bahadur Khan, Sikandar Khan, Iskandar Khan and Abdullah Khan. These nobles served the Mughal Empire in their own capacity in various regions. Ali Quli primarily proved himself as a distinguished commander by waging wars against the Afghans of the Jaunpur region. He along with his Kinsmen controlled the regions like Banaras, Awadh and Jaunpur. When Abdullah Khan, the governor of Malwa rebelled and on being pursued by Akbar fled to Gujarat, Akbar developed a prejudice against the Uzbeg nobles. Illustration from Akbarnama showing victory of Ali Quli Khan on Afghans at Gomti, 1561 Akbar was also skeptical of the Khan Zaman's conduct, who fell in love with the son of a Camel rider whom he called \\"My Padshah\\" and bowed down to him. Being aware of the Akbar's stand regarding Uzbegs and influenced by the tribal sense of independence that was prevalent in Afghans, Ali Quli decided to declare independence from Mughals. In the meantime he also developed friendship with Afghan ruler of Bengal, Sulaiman Karrani. He recruited an army of 30,000 which contained Hindustanis, Afghans and Uzbegs in a bid to pursue his ambitions. Rebellion against Mughals Ali Quli was joined by other disgruntled Uzbeg nobles who felt that they were not rewarded as per the service they did for the Mughals. In 1565 when Akbar ordered one of the Uzbeg noble called Iskandar Khan to appear before him at his court, the alarmed Uzbegs under Ali Quli Khan raised the banner of open rebellion. The rebels attacked Kannauj and Kara into two separate groups. In order to contain the rebellion, Akbar took diplomatic step to isolate the rebels. The letter was sent to ruler of Orrisa, who was in war of attrition with the Bengal for a long time and since Bengal was supporting Uzbegs, this step was taken to put a pressure upon the Sultan of Bengal. Jaunpur was made the headquarter of Mughal forces and message was sent to commander of Rohtas fort to assist Mughal forces. Akbar also commanded his nobles to built houses in the Jaunpur to undertake a long run campaign against the rebels until they are crushed. In 1566; after a two-year campaign, Akbar was able to control them but given the friendship of Munim Khan, Akbar's wakil with the Uzbegs they were pardoned and their Jagir were also returned by Akbar, who was persuaded by Munim Khan to do so. In the meantime, Akbar was distracted by the activities of his half brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim, the ruler of Kabul, who after being ousted by Sulaiman Mirza was trying to foment dissatisfaction in the Punjab region against Akbar. The Uzbegs now declared Mirza Hakim as their emperor and started reading his name in Khutba with issuance of coinage in his name. This made Akbar rush quickly to contain them for the second time after chasing Mirza Hakim out of Punjab. The attempt of the Uzbegs under Ali Quli Khan to create dissatisfaction in the empire resulted in loss of Akbar's trust upon them. Death In 1567, Akbar defeated the Uzbegs near Kara and Khan Zaman was killed during the battle while his kinsmen Bahadur Khan was captured and executed.

Previous names are Rupicola gnidioides and Budawangia gnidioides.  Taxonomy  The species was first formally described as Rupicola gnidioides by Victor Summerhayes in 1927. In 1992, it was separated from Rupicola into a new monotypic genus Budawangia by Ian Telford. In 2015, Budawangia and Rupicola were merged into the larger genus Epacris, with the new binomial combination attributed to Elizabeth Anne Brown. \\"Epacris gnidioides (Summerh.) E.A.Br.\\" is an accepted name for the Australian Plant Census (APC).  Description  [Unless otherwise noted, descriptions below are adapted from Telford 1992.] Plants of this species are found in cliff habitats and are adapted to rocky environments. They are rhizomatous with naked stems that grow along cracks in the rock-face. Emergent stems are decumbent to erect, up to 40 cm long. Leaves are small (5‚Äì8 mm long), narrow (1‚Äì2 mm wide), and lanceolate, with three longitudinal veins and short petioles. The stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs. Small, white flowers are produced in the southern spring from September to December. Like other epacrids, the flowers are carried singly in the leaf axils near the ends of the stems. The lobes of the corolla are longer than the tube. Filaments of the stamens are longer than the anthers, which are outside the mouth of the corolla. Flowers and fruit are 5-lobed. The fruit is a capsule that splits along the locules to release the seeds.  Distribution  Limited to the northern Budawang Ranges, south-west of Nowra, most known populations are within Morton National Park.

It served the hamlet of Oio, which lay to the north of the station. It was north of Raurimu and south of ≈åwhango. It was one of the many temporary railheads along the route, with work going on from 1904 to 1908. The Public Works Department transferred the station to NZ Railways on 9 November 1908, though a road had been built in 1904, by March 1905 a station yard was being formed and by April 1906 it was the railhead, with a pumice road to Makatote. By then trains were bringing ballast, platelaying was in progressand the track stretched half way to Raurimu, having been realigned due to a slip and crossing an embankment into a cutting, which was being cut. An unnamed stream, then called the Waikohatu River, was to be bridged and pile-driving was in progress for a bridge over Piopiotea Stream, the bridge girders being made in Auckland by Fraser and Co. The bridge has since been replaced in concrete. By 10 May 1907 goods could reach Raurimu by rail. Oio in 1905, when it was the terminus of the line from Auckland By 20 March 1908 Oio had a passing loop for 58 wagons, a x passenger platform, a x shelter shed, with lobby and store, a tablet office, a loading bank, cattle yards and pens, a x goods shed with verandah, privies, urinals and a water tank of supplying water by gravity. A 6th class station and cart approach to the platform were added by 10 November 1908. Houses for railway workers were built between 1908 and 1926, the population of Oio being 102 by 1916. Oio was one of 3 stations with the shortest (three-letter) names in New Zealand, along with Ava in Wellington and Tui in the Nelson Region. The name may be a contraction of ioio (muscular), or puioio (a tree knot). Oio closed to passengers on 5 July 1970 and to freight on 28 August 1972.  Manson's Siding  Manson & Clark put in a siding, south of Oio, between 1915 and 1917 to serve their timber mill, which had a tramway running to the north west. The mill, described as United Sawmills in 1932, burnt down in 1937 and the siding closed on 3 April 1949. The name remains as a road and a locality. = Incidents = A train was stuck in a washout a mile south of Oio in 1933. Trains were delayed by a washout at Mansons Siding in 1940. A goods train was partly derailed in a cutting near Mansons Siding in heavy rain in 1941. A 1945 washout injured 2 passengers and derailed 6 coaches of the Night Limited, just north of Mansons Siding. RM 30 collided with a velocipede between Raurimu and Oio on 28 January 1982. On 7 August 1991, after striking a washout near Mansons Siding, driver Graeme Peter Orange died and EF class locomotives 30036 and 30088 were later scrapped. A memorial was placed there and in 2017 a train stopped at the washout site in tribute.

It is the latest escalation of the unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict over the region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but mostly governed by Artsakh, a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority. Clashes began on the morning of 27 September 2020 along the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, which had been established in the aftermath of the Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988‚Äì1994). In response to the clashes, Armenia and Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilization, while Azerbaijan introduced martial law and a curfew. On 28 September, partial mobilization was declared in Azerbaijan. The conflict has been marked by the deployment of drones, sensors, long-range heavy artillery and ballistic missile strikes, as well as by state propaganda and the use of official social media accounts in online information warfare. Numerous countries and the United Nations strongly condemned the conflict and called on both sides to deescalate tensions and resume meaningful negotiations without delay. Turkey is providing military support to Azerbaijan, although the extent of its support is disputed. International analysts believe that fighting likely began with an Azerbaijani offensive, and that primary goals of the offensive were to reclaim districts in southern Nagorno-Karabakh that are less mountainous and thus easier to take than the region's well-fortified interior. Turkey's support for Azerbaijan is thought to be an attempt to extend its sphere of influence both by increasing the standing of Azerbaijan in the conflict and by marginalizing Russia's influence over the region. A fragile humanitarian ceasefire brokered by Russia, facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and agreed to by both Armenia and Azerbaijan, formally came into effect on 10 October. The ceasefire has been repeatedly violated, halting a planned return of the dead and exchange of wounded and prisoners. Total casualties on both sides may be approaching the low thousands, and due to Russian‚ÄìTurkish geopolitical dynamics and pipeline politics there are concerns regarding a wider regional conflict.  Background  Azerbaijani SSR in 1928, including the Nagorno- Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. The clashes are part of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, with its ethnic Armenian majority. The region is a de jure part of Azerbaijan, but is de facto held by the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh, which is supported by Armenia. Ethnic violence began in the late 1980s, and exploded into a full war following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The Nagorno-Karabakh War resulted in the displacement of 750,000 Azerbaijanis and 353,000 Armenians from both Azerbaijan and Armenia. The War ended with a ceasefire in 1994, with the Republic of Artsakh controlling most of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, as well as the surrounding districts of Agdam, Jabrayil, Fuzuli, Kalbajar, Qubadli, Lachin and Zangilan of Azerbaijan. For three decades, multiple violations of the ceasefire have occurred, the most serious incidents prior to the current conflict being the 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes. Long-standing international mediation attempts to create a peace process were initiated by the OSCE Minsk Group in 1994, with the interrupted Madrid Principles being the most recent iteration. While it is unclear how the present inhabitants of the area want to administer the territory, surveys indicate that they do not want to be part of Azerbaijan. In August 2019, in an unprecedented declaration in favour of unification, the Armenian Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan, visited Nagorno-Karabakh, stating, \\"Artsakh is Armenia, full stop\\". Skirmishes occurred on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan in July 2020. Thousands of Azerbaijanis demonstrated for war against Armenia in response, with Turkey propagandising in support of Azerbaijan. On 23 July 2020, Armenia announced the start of a joint air defence system exercise with Russia and an analysis of the July 2020 clashes. A week later, Azerbaijan conducted a series of military exercises that lasted from 29 July to 10 August, and further exercises in early September with the involvement of Turkey. Azerbaijan and Turkey are bound by strong ethnic, cultural and historic ties, and refer to their relationship as being one between \\"two states, one nation\\"; Turkey helped Azerbaijan gain its independence from the Russian Empire back in 1918, and become the first county to recognize Azerbaijan's independence from the Soviet Union back in 1991. Turkey is also the guarantor of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic since 1921, which is an exclave of Azerbaijan. Despite that, others have seen Turkey's support for Azerbaijan as connected to its expansionist foreign policy, linking its intervention to its policies in Syria, Iraq, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's high visibility role in the conflict has complicated it by raising the matter of the 1.5 million Armenians who died in the deportations, forced marches, and massacres its Ottoman predecessors initiated in 1915. Prior to the resumption of hostilities, allegations emerged that hundreds of Syrian National Army members from the Hamza Division were transferred to Azerbaijan, while Turkish media close to President Erdogan claimed that YPG and PKK members from Iraq and Syria were transferred to Nagorno-Karabakh in order to train Armenian militias against Azerbaijan. The governments of both Azerbaijan and Armenia have denied allegations of involvement by foreign fighters.  Course of the conflict  The conflict began with an Azerbaijani ground offensive that included armored formations, supported by artillery and drones, including loitering munitions. Armenian and Artsakh troops were forced back from their first line of defense in Artsakh's southeast and northern regions, but inflicted significant losses on Azerbaijani armored formations with anti-tank guided missiles and artillery, destroying dozens of vehicles. Azerbaijan made heavy use of drones in strikes against Armenian air defenses, taking out 13 short-range surface- to-air missile systems. Azerbaijani troops managed to make limited gains in the south in the first three days of the conflict. For the next three days, both sides largely exchanged fire from fixed positions. In the north, Armenian/Artsakh forces counterattacked, managing to retake some ground. Their largest counterattack took place on the fourth day, but incurred heavy losses when their armor and artillery units were exposed to Azerbaijani attack drones, loitering munitions, and reconnaissance drones spotting for Azerbaijani artillery as they maneuvered in the open. On the sixth day, Azerbaijan and Armenia began trading missile and rocket artillery strikes against infrastructure. Among the targets hit were Stepanakert, the capital of Artsakh, which was repeatedly shelled with rocket artillery, a bridge linking Armenia with Nagorno-Karabakh, which was taken out in a missile strike, and Ganja, which was hit four times by Armenian and Artsakh ballistic missiles, with Ganja International Airport among the targets. On the morning of the seventh day, Azerbaijan launched a major offensive. The Azerbaijani Army's First, Second, and Third Army Corps, reinforced by reservists from the Fourth Army Corps, began an advance in the north, making some territorial gains, but the Azerbaijani advance stalled. Most of the fighting subsequently shifted to the south, in terrain that is relatively flat and underpopulated as compared to the mountainous north. Azerbaijani forces launched offensives toward Jabrayil and F√ºzuli, managing to recapture a stretch of territory held by Armenian troops as a buffer zone, but the fighting subsequently stalled. Throughout the campaign, Azerbaijan has relied heavily on drones to strike at Armenian/Artsakh forces, and managed to inflict heavy losses. Having successfully targeted tanks, artillery, and air defense systems, Azerbaijani drones are now targeting units of soldiers. However, some Azerbaijani drones have been shot down.https://www.latimes.com/world- nation/story/2020-10-15/drones-complicates-war-armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno- karabakh On 9 October, both sides agreed to a temporary humanitarian ceasefire. After the declared ceasefire, the President of Artsakh admitted Azerbaijan had been able to achieve some success, moving the front deep into Artsakh territory; the Armenian Prime Minister announced that Armenian forces had conducted a \\"partial retreat\\". =Timeline of military engagements= This timeline of engagements relies primarily on official statements from belligerents. The engagements have been characterized by the use of trench warfare, heavy artillery, armoured warfare, rocket attacks, and drone warfare, especially the use of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 and Israeli loitering munition Harop drones, as well as by the use of cluster munitions (which are banned by most of the international community but not by Armenia or Azerbaijan). A series of ballistic missile attacks inflicted mass civilian casualties in Ganja, Azerbaijan, while civilian infrastructure in Stepanakert, Artsakh's capital, and elsewhere in the zone has been targeted, causing extensive damage and inflicting casualties. The amount of territory contested is relatively restricted, but the conflict has expanded beyond the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh due to the kind of munitions deployed and spilled over international borders. Shells and rockets have landed in East Azerbaijan Province in Iran, though causing no damage, and Iran have reported that several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been downed or crashed within Iran, while Georgia stated that two UAVs had crashed in Kakheti Province. After the shelling of Martuni, Artsakh authorities began mobilizing civilians.  27 September  alt= According to Artsakh authorities, hostilities commenced when at 08:03 Azerbaijani armed forces launched artillery and aerial strikes against civilian settlements, including the capital, Stepanakert. The Armenian Ministry of Defence (MoD) stated that the Azerbaijani offensive, aimed at Stepanakert, began at 08:10 local time (04:10 GMT). Azerbaijani authorities stated that at about 06:00 local time, Armenian armed forces started intensive shelling of Azerbaijani army positions along the entire front and of nearby Azerbaijani settlements. Azerbaijan thus stated that it launched a counteroffensive. In the offensive, Azerbaijan stated it deployed manpower, tank and rocket artillery units, aircraft and UAVs. The Republic of Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilization of its male population, while the Azerbaijani President addressed the nation. In the afternoon, Azerbaijan announced martial law and a curfew. The Azerbaijani military deployed tanks, artillery, missile systems and aircraft near the front and entered deeper into Nagorno-Karabakh. According to the Armenian MoD, in the morning Azerbaijani armed forces also attacked in the direction of Vardenis in Armenia proper. The Azerbaijani MoD stated it had taken seven villages in Nagorno-Karabakh. At 16:29, Azerbaijan issued a surrender ultimatum to the Armenian command in the zone, while affirming its compliance with international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions. In the afternoon, the Azerbaijani MoD stated it had taken a mountain peak in the Murovdag range. The Ministry also stated that its forces had taken effective control of the Vardenis‚ÄìMartakert/Aghdara highway connecting Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia; these claims were questioned.  28 September  At around 08:00, the Azerbaijani MoD stated that Armenian forces had fired upon Tartar in the early morning and issued a warning in response, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) stated that Armenian forces had purposefully targeted civilian sites and civilians. The President of Artsakh stated that during the morning's clashes, Armenian forces had regained control over a number of previously ceded positions. At approximately 10:00, the Azerbaijani MoD claimed that Azerbaijani forces had gained strategic high ground around Talƒ±≈ü while Armenian forces had incurred heavy losses. The President of Artsakh stated that Azerbaijani forces were facing Armenian attacks on all fronts. Shortly after, the Azerbaijani MoD stated that Azerbaijani forces had fired on Armenian artillery units that had been targeting Azerbaijani-controlled settlements in the area of Aghdara; it added Armenian units had incurred losses from artillery fire and withdrew. At around 19:00, the Azerbaijani MoD stated that Armenian forces had fired upon Yuxarƒ± Aƒücak…ônd and Qaramusalƒ± in Goranboy District. At approximately 20:00, Artsakh authorities stated that Armenian forces had retaken some positions, adding that Armenian forces had repelled Azerbaijani attacks and advanced into Azerbaijani territory. Subsequently, at approximately 21:00, an Armenian MoD-related source, Artsrun Hovhannisyan, stated that Azerbaijani forces had launched a new major offensive operation in the Aras Valley and in the direction of Madagiz‚ÄìTalƒ±≈ü. Around one hour later, Poghosyan claimed that an Azerbaijani airplane had been shot down near Khojavend; Azerbaijan issued a denial. The Azerbaijani MoD denied allegations that Azerbaijan had deployed F-16s, denying it owned any.  29 September  At around 08:00, the Azerbaijani MoD stated that intensified clashes had continued along the front overnight; it added it had repelled an Armenian counterattack. Concurrently, Azerbaijani aerial and ground forces allegedly destroyed a mixed column of Armenian military vehicles travelling from Madagiz in the direction of Aghdara, together with an artillery battery. At approximately 09:00, the Ministry stated that from 07:30, Azerbaijan's Dashkasan District had been shelled from Vardenis, in Armenia; the Armenian MoFA issued a denial, claiming this was a fabrication to justify expanding the theater of operations, including against Armenia. Azerbaijani authorities reiterated its claim of Armenian aggression. The Azerbaijani MoD then stated that its offensive on Fuzuli City continued from the early morning. Subsequently, it denied Armenian claims to have retaken territory. At around 11:00, the Armenian MoD stated that Azerbaijani forces had fired on the Armenian military base in Vardenis, within Armenia, also deploying its air force. The Azerbaijani MoD claimed to have destroyed an Armenian motorized rifle regiment stationed in Khojavend District; the ADA issued a denial. Azerbaijan stated it had destroyed an Armenian Uragan multiple rocket launcher in Khojavend District. Subsequently, an Armenian source claimed to have repelled further Azerbaijani attacks. At around 12:00, one Azerbaijani gunship was claimed to have been downed; the Azerbaijani MoD issued a denial, claiming it had not been deploying helicopters. At approximately 12:40, ADA units claimed to have downed two helicopters using Igla man-portable surface-to-air missiles; Artsakh released footage apparently showing this. An Armenian source then stated that Azerbaijani forces were bombarding areas near Vardenis. The Azerbaijani MoD stated it had destroyed an Armenian command-and-observation post in Hadrut in Khojavend District, while the Armenian MoD announced it would be deploying heavier weapons and was repelling Azerbaijani offensives. The Azerbaijani MoD stated that an Armenian attempt to assault Azerbaijani-controlled military positions from A≈üaƒüƒ± Veys…ôlli in Fuzuli District had been repelled, with Armenian losses. At approximately 13:20, the Armenian MoD stated that the Azerbaijani military had launched an offensive. Around two hours later, the Azerbaijani MoD claimed that S-300 missile systems defending Yerevan's airspace were being redeployed towards Nagorno-Karabakh and would be targeted. Shortly after, the ADA released footage apparently showing Armenian forces downing an Azerbaijani gunship. At around 18:00, the Artsakh MoD stated that Azerbaijani forces had attacked along the northern and north-eastern directions of the front, while the ADA had inflicted losses. Shortly after, the Armenian MoD stated that a Turkish F-16, taking off from Ganja International Airport had downed an Armenian Su-25, killing the pilot. Both Azerbaijani and Turkish authorities issued denials; the Armenian MoD released images of a wrecked Su-25. According to Azerbaijan, two Su-25 jets took off on Armenian territory and later crashed into a mountain. At around 22:00, the Armenian MoD stated an Azerbaijani ammunition convoy had been destroyed. Approximately one hour later, the Azerbaijani MoD stated its forces had destroyed an Armenian position near H…ôs…ônqaya in Tartar District and another in the direction of Talƒ±≈ü.  30 September  According to the Armenian MoD, the clashes continued with lesser intensity overnight. At approximately 08:30, the Azerbaijani MoD stated that Armenian forces had been shelling Tartar City. At approximately 10:20, the Azerbaijani MoD stated that its units had surrounded Armenian forces with the aid of artillery fire, and that clashes continued in the Aghdara/Martakert‚ÄìTartar area of the front. At approximately 10:20, the Ministry stated that Armenian forces had started firing upon A≈üaƒüƒ± Aƒücak…ônd, in Goranboy District. At approximately 11:10, the Armenian MoD stated that the Azerbaijani Air Force was attacking Armenian positions in the northern direction of the front. At approximately 12:25, the Azerbaijani MoD stated that the Armenian 7th Mountain Rifle Regiment of the 10th Mountain Rifle Division, stationed in Tona≈üen, had incurred heavy losses and retreated; it released footage apparently showing the attack and stated that Azerbaijani forces attacked the command post of tan Armenian regiment of the 18th Motorized Division, inflicting casualties. The Armenian MoD stated that Armenian forces had destroyed a substantial quantity of Azerbaijani materiel, including a TOS-1A.

Military  Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Vice-president Mehriban Aliyeva during a meeting with the wounded Azerbaijani servicemen. Since the beginning of the clashes the government of Azerbaijan has not revealed the number of its military casualties. However, Armenian and Artsakh authorities have claimed 6,309 Azerbaijani soldiers and Syrian mercenaries were killed.

Over the course of 2 October, the Artsakh Defence Army claimed the destruction of 39 Azerbaijani military vehicles, including a T-90 tank; four SU-25 fighter-bombers; three Mi-24 attack helicopters; and 17 UAVs.  Analysis  Azerbaijan likely initiated the conflict; its military is better prepared and it intends to retake de jure Azerbaijani territory. Complex geopolitics involving Russia and Turkey have come into play. Drone warfare and propaganda have featured prominently, and hatred and stereotypes are driving the conflict. While Azerbaijan's intended goals were likely strategically limited, concerns exist that direct confrontations between Armenia and Azerbaijan could result in an all-out, devastating multi-front war that could spread beyond the region; a strategic pipeline with major Western investment transports Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea crude oil to Turkey and then on to Western markets. = Azerbaijan's intended goals = In a 27 September interview, regional expert Thomas de Waal stated that it was highly unlikely that hostilities were initiated by the Armenian side as they were already in possession of the territory and were incentivized to normalize the status quo, while \\"for various reasons, Azerbaijan calculates that military action will win it something\\". One analyst in the journal Foreign Policy predicted that Azerbaijan would have great difficulty in trying to occupy the entire area of Nagorno-Karabakh due to the extremely inaccessible mountainous terrain controlled by Armenian troops. In addition, he opined that the readiness of the Azerbaijani army was very poor, with morale low, its structure corrupt and inefficient, and a desertion rate as high as 20 percent. Furthermore, despite large investments in the purchase of military equipment from oil profits, the Azerbaijani army was said to lack adequate training for the use of new equipment. The suspected immediate goal of the Azerbaijani attack was to capture the districts of Fuzuli and Jabrayil in southern Nagorno-Karabakh, where the terrain is less mountainous and more favorable for offensive operations. Russian military expert Mikhail Khodarenok stated that Azerbaijan had carefully planned and prepared the offensive operation; he added that the Azerbaijani army did not appear to complete its initial objectives during the first five days of the clashes, taking neither Fizuli nor Mardakert. Similarly, political scientist Arkady Dubnov, an expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center and for the Russia in Global Affairs magazine, believes that Azerbaijan launched the offensive to improve Azerbaijan's position in a suitable season for hostilities in the terrain. Russian political columnist Alexander Budberg stated that Azerbaijan was, in attempting to recover 20% of its territory, better prepared for the conflict and likely to advance slowly and carefully, with the possibility that the operation would be suspended if pressure on Baku became too intense. = Status of respective militaries = Azerbaijan has consistently spent more on its military budget than Armenia, permitting it to purchase advanced weapons systems, mainly from Israel, Russia and Turkey. Azerbaijan has superior tanks, armored personnel carriers, and infantry fighting vehicles. It has built a large drone fleet with Turkish and Israeli-supplied state-of-the-art drones. The Armenian military and Artsakh forces mainly rely on older Soviet-era weapon systems. Armenia has its own indigenously-produced drones, but they are generally greatly inferior to the drones Azerbaijan possesses. Azerbaijan has a quantitative advantage in artillery systems, particularly self-propelled guns and long-range multiple rocket launchers. Armenia has a minor advantage in tactical ballistic missiles. Azerbaijan has a larger fleet of manned combat aircraft than Armenia, though both sides have so far largely refrained from using them. If both countries go to war, it would nonetheless be waged with Russian and Turkish-supplied 21st century heavy weapons, potentially causing more death and destruction than in the 1990s. = Turkey and Russia = Russia has maintained good relations with Azerbaijan and has sold weapons to both parties; however, Russia possesses a military base in Armenia as part of a military alliance with Armenia, and thus is obligated by treaty to defend Armenia in the case of a war. Like in Syria and in Libya's ongoing civil war, Russia and NATO-member Turkey therefore have opposing interests. Turkey, driven by President Erdogan's ambitions to improve his popularity and divert attention from his country's economic issues, appears to be using the conflict to attempt to leverage its influence in the South Caucasus along its eastern border, using both military and diplomatic resources to extend its sphere of influence in the Middle East, and to marginalize the influence of Russia, another regional power. Russia has historically pursued a policy of maintaining neutrality in the conflict, and Armenia has yet to request aid. According to the director of the Russia studies program at the CNA, Russia is unlikely to intervene militarily unless Armenia incurs drastic losses. However, the 14 October Azerbaijani strike within Armenian territory has threatened to bring the mutual defense pact to the fore. = Drone warfare = Azerbaijan has made highly effective use of drones, including the Bayraktar TB2, and sensors, in a \\"new, more affordable type of air power\\", indicating the future of warfare. Azerbaijani drones have been used to carry out precise strikes and as reconnaissance aircraft, relaying the coordinates of targets they spot to Azerbaijani artillery. It had previously been assumed that drones would not play a major role in conflicts between nations due to their vulnerability to anti-aircraft fire. While this might be true for major powers with air defences, it appears to be less true for smaller powers. The use of drones in this conflict has showcased their potential in enabling small countries that lack large fleets of manned aircraft to conduct effective air campaigns.https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cheap-drones-china-turkey- israel-are-fueling-conflicts-armenia-azerbaijan-ncna1243246 Close air support can be provided by specialized suicide drones, such as IAI Harop, rendering tanks vulnerable and suggesting changes are required to armored warfare doctrine. = Propaganda war = Both sides have engaged in extensive propaganda campaigns through the use of official mainstream and social media accounts magnified online, including in Russian media. The ability of drones to record their kills has enabled a highly effective Azerbaijani propaganda campaign. In Baku, digital billboards have broadcast high-resolution footage of missiles striking Armenian soldiers, tanks, and other materiel. Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev told Turkish television that Azerbaijani- operated drones had reduced the number of Azerbaijan's casualties, stating, ‚ÄúThese drones show Turkey's strength\\" and \\"empowers\\" Azerbaijanis. = Role of dehumanization = While Armenians and Azerbaijanis trained side by side under Soviet rule, the collapse of the Soviet Union contributed to racialization and fierce nationalism, causing both Armenians and Azerbaijanis to stereotype each other, shaping respective sociopolitical discourses. During and after the Nagorno-Karabakh War anti-Azerbaijani sentiment grew in Armenia, leading to harassment of Azerbaijanis there. The incitement of hatred against Armenians and promotion of hate speech is one of the main challenges of creating the necessary conditions to enhance the peace process, as well as to establish an atmosphere of confidence between the people of the conflicting sides.  Official statements  The Armenian ambassador to the United States Varuzhan Nersesyan has invited US intervention in the conflict, as has his Azerbaijani counterpart Elin Suleymanov. = Armenia and Artsakh = President of the National Assembly Ararat Mirzoyan (second from left) leads a moment of silence honoring Armenian soldiers and civilians who perished in the 2020 Nagorno- Karabakh conflict. On 27 September, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, accused the Azerbaijani authorities of a large-scale provocation. The Prime Minister stated that the \\"recent aggressive statements of the Azerbaijani leadership, large-scale joint military exercises with Turkey, as well as the rejection of OSCE proposals for monitoring\\" indicated that the aggression was pre-planned and constituted a major violation of regional peace and security. The next day, Armenia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) issued a statement, noting that the \\"people of Artsakh were at war with the Turkish‚ÄìAzerbaijani alliance\\". The same day, the Armenian Ambassador to Russia, Vardan Toganyan, did not rule out that Armenia may turn to Russia for fresh arms supplies. On 29 September, Prime Minister Pashinyan stated that Azerbaijan, with military support from Turkey, was expanding the theater into Armenian territory. On 30 September, Pashinyan stated that Armenia was considering officially recognizing the Republic of Artsakh as an independent territory.

Azerbaijan stated that the Armenian side attacked first, prompting an Azerbaijani counter-offensive. On 27 September, Azerbaijan accused Armenian forces of a \\"willful and deliberate\\" attack on the front line and of targeting civilian areas, alleging a \\"gross violation of international humanitarian law\\". On 28 September, it stated that Armenia's actions had destroyed the peace negotiations through an act of aggression, alleged that a war had been launched against Azerbaijan, mobilized the people of Azerbaijan, and declared a Great Patriotic War. It then stated that the deployment of the Armenian military in Nagorno-Karabakh constituted a threat to regional peace and accused Armenia of propagandising, adding that the Azerbaijani military was operating according to international law. The Azerbaijani authorities issued a statement accusing the Armenian military of purposefully targeting civilians, including women and children. The Azerbaijani Minister of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) denied any claims of Turkish involvement, while admitting military- technical cooperation with Turkey and other countries. On 29 September, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, spoke about Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Aliyev stated that the Armenian occupation and aggression had led to the destruction of infrastructure and mosques, caused the Khojaly massacre, and resulted in cultural genocide, insulting the Muslim world and being tantamount to state-backed Islamophobia and anti-Azerbaijani sentiment. Azerbaijani authorities issued a joint statement on alleged war crimes against civilians by Armenia. The Azerbaijani MoFA demanded that Armenia stop shelling civilians and called on international organizations to ensure Armenia followed international law. The Azerbaijani Ambassador to Russia denied reports of mercenaries brought in from Turkey by Azerbaijan, and the First Vice-President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Mehriban Aliyeva, stated that Azerbaijan had never laid claim to others' territory nor committed crimes against humanity. On 3 October, Aliyev stated that Armenia needed to leave Azerbaijan's territory (in Nagorno-Karabakh) for the war to stop. The next day, Aliyev issued an official statement that Azerbaijan was \\"writing a new history\\", describing Karabakh as an ancient Azerbaijani territory and longstanding home to Azerbaijanis, and noting that Armenians had occupied Azerbaijan's territory, destroying its religious and cultural heritage, for three decades. He added that Azerbaijan would restore its cities and destroyed mosques and accused Armenia of distorting history. Two days later, Azerbaijan stated that Armenia had deployed cluster munitions against cities. On 7 October, Azerbaijan officially notified members of the World Conference on Constitutional Justice, the Conference of European Constitutional Courts, the Association of Asian Constitutional Courts and similar organizations that it had launched the operation in line with international law to re-establish its internationally recognized territorial integrity and for the safety of its people. On 8 October, Aliyev accused the Armenian Armed Forces of committing war crimes through the firing of ballistic missiles at civilian settlements. He also accused Armenia of ethnic discrimination on account of the historical expulsion or self-exile of ethnic minority communities, highlighting its mono- ethnic population. On 10 October, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov stated that the truce signed on the same day was temporary. Despite this, Aliyev stated that both parties were now attempting to determine a political resolution to the conflict. The next day, Azerbaijani authorities stated that Armenia was conducting an act of genocide, emphasizing the Khojaly massacre.  Allegations of third-party involvement  Because of the geography, history, and sensitivities of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, accusations, allegations, and statements have been made of involvement by third-party and international actors, including in media reports and by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Evidence of the presence of Syrian fighters in Azerbaijan is increasing. = Turkey and Syrian National Army = Prior to the beginning of the conflict, Turkey's upped rhetoric against Armenia, as well as its recruitment of several hundred Syrian refugees had been reported the previous week by Syrian commentators, activists and others on social media, circulated among Syrian refugees, dissidents and others who monitor Syria. Detailed reporting on the evidence of Syrian fighters in Azerbaijan exists, as well as apparent Turkish military involvement, causing international concern. Two days into the conflict, several Syrian National Army (SNA) members and the SOHR alleged that a private Turkish security company was recruiting Syrians to fight in Artsakh; Azerbaijan and Turkey issued denials. A report in The Times partially confirmed Turkish involvement in sending 200 Syrian fighters to support Azerbaijani forces; a Turkish-based source reported that these were acting independently of the SNA. Emmanuel Macron accused Turkey of dispatching Syrian \\"jihadists\\" to Nagorno-Karabakh via Gaziantep while Russia expressed concern over \\"illegal armed units\\" from Syria and Libya being present in the conflict zone. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reiterated Macron's concerns. On 3 October, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan claimed that Syrian fighters, together with Turkish army specialists, were involved, along with circa 150 senior Turkish military officers, allegedly directing military operations. The National Security Service of Armenia presented intercepts, allegedly between the Turkish and Azerbaijani military, and between the Azerbaijani military and mercenaries. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that Turkey's involvement in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has increased the risk in the region, inflaming the situation by arming the Azerbaijanis. On 2 October, Russian investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported 700‚Äì1,000 militants had apparently been sent to Azerbaijan and detailed their transport and recruitment itinerary, referring to the Hamza Division and the Samarkand and Nureddin Zinki Brigades. The Georgian State Security Service stated news about the passage of Syrian fighters from Turkey through Georgia to Azerbaijan was disinformation. On 3 October, Elizabeth Tsurkov, an American expert on Syria, reported on videos of Arabic-speaking foreigners, who she identified as likely Syrian mercenaries in Horadiz, urging compatriots to join them.. Subsequently, Tsurkov detailed the recruitment, by the Hamza Division and Sultan Murad and Sultan Suleyman Shah Brigades, of at least a thousand mercenaries to Azerbaijan, including civilians with no fighting experience who had been informed they would be guarding oil facilities but were then sent to the front. On 5 October, Russian News Agency RIA Novosti stated that 322 Syrian mercenaries were in the conflict zone and that 93 had been killed, while 430 from Syria had already arrived. On 6 October, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service alleged that several thousand fighters from Middle East terrorist organizations had arrived in Nagorno- Karabakh to fight for Azerbaijan, specifically from Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaeda branch), Firkat Hamza, and the Sultan Murad Division, as well as extremist Kurdish groups, claiming all were linked to the Islamic State (ISIL). On 7 October, Asia Times reported that mercenaries allegedly signed up to go to Azerbaijan for US$1,500 a month. Kommersant states that during the first week of October up to 1300 Syrian militants and 150 Libyan mercenaries deployed to Azerbaijan. On 16 October, Kommersant provided details of Turkish military involvement. Turkish servicemen had apparently remained in Azerbaijan after joint military drills this summer, to coordinate and direct the planning and conducting of the operations. Six hundred servicemen had stayed on, including a tactical battalion of 200 people, 50 instructors in Nakhchivan, 90 military advisers in Baku, 120 flight personnel at the airbase in Qabala; 20 drone operators at Dollyar Air Base, 50 instructors at the aviabase in Yevlakh, 50 instructors in the 4th Army Corps in Perekeshkul and 20 others at the naval base and Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy in Baku. According to the source, forces included 18 Turkish infantry fighting vehicles, one multiple launch rocket system, 10 vehicles and up to 34 aircraft, including 6 warplanes, 8 helicopters and up to 20 military intelligence drones. On 17 October, the Armenian National Security Service stated that Azerbaijan is smuggling in a significant amount of ammunition, mercenaries and terrorists from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The SOHR confirmed a total of 320 Syrian fighters in Azerbaijan, primarily of Syrian-Turkmen descent from the Sultan Murad Division, and initially stated that they had not participated in the clashes. It stated that Arab-majority Syrian rebel groups had in fact refused to send their fighters to Azerbaijan. On 1 October 2020, the SOHR confirmed the deaths of 28 Syrian fighters and nearly 60 injured or missing. On 20 October, the SOHR stated that at least 161 pro-Turkey Syrian rebel fighters, who were among more than 2,050 combatants, had been killed in clashes. An unidentified SNA leader, the Jesr Press and a The Guardian article confirmed the deaths of dozens of Syrian fighters. On 14 October, The Washington Post reported the deaths in Karabakh of more than 50 Syrian mercenaries, most of them hired by Turkey. Prime Minister Pashinyan in an interview given to French newspaper Le Figaro claimed that 30 percent of those Azerbaijanis killed in hostilities were foreign mercenaries. Canada has suspended the export of its drone technology to Turkey over concerns that it is using the technology in the conflict. = Armenian diaspora fighters and Kurdish militias = Before the conflict, Turkish sources alleged that YPG and PKK members from Iraq and Syria were transferred to Nagorno-Karabakh in order to train Armenian militias against Azerbaijan, and on 30 September, Turkish sources alleged that approximately 300 PKK militants were transported to Nagorno-Karabakh via Iran. However, according to a Washington Post commentator, these claims may be doubted, due to Turkey having previously issued questionable statements regarding PKK and YPG activities. A Jerusalem Post commentator wrote that the Daily Sabahs suggestions of PKK/YPG involvement in Karabakh were designed to create a justification for Turkey to claim the PKK was threatening its 'security' so that it could invade, noting that Turkey had used this same excuse to attack northern Iraq and Syria. On 28 September, the Azerbaijani MoD alleged that among the Armenian casualties were mercenaries of Armenian origin from Syria and a variety of Middle East countries. On the same day, the Turkish Minister of Defence stated that Armenia must \\"send back the mercenaries and terrorists it brought from abroad\\". Two days later, Azerbaijani authorities asked the international community to \\"adequately respond to the use of terrorist forces by Armenia\\". The SOHR also stated that Armenian-born Syrian fighters were being transported to Armenia to fight against Azerbaijan. On 4 October, the Turkish MoD demanded that PKK-YPG \\"terrorists\\", allegedly cooperating with Armenians in targeting civilians, vacate the region. The next day, Azerbaijani authorities stated that Armenia had widely employed foreign terrorist forces and mercenaries against it, with there being evidence of people of Armenian origin from the Middle East, especially Syria and Lebanon, and subsequently Russia, Georgia, Greece, the United Arab Emirates, and other countries. A Novaya Gazeta report, citing Lebanese Ministry of Internal Affairs intelligence, stated around 500 lethnic Armenian Lebanese had travelled to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Azerbaijani MP Sabir Rustamkhanli alleged that Iran was engaged in transporting weapons from various countries to Armenia. Subsequently, in the Azerbaijani Parliament, Rustamkhanli suggested opening an Azerbaijani embassy in Israel. The Chief of Staff of the President of Iran, in a phone call with the Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan, denied the claims and stated that they were aimed at disrupting both countries' relations. Iranian state-affiliated media stated that trucks depicted in the footage consisted of shipments of Kamaz trucks that the Armenian government had previously purchased from Russia. Azerbaijan's president initially stated that Georgia had not allowed the transportation of weapons through its territory and thanked Georgia, as a partner and friend. However, in a subsequent interview, he alleged that Armenia was misusing one of its Il-76 cargo planes for civil flights, to secretly transport fighters and Kornet anti-tank missiles from Russia through Georgian airspace into Armenia.https://report.az/ru/nagorno-karabakhskiy-konflikt/aliev-iran-i- gruziya-zakryli-vozdushnoe-prostranstvo-i-nazemnye-dorogi-dlya-dostavki- oruzhiya-v-armeniyu/ Georgia responded by stating that its airspace was closed to all military and military cargo flights but not for civil and humanitarian ones.https://civil.ge/archives/375897  Serbia  Azerbaijan has claimed that Armenia is employing Serbian weapons, alleged to have been transported via Georgia. In response, the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, stated that Serbia considers both Armenia and Azerbaijan to be friends and \\"brotherly nations\\", insisting that Serbian weapons were not being used in Nagorno- Karabakh.  International reactions  = OSCE Minsk Group = On 2 October 2020, the OSCE Minsk Group, responsible for mediating the peace process in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict since 1992, condemned the fighting and called on those involved in the conflict to respect their obligations to protect civilians.

After its premiere with P.O.W., the United States Steel Hour was broadcast for 10 seasons from 1953 to 1963. The brainwashing and abuse of American prisoners of war during the Korean War was again dramatized in Prisoner of War (1954, starring Ronald Reagan), The Bamboo Prison (1954), and The Manchurian Candidate (1962, starring Frank Sinatra). Reception Television critic Leo Mishkin called it \\"TV drama of the first order, written with keen perception of character, and staged and acted with remarkable power.\\" In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Win Fanning called it \\"great drama\\" and wrote that the production \\"came closer\\" to meeting theatre's responsibilities of truth and dramatic integrity \\"than anything presented heretofore on the living room screen.\\" References External links * Category:American television films Category:American films Category:1953 television plays Category:Prisoner of war films ","title":"P.O.W.

Completed in the early 1610s, the painting is currently housed at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Painting The painting depicts de Momper's typical foreign, imaginary landscape. The colors become colder and the contours less distinct as they move to the background, where a valley crossed by a river sits. Looming out of the clouds, there is a barely distinct, bluish mountain peak. A hunter with several dogs and three horesmen are marching up a mountain road. To their right, two herdsmen tending to their cattle are sitting by a waterfall. The scene is fringed by the tall trees of a wooded slope to the left, and, to the right, by a crag whence the cascade is falling to the foreground. Jan Brueghel the Elder and Joos Momper collaborated on several occasions, with the latter always painting the landscape and the former often taking care of the staffage. In this instance, Brueghel painted the figures for de Momper. Provenance The painting was part of Catherine the Great's collection. The empress was a patron of the arts, literature, and education. The Hermitage Museum, which occupies the whole Winter Palace (once Catherine's residence), began as Catherine's personal collection. The empress was a lover of art and literature, and ordered the construction of the Hermitage in 1770 to house her expanding collection of sculpture, books, and painting, among which was the Rocky Landscape with a Waterfall. By 1790, the Hermitage was home to 38,000 books, 10,000 gems and 10,000 drawings.. As the painting was part of Catherine's collection, it may be claimed that it entered the Hermitage before 1797.

Background  Omugo refugee settlement was planned to host some 43,000 refugees as it was formed to accommodate the suppressing number of South Sudanese refugees after Imvepi refugee settlement quickly reached its capacity. It was formed on the 17th of August as a zonal extension of the Rhino camp Refugee settlement.  Social services  At Omugo refugee settlement, World Vision is entrusted to overseeing the overall functioning of the Reception Centre, on top of providing hot meals to all new arrivals of the South Sudanese into the availed space. World Vision is also extending its child protection programming to Omugo refugee settlement in order to provide comprehensive case management for unaccompanied and separated children plus children at risk at the heart of the camp. The Uganda #Football4Peace initiative to promote peaceful coexistence among the youth in Omugo Refugee Settlement has been established by the collaboration between AVSI Foundation and Onduparaka football club - a Football team based in Uganda\`s Arua District, to educate local communities and young people through sports. At a time when young refugee children need more space for social development and Peace Building, this initiative has come right in the expected margin to attend to the cries of the young refugee youth.  Education  Finn Church Aid (FCA) together with the other implementing partners are increasing access to inclusive, safe, protective and child-friendly education for South Sudanese refugee children through the construction of semi-permanent infrastructure as well as improving the quality of teaching and learning outcomes in seven primary schools through teachers training, construction of teacher accommodation, provision of inclusive teaching and learning materials and supporting assessment and provision of appropriate services to children with special needs in the refugee camps.  Food and Nutrition  South Sudanese refugees wait in line for food to be served to them in Omugo refugee camp in Northern Uganda as a practice to provide food and nutrition services to the refugees. This method of lining to be served is one of the commonest of other similar ways refugees get served in the many camps and is prone to congestion and close contact to the next person just in order to get to the food and be served.  Water and Sanitation  In a bid to promote Water, Sanitation and household health under WASH, Oxfam awarded cash benefits to refugees with special needs in the refugee settlements of Imvepi and Omugo which happened at the end of 2019. This is an indicator that the water and sanitation sector at Omugo refugee settlement is taken into account and awarded significant attention. This therefore comes as good news to those in dire need of support, that the Special Needs people are not forgotten too.  Health  The M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) sexual violence and mental health clinic in the Omugo refugee settlement in the Rhino camp extension has been established in order to help the young girls and mothers know the impact and dangers of sexual violence that are seen happening in the refugee settlements as a way to challenge them to act towards their right to know that the vice of violence against women and girls exists and needs an immediate response to. The Health experts at the clinic have time to ask refugee women and girls to share their views and opinions about sexual violence against women and girls at the refugee camp of Omugo. <> References Category:Refugee camps in Uganda Category:Arua District Category:South Sudan‚ÄìUganda relations Category:South Sudanese diaspora Category:2017 establishments in Uganda ","title":"Omugo refugee settlement"},{"id":"65431574","text":"Amygdalota (; almond pears) are a type of almond cookie associated with the Cyclades.

When reaching St. Peter Mancroft in Norwich, Francis Blomefield, Rector of Fersfield in Norfolk, was met with the following view: The following inscriptions are in the nave; and first of those on brass plates, beginning at the most eastern part, just by the step out of the chancel, lies a large stone, having the effigies of a mayor in his robes, between his two wives; by the first wife are the effigies of her children, two boys and two girls; and by the second four girls; it being placed here in memory of Richard Aylmer, mayor in 1511, son of Robert Aylmer, who was mayor in 1481, and 1492, and Joan his first wife; he died in 1512. > Aylmer Ricardus Procerum de stipite natus, Is quondam Maior Urbis, iacet hic > tumulatus, Natis cum prima atque suis Consorte Johanna, Moribus ornatus, > Bonus omnibus atque benignus, Anno Milleno, D. bino, cum duodeno, Idus > septembris trino, migrauit ab orbe.

The Ruined St. Michael's Church, Mintlyn Elizabeth Thursby, the 15-great grandmother of Prince Williiam, Duke of Cambridge, is possibly Richard Aylmer's half-sister from his mother's third marriage to Thomas Thursby (d.1510). Thomas Thursby was married several times, so there is some uncertainty as to who the mother of his children was. If the birth date given for his son of the same name, 1487, is correct, he cannot possibly be the son of Elizabeth, as she was still the wife of Robert Aylmer (d.1493) then. However, certainly Richard's daughter Cecily mentions ' my aunte Thorysby' in her will, leaving her a spoon of silver and six shillings and eight pence, indicating that at least one of Thomas Thursby's children was by Elizabeth. She also mentions her 'sister' Grenall, which must be Margery Thursby, married name Grindell. Thomas Thursby spells the name 'Gryndell' in his will. Margery had already had a son, John, by 3 May 1510 when the will is dated. Curiously, Thomas Thursby is involved in a suit in 1504‚Äì15 with John, son of John Gryndell, and Margery, his wife, daughter and heir of Robert Pylly over a tenement built on a common lane in Lynn, allegedly fraudulently conveyed by Thomas Thursby to Richard Pepir, who married Margaret, another daughter of Robert Pylly. Richard Aylmer writes of 'my brother ffrannces mountford', the husband of Thomas Thursby's daughter Margaret, in his will. The names of Thomas Thursby's daughters, Elizabeth, Ellen, Beatrice, Margaret and Margery, correspond almost perfectly with known Aylmer given names. Richard's mother Elizabeth is not the daughter of John Burgoyne who in the Visitations of Cambridgeshire marries 'Thomas Thorseby of Norfolk', as that Elizabeth is still alive and apparently a wife in 1528, when she receives an inheritance from her mother Margaret. Nor can she be the wife of his son, as that Thomas Thursby was marrying Anne Knyvett in 1527. Anne Thorysby along with Elyn Grenall are two of the witnesses of Cecily Aylmer's will in 1541. She is probably the Isabel, late the wife of Thomas Thursby, who is involved in a suit in 1532‚Äì38. Isabel and Elizabeth were considered the same name in the period.

In May 1992 they arrived by boat in Australia, after having left the PRC without permission from the authorities. Officials from DIEA detained the respondents alongside other passengers on the boat in a detention center. Sometime that month an application was made by Guo for a refugee visa. A delegate refused the application on 28 May 1992. The respondents then applied for review of the delegate's decision at committee. The committee affirmed the delegate's decision, and their findings were affirmed by another delegate.191 CLR 559, BRENNAN CJ, DAWSON, TOOHEY, GAUDRON, McHUGH AND GUMMOW JJ at [9] - [14] Prior to deportation Mr Guo and his brother participated in a public protest at Port Hedland. He and other protestors wore headbands marked with Chinese characters for 'hunger strike', and bore placards protesting against their treatment by the department. Three members jumped off a rooftop during the protest, including Mr Guo. Guo was identified as the protest leader in the publicity that subsequently arose. Subsequently, Guo others were deported to the PRC. Upon their re-entry they were detained for five days. The two brothers were then detained a further 23 days and fined 3,000 RMB. Guo claimed to have been rearrested and detained for four months from 5 June 1993, however the Tribunal rejected this claim in a later application. (made seven months later, and the subject of this appeal) On 5 December 1993 Guo and a group of relatives arrived in Broome. On 14 December the department received applications for refugee status; on the ground they had a well-founded fear of persecution of reason of political opinion. They claimed that, because they had illegally departed the PRC in 1992, and in 1993 had breached the one child policy; they would be persecuted for their political opinion. They also claimed to belong to a social group of Chinese citizens opposed to the one child policy. A delegate refused this application on 31 January 1994, and this was affirmed by Tribunal.191 CLR 559, BRENNAN CJ, DAWSON, TOOHEY, GAUDRON, McHUGH AND GUMMOW JJ at [15] - [17] The Tribunal found that nothing that occurred to Guo after he was deported to the PRC in 1992, was politically motivated. It found that his detention in China had merely been a consequence of penalties for illegal departure, and not because of his political activities. Charges for illegal departure were found to be unrelated to convention grounds; as they were applied to the Chinese population in general.191 CLR 559, BRENNAN CJ, DAWSON, TOOHEY, GAUDRON, McHUGH AND GUMMOW JJ at [29] Guo then sought judicial review. The Full Federal Court upheld his appeal, unanimously. Beaumont J upheld Guo's appeal, finding that the Tribunal had not considered whether political reasons could be inferred as informing the PRC authority's actions. Einfeld J held that the Tribunal had erred in making findings on the balance of probabilities, undermining the real chance test established in Chan. The Minister appealed to the High Court, in doing so making an undertaking as to costs.  Judgement  The High Court unanimously held that the Tribunal had not effectively applied a balance of probabilities test. The majority discussed the four elements for a 'refugee' finding, under the convention. They found that Guo did not satisfy one of the elements; that the person must be persecuted for a 'convention reason'. Membership of a social group consisting of 'parents of one child in the PRC' did not constitute, the court held, a 'particular social group' under the convention.191 CLR 559, BRENNAN CJ, DAWSON, TOOHEY, GAUDRON, McHUGH AND GUMMOW JJ at [43] Turning to the 'well-founded fear' element of the test, the High Court criticized the Federal Court's direct application of Chan's real chance test. The court stressed that the test was a clarification of the convention's term 'well-founded', and shouldn't be used in substitution for the convention's words. They accused Einfeld J of having substituted and used the 'real chance' test exclusively; when he found the Tribunal had erred for having 'shunned speculation' 191 CLR 559, BRENNAN CJ, DAWSON, TOOHEY, GAUDRON, McHUGH AND GUMMOW JJ at [48] The court then turned to the FFCA's finding that the Tribunal had applied the balance of probabilities test, instead of the 'real chance' test. The High Court quoted a previous statement in Wu Shan Liang, which had said: > \\"When conflicting information available to the Minister's delegate relates > to some past event ... the attribution of greater weight to one piece of > information as against another or an opinion that one version of the facts > is more probable than another is not necessarily inconsistent with the > correct application of the Chan test.\\" Despite this, they found that courts must consider both possible outcomes within any balance of probabilities finding; to ensure that the well-founded test is what applies. I.e. 'If, for example, a Tribunal finds that it is only slightly more probable than not that an applicant has not been punished for a Convention reason, it must take into account the chance that the applicant was so punished when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution'. They found that in the case before it, the Tribunal had 'no real doubt that its findings both as to the past and future were correct'.191 CLR 559, BRENNAN CJ, DAWSON, TOOHEY, GAUDRON, McHUGH AND GUMMOW JJ at [59] - [61] The Court therefore found for the Minister.  Significance  Guo is a significant judgement for the legal tests that apply for refugee determinations. Its development of that jurisprudence shortly followed the High Court's previous rulings in Chan and Wu Shan Liang. Guo is frequently cited alongside those cases in judgements and Tribunal decisions which discuss the convention's determination requirements. For example, in MIMA v Rajalingam Sackville J wrote: > \\"... the requirement in Wu Shan Liang and Guo (is) simply an aspect of the > obligation to apply correctly the principles for determining whether an > applicant has a ‚Äúwell-founded fear of being persecuted‚Äù for a Convention > reason. The reasonable speculation in which the decision-maker must engage > may require him or her to take account of the chance that past events might > have occurred, even though the decision-maker thinks that they probably did > not.\\" 93 FCR 220, para 63 The case has also been regarded as an authority for the proposition that 'past harm may be relevant to, but not determinative of, future persecution'.

The common name is sparkling northern jumping spider. When in motion, the male spider bobs its abdomen up and down reflecting sunlight that causes a characteristic sparkle. Description There are significant differences in colour and patterns between male and female Cosmophasis micarioides. The male is black with iridescent bands of blue-green, and has a longitudinal mark on the abdomen. The female is orange-brown with lighter coloured bands of green and brown that lie across the abdomen. The pattern of marks on the female is quite variable and not reliable for identification. The distinguishing feature is that stripes on the side of the head of both sexes reach down to the rim of the carapace, as opposed to the very similar Cosmophasis thalassina where black does not extend as far as the rim. The abdomen of the male is narrower than the female. The subadult male has orange in place of black on top of the carapace. The species is widespread and common in tropical Australia and south to Brisbane. Body length from head to tail is for females and for males.

Regio IV took its name from the Temple of Peace built in the region by the emperor Vespasian. It includes the valley between the Esquiline and the Viminal hills, the popular area of the Subura, and the Velian Hill. Geographic extent and important features Drawing of the ruins of the Temple of Peace (1575) Although centred on the Temple of Peace within the Imperial fora, Regio IV was cut in two by the Clivus Suburanus. To the north west, it was bordered by the Vicus Patricius, the Clivus Suburanus and the Servian Wall and included the Carinae. To the south east, it was bordered by the Colosseum and the Roman Forum, and included the Imperial fora and the Subura. A measurement taken at the end of the 4th century recorded that the perimeter of the region was 13,000 Roman feet (approximately 3.84km).Notitia, REGIO IV TEMPLVM PACIS The remains of the Temple of Peace When first organised by Augustus, Regio IV was initially called the Via Sacra, after the street of the same name. Its name was altered after the construction of the Temple of Peace by Vespasian, and the region was noted for its magnificent imperial buildings.Gregorovius, pgs. 32-33 Adjacent to the Colosseum stood the Meta Sudans of Domitian, a large monumental conical fountain estimated to have stood over 17 metres high. Also next to the Colosseum was the Colossus of Nero, itself standing some 30 metres high, that the emperor Hadrian later had moved to the stand beneath the double temple of Venus and Roma, which was also in Regio IV. This was the largest temple in ancient Rome, and with its immense Corinthian pillars and gilt roof, it was reckoned by the historian Ammianus Marcellinus as one of the greatest buildings of Rome.Lanciani, Rodolfo Amedeo (1901) The Destruction of Ancient Rome Adjacent and to the north of the Temple of Venus and Roma stood the Basilica of Maxentius which was inaugurated by Constantine the Great after his victory over his rival Maxentius. Further north, there stood the Temple of Peace and the Forum Pacis which, along with the forum transitorium bordered the southernmost part of the Imperial fora (the fora formed part of the seventh region).Gregorovius, pg. 33 The region also contained a Temple dedicated to Jupiter Startor, most likely the one built during the Flavian period.Planter, pgs. 303-304 This temple no longer exists, but the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina that faces the Roman Forum still stands. Next to it stands the remains of the Basilica Aemilia which had been originally erected in 179 BCE before being remodelled and renamed as the Basilica Paulli. Away from the immediate vicinity of the Roman Forum, the region contained the Temple of Tellus, sited at the Carinae. An old temple, it was restored by Cicero in about 54 BCE and then rebuilt after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE. Finally it included the Sororium Tigillum, on the Vicus Cyprius, which the ancient Romans built to the memory of Horatius. The region also originally contained the Velian Hill, the hill between the Palatine and the Oppian Hill. This hill was removed in the early 20th century to make way for the via dei Fori Imperiali, the street passing between the Forum Romanum and the Forum of Augustus). At the turn of the 5th century, the Regio contained eight aediculae (shrines), 88 dom≈´s (patrician houses), 18 horrea (warehouses), 75 balneae (bath houses) and 78 loci (fountains).Notitia, REGIO IV TEMPLVM PACIS Subdivisions At the turn of the 5th century, the Regio was divided into eight vici (districts) and 2,757 insulae (blocks). It had two curators and was served by 48 Roman magistrates.Notitia, REGIO IV TEMPLVM PACIS Notes References * Platner, Samuel Ball, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, Oxford University Press (1929) (online version) * Gregorovius, Ferdinand, History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages, Vol. 1, (1894) * DISCRIPTIO XIIII REGIONVM VRBIS ROM√Ü, Curiosum - Notitia. 4th-century descriptions of the regions of Rome and their main buildings.

Biography Evaristo Vi√±uales Larroy was born into an educated family: his father and aunt, Evaristo and Gregoria Vi√±uales Escart√≠n, were both teachers at the Escuela Normal of Huesca. After the early death of his father on August 15, 1928, the young Evaristo completed his exams to become a teacher, following the family tradition. His fellow students, including Francisco Ponz√°n Vidal and Miguel Chueca Cuartero, were all educated by the anarcho-syndicalist teacher Ram√≥n Ac√≠n Aquilu√©. In 1931, with the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, he joined the National Confederation of Labor (, CNT). He was arrested several times for his syndicalist activities: in February 1932, in April 1933, during the general strike of November 1933, and at the end of 1934, when he was sentenced to two years in prison in Alcal√° de Henares. After the 1936 Spanish general election, Vi√±uales Larroy was paroled and returned to work immediately. Together with his colleagues Eusebi Carb√≥n y Carb√≥n and Jaume Balius y Mir, he founded the weekly libertarian theory publication M√°s Lejos (). Among the magazine's contributors were Josep Peirats Valls, Federica Montseny, Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n, Alexander Schapiro and Emma Goldman. In December 1936, Vi√±uales Larroy participated in the Regional Defense Council of Aragon as information and propaganda advisor: in this position he was assisted by F√©lix Carrasquer Launed and together they founded the School of Libertarian Militants of Aragon. In July 1937, as secretary of the Regional Committee of Anarchist Groups of Aragon, he took part in the peninsular meeting of the Iberian Anarchist Federation. During this period, he collaborated with libertarian newspapers Cultura y Acci√≥n, Tit√°n and Nuevo Arag√≥n. The destruction of collectivization, carried out systematically by the republican troops commanded by Enrique L√≠ster, pushed Vi√±uales and M√°ximo Franco Cavero to join the 127th Mixed Brigade, formerly the Red and Black Column. Appointed captain, he fought in the column until the end of the war. When defeat was evident, with nationalist troops advancing and Republican troops in total retreat, Vi√±uales and Cavero decided that they would not end up at the hands of the fascists. Both committed suicide together on April 1, 1939, shooting themselves while shaking hands. \\"This is our last protest against fascism,\\" Evaristo said before pulling the trigger. Evaristo Vi√±uales Larroy's partner, Lorenza Sarsa Hern√°ndez, managed to cross the Pyrenees, together with their daughter, Ze√Øka Sonia (born November 22, 1938). The Gestapo captured them but they were released years later through the intervention of Francisco Ponz√°n Vidal's resistance group.

The process marks a paradigmatic shift in understanding the concept of knowledge in modern period. It has rejected the notion that knowledge has spiritual-metaphysical foundations and is therefore related to the sacred. Although a recurrent theme among the writers of Traditionalist school that began with Rene Guenon, a French mystic and intellectual who earlier spoke of 'the limitation of knowledge to its lowest order', the process of desacralization of knowledge was most notably surveyed, chronicled and conceptualized by Islamic philosopher Seyyed Hossein Nasr in his 1981 Gifford Lectures which was later published as Knowledge and the Sacred. Concept In Nasr's assessment, desacralization of knowledge is one of the most significant aspects of secularism. He defines secularism as ‚Äòeverything whose origin is merely human and therefore non-divine and whose metaphysical basis lies in this ontological hiatus between man and God'.. Secularism, Nasr argues, is an evil force that has caused science and knowledge to become desacralized. In this process, science and knowledge became separated and lost their homogenous character in the form of traditional knowledge.. The core idea of desacralization of knowledge is that modern civilization has lost the transcendent roots of knowledge in restricting knowledge to the empirical domain alone.. Dictionary of Literary Biography states: > [Nasr's] central thesis is that true knowledge is profoundly and by its very > essence related to the sacred. This idea, he argues, underlies the basic > teachings of every traditional religion whether Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, > Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Islam or Christianity. Only in the Modern world, > which he dates from the Renaissance, has the connection between knowledge > and the sacred been lost.. In Nasr's exposition, the words ‚Äòto know‚Äô and ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô forfeit their unidimensional character. In his view, \\"knowledge' extends in hierarchy from an empirical and rational mode of knowing to the highest form of knowledge, that is, the ‚Äòunitive knowledge‚Äô, or al-ma‚Äôrifah.\\" Similarly, \\"to know' extends from ratiocination to intellection.\\". By nature, argues Nasr, knowledge is inseparable from being and therefore related to the Sacred. To be human, Nasr argues, is to know. To know therefore means ultimately knowing the Supreme Self who is the source of all knowledge and consciousness.. It is the post medieval process of secularization and a humanism that has ultimately ‚Äúforced the separation of knowing from being and intelligence from the Sacred‚Äù.. Stefano Bigliardi of Al Akhawayn University states: > Knowledge of the Absolute means knowledge of the existence of superior > spiritual levels, of the interrelatedness of the phenomena of nature, of the > interrelatedness of their respective elements, and most importantly, of the > derivation of everything from the Absolute itself. However, the awareness > (and therefore the usage) of Intellect according to Nasr has been lost, > together with the awareness of the Absolute itself. In Nasr‚Äôs reconstruction > such oblivion characterizes the whole course of human thought that, in its > dominant manifestations, can be described as a continuous desacralization of > knowledge.. Nasr explains that modern science has reduced multiple domains of reality to a mere psycho-physical one. Without a sacred vision, Nasr argues, science thus became concerned with the changes in material world alone. For the reason that modern science has abandoned the notion of hierarchy of being, scientific theories and discoveries can no longer appreciate the truths that belong to a higher order of reality. Modern Science, in Nasr's words, is therefore an ‚Äòincomplete‚Äô or ‚Äòsuperficial science‚Äô which only concerns with certain parts of reality while invalidating others.. It is based on the distinction between the knowing subject and the known object. Nasr argues that modern science has lost its symbolic spirit and the dimension of transcendence as it has repudiated the role of intellect in pursuing knowledge and truth by adopting a pure quantitative method... The structure of reality, in Nasr's contention, is unchanging. What changes is the vision and perception of human being about that reality. Having no sense of permanence, modern western philosophy has reduced the reality to a mere temporal process. This phenomenon, Jane Smith notes, is what Nasr identifies as the desacralization of knowledge and the loss of the sense of the sacred.. Historical development In saying 'I think, therefore I am,' Nasr contends, \\"Descartes was not referring to the divine I who some seven centuries before Descartes had uttered through the mouth of Mansur al-Hallaj, 'I am the Truth' (ana‚Äôl-Haqq), the Divine Self which alone can say I\\". The final step toward desacralization was taken by Hegel who reduced 'the whole process of knowledge to a dialectic inseparable from change and becoming'. The process of desacralization of knowledge had already begun with the ancient Greeks.. The rationalists and skeptics of ancient Greek philosophical traditions, Nasr argues, played a major role in the process of desacralization by reducing knowledge either to ratiocination or mere cognitive exercise.. In substituting reason for intellect and sensuous knowledge for inner illumination, the Greeks, is thus said to have pioneered the process of desacralization of knowledge. Other major stages in the process of desacralization include the formation of Renaissance philosophical systems that had developed a concept of nature which is independent and self-creative. The process, however, reached its climax in the thought of Ren√© Descartes. who 'made thinking of the individual ego the center of reality and criterion of all knowledge.'. Thereafter, knowledge, even if it were to reach distant galaxies, eventually became rooted in the cogito. Dictionary of Literary Biography summarizes: > Nasr analyzes the modern desacralization of knowledge and the consequent > eclipse of human intelligence[..].[..]The roots of the crisis, he says, go > back as far as the rationalists and skeptics of ancient Greece, but more > immediate and grave in effect was the humanism of the Renaissance which > shifted the focus of knowledge from God to human beings and from the sacred > cosmos to the secular order, and the full blown rationalism of the > Enlightenment which reduced human knowledge to reason alone. Nasr contends > that epistemology since Descartes has taken an increasingly reductionist > trajectory in which the traditional doctrine of knowledge rooted in > intellection and revelation was replaced by an idolatry of reason. > Rationalism gave way to empiricism, with its tendency to reject metaphysics > altogether; and empiricism has been followed by various forms of > irrationalism, including existentialism and deconstructionism. The general > course of modern history has been one of desacralization and decay, robbing > humanity of intelligence and stripping the cosmos of beauty and meaning.. Liu Shu-hsien, a Neo-Confucian philosopher, writes: > Nasr's critique of modem European philosophy has also presented a very > interesting perspective. He pointed out that Descartes's individual was not > referring to Atman or the divine I, but rather the \\"illusory\\" self, which > was placing its experience and consciousness of thinking as the foundation > of all epistemology and ontology and the source of certitude. After the > Humean doubt, Kant taught an agnosticism which in a characteristically > subjective fashion denied to the intellect the possibility of knowing the > essence of things. This situation further deteriorated into the Hegelian and > Marxist dialectics, as they denied that there is anything immutable behind > the appearance, and this loss of the sense of permanence was characteristic > of mainstream thought of modem Western philosophy. In the analytic > philosophy and irrational philosophies that followed, the sacred quality of > knowledge was completely destroyed.. One 'powerful instrument' of desacralization in history includes the theory of evolution., which, in Nasr's words, 'is a desperate attempt to substitute a set of horizontal, material causes in a unidimensional world to explain effects whose causes belong to other levels of reality, to the vertical dimensions of existence.'. He argues that the theory of evolution and its use by modernists and liberal theologians like Aurobindo Ghose and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin has been a 'major force' in the process of desacralization of knowledge.. The 'roots of the betrayal', in David Burrel's words, however, may well be found 'on the other side of Descartes', in the high scholasticism which includes the thought of Aquinas and Bonaventure and Duns Scotus. Their syntheses, Nasr argues, 'tended to become over-rationalistic in imprisoning intuitions of a metaphysical order in syllogistic categories which were to hide, rather than reveal, their properly speaking intellectual rather than purely rational character.'. Effects The occasion of the 'fall' of the West is marked by its turn towards desacralized knowledge, which begins with the adoption of the rationalist wing of ancient Greek thought, particularly Aristotle. Externalisation and desacralization of knowledge has led to the belief that all that can be understood is science in terms of information, quantification, analysis and their subsequent technological implications. The questions of religion, God, eternal life and the nature of the soul are all outside the realm of scientific knowledge and thus are only matters of faith.. The desacralized knowledge has affected all areas of culture including art, science and religion. It has had an impact on human nature as well.. Moreover, the effect of desacralized, profane knowledge is felt within the value system, thought processes and structure of feelings.. The desacralized knowledge and science, Nasr argues, affects the employment of technology and has resulted in ecological catastrophes in present world. It results in highly compartmentalized science whose ignorance of the divine destroys the outward and inward spiritual ambience of human beings... Reception For Liu Shu- hsien the process of desacralization of knowledge is not as bad as Nasr has anticipated. On the contrary, Shu-hsien argues, there is an overwhelming necessity for desacralization of knowledge within the domain of empirical science for the reason that the quest of certainty is no longer a viable objective.. For David Harvey, the Enlightenment thought sought demystification and desacralization of knowledge and social organization in order to free human beings from their bonds.. Svend Brinkmann independently argues on the need for desacralization of knowledge stating that 'if knowing is a human activity, it is always already situated somewhere ‚Äì in some cultural, historical and social situation'.. David Burrell argues on the other hand that, in a world that is explicitly postmodern, scholars are more at ease with Nasr's criticism of ‚ÄòEnlightenment philosophical paradigm‚Äô than ever before. Those who would argue that ‚Äòif knowledge cannot be secured in Descartes‚Äôs fashion, it cannot be secured at all‚Äô might find themselves dragging along their modern presumptions..

It belongs to the Church of Sweden and is a listed building. It was built in the early 12th century, at a time when Scania was part of Denmark. The building was commissioned by a member of the Danish royal family, probably Queen Margaret Fredkulla. The church originally consisted of a nave, a chancel with an apse and two western towers. Quite soon after being finished, it was donated to Premonstratensian monks who used it as the church of their monastery until 1213. It simultaneously functioned as the parish church of V√§. At the end of the Middle Ages, a third tower was built, and in 1593 the building was enlarged. At the beginning of the 19th century, the western towers were demolished. A major restoration was carried out in the 1960s. The church is one of the oldest stone churches in Sweden and shows several similarities with Lund Cathedral, built at approximately the same time. Although some of the original stone sculptures have been destroyed, some have been preserved. For example, the western portal still displays its original sculptured capitals. The interior also contains some of the oldest church murals in Sweden. These decorate the chancel and the apse. In the chancel, the barrel vault ceiling is decorated with figures carrying speech scrolls of the Christian hymn Te Deum, a subject matter not found elsewhere among medieval murals in Sweden. The apse is dominated by a mural depicting Christ in Majesty. Location and surroundings The church is located on a small hill south of a small brook. It is situated within its own cemetery. During the Middle Ages the town of V√§, surrounding the church, was a locally important centre of trade and enjoyed town privileges. It was, like the rest of the province of Scania, part of Denmark until the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. After having been pillaged by Swedish troops, the Danish King Christian IV decided to move the settlement to a more easily defended location. In 1614 V√§ was degraded to the status of village, while most of the population moved to the newly founded city Kristianstad, approximately away. History =Foundation and construction= View of the church from the east, showing the well-preserved original apse V√§ Church is one of the oldest stone churches in Scania. Several letters of donation from the 12th century, preserved through later copies, show that the church was donated by the Danish queen consort Sophia of Minsk and the king, Valdemar I of Denmark, to Premonstratensian monks some time after its construction. Contrary to what was common practice at the time, the letters of donation mention her name together with that of the king. This may indicate that the church and its incomes were the personal inheritance of the queen, rather than the king. The church thus clearly belonged to the Danish royal family prior to the donation, but it is not known who commissioned the building and its age has been the matter of discussion. When it was renovated in the 1960s, a scrap of parchment was discovered in a lead box concealed in the medieval altar, bearing a date which has been interpreted as 1131. Archaeologists have assumed that this date refers to the dedication of the church. Among the preserved murals there are two donor portraits of a king and a queen. Unusually, these depict the queen as the main donor of the church. Queen Margaret Fredkulla died around 1130, and had family connections to the and the Byzantine Empire, which could explain the strong influences of Byzantine art in the architecture of the building. There is also a faint inscription in runes in the chancel. Although difficult to interpret, it may contain the names of some close relatives to the queen. For these reasons it is assumed that the church was commissioned by Margaret Fredkulla. Earlier theories put forward King Canute V, King Niels or Queen Richeza as possible builders. It was originally dedicated to Saint Mary and probably built nearby a royal estate. =Further changes= Ground plan of the church: original parts in black, later additions in grey The church originally consisted of a nave with a flat wooden roof, two western towers, a western entrance and a barrel vaulted chancel with an apse. It was possibly built in two stages, and finished by the time it was donated to the Premonstratensians in the 1160s. It then served as the church of their monastery and simultaneously functioned as the parish church of the borough of V√§, probably during the entire Middle Ages. The Premonstratensians made few changes to the church. A southern entrance was created, the west entrance altered and, possibly, a rood screen installed. A fire ravaged the building in 1213, and after this the monks moved away to found a new monastery on the site of present-day B√§ckaskog Castle. During the 13th century, the vaults were constructed, replacing the wooden ceiling of the nave, and the walls were made slightly higher and the gables steeper. A third tower, the only one still preserved, was built at the end of the Middle Ages to house the church bells. The church was extended towards the north in 1593. The windows, which were successively enlarged during several centuries, probably attained their current shape in 1781. In 1804 the two western towers were demolished, and the church was again damaged by fire in 1810. Several proposals to restore the by then rather dilapidated building were put forward during 19th century. The entire interior was whitewashed, and in 1854 the walls and ceiling of the chancel were decorated with Neoclassical decorations. Plans for a thorough renovation were made in the 1920s but it was not until the 1960s that the church was restored and an archaeological survey conducted. Architecture V√§ Church was built around the same time as Lund Cathedral, which lies about from V√§, and the similarities between the two buildings have been pointed out frequently. The monumental aspect, high quality of the craftsmanship of the builders, and several stylistic features connect V√§ Church with the cathedral in Lund. Notably the apse and the decorative elements, influenced by contemporary Lombardic architecture, are clearly similar to corresponding elements in Lund Cathedral. =Exterior= The southern capitals of the main entrance The earliest parts of the building are easily distinguished from the later additions, which are whitewashed. In contrast, the original parts of the building are constructed of finely cut ashlars made of greyish sandstone. The building seen today consists of a nave which incorporates the base of the former western towers, a chancel and an apse. The tower is joined with the nave approximately halfway along its south facade. The extension from 1593 is two bays wide and extends from the nave to the north. The total length of the church is . The facade of the nave and chancel are decorated with lesenes at the corners, and corbel tables supporting the cornice at the height of the original walls; the top part of the nave walls are later and whitewashed. The apse is divided by four narrow columns, double corbel tables and a more marked cornice supporting the roof. Originally there were three portals leading into the church, of which the western one has been preserved relatively intact. The northern portal has vanished and the southern has been altered. It now connects the sacristy, located in the base of the tower, with the nave. The western portal still serves as the main entrance and is a round arched portal decorated with decorated capitals. The southern capitals are decorated with plant ornaments and the northern with figurative sculptures. The southern portal, now only visible from inside the sacristy, has an equally rich sculptural decoration. From the northern portal nothing remains except the decorated tympanum, found during the renovation of the church in the 1960s. Its decoration is almost identical to sculptures found in Lund Cathedral. Four original sculpted stones, depicting beasts and religious symbols, are also incorporated in the eastern part of the facade. In 1945, it was discovered that the weather vane on the roof was an aquamanile in the form of a knight on horseback, dating from the Romanesque era, i.e. the construction period of the church. It is one of only two such aquamaniles known in Sweden. The aquamanile was subsequently restored and exhibited in the church. A simplified copy was made to replace it as a weather vane. =Interior= View of the nave from the chancel, towards the west The best-preserved part of the interior is the eastern end, notably the chancel and the apse. The chancel is covered with an original barrel vault, and the apse by a semi-dome. There are four capitals preserved in each corner of the chancel. They may have been intended to carry a rib vault which was never built. The nave is dominated by the two central pillars carrying six rib vaults which were constructed in the 13th century. A large part of the north wall of the original nave has been demolished when the 1598 extension to the north was built, creating a shortened north transept. The nave is connected with the chancel through a wide, round arched chancel arch which is original. The west end of the church, the area surrounding the main entrance, originally also served as a base for the two towers which were demolished in the early 19th century. Above the main entrance there is a small room, which could have been a gallery once used by members of the royal family. From there they could participate in the celebration of mass without having to mingle with the congregation. Murals V√§ Church contains some of the oldest‚Äîpossibly the very oldest‚Äîchurch murals in Sweden. They have been described as being \\"of excellent quality, also compared with the rest of Europe\\". Their style is Italo-Byzantine, in the same tradition as e.g. the murals in the (France), St. Gabriel's Chapel in Canterbury Cathedral (England) or the Znojmo Rotunda (Czech Republic). In style they are closely related to those in in Wunstorf, Germany. These stylistic traits may have arrived from Eastern Europe, perhaps conveyed through the many personal contacts between the Danish royal family and the nobility of . The murals decorate the entire chancel roof, the west wall of the chancel and the apse. The semi-dome of the apse shows Christ in Majesty, sitting on a rainbow with Earth as his footstool. The right hand of Christ is raised in a sign of blessing, and the left hand holds a book. He is dressed in an alb with blue details, decorated with clavi, golden bands originally denoting the majesty of the Roman emperor, but here signifying the Lord of Heaven. He is surrounded by the symbols of the Four Evangelists. This representation is typical for early Romanesque art in southern Sweden, but the painting is larger than usual, painted using unusually expensive pigments, and may indicate how the apse of Lund Cathedral could have been decorated originally. Beneath the semi-dome there are badly damaged murals depicting, on the north wall, what is probably an archangel and Saint Mary. On the wall between the apse and the chancel there are depictions of (possibly) two prophets. The chancel roof and the murals The barrel vault of the chancel is unique. A total of 24 round medallions contain images of angels, apostles and saints carrying speech scrolls with the text of the Christian hymn Te Deum. There are six rows with four medallions in each. The background is a representation of heaven, a blue sky with golden stars. The medallions are framed by concentric circles similar to the mandorla surrounding Christ in the apse, and the figures painted inside them have alternating rich or simple clothing. The pictorial programme of the chancel serves to emphasize liturgical elements from the Christian mass. On the wall of the chancel facing the apse there are the two donor portraits mentioned above, representing a king and a queen. Both are dressed in ornate Byzantine dress. The paintings were once whitewashed. In 1854, the paintings in the apse were uncovered and an attempt to restore them was made. In 1963, work was begun to restore the murals. The three-year-long project was led by V√•ga Andersson-Lindell. Furnishings The baptismal font of the church is a copy of the original, which was moved to the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm in 1867. The original font dates from sometime between 1175 and 1225 and is decorated with floral decorations and part of the text of the Hail Mary. On the north wall of the nave hangs a wooden cross, dated to 1400 on stylistic grounds. During the renovation of the building, a wooden altarpiece from 1674 was moved from the chancel to the north aisle. The central panel of the altarpiece contains a depiction of the Last Supper, while the upper part contains the coat of arms of both County Governor and the coat of arms of Sweden. As Sweden had conquered the province from Denmark in 1658, the installation of the altarpiece can be seen as a political statement. The wooden pulpit dates from 1630. Its sides are decorated with sculptures depicting the Four Evangelists. The simple altar is the fourth altar of the church and was made in 1966, together with a golden cross designed by goldsmith . Use and heritage status V√§ Church belongs to the Church of Sweden. It is one of two churches in , a parish within the Diocese of Lund.

The ruins lie on the Kiachi hill, near the modern-day village of Jgerda, 8 km south of the Kodori river, in the Tsebelda valley. The name Kvitouli refers to a historical community to which the church belonged and of which the modern-day village of Kutol/Kutoli is part.  Layout  The ruined church is a three-nave basilica, built of porous stone, 17.5 m in length and 16.5 m in width. Better preserved are the altar portion and southern wall of the central nave. The church has a rectangular plan, aisles being asymmetrical. The northern nave is divided into three parts. The only entrance is on the west. No openings in the side walls have survived. The vault of the central nave rests on three pairs of pilasters in the longitudinal walls. Based on the shape of these elements, the church can tentatively be dated to the 11th century. History The first recorded mention of the Kiachi church is found in a Georgian inscription of a ripidion (liturgical fan) which is dated by the art historian Giorgi Chubinashvili, based on its style and iconography, to the 10th century. If the dating is correct, the king George mentioned in the inscription could have been George II of Abkhazia (). The Kiachi church is next heard of ‚Äî as \\"Chiaggi\\" ‚Äî in the writings of Arcangelo Lamberti who led a Catholic proselyting mission in western Georgian principalities from 1633 to 1649. In 1640, Levan II Dadiani, prince-regnant of Mingrelia‚Äîwho held sway of parts of Abkhazia at that time‚Äîdonated to the Kiachi church an icon of the Archangel, adorned with precious stones and a Georgian inscription, which makes note of the occasion. An abbot at Kiachi was instructed to bring the icon to the nearby princely palace at Kvitauri twice a year. As the Dadiani control of Abkhazia eroded and Christian culture went in decline later in that century, the precious objects of Kiachi were evacuated to relative security in Mingrelia, the icon of the Archangel in Choga and the ripidion (which was also venerated as an icon) in Obuji. By 1681, a new church had been built in Obuji to house the ripidion and also became known as Kiachi. Nowadays, both the Kiachi icon of the Archangel and the ripidion are on display at the Dadiani Palace Museum in Zugdidi, formerly the main town of the Principality of Mingrelia.

Penerbitan Harian Waspada. Having first published on 11 January 1947, it is the second oldest continuously published newspaper in Indonesia, only behind Kedaulatan Rakyat. It is one of the largest newspapers in the city.  History  Waspada was first published by Mohammad Said and his wife Ani Idrus on 11 January 1947, in the midst of Indonesian National Revolution. The name Waspada comes from Mohammad Said advice to the public to be \\"aware\\" in facing various possibilities in the nation's struggle against the Dutch, especially the Dutch strategy which resulted in huge losses for the Republic of Indonesia sovereignty and its fighters. Its first numbers only consisted of two pages. Issuance of the second number on Monday (because the paper was not published on Sunday) had to be compacted, on the opposite page only a notice was displayed. The newspaper was firmly declared itself to be the supporters of Indonesian independence. This stance was shown through firm and sharp news and articles against the Dutch who continued to try to exert their influence and grip on occupying Medan and its surroundings in order to control plantation lands, such as the tobacco area or spice commodities. In September 1964, the leadership of Waspada were passed to Tribuana Said, the eldest son of Mohammad Said and Ani Idrus. Tribuana Said's sympathetic appearance led many publishers of Medan-based newspapers to appoint him as chairman of the Medan branch of Association for Promoting Sukarnoism (BPS). However, on 17 December 1964 President Soekarno issued a decree to disband the BPS; followed later by the Decree of Minister of Information on 23 February 1965 concerning the ban of 21 newspapers who participated in the BPS, including Waspada. On 17 August 1967 Waspada, led again by Mohammad Said, began publishing again. Waspada has repeatedly changed its motto. The current motto Demi Kebenaran dan Keadilan (For the Sake of Truth and Justice) has been appeared since 1 February 1969. This motto was chosen because it is in accordance with the paper's mission, such as exercising control, criticism and constructive correction in accordance with the law. The online portal Waspada Online was officially established on 11 January 1997 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the paper. On 24 June 2009 Waspada Online was re-launched and inaugurated by Vice President Jusuf Kalla.

It is the oldest house in Bayswater that is still standing. History In 1888, James Halliday bought a 10-acre block of land on what would become King William Street. In 1893, construction started on Halliday House. The house is said to have been constructed by James's son, Henry Thomas Halliday. However it is more probable that it was built by another family member who was a builder, as Henry Halliday was working in the family business at the time. At the time, the building stood out from most other buildings in Bayswater, because it was made of brick, as opposed to the more commonly used corrugated iron or timber weatherboard. The timber used was transported by rail between Fremantle and Bayswater, and by horse-drawn cart between the railway line and the building site. The bricks were probably made by a local brick manufacturer, as there were a few in the area at the time. At first, the house was named Leighton, after Leighton Buzzard, England, the birthplace of Henry's wife Edith. The Halliday family moved into the house in August 1893, whilst it was still under construction. It is not known when the house was completed. When the Bayswater Roads Board was established in 1897, their first meeting was in the house. Henry Halliday was the first chairman of the board. After Henry and Edith Halliday died, the house continued to be inhabited by some of their children. In 1984, the house was sold to Lionel Johnson and Kingsley Dixon, leaving the hands of the Halliday family for the first time since the house was built. The Halliday family offered to sell it to the City of Bayswater for $110,000, but due to the City delaying organising the purchase, it was sold to Johnson and Dixon. At this time, the garden was overgrown and the house was deteriorating. Dr Dixon, who is a well known botanist, restored the garden and house. In 1992, Halliday House was purchased by the City of Bayswater so that the building could be preserved. The City paid $299,000. The City opened up to expressions of interest from people and community groups for use of Halliday House. The Bayswater Historical Society was successful in their application, and they opened Halliday House in 1993 as a museum. In 1994, Halliday House was placed on the State Register of Heritage Places. Presently Halliday House is open between 1pm and 4pm on the fourth Sunday of each month. The Bayswater Historical Society cleans the house, and the City of Bayswater is responsible for maintenance. Description Halliday House is a single story brick house. It is built in the Queen Anne Federation architectural style. A verandah, originally made of timber wraps around the house on all four sides. It was replaced with concrete at an unknown date. Three chimneys extend out of the roof. A decorative path leads up to the front door. Most of the plants currently present were planted there by Dr Kingsley Dixon in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Biography =Early years= Miguel Chueca Cuartero was born in Fuendejal√≥n on January 3, 1901. His father, Bernardo Chueca Sancho, was the village mayor but fell into alcoholism after the death of his wife and gradually got rid of his estate. In 1917, Miguel moved to Barcelona, where he worked as a carpenter and obtained his master's degree. In 1924 he joined the CNT and collaborated in El Productor of Blanes. In the late 1920s he moved to Zaragoza, where he worked as a librarian and collaborated with the magazine Cierzo. He was vice- president of the Republican Youth and vehemently defended the federalist and reformist theses of Joaqu√≠n Costa. On September 9, 1929 he was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1,000 pesetas for conspiracy to rebel, but in August 1930 he still managed to speak at a Pro Amnesty rallies. Between 1930 and 1931 he was editor of La Antorcha and Cultura y Acci√≥n. In July 1930 he participated in the reorganizing commission of the CNT. On December 12, 1930, he took an active part in the Jaca uprising. He participated in the preparations carried out by the National Revolutionary Committee (CRN) and contacted the UGT and the CNT to support the military uprising by calling a general strike, coordinated with Antonio Ejarque Pina from Zaragoza and Ramon Ac√≠n Aquilu√© from Huesca. The failure of the insurrection led to his imprisonment in Torrero on January 3, 1931 and prosecution for a conspiracy offense. But, on March 4, during the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, the doors of the Torrero prison were opened and the prisoners were released. =Republic and civil war= During the time of the Second Republic he led an anti-religious campaign and defended Joan Garcia Oliver's theses on so-called \\"revolutionary gymnastics\\". On September 27, 1931, he participated in the Regional Congress of the CNT in Zaragoza, aligning himself with the maximalist theses of Joaqu√≠n Ascaso Budr√≠a, in favor of a revolutionary general strike. In 1932 he helped organize the constitution of the National Federation of Railway Industries (FNIF) of the CNT and provided propaganda support for the Alt Llobregat revolt. On July 13, 1935, he was arrested following the assassination of the scab leader at the Puente del Pilar works. After leaving prison he continued his propagandistic tasks, touring through different towns of Aragon and Navarre until July 1936. At the beginning of 1936, he met with the civilian governor of Zaragoza, √Ångel Vera Coronel, in order to obtain weapons in the event of a possible military coup, but he refused. At an assembly of militants in Zaragoza, his thesis, in favor of taking up arms by force, was defeated by that of Miquel Ab√≥s Serena, a supporter of negotiation. When the Spanish coup of July 1936 took hold of Zaragoza, he managed to escape to Casp and in October 1936 he took part in the constitution of the Regional Defense Council of Aragon, of which he was labor councilor, vice-president and delegate of the regional committee of the CNT. In March 1937, Chueca defended the Council of Defense of Aragon in the Regional Plenary session of Alca√±iz. He sided with the Friends of Durruti group, but after the fall of the Aragon front in April 1938 he was replaced in the Regional Committee and appointed political commissar of Machine Gun Battalion C, commanded by Agust√≠n Remiro Manero. =Exile and death= At the end of the Spanish Civil War he went into exile in France. In 1941 he settled in Montalban, where he worked as a lumberjack. Around 1942 he collaborated in the escape network of Francisco Ponz√°n Vidal, but was captured and interned in Camp Vernet. In 1944 he signed the constitution of the Junta Espa√±ola de Liberaci√≥n on behalf of the Spanish Libertarian Movement, and participated in numerous rallies in various Occitan cities. He was appointed secretary of propaganda of the CNT and advocated for organizing an alliance with the UGT. From 1945 to 1946 he was in charge of the CNT's treasury, but in 1948 he was expelled for participating in the pro-communist Congress of Vienna. Over the years he became blind and died in Paris when he was hit by a truck on October 18, 1966.

Flavio Bertelli was among the few exponents of divisionism in the Bolognese area, in addition to Augusto Majani and Alessandro Scorzoni. Furthermore, he belongs to that group of landscape painters of the early 1900s of the \\"Bolognese School of Painting\\", such as Luigi Bertelli (Flavio's father), Antonino Sartini, Guglielmo Pizzirani, Giovanni Secchi, Alessandro Scorzoni and Gino Marzocchi, who painted the Emilia-Romagna landscapes, reproducing their beauties and witnessing, with the brush, the changes over time.  Biography  Memoirs of Flavio Bertelli, written in his own hand and sent to his friend Antonino Sartini in 1932. Marina (seascape), 1921, Pinacoteca comunale di Faenza (Municipal Art Gallery of Faenza). Son of the painter Luigi Bertelli and Matilde Benetti, Flavio Bertelli was born in San Lazzaro di Savena in 1865. The family is wealthy and of a good cultural level: an uncle of Luigi Bertelli, Francesco Bertelli, is a professor of Astronomy at the University of Bologna; one of these sons, Timoteo Bertelli, is a Barnabite father of vast knowledge. He attended the college \\"Collegio di San Luigi\\" in Bologna and subsequently the college \\"Collegio Alle Querce\\" in Florence, also attending the lessons of Telemaco Signorini, gaining admiration and affection for the teacher. The latter was the painter who had met Manet and Degas personally, he was the most open mind of the whole Macchiaioli movement. Back in Bologna, in 1883 he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts where he remained for only one year, despite the victory of two medals. In 1885 he abandoned his studies to devote himself to painting and at only twenty-three he participated in the National Exhibition of \\"Belle Arti\\" (fine Arts) in Bologna. In 1891 he exhibited the painting Nevicata (snowfall) at the first \\"Triennale di Brera\\" (triennial exhibition of Brera) and probably on this occasion he met Vittore Grubicy de Dragon with whom he shared the principles of divisionism. In that same year, following the failure of the family brickyard, Flavio is in a very difficult economic condition. Forced to leave the family home, he moves to an attic of Palazzo Bentivoglio in Bologna, where he later meets Alfredo Baruffi and becomes part of the cenacle of the \\"Giambardi della Sega\\", with whom he will share the brief experience of the \\"Academia (academy) de la Lira\\". He exhibited at the second \\"Triennale di Brera\\" (triennial exhibition of Brera) obtaining great success with critics and in 1895 he took part in the exhibition of the \\"Society of Francesco Francia\\", which he would continue to take part in until 1922. Sera, (Evening) 1898, oil on canvas, 150x300 cm, private collection. In 1898 at the National Exhibition of Turin he presented the great pointillist painting Sera (evening). In 1900 he left Palazzo Bentivoglio to move his studio to via del Poggiale. In the same year he collaborated in the illustration of the magazine \\"Italia ride\\" (Italy laughs) and refused the important proposal of the publisher Giulio Ricordi to illustrate musical scores. In 1903 he took part in the LXII Exhibition of the Turin by Societ√† Promotrice delle Belle Arti (Promoting Society of fine Arts) and in 1905 he took care of the decoration of the baptistery of the church of S. Ansano in Pieve del Pino (near Bologna). In 1909 he was appointed academic by the Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna (Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna). In 1915 he finished the painting Oltre il Pincio, considered by critics to be his masterpiece, which cost him years of effort. Authenticated copy of Flavio Bertelli's will in 1933. His passion for divisionism comes to fruition and ends with the spiritual crisis of 1918 . In fact, the strong depressive crisis will convince him to abandon the Divisionist technique which requires maximum concentration and long times. Bertelli recovers the post Macchiaioli painting learned in the Florentine years. In 1921 he participated in the 1st Roman Biennial exhibition and in the \\"Fiorentina primaverile\\". During the twenties Flavio made several trips between the Italian regions Romagna and the Marche: he stayed in Carpegna, in Montefeltro, in Monghidoro, Pennabilli, Modigliana, Gabicce and Cattolica. In these years he paints many works that he gives to his friends in exchange for hospitality. We know from them that Flavio was a kind and welcome guest: they remember him as a pleasant pianist, a lovable, cultured and reserved person. Sartini), in which he expresses his gratitude towards Sartini. Telegram sent by Flavio Bertelli to his friend Antonino Sartini on 23/01/1941 In 1929 he was hit by a new very serious depressive crisis. Hospitalized in a private clinic, he is forced to leave prematurely because he is unable to pay the costs. He then leaves his studio in \\"via del Poggiale\\" and is first a guest in Crespellano by his friend and painter Antonino Sartini, who improvises himself as a merchant to sell him the paintings accumulated over many years and at the same time he convinces him to go back to painting. In 1933 he moved to Cagnona di Bellaria in a humble house with his sister Amalia. During these years he is supported by friends who provide him with the tools and deal with the sale of the paintings. Among these we find his friend and painter Antonino Sartini who continues to help and support him. However, there are others who from Bologna bring brushes, colors and other materials as gifts to the painter, in order to buy Bertelli's paintings at an extremely low price, leaving very little profit margin to the artist. On December 29, 1941, at the age of seventy-six, Flavio Bertelli died of a gastric neoplasm at the Rimini Hospital. He is buried in the monumental cemetery of the Certosa di Bologna. However, it is reported in the catalog of the Bertelli Flavio retrospective exhibition of 1952, 1981 and 1991 that: \\"Il Circolo Artistico di Bologna (The Artistic Circle of Bologna), in the decade of the artist's death, allocates a sum to transport the remains of Flavio Bertelli to Bologna. But arrives late: the bones of Flavio are now confused with those of other poor people in a mass grave in the Rimini Cemetery \\". In fact, the same Circolo Artistico di Bologna (Artistic Circle of Bologna) wrote in 1952 that: \\"It was intended to recover the remains of the body, buried in a common field of the cemetery of Rimini, before they were confused with others in the ossuary, and to give them perpetual distinction in our Certosa ... The intervention of the Club did not come in time to save the bones from dispersion ... \\".  Style  Flavio Bertelli was one of the main representatives of Bolognese divisionism. Among the most significant pointillist works we remember: Paesaggio (Landscape) (1891), Sera (evening) (1898) and Oltre il Pincio (1915). The depressive crisis of 1918 was followed by the gradual abandonment of the pointillist technique in favor of the recovery of the stain painting learned in the Florentine years by Telemaco Signorini. In the Thirties the painting evaporates becoming less material and letting the support shine through without ever losing the lyricism typical of all his production.

The painting was completed at some time between 1610 and 1626. It is currently part of the private collection of the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. Painting Mountain Landscape with Pilgrims in a Grotto Chapel was completed in the early 17th century, possibly in 1616. The focal point of the painting is its grotto motif. Grottoes were one of the recurrent themes in Flemish landscape painting. Many paintings by de Momper which feature a grotto have survived to this day. Momper's grotto-landscape painting derives from the trend popularized by Cornelis van Dalem. His grottoes provide a retreat for herdsmen, monks and saints, or serve as meeting places for Greek Mythological characters. In this case, the grotto serves as a haven for pilgrims, who gather there to stay a while and offer up prayers. De Momper often collaborated with other artists for the realization of staffage figures, notably Jan Brueghel the Elder. In this painting the staffage was painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder.

From 1934 to 1935, he was a member of the National Committee of the CNT and a delegate of the FNIF to the Congress of Madrid in 1935. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War caught him in Valencia, where he befriended Enric Marco Nadal and joined the Regional Defence Council of Aragon as head of transport and communications. He represented the CNT in the Committee of Line Operations, and he represented Aragon and Navarre in the National Defence Council. At the end of the civil war he was taken prisoner in Alicante and sent to Aranjuez, where on November 13, 1940, he was sentenced to death in a very brief council of war. However, he was not executed and was finally released on March 14, 1946 under pardon. Based in Madrid, in 1947 he agreed to represent the CNT in the governments of the Spanish Republican government in exile, so he escaped to France and from there to Mexico, where he arrived on March 17, 1947. There he was appointed Minister of Information in the second government of Rodolfo Llopis. He was part of the CNT sector in favor of collaborating with the republican authorities in exile. He later emigrated to Venezuela, where in 1960 he participated in the CNT Reunification Congress. On February 13, 1962, he died of a heart attack.

Without maternal recognition to maintain pregnancy, the initial messengers which stop luteolysis and promote foetal implantation, growth and uterine development finish with nothing to replace them and the pregnancy is lost. Pregnancy maintenance relies on the continued production of Progesterone which is initially produced by the Corpus luteum (CL). A hormone secreting structure that develops on the ovary after ovulation. Maternal recognition of pregnancy differs between species, however they all include a signal to prevent luteolysis, which then prevents the resumption of menstrual or oestrous cycles. Luteolysis is the regression of the corpus luteum. The process is identified by the decline of progesterone and it signifies the absence of pregnancy following ovulation. In the non pregnant uterus, the decline of progesterone allows the return of oestrogen, resulting in the upregulation of oxytocin receptors and consequently pulsatile release of PGF2Œ±. In turn, luteolysis is induced. This regression allows the continuation of the menstrual cycle. However, if pregnancy is established, luteolysis is evaded via maternal recognition of pregnancy because high levels of progesterone are maintained by the CL and the placental hormone hCG further maintains the CL.  Mechanisms of recognition  = Human = Progesterone release from the CL is promoted by Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) produced by the cells of the trophoblast, the outer layer of cells present on the early embryo. = Sheep and Cow = In most ruminant species, interferon tau has been identified as the signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy . Interferon tau is therefore also referred to as an anti luteolytic factor, essential for the maintenance of the corpus luteum. Interferon tau is secreted by the trophectoderm of the blastocyst from around day 10 in ovine species and from day 15 in bovine species. Interferon tau acts on the endometrial cells of the maternal uterus to prevent the production of the luteolytic factor, PGF2…ë. The inhibition of PGF2…ë production is the result of a change in gene expression. Interferon tau inhibits the transcription of the oxytocin receptor gene in both sheep and cows, and also the oestrogen receptor …ë gene in sheep. The absence of these receptors in the cells of the endometrium prevents the pulsatile release of PGF2…ë.

It was built in 1910 to serve as Glen Carbon's first village hall. The village was founded in 1892, and its government met in various businesses and public buildings until the village's growth necessitated a permanent building. The Oswald Brothers of nearby Alhambra built the Neoclassical building. The village government occupied the upper level of the building, while its fire department used the lower level. The village hall was the site of several contentious events in the 1910s; one village trustee won a tied election by pulling a number from a hat, and village president Hiram Slinger, Jr., had his nominees for village treasurer unanimously rejected by the trustees seventeen times. The village government moved to the former Glen Carbon Grade School in 1954, and the fire department moved to a new firehouse in 1981; the building is now used as meeting space by a model railroad club and a local Boy Scout troop. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 19, 2018.

Early life  Bannister is the eldest son of Sir Roger Bannister, an eminent neurologist and middle-distance athlete who ran the first sub four-minute mile (died 3 March 2018) and Moyra Jacobsson, a Swedish artist. He grew up in London and was educated between 1972 and 1975 at University College School in Hampstead and then at Oxford University (1977‚Äì80), where he studied PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) at Exeter College. At Oxford he produced a number of theatrical productions.  Career  He began his career as a banker with First National Bank of Boston (1981‚Äì1984) in Boston and London, focusing on specialist debt and equity lending to the cable TV and film business. Subsequently, he joined Booz Allen & Hamilton as an associate in 1984. He became a partner in 1990. He focused on a broad range of strategic, financial and operating projects with numerous financial institutions working in Ireland, France, USA, Australia, UK and Saudi Arabia. = HSBC Group plc = In 1994 he joined HSBC Investment Bank as director for strategic planning. In 1996 he moved to New York to be the deputy CEO of HSBC Investment Bank in the US, Canada and Latin America. He then worked directly with the executive chairman, Sir John Bond, on developing a new strategy for the HSBC Group ‚Äì entitled Managing for Value in 1998. This strategy, introduced the global HSBC brand, risk adjusted capital measures, group client segmentation and set wealth/insurance priorities. In 1999 Bannister was made CEO of Group Private Banking. = Phoenix Group plc = Bannister as the Phoenix Group CEO in 2019. Under the chairmanship of Ron Sandler (2009‚Äì2011), Bannister was recruited in 2011 and charged with the business turnaround. In 2008, the Pearl Group (renamed Phoenix Group in 2010) had acquired Resolution plc for ¬£5bn to create the UK's largest \\"runoff\\" (Zombie) life fund consolidator. Due to adverse macroeconomic conditions and excessive short-term bank debt, Phoenix faced significant financial challenges. Working with three subsequent chairmen, Sir Howard Davies (2012‚Äì15), Henry Staunton (2015-18) and Nicholas Lyons (2018‚Äìpresent), Bannister led a financial restructuring, a business repositioning and then a period of acquisition-led growth. Financial stability was achieved by the sale of an annuities book of business to Guardian (2012), the sale of the IGNIS asset management to Standard Life (2014) and a ¬£200m unrated bond issue (2014); which permitted the repayment of short-term bank debt. Between 2011 and 2020 Phoenix's leverage declined from 68% to 27%. The business moved from being a pure ‚Äúclosed‚Äù life company, reinforced by three acquisitions (2016 Axa Wealth's pension & protection business, 2016 Abbey Life, 2020 ReAssure). It diversified into writing open business through the acquisition of Standard Life Assurance in 2018 and built a bulk purchase annuity capability. Under Bannister's tenure, Phoenix's market capitalisation increased from ¬£1.0bn to ¬£7.0bn; and joined the FTSE 100 in 2018. In 2020 it employs 7500, it has 14 million policyholders with ¬£325bn AUM. Bannister retired from Phoenix in 2020. = Museum of London = Bannister was appointed chair of the Museum of London by Boris Johnson in 2013 and reappointed in 2017 by Sadiq Khan to a second four-year term in office. Its 19-strong board is drawn from elected members of the City of London Corporation and nominated members from the Greater London Authority. Funding from both these institutions, plus the Arts Council England (ACE) supports the museum. During his tenure the museum has curated exhibitions including: The Cheapside Hoard; Fire Fire!; Sherlock Holmes; Crime; The Hidden Rivers of London and Roman Dead.  Personal life  Bannister married American-born Marjorie Jean Barfuss (Connecticut) in April 1992 and they have three sons. Bannister has lived in west London since 1990. He enjoys running and cycling, but his primary pastimes are carpentry (marquetry) and restoring classic cars.

It is part of German hymnals, and was translated as \\"O God Almighty Father\\" and \\"Sing Praise to Our Creator\\". \\"All Praise and Glad Thanksgiving\\" is sung to the same hymn tune. \\"Gott Vater, sei gepriesen\\" appeared first in 1838 in a hymnal in Limburg, then in Mainz in 1902. The topic is praise of the Trinity, combined with prayers in different matters. No author nor composer of the melody is known. The song is part of regional sections of the German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob, such as in Limburg as GL 792 (without the sixths stanza), in Fulda as GL 795, and in Mainz as GL 869. The text is in seven stanzas of eight lines each, with the last four lines a refrain of praise following the model of the Trisagion. It begins \\"Heiliger dreieinger Gott, Licht im Leben, Heil im Tod\\" (Holy triune God, light in life, salvation in death) and end with the call to praise and thank forever. The first stanza calls to praise the three persons of the Trinity. The second stanza, \\"Vers√∂hne, was gespalten\\" (Reconcile what is divided), is focused on unity in Christianity. The third stanza prays for wisdom given to leaders. The fourth stanza prays for peace in the world, and walking on paths of peace with determination day by day (\\"und Tag f√ºr Tag entschieden des Friedens Wege gehn\\"). \\"O God Almighty Father\\" was written by Irvin M. Udulutsch and published in 1959. It is in four stanzas, and not a translation of the German hymn. The refrain of his version begins \\"O most holy Trinity, undivided unity\\".

He began to preach after exhorting the people while leading the psalm-singing. His Presbyterian principles brought him into opposition to the policies of the civil authorities. He refused The Black Oath and was pursued by those sent from Dublin to apprehend non swearers. He relocated to Scotland and was named multiple times and threatened with severe punishment throughout his life including shortly before his death in his 75th year. Entry into ministry John Semple was sometime precentor in a church in County Down. He is said to have been called to the ministry under the following circumstances. It was then the custom to begin divine service with praise, and this continued until the minister had entered the pulpit. On one occasion when a preacher was late in arriving, Semple \\"had an impulse\\" to expound the psalm which had been sung, and did it very well. He was shortly afterwards permitted to go on exhorting in private houses, and had many people to hear him in different parts of the country. The Black Oath Deputy Strafford, then ruling in Ireland, sought to please Charles I. Two Scottish viscounts (Ards and Claneboy), in the North ‚Äî on whose lands many of the Presbyterian ministers and people had dwelt, ‚Äî found themselves and estates in hazard. And to vindicate them that they had no hand in the business of Scotland, there was an oath framed to be imposed on all the Ulster-Scots over 16 years of age in the country as a test of their loyalty. They were required to abhor National Covenant in Scotland, or any such thing, and obey the King's royal commands. This oath, called by the people \\"the Black Oath,\\" was (it is said) framed by these two noblemen, and recommended by the Lord Deputy to be urged by authority on the country ‚Äî which was done with all rigour from 21 May 1639. The generality did take it who were not bound with a conscience; others hid themselves or fled, leaving their houses, and goods; and divers were imprisoned and kept in various gaols for a considerable time. Upon refusing the oath, candidates had their names returned to Dublin, from where 'pursuivants' were sent to apprehend those who were deemed disloyal. Several were apprehended and taken prisoners to Dublin. Others, though sent for, escaped the pursuivants who were most earnest to apprehend them. John Semple is recorded to have been nearly captured by the pursuivants several times, but to have escaped despite numerous close shaves with the law. Carsphairn ministry John Semple became minister of Carsphairn in Kirkcudbrightshire in 1646, and joined the Protesters in 1651. M'Crie records that, Oliver Cromwell, \\"marching into a meeting of the ministers in Edinburgh on one occasion, he made a harangue to them nearly an hour in length, in his usual style of rhapsody, and copiously interlarded with quotations from Scripture. The members looked at each other in bewildered amazement, till at length an old minister, Mr. John Semple of Carsphairn, rose up and said : \\"Moderator, I hardly know what the gentleman wald be at in this long discourse; but one thing I am sure of, he was perverting the Scripture.\\" For this speech the honest minister was punished by six months' imprisonment.\\" On 23 August 1660 he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle by order of the Committee of Estates, who also sequestrated his stipend, 25 September following. He was included in the list of rebels whom the lieges were prohibited from receiving, 4 December 1666, and in a list of those who were to be prosecuted, 15 August 1667, as well as in the list of those to whom pardon and indemnity were granted, 1 October following. At the request of Alexander, Viscount Kenmure, he was granted indulgence at Carsphairn on 3 September 1672. He was fined on 10 July 1673, for not observing the anniversary of the Restoration. When cited before the Privy Council on 4 August 1677, and threatened with death or banishment, he replied, \\"He is abune [above] that guides the gully [knife]; my God will not let you either kill me or banish me, but I will go home and die in peace.\\" He returned, preached in the parish, and died soon afterwards, aged 75. He left a considerable sum of money to the poor of Kirkcudbright. Family John Semple had a wife who was six years his senior. Neither her name nor any children are listed in Wodrow.

The painting was completed in the 1610s, possibly in 1616. It is currently housed at the art gallery of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Painting The painting depicts a massive grotto. Grottoes were one of the favorite themes of de Momper, and they figure in many of his paintings. Cornelis van Dalem's work influenced de Momper in the choice of this subject. In the foreground, a man is sitting with his back against a stone, while two horsemen are sitting on their mounts and looking up to the viewer's right. One of them is flanked by a dog. The other is pointing up to the natural features of the grotto. Momper's paintings regularly feature exotic and mountainous topography, and such is the case of Landscape with Grotto and a Rider. He made use of his memory and imagination to produce foreign vistas with fantastic physical features and glimpses of exotic topography from his studio in Antwerp, Flanders. While paintings by de Momper and the group of Flemish painters following the same trend may seems old- fashioned and are indeed less realistic than the product of the landscape painting of other 17th-century painters, they evince a more experienced, personal and imaginative approach to landscape painting. Although far less frequently than in Brueghel, they may present allegory, and were painted this way so as to please the sophisticated tastes of the wealthy commissioners, who paid a higher price for the \\"imaginative landscape paintings.\\" Provenance The painting was part of the collection of Count Hermann Otto I of Limburg- Styrum, and later came in the possession of Amsterdam based collector Piet de Boer.

The Saint Nicholas Church is a ruined medieval church at the village of Khopi (Khuap) in Abkhazia, an entity in the South Caucasus with a disputed political status. It is located some 18 km northwest of the town of Gudauta, at the foot of the Bzyb Range. The extant structure is a remnant of a hall church, probably built in the period of the 10th-12th century and covered by dense foliage. No contemporary historical records mention it. In 1967, while exploring the ruins, the art historian Leo Shervashidze found a limestone slab carrying a partially damaged Georgian inscription in the medieval asomtavruli script arranged in 14 lines around a Maltese-type cross carved in relief. The extant text relates that the church was constructed in the reign of King George around the time when Gurandukht was born, imploring St. Nicholas's intercession before the Christ. Based on the context and epigraphic features of the inscription, this king George is variously identified as George II of Abkhazia () by Leo Shervashidze, George I of Georgia () by Teimuraz Barnaveli, or George III of Georgia () by Vladimer Silogava and Andrey Vinogradov and Denis Beletsky. All these monarchs had a daughter named Gurandukht.  References  External links *Khopi Saint Nicholas Church. Historical monuments of Abkhazia ‚Äî Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia.

He was Director of the Dunn Nutritional Laboratory (now the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit) in Cambridge, UK, from its foundation in 1927 until his retirement in 1963. He was instrumental in setting up the (British) Nutrition Society, and the International Union of Nutrition Societies. His research focused primarily on vitamins, including developing the saturation test for assessing vitamin C levels in a urine sample, and showing that vitamins A and D are harmful in excess.  Education and early life  Harris was born in Liverpool, the second son of pacifist rabbi John Solomon Harris. He was educated at Liverpool College and Manchester University where he studied science.  Career and research  Harris was a research student under Cambridge biochemist Frederick Gowland Hopkins. His Ph.D thesis (1923) was Titration of amino- and carboxyl- groups in amino-acids. In 1927 Harris was chosen as Director of the newly founded Dunn Nutritional Laboratory, a joint undertaking of the University of Cambridge and the Medical research council. His work at the Dunn concentrated on studies of the effects of deficiency and excess of vitamins A, B, C, and D in animals and humans, and the effects of preserving food on its dietary value. Harris‚Äô research included the saturation test for assessing vitamin C levels in urine samples; showing that vitamins A and D are harmful in excess; and characterizing B complex vitamins in collaboration with Egon Kodicek, his successor as Unit director. He authored several books on vitamins, including the popular Vitamins in Theory and Practice. During and after World War II, Harris advised the British government on nutrition, directing work in methods of preserving foods without loss of vitamins, and ensuring that rations supplied adequate vitamin levels. In 1941 he was one of the founder members of the Nutrition Society of which he served as the first secretary, and later president. In 1946 he helped to set up the International Union of Nutrition Societies, of which he was secretary-general from 1946 to 1960.  Personal life  In 1927 he married Rosie Snowman, daughter of Jacob Snowman. They had two sons: Michael Harris (born 1929), a medical doctor, and John Harris (born 1932), a physicist.

He was the president of the Hospitality Union of the CNT, and later became secretary of the CNT's Regional Defense Committee during the Spanish Civil War. Under his command was Cipriano Mera, with whom he managed to stop the coup attempt in Cuenca. He endeavored to transform the Confederate Militias into disciplined military divisions. On March 5, 1939, the National Defence Council was constituted, to separate Juan Negr√≠n and the Communists from power and to negotiate an end to the war. General Miaja trusted Val, being one of his advisers during the defense of Madrid and one of the best informed of what was happening on the Central and Southern fronts. Thus Eduardo Val joined the council as head of Communications and Public Works, representing the CNT. After the defeat he first went into exile in England and later moved to France, where he was captured by the Nazis and began a tortuous journey through various concentration camps. He eventually escaped and joined the 9th Leclerc Company, the first to enter Paris. He never returned to Spain, he instead went to Argentina, where he continued his political activity, acting as a representative of the bakers' guild. Despite being in exile from Spain, he was nevertheless prosecuted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Special Tribunal for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism. Later released, he continued his activity in the naval guild. The last survivor of the National Defense Council, Eduardo Val died in 1992.

An ablation study studies the performance of an AI system by removing certain components, to understand the contribution of the component to the overall system. The term is by analogy with biology (removal of components of an organism), and, continuing the analogy, is particularly used in the analysis of artificial neural nets, by analogy with ablative brain surgery. Ablation studies require that the system exhibit graceful degradation: that they continue to function even when certain components are missing or degraded. History The term is credited to Allen Newell, who used it in his 1974 tutorial on speech recognition, published in . The term is by analogy with ablation in biology. The motivation was that, while individual components are engineered, the contribution of an individual component to the overall system performance is not clear; removing components allows this analysis.

Alton had gotten its electricity from coal power until this point, and the hydroelectric plant helped lower energy costs in the city. The plant went online in 1915 and served as the city's primary power plant until 1928, when a series of mergers and reorganizations resulted in the Union Electric Company, which had also bought the Keokuk hydroelectric plant, purchasing the plant from Alton Gas & Electric. After 1928, the station only served as an emergency backup for Union Electric's other substations, and it closed for good in 1937.

It is located 3 km north-west of the village, on a small mountainous plateau locally known as Sagergaio on the right bank of the Okumi river, north of the town of Gali. The extant church is a hall-church design, heavily rebuilt in the late 19th century, on a medieval site of Christian worship. It is built of coarsely cut rubble stone and white rectangular limestone slabs. The floor was also once faced with similar slabs, but only its portion survives at the sanctuary. A belfry, now in ruins, is attached to the west wall of the church. The apse is covered with a simple dome-like roof and is pierced with three arched windows. A pair of similar windows is found each, on the southern and northern walls. Archaeological digs on the site in the 1980s unearthed two construction layers, the upper one completely covered with foliage, with roots going down to the ceiling. It is what remains of a possibly 15th-century small hall church, measuring 4.5 m x 7.5 m. The lower layer was buried in debris and occupied by remnants of a single-nave hall-church-type edifice with the dimensions of 12 x 14 m. The hall had a rectangular plan, with an eastern apse inscribed in it and had its interior divided into two with a stepped pilasters. Fragments of ornate wall masonry were also found in this layer. Not far from the church, a Georgian inscription, cut in stone in medieval asomtavruli script, was found in 1955 and brought to a museum in Sukhumi. Paleographically dated to the 11th century, it reads: \\"God, have mercy in both lives upon the builder of this church, the Queen of Queens, Sagdukht, daughter of Niania. Amen!\\" The identity of Sagdukht remains obscure.  References  External links * Ghumurishi Church. Historical monuments of Abkhazia ‚Äî Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia.

She was also a writer, being the first Portuguese actress to write her memoirs, a teacher, translator and journalist, as well as a volunteer nurse in World War I. Early life Mercedes Blasco was born on 4 September 1867 (some sources say 1870) in the mining community of Mina de S. Domingos, located in the Alentejo region of Portugal, from where her mother's family came. When she was a few months old her family moved to Huelva in Spain, where her father was a train driver and where they lived until she was seven, when the family moved to the city of Porto in Portugal. She was brought up from a very early age with the idea that she would have a career in medicine and also mastered several foreign languages, which she would use frequently in her professional life. Beginning of theatrical career Having studied in Porto as a primary school teacher, Blasco began her theatrical career in 1888 at the Teatro Chalet in Porto, having run away from home. At that time she used the pseudonym, Judith Mercedes. She then moved to what was then the Teatro do Pr√≠ncipe Real in that city. With her reputation preceding her, she went to Lisbon and played at the Teatro do Rato, before returning to Porto. Coming from a conservative background, she chose to use pseudonyms to avoid social stigma. Her daring costumes and provocative roles would give rise to a series of scandals during her career. She returned to Lisbon in 1890 to join the company of the Teatro da Trindade. Her first performance there was in a vaudeville called Mademoiselle Nitouche. She also performed in operettas at the same theatre. In 1891, also at the Trindade, she performed in the play, Miss Helyett, considered by many to have been her best performance. At this time she also began to perform songs in French, to great acclaim. Scandal In 1892‚Äì93, she moved briefly to the Teatro Avenida in Lisbon. Back at the Trindade she played in the operetta S√° de Albergaria. In this she sang Portuguese fados that she had composed. On one occasion the audience called her back for ten encores. Despite further successes at this theatre she returned to Porto when Ant√≥nio de Sousa Bastos became the director of the Trindade and married her professional rival Palmira Bastos. Back in Lisbon in 1897 she caused scandal by bicycling from her home to the theatre, the first woman to use a bicycle in Lisbon. In the same year she went to Brazil with the Sousa Bastos company. In 1897, she joined Pedro Cabral's company, installed at the 4000-seat Coliseu dos Recreios in which she had several successes. Among these was Farroncas do Z√© (1898) in which Blasco played 14 roles, among them the controversial Princess of Caraman-Chimay, in which she wore a Parisian maillot or leotard, the first time such a garment had been worn on a Portuguese stage. Many people considered it obscene. She also worked at the Teatro da Trindade between 1897 and 1903, also performing at the Teatro D. Am√©lia (now known as the Teatro S√£o Luiz). Additionally, she organized a company of her own for a tour of Portuguese provinces. In 1901, Blasco became pregnant, the father being the journalist Augusto Peixoto, with whom she was living. She performed while being pregnant, wearing clothes designed to disguise the pregnancy. She visited Madrid at the invitation of the Teatro Romea, where she performed French and Neapolitan songs, a repertoire that she repeated at the Teatro Marquez in Cartagena. The pregnancy added to her reputation for scandal, which was not diminished by her performance in 1902‚Äì03 in the show √Ä Busca do Badalo (Searching for the clapper), the title of which, after seventy-five performances, was pronounced obscene, with the authorities enforcing a name change. She gave birth for a second time in 1905. Travels In 1908 Blasco published a book entitled Mem√≥rias de uma actriz (Memories of an actress). The premature publication of a memoir, while still at the height of her career, was unusual but her notoriety meant that the book sold very well. Around this time Blasco began to undertake more frequent overseas trips. At the beginning of 1908 she went to Rio de Janeiro for the Brazilian National Exposition, where she had considerable success. She then went directly to Paris to begin a long season of touring that took in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium. Her fluency in several languages served her well during the tour and she became very popular with members of several royal families, being asked to give command performances. Blaso performing at the London Coliseum in 1909 World War I When World War I broke out she was living in Belgium, where she had married a Belgian electrical engineer, Remi Ghekiere. Her two sons, Stelio and Marcelo were with her. During World War I, she enlisted as a nurse with the Red Cross, and treated and helped repatriate Portuguese soldiers in Li√®ge in 1918. She also did some teaching. In her book Vagabunda Mercedes she recounted the difficulties she experienced in Brussels during the war because she refused to perform before the German forces. At the end of the war Blasco returned to Lisbon as a widow with few resources. She found it difficult to find work on the stage as her age did not match the daring artistic performances that had made her famous as a young woman. Stelio had died in Brussels and the other son, Marcelo, was already very ill and was to die in June 1922 of tuberculosis. In the last months of her son's life they both lived on a small pension granted by the civil governor of Lisbon and on the meagre royalties from her books. Final years As a means of support, she continued to write, eventually producing more than thirty works, consisting of autobiographies, novels, plays, and translations. In Vagabunda Mercedes she inserted a ‚Äúfeminist chapter‚Äù, advocating women's cultural and economic emancipation, universal suffrage, and equality between the sexes. She also worked as a journalist, writing for Lisbon newspapers O S√©culo, A Capital, A Ilustra√ß√£o, and O Di√°rio de Lisboa. However, the returns from writing were small and she lived a life of some poverty, particularly when compared with how she had lived as an actor. She was forced to live off the charity of some friends, such as the owner of a pastry shop in the Chiado district of Lisbon, who would not charge her for her meals. She began to have mental difficulties, on one occasion leaving home and wandering all over Lisbon until the police found her and took her to a care home from where she was collected by relatives. She died in Lisbon on 12 April 1961 at a friend's house where she had been living for over a year. She is buried in Lisbon's Prazeres Cemetery in the zone reserved for artists. A plaque identifying the plot was inserted in 2017, on the 150th anniversary of her birth.

It stars Graham Sibley, Marguerite Insolia, and Ajay Mehta, and was narrated by Cedric the Entertainer. An initial cut of the film premiered at the 2018 Sunscreen Film Festival in St. Petersburg, Florida. Comedy Dynamics released the film via multiple digital platforms on August 11, 2020. Plot A writer from New York named Greg Drowning falls in love with a new tenant renting a room in his Los Angeles home. Development Poor Greg Drowning was adapted from director Jeffrey Scott Collins's short film Glimpses of Greg, and some footage from the short film was used in the feature. Collins mainly filmed Poor Greg Drowning on weekends. The animated sequences in the film were created by animator Steven Kamakanda, and were inspired by Collins' drawing of Greg as a stick figure used as a title card for Glimpses of Greg. The sequences were added after an early cut Poor Greg Drowning had played at festivals, with Cedric the Entertainer, who Collins worked with on Why Him?, agreeing to narrate the scenes. Some of the dialogue was improved by the actors on-set. The soundtrack was composed by Nicole Churchill, although Collins chose not to use music in several key dramatic moments throughout the film, as he felt it may distract from the comedy. Filming began in June of 2015 and ended in September 2016, and the film was shot with a small crew. After the early cut played at festivals, the final cut of the film was completed in March 2020. As the crew did not have a dedicated props department, they needed to mix together an assortment of foods in the kitchen at the location where they were filming to create the fake vomit for the scene where Greg vomits over his trainer‚Äôs feet. The final scenes in the film were filmed over a period of six days after the crew received additional funding to finish principle photography. It was confirmed on April 27, 2020 that Comedy Dynamics had acquired Poor Greg Drowning and would release the film onto video on demand services on August 11. Reception David Gelmini of Cultured Vultures awarded Poor Greg Drowning a score of 8 out of 10, praising the screenplay and the performances of the cast, and calling the film a ‚Äúmoving and powerful story about one man‚Äôs desperate attempt to find meaning and companionship in his life.‚Äù Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying ‚ÄúThe cast in this film is solid, and so is the directing.‚Äù It won the People's Choice for Best Feature Film at the 2019 Borrego Springs Film Festival. Best Comedy Feature at the Queens World Film Festival, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress awards at the Los Angeles Comedy Festival, and a Jury Prize at The Florida Comedy Film Festival.

The program After introductory comments from Ronald Reagan, the production began with Garland in the spotlight on a dark stage singing \\"I Feel a Song Coming On.\\" She then notes: \\"I have a feeling that there's much too much talk going on in the world today so you're going to get very little from me but I'm a singer and I just like to sing\\".

Not pictured: Carver, who is only available to the mage class. Dragon Age II, the second main video game in BioWare's Dragon Age series, features an ensemble cast of characters. The player fills the role of Hawke, a human who lived in the village of Lothering during the Blight in Ferelden. The overarching narrative of Dragon Age II chronicles Hawke's rise from an impoverished Ferelden refugee of the Fifth Blight to become the Champion of the city-state of Kirkwall in the Free Marches. The plot of Dragon Age II is a character-driven narrative which is more concerned with examining the interior worlds of distinct personalities instead of an epic, save-the-world storyline seen in other RPG games, and unfolds within a smaller chunk of the world of Thedas compared to the Warden's story in Origins. Concept and creation Dragon Age II implements a friendship-rivalry continuum for Hawke's relationships with his or her companions, which can be described as a system of evaluative continua by which Hawke's actions are assessed. These continua are specific to each companion, and often contradicts those of other companions, requiring the player to make gameplay decisions that may have the potential to cause conflicting and sometimes severe consequences. Unlike the approval-disapproval meters for companions in Origins, incurring rivalry points with a companion does not lead to the character leaving the party or turning on Hawke, although it is still possible for companions to leave the party as a result of certain decisions made by the player character throughout the game's narrative. A companion who is on a rivalry path with Hawke gets unique gameplay bonuses that cannot be obtained if they are on a friendship path, and vice versa. Former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider explained that the friendship- rivalry meter is expressive, not something that a player needs to fill up in order to be playing the game correctly. With the exception of Sebastian Vael, who is the sole heterosexual love interest, all other potential love interests in Dragon Age II are bisexual and available for either a male or female Hawke. Gaider admitted that making a romance available for both genders is far less costly than creating an entirely new one. Hawke Class: Player's choice Gender: Player's choice : Voiced by: Nicholas Boulton (Male) and Jo Wyatt (Female) Hawke is the family name of the main protagonist of Dragon Age II. Hawke's father Malcolm was an apostate mage who died three years before the beginning of the game, while their mother Leandra is a former noblewoman from Kirkwall. Hawke has two younger twin siblings, Carver and Bethany, who are mutually exclusive potential companions in Dragon Age. During character creation, the player decides Hawke's gender, appearance, given name, and later in the game, personality, combat specialization, and political affiliation. Unlike the Warden from the first game, Hawke's origin story is fixed and differs only slightly as a result of the class chosen. If played as a warrior or rogue, Hawke would have been part of King Cailan's army at Ostagar alongside Carver. If played as a mage, Hawke is an apostate mage who, like Malcolm and Bethany, has managed to evade the Chantry and it's templars while growing up in Lothering. The player is given paraphrased dialogue options of fully voiced dialogue via a radial command menu called the \\"dialogue wheel\\", which will be expanded on when clicked. Over the course of Dragon Age II, Hawke can exhibit one of three personalities based on the dialogue choices that the player favours. For example, a Hawke player character with a sarcastic personality has access to a big range of hilarious dialog options. The tone of Hawke's voice will be decided by their personality type whenever the character is not directly controlled by the player, which will happen during cut-scenes and also during conversations between the player's dialogue choices. Hawke, along with their surviving family members and Aveline Vallen, were rescued from the darkspawn hordes by Flemeth, who helped them to arrange for travel to Kirkwall; in return, Hawke has to travel to Sundermount at some point in time to deliver an amulet to Marethari of the Sabrae clan. In Kirwall, the player will get to see Hawke's relationships with their mother, siblings, lovers and other characters develop over the length of a decade.  Companions  =Varric Tethras= : Voiced by: Brian Bloom Varric is a surface dwarf, a member of Dwarven merchant's guild and a known associate of Hawke. The video game's introduction shows him captured and interrogated by Cassandra Pentaghast, a Seeker of the Chantry; thus Varric becomes the narrator of the Dragon Age II story. Varric first meets Hawke roughly a year after the Hawke family has arrived in Kirkwall and makes them a partner in an expedition into the perilous region of The Deep Roads. They remain close friends or frenemies until the end of the game, when they are inevitably separated. Varric wields Bianca, a unique repeating crossbow. He likes storytelling, and he particularly likes taking liberties from factual accuracy to make his stories more interesting. =Bethany Hawke= : Voiced by: Rebekah Staton Bethany is a mage and one of the Hawke twins. She fled Lothering to escape the Blight with his family, and travels arrives to Kirkwall, where the City Guard is denying access to all Fereldan refugees. If Hawke is a mage, instead of Carver, Bethany will die protecting their mother from an Ogre as they flee the darkspawn onslaught of Lothering. If Bethany survives and is taken to the Deep Roads, she dies from contracting the Taint unless Anders is also in the party. To save Bethany's life, Anders will implore Hawke to search for a nearby group of Grey Wardens and persuades their leader, Stroud, to recruit her into the Grey Wardens. If left behind, Bethany is captured and forced into the Kirkwall Circle of Magi, though she will excel in her position as a Circle Mage. In either case, Bethany will not be available until the end of the game or during certain DLCs. Bethany employs magic in combat. Her specialty is Force Magic which involves the use of telekinesis to hurl, knock down, stun and harm enemies. =Carver Hawke= : Voiced by: Nico Lennon Carver is the elder of the Hawke twins and a warrior. Carver tends to have an antagonistic relationship with his elder sibling, due to their having taken over their father's role as head of the household after his death, and possibly due to Carver being the only non-magical child in the family. He fled Lothering to escape the Blight with his family, and travels arrives to Kirkwall, where the City Guard is denying access to all Fereldan refugees. If Hawke is a rogue or warrior, instead of Bethany, Carver will die protecting their mother from an Ogre as they flee the darkspawn onslaught of Lothering. If Carver survives and is taken to the Deep Roads expedition, he will contract the Taint and die unless Anders is also in the party. To save Carver's life, Anders will implore Hawke to search for a nearby group of Grey Wardens and persuades their leader, Stroud, to recruit him into the Grey Wardens. If he is left behind, he joins Kirkwall's Templar Order and remains resentful of his elder sibling. In either case, Carver will not be available until the end of the game or during certain DLC campaigns. Carver favours wielding two-handed weapons, and has access to the anti-magic combat specialization of the Templars, allowing him to prevent enemies from using special techniques. =Aveline Vallen= : Voiced by: Joanna Roth Aveline is the daughter of an exiled chevalier from Orlais who was born in Fereldan and served in the army of King Cailan before his death. She and her Templar husband Wesley meet the Hawkes on their flight from Lothering; Wesley dies during their escape in a mercy killing by either Hawke or Aveline to stop the Darkspawn taint from turning him into a ghoul. Aveline joins the Hawkes in escaping to Kirkwall, where she eventually becomes a member of city guard. She is later promoted to the Captain of the Guard after exposing the former Captain's corruption. During the course of the game, she falls in love with Donnic, a guardsman under her command, and can marry him with Hawke's encouragement. Donnic may appear as an ally in the final battle against Meredith, if Aveline is in the active party and if they are married. Aveline adopts her husband's shield during the Prologue and remains such throughout the game. Her specialization is Guardian, serving as a tank, attracting and absorbing hostile fire. Aveline is a companion with whom Hawke cannot initiate a romance. Gaider suggested that Aveline is his favourite character in Dragon Age 2. He explained that he likes characters \\"that play against type, and Aveline was a female character who was strong and independent yet also vulnerable, and at the same time she didn‚Äôt exist simply to be romanced\\". Aveline was well received. Cory Banks from PC Gamer named her as his favourite companion, as did Hayley Williams from Kotaku. Eric Chrisman from FanSided ranked Aveline eighth on his list of best BioWare companions. Kris Ligman from Pop Matter was amused by her adversarial relationship with Isabela, calling it part of an evolving rapport between two well-written female characters. Aveline's voice actress, Joanna Roth has been praised for her performance. =Anders= : Voiced by: Adam Howden A former Grey Warden, Anders left the Order prior to the events of Dragon Age II, and agreed to host the spirit of Justice to help mages fight for freedom from the Chantry. Hawke first meets Anders at his clinic in Kirkwall's Darktown. He convinces Hawke to help rescue his friend Karl from the templars in return for maps of the Deep Roads, but finds that he has been rendered Tranquil, effectively a form of lobotomy which renders the victim unable to feel any emotions. It is then revealed that the spirit of Justice now manifests itself as a spirit of Vengeance, an unintentional side effect of Anders' anger and hatred towards the templars. As a result, Anders struggles to maintain control of his own body and mind, and is eventually driven to become a terrorist in the name of mage rights. During the climax of Act III, Anders destroys the Kirkwall Chantry, killing the Grand Cleric and several others. Hawke has the option of personally executing Anders for his crime, banishing him, or ordering him to fight and make amends. Each companion will react to how Hawke chooses to deal with Anders in their own way, positive or negative. The spirit's final fate is unknown should Hawke choose to execute Anders during the climax of Act III. In Dragon Age II, Anders gains the ability channels the power of Vengeance to boost his own destructive power. =Merrill= : Voiced by: Eve Myles Merrill is the \\"First\\", or apprentice, to the Keeper of the Dalish Sabrae clan, Marethari. She first appears in the Dalish Elf origin story in Dragon Age: Origins, at a time when her clan was traveling through Ferelden. She joins the Dalish player character's party as a temporary companion. Shortly after Duncan recruits the Dalish player character, Merrill and her clan traveled north of Ferelden to escape the Blight and settled at Sundermount, a mountain peak to the north of Kirkwall. Merrill joins Hawke's party when Marethari, whom Hawke was dealing with due to a debt owed to Flemeth, requests that Hawke escort her to Kirkwall. Merrill's obsession with restoring an ancient magical mirror known as an Eluvian, believing it to be an artifact which could help the Dalish regains their lost history and culture, and her use of blood magic to do so have caused a rift between her and her clan, resulting in her desire to leave. Merrill's personal quest will involve her asking Hawke for favours to assist her with restoring the Eluvian. Merrill is a potential love interest for Hawke. Merrill uses magic in combat, and her specialization is \\"Dalish Pariah\\", a combination of nature magic and blood magic. Merrill is ignorant of the world beyond her rich knowledge and expertise of Dalish history and magic. =Isabela= : Voiced by: Victoria Kruger Isabela is the former captain of the pirate ship The Siren's Call, who is stranded in Kirkwall after being shipwrecked. She first appears as a minor non-player character in Origins who teaches the Warden the \\"Duelist\\" specialization, and is an optional companion and potential love interest in Dragon Age II. In Dragon Age II she is an optional companion for Hawke; her specialization is Swashbuckler, which improves her defensive abilities as well as effectiveness as an occasional tank. It is later revealed that Isabela is the main reason behind the Qunari's presence in Kirkwall, as she had stolen an important artifact from them. Depending on the player's choices, she may return to Hawke's side and hand the artifact back to the Arishok, supreme leader of the Qunari army. The Arishok will then demand that she be taken prisoner back to their homeland Par Vollen. Hawke can either hand Isabela over to him, duel the Arishok in single combat, or engage the entire Qunari force in combat. Isabela is a major character of the following digital comic series: Dragon Age: The Silent Grove, Dragon Age: Those Who Speak and Dragon Age: Until We Sleep. Those Who Speak exploring her background story. Kris Ligman from Pop Matters praised Isabela's depiction as a strong female character in Dragon Age II, citing an open discussion of finding one's self esteem during a banter conversation between Isabela and Aveline as a highlight of the game's \\"uncommonly complex messages and nuanced characterization\\", and that the character is capable of being a role model one could aspire to. =Fenris= : Voiced by: Gideon Emery Fenris is a Tevinter city elf and former slave; he is an optional companion and potential love interest. He lost his memory due to lyrium, a hazardous liquid substance with magical properties, being infused into his flesh, rendering him averse to physical contact but also giving him superhuman combat abilities. He escaped his master, a Tevinter magister named Danarius, and has been hunted by him ever since. Fenris is a brooding pessimist who is unable or unwilling to live a happy life; he has no memory of his past name, and resents mages due to the suffering he endured under Danarius. Over the course of Dragon Age II, he lives alone in an abandoned dilapidated mansion whose roof is in tatters and its floor strewn with corpses. His personal quest involves reconnecting with his sister Varania, and dealing with his former master's pursuit. Fenris employs two-handed melee weapons in combat. His specialization, Tevinter Fugitive, involves channeling the power of the imbued lyrium in his body to improve combat efficiency, allowing Fenris to move faster and do more damage as he gets hurt. Fenris appears as a major character in Dragon Age: Blue Wraith, a three-part limited comic series published by Dark Horse Comics in 2020. =Sebastian Vael= : Voiced by: Alec Newman Sebastian Vael is an optional companion introduced in Dragon Age II via the DLC pack, The Exiled Prince. An archer of noble birth, Sebastian was a cloistered brother of the Kirkwall Chantry until his family was murdered. Depending the player's choices throughout the three acts, Sebastian may remain as a Chantry brother or renounce his vows to attend political concerns. Sebastian is a romantic interest for a female Hawke only, but the relationship is chaste due to his vows to the Chantry.Following the destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry by Anders in Act III, Sebastian insists that Anders has committed mass murder and must be executed. If Hawke spares Anders, an enraged Sebastian leaves the party in protest, promising vengeance. If Hawke acquiesces, Sebastian stays as a party member. Sebastian uses bow and arrows as weapon. His specialization, Royal Archer, increases his combat effectiveness in one-on-one fights. Sebastian appears as a supporting character in Dragon Age: Knight Errant, a five-part limited comic series published by Dark Horse Comics in 2017. =Tallis= : Voiced by: Felicia Day Tallis is a temporary companion in the Dragon Age II DLC, Mark of The Assassin. She was an elven slave in the Tevinter Imperium until the Qunari liberated her and she converted to the Qun, where she was given several names before being assigned to the Ben-Hassrath as Tallis (Qunlat for \\"To Solve\\"). Tallis is a rogue character and uses daggers in combat. Unlike Isabela, Tallis also employs unique throwing knives for ranged attacks. Her combat specialty called Infiltrator allows her to win close quarter encounters with a single foe. Tallis only appears in main campaign of Mark of the Assassin DLC pack as a mandatory party member, and she leaves Hawke's party permanently after the DLC pack is completed. Tallis is voiced by and modeled after Felicia Day, who also stars as Tallis in the webseries Dragon Age: Redemption, a six-part webseries. Antagonists =Bartrand Tethras= : Voiced by: Keith Szarabajka Bartrand Tethras is Varric's elder brother, a merchant prince who organizes an expedition into the Deep Roads in Act I of Dragon Age II. He later betrays Varric and Hawke, abandoning them to their fates in the Deep Roads while he escapes to the surface. He is later driven insane by the red lyrium idol he recovered from the Deep Roads. =The Arishok= : Voiced by: Rick D. Wasserman The Arishok is the leader of the Qunari military branch, who is stranded in Kirkwall with his men, after their ship was wrecked in a storm chasing after the thief who stole their relic. Despite the Qunari's history as foreign occupiers, he states he has a demand to satisfy of their religion, the Qun and claims he has no intention of conquering Kirkwall. He is eventually sickened by the people who inhabit Kirkwall and after tensions between the Qunari and the residents of Kirkwall boil over, he decides to take the city by force and kills its Viscount. Hawke must deal with the Arishok, and earns the title of Champion of Kirkwall after resolving the Qunari crisis on behalf of the embattled city state. The Arishok's visual design was the favourite of the character artist team; team member Jae Keum was credited for designing the Qunari and their leader in such a way which captures the intensity of their stare as well as their essence as stern and noble warriors. =Petrice= : Voiced by: Christine Roberts Petrice is a Chantry Sister who ascends to the title of Mother by Act II of Dragon Age II. A religious extremist, she attempts to drive the Qunari out of Kirkwall by any necessary means; her schemes include setting Hawke up with a Qunari Saarebas mage named Ketojan, and murdering the Viscount's son Saemus Dumar who had converted to the Qun. =First Enchanter Orsino= : Voiced by: Jim Ward Orsino is the First Enchanter of the Circle of Magi in Kirkwall. He constantly clashes with Meredith over her treatment of mages and growing power in the city. Their most consistent topic of unrest is the thought that the mages use blood magic in secret. After Meredith invokes the Rite of Annulment, Orsino admits that he had ties to the deranged necromancer Quentin, who murdered Hawke's mother and several other women in Kirkwall. In desperation from the advancing Templars, he uses blood magic to use the dead bodies surrounded him to transform into a monstrous Harvester. He must be fought and killed by Hawke, regardless of which faction Hawke sides with. Reflecting on Orsino's role in the narrative of Dragon Age II, Gaider felt that it was a lost opportunity as Orsino ended up getting less screen time than necessary for his side of the story to be properly told. =Knight- Commander Meredith Stannard= :Voiced by: Jean Gilpin Meredith is the Knight- Commander of the Templar Order in Kirkwall and the chief antagonist of Dragon Age II. She holds extremist views on the control of magic, and is the ruler of Kirkwall in all but name; the Viscount of Kirkwall, Marlowe Dumar, dare not oppose her. Following Dumar's death, Meredith assumes direct control over the city, and prevents any vote to elect a new Viscount to proceed. Kirkwall quickly becomes a police state that Meredith rules with an iron fist, giving free rein to her cronies amongst the Order to do as they please in abusing the mages and dominating the civilian population of the city. As the game progresses, she suffers from paranoid delusions that all members of the Circle of Magi are blood mages and all who defy her are under their influence. During the climax of the game, Anders blows up the Kirkwall Chantry and openly announces his culpability. The destruction of the Chantry gave her the opportunity to unilaterally invoke the Rite of Annulment, an order to kill every member of the Kirkwall's Circle of Magi, without official sanction from a Grand Cleric or the Divine. Her action sparked the Kirkwall Rebellion, which eventually escalates into a regional war between the Templar Order and the Circle mages. Meredith later reveals that she has purchased an idol made of red lyrium previously recovered by Hawke and Varric in the Deep Roads in Act I, which was taken by Varric's brother, Bartrand. The red lyrium has granted her superhuman abilities, but has also caused her insanity, as it did to Bartrand. Hawke is forced to fight Meredith as the game's final boss and kill her. =Corypheus= : Voiced by: David Sterne Corypheus is the main antagonist of the Dragon Age II DLC pack Legacy. Corypheus is one of the original Magisters Sidereal: magic-wielding magisters from the Tevinter Imperium in ancient times, who broke into the Maker's Golden City centuries ago to claim it for their own selfish, power-hungry reasons.Dragon Age: The World of Thedas Volume 2, p. 55. The Andrastrian Chantry teaches that the magisters' actions and hubris turned the city black and transformed them into the first darkspawn. Corypheus, also known as The Conductor of the Choir of Silence, is mentioned in the Chantry's Chant of Light as collaborating with the high priest of Urthemiel, known as the Architect of the Works of Beauty.Dragon Age: The World of Thedas Volume 2, p. 57. In Legacy, Corypheus is released from a prison deep within the Vimmark Mountains and seemingly killed by Hawke; unbeknownst to Hawke, his soul transferred to a nearby Grey Warden, who then take their leave. Corypheus would return as the central antagonist of Dragon Age: Inquisition. =Duke Prosper de Monfort= : Voiced by: Philippe Smolikowski Duke Prosper de Monfort is the main antagonist of the Dragon Age II DLC pack Mark of the Assassin. He is a high-ranking Orlesian nobleman, and a cousin of Empress Celene I's mother. Tallis enlists Hawke's aid to infiltrate Duke Prosper's home, the Ch√¢teau Haine, and steal the \\"Heart of the Many\\", a gem which he supposedly has no right to possess. Upon his death at the conclusion of the DLC pack, his son Cyril de Montfort inherits his holdings and titles.  Supporting characters  =Cassandra Pentaghast= : Voiced by: Miranda Raison Cassandra Pentaghast is a member of the Seekers of Truth, a secretive and powerful faction within the Andrastian Chantry answering directly to the Divine in Val Royeaux. She kidnaps Varric to extract information regarding Hawke. Varric responds by spinning a tale about Hawke's life story, framing the narrative for the events of Dragon Age II. =Leandra Amell= : Voiced by: Deborah Moore Leandra Amell is the mother of Hawke, Bethany, and Carver. She was a noblewoman from a prominent family in Kirkwall.Dragon Age: The World of Thedas Volume 2, p. 150. She is the widow of Malcolm Hawke, a mage who was originally from the Kirkwall Circle of Magi; they first met at a ball thrown in honour of the visiting Grand Duchess Florianne de Chalons by then-Viscount of Kirkwall Perrin Threnhold. She defied her family by eloping with Malcolm; the couple fled to his native Ferelden, where they settled down in Lothering and started a family together.Dragon Age: The World of Thedas Volume 2, p. 151. Shortly after the Battle of Ostagar, Leandra escapes with her family from Lothering's destruction, where they had lived for several years, fleeing with portions of the darkspawn horde in pursuit. Leandra suggests travelling to Kirkwall and seek her younger brother Gamlen's aid to enter the city. During their flight through the Blightlands, one of the twins is killed by an Ogre. Leandra and her surviving children, along with Aveline Vallen, travel to Gwaren with the aid of Flemeth, and from there they take a ship to Kirkwall. She reunites with Gamlen, who reveals that he lost the estate some years earlier. In order to get his relatives in, Gamlen commits Hawke and their sibling to work with either a mercenary company or a smuggling group for a year, during which time the Hawke family live at Gamlen's hovel in Lowtown. Upon Hawke's profitable return from the Deep Roads expedition at the conclusion of Act I, the family regains control of the old Amell estate from the slavers. When Hawke investigates the mystery of missing women in Act II, Leandra is abducted and murdered by an insane serial killer while en route to visit Gamlen, as her face resembles his deceased wife. Leandra is included in a list of notable RPG mothers compiled by RPGFan; her abduction and death is noted as one of the more emotional scenes in Dragon Age II as she had been a constant presence at Hawke's side. =Flemeth= : Voiced by: Kate Mulgrew Flemeth is the legendary \\"Witch of the Wilds\\", an ancient, transcendent and apparently immortal shape-shifting mage affecting the appearance of an eccentric old woman or a high dragon depending on the situation. Flemeth appears at the beginning of Dragon Age II to save Hawke and their party from Darkspawn while sporting a new, more menacing look. Later in the game it is revealed that regardless of what happened in Dragon Age: Origins, she survived by putting a part of her soul in a medallion that she then gave to Hawke in exchange for safe passage to Kirkwall. The Dalish elves living near Kirkwall then use the amulet to restore her. She warns Hawke and company that the world is about to change before departing. = Gamlen Amell = :Voiced by: Timothy Watson Gamlen Amell is Leandra Amell's brother and the last lord of the Amell family. After gambling away the family fortune and losing the ancestral Amell estate, Gamlen relocated to the squalor of Lowtown. He is estranged from his daughter, Charade Amell, who is a member of the notorious Friends of Red Jenny. =Marethari= : Voiced by: Kate Binchy Marethari is the Keeper of the Dalish Sabrae clan, whose members include her First (apprentice) Merrill and potentially a Warden of Dalish elf origin. As a Keeper, she is the political and spiritual leader of her clan. The Keepers are also the mages of the Dalish, though each clan will seldom have more than two fully trained mages, namely the Keeper and the Keeper's First.Dragon Age: The World of Thedas Volume 2, p. 164. In Origins, Marethari is preparing her clan to flee Ferelden, and venture north into the Free Marches, both in response to warnings from Duncan about the impending Blight and tensions with a neighboring human settlement. The clan occupies Sundermount, a mountain peak to the north of Kirkwall by the events of Dragon Age II. Hawke delivers an amulet on Flemeth's behest to Marethari, and the latter will ask Hawke to perform a ritual involving Merrill as well. The ritual involved summoning and/or reviving Flemeth, in the event that she meets her death at the hands of the Warden. After the ritual is done, Marethari asks Hawke to take Merrill back to Kirkwall but does not specify why. It is later revealed that Marethari sent Merrill away because the latter had been insistent on trying to repair the elven artifact which sickened two members of the Sabrae clan. But since the fragment she kept contained the darkspawn taint, Merrill learned blood magic from a demon imprisoned at the top of Sundermount, in order to purify it. Marethari would continue to discourage Merrill from her attempts to fix the artifact due to the potential danger. =Cullen= : Voiced by: Greg Ellis Cullen is the Knight-Captain and second-in-command to Knight-Commander Meredith by the events of Dragon Age II, after he was transferred from the Ferelden Circle and received a promotion. While he is traumatized by his experiences from Origins, he is presented as a tough but fair arbiter of his duties as a templar. He eventually encounters and becomes a recurring associate of Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall. During the final confrontation with Meredith, Cullen orders her to step down when she orders Hawke to be executed, stating that they had agreed only to arrest the Champion. Meredith will accuse him and the rest of the templars of being blood mage thralls and then attack. Cullen will fight alongside Hawke. Other members of the Templar Order who showed dissent against Meredith's leadership of the Templar Order, openly or otherwise, includes Ser Thrask, a moderate member of the Templar Order who believes that mages and templars can co-exist in harmony, and Raleigh Samson, a former templar turned beggar who is caught up in a conspiracy to oust Meredith from her position as Knight-Commander of the Kirkwall Templar Order. Depending on player choices, Samson may be reinstated as a templar and aids Hawke in the final battle against Meredith. = Bodahn and Sandal Feddic = : Voiced by: Dwight Schultz and Yuri Lowenthal Bodahn Feddic is a surface dwarf merchant, who is assisted by his adopted son, Sandal. In Dragon Age II Bodahn and Sandal journey to Kirkwall in the aftermath of the Fifth Blight, providing provisions for the Deep Roads expedition organised by House Tethras. He proudly boasts about his association with the Warden to Hawke, who had managed to become business partner to Bartrand and Varric. During the expedition, Bodahn alerts Hawke that Sandal has gone missing. Whether or not Hawke agrees to look for him, Bodahn is extremely grateful when Sandal returns to him unharmed. After the Deep Roads expedition, he sets up in the Amell Estate as servants in the Amell estate in Hightown along with Bodahn, who can craft any rune Hawke requires. Sandal also occasionally takes on cooking duties for the estate, his specialty being \\"Enchantment Soup\\". By Act 3, due to the rising tensions between templars and mages, Bodahn decided that it would be time that he and Sandal leave Kirkwall. He mentions that the Orlesian Empress is very interested in Sandal's enchantments and would like an audience with him. =Grand Cleric Elthina= : Voiced by: Rachel Atkins Elthina is the Grand Cleric of Kirkwall in the Free Marches, and is one of the city state's most powerful people. As the Grand Cleric, she tried and imprisoned Marlowe Dumar's predecessor who attempted to expel the Templar Order from Kirkwall, and indirectly undermined the political office of Viscount by allowing Kirkwall's Templar Order under Knight Commander Meredith Stannard to grow too powerful. She personally appointed Meredith to the position of the Knight-Commander of Kirkwall, and Sister Petrice to the rank of Mother in the Kirkwall Chantry. She refuses to openly take sides in the conflict between Meredith and First Enchanter Orsino of the Kirkwall Circle of Magi, claiming that she is seeking to balance the needs of everyone. By the climax of Act III, Anders blows up the Kirkwall Chantry, killing Elthina and everybody else inside. Meredith unilaterally invokes and executes the Rite of Annulment in response, sparking the Kirkwall Rebellion. =Viscount Marlowe Dumar= : Voiced by: Christopher Godwin Marlowe Dumar is the Viscount of Kirkwall, officially the most powerful political office in the city-state, though in practice Dumar holds power only at the sufferance of Kirkwall's Templar Order, despite his efforts to gain more relevance amongst Kirkwall's nobility. During his reign as viscount, the Templar Order has grown extremely powerful in Kirkwall: it has become the center of Chantry strength in eastern Thedas and holds its Circle of Magi in an iron grip. He is assisted by Seneschal Bran, who advises Dumar and is responsible for managing Kirkwall's bureaucratic establishment. During Hawke's first year in Kirkwall, Dumar put out a bounty for the safe return of his son, Saemus. He was under the impression that Saemus was kidnapped by the Qunari. When it turned out that Saemus befriended the Qunari, Dumar was concerned how scandalous it would be if it was found out that a Qunari influenced his family. Three years later, Dumar summoned Hawke to help with the matter of the Qunari. However, events culminated with the death of Saemus, who was murdered by Chantry fanatics desperate to set the whole city against the Qunari. By this point, Dumar grieves for his son and no longer has the resolve to lead his city. Dumar was later killed by the Arishok during the Qunari attack on Kirkwall and his head was tossed about his own throne room. After his death, Knight Commander Meredith tightened her stranglehold on the city, and deliberately leaves the position of Viscount vacant. Following Dumar's death, Bran becomes the de facto administrator of Kirkwall and was eventually elected Provisional Viscount, while Meredith took up stewardship of the city-state.

Life Brady was born in Islington in 1803. Her parents were both Quakers, Elizabeth and Jacob Hutchinson. In 1806 her mother Elizabeth and her two siblings had to move to Norfolk as their father was in disgrace for not settling his debts. The four of them were cared for by a Quaker meeting in Norfolk. In about 1811 her family moved back to London where she began her education at the Friends School in Islington. She did well even though the school was damp and not suited to teaching and learning. As she completed her education she became a teacher. In 1825 the school moved and began operation in Croydon. There was initially 120 places for students who began at the age of nine. Children did not have to be members of the Quakers but these children were accepted first. In 1826 Edward Foster Brady who had been born in London in 1802 and who had also been a pupil of the school when it was in Islington began work there as another teacher. Before her arrived he had been abroad getting suffering from tuberculosis. In 1828 the school had a marriage when Elizabeth married Edward Brady. In 1833 they became joint superintendents of the Friends' School, although Edward was an invalid by 1835. He died in 1838 and Elizabeth Brady lead the school until 1842 when she moved to York. In York, she led The Mount School, a Quaker school for girls at 1 Castlegate until 1847. The school had been founded by Quakers including Joseph Rowntree and Samuel Tuke. She was replaced by Eliza Stringer when she left due to ill health and moved to Birmingham. Two years later she started her own girls school for Quakers in Edgbaston. She retired again 1869 after leading the school for 21 years. She was lifelong Quaker supporting causes including abolition, the Dorcas society and the Peace Society. Her retirement was not care-free as she soon became an invalid. Brady died in 1874 in Edgbaston leaving about ¬£4000. She had given birth to three children from 1829 to 1834 during her short marriage. These were Bedford Foster, Elizabeth and Anna Jane.

Meroitic prince smiting his enemies (early first century AD) Kerma Mirror. Kerma Period, 1700-1550 BC. The Kerma culture was the first Nubian kingdom to unify much of the region. The Classic Kerma Culture, named for its royal capital at Kerma, was one of the earliest urban centers in the Nile region Kerma culture was militaristic. This is attested by the many bronze daggers or swords as well as archer burials found in their graves. Despite assimilation, the Nubian elite remained rebellious during Ancient Egyptian occupation. Numerous rebellions and military conflict occurred almost under every Ancient Egyptian reign until the 20th dynasty. At one point, Kerma came very close to conquering Egypt as the Egyptians suffered a serious defeat by the natives of Kerma.Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret The Times (London, 2003) Ta-Seti which means; \\"land of the bow\\" was the name used to refer to Nubia itself by the ancient Egyptians for their skills in archery.Ancient Nubia: A-Group 3800‚Äì3100 BCThe Fitzwilliam Museum: Kemet Nubian tribes such as the Medjay served as mercenaries in Ancient Egypt.They also were sometimes employed as soldiers (as we know from the stele of Res and Ptahwer). During the Second Intermediate Period, they were even used in Kamose's campaign against the Hyksos and became instrumental in making the Egyptian state into a military power.

Kerma Museum. The Kingdom of Kush began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the Dongola Reach was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper Dongola Reach. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of Amun at the rebuilt Kawa temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta stele at Elephantine, places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic period', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Mero√´ around 300 BC. =Wars of Kush= War against Assyria Relief from the Temple of Amun, Jebel Barkal, showing a battle between Kushites and Assyrians Kushite Kings conquered Egypt and formed the 25th dynasty, reigning in part or all of Ancient Egypt from 744 to 656 BC. Taharqa began cultivating alliances with elements in Phoenicia and Philistia who were prepared to take a more independent position against Assyria. Taharqa's army undertook successful military campaigns, as attested by the \\"list of conquered Asiatic principalities\\" from the Mut temple at Karnak and \\"conquered peoples and countries (Libyans, Shasu nomads, Phoenicians?, Khor in Palestine)\\" from Sanam temple inscriptions. Torok mentions the military success was due to Taharqa's efforts to strengthen the army through daily training in long-distance running, as well as Assyria's preoccupation with Babylon and Elam. Taharqa also built military settlements at the Semna and Buhen forts and the fortified site of Qasr Ibrim. Imperial ambitions of the Assyrian Empire as well as the growing influence of the 25th dynasty made war with the inevitable. In 701 BC, Taharqa and his army aided Judah and King Hezekiah in withstanding a siege by King Sennacherib of Assyria (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9). There are various theories (Taharqa's army, disease, divine intervention, Hezekiah's surrender, Herodotus' mice theory) that try to explain as to why the Assyrians failed to take Jerusalem but withdrew to Assyria. Many historians claim that Sennacherib was the overlord of Khor following the siege in 701 BC. Sennacherib's annals record Judah was forced into tribute after the siege. However, this is contradicted by Khor's frequent utilization of an Egyptian system of weights for trade, the 20 year cessation in Assyria's pattern (before 701 and after Sennacherib's death) of repeatedly invading Khor, Khor paying tribute to Amun of Karnak in the first half of Taharqa's reign, and Taharqa flouting Assyria's ban on Lebanese cedar exports to Egypt, while Taharqa was building his temple to amun at Kawa. Statue of Pharaoh Taharqa in the National Museum of Sudan In 679 BC, Sennacherib's successor, King Esarhaddon, campaigned into Khor and took a town loyal to Egypt. After destroying Sidon and forcing Tyre into tribute in 677-676 BC, Esarhaddon carried a fullscale invasion of Egypt in 674 BC. Taharqa and his army defeated the Assyrians outright in 674 BC, according to Babylonian records. There are few Assyrian sources on the invasion. However, it ended in what some scholars have assumed was possibly one of Assyria's worst defeats.' In 672 BC, Taharqa brought reserve troops from Kush, as mentioned in rock inscriptions. Taharqa's Egypt still held sway in Khor during this period as evidenced by Esarhaddon's 671 BC annal mentioning that Tyre's King Ba'lu had \\"put his trust upon his friend Taharqa\\", Ashkelon's alliance with Egypt, and Esarhaddon's inscription asking \\"if the Kushite-Egyptian forces 'plan and strive to wage war in any way' and if the Egyptian forces will defeat Esarhaddon at Ashkelon.\\" However, Taharqa was defeated in Egypt in 671 BC when Esarhaddon conquered Northern Egypt. He went on to capture Memphis, as well as impose tribute, before withrawing back to Assyria. Although the Pharaoh Taharqa had escaped to the south, Esarhaddon captured the Pharaoh's family, including \\"Prince Nes-Anhuret\\" and the royal wives,\\" which were sent to Assyria as hostages. Cuneiform tablets mention numerous horses and gold headdresses were taken back to Assyria. In 669 BC, Taharqa reoccupied Memphis, as well as the Delta, and recommenced intrigues with the king of Tyre. Taharqa intrigued in the affairs of Lower Egypt, and fanned numerous revolts. Esarhaddon again led his army to Egypt and on his death in 668 BC, the command passed to Ashurbanipal. Ashurbanipal and the Assyrians again defeated Taharqa, advancing as far south as Thebes. However, direct Assyrian control was not established. The rebellion was stopped and Ashurbanipal appointed as his vassal ruler in Egypt Necho I, who had been king of the city Sais. Necho's son, Psamtik I was educated at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh during Esarhaddon's reign.' As late as 665 BC, the vassal rulers of Sais, Mendes, and Pelusium were still making overtures to Taharqa in Kush. The vassal's plot was uncovered by Ashurbanipal and all rebels but Necho of Sais were executed. War against Roman legions Meroitic forces fought numerous battles against Rome, some successful. A peace treaty was eventually negotiuated between Augustus and Kushite diplomats, with Rome ceding a buffer strip along the southern border and exempting the Kushites from paying any tribute. The Roman conquest of Egypt put it on a collision course with the Sudanic powers of the southern regions. In 25 BC, Kushites under their ruler Teriteqas, invaded Egypt with some 30,000 troops. Kushite forces were mostly infantry and their armament consisted of bows about 4 cubits long, shields of rawhide, clubs, hatchets, pikes and swords.Selina O'Grady, 2012, And Man Created God: A History of the World at the time of Jesus, pp. 79-88. See also Strabo, Geographia, Book XVII, Chaps 1 -3. Translated from Greek by W. Falconer (1903) The Mero√´ Head of Augustus, bronze Roman portraiture bust from Mero√´, Kingdom of Kush (Nubia, modern Sudan), 27‚Äì25 BC The Kushites penetrated as far south as the Aswan area, defeating three Roman cohorts, conquering Syene, Elephantine and Philae, capturing thousands of Egyptians, and overthrowing bronze statutes of Augustus recently erected there. The head of one of these Augustian statutes was carried off to Meroe as a trophy, and buried under a temple threshold of the Candace Amanirenas, to commemorate the Kushite victory, and symbolically tread on her enemies.O' Grady 79-88 A year later, Rome dispatched troops under Gaius Petronius to confront the Kushites, with the Romans repulsing a poorly armed Meroitic force at Pselchis.Strabo, Geographica Strabo reports that Petronius continued to advance- taking Premnis and then the Kushite city of Napata.Derek A. Welsby. 1998. The Kingdom of Kush: The Napatan and Meroitic Empires. Petronius deemed the roadless country beyond unsuitable or too difficult for further operations. He pulled back to Premnis, strengthening its fortifications, and leaving a garrison in place.Strabo, Geographia, Book XVII, Chaps 1 -3 These setbacks did not settle hostilities however, for a Kushite resurgence occurred just three years later under the queen or Candace Amanirenas, with strong reinforcements of African troops from further south. Kushite pressure now once more advanced on Premnis. The Romans countered this initiative by sending more troops to reinforce the city.Robert B. Jackson. 2002. At Empire's Edge: Exploring Rome's Egyptian Frontier. p. 140-156 A decisive final campaign did not take place however but negotiations instead- with final outcomes that saw major concessions being granted to an enemy of Rome.Fluehr-Lobban, RHodes et al. (2004) Race and identity in the Nile Valley: ancient and modern perspectives. p 55 The Meroitic diplomats were invited to confer with the Roman emperor Augustus himself on the Greek island of Samos where he was headquartered temporarily. That the Kushites did not appear as beaten supplicants is suggested by the aggressive message brought to the Romans by the envoys of Meroe. A bundle of golden arrows was presented with the envoys reputedly saying: \\"The Candace sends you these arrows. If you want peace, they are a token of her friendship and warmth. If you want war, you are going to need them.\\"O'Grady 79-88 An entente between the two parties was beneficial to both. The Kushites were a regional power in their own right and resented paying tribute. The Romans sought a quiet southern border for their absolutely essential Egyptian grain supplies, without constant war commitments, and welcomed a friendly buffer state in a border region beset with raiding nomads. The Kushites too appear to have found nomads like the Blemmyes to be a problem, allowed Rome monitoring and staging outposts against them, and even conducted joint military operations with the Romans in later years against such mauraders.Richard Lobban 2004. Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia, 2004. p70-78 The conditions were ripe for a deal. During negotiations, Augustus granted the Kushite envoys all they asked for, and also cancelled the tribute earlier demanded by Rome.Jackson, Empire's Edge, p 149 Premmis (Qasr Ibrim), and areas north of Qasr Ibrim in the southern portion of the \\"Thirty-Mile Strip\\"] were ceded to the Kushites, the Dodekaschoinos was established as a buffer zone, and Roman forces were pulled back to the old Greek Ptolemaic border at Maharraqa.Jackson, At Empire's Edge p. 149 Roman emperor Augustus signed the treaty with the Kushites on Samos. The settlement bought Rome peace and quiet on its Egyptian frontier, and increased the prestige of Roman Emperor Augustus, demonstrating his skill and ability to broker peace without constant warfare, and do business with the distant Kushites, who a short time earlier had been fighting his troops. The respect accorded the emperor by the Kushite envoys as the treaty was signed also created a favorable impression with other foreign ambassadors present on Samos, including envoys from India, and strengthened Augustus' hand in upcoming negotiations with the powerful Parthians.Raoul McLaughlin, 2014. The ROman Empire and the Indian Ocean. p61-72 The settlement ushered in a period of peace between the two empires for around three centuries. Inscriptions erected by Queen Amanirenas on an ancient temple at Hamadab, south of Meroe, record the war and the favorable outcome from the Kushite perspective.McLaughlin, The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean 61-72 Along with his signature on the official treaty, Roman emperor Augustus marked the agreement by directing his administrators to collaborate with regional priests in the erection of a temple at Dendur, and inscriptions depict the emperor himself celebrating local deities.Robert Bianchi, 2004.

According to Ayalon: :The absolutely unambiguous evidence and unanimous agreement of the early Muslim sources is that the Arabs abrupt stop was caused solely and exclusively by the superb military resistance of the Christian Nubians. .. the Nubian Dam. The array of those early sources includes the two most important chronicles of early Islam, al-Tabari (d. 926) and al-Yaqubi (d. 905); the two best extant books on the Muslim conquests, al-Baladhuri (d. 892) and Ibn al-A tham al-Kufi (d. 926); the most central encyclopedic work of al-Masudi (d.956); and the two best early sources dedicated specifically to Egypt, Ibn Abd al-Hakim (d. 871) and al-Kindi (961).. All of the above-cited sources attribute Nubian success to their superb archery.. To this central factor should be added the combination of the Nubians' military prowess and Christian zeal; their acquaintance of the terrain; the narrowness of the front line that they had to defend; and, quite possibly, the series of cataracts situated at their back, and other natural obstacles.. The Nubians fought the Muslims very fiercely. When they encountered them they showered them with arrows, until all of them were wounded and they withdrew with many wounds and gouged eyes. Therefore they were called \\"the marksmen of the eye.\\" Yet another notes: :The awe and respect that the Muslims had for their Nubian adversaries are reflected in the fact that even a rather late Umayyad caliph, Umar b Abd al- Aziz (Umar II 717-720), is said to have ratified the Nubian-Muslim treaty out of fear for the safety of the Muslims (he ratified the peace treaty out of consideration for the Muslims and out of [a desire] to spare their lives..\\"Views from Arab scholars and Merchants\\" Jay Spaulding and Nehemia Levtzion, IN Medieval West Africa: Views From Arab Scholars and Merchants, 2003. The Nubians constituted an \\"African front\\" that barred Islam's spread, along with others in Central Asia, India and the Anatolian/Mediterranean zone. Whereas the Islamic military expansion began with swift conquests across Byzantium, Central Asia, the Maghreb and Spain, such quick triumphs foundered at the Sudanic barrier.Ayalon, The Nubian Dam.. Internal divisions, along with infiltration by nomads were to weaken the \\"Nubian dam\\" however, and eventually it gave way to Muslim expansion from Egypt and elsewhere in the region. Weapons and organization =Projectiles= 11th Dynasty model of Nubian archers in the Egyptian army, from a tomb in Asyut (c. 2130‚Äì1991 BC). Bowmen were the most important force components in Kushite military.Jim Hamm. 2000. The Traditional Bowyer's Bible, Volume 3, pp. 138-152 Ancient sources indicate that Kushite archers favored one-piece bows that were between six and seven feet long, with so powerful a draw strength that many of the archers user their feet to bend their bows. However, composite bows were also used in their arsenal. Greek historian, Herodotus indicated that primary bow construction was of seasoned palm wood, with arrows made of cane. Kushite arrows were often poisoned-tipped.David Nicolle, Angus McBride. 1991. Rome's Enemies 5: The Desert Frontier. p. 11-15 Kushite archers were noted for their archery prowess by the Ancient Egyptians. Cambyses ventured into Kush after conquering Egypt but logistical difficulties in crossing desert terrain were compounded by the fierce response of the Kushite armies, particularly accurate volleys of archery that not only decimated Persian ranks, but sometimes targeted the faces and eyes of individual Persian warriors. One historical source notes: :\\"So from the battlements as though on the walls of a citadel, the archers kept up with a continual discharge of well aimed shafts, so dense that the Persians had the sensation of a cloud descending upon them, especially when the Kushites made their enemies; eyes the targets.. SO unerring was their aim that those who they pierced with their shafts rushed about wildly in the throngs with the arrows projecting from their eyes like double flutes.\\" At Qasr Ibrim, two crossbow darts have been discovered. The use of crossbows had hitherto been unattested in Nubia. One simple wooden self bow is known from an early Nobadian burial in Qustul. The Nobadians shot barbed and possibly poisoned arrows of around 50 cm length. To store the arrows, they used quivers made of tanned leather originally from long-necked animals like goats or gazelles. Additionally, they were enhanced with straps, flaps and elaborate decoration. The quivers were possibly worn not in the back, but in the front. On the hand holding the bow, the archers wore bracelets to protect the hand from injuries while drawing the bowstring. For the nobility, the bracelets could be made of silver, while poorer versions were made of rawhide. Furthermore, the archers wore thumb rings, measuring between three and four cm. Thus, Nubian archers would have employed a drawing technique very similar to the Persian and Chinese one, both of which were also reliant on thumb rings. Mounted archery was prevalent in both Meroitic and post-Meroitic period. =Siege weapons= During the siege of Hermopolis in the 8th century BC, siege towers were built for the Kushite army led by Piye, in order to enhance the efficiency of Kushite archers. After leaving Thebes, Piye's first objective was besieging Ashmunein. He gathered his army after their lack of success so far, and undertook the personal supervision of operations including the erection of a siege tower from which Kushite archers could fire down into the city. Early shelters protecting sappers armed with poles trying to breach mud-brick ramparts gave way to Battering rams. The use of the battering ram by Kushite forces against Egyptian cities are recorded on the stele of Piye; =Melee weapons= Meroitic infantry attacking Rome consisted of shields of rawhide, clubs, hatchets, pikes and swords. Graffito from the Temple of Kalabsha (Talmis), depicting king Silko on horse back spearing an enemy while being crowned by Nike. A weapon characteristic for the Nobadians was a type of short sword. It has a straight hollow-ground blade which was sharpened only on one edge and was therefore not designed to thrust, but to hack. Apart of said swords, there were also lances, some of them with large blades, as well as halberds. The large-bladed lances and the halberds could have possibly been only ceremonial. =Other war equipments= The forces of Kerma wore no armor. However,Chariots as well as armory were manufactured in Kush during the Meroitic period.Robert Morkot. Historical dictionary of ancient Egyptian warfare. Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, p. 26, xlvi Nobadian warriors and their leadership made use of shields and body armour, mostly manufactured from leather. Fragments of thick hide have been found in the royal tombs of Qustul, suggesting that the principal interment was usually buried while wearing armour. A well-preserved and richly decorated breastplate made of oxhide comes from Qasr Ibrim, while a comparable, but more fragmentary piece was discovered at Gebel Adda. However, this breastplate was made of reptile hide, possibly from a crocodile. Another fragment which possibly once constituted a body armour comes from Qustul. It consists of several layers of tanned leather and was studded with lead rosettes. Elephants were occasionally used in warfare during the Meroitic period as seen in the war against Rome around 20 BC. There is some debate about the purpose of the Great Enclosure at Musawwarat es- Sufra, with earlier suggestions including an elephant-training camp.UNESCO Nomination document p.43. Taharqa built military settlements at the Semna and Buhen forts as well as the fortified site of Qasr Ibrim. There is archaeological evidence for the Kushite fortification of Kalabsha, under the reign of Yesebokheamani resumably as a defence against the raiding Blemmyes.

Abd al-Malik's governorship was a turbulent one, as it coincided with the arrival of the Abbasid Revolution in Egypt.

It is found in India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where it is a pest of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan). Distribution Clavigralla gibbosa occurs in India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where the adults and nymphs feed on pigeon pea. Life cycle As a hemipteran, this species is hemimetabolous, meaning that it does not undergo metamorphosis. Instead, the young are called nymphs. They moult several times, and each instar resembles the adult more than the previous one. Eggs are laid in clutches of five to ten on leaves and pods of the host plant, three or four hundred eggs being laid by each female over a period of five months. The eggs hatch in four to twenty days, nymphal development taking 4.3 days in May and 20 days in January. Generations show considerable overlap and up to six generations can occur between November and May. Although adult insects can live on other leguminous plants, nymphal development only takes place on pigeon pea. Ecology Pigeon pea is an important leguminous crop in semi-arid areas of tropical and subtropical India, ranking second behind chickpeas. The plant is a perennial, has a long tap root and can thrive in drier conditions than maize and millet. The seeds of pigeon pea contain high levels of protein and the amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan; they are eaten fresh or dried, the hulm is fed to livestock and the woody parts of the plant are used for firewood. The plant is attacked by a number of insect pests, including the gram pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera), the arhar plume moth (Exelastis atomosa), arhar pod fly (Melanagromyza obtusa), the legume pod borer (Maruca vitrata), the tur pod bug and the blister beetle (Mylabris spp.). The tur pod bug is the most damaging sap-sucking pest of pigeon pea in India. The pods and seeds are the prime site for attack, young seeds being damaged; during heavy attacks the pods become shrivelled. Flowers, leaves and young shoots are additionally attacked.

Rabani serves as the director of The Sackler Center for Computational Molecular and Materials Science, and as a faculty scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Education  Rabani received his B.Sc. in chemistry from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1991. Under the supervision of Raphael David Levine, Rabani studied molecular Rydberg states, completing his PhD. in 1996. Having completed his post-doctoral fellowship at Columbia University in 1999 he joined the faculty of the School of Chemistry at the Tel Aviv University.  Career  Rabani's interest in the theory of nanomaterials rose during his post-doctoral stay in the group of Bruce J. Berne at Columbia University, studying the electronic properties of cadmium selenide nanocrystals. This work included the first application of the filter- diagonalization method for the study of electronic structure, as well as the first quantitative study interactions between nanocrystals. Later early work in Rabani's independent career included further the study of the latter, the highlight of which is the theoretical study of drying-induced self-assembly of nanocrystals. Starting in 2012, Rabani has been working extensively with Roi Baer (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Daniel Neuhauser (University of California, Los Angeles) on applying stochastic methods for the study of the electronic structure of large systems, such as nanocrystals, including stochastic formulations of the random-phase approximation, second order M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory and density functional theory. Such methods have allowed the calculation of GW self-energies of 10,000 electrons-large systems with linear scaling. Rabani became a full professor at Tel Aviv University in 2008.

Her research considers membrane biophysics and bioelectronic devices. During the COVID-19 pandemic Daniel used bioelectronic devices to develop coronavirus disease drugs.  Early life and education  Daniel was born in suburban Philadelphia. Her father was an immigrant from Germany, who relocated to Pennsylvania on leaving Europe. Daniel was the first member of her family to attend college. During high school she became inspired by chemistry. She was an undergraduate student in chemical engineering at Lehigh University. She wondered whether she might be interested in research, and visited the office of Manoj Chaudhury. He asked her to study the movement of liquid droplets on various surfaces with different surface tension. Remarkably, her first journey into research ended up published in Science, before she had even earned her master's degree. She remained at Lehigh University for her doctoral research, continuing to study the motion of liquid droplets on surfaces with different wettabilities. As part of her droplet research, she developed technologies to manipulate fluids in miniature devices. The devices she developed allowed the precise mixing of droplets as well as thermosensitive reactions. Her research attracted considerable attention, and she stared working with Pierre-Gilles de Gennes on how to create ratchet motion with the droplets.  Research and career  After completing her doctorate Daniel joined the laboratory of Paul Cremer at Texas A&M; University. Here she shifted focus, concentrating on biological interfaces and the development of cell membranes. Specifically, Daniel worked on solid-supported lipid bilayers. She showed that an artificial glycocalyx- like nanostructure could serve as a size-selective filter for protein binding. This achievement inspired Daniel to use the solid-supported lipid bilayers to separate membrane-bound species via electrophoresis. In 2007 Daniel joined Cornell University in the Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, where she leads two distinct research programmes, one focussed on biological function and the other on surface science. She is interested in the role of membrane lipids in biological interactions, with a focus on how viruses interact with cell membranes. Her motivation to study virus ‚Äì membrane interactions lies in the potential to hijack the virus and use it to perform specific tasks. She has identified the speed at which viral genomes are transferred out of viruses and into the cell membranes. Cell membranes contain a variety of proteins and biomolecules, which are held within a matrix of lipid phases. Daniel believes that the interactions of these lipid phases control the regulation of the function of the cell membrane. Alongside her biology-focussed work, Daniel investigates the motion and coalescence of droplets. Daniel pioneered the development of biomembrane platforms that permit the recreation of cellular processes on a chip. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Daniel worked with R√≥is√≠n Owens, a biochemist she met whilst a visiting scholar at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des mines de Saint-√âtienne, on devices that allowed the rapid testing of potential coronavirus drugs. Daniel used membrane fusion to identify a specific targets for anti-viral drugs. To continue her studies of coronaviruses, she was awarded seed-funding from the Office of the Vice Provost for Research (OVPR).  Academic service  Daniel is involved with various initiatives to promote women in science. On arriving at Cornell University she became interested in the women's engineering group, and is a member of Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) at Cornell. She was appointed Director of Graduate Studies at Cornell University in 2016, and under her leadership she recruited the most diverse class in the history of the school of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.

Burke (April 10, 1899 - October 22, 1982) was a public official in Rutland, Vermont. He served as Rutland's assistant city treasurer from 1917 to 1935 and U.S. Marshal for Vermont from 1935 until 1954. Biography Edward L. Burke was born in Rutland, Vermont on April 10, 1899, a son of Edward and Margaret (Carroll) Burke. He was educated in the parochial schools of Rutland and attended St. Peter's Commercial School, a post-high school business training institute operated by Rutland's Sisters of St. Joseph convent. After completing his education, Burke was employed at the Combination Store, a downtown Rutland variety retailer. He later worked for the Rutland Railroad. In 1917, Burke was appointed Rutland's assistant city treasurer, and he served in this position until 1935. Active in politics as a Democrat, in 1934 he was the party's unsuccessful nominee for Vermont State Treasurer. In 1935, Burke was appointed U.S. Marshal for Vermont, succeeding Albert W. Harvey. Harvey, a Republican, served during the administrations of Republicans Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. The expiration of Harvey's term enabled Roosevelt, a Democrat who took office in 1933, to name a Democrat to the marshal's position. Burke served as Marshal during the rest of Roosevelt's term and during the term of Roosevelt's Democratic successor, Harry S. Truman. He retired in February 1954, enabling Truman's Republican successor Dwight D. Eisenhower to name a Republican as Vermont's U.S. Marshal, and Burke was succeeded by Dewey H. Perry. In addition to his government service, Burke was involved in civic and fraternal organizations. This list included Rutland's Christ the King church, the Knights of Columbus, Fraternal Order of Eagles, Rutland Community Chest, and the March of Dimes. Burke died in Rutland on October 22, 1982. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Rutland. Family On April 18, 1922, Burke married Ellen E. Cooley (1900-1985) of Rutland. They were the parents of two daughters, Mary and Patricia.

When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the Ro-100s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at .Chesneau, p. 204 The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of eight torpedoes. They were also armed with two single mounts for Type 96 anti-aircraft guns or a single L/40 AA gun.Bagnasco, p. 193 Construction and commissioning Ro-100 was laid down as Submarine No. 210 on 30 June 1941 by the Kure Naval Arsenal at Kure, Japan. She had been renamed Ro-100 by the time she was launched on 6 December 1941. She was completed and commissioned on 23 September 1942. Service history =September 1942‚ÄìFebruary 1943= Upon commissioning, Ro-100 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District and assigned to the Kure Submarine Squadron for workups. She was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 8th Fleet on 15 December 1942. On 20 December 1942, she departed Yokosuka bound for Truk, which she reached on 28 December 1942. Ro-100 departed Truk bound for Rabaul on New Britain on 6 January 1943, but suffered a diesel engine breakdown that forced to return to Truk on 7 January 1943 for repairs. With her engine repaired, she again set out for Rabaul on 3 February 1943. While she was in the Bismarck Sea northwest of Rabaul on 6 February 1943, an Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service Aichi E13A1 (Allied reporting name \\"Jake\\") floatplane mistakenly bombed her, but she suffered only minor damage. She arrived at Rabaul on 7 February 1943. =First war patrol= On 8 February 1943, Ro-100 departed Rabaul to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Coral Sea south of Port Moresby, New Guinea. She was south- southwest of Port Moresby on 14 February 1943 when she sighted an Allied convoy after 16:30 and began a submerged approach at to reach an attack position. During the approach, her commanding officer neglected to conduct a periscope sweep to watch for other Allied ships, and he did not notice an approaching Allied destroyer until it was almost on top of Ro-100. Ro-100 crash-dived to , and the destroyer dropped more than a dozen depth charges. The exploding depth charges caused several leaks in Ro-100‚Ä≤s main engine room and conning tower, knocked out both of her periscopes, and caused her to take on a steep up-angle. To assist in getting Ro-100 back on an even keel so that her crew could regain control of her before she sank to collapse depth, her commanding officer ordered every available crewman to the forward torpedo room to weigh down her bow. Ro-100 survived, but was forced to abandon her patrol and return to Rabaul for repairs. After she arrived at Rabaul on 20 February 1943, several of her officers were replaced. =Operation I-Go= After the Combined Fleet initiated Operation I-Go ‚Äî a reinforcement of the 11th Air Fleet base at Rabaul by planes from the aircraft carriers and and of the Japanese naval air base on Balalae Island in the Shortland Islands by planes from the aircraft carriers and . ‚Äî Ro-100 departed Rabaul on 1 April 1943 to support the operation by patrolling southeast of Guadalcanal, but soon after she arrived in her patrol area her gyrocompass broke, forcing her to abort her patrol. She returned to Rabaul on 12 April 1943. =Second and third war patrols= Ro-100 got underway from Rabaul on 22 April 1943 for her second war patrol, again bound for a patrol area southeast of Guadalcanal. The patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Rabaul on 14 May 1943. She put to sea on 27 May for her third war patrol, again southeast of Guadalcanal, but it also passed quietly, and she returned to Rabaul on 20 June 1943. =Fourth war patrol= On 30 June 1943, the New Georgia campaign began with the U.S. landings on New Georgia, Rendova, and other islands in the central Solomon Islands. Ro-100 departed Rabaul on 2 July 1943 for her fourth war patrol, assigned a patrol area south of Rendova. While in the Blanche Channel during darkness in early July 1943 conducting a reconnaissance of the American airfield on New Georgia, Ro-100 struck a reef, suffering damage to a fuel tank and two of her bow torpedo tubes. After reporting her damage, she received orders to pick up stranded Imperial Japanese Navy pilots of the 201st and 204th Naval Air Group at Simbo in the western Solomon Islands and then proceed to Rabaul for repairs. After picking up the pilots, she disembarked them at Buin on Bougainville, then arrived at Rabaul on 12 July 1943. =August 1943= On 7 August 1943, Ro-100 left Rabaul bound for the waters off New Guinea. Her crew soon noticed a leak from her recently repaired fuel tank, and she turned back. She was on the surface off Buka Island on 8 August 1943 when an unidentified submarine attacked her; she sighted the wakes of four torpedoes, but all of them missed. While she was on the surface off Cape St. George on New Ireland that night, an Allied patrol plane surprised her, dropping flares, missing her with two bombs, and strafing her. She crash- dived, escaped, and arrived at Rabaul on 11 August 1943. =Fifth and sixth war patrols= Ro-100 got underway from Rabaul in mid-August 1943 for her fifth war patrol. While at sea, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 51 on 20 August 1943, but otherwuse the patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Rabaul in early September 1943. She put to sea on 7 September 1943 for her sixth war patrol, assigned a patrol area north of New Guinea. It also passed quietly, and she returned to Rabaul on 18 September 1943. She later proceeded to Truk, where she was drydocked on 30 September 1943. =Seventh war patrol= On 1 November 1943, the Bougainville campaign began with the U..S. landings at Cape Torokina on Bougainville. Tasked to run supplies to Japanese forces fighting on Bougainville and then patrol off Bougainville, Ro-100 departed Truk on 10 November and reached Rabaul on 19 November 1943. After loading a cargo of rubber containers packed with food, she departed Rabaul at 05:00 on 23 November 1943 on an emergency supply run to Buin on Bougainville. =Loss= On 25 November 1943, Ro-100 was on the surface in Bougainville Strait, making her way to Bougainville via the northern channel to Buin, when she struck a mine at 19:10 local time west of Oema Island at . The explosion blew her commanding officer and lookouts overboard, and she began to sink rapidly. Her engineering officer ordered all hands still on board to abandon ship. Sharks attacked her survivors as they tried to swim to Buin, and ultimately only 12 men out of her crew of 50 survived. The Japanese struck Ro-100 from the Navy list on 5 February 1944.

Early life  Constance Janet Weldon was born in Winter Haven, Florida, on January 25, 1932. Her father, George, was a groundskeeper and soon after Weldon was born the family moved to Miami, where he worked on the Vizcaya estate. Her mother Edythe Roebke was a teacher. Weldon started playing instruments at school, and by the time she was due to graduate from Miami Jackson High School, she had decided to study at the University of Miami and specialise in tuba performance. She reportedly \\"fell in love with the tuba\\" after her father brought one home from a pawn shop.  Career  Weldon's performance career began in 1951 after auditioning for the Tanglewood Music Festival. She spent the summer performing there and as a result was offered a position with the Rio de Janeiro Symphony Orchestra, but declined in order to finish her degree. She graduated with a BA in 1953 and continued to study for an MA in education. Weldon performed again at the Tanglewood Music Festival in 1954, then in 1955 joined Arthur Fiedler‚Äôs Boston Pops Orchestra, who she performed with for two seasons. This meant she was the first female tuba player in a major American orchestra. She moved from Boston to perform with the North Carolina Symphony from 1956 to 1957. From North Carolina she moved to Amsterdam, funded by a Fulbright Scholarship, in order to study with Adrian Boorsma. Whilst there she became Acting Principal for the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. She also worked for the Netherlands Ballet Orchestra. On her return to America, Weldon joined the Kansas City Philharmonic. In 1960 Weldon joined the University of Miami, as a full-time professor of tuba. During her time there she was the founder and director of the University of Miami Tuba Ensemble. The foundation of tuba chamber music ensembles by Weldon was pioneering. She taught at the university until her retirement in 1991. In 1971 she was appointed Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Studies at the Frost School of Music. She also sponsored, with the University of Miami School of Music and the Tuba Society of Miami, the International Tuba Ensemble Competition Contest. Many of her students became notable tuba players, including: Mike Roylance, principal tuba at the Boston Symphony Orchestra; James Jenkins, principal with the Jacksonville Symphony; Sam Pilafian, founder of Empire Brass.

Biography He was born in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, the son of Martha and James Nash, who was a cloth worker. He studied music in his youth, and learned cornet. In 1854 he married Lydney-born Margaret Brown in Gloucester, and a few years later he was co-owner of the small Oaken and Churchway Level Colliery near Parkend in the Forest of Dean. \\"Oaken Level\\", Forest of Dean Coal Mining.

He lived with his wife and children at York Lodge near Parkend, where he was described in the 1861 census as a coal master, fire brick maker, and coal and coke merchant.Census Returns of England and Wales, 1861, West Dean Parish, Gloucestershire His business failed and in 1864 he was described as bankrupt. By that time, he was already familiar with London music halls, and had met impresario Charles Morton, the \\"Father of the Halls\\" and proprietor of the Canterbury and Oxford Music Halls. Morton presented him on stage and, though Nash was initially afflicted by stage fright, he rapidly became successful. His ebullient personality soon gained him the nickname \\"Jolly\\", and he was also billed as \\"The Laughing Blacksmith\\". He specialised in comic songs such as \\"The Nice Old Maids\\", \\"Sister Mary Walked Like That\\", \\"I Couldn't Help Laughing\\", \\"The Convivial Man\\", and his version of \\"Little Brown Jug\\". Music historian Peter Gammond said of Nash: \\"A large man who shook with mirth as he sang, he pioneered the laughing song which was copied by many later exponents; he was also an early practitioner of the funny walk\\".Peter Gammond, The Oxford Companion to Popular Music, Oxford University Press, 1991, p.279 He moved to London with his family, and became Chairman of the Strand Music Hall between 1866 and 1868.

In 1874, Nash undertook his first tour of the United States, and was one of the first British music hall performers to do so. According to the New York Herald, within a few minutes of his first appearance he \\"convinced his audience that it was no vulgar music-hall performance, but a genuine, genial and artistic humourist..... His humour is so infectious that no sooner does he enter into one of his inimitable laughing songs, than the whole audience at once gives way, and a chorus of laughter is raised..\\".Mary Atkins, \\"'Jolly' John Nash: A Forest 'Lion Comique'\\", The New Regard: Journal of the Forest of Dean Local History Society, No.23, 2009, pp.60-64 He toured the U.S. again in 1876, and returned in 1886 for an eighteen-month tour with his own company. He later said that \\"he had sung in every State, shaken hands with three Presidents, and lunched with two.\\" In 1889, he toured in Australia, where he was described as \\"a world-renowned vocalist... a capital raconteur and an admirable executant on many musical instruments...\\". He regularly performed on concertina, as well as cornet. In 1891 he published a book of stories and anecdotes, The Merriest Man Alive. He returned to perform in the Forest of Dean in 1893. He appeared in numerous shows to benefit his fellow performers, and became president of the Music Hall Sick Fund Provident Society. Fundraising events were also held for his own benefit, featuring such performers as George Robey, Herbert Campbell, Harry Randall, Dan Leno, Florrie Forde, and G. H. Chirgwin.

Ethel Merker (1923‚Äì2012)International Women's Brass Conference, Historic Ladies of Horn. was a prominent freelance and orchestral horn player in Chicago, who collaborated with the Frank Holton Company on the design and development of the Merker-Matic line of horns.  Early life and education  Kathryn Ethel Merker, known as Ethel, grew up in Chicago Heights, Illinois. She studied piano when she was young. In the third grade, Merker began playing horn. She studied horn with Max Pottag throughout high school, and later with Philip Farkas and Arnold Jacobs, all members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Merker earned two degrees from Northwestern University: a bachelor of music education in 1946 and a master of music in 1947.  Career  Merker performed as an orchestral horn player as well as in jazz, pop, and commercial settings. Beginning at age eighteen, she played principal horn in the Chicago NBC Radio Orchestra from 1941 to 1950, where she was the only woman. She held this position while attending Northwestern University. Merker later played with the Chicago Symphony, where she played alongside her teacher Philip Farkas. She also played with the Chicago Pops, Chicago Lyric Opera, Milwaukee Symphony, Berlin Radio Orchestra, New York City Ballet, New York City Opera, and the Boston Pops orchestras. Merker performed with popular artists including Barbra Streisand, Ramsey Lewis, Quincy Jones, the Jackson Five, and John Denver. She recorded on popular albums including those released by the Rolling Stones, Smothers Brothers, and Diana Ross and The Supremes. Vocalist Peggy Lee insisted on including Ethel in her backing orchestra, which Lee termed her \\"20-man-and-Ethel-band.\\" Singer-songwriter Johnny Mathis called Merker his favorite horn player. Commercially, Merker recorded jingles for Marlboro, Coca-Cola, McDonald‚Äôs, Budweiser, and United Airlines. At Chicago's Universal Studios, a band set-up that became known as the \\"Ethel Merker Flying Wedge\\" arranged Merker on horn in the front of the band, with additional rows behind her of two trombones, three trumpets, four woodwinds, five rhythm, six violins, and seven low strings. Merker is the only woman to have her embouchure featured in the book Photo Study of 40 Virtuoso Horn Players‚Äô Embouchures, published in 1970 by Philip Farkas. In the early 1990s, Merker worked on the design and development of new models of horns with the Frank Holton Company, resulting in Holton's release of the Ethel Merker \\"Merker- Matic\\" series of horn models. The Merker-Matic was a Kruspe-wrap dual bore double horn that offered a variety of bell options and featured mechanical valve linkages. The Merker series horns are now discontinued. Merker taught at Indiana University, DePaul University, the VanderCook College of Music, Northwestern University, and Valparaiso University. Her students included Former Professor of Horn at the University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music and Former Second Horn of the Philadelphia Orchestra Randy Gardner, American horn player and historical horn maker Lowell Greer, and Associate Principal Horn of the Minnesota Orchestra Herbert Winslow.

While technically classed as a regiment of marines for much of its existence, as James possessed no navy it generally fought as conventional infantry. Its colonel was James's illegitimate son Henry Fitzjames, Grand Prior of the Knights of Malta, although in practice field command was delegated to an experienced lieutenant- colonel. Following Jacobite defeat in Ireland the regiment was reformed in France, seeing heavy fighting on the Continent as part of the Irish Brigade. In 1703 Nicholas Fitzgerald became colonel, and the regiment was designated the R√©giment de Fitzgerald; it finally became the R√©giment d'Odonnell under Daniel O'Donnell, before disbandment in 1715. History =Williamite War in Ireland= The Grand Prior's Regiment had its origin in the huge expansion of the Irish Army authorised by the Lord Deputy, the Earl of Tyrconnell, in the months following the deposition of James in the Glorious Revolution. In January 1689 warrants were issued for the recruitment of 40,000 levies, organised along standard regimental lines and almost entirely Catholic. By spring 1689, the army theoretically had around 36,000 men, although experienced officers remained in short supply. The regiment is usually stated to have been raised in Ireland in early 1689, though one of its officers noted it was \\"one of the oldest in [Ireland], giving their precedence only to the Guards\\", raised in 1662. During the Williamite War it was initially commanded by a Scot, Brigadier Robert Ramsay, and served at Derry, where Ramsay was killed in early May leading an attack on Windmill Hill. While most of the Irish Jacobite regiments were poorly documented, the movements of the Grand Prior's are known in some detail thanks to the diary of John Stevens, an English Catholic who fled to France after James's deposition. He was later sent to Ireland and in August 1689 was introduced to Fitzjames by Ignatius Usher, a captain in the Grand Prior's, which had returned from Derry and was now under Fitzjames' command. Fitzjames \\"immediately gave me the promise of a lieutenancy in his regiment, and a few days after delivered me the commission\\"; Stevens shortly afterwards joined the regiment at Drogheda. At the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, Stevens recorded that the appearance of the routed Jacobite cavalry caused the Grand Prior's to \\"[take] to their heels [...] I wondered what madness possessed our men to run so violently nobody pursuing them\\". The regiment gradually reassembled at Limerick; Stevens noted that without having even made contact with the enemy it had been reduced from 800 to 300 men, of whom only half had weapons, and its officers' baggage had been plundered twice by members of their own army. The Jacobites were nevertheless able to stabilise the situation and in September 1690 the regiment was particularly commended for its role in the successful Jacobite defence of Limerick, quartering in the town during the winter. In May 1691, Fitzjames having left for France, the regiment was temporarily placed in the command of Brigadier Richard Talbot, Tyrconnell's illegitimate son. It was subsequently present at the 2nd Siege of Athlone, and fought in the heavy Jacobite defeat at Aughrim on 12th July. Following Aughrim, the remnants of the army retreated to Limerick; under the terms of the subsequent Treaty of Limerick, which gave Jacobite soldiers the choice of disbanding, entering French service, or joining William's army, 249 men of the regiment chose to leave for France. By 1st November the last Irish troops left Limerick for Cork, where transports would take them to France; it was estimated that 5,650 of the Irish had embarked, a large number having deserted en route to Cork. =In France= The Jacobite army was in an extremely poor state on arrival in France and was completely reorganised on terms largely dictated by the French, despite James's attempts to preserve its autonomy. Fitzjames' regiment was, however, reconstituted, although it is unclear how many of its personnel had served with it in Ireland other than some of its officers. Nicholas Fitzgerald, who had served with the regiment since its formation, was commissioned lieutenant-colonel. Following its reorganisation, the regiment saw \\"a good deal of fighting\\" on the Continent during the Nine Years' War, notably on campaign in Germany. Under the terms of the 1697 Peace of Ryswick which concluded the war, the Grand Prior's was one of the few regiments to survive the disbandment of most of James's army in exile. Incorporated into the French Army's Irish Brigade, it was renamed the Regiment of Albemarle after another of Fitzjames' titles, and personnel from the disbanded Regiment of Dublin were incorporated in it. Luzzara, 1702; the regiment, marked \\"Albemarle\\", is shown towards the right of the French lines In 1702, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the regiment was commended for its role at Luzzara, where it took extremely heavy casualties including many officers. Fitzjames died in December 1702 and the following year Fitzgerald was commissioned colonel, the regiment becoming the Regiment de Fitzgerald in line with usual French practice. Fitzgerald was wounded and taken prisoner at Oudenarde in 1708, dying a few weeks later at Ghent. He was succeeded as colonel by Daniel O'Donnell, who had served with the regiment since 1692. Under O'Donnell the regiment participated in several of the war's major battles, including Malplaquet. It was eventually disbanded in 1715, with its remaining men being incorporated in the Irish Brigade regiments of Lee and O'Brien. Equipment and colours Stevens recorded that while in Ireland the regiment were \\"clothed in red lined white, all but the drums, who are blue\\". He described the colours as bearing \\"a flaming city, and this motto, The fruits of Rebellion.\\" References Sources   * * Category:Military units and formations established in 1689 Category:Disbanded marine forces Category:Irish regiments in European armies Category:French regiments of the Ancien R√©gime Category:Irish regiments in French service Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1715 ","title":"Lord Grand Prior's Regiment"},{"id":"65436029","text":"Helen Kotas Hirsch (1916December 15, 2000) was an American horn player who played principal horn in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Her musical studies began at age six, when she started studying piano. In high school, she initially played cornet before taking up the horn. Kotas studied horn with Frank Kyrl, of the Chicago Symphony, through high school and while attending Lyons Township Junior College. Kotas attended college at the University of Chicago, where she earned an undergraduate degree in psychology in 1936. While there, she began studying horn with Louis Dufrasne, of the Chicago NBC Orchestra. Kota's first horn was a Wunderlich single F horn, given to her by her father. In college, she began playing a Geyer double horn, given to her by her sister. She continued to play Geyer horns and mouthpieces throughout her career.  Career  Kotas's orchestral experience began when she was a teenager. At age 14, she joined the Women‚Äôs Symphony Orchestra of Chicago as fourth horn, moving to first horn the following year. She also played first horn in the West Suburban Symphony Orchestra. After college, Kotas played with the Chicago Civic Orchestra and had her first engagement playing with the Chicago Symphony as an extra under conductor Frederick Stock. In 1940 and 1941, Kotas played summer tours in Leopold Stokowski's All-American Youth Orchestra. After auditioning for Fritz Reiner in 1940, Kotas won the position of third horn with the Pittsburgh Symphony. When Philip Farkas resigned from the Chicago Symphony the following year in 1941, Stock wanted Kotas for the Chicago position. Stock contacted Reiner, who agreed to let Kotas out of her contract. Prior to Kotas's appointment as principal horn with the Chicago Symphony, the only woman to serve as a principal player in that or any other major U.S. orchestra played the harp. James Chambers succeeded Kotas as third horn in Pittsburgh. Kotas joined the Chicago Symphony beginning with the 1941‚Äì42 season and remained in the position of principal horn until 1947. In 1947, Philip Farkas returned to the orchestra as principal horn under conductor Artur Rodzinski. Rodzinski used a loophole in Kotas‚Äôs contract to move her to another position in the horn section, and after sitting out, Kotas left the orchestra in 1948.‚ÄúThe Singing Style of the Bohemians‚Äù ‚Äì A Study of the Bohemian Contributions to Horn Pedagogy, Including Western Perspectives on Czech Horn Playing and an Analysis of the Teachings of Zdenƒõk Divok√Ω at the Prague Academy of Performing Arts by Tiffany N.

In the 1920s he was regarded as one of the most important artists of Mecklenburg. After the 1930s Tschirch was viewed with skepticism for decades due to his affinity with National Socialism. The rediscovery of a major work in 2015 initiated an ongoing discussion and re-evaluation of the artist and his work.  Early years in the German Empire  From 1907 to 1912, Egon Tschirch attended three prestigious Art Academies in Berlin. Among his teachers were Bruno Paul and Anton von Werner. A study trip to Southern France and Tunisia in 1914 awakened his preference for vibrant colours. Tschirch fought in World War I and, after being injured, worked at the Imperial army press office in Berlin producing posters for the department of pictorial propaganda from 1916 to the end of the war. These posters featured darkly colored war targets with corresponding text and messages encouraging wartime perseverance. He returned to Rostock after the war.Egon Tschirch: Leben und Werk (Monograph), Kulturhistorische Gesellschaft Rostock e.V.

His productivity and willingness to experiment made him the most fitful yet successful artist in Mecklenburg in the early Golden Twenties. Some outstanding examples of the paintings are Boats with Fishermen (1922) at the Rostock Museum of Cultural History and Warnow Fishermen (1923) at Rostock Art Gallery. In 1923, Tschirch created his expressionist cycle of paintings centered around the biblical Song of Songs. These long-forgotten works of art were rediscovered in 2015 after being lost for more than 90 years. Tschirch is also considered a master of portrait art who was able to capture the character and traits of his clients extremely concisely. Several members of Mecklenburg's bourgeoisie were portrayed by him. Examples of this are the portrait Max Samuel (1920) and the series of twenty Heads (1921) that are only labeled with numbers.

His art, objective and realistic, fit the times and was mostly appreciated. In the emerging era of Nazism, Egon Tschirch identified for a long time with national conservative views. In 1931 he joined the NSDAP. Several works on commission in the service of the Nazi regime and persistently plentiful assignments from private individuals enabled him to live a comfortable life until the beginning of the Second World War. Only when the systematic extermination of the Jews began and his hometown was destroyed in 1942 did Tschirch criticise National Socialism and become inwardly distant. He finally turned away from the regime. In St. Mary's Church in Rostock there still hangs a famous painting from this time depicting the church surrounded by the city‚Äôs ruins. In 1948, Egon Tschirch died childless in Rostock at the age of 58. The destroyed town (Rostock)(1942)  Reception  In the summer of 1937 there were discussions about whether some of his works from the early 1920s should be classified as Degenerate art and removed from the State Museum Schwerin. The intervention of advocates on his behalf prevented this. Tschirch was treated with caution and largely forgotten in East Germany. The rediscoveries of the Song of Songs cycle and the Portrait Max Samuel in 2015 set in motion a new contemporary debate. The first monograph on his life and work was published in 2020. From today's perspective, the contradictions between Tschirch's work and mentality are evident. His art, which by far surpasses its artist in character, remains of enormous importance for Mecklenburg and beyond.

It was painted in the first quarter of the 17th century, probably around 1610, and is currently housed at the Museum of Art in Toledo, Ohio. After having been exposed in Toledo as an \\"anonymous loan,\\" the Museum directory opted for the purchase, influenced by the reaction of the public. The painting was acquired by the Toledo Museum of Art in 2003. Summer Landscape with Harvesters might be part of one of the series dedicated to the four seasons started by de Momper in 1615, of which Landscape with Skaters is part. Painting The picture is an earthy depiction of nature and humanity, both at ease and engaged in physical exertion. Some people are working hard in the fields, others are having a picnic, others still are in the middle of a romantic encounter. Over seventy figures are depicted in the painting, and their activities reveal a cohesive and studied narrative. Some farmers are cutting off the grain, while others roll it into sheaves. Wagons are carrying the harvest to town, where it will be shipped to overseas markets, as indicated by the ships sailing in the faraway sea. To the left, people are relaxing in the shade of the crop. They are eating food and drinking at a picnic. On the road, a dog greets a man walking up in front of his empty wagon to the viewer, and a woman sets the basket she is carrying on the ground, to rest a while on her way home. The painting is a large vista of fields that recede to the background, giving way to a gulf and the ocean. By using a \\"mutually reinforcing geometry of diagonals that intersect with three distinct color bands [yellow, green, blue],\\" de Momper allowed his composition to \\"convincingly lead the eye deep into the picture.\\" Summer Landscape with Harvesters is considered one of many collaborations between de Momper of Jan Brueghel the Elder. The two collaborated on several occasions, with de Momper always painting the landscape and Brueghel taking care of the staffage, usually the animated figures. Provenance The painting was acquired by the Toledo Museum of Art in March 2003 at an yearly old master fair in Maastricht. The painting previously was part of private collections in Spain, and was possibly part of the collection decorating the Torre de la Reina in the Alc√°zar de Madrid, which reached Madrid from Flanders in the early 17th century.

Early life  Reinhart was born on December 20, 1941, in Roselle, New Jersey,Reinhart, Carole Dawn, AEIOU, in: Austria-Forum, das Wissensnetz, 25. M√§rz 2016 the daughter of C. O. Reinhart and Mabel Geiger Reinhart. Her mother, a trombonist, gave Reinhart her first brass lessons on the cornet aged two and a half years old. By the age of seven she was playing trumpet duets with her brother, Rolfe, who was known as a \\"boy trumpeter\\" and also received scholarships to study music. At age 10, Reinhart received her first scholarship to the Julliard School of Music in New York. She was the first woman to be honoured as a bandleader for the Salvation Army. At the age of sixteen she gave her first international concert in Toronto. As a result, she received a scholarship to the University of Miami and was named \\"National College Queen\\" in 1960. A Fulbright Scholarship enabled her to travel Austria to study with at the Vienna Music Academy, where she was the first female brass player to graduate with 'Distinction'. Reinhart returned to America to complete her studies at the Julliard School of Music. She was first trumpet in the Julliard Orchestra under Jean Morel, and was graduated with a BA and an MA.  Career  Reinhardt's career continued after university, with work in television programs and in orchestras across the USA. Television work included: Fanfare - a musical variety series broadcast in 1965 hosted by Al Hirt; in one episode of To Tell the Truth in 1961; from 1974 she appeared in the series Musik! Musik! In 1971 she moved to Berlin, where she performed with the Deutsche Oper Berlin and continued her international concert career. Reinhardt gave the premiere performance of Gottfried von Einem's Geistliche Sonate (Sacred Sonata) in 1974. She recorded classical trumpet literature with the Munich Philharmonic and German Bach Soloists. In 1983 she was appointed as professor of trumpet at the Vienna Music Academy; from 1996-8 she was also head of the department for wind and percussion instruments. She recorded a number of solo albums and was featured as trumpet soloist on an album by soprano Lucia Popp, Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen, including Bach's cantata, where her style was described as \\"excellent\\" and \\"beautifully controlled\\". In 1996 she ended her solo career, but continued to teach at the Vienna Music University until 2011. In 2009 Reinhart wrote her dissertation on Women Brass Musicians: Historical Documentation and the Influence of the International Women's Brass Conference on their Profession. During her career Reinhart was discriminated against because she was a woman. Critics were dismissive of her and often focused their reviews on her appearance rather than her musicality. When she became engaged to fellow trumpeter , critics suggested that he was the reason for her success, rather than her own achievements.

Robert Corron, who was one of Kane County's first settlers, claimed the farm in 1835 and gradually purchased its land from the government over the 1840s. Corron and his family originally lived in a log cabin on the site, but in the early 1950s they built a brick farmhouse; the house's design blends elements of the Italianate and Early Classical Revival styles. The farm also has a workers' house from the 1880s with an I-house plan, a common vernacular type in the Midwest at the time. Other buildings on the farm include a dairy barn with a silo, a horse barn, a hog house, a chicken coop and feed house, a milk house, and two corn cribs. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 21, 2018.

The vinyl album uses out-of-context recordings of political figures apparently responding to interview questions fabricated by the comedians. Television comedy writers Earle Doud and Alen Robin conduct some of the \\"interviews\\"; other interviewers are news announcers John Cameron Swayze and Westbrook Van Voorhis, with WPIX anchorman John St. Leger, all of whom were recorded speaking questions written by Doud and Robin. Audio tape was edited to bring together the comedy questions and the recordings of political people, with laugh track sound effects added by Bob Prescott. Produced by Robin and Doud, the album was Doud's followup to the massively popular The First Family comedy album of 1962, featuring Vaughn Meader voicing impressions of John F. Kennedy. The First Family had gained Doud a Grammy Award, but LBJ Ranch was nominated and did not win. Two years later, Doud and Robin made another, similar album titled Lyndon Johnson's Lonely Hearts Club Band, published by Atco Records. Production In 1964 when they started the project, Earle Doud and Alen Robin were both veterans of television comedy writing. Doud had written funny lines for Jack Paar, Jackie Gleason, Jonathan Winters, Ernie Kovacs and Johnny Carson, while Robin was a long-time writer on The Tonight Show who had also supplied comedy hooks for Cliff Arquette, Fred Allen and Steve Allen. Doud and Robin were frustrated with the anonymous work of comedy writing, and they were looking for a way to earn greater fame. Doud had already come near stardom when he helped impersonator Vaughn Meader become famous overnight with the 1962 comedy album The First Family, which poked gentle fun at the Kennedy family. Robin said he was searching for a way to make more money; he found it difficult to consort with TV stars in the way they expected of him. Robin and Doud gathered many recorded interviews of political figures, their collection eventually amounting to of magnetic tape. They had originally intended to introduce the album earlier but were prevented by the daunting task of editing the recordings. Broadcast announcer Chester Santon later speculated that Robin and Doud first attempted to compile recordings of the Lyndon B. Johnson family alone, but cast their net wider when they did not find enough funny material. Robin and Doud finally settled on an album containing American political figures, which meant they would have to set aside recordings of German rocketry pioneer Wernher von Braun, and Prince Philip of England. Nelson Rockefeller was \\"interviewed\\" on the album Robin met with Doud nearly every evening for 13 months in Doud's New York City house in the East 60s of the Upper East Side neighborhood, to ferret out the best potential comedy material. They were watched by Doud's pet kinkajou (a small rainforest mammal) which was sometimes intoxicated on alcohol supplied by Doud. They looked for recordings that would fit with the idea of a press conference or interview. Doud said, \\"We tried to stay away from the tapes of speeches because we wanted the tone which comes only in interviews.\\" They had funny possibilities with words spoken by ex-President Harry S. Truman, but the recording quality was poor, so they decided not to use it. More humorous moments were captured in recordings of Ambassador Adlai Stevenson II, but he died in July 1965, so Doud felt it would be in bad taste to include him. With Truman and Stevenson removed, Doud and Robin's intended balance of five Republicans and five Democrats was reduced to five and three. By August 1965 the two producers had a script written, and they held a recording session for the announcer voices on August 25, 1965, in New York City. Graphic artist Frank Frazetta prepared eight caricatures of the eight political figures heard on the album. He superimposed the images onto Peter Levy's photograph of Doud and Robin playing chess, such that eight of the chess pieces had caricature heads. The lower right chessboard square contains Frazetta's name. Lady Bird Johnson's greeting was used for the album title. Doud said that all of the answers heard on the album were taken whole from source material rather than cut up and reassembled word-by-word. The title of the album is a recorded snippet of Lady Bird Johnson conducting a tour of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Texas home which is now a national historic park. Doud and Robin used her voice to answer a comedic question about what the native Americans might have said to Christopher Columbus. Another contrast used for laughs by the writers was wealthy Governor Nelson Rockefeller being asked what he gave his wife for their anniversary, with the recorded reply, \\"The State of New York, the State of New Jersey, the State of Connecticut... and all the people in those states.\\" Reception When it came out in November 1965, excerpts from the 33 rpm, 12-inch microgroove LP were played on US radio stations in many metropolitan areas, which stimulated sales. The album sold so well that Capitol executive Brown Meggs said in November 1965 that they were planning on selling 4 million units through the end of the year, while Cash Box magazine reported they had already sold 5 million. On Christmas Day 1965, Billboard magazine listed \\"Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!\\" at number 3 of the top selling LPs in the US, following Whipped Cream & Other Delights by Herb Alpert at number 1, and The Sound of Music film soundtrack album. This was the fifth week LBJ Ranch had been on the chart. The album stayed on the chart for 25 weeks in total. Cash Box described how some of the larger major metropolitan radio stations were hesitant to broadcast excerpts because of the fear that the material was violating the rights of the politicians. Capitol Records had already given the album to their 40-person legal team who had cleared it as fair use because it was a parody. Radio stations playing the comedy tracks included WMCA in New York, WLS and WCFL in Chicago, WJW in Cleveland, WWDC in Baltimore/Washington D.C., KJR in Seattle, KLIF in Dallas, and three in Atlanta: WSB, WYZE and WQXI. Meggs said that the album ran into \\"stiff resistance\\" from Los Angeles radio stations. Senator Everett Dirksen, parodied on the album, reportedly bought \\"stacks\\" of it to give as Christmas gifts. After the album peaked in December, newly elected New York Mayor John Lindsay hired Doud and Robin to write a funny speech for him to deliver at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in March. \\"Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Comedy Album. For the 8th Annual Grammy Awards held in March 1966, Doud and Robin were up against albums by Godfrey Cambridge and the Smothers Brothers, and they were competing with Doud's former colleagues from the 1962 album The First Family: producers Bob Booker and George Foster with their new album You Don't Have to Be Jewish. In the end, Bill Cosby won the comedy award for Why Is There Air? The National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) listed LBJ Ranch in a group of six nominated for the Best-Selling Comedy Album of 1965, and Cash Box later reported it certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

As a musician he is known for The Sharing Patrol, Dear John Letters, The Tripwires, Mark Pickerel & His Praying Hands, as well as being a touring guitar player and keyboardist for Neko Case. Sangster‚Äôs producer and engineer credits include The Briefs, Mudhoney, The Posies, Supersuckers, and many others. He currently works primarily out of Crackle & Pop, a studio that he cofounded and operates along with Andrew Smith in Seattle‚Äôs Ballard neighborhood. = The Sharing Patrol = The Sharing Patrol began on Lopez Island while Johnny Sangster and drummer Jonathan Stibbard were in high school. Following high school Sangster relocated to Copenhagen, Denmark, followed shortly after by Stibbard, where The Sharing Patrol met bassist Henrik Tuxen. The Sharing Patrol released several albums on independent record labels in Scandinavia before moving to the major label EMI. For their final album, Take You There, in 1996, The Sharing Patrol decided to return to their hometown of Seattle to record with producer Kurt Bloch of The Fastbacks and Young Fresh Fellows. = Return to Seattle and production = Following the experience of recording Take You There, Sangster moved back to Seattle, WA in 1997. In Seattle he decided to focus on the production and engineering side of the music industry. Upon returning to Seattle he began engineering records at Egg Studio with Conrad Uno. From there he began to produce more sessions, finding his experience and skill as a musician a boon to communicating with bands. Sangster later worked out of other Seattle studios such as Avast, Soundhouse, and Electrokitty. In 2006 he opened Crackle & Pop studio in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. Crackle & Pop was originally envisioned as a smaller space to record overdubs and mix records, but due to demand Crackle & Pop quickly grew past its original vision. In 2018 Crackle & Pop expanded into a larger space in order to accommodate full bands and larger groups. The expansion of Crackle & Pop was possible due to inheriting equipment from the recently closed Egg Studio including a Spectra Sonics recording console that originally belonged to the Stax Records studios as well as several vintage tape machines. The new expanded Crackle & Pop features a full wall mural by Austin, Texas artist and musician Tim Kerr. Crackle & Pop also continues to produce their ‚ÄúLive at Crackle & Pop,‚Äù a series of intimate live videos with artists such as Ken Stringfellow, Rusty Willoughby, and Bronwynne Brent, as well as many other local Seattle artists. = 2016-present = In addition to producing records and expanding Crackle & Pop, Sangster was also a member of the Case/Lang/Veirs touring band during their 2016/2017 world tour. Following that tour, he has continued as a member of Neko Case‚Äôs touring band in support of her album Hell-On in 2018/19. He regularly performs with The Tripwires and several other bands in Seattle. Sangster released his first full solo album entitled The Moon on the Ceiling & Other Night Hags in 2018.

(1982) Las Coyas y Pallas del Tahuantinsuyo. pg: 217,305,306,319  Inca Imperial Origin  Huayna Capac, according to a consensus of chroniclers, \\"left a very numerous descendants\\", obviously of more natural than legitimate children. Of the children, especially if they managed to have figures as Hu√°scar and Atahualpa, it is less difficult to specify maternal origin. Of women it is more complex. It has been possible to establish that Francisca Coya was one of the Inca's daughters, but regarding the mother, opinions vary: for some, Francisca is legitimate as the daughter of the Coya-wife, while for others, she was the daughter of a concubine. In any case, \\"the children of the Inca were not sought lawsuits of maternal origin: they were children of 'the Inca', and that's enough\\".  Biography  After the death of Atahualpa at the hands of the Spanish, Sebasti√°n de Benalcaz√°r and Diego de Sandoval y la Mota marched to the region of San Miguel de Piura. It was then that in 1535 in Chaparra, in the Ca√±aris region, in the western foothills of the Andes, the Spanish found a group of indigenous people who were hiding and protecting Atahualpa's sisters: Toctochembo, Marcachembom, Ascarpe and Francisca (her autochthonous name is unknown), also daughters of Huayna C√°pac. She and her people were running away from Cuzco, at the entrance of the Spanish. This effort was in vain because Francisca was captured (along with her other sisters) and taken to Sebastian de Benalc√°zar, who \\"gave her to Captain Diego de Sandoval\\". The Incan noble became pregnant and marched with Sandoval first to Quito where she gave birth to their first and only child. Later she accompanied him to Popay√°n, where she lived close to one of her sisters (one whose Benalc√°zar had taken for himself). Francisca, who was called 'La Coya' by the first \\"vecinos\\" (meaning \\"neighbours\\", a name given to the first citizens with rights) of Quito, was born in Cuzco around 1515. She was the legitimate daughter of Huayna C√°pac: \\"her mother was carried on, for being an older and principal woman in Cuzco, according to the testimony of Indian Pedro Inga, in Bogot√° in 1575\\", \\"the Indian Catalina, who saw her birth and was her maid, declared in Tunja in 1575, when she was 70 years old: 'Guaynacaba her father, put her in another house, where she lived and kept the rest of his daughters and maidens'\\". \\"It was said that when La Coya went to mass, all the chiefs and women of the provinces of Quito accompanied her. That when she left the city they carried her on and that she was accompanied by two thousand to three thousand Indians\\". According to witnesses of that time, they said that the Chiefs of Quito extended blankets, feathers and flowers on the way to go, so that her feet did not touch the ground. This description coincides with the interpretation John Hemming gave: \\"the natives of Quito venerated her with pathetic passion\\", for the rituals and the customs of the time meant for the women of the Inca elite. The women of the Inca elite were refined ladies educated for their societal roles and they were treated accordingly by the people who had great respect for them.Herrero S, P. (2017) Las Mujeres en el Virreinato del Per√∫. p.7 IX Congreso Virtual sobre Historia de las Mujeres.  Offspring  In Quito in 1536, Francisca Coya gave birth to Eugenia de Sandoval Inca, who later lived in Popay√°n with her parents and later in Anserma, together with her father shortly after her mother's death in 1544. It is Eugenia who would receive in 1545 the Royal Certificate of Legitimization of Charles V Holy Roman Emperor at the request of \\"proof\\" ('probanza') of her father, Diego de Sandoval. Eugenia became married in 1550, at the age of 14, to Captain Gil de Rengifo Pantoja, born in √Åvila, Spain, leaving numerous descendants in Ecuador and Colombia. Eugenia died before 1575.  Genealogical trajectory  Starting from the Inca Emperor Huayna C√°pac. Francisca Coya (daughter of the Inca Emperor), slave-wife of the Spanish conqueror Diego de Sandoval, gives birth to Eugenia de Sandoval Inca (the Inca's granddaughter) in Quito in 1536. Eugenia de Sandoval Inca got legitimized by the Spanish King and became wife of the colonizer Gil de Rengifo; they only had one daughter, Mar√≠a Rengifo y Sandoval (great- granddaughter of the Inca), who was born in Anserma and became the wife of the Spanish Vicente Henao Tamayo. Of them, Melchor Henao Rengifo (great-great- grandson of the Inca), was born, in Anserma, around 1572. He married in Cali, around 1609, with Mar√≠a Vivas. Gregorio Henao Vivas (fourth grandson of the Inca), is born in Cali around 1610. He moved to the city of Antioquia where he married Jacoba V√°squez Guadramiros. and so on. From Gregorio Henao Vivas, it is easy to follow the descendants of the Coya Francisca in Colombia, in the book entitled: \\"Genealogies of Antioquia and Caldas\\", by Gabriel Arango Mej√≠a. Characters such as ex president Roberto Urdaneta Arbel√°ez, archbishops Arturo Duque Villegas, An√≠bal Mu√±oz Duque.

But also the historian Lucas Fern√°ndez de Piedrahita The historical projection of cultural values inherited to her descendants in Ecuador, such as the ex presidents Luis Cordero, Juan Le√≥n Mera, Antonio Borrero Cort√°zar, is the most important feature of Do√±a Francisca Coya. Among other Ecuadorian historical figures that descend from her are: Luis A. Martinez, Miguel Angel Le√≥n Pont√≥n, Octavio Cordero Palacios, Alberto Maria Ordonez Crespo, Carlos Concha Torres, Luis Quirola Sa√°, Emiliano Crespo Astudillo, Jose Maria Borrero Baca, Alfonso Borrero Moscoso, Manuel Borrero Gonz√°lez, Vicente Salazar y Cabal, Jos√© Gabriel Pino Roca, Pedro Cocha Torres, etc. The genealogical works demonstrate how the Incan blood line of Francisca enriched the elite (high and middle-high classes) of colonial and republican Ecuadorian and Colombian societies.

Even before women's suffrage in Rhode Island efforts took off, women were fighting for equal male suffrage during the Dorr Rebellion. Women raised money for the Dorrite cause, took political action and kept members of the rebellion in exile informed. An abolitionist, Paulina Wright Davis, chaired and attended women's rights conferences in New England and later, along with Elizabeth Buffum Chace, founded the Rhode Island Women's Suffrage Association (RIWSA) in 1868. This group petitioned the Rhode Island General Assembly for an amendment to the state constitution to provide women's suffrage. For many years, RIWSA was the major group providing women's suffrage action in Rhode Island. In 1887, a women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution came up for a voter referendum. The vote, on April 6, 1887, was decisively against women's suffrage. Women's suffrage efforts in Rhode Island continued to fight on, despite setbacks. The suffrage movement gained more publicity from Alva Belmont, who hosted a well-attended series of lectures at her Marble House mansion in 1909. Belmont, who also funded the work of Alice Paul, helped initiate a 1915 cross-country trip to deliver a petition to President Woodrow Wilson and Congress. Driving and working as the mechanic on that trip were two Swedish-American suffragists from Rhode Island. In 1913, the Rhode Island Union of Colored Women's Clubs, at the urging of Bertha G. Higgins, became the largest women's group to endorse women's suffrage in the state. In 1915, pro- suffrage governor, Robert Livingston Beeckman, helped initiate the efforts to pass a presidential suffrage bill. The bill passed in 1917, allowing women to be able to vote for the first time in Rhode Island, even if it was on a limited basis. On January 6, 1920, Rhode Island became the twenty-fourth state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment.  Early efforts  Excerpt from The Una, women's rights publication in Rhode Island. Women in Rhode Island were involved in fighting for suffrage for men during the Dorr Rebellion. Even though the rebellion was a call for equal suffrage for men, women were very involved in \\"political agitation on behalf of disenfranchised males.\\" Women founded \\"Dorrite societies\\" to promote reforms to male suffrage in the state. They also made up half of the public suffrage meetings held for the cause. Several women had significant roles both during and after the rebellion, including Francis Harriet Whipple Green, Almira Howard, Abby Lord, Ann Parlin, and Catherine Williams. Parlin asserted the right of women to criticize the government. Williams corresponded with Thomas Dorr and provided him with information. Women also served as contact points between the exiled Dorrite men. Women were also leaders and active participants in Rhode Island politics through the abolitionist movement. Paulina Wright Davis was an abolitionist who moved to Providence. In 1850 Davis was the chair of the National Women's Rights Convention in Worchester, Massachusetts. Davis gave the opening address of the convention. She also began to publish The Una, a newspaper supporting women's rights in 1853. During the Civil War, women throughout Rhode Island became involved with organizations to aid the war effort. One group involved in the war effort was the Providence Ladies Volunteer Relief Association. This organization, along with other similar groups in the city, organized volunteers working to support the war effort and ensured that soldiers and hospitals were adequately supplied. On October 23, 1868, suffragists, Elizabeth Buffum Chace and Davis, attended the organizational meeting of the New England Woman's Suffrage Association (NEWSA). The women came back from the meeting inspired to create the Rhode Island Women's Suffrage Association (RIWSA), which formed on December 11, 1868. RIWSA was affiliated with NEWSA. Members of RIWSA immediately began work on petitioning the Rhode Island General Assembly for a women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution. Clubwomen and members of the Rhode Island Women's Christian Temperance Union worked together to help influence laws to protect women in the state. In 1884, the Rhode Island General Assembly voted to allow RIWSA to hold a women's suffrage convention in the Old State House. At the convention, Chace urged suffragists to keep pushing forward. Speakers, such as Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass also attended. Suffragists Letitia Lawton, Cora Mitchel, and Emeline Eldredge in 1907. Women's suffrage amendments were brought before the General Assembly for several years. In 1885, Representative Edward L. Freeman was influential in getting a bill through the Assembly. Another amendment bill passed the Assembly in 1886 and again 1887. At this point, it would go before the voters for a referendum. The suffragists only had twenty- nine days to campaign for a win. A headquarters, providing information and open twelve hours a day, was opened in Providence. Over ninety-two meetings were held during this time with well-known speakers from around the state and country. Suffragists campaigned around the state. Lillie B. Chace Wyman began to publish The Amendment to promote the amendment and women's suffrage. The vote took place on April 6, 1887, but the amendment failed by a vote of 6,889 for and 21,957 against. After the defeat of the amendment, Henry B. Blackwell suggested that suffragists in Rhode Island lobby for suffrage in presidential elections. Before women could vote in Rhode Island, they started running for office. Due to wording in the state constitution, women were only eligible to run for school committeewoman. Elizabeth Churchill, Sarah Doyle, and Rhoda Peckham all ran in 1873, though were not successful in winning office. In 1874, Anna E. Aldrich, Elizabeth C. Hicks and Abby D. Slocum were all successful in running for seats on the Providence School Committee. The first time the idea of presidential suffrage was brought before the General Assembly was in 1892 and it did not have much support. Blackwell brought up the idea again in 1902 and by 1903, a petition led to a bill for presidential suffrage in the Senate of the General Assembly. This bill did not leave the committee, however. Several more attempts were made to secure presidential suffrage in 1904 and 1905. In 1905, each lawmaker in the general assembly received a copy of The Woman Citizen on their desks. In 1906, the bill came before the General Assembly Senate and Senator Walter R. Stiness spoke out strongly in support of women's suffrage but it was held up in the House. Anti-suffragists testified against the presidential suffrage bill in 1907. Blackwell testified for the bill for the last time in 1909.  More visibility  Suffrage envoy Sara Bard Field with Ingeborg Kindstedt and Maria Kindberg from Rhode Island. Alva Belmont began to host suffrage events at her mansion, the Marble House. Around 1,000 people attended the lectures in August of 1909. The speakers included Anna Howard Shaw and a ninety-year old Julia Ward Howe. It was covered \\"extensively\\" in the press. Ida Husted Harper believed that Belmont's suffrage meetings helped promote the cause of women's suffrage. The fact that the press \\"accounts were dignified and accurate\\" was important because it differed from the usual ridicule that suffragists often received. In 1913, Bertha G. Higgins persuaded the Rhode Island Union of Colored Women's Clubs to endorse women's suffrage after her speech at their 11th annual conference. A white suffragist, Sara Algeo, who founded the Rhode Island Woman Suffrage Party in the same year said the Union's endorsement of women's suffrage was the \\"only endorsement received from any large body of women in the State before ratification took place.\\" African American women were welcome to join the Woman Suffrage Party in Rhode Island. In the fall of 1915, Algeo continued to reach out to Black women in the state through a reorganized Woman Suffrage Party group. \\"Votes for Women\\" cup and plate. Belmont held more women's suffrage speeches in 1914, this time called the Conference of Great Women. For the event, she served guests using \\"Votes for Women\\" dinnerware commissioned from John Maddock and Sons. Consuelo Vanderbilt, her daughter, spoke at the conference and people turned out to listen to her. The event helped to raise money for women's suffrage efforts. Alva Belmont was the \\"primary benefactor\\" of Alice Paul. In 1915, Belmont, working with the Congressional Union (CU), helped Paul get a 50,000 name petition from California to the United States Congress and the President. Belmont was in contact with two Swedish-American suffragists, Ingeborg Kindstedt and Maria Kindberg who were already in San Francisco for the Women Voters Convention and were going to buy a car and drive back to Rhode Island. Kindberg purchased an Overland automobile and drove, and Kindstedt worked as the mechanic for the trip. Sara Bard Field was the CU representative and did the press events as they traveled across the country, starting out on September 15. They drove across eighteen states in all kinds of weather and delivered the petition in time by December 6. When the petition was presented to President Woodrow Wilson, he was impressed by the number of signatures gathered.Signing women's suffrage act in Rhode Island, April 18, 1917 Governor Robert Livingston Beeckman suggested the presidential suffrage bill again in 1915. Suffragists in Rhode Island fought for the bill, bringing in legislators from states where women already had the vote to testify in front of the assembly. It was not successful, however. On February 8, 1917, the presidential suffrage bill was reintroduced in the General Assembly's Senate. Finally, the bill passed on April 17 and was signed the next day by the governor. In February and March of 1917, Elizabeth Upham Yates was teaching suffrage schools at the RIESA headquarters to prepare the new women voters. In August of 1917, Carrie Chapman Catt and James Henry Darlington spoke at a women's suffrage event in Newport. At the event, attended by both Black and white people, Catt and Darlington urged both men and women to continue fighting for women's suffrage. During World War I, suffragists in Rhode Island worked to support the war effort. The war work that suffragists did helped improve their standing in the eye of the public. Rhode Island ratified the Nineteenth Amendment on January 6, 1920. The ratification resolution was passed by a good majority in both the House and Senate of the General Assembly. Rhode Island was the twenty-fourth state to ratify the amendment. After getting the vote, places like Jamestown almost doubled their tallied votes.  Anti-suffragism in Rhode Island  In October of 1912, a branch of the Rhode Island Association in Opposition to Woman suffrage was formed in Newport. At the meeting, speakers emphasized that it was important to stop women's suffrage now, because it was difficult to disenfranchise women later. The wife of Governor Charles W. Lippitt, Margaret Farnum Lippitt, was an antisuffragist. In 1914 she testified against women's suffrage at the Rhode Island General Assembly's Senate Judiciary Committee. Another member of the family, Mary Lippitt Steedman, was also opposed to women's suffrage; but later voted, became active in politics and supported the Equal Rights Amendment.

Family John (II) was born into the so-called T√∫z (or Somogy) branch of the gens (clan) B≈ë, which originated from Somogy County, and was one of the ancient ethnic Hungarian kindreds which had participated in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in late 9th century. His father was Izs√©p, a confidant of Duke Coloman, King B√©la IV's younger brother. John had a brother Henry and an unidentified sister. John II had two sons ‚Äì Trepk and John III ‚Äì from his marriage with an unidentified noblewoman. Through Trepk, he was ancestor of the T√∫z de Lak family, along with other less significant families.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus B≈ë 1., Somogy branch 1‚Äì3.) Life Both Izs√©p and John participated in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241, where the Mongol invaders measuered heavy defeat on the Hungarian royal army. Both of them fought under the banner of Coloman. While Izs√©p was killed in the battle, John managed to survive, despite that his left leg was pierced by a spear. John inherited his father's possessions in Somogy County, including B≈ë ‚Äì the eponymous estate ‚Äì with its clan monastery, half of Magyari (today Buzs√°k) and a portion of Gyugy with accessories, which laid south to Somogyv√°r. John also owned portions in the nearby villages Szentm√°rton (today part of Mez≈ëcsokonya) and Bodrog. As a daughters' quarter, John handed over both properties to his unidentified sister. John sold the land Terebezd and the right of patronage over the B≈ë monastery to vice-judge royal Nicholas Tengerdi in 1257. John was selected an ad-litem arbiter during a division process of lands in 1254. By the next decade, he became one of the most prominent members of the local elite in Somogy County. He acted as co- judge in various lawsuits in the county, for instance in 1262, 1268‚Äì1269 and 1276‚Äì1277. Historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs argued John was one of the four noble judges () in Somogy County since the early 1260s, and functioned in this capacity in the aforementioned lawsuits. Following King B√©la and his son Duke Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the \\"royal servants\\", from then on known as noblemen in their Decree of 1267, the isp√°n (head) of Somogy County, Lawrence, son of Kem√©ny was commissioned to review the ownership of several possessions in the county, as one of the articles of the Decree of 1267 ordained that \\"the lands of the nobles, which thou art ours, the peoples of the queen's free villages, or the courtiers, or the castle folks, are occupied or kept occupied under any pretext, must be returned to these nobles\\". The assembly of Somogy County delegated five local nobles to the ad-litem court chaired by Lawrence, including John B≈ë at the first place, along with, for instance, his distant relative Stephen B≈ë. Throughout the year 1268, the six- member commission performed the task. According to historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs, the restitution of lands was biased towards them. For his loyal service, John was granted the other half of Magyari (prior to that, it belonged to the castle folks of Somogyv√°r) by B√©la IV in the same year. Sz≈±cs argued, the donation occurred at the request of John, as part of their restitution mandate in Somogy County. Whether John participated in any military campaigns during B√©la's reign following the Mongol invasion, it is uncertain, but presumable according to the wording of the letter of donation. B√©la's successor Stephen V confirmed the land donation regarding Magyari, but John ‚Äì for some reasons ‚Äì returned it to the castle folks of Somogyv√°r. Nevertheless, King Ladislaus IV donated whole Magyari with the neighboring swamps, islands and other accessories to John again in 1279. Joining the royalist army, John participated in the Battle of F√∂veny in late September 1274, where Henry K≈ëszegi was killed and Ladislaus' brother Andrew was liberated. As a result, he was also granted a portion in K√∂lked by the monarch in 1274. By that time, John also owned the villages Csavonya and ≈êr. In 1277, John was appointed to preside that commission which intended to investigate and curb the \\"robberies and thefts\\" in Somogy and Zala counties. These commissions set up throughout Hungary after Ladislaus IV was declared to be of age by the national diet. On 6 March 1278, John filed a lawsuit against Atyusz Hah√≥t before the court of isp√°n Denis P√©c and his cousin Gregory P√©c in Somogyv√°r. According to his charges, Atyusz unlawfully seized his village Csavonya and robbed his servants in ≈êr (both villages laid in southwestern part of Somogy County, far from the B≈ë clan's ancient centre). The subsequent court at Segesd on 25 March, chaired by Denis' successor Peter Cs√°k ruled in the favor of John based on an evidentiary procedure. John was also present at the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278. He faithfully served Ladislaus in the subsequent years too. He was killed in the battle at Lake H√≥d (near present-day H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely) against the rebellious Cumans around September‚ÄìOctober 1282.

Biography  Erik Bratt was responsible for the construction of Saab 35 Draken and Saab 37 Viggen by Saab AB, Link√∂ping Sweden. Bratt personified in Sweden the concept of the development and vast expansion of the Swedish Air Force in the shadow of the cold war and the nuclear arms race. = Personal = Bratt took flight certificate 1937 and underwent flight training in the Swedish Air Force from 1940 to 1942. He graduated in 1942 with a master's degree in engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology. He was employed at Skandinaviska Aero (later a part of Scandinavian Airlines) from 1942 to 1945 and from 1945 until his retirement in 1981 at Saab AB.

The project included as key parts development of supersonic flight and the delta wing concept. The client, the Swedish Air Force's desire (the Swedish Parliament's Defence decision 1958) in the 1950s to the 1970s was to swiftly attack strategic nuclear weapons-bombers such as Tupolev Tu-16 before they reached their targets. This with fast supersonic-delta wing-fighter aircraft such as Saab 35 Draken, where speed and preparedness were the key factors. The Swedish Air Force's need (the Swedish Parliament's Defence decision 1958) were landing operation-defenses over the surrounding seas with attack aircraft and ultra- fast reconnaissance aircraft planes such as the Saab 37 Viggen. Economy and materials engineering for friction heat of the atmosphere set the limit for speed. This generated large orders to build a very large air force and resources for development. = Awards = Bratt was awarded the Swedish Aeronautical Society's Thulin Medal in gold in 1972.Flygtekniska F√∂reningen ThulinmedaljenFlygtekniska F√∂reningen Thulinmedaljen Silvermedalj√∂rer-1944-2015 (PDF).

Synopsis  Widdershins is set in the magical city of the same name in Yorkshire, England, during the Industrial Revolution. While machines are replacing magic as the main tool of work in many other English cities, technology is banned in the city of Widdershins. The story begins with wizard and stage magician Sidney Malik, who accidentally and unwittingly steals small objects. For this he has been expelled from Widdershins University, and he becomes attached to a bracelet declaring him the King of Thieves. This brings him to the attention of Harriet \\"Harry\\" Barber, a treasure hunter and pipe smoker. The two team up to find a greater treasure. In the second story, two vagrants are forced to work with the city's bureaucracy to deal with \\"malforms,\\" the destructive results of summoning spells gone awry. Their comical attempts to deal with the malforms are connected to their employer, a local politician who is seeking to put greater restrictions on magic. Other storylines include an ex-soldier making a deal with a spirt of Envy over a musical rivalry and a supernatural tale of cake- making. Ashwin said in an interview that she started work on Widdershins around 2011, saying that \\"that there weren't quite enough fun, light-hearted adventure comics out there,\\" and writes each book to be a complete story \\"since I like resolution\\".  Reception  Widdershins, specifically Volume 7, won the British Fantasy Award for Best Comic/Graphic Novel in 2019. In a review for io9, Lauren Davis said that \\"Ashwin strikes a comedic tone with her comic that might be too light for some, but her worldbuilding is growing steadily more intriguing and her characters are fun to spend time with\\". Steve Morris, reviewing Widdershins for ComicsAlliance, described it as \\"a uniquely English sort of series, inspired as much by the Great British Bake Off as by classic novels gone by.\\"  Author  Kate Ashwin lives in West Yorkshire and is married. Her first comic was Darken, a D&D-based; comic with a main cast of antiheroes.

Noul originated from a tropical system in the Philippine Sea in September 15. The system was upgraded into a tropical depression later that same day by JMA, with JTWC and PAGASA following suit in 15:00 UTC, with PAGASA assigning the local name Leon to the developing tropical cyclone. As Leon was leaving the area of responsibility, Leon intensified into a tropical storm and was assigned the international name Noul by JMA. Noul would make landfall between Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø provinces in September 18 before degenerating into a remnant low over Thailand later that day. Noul caused six deaths and losses of US$175.2 million in Vietnam.http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-09/20/c_139382859.htm In Cambodia, Noul killed 12 people, in which 8 of them are killed by lightning strike on Battambang Province, 3 of them drowned in Preah Sihanouk and Koh Kong provinces, and a person from Pailin Province is missing and presumed dead. Meteorological history On the morning of September 15, the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for a tropical system forming in the Philippine Sea. Later that day, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression, with the JTWC following suit later at 15:00 UTC as they issued their first warning on the system as Tropical Depression 13W. Since the depression formed inside of the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), the PAGASA immediately issued a severe weather bulletin on the storm and named the system Leon. At 21:00 on September 16, the storm left the PAR and PAGASA issued its final warning on the system. At 03:00 UTC September 18, Noul made landfall between Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø provinces. At 9:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system. After being downgraded to a low pressure area (LPA), Noul followed a westward path and emerged in the Indian Ocean. Preparation and impacts A few days before the storm hit Vietnam, the Vietnamese government closed three airports and evacuated more than one million people in the affected areas. Noul damaged homes and knocked down trees and power lines in Hue, Vietnam. Heavy precipitation amounts peaking at 310 mm (12.20 inches) fell in Da Nang. The storm caused 6 deaths and 705 billion ƒë·ªìng (US$30.4 million) in damage.

Vurka is a branch of Peshischa Hasidism, as Israel Yitzhak Kalish was a leading disciple of Simcha Bunim of Peshischa (1765‚Äì1827). Following Simcha Bunim's death, he led a part of the divided Peschischa community, in Przysucha, later incorporating the community into his own Hasidic dynasty based in Warka. Like the other branches of Peshischa Hasidism, such as Kotzk and Ger, Vurka is known for their rationalistic and individualistic approach to Hasidism.  History  After Simcha Bunim of Peschischa's death in 1827, Peschischa became divided into several different sects led by Menachem Mendel of Kotzk and Avraham Moshe of Peshischa. Originally Kalish supported the secession of Simcha Bunim's son Avraham Moshe, however after his death a year later in 1828, he took over as Avraham Moshe's successor. Kalish moved the majority of the community to Warka, where he established his own Hasidic court. He also established a minor court in Przysucha, which he put Tzvi Hersh Mordechai Bonhardt in charge of. Israel Yitzhak Kalish‚Äôs eldest son Yaakov David (1814‚Äì1878) founded the Amshinov Hasidic dynasty, which still exits today in Israel and the United States as the only continuation of Vurka. Following Israel Yitzhak Kalish‚Äôs death, a large percentage of his followers accepted Shraga Fayvel Dancyger (the founder of Aleksander Hasidism) as Kalish's successor. Israel Yitzhak Kalish‚Äôs younger son, Mena·∏•em Mendel Kalish (1819‚Äì1868) reluctantly became the Vurka rebbe. Mena·∏•em Mendel‚Äôs son and successor Simcha Bunim Kalish (1851‚Äì1907) moved the community to Otwock, where he amassed several new followers. In 1905, he suddenly left for the Land of Israel, thus ending the Vurka dynasty.
