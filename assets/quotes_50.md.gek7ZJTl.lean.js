He also wrote the first full-length biography of Russian composer Alexander Scriabin. During the Allied Occupation of Japan, he was General Douglas MacArthur's personal Japanese language interpreter and aide-de-camp. Biography Bowers was born in Miami, Oklahoma. He graduated from Columbia University in 1935 and the Juilliard Graduate School of Music in 1939. Bowers taught at Hosei University in Tokyo from 1940 to 1941. After the surrender of Japan, he was the interpreter for the advance party of 150 US personnel which flew into the Atsugi airfield on 28 August 1945. As MacArthur's interpreter he lived at the American Embassy with the MacArthur family, and served as interpreter at the initial meeting between MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito. While an official censor for Japanese theater he became its champion. After the war he taught at the New School for Social Research, and at Kansas University as Distinguished Professor of Asian Studies. He also served as music editor or reviewer for various periodicals. Bowers became a respected authority on oriental art and culture, writing scholarly monographs on such subjects as Indian dance and Japanese theatre, as well as a definitive two- volume biography of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin. His book, Japanese Theatre, was published in 1952 and is highly recommended by James Michener, in his book on Japanese ukiyo-e prints, The Floating World, as \\"one of the foremost works of scholarship dealing with Japanese culture to come out of the occupation.\\" He was married from 1951-1966 to Indian writer Santha Rama Rau. They had one son who, according to his parents, traveled widely and lived an affluent vagabond existence. Bowers was interviewed for Columbia University's Oral History Project in 1960. He wrote the first full-length biography of Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872‚Äì1915) in two volumes (1970, 2nd edition 1996) and was a member of the Bagby Foundation for the Musical Arts in New York City. He died in New York City on 17 November 1999. Kabuki Bowers is known as The Man Who Saved Kabuki in Japan. While on his way to Indonesia in 1940, he visited Tokyo's Kabuki-za where he watched the famous Kanadehon Ch≈´shingura kabuki play, and was very moved by kabuki as an art form. Four years later he returned to Japan as General MacArthur's secretary during the American Occupation of Japan. At this time the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers thought kabuki should be banned for its portrayal of feudal values. Bowers was strongly against this, stating that \\"Kabuki is not only Japanese culture but world culture and must be preserved for the future.\\" He promoted kabuki plays and instructed that a \\"Dream Team\\" cast of big kabuki stars should be assembled to perform \\"Kanadehon Ch≈´shingura\\" in 1947. This performance and many others performed at the Tokyo Army College were a success, and the cast later performed the play in 1950 in East Coast venues across the US. Awards Bowers was awarded the Bronze Star in 1944, and an Oak Leaf Cluster in 1945. In 1985, Bowers was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the government of Japan.Pace, Eric. \\"Faubion Bowers, 82, Defender Of Kabuki in Occupied Japan\\", New York Times. November 22, 1999.

The sculpture shows a she- wolf suckling the mythical twin founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus. According to the legend, when King Numitor, grandfather of the twins, was overthrown by his brother Amulius in Alba Longa, the usurper ordered them to be cast into the Tiber River. They were rescued by a she-wolf that cared for them until a herdsman, Faustulus, found and raised them. The age and origin of the Capitoline Wolf are controversial. The statue was long thought to be an Etruscan work of the fifth century BC,(Lacus Curtius website) Rodolfo Lanciani, Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries ch. X; Musei Capitolini website ; Capitoline Museums:Exhibition \\"The Capitoline She-Wolf\\", June-October 2000 ; Lupa Capitolina Elettronica A site devoted to the Capitoline Wolf (in progress) with the twins added in the late 15th century AD, probably by sculptor Antonio Pollaiolo.\\"Sculpture\\" . The Oxford Encyclopedia of Classical Art and Architecture. Ed. John B. Hattendorf. Oxford University Press, 2007. However, radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating has found that the wolf portion of the statue is likely to have been cast between 1021 and 1153. The image of the she-wolf suckling Romulus and Remus is a symbol of Rome since ancient times, and one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology. Wiseman Remus preface pg xiii The sculpture has been housed since 1471 in the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Campidoglio (the ancient Capitoline Hill), Rome, Italy, and many replicas are in various places around the world. Description The sculpture is somewhat larger than life-size, standing high and long. The wolf is depicted in a tense, watchful pose, with alert ears and glaring eyes, which are watching for danger. By contrast, the human twins ‚Äì executed in a completely different style ‚Äì are oblivious to their surroundings, absorbed by their suckling.Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya. Gardner's Art Through the Ages, p. 241. Wadsworth, 2004. Attribution and dating The she-wolf from the legend of Romulus and Remus was regarded as a symbol of Rome from ancient times. Several ancient sources refer to statues depicting the wolf suckling the twins. Livy reports in his Roman history that a statue was erected at the foot of the Palatine Hill in 295 BC.Livy Ab Urbe Condita Book X ch.23 Pliny the Elder mentions the presence in the Roman Forum of a statue of a she-wolf that was \\"a miracle proclaimed in bronze nearby, as though she had crossed the Comitium while Attus Navius was taking the omens\\". Cicero also mentions a statue of the she-wolf as one of a number of sacred objects on the Capitoline that had been inauspiciously struck by lightning in 65 BC: \\"it was a gilt statue on the Capitol of a baby being given suck from the udders of a wolf.\\" In Catilinam 3.19. Cicero also mentions the wolf in De Divinatione 1.20 and 2.47.(L. Richardson Jr., \\"Ficus Navia\\"). The Capitoline Wolf was widely assumed to be the very sculpture described by Cicero, due to the presence of damage to the sculpture's paw, which was believed to correspond to the lightning strike of 65 BC. The 18th-century German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann attributed the statue to an Etruscan maker in the fifth century BC, based on how the wolf's fur was depicted.Francis Haskell, Nicholas Penny. Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture, 1500‚Äì1900, p. 241. Yale University Press, 1981. It was first attributed to the Veiian artist Vulca, who decorated the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and then reattributed to an unknown Etruscan artist of around 480‚Äì470 BC. Winckelmann correctly identified a Renaissance origin for the twins; they were probably added in 1471 AD or later.Adriano La Regina, \\"Roma, l'inganno della Lupa √® \\"nata\\" nel Medioevo. La Repubblica. 17 November 2006 During the 19th century, a number of researchers questioned Winckelmann's dating of the bronze. August Emil Braun, the secretary of the Archaeological Institute of Rome, proposed in 1854 that the damage to the wolf's paw had been caused by an error during casting. Wilhelm Fr√∂hner, the conservator of the Louvre, stated in 1878 that the style of the statue was attributable to the Carolingian art period rather than the Etruscan, and in 1885, Wilhelm von Bode also stated that he was of the view that the statue was most likely a mediaeval work. These views were largely disregarded, though, and had been forgotten by the 20th century. In 2006, Italian art historian Anna Maria Carruba and Etruscologist Adriano La Regina contested the traditional dating of the wolf on the basis of an analysis of the casting technique. Carruba had been given the task of restoring the sculpture in 1997, enabling her to examine how it had been made. She observed that the statue had been cast in a single piece, using a variation of the lost-wax casting technique. This technique was not used in Classical antiquity; ancient Greek and Roman bronzes were typically constructed from multiple pieces, a method that facilitated high-quality castings, with less risk than would be involved in casting the entire sculpture at once. Single-piece casting was, however, widely used in the Middle Ages to mould bronze items that needed a high level of rigidity, such as bells and cannons. Carruba argues, like Braun, that the damage to the wolf's paw had resulted from an error in the moulding process. In addition, La Regina, who is the state superintendent of Rome's cultural heritage, argues that the sculpture's artistic style is more akin to Carolingian and Romanesque art than that of the ancient world. Radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating were carried out at the University of Salento in February 2007 to resolve the question. The results revealed with an accuracy of 95.4% that the sculpture was crafted between the 11th and 12th centuries AD. History of the sculpture The sculpture in Musei Capitolini When the sculpture was first erected is unclear, but a number of mediaeval references mention a \\"wolf\\" standing in the Pope's Lateran Palace. In the 10th-century Chronicon of Benedict of Soracte, the monk chronicler writes of the institution of a supreme court of justice \\"in the Lateran Palace, in the place called the Wolf, viz, the mother of the Romans.\\" Trials and executions \\"at the Wolf\\" are recorded from time to time until 1438.Rodolfo Lanciani, New Tales of Old Rome, p. 38. Ayer Publishing, 1968. The 12th-century English cleric Magister Gregorius wrote a descriptive essay De Mirabilibus Urbis RomaeG. McN. Rushforth, \\"Magister Gregorius de Mirabilibus Urbis Romae: A New Description of Rome in the Twelfth Century\\", The Journal of Roman Studies 9 (1919, pp. 14‚Äì58), p. 28f. Magister Gregorius' description seems independent of the well- known topography Mirabilia Urbis Romae. and recorded in an appendix three pieces of sculpture he had neglected; one was the wolf in the portico, at the principal entrance to the Lateran Palace. He mentions no twins, for he noted that she was set up as if stalking a bronze ram that was nearby, which served as a fountain. The wolf had also served as a fountain, Magister Gregorius thought, but it had been broken off at the feet and moved to where he saw it.Lupa etiam quondam singulis mammis aquam abluendis manibus emittebat, sed nunc fractis pedibus a loco suo divulsa est The present-day Capitoline Wolf could not have been the sculpture seen by Benedict and Gregorius, if its newly attributed age is accepted, though it could have been a replacement for an earlier (now lost) depiction of the Roman wolf. In December 1471, Pope Sixtus IV ordered the present sculpture to be transferred to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill, and the twins were added some time around then. The Capitoline Wolf joined a number of other genuinely ancient sculptures transferred at the same time, to form the nucleus of the Capitoline Museum. Capitoline Wolf in Hamilton Gardens, Hamilton, New Zealand Modern use and symbolism alt=Capitoline she-wolf - Eden Park, Cincinnati - DSC03903.JPG Capitoline Wolf at Siena Duomo. According to a legend Siena was founded by Senius and Aschius, two sons of Remus. When they fled Rome, they took the statue of the She-wolf to Siena, which became the symbol of the town. The image was favoured by Benito Mussolini, who cast himself as the founder of a \\"New Rome\\" and donated copies of the statue to various places around the world. To encourage American goodwill, he sent several copies of the Capitoline Wolf to U.S. cities. In 1929 he sent one replica for a Sons of Italy national convention in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was switched for another one in 1931, which still stands in Eden Park, Cincinnati. Another replica was given to the city of Rome, Georgia, the same year. A third copy went to Rome, New York in 1956 by Alfonso Felici, a veteran of World War II. Another ended up at North-Eastern Normal University, China, where ancient Greek and Roman history is studied. The Capitoline Wolf was used on both the emblem and the poster for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The Roman football club A.S. Roma uses it in its emblem as well. It was used as the logo for Artie Ripp's record label Family Productions, which in 1971 released Billy Joel's first album as a solo artist, Cold Spring Harbor. Due to contractual obligations, it continued to appear on numerous Joel albums even after he was subsequently signed to Columbia Records. The programme of conservation undertaken in the 1990s resulted in an exhibition devoted to the Lupa Capitolina and her iconography.Capitoline Museums: Exhibition \\"The Capitoline She-Wolf\\", June‚ÄìOctober 2000 Anthony Mann's 1964 epic film The Fall of the Roman Empire prominently features an enlarged replica prop of the Capitoline Wolf as a republican symbol at the back of the Senate House, where, historically, the altar and statue of Victory would have stood.Allen M.

In the 2009 film Agora, set in 5th-century Alexandria, the Capitoline Wolf‚Äîcomplete with the del Pollaiolo twins‚Äîcan be seen in the prefect's palace. This is visible in the scene before Hypatia's capture, directly behind her character. In Rick Riordan's The Son of Neptune, Lupa is the wolf that trains all demigods who wish to enter Camp Jupiter. She trains Percy Jackson and is mentioned that she trained Jason Grace also. In the first episode of the American television programme The Addams Family, a mirror-image sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf is on display in the Addams's living room. It can be seen standing atop a table, just to the right of the main staircase. The Boston Latin School uses an image on the cover of their agenda book as well as being the official school emblem. The Capitoline Wolf is used in Romania and Moldova as a symbol of the Latin origin of its inhabitants and in some major cities there are replicas of the original statue given as a gift from Italy at the beginning of the 20th century. The Capitoline Wolf is reimagined in Look at Me (new Capitoline Wolf), a 2011 installation by Polish artist Pawe≈Ç Wocial.

He also won the European amateur championships in 1989 and 1991 at bantamweight, and in 1993 at featherweight. Todorov represented Bulgaria at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games. In 1992 he lost in the quarter-finals to North Korean Li Gwang-Sik. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Todorov qualified to the semi-finals where he met the then 19-year-old American, Floyd Mayweather, Jr. Todorov won by a 10‚Äì9 margin, although many observers felt that Mayweather won the fight. The referee initially raised Mayweather's hand at the end of the fight. Todorov went on to the final where he lost to Somluck Kamsing from Thailand and settled for the silver medal.

As a solo artist he has released three albums, Yil Lull (1988), Tribal Journey (1996) and Nunga, Koori and a Murri Love (2005). He has worked with artists, No Fixed Address (1982‚Äì83), Shane Howard (1986‚Äì88, 1991) and Rebecca Barnard (1990). In 1988 Geia composed the track, \\"Yil Lull\\", which has been recorded by other artists, Paul Kelly, Archie Roach, Jimmy Barnes, and the Singers for the Red, Black and Gold, which included Howard, Kelly, Christine Anu, Ren√©e Geyer, and Tiddas.  Biography  Joe Geia was born in 1959 in Ingham, Queensland and grew up as a member of the Murri peoples. His father, Albert Geia, was a cane cutter and indigenous elder, who was one of the leaders of the Palm Island strike of 1957. As a result, Albert, and other leaders, were banned from the island. Geia is a composer, guitarist, singer and didgeridoo player and has been recognised as one of the most influential figures in the development of contemporary Indigenous music. In the late 1970s he was a member of a Kuku Yalanji dance troupe. He moved to Adelaide to attend the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music (CASM) at the University of Adelaide. While at CASM he joined the Aboriginal band, No Fixed Address, in 1982 providing vocals, percussion and didgeridoo.Australian Rock Database entries: * Joe Geia: ‚Äì * No Fixed Address (1982‚Äì83): ‚Äì * Shane Howard and Friends (1986‚Äì87), Shane Howard Band (1987‚Äì88, 1991): ‚Äì As a member of the group he was recorded on their studio album, From My Eyes (August 1982).McFarlane, 'No Fixed Address' entry.

In 1985 he disbanded Nya Nunga and relocated to Melbourne where he formed Prince Nayh and the Slaves of Sin with Peter Camm on guitar, Chris Coyne on saxophone, Barry Denik on bass guitar, Rob Dixon on keyboards, Steve Hewitt on trumpet, Des McKenna on drums (ex- Lavidia Sage), John Petros on guitar, and Koori Brother William on vocals. In the following year they toured South Australia and Northern Territory. During that year Geia joined Shane Howard and Friends on vocals and guitar alongside Shane Howard on lead vocals (ex-Goanna) and Howard's former bandmates, Marcia Howard (his sister) on backing vocals, Simon Curphy on guitar, Joe Imbrol on bass guitar and Dave Stewart on drums.McFarlane, 'Shane Howard' entry. Archived from the original on 23 August 2004. Retrieved 1 June 2018. Geia, Shane, Marcia and Curphy continued with the Shane Howard Band from 1987 to 1988. Also in 1987 Geia was appointed as a cultural officer for the Aboriginal Advancement League of Victoria where he would, \\"visit local schools to play didgeridoo, teach dance and demonstrate traditional cooking.\\" Geia was granted $90,000 by the Australia Council for the Arts to fund his first solo album, Yil Lull, which was released in 1988 (Australia's bicentennial year), on the Only Gammin' label. It achieved an unprecedented level of critical and commercial success for an Aboriginal performer. The Council also sponsored his six-month national Uncle Willie Tour of 1988.\\"State Library of Victoria: Joe Geia's Uncle Willie Tour picture\\" and reached a wide audience. The album was considered vitally important among Aboriginal people, and was well-timed to express a growing sense of pride in culture and identity, and hope for the political fight for land rights. Geia has been cited as an important influence by almost every Aboriginal musician to achieve prominence since that time. He has worked with many other Australian musicians including a long-term close relationship with ARIA award-winning Tasmanian band Wild Pumpkins at Midnight, who often appeared as his backing band in various combinations. In 1995 Geia toured Europe with members of Wild Pumpkins under the name Joe Geia and the Black Snake Orchestra. They performed in Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium. In 1996 he was a guest vocalist on the song \\"Pretty Valley,\\" based on the oral history of a massacre of tribal people in New South Wales. Produced by Tony Cohen, it featured on the Wild Pumpkins' album Sad Trees, released by Way Over There, 1996. Wild Pumpkins guitarist Nick Larkins has been a regular member of Geia's live band since 1995, and contributed to his most recent album. Geia released a second album, Tribal Journey, in 1996, through Larrikin/Festival records. He has also contributed songs to other projects and worked as a session musician for other bands. His third album Nunga, Koori and a Murri Love was released by Across The Borders, Melbourne, in December 2005.National Library of Australia: Nunga, Koori & a Murri love ‚Äì Joe Geia Produced by former bandmate, Shane Howard, the album was made with a cast of well-known Australian support musicians.

Stylistically Geia's songs fit the category of roots music and range from simple Pacific songs to reggae, rock and funk. The songs are written in Aboriginal language and English, and touch on universal themes as well as issues of Aboriginal Australia, although not in an overtly political way.

The Students Coalition Against War - SCAW - is a grassroots social movement dedicated to creating and fostering progressive social change. SCAW focuses on public education, non-violent activism, organizing, advocacy and above all, reform. We aim to address and propose solutions ‚Äì in a definitive and comprehensive manner ‚Äì to the major social, economic and political issues, which induce, promote and sustain contemporary war, in all its forms worldwide. Such forms of modern warfare include, but are in no way limited to: both inter/intra state war, violations of fundamental human rights as defined by the universal declaration of human rights, the various forms of non-democratic economic reform which invariably undermine social well being, and the numerous systems of domination, discrimination, and oppression such as racism, individualism, and imperialism. The various types of activities and activism employed by SCAW include: research and public education, media activism, civil disobedience, direct action, and other traditional as well as new and innovative forms of activism, advocacy, campaigning and protest. Although initiated as a student organization, SCAW is a free and open social movement; it is fully democratic, decentralized and non-hierarchical in its structure and decision-making. One of the central aspects of SCAW is to promote the unification of both goals and tactics, thereby using methods that reflect the values they seek to see applied on a global scale. SCAW seeks to: # Fund and publish research on contemporary issues surrounding war aimed at introducing students and members of the public to these issues, and encouraging them to find out more. # Host information events to the same end. # Attract new people to getting involved in advocacy and activism in their communities. # Broaden and strengthen connections between civil society groups operating in our communities with a mind to promote co-operation and mutual support. # Promote inclusion and visibility of women and minorities at peace events in our communities. # Effect real change in the policy of governments complicit in war around the world.Mission Statement History SCAW was first formed in 1999 in Edmonton, Alberta by a small group of socially conscious students at the University of Alberta. When one of the founding members moved to Victoria, British Columbia, SCAW was started in that city as well. SCAW Halifax began in late 2004 when a member of SCAW Edmonton moved to Halifax. SCAW Ottawa was founded independently of the other SCAWs in January 2005, with the merging of several smaller campus anti- war groups. All four SCAWs are currently very active in their communities and work all a wide variety of projects surrounding issues of war worldwide, be that armed conflict or ideological. SCAW Ottawa SCAW Ottawa was formed in early 2005 out of the demonstrations against George W. Bush's visit to Ottawa on November 30, 2004. SCAW was initially an alliance of Carleton University and University of Ottawa students. Groups that merged into SCAW included the smaller campus anti-war group Global Peace Coalition. Organizations that originally helped build SCAW included Opirg-Carleton, Opirg-Ottawa and the Carleton International Socialists. SCAW's first action was March 19, 2005 on the second anniversary of the Iraq War. SCAW rallied at the University of Ottawa and marched to the intersection of Rideau and Sussex and occupied the intersection with 130 students for thirty minutes before leaving to join the city-wide rally. At Carleton University on September 22, 2005, SCAW organized an information picket of a speech by Chief of the Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier for his aggressive promotion of Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan. The picket caught the university's organizers off-guard when SCAW members flooded the microphones during question time. The moderator cut the question period short. SCAW participated in the September 24, 2005 demonstration against the occupation of Iraq, gathering about 100 students in a feeder march to the main rally. SCAW organized a protest at the Prime Minister's residence on October 24, 2005 when Condoleezza Rice visited Prime Minister Paul Martin. 150 participated on short notice, at 6pm on a Monday. One member of SCAW was arrested during the protest. On the third anniversary of the Iraq War, SCAW organized a street occupation of Rideau and Sussex for over an hour. It involved over 200 people, including a converted ambulance which hot food was served from in the below-zero temperatures. SCAW handed out an Afghanistan pamphlet during the protest. This was its first publication. Most recently, on March 30, 2006, members of SCAW attended a speech by Michael Ignatieff. In orange jumpsuits and black bags over their heads, four members of SCAW stood up, turned their backs to Ignatieff and stood during his entire speech holding anti-war, anti-torture placards. In February 2008, a renewed SCAW at Carleton University began using a poster that read 'War Monger' accompanied with a picture of Stephen Harper. In a letter to the student newspaper, The Charlatan, a first-year student criticized the action, for which SCAW responded with a summary of their position against the war in Afghanistan.‚ÄúSCAW Knows What it Opposes,‚Äù The Charlatan (14 Feb 2008). http://www.charlatan.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=19787&Itemid;=180. Relationship with other peace groups SCAW has friendly relations with the local peace groups. In Ottawa this includes NOWAR-Paix and Rassemblement Outaouais Contre la Guerre (ROCG). SCAW in Ottawa is a member organization of the Canadian Peace Alliance. SCAW-Halifax has provided Ottawa's SCAW with some resources, including a banner and webspace. In Halifax local allies include NSPIRG, Halifax Peace Coalition, Haiti Action Halifax, No One Is Illegal Halifax, Palestinian Solidarity Society, Students' Taking Action in Chiapas, Uberculture, the Decolonization Collective and many more. Membership and Politics SCAW's membership is varied. In Ottawa organized groups within SCAW include Opirg-Carleton, Opirg-Ottawa, Carleton International Socialists, Students With A Collective Conscious and some members of the Carleton University Muslim Students' Association. SCAW has members at Algonquin College, Universit√© du Qu√©bec en Outaouais and two CEGEPs, but no organized presence beyond Carleton University and the University of Ottawa. Its email list has 185 subscribers and its meetings range from 10 to 30 in attendance, and occasionally involve translation in French and English. Its recent pamphlet on Afghanistan was done with help from members of the Canadian Peace Alliance and University of Toronto's Students for Peace in Iraq. SCAW opposes the occupation of Iraq, Afghanistan and Haiti, though Iraq and Afghanistan are generally more prominent in terms of activity. SCAW has also done work to help the War Resisters Support Campaign, especially in Ottawa, where SCAW-Carleton was part of a group of dozens of people who marched down Bank Street to show their support for the Campaign on January 26, 2008.\\"Carleton Students Rally with US War Resisters,\\" The Charlatan (31 Jan 2008). http://www.charlatan.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=19695&Itemid;=176.

Scabbard chape from the St Ninian's Isle Treasure Illustration of the Thorsberg chape showing the runic inscriptions on both sides Chape has had various meanings in English, but the predominant one is a protective fitting at the bottom of a scabbard or sheath for a sword or dagger (10 in the diagram).OED \\"Chape\\", 2. \\"Chape\\", 1, described as obselete, is \\"A plate of metal with which anything is covered, overlaid or ornamented.\\" Historic blade weapons often had leather scabbards with metal fittings at either end, sometimes decorated.Oakeshott, pp. 239‚Äì245; Kavar, pp. 265‚Äì271 These are generally either in some sort of U shape, protecting the edges only, or a pocket shape covering the sides of the scabbard as well. The reinforced end of a single-piece metal scabbard can also be called the chape. The scabbard chape is not to be confused with the chappe, a French term - rain- guard in English - on the sword itself, a fitting at the top of the blade in late medieval weapons, just below the crossguard of the hilt. The chappe fitted outside the scabbard, presumably helping to hold the sword snugly and preventing rain coming in (4 in the diagram). This would typically have been of leather, though everything about these is uncertain as no original examples have survived, and they are mainly known from art. Etymology The word derives from the Latin \\"cappa\\", meaning hood or cape,OED \\"Chape\\" or tip or head. Archaeology With the \\"locket\\" or \\"throat\\" fitting at the top, open, end of the scabbard (9 in the diagram; confusingly, in French this is a chappe), the chape is often the only part of a scabbard to survive in the ground for archaeologists to find. Notable scabbard chapes include the Germanic Thorsberg chape, with an inscription in runes, from about 200 AD.The inscription has been given the Rundata (Scandinavian Runic-text Data Base) inventory designation DR 7. A striking silver chape terminating in the heads of animals or monsters from the St Ninian's Isle Treasure is now in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. This might be Anglo-Saxon or Scottish or Pictish, and dates to about 800 AD.Webster, pp 144‚Äì145, though Youngs describes the same items as \\"Pictish\\". Perhaps the most interesting period for chapes is Celtic art, where a variety of shapes and ornament were used.Kavar, pp. 265‚Äì271  Buckle chape  A buckle chape; this is the plate on the right.

Biography Malko was born in Brailiv, Vinnytsia oblast, Ukraine. His father was Ukrainian, his mother Russian. In 1906 he completed his studies in history and philology at Saint Petersburg University. In 1909 he graduated from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where he had included Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov and Lyadov among his teachers. He published articles on music criticism in the Russian press and performed as a pianist and later a conductor. In 1909 he became a conductor at the Mariinsky Theatre and, six years later, the head conductor there. From 1909 he studied conducting in Munich under Felix Mottl. In 1918 he became the director of the conservatory in Vitebsk and from 1921 taught at the Moscow Conservatory. From 1921 to 1924 he shuttled between Vitebsk, Moscow, Kiev and Kharkiv, conducting in each of these cities. In 1925 he became a professor of the Leningrad Conservatory. He became conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra in 1926 and conducted the world premi√®re of the Symphony No. 1 by his pupil Dmitri Shostakovich that same year, and the premiere of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 2, dedicated to him, in 1927. Malko also conducted the premiere of Nikolai Myaskovsky's 5th Symphony. Myaskovsky's 9th Symphony was dedicated to Nikolai Malko. He was succeeded as director of the Leningrad Philharmonic by his pupil Aleksandr Gauk in 1928, and continued to teach at the Conservatory. In 1929, invited to appear in the West, he and his wife left the Soviet Union, and did not return for thirty years, until a U.S. State Department-sanctioned invitation from the Soviet Ministry of Culture brought him back to conduct in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. Once in the West, Malko lived in Vienna, Prague and in Copenhagen, where he helped establish the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra, with the title Permanent Guest Conductor. With the outbreak of World War II in 1940, Malko settled in the United States, where he also taught conducting. His thoughts on conducting technique were gathered together and published in a volume entitled, The Conductor and his Baton (1950); a handbook on conducting currently available in the United States (Elizabeth A. H. Green: The Modern Conductor, 1996) is explicitly based on the principles set forth in Malko's book. From 1942 to 1946, he was music director of the Grand Rapids Symphony in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which was a community orchestra at the time. Malko recorded extensively for EMI in Copenhagen and then with the Philharmonia, in London. In 1951 he premiered Vagn Holmboe's 7th Symphony with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra. From 1954 to 1956 he lived in Britain and was principal conductor of the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra. Immediately after that, he moved unexpectedly to Australia, to take up the post of Chief Conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra following the hurried departure of Sir Eugene Goossens. He remained in this position until his death in Sydney five years later. A 4-CD box set featuring Malko conducting Tchaikovsky Symphony No.2, Shostakovich Symphony No.1, Haydn Symphony No.83, Mussorgsky Prelude Khovanschina, Rimsky-Korsakov Tsar's Bride & Symphonic Suite 'Antar', Bruckner Symphony No. 7 and Kodaly Szekelyfono 'The Spinning Room' is available from Lyrita (REAM.2120). In 1952 Richard Itter, the founder of Lyrita, began to make domestic recordings of BBC transmissions using state-of-the-art disc and tape recorders. He documented his collection but rarely listened to it, thus preserving a pristine archive. The Lyrita Recorded Edition Trust began a transfer programme in 2014 with the intention to release the best and rarest of these recordings to the public. The Itter collection is predominantly of British music, but it also contains some unique international repertoire. This release is the first in a planned occasional series in which Lyrita will pay tribute to those musicians who made an important contribution to musical life in the UK.

He is the author of a memoir, Caged (1999), about the wartime experiences of his compatriots. Life Landau was born in Warsaw in 1920, into a wealthy Polish-Jewish family. Before World War II, he worked in the family furs business. After the German invasion of Poland Landau became a member of Polish Underground. He fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and was captured. Sent to extermination camp, Landau survived by jumping from the train. After the war, Landau left Poland through Czechoslovakia, Germany and France and finally emigrated to Australia with his wife Luba in 1947. He ran a clothing business there, before turning to real estate. He died in 1996. David J. Landau, Caged - A Story of Jewish Resistance In 1999, the Landau family published the first edition of his memoir, Caged, written in the memory of wartime colleagues and those who did not survive but promised themselves: ‚ÄòWhoever survives owes it to us to tell the story.‚Äô His writing was encouraged by others, and the work was completed just days before his passing. The second edition of Caged was published in 2000 by Pan Macmillan in Sydney, Australia. David J. Landau, National Library of Australia Some writers on the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, most notably Moshe Arens,Moshe Arens, Flags Over the Warsaw Ghetto (Gefen Books, Jerusalem: 2011) accept Landau's book uncritically and treat it as an entirely reliable and accurate account of the struggle waged by the Jewish Military Union (≈ªZW) (in whose ranks Landau claims to have fought). Historians, however, have raised questions about its credibility and dispute many of the author's claims.Dariusz Libionka & Laurence Weinbaum Bohaterowie, hochsztaplerzy, opisywacze Wok√≥≈Ç ≈ªydowskiego ZwiƒÖzku Wojskowego (Stowarzyszenie Centrum Bada≈Ñ nad Zag≈ÇadƒÖ ≈ªyd√≥w, Warsaw: 2011 In June 2005, in a letter to the editor of the Israel daily Haaretz,Letters to the Editor, Haaretz, 10 June 2005 Avraham Cykiert of Mulgrave, Australia claimed to have ghost written the book and said that Landau's daughter had \\"doctored\\" his manuscript.

This is a common species of lowlands and foothills up to altitude, where it inhabits forest canopy and edges, and the crowns of trees in tall second growth or semi-open areas. The nest is a deep cup of dead leaves and spiderwebs attached by the rim to branches high in a tree. The normal clutch is two brown-marked white eggs. The adult lesser greenlet is in length and weighs . It has olive-green upperparts and a pale grey head with a white eye ring. The underparts are white with a yellow tinge to the breast and some olive on the flanks. Young birds are duller and brown above, and have a buff tone to the sides of the head and the breast. There are two races. Nominate H. d. decurtatus which breeds from central Panama southwards has a green crown to the head, and grey-crowned H. d. minor occupies the northern part of the bird's range. The latter subspecies was formerly given species status as the Grey-crowned Greenlet (H. minor) but the two forms interbreed extensively in central Panama and are now considered to be conspecific. Lesser greenlets feed on spiders and insects gleaned from tree foliage, They also eat small fruits and seeds. They will join mixed-species feeding flocks, and often accompany gnatcatchers, warblers and honeycreepers. The lesser greenlet has a nasal ' call and the song is a whistled ', slower and more melodious than that of the yellow-green vireo.

Founded in 1760 with the title Practical Astronomy (and with the office of Observer in the University) the title was changed in 1893. History The first holder of the chair was famed Scottish astronomer Alexander Wilson, who put forward the theory that the entire universe rotated around its centre (which was later found to be true for galaxies but not the universe), and discovered that sunspots viewed near the edge of the Sun's visible disk appear depressed below the solar surface, a phenomenon still referred to as the Wilson effect. The Professor was not at this time required to teach. Wilson employed his second son, Patrick, as his assistant and intended successor in 1782, with the approval of the university but not of the Crown. The Crown relented in 1784 and Patrick was appointed to the chair. William Meikleham was then appointed to the chair in 1799, but resigned it in 1803 to become Professor of Natural Philosophy. He was succeeded by John Couper, previously Minister of Baldernock, who was succeeded in 1836 by John Nichol. Nichol led the Astronomical Institute of Glasgow in its initiative to erect an observatory on Horslethill in 1841, which later fell into difficulties due to Nichol's poor accounting. The observatory was taken over by the university in 1845. Nichol was noted for delivering inspiring lectures both to students and the general public, and also lectured for two years on Natural Philosophy when the Professor, William Meikleham, (his predecessor in the Astronomy Chair) was unwell, and when his students included the young Lord Kelvin. Nichol died in 1859 and was succeeded by Robert Grant, who in 1883 published a Catalogue of 6,415 Stars for the Epoch 1870. Grant died in 1892 and was succeeded by Ludwig Becker, a German scientist originally from Bonn, who had moved to Scotland in 1885 as director of the observatory at Dunecht in Aberdeenshire. Becker was popular with students and was thought at the time to have the best-attended astronomy classes in Britain. He retired in 1935. In 1937, William Smart was appointed to the chair, having previously been John Couch Adams Astronomer at the University of Cambridge. He wrote over twenty books and was President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1949 to 1951. He retired in 1959 and was succeeded by Peter Sweet, formerly Assistant Director of the University of London Observatory. Sweet oversaw expansion of the Astronomy Department and construction of a new observatory on the university's Garscube site. Upon Sweet's retirement in 1982, the Department of Astronomy was merged into the Department of Natural Philosophy, and John Campbell Brown was appointed to a new Chair of Astrophysics while the Regius Chair remained vacant. Brown was appointed Astronomer Royal for Scotland in 1995, and in 1996 was appointed to the revived Regius Chair of Astronomy. In 2010, the university marked the chair's 250th anniversary with a week of public lectures, an exhibition on inaugural holder Alexander Wilson in the Hunterian Museum., and by hosting the 2010 National Astronomy Meeting.

Pre-war development of Soviet mechanized forces In Soviet Russia, the so- called armored forces (–±—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–≤—ã–µ —Å–∏–ª—ã) preceded the Tank Corps. They consisted of the motorised armored units (–∞–≤—Ç–æ–±—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–æ—Ç—Ä—è–¥—ã) made of armored vehicles and armored trains. The country did not have its own tanks during the Civil War of 1918‚Äì1920. In January 1918, the Red Army established the Soviet of Armored Units (–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç –±—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–≤—ã—Ö —á–∞—Å—Ç–µ–π, or –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–±—Ä–æ–Ω—å), later renamed to Central Armored Directorate and then once again to Chief Armored Directorate (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ –±—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–≤–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ). In December 1920, the Red Army received its first light tanks, assembled at the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory. In 1928, it began the production of the MS-1 tanks (–ú–∞–ª—ã–π –°–æ–ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è -1, where M stands for \\"small\\" and S ‚Äì for \\"convoy\\"). In 1929, it established the Central Directorate for Mechanization and Motorization of the Workers‚Äô and Peasants‚Äô Red Army. Tanks became a part of the mechanised corps at this point. During this time, and based on the experience of the Civil War with its sweeping movements of horse-mobile formations, Soviet military theorists such as Vladimir Triandafillov and Konstantin Kalinovsky elaborated the principles of combat use of armored units, which envisioned a large-scale use of tanks in different situations in cooperation with various army units. In the mid-1930s, these ideas found their reflection in the so-called Deep Operation and deep combat theories. From the second half of the 1920s, tank warfare development took place at Kazan, where the German Reichswehr was allowed to participate. In 1930, the First Mechanised Brigade had its own tank regiment of 110 tanks. In 1932, the first Mechanised Corps had over 500 tanks, and it was probably the first armoured unit of operational significance anywhere in the world. That same year, the Red Army established the Military Academy of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the Workers‚Äô and Peasants‚Äô Red Army (which became the Malinovskiy Mechanised Force Academy and is today part of the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation). In 1931‚Äì1935, the Red Army adopted light, medium, and later heavy tanks of different types. By the beginning of the 1936, it had already had four mechanised corps, six separate mechanised brigades, six separate tank regiments, fifteen mechanised regiments within cavalry divisions and considerable number of tank battalions and companies. The creation of mechanised and tank units marked the dawn of a new branch of armed forces, which would be called armored forces. In 1937, the Central Directorate of Mechanisation and Motorisation was renamed to Directorate of Automated Armored Units (–ê–≤—Ç–æ–±—Ä–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ) and then to Chief Directorate of Automated Armored Units (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ –∞–≤—Ç–æ–±—Ä–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –ì–∞–±—Ç—É, GABTU). Soviet armored units gained some combat experience during the Battle of Lake Khasan (1938), Battle of Khalkhin Gol (1939) and Winter War with Finland (1939‚Äì1940). In August 1938, the four mechanised corps were converted into tank corps. Each was authorized 12,710 men, between 560 and 600 tanks, and 118 artillery pieces. The corps included two light tank brigades (equipped with BT and T-26 tanks), a motor rifle and machine gun brigade, and a communications battalion. The 5th Mechanized Corps became the 15th Tank Corps, the 7th Mechanized Corps became the 10th Tank Corps, the 11th Mechanized Corps became the 20th Tank Corps, and the 45th Mechanized Corps became the 25th Tank Corps. In the summer of 1939, all three brigades of the 20th Tank Corps were detached from the corps and sent into combat during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. The 15th and 25th Tank Corps fought in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. As a result of the Soviet assessment of the tank corps as being unwieldy and difficult to control, shown by repeated traffic jams caused by the tank corps in Poland, the Main Military Council ordered their disbandment on 21 November, replacing the tank corps with 15 motorized divisions, each with two motorized rifle regiments, an artillery regiment, and a tank regiment. The tank corps were not actually disbanded until January 1940, by which time the 10th Tank Corps had seen brief service in the Winter War in December 1939. Besides the operational armoured and mechanised formations, separate tank battalions within rifle divisions existed. These were meant to reinforce rifle units for the purpose of breaching enemy defenses. They had to act in cooperation with the infantry without breaking away from it and were called tanks for immediate infantry support (—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–∏ –Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∏ –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã). Eastern Front of World War II On 31 March 1942, orders were given for the reformation of the tank corps, as a result of the Soviet need for massed armored units so that the small tank brigades, which were now the basic armored formation, could be capable of decisive actions. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Tank Corps were to consist of a headquarters, two tank brigades, and a motor rifle brigade, authorized a total of 5,603 men with 20 KV heavy tanks, 40 T-34 medium tanks, and 40 T-60 or T-70 light tanks. The new tank corps lacked artillery, reconnaissance and engineer units, and rear support elements, although its component brigades included such formations. They were the equivalent of small Western armored divisions. The motor rifle brigade was a new unit type intended to retain captured positions and to neutralize enemy infantry and anti-tank weapons. It was determined that this was too weak, and a third tank brigade was added to increase the offensive power. The final organisation as published in 1944 included an additional heavy tank or heavy self-propelled gun regiment, plus a medium and a light self-propelled gun regiment. A total of 31 tank corps were formed during the war, with 12 of them earning the designation of a Guards Tank Corps. Due to the destruction of the 21st Tank Corps at the Second Battle of Kharkov and the use of some tank corps to form mechanised corps, no more than 24 of them actually saw combat. The tank corps were the basic building block of the Tank Armies (see List of Soviet armies#Tank Armies). Most tank corps were converted to Tank Divisions in 1945-6.

It ended the war in Berlin. As part of the occupation forces, it was assigned to the 1st Guards Tank Army (also 1st Guards Mechanised Army). In 1957, it was reorganized into a Heavy Tank Division and re-designated the 13th Heavy Tank Division. This lasted until 1965, when it was returned to its original 9th Tank Division designation.

It was \\"an oddball in the Soviet Army. 13th Tank Corps had been so shot up that most of its tank brigades were removed in September‚ÄìOctober 1942, and when Mechanised Brigades were substituted at the beginning of November, it should have been redesignated as a Mechanised Corps with a new number, as had happened to other tank corps in similar situations. Instead, the corps retained the number '13' and even the Soviet sources get confused on what to call it: a tank corps or a mechanised corps. It had the subordinate units of a mechanised corps when it went into battle in late November and December 1942. It fought as a mechanised corps with 57th, 51st and 2nd Guards Armies during December in the mobile battles against German Panzers south of Stalingrad, and in recognition of its actions there on 9 January 1943 the 13th Mechanised Corps was redesignated as the 4th Guards Mechanised Corps.\\"Sharp, Soviet Order of Battle, World War II, vol.

It has a population of 35,085. The region has fertile soil which along with the moderate climate allows the growing of high quality crops. Al Husn was known for its wine; now its main products are wheat and olive oil. Al Husn is registered in Jordanian government documents with the spelling 'Al Husun', and it is the administrative center of the Bani Obaid district. History Al Husun Orthodox Church Al Husn is one of the possible sites of Dion, a city dating from when the Romans occupied northern Jordan and the region. The Decapolis cities (a ten-city Greco-Roman federation, or league, created under Pompey about 64-63 BCE). According to Pliny the Elder, (CE 23-79) the cities included: Scythopolis (Bet She'an), Hippos (Susieh), Gadara (Umm Qais), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl), Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa (Jerash), Dion, Kanatha (Kanawat), Damascus, and Raphana (Abila). Al Husn has one of the oldest Orthodox churches in Jordan. It was originally built in the second century (CE), but destroyed in 1680 by the Ottoman army. A church was later rebuilt in 1886 by the local Christians. Traditionally, Al Husn has been home to a relatively large Christian community, including Melkites; Al Husn, along with Fuhais, still includes a high percentage of Christians. In 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers named as al-Husun, situated in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Atiyya, part of the Sanjak of Hawran. It had 24 households and 15 bachelors; all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products; including wheat, barley, summer crops/fruit trees, goats and bee-hives; in addition to occasional revenues. The total tax was 17,153 ak√ße. 1/4 of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 204 In 1806, a famous German traveler named Seetzen arrived in Husn and became a guest of Al Sheikh Abdalla Ghanma. He narrates in his book, which describes his travels in the east, that when he got to Al Husn Pond and asked about the town's sheikh, he was directed to Abdalla‚Äôs residence, where he stayed with him for two weeks. In 1812, the Swiss tourist and discoverer of Petra, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, arrived in Husn. He also became a guest of Sheikh Abdalla Ghanma for ten days. Both these early travelers wrote about their stay in Husn and about their host; the description is full of compliments, appreciation and respect. In 1838 Al Husn's inhabitants were predominantly Sunni Muslims and Greek Christians.Smith, in Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 164 In 1961 the population of Husn was 3,728 inhabitants,Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 13 of whom 2,030 were Christians.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, pp. 115‚Äì116 Sights Al Husn is notable for its Roman-era artificial hill, situated in the northern part of the town, referred to by locals as \\"Al- Taal\\". The Taal used to be the property of the Nusairat family; it was later taken over by the Jordanian government. Local legend says there are \\"castle ruins\\" or a Byzantine church within the tell which gave the town its name; \\"Husn\\" means \\"castle\\" in Arabic. The hill is approximately 200 meters high and 800 meters in diameter. Other sights include the Roman Pool.

It is situated about two kilometres to the south east from Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram City. The Attukal Bhagavathy Temple, one of the ancient temples of South India, is popularly described as Sabarimala of the Women, as women form the major portion of devotees. The Goddess in the temple of Attukal is worshipped as the Supreme Mother, creator of all living beings and the mighty preserver as well as destroyer of them all. The pilgrims from all over the country, who visit Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple and worship the Lord, do not consider their visits complete without a visit to the shrine of the supreme Mother Attukalamma. According to mythology, Attukal Bhagavathy is supposed to be the divinised form of Kannaki, the famous heroine of Chilappathikaaram, written by Ilanko Adikal, the Tamil Poet. The story goes that after the destruction of ancient city of Madurai, Kannaki left the city and reached Kerala via Kanyakumari and on the way to Kodungalloor took a sojourn at Attukal. Kannaki is supposed to be the incarnation of Parvathy, the consort of Paramasiva. The all powerful and benign Attukal Bhagavathy reigns eternally supreme at Attukal and nurses devotees as a mother does her children. Thousands of devotees from far and near flock to the Temple to bend before the Goddess with awe and reverence to prostrate and redress their affliction and agony. The Pongala Mahotsavam is the most important festival of Attukal Bhagavathy Temple. This festival at Aatukal has been entered into the Guinness book of world records as the largest congregation of women in the world. The offering of Pongala is a special temple practice prevalent in the southern part of Kerala and some parts of Tamil Nadu. It is a ten-day programme commencing on the Karthika star of the Malayalam month of Makaram- Kumbham (February‚ÄìMarch) and closing with the sacrificial offering known as Kuruthitharpanam at night. On the ninth day of the festival the world-famous Attukal Pongala Mahotsavam takes place. The entire area of about 5 kilometre radius around temple with premises of houses of people of all caste, creed and religion, open fields, roads, commercial institutions, premises of Government offices etc. emerges as a consecrated ground for observing Pongala rituals for more than 2.5 million women devotees assembling from different parts of Kerala and outside. The ceremony is mostly confined to women folk even though men can also observe the rituals.Man devotional at Attukal Pongala 2014. Asianet News. Retrieved 3 January 2018.

Hyoga is cold and calm by nature, which complements his abilities as a saint. He was the third of the five main protagonists to be introduced. In some English adaptations he was named Swan Hyoga. Creation and conception Character outline One of the main characters in the series, Hyoga appears calm, collected, and unemotional. Beneath the surface, however, he is passionate and devoted to his ideals. As a Saint born under the Cygnus constellation, Hyoga is able to control and manipulate ice and snow as he pleases, as he mastered the basis of the technique of the Saints of ice, stop the atoms of matter by the power of their Cosmo. Role in the series In the manga, Hyoga originally did not choose to participate in the Graude Foundation's Galaxian Wars until he received an order from Sanctuary to assassinate the other bronze saints. He originally accepted this due to his hatred for the Graude Foundation, being aware that Mitsumasa Kido was his father. As he became more familiar with his subjects, however, Hyoga grew indecisive about his mission. Once Silver saints began to target him along with the other bronze saints, however, he dropped his allegiance to Sanctuary. His rage towards Sanctuary boiled after his master Camus made an unexpected visit to Siberia to sent his mother's ship deep into the ocean's abyss. Hyoga competes with the same motivation as the other bronze saints‚Äîto win the Gold Cloth of Sagittarius. During the battle with Phoenix Ikki, his tender side was revealed, and he slowly began to display his true personality. In the Sanctuary arc, Hyoga became extremely close to Andromeda Shun after his comrade displayed an act of selflessness in attempt to revive his cosmos from death, constantly referring to how he owed Shun his life. In the Hades arc, Hyoga paired with Dragon Shiryu as the saints of Athena waged war against the Underworld. Hyoga protects Seiya and Shun from the judge Minos during the story and later faces the gods Thanatos and Hypnos in the Elysium. Across this battles, the Cygnus Cloth becomes a stronger God Cloth and lends his Cosmos to Athena to kill Hades. A sidestory is contained in vol.13 and it is titled Koori no Kuni no Natasha Hen (Chapter of Natasha, from the Land of Ice) where Hyoga meets soldiers known as Blue Soldiers and saves a woman frozen. Reception Critical reception to Hyoga has been mixed. Kensh≈ç Ono describes the character as \\"collected and unemotional\\". Jason Thompson of Anime News Network found Hyoga's fight against the Black Cygnus too violent for the demographic's standards, especially when the Black Saint removes on of his own eyes DVDTalk noted that while fans might look forward Hyoga and Shiryu's screentime in the anime, he felt the series was poorly written to the point he felt Bronze Saints' personalities change too often in the same ways as the villains. DVDVisionJapan similarly found Hyoga's first fight brutal due to how Hydra Saint punches multiple times in the face to point Hyoga's blood falls outside the arena and reaches Seiya's face. Chris Beveridge from AnimeOnDVD joked how one of the anime's episode titles, \\"Farewell Hyoga ‚Äì Rest In Peace\\", spoils Hyoga's possible death in the Sanctuary arc. His fight against Camus was noted to be most interesting from the DVD reviewed as Hyoga has to clash with his two masters. Nevertheless, he found Hyoga's episodes fun to watch. Hyoga's \\"Diamond Dust\\" technique was criticized by the FandomPost for being overused in battles to the point it appears the writer suffered writer's block. Despite this in \\"Blood, Biceps, and Beautiful Eyes: Cultural Representations of Masculinity in Masami Kurumada's Saint Seiya\\", author Lorna Piatti-Farnell notes that the masculinity Seiya, Shun, Hyoga and Shiryu bow to involves accomplishments of their goals of justice might not come as a surprise as the magazine Shonen Jump often has manga that involves this predicaments. IGN praised him as one of the most charismatic main characters of the series, stating that despite his calm demeanor Hyoga carries an Oedipus complex as a result of losing his mother when he was a child. Hyoga's role in other films and series have been the subject of discussion. In regards to the Netflix series, HobbyConsolas felt Hyoga's backstory was well written despite some issues with the narrative. While liking Legend of the Sanctuarys themes, the same site was surprised by the handling of Hyoga who appears driving a bike. In a review of Legend of Sanctuary, Screen praised the homage to Hyoga's techniques and noted the older fans glorified his battle with Camus.

National SEED Project, Wellesley Centers for Women, Wellesley College, 2013‚Äì2014. Web. 6 Oct. 2014. Nationalseedproject.org McIntosh and Emily Style co-directed the first 25 years of SEED.

Wellesley.edu She directs the Gender, Race, and Inclusive Education Project, which provides workshops on privilege systems, feelings of fraudulence, and diversifying workplaces, curricula, and teaching methods. McIntosh was featured in \\"Mirrors of Privilege: Making Whiteness Visible\\", a documentary film produced by World Trust, revealing \\"what is often required [of people] to move through the stages of denial, defensiveness, guilt, fear, and shame into making a solid commitment to ending racial injustice.\\" As a speaker, McIntosh has presented or co-presented at over 1,500 private and public institutions and organizations, including 26 campuses located in Asia.  Invisible knapsack  In her 1988 essay, \\"White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women‚Äôs Studies\\",McIntosh, Peggy. \\"White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women‚Äôs Studies\\" Wellesley: Center for Research on Women,\\" 1988. Working paper 189. Print. McIntosh describes her understanding of \\"white privilege\\" as unearned advantage based on race, which can be observed both systemically and individually, like all unearned privileges in society (such as those related to class, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or ability). After observing and investigating what she calls \\"unacknowledged male privilege\\" held unconsciously by men, McIntosh concluded that, since hierarchies in society are interlocking, she probably experienced a \\"white privilege\\" analogous to male privilege. McIntosh used the metaphor of white privilege as \\"an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, clothes, compass, emergency gear, and blank checks\\". In her original 1988 essay, McIntosh listed forty-six of her own everyday advantages, such as \\"I can go shopping most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed\\"; \\"I can be sure that my children will be given curricular materials that testify to the existence of their race\\"; and \\"If a traffic cop pulls me over or if the IRS audits my tax return, I can be sure I haven't been singled out because of my race.\\" Many of these observations set in a different country could lead to a different conclusion. The observation of ‚Äúthose of similar ethnicity in media‚Äù Is flawed when watching a TV channel in such a country as China. McIntosh has stated that in order to study systems of advantage and disadvantage as they impact individuals, \\"Whiteness is just one of the many variables that one can look at, starting with, for example, one's place in the birth order, or your body type, or your athletic abilities, or your relationship to written and spoken words, or your parents' places of origin, or your parents' relationship to education, to money, or to English, or what is projected onto your religious or ethnic background.\\" She believes that all people in the U.S. have combination of systemic, unearned advantages and disadvantages. She feels that it is not possible to do work against racism without doing work against white privilege, any more than it is possible to do work against sexism without doing work against male privilege. In 1989, the original \\"White Privilege and Male Privilege\\" essay was edited down and entitled \\"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\\".Peace and Freedom Magazine, July/August, 1989, pp. 10-12. https://nationalseedproject.org/white- privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack 16 March 2017 Both the long and short pieces showcase the white privilege McIntosh experiences on a daily basis; through an extensive list of examples McIntosh illustrates that white privilege is like an intangible gift of unearned entitlement, unearned advantage, and unearned dominance. Privilege gives white people easier access to political and societal benefits that people of color are denied. This work has been included in many K-12 and higher education course materials, and has been cited as an influence for later social justice commentators.Solomona, R. P., Portelli, J. P., Daniel, B.

St Paul, Minnesota. 2009  SEED Project  McIntosh founded the National SEED Project on Inclusive Curriculum (\\"Seeking Educational Equity & Diversity\\") in 1986. Emily Style, as founding co-director, partnered with McIntosh for the SEED Project's first twenty-five years. From 2001 until 2011, Brenda Flyswithhawks joined them as the third co-director. SEED has become the largest peer-led faculty development project for educators in the US. McIntosh believed that teachers were capable of being the leaders of their own adult development with regard to teaching equitably and inclusively. Monthly peer-led SEED seminars are designed as round-table testimonies about teachers' past and present experiences in life and in schooling. Seminar members, including parents and community members, become more aware of their experiences of systemic oppression associated with their gender, race, class, and sexual orientation, inside and outside of the structures of schooling. The SEED discussions help teachers to develop ways of implementing gender-fair and globally-informed curricula for their students. Since the first SEED Project meeting in 1987, SEED has trained 2,200 K-16 teachers in 40 US states and 14 other countries, indirectly impacting millions of students. The SEED Project has been funded by private donors, local school support, and 15 foundations, including the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. In 2011, McIntosh stepped down as the project's co- director.

It was founded in 1890, in Bremen, Germany, by August K√ºhne and Friedrich Nagel. It provides sea freight and airfreight forwarding, contract logistics, and overland businesses. In 2010, Kuehne + Nagel was the leading global freight forwarder, accounting for nearly 15% of the world's air and sea freight business by revenue, ahead of DHL Global Forwarding, DB Schenker Logistics, and Panalpina. As of 2017, it has more than 1,336 offices in 109 countries, with around 82,000 employees. History =Early years and evolution: 1890 - 1950s= The origins of Kuehne + Nagel was in 1890, when August K√ºhne and Friedrich Nagel founded a forwarding commission agency in Bremen, Germany. It initially used to concentrate on cotton and consolidated freight. Later in 1902, it expanded its operations to the German seaport city of Hamburg. In 1907, the co-founder Friedrich Nagel died, and August K√ºhne took over his shares in the company. The legacy of Nagel still lives on, in the company's name - Kuehne + Nagel (KN). The First World War greatly affected its businesses. Upon K√ºhne's death in 1932, his sons - Alfred and Werner - became partners in the firm. https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Maass Adolf Maass] (1875 - probably early in 1945 in Auschwitz labour camp), who was Jewish, a partner, and one of the firm's shareholder with a 45% stake, was forced out in April 1933. On the 1st of May 1933 Alfred and Werner K√ºhne joined the Nazi Party,Hamburg State Archives Signatur 371-8 II_SXXI A15 a 133 and under the brothers' management the firm played a prominent role in the transport of property seized from Jews in occupied territories. =Transition to a Swiss holding co., and expansion: 1950s - 1990s= In the early 1950s, Alfred K√ºhne initiated the company's international expansion; and KN expanded its operations into Canada, with the opening of branch offices in Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec. In 1963, KN took a controlling stake in Athens based Proodos S.A, and also expanded into Italy. In 1975, the company adopted a holding company structure, with the formation of Kuehne + Nagel International AG based in Schindellegi, Switzerland, as the ultimate holding company. In the mid-1960s, a third- generation member of the K√ºhne family, Klaus-Michael K√ºhne joined his father Alfred K√ºhne as a junior partner, having completed an apprenticeship in banking. In 1966, at the age of 30, he joined the management team as executive chairman; and spearheaded KN's future expansion, particularly its European and the Far Eastern operations. In 1981, Alfred K√ºhne died; and in July the same year, due to the losses sustained by the K√ºhne family in attempting to expand its shipping fleet, a 50% stake in KN was sold to the British conglomerate Lonrho Plc for 90 million DM. Following the purchase, Klaus-Michael K√ºhne and Lonrho's head, Roland \\"Tiny\\" Rowland acted as joint chief executives of the combined organisation. KN further expanded with its acquisition of freight companies: Domenichelli SpA (Italy), Van Vliet BV (Netherlands), Hollis Transport Group Ltd. (UK), Transportes Tres (Spain), and other acquisitions in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. =Further expansion: 1990s - present= The 1990 German reunification was an important event for many German companies, including KN; and provided them the necessary impetus to expand further. After the reunification, KN integrated its network in the former German Democratic Republic, and consolidated its operations. In 1992, it bought back Lonrho plc's 50% stake in the company; and went public in May 1994. It was listed on the Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges, which provided a platform for further exchange-based acquisitions. The same year, KN established a Russian subsidiary; and pushed ahead into Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. In the mid 1990s, strategic focus given to expand the lucrative logistics-related contracts / operations paid off - one being with DuPont in which KN would operate the chemical giant's leveraged distribution activities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In July 1999, K√ºhne handed over the post of CEO to Klaus Herms, and continued as the executive chairman and president of the board. In the early 2000s, KN got a foothold in the Asia Pacific contract logistics market, when it forged a strategic alliance with Singapore-based SembCorp Logistics. In 2001, it acquired USCO Logistics Inc. - a warehouse- based logistics service provider based in Hamden, Connecticut, for US$300 million. KN and SembCorp chose to follow different strategic paths in 2004, and ended their strategic partnership. In October 2007, the board of KN appointed Reinhard Lange as the successor to CEO Klaus Herms, effective June 2009 to ensure a smooth handover. The succession plan was similar to the SAP's 2007 CEO transition plan from Henning Kagermann to L√©o Apotheker, which received praise in the media. In 2012, Kuehne + Nagel acquired the business contracts of Canada's Perishables International Transportation (PIT) to expand into global fresh and frozen foods network. In September 2013, Kuehne + Nagel agreed to merge its railfreight business with VTG to form VTG Rail Logistics, which would be Europe's largest private railfreight business when it starts operations in 2014. In April 2014, Kuehne + Nagel International was fined $3.1 million for its part in a freight forwarding cartel case brought by the Commerce Commission. Kuehne + Nagel was the last defendant in the seven-year investigation involving six firms, who referred to themselves as the \\"Gardening Club\\" and used horticultural code to discuss anti-competitive practices among them. The regulator's investigation uncovered emails that referred to agreed surcharges as \\"the new price for asparagus for the forthcoming season\\" or \\"the price of marrows\\". In June 2020 the 2021 Rugby League World Cup announced that Kuehne + Nagel would become the official Logistics Partner of the tournament, providing logistics services, including requirements for all of the 61 matches across the men‚Äôs, women‚Äôs and wheelchair tournaments, all 32 participating teams, and the fulfilment of warehousing and storage needs.https://www.rlwc2021.com/article/224/kuehne+nagel-to-deliver- rlwc2021-as-official-partner Organization The group employs approximately 83,000 people in 1000 locations in more than 100 countries and has approximately 12 million sqm of warehouse space under management. It is organised in the following five geographical divisions: * Europe (based in Hamburg, Germany) * Middle East and Africa (based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates) * North America (based in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States) * Central & South America (based in Santiago de Chile, Chile) * North Asia Pacific (based in Shanghai, China) * South Asia Pacific (based in Singapore,Sri Lanka) Operations It is divided into the following operating segments: * Seafreight * Airfreight * Overland * Contract Logistics Services and solutions It provides sea freight and airfreight forwarding, contract logistics and overland businesses; with a focus on providing IT-based logistics solutions.

It is located dorsally at the base of the tail (between the fourth caudal vertebra and the pygostyle) and is greatly variable in both shape and size. In some species, the opening of the gland has a small tuft of feathers to provide a wick for the preen oil (see below). It is a holocrine gland enclosed in a connective tissue capsule made up of glandular acini that deposit their oil secretion into a common collector tube ending in a variable number of pores (openings), most usually two. Each lobe has a central cavity that collects the secretion from tubules arranged radially around the cavity. The gland secretion is conveyed to the surface via ducts that, in most species, open at the top of a papilla (nipple-like structure). Etymology From uropygium: Mediaeval Latin, from Ancient Greek Œø·ΩêœÅŒøœÄœçŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ (ouropugion), from Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨ (oura) \\"tail\\" and œÄœÖŒ≥ŒÆ (puge) \\"rump\\". Distribution amongst species The gland is invariably present at embryonic stages, whereas it can be vestigial in adults of certain orders, families, genera and species. Some or all species in at least nine families of birds lack a uropygial gland, mostly the ones unable to fly or the ones that produce powder down for feather maintenance. These include kiwis (Apterygidae), emu (Dromaiidae), ostriches (Struthionidae), rheas (Rheidae), cassowaries (Casuariidae), mesites (Mesitornithidae), bustards (Otididae), pigeons and doves (Columbidae), amazon parrots (Psittacidae), frogmouths (Podargidae), and woodpeckers (Picidae). These birds typically find other means to stay clean and dry, such as taking a dust bath. Researchers have been unable to correlate the presence or absence of the uropygial gland with factors such as distribution, climate, ecology, or flightlessness. Gland secretion European herring gull (Larus argentatus): The bird on the right is uncovering its uropygial gland to distribute the gland's oil through the plumage by means of preening. The bird on the left is pushing its head towards its uropygial gland. White-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera) extracting preen oil from its uropygial gland. The uropygial gland secretes an oil (preen oil) through the dorsal surface of the skin via a grease nipple-like nub or papilla. The oil contains a complex and variable mixture of substances formed greatly of aliphatic monoester waxes, formed of fatty acids and monohydroxy wax-alcohols. However, some types of diester waxes called uropygiols and containing hydroxyfatty acids and/or alkane-diols exist in the secretions of the uropygial gland of some groups of birds. Preen gland secretion of some, but not all, birds have shown to be antimicrobial. Some birds harbor bacteria in their preen gland, which to date, have (exclusively) been isolated from preen glands (e.g. Enterococcus phoeniculicola and Corynebacterium uropygiale). Some of those bacteria add to the antimicrobial properties of preen wax. A bird will typically transfer preen oil to its body during preening by rubbing its beak and head against the gland opening and then rubbing the accumulated oil on the feathers of the body and wings, and on the skin of the feet and legs. Tailward areas are usually preened utilizing the beak, although some species, such as budgerigars, use the feet to apply the oil to feathers around the vent. History Emperor Frederick II, in his thirteenth-century treatise on falconry, was seemingly the first to discuss the function of the uropygial gland of birds. He believed that its product not only oiled the plumage but also provided a poison which was introduced by the claws of hawks and owls thus bringing quicker death to their prey. However, studies in 1678 on the question of the toxic nature of the uropygial gland secretion found no evidence to support Frederick's contention. Function Several researchers have reported differences in the relative gland weights attributing them to factors like seasonal changes, habitat, body weight, inter-individual variations, and sex. Significant differences are found in the relative gland size between males and females in most species, however, no coherent explanation has as yet been found for these results. Many ornithologists believe the function of the uropygial gland differs among various species of birds. =Feather and body integrity= Preen oil is believed to help maintain the integrity of feathers. In waterbirds, preen oil maintains the flexibility of feathers and keeps feather barbules from breaking. The interlocking barbules, when in good condition, form a barrier that helps repel water (see below). In some species, preen oil is also believed to maintain the integrity of the horny beak and the scaly skin of the legs and feet. It has also been speculated that in some species, preen oil contains a precursor of vitamin D; this precursor is converted to vitamin D by the action of sunlight and then absorbed through the skin. =Courtship and pheromone production= Some researchers have postulated that the change in preen oil viscosity may be related to the formation of the more brilliant plumage required for courtship, although later research did not find support for this idea. The results of other studies suggest that the gland in females may be involved in the production and secretion of lipids with female pheromone activity. =Waterproofing effect= The uropygial gland is strongly developed in many waterbirds, such as ducks, petrels, pelicans and in the osprey and the oilbird. A study examining the gland's mass relative to body weight in 126 bird species showed the absence of a clear-cut correlation between the gland's mass and the degree of birds' contact with water. Anecdotal reports indicating that the waterproofing effect of the hydrophobic uropygiols might be increased by electrostatic charge to the oiled feather through the mechanical action of preening are not supported by scientific studies. =Antiparasitic effect= Hoopoes host symbiotic bacteria in their uropygial glands whose excretions act against feather-degrading bacteria. The taxonomic richness of avian louse burdens covaries positively with uropygial gland size (relative to body size) across avian taxa, suggesting coevolution between gland size and parasite biodiversity. The hoopoe (Upupa epops) uropygial gland harbours symbiotic bacteria whose excretions reduce the activity of feather-degrading bacteria and thus help to preserve the plumage. In vitro studies suggest that the preen oils of rock doves (Columba livia) are effective against lice, however in vivo studies which removed the preen gland from captive birds had no significant effect on louse loads over the course of four months (but did reduce plumage quality), suggesting that preen oil may not be an important defense against lice in this species. Similarly, there was no evidence to support a role of the gland secretion in attracting biting midges and black flies in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and feral pigeons (Columba livia). =Cosmetic effect= Secretions of the uropygial gland of greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) contain carotenoids, organic pigments which give flamingos their pink colour. During the breeding season, greater flamingos increase the frequency of their spreading uropygial secretions over their feathers and thereby enhance their colour. This cosmetic use of uropygial secretions has been described as applying \\"make-up\\". =The chemical composition= The biochemical composition of preen oil has been reported to significantly vary among birds in several ways, for example, the qualitative and quantitative content of the volatile compounds, chain length of diols, lipid concentration, ester saturation, type of fatty acids and their percentage composition. This variation is due to a range of factors, including species, age, sex and season. In chickens, a limited number of studies have investigated the specific effect of diet on the fatty acid composition of preen oil in meat chickens. The preen oil of meat chickens is dominated by saturated fatty acids, which make up to 97% of the total fatty acids, with 13 different medium to long chain saturated fatty acids (C8:0 to C22:0) detected. The preen oil contained several odd-chain fatty acids, which suggests they may be derived from lipolysis by the uropygial gland and/or its microbiome. Diet and gender had small but significant effects on levels of specific saturated fatty acid in the preen oil. The fatty acid composition of the preen oil did not reflect the more diverse fatty acid compositions of the diet or whole blood. Therefore, this clearly indicate that measuring the fatty acid profile of preen oil is not a suitable alternative approach for predicting the fatty acid composition of the blood of meat chickens.

Overview One of the most positive ways of consolidating the consumer as the most important focus of the organisation is to look on this relationship as a prime asset of the business; one that has been built up by a series of marketing investments over the years. As with any other asset, this investment can be expected to bring returns over subsequent years. On the other hand, also like any other asset, it has to be protected and husbanded. This 'asset' is often referred to as the customer franchise. At one extreme it may come from the individual relationship developed face to face by the sales professional. At the other it is the cumulative image, held by the consumer, resulting from long exposure to all aspects of the product or service, and especially to a number of advertising and promotional campaigns. In some markets the customer franchise may be so strong as to be exclusive; in effect giving the supplier a monopoly with those customers. Even though, Andrew Ehrenberg's work on brand portfolios has shown that consumers may regularly switch brands ‚Äì for variety ‚Äì they may still retain an image of the brand; which will swing the balance when their next purchase decision is taken. It may thus still have a value (upon which the advertiser can build) even if the current purchasing decision goes against it. A later decision may, once again, swing in its favour. Even though it is intangible, the customer franchise is an asset in terms of its potential effect on sales. Cumulative impact It is based, though, on an accumulation of impacts over time. Unfortunately, too many marketers ‚Äì particularly those in creative departments within advertising agencies ‚Äì signally fail to recognise the importance, and long-term nature, of this investment. They treat each new campaign as if it could, and should, be taken in isolation - no matter how it meshes with previous messages which have been delivered to the consumer. The evidence is that the consumer, on the other hand, does not view the advertising and promotion in such lofty isolation; instead he or she incorporates it into their existing image - to good or bad effect, depending upon how well the new campaign complements the old. Brand franchise The customer franchise is, to all practical intents, the external alter ego of the brand, and hence can be seen as the mirror image of the brand franchise. The brand is how the producer typically sees the (internal) investment. The customer franchise is the outcome of that internal investment; the counterbalancing entry with the customers.

Formed in 1999, they have recorded and released a total of six full-length studio albums which were highly successful in Germany and also saw some success in other European countries. They have been on an indefinite hiatus since 2012. History =The 1990s: Forming and first contract= In 1997, Rea Garvey left his band The Reckless Pedestrians and home town of Tralee, Ireland to go to Germany with not a lot of money and a demo CD in his pocket. He put an ad into local paper Stockacher Anzeiger stating, \\"Singer requires band for recording and live shows\\". Mike Gommeringer (Gomezz) saw this ad and accurately assumed it must have been Garvey, whose original band he had once seen play live. The two met up and subsequently recruited Uwe, Sebi and Phil. Their first gig was played on New Year's Eve 1998 in Stockach. Reamonn is an Irish form of the name Raymond. In order to secure a recording contract, they set up a showcase at Logo, a small club in Hamburg, in front of 16 representatives from various record labels in 1999. The band was quickly offered several contracts, settling on signing with Virgin Records Germany. In 2006, they switched to Universal Music. =The 2000s: Breakthrough with Supergirl= Reamonn's first chart success came with \\"Supergirl,\\" a track that received heavy airplay on mainstream radio stations in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. Taken from the album \\"Tuesday,\\" it reached the top 10 in 2000 in each of those countries. The track \\"Alright\\" is perhaps one of the signature songs from Reamonn's early period. Performing at the Roxy in Hollywood, California, to impress record executives, the band played the song twice. Alas, the crowd was sparse, as most of the action was at the Viper Room to catch then-hot British talent Jem. Reamonn never got the U.S. deal, however, back in Europe, their popularity continued to soar with a mix of radio-friendly sounds. To date, their most successful \\"international\\" single is \\"Tonight\\" from the album \\"Wish\\". Released in summer 2006, the track hit No. 1 in Romania, but did not crack the top 10 in Germany. The track also opened Reamonn up to new markets, such as Greece and Portugal, where the band continues to receive airplay. On 7 July 2007 the band performed at the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg's HSH Nordbank Arena. The same year, Garvey provided vocals for trance DJ Paul van Dyk's song \\"Let Go\\". On 24 July 2008 the group was chosen as the opening act for Barack Obama's speech at The Siegess√§ule in Berlin, before an estimated crowd of 200,000. The band made the then United States Senator an honorary Reamonn member, presenting him with a band ring.BILD.de On 20 December 2008 Reamonn played their song \\"Faith\\" as an entrance theme for boxer Nikolai Valuev leading up to his WBA championship fight versus Evander Holyfield in Z√ºrich. \\"Faith\\" was also the official song of the 2009 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season. In November 2009, Reamonn went on a world tour with Status Quo as a support band. = The 2010s: Breakup and new projects = On 27 August 2010 Reamonn released their Best Of album \\"Eleven\\", which features three new tracks: the new singles \\"Yesterday\\", \\"Colder\\" and \\"Let The Morning Sleep\\". Each of the album's two disks features 11 songs taken from every album Reamonn have recorded. The Deluxe Edition features a DVD with all the videos and some live tracks. In December 2010, Reamonn released their DVD \\"Eleven: Live At The Casino\\". Later on, the members decided to concentrate on other musical projects. Rea Garvey's first solo single is called \\"Can't Stand the Silence\\" and was released on 9 September 2011. The album of the same name was released on 30 September 2011. Later, \\"Can't Stand the Silence: The Encore Edition\\" was released, featuring a few new songs including the single \\"Wild Love\\". The tour in support of the album consisted of dates in Germany during 2011 and 2012, and continued on in 2013 with new dates also outside Germany: in Switzerland, France, Ireland, the UK, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. For the 2013 dates, Ryan Sheridan was the support act. Rea Garvey released his second solo album called \\"Pride\\" in May 2014. The album features the single \\"Can't Say No\\". In September 2014, Rea Garvey released the \\"Oh My Love\\" EP, which features the original song and a new version with Amy Macdonald. Rea Garvey is also a member of the jury for The Voice of Germany. The other members of Reamonn teamed up with Thomas Hanreich, the former frontman of Vivid, to form the band Stereolove. They released their first album \\"Stereo Loves You\\" in September 2012 and their second album \\"Boy A\\" in 2015.

As general counsel of the NAACP, Jones fought to end school segregation, including in the northern United States. From 1979 until 1995, he served as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit before assuming senior status, and in 2002 retired to resume a private legal practice.  Early years  Jones was born in the Smoky Hollow district of Youngstown, Ohio, several blocks from a federal courthouse that now bears his name. Although he lived in an integrated neighborhood and attended an integrated public high school, his mother took him to the local segregated YMCA, where he heard and met national civil rights leaders. She also introduced him to J. Maynard Dickerson, a lawyer as well as publisher of the weekly black newspaper, The Buckeye Review, who became his mentor. Jones became active in the local NAACP's youth council and successfully organized a boycott of the local roller skating rink, which previously only allowed blacks to skate only on Monday nights. He graduated high school in 1945 and was inducted in the U.S. Army since World War II had not yet ended. He later recalled his shock at the segregated training facility at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, and those Italian prisoners of war received better treatment than black soldiers. Nonetheless, Jones served with the United States Army Air Corps After the war, using the GI Bill, Jones entered Youngstown College (now Youngstown State University). There, he continued active with the NAACP, and when nearby Warren, Ohio tried to bar blacks from the local swimming pool, he saw future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall in action. After receiving his Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1951, he enrolled in law school, studying at nights while serving as director of Youngstown's Fair Employment Practices Commission. He graduated in 1956, receiving a Bachelor of Laws degree.  Legal career  Jones was admitted to the bar in 1957, setting up his own private practice. In 1961, Attorney General Robert Kennedy nominated him as Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio in Cleveland. Thus in 1962, he became the first African American to serve in that position in the district. He held that position until his 1967 appointment as Assistant General Counsel to President Lyndon B. Johnson's National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the Kerner Commission). Following his term with the Kerner Commission, Jones returned to private practice with the firm of Goldberg & Jones in Youngstown. In 1969, he was asked to serve as general counsel of the NAACP by executive director Roy Wilkins. The following year, Jones was honored by more than 600 dignitaries at an NAACP recognition banquet held in Youngstown. In a keynote address, he described the situation of African Americans in the following terms: \\"We still live in the basement of the great society. We must keep plodding until we get what we are striving for\\". For the next nine years, Jones directed all NAACP litigation. In addition to personally arguing several cases in the United States Supreme Court, he coordinated national efforts to end northern school segregation, to defend affirmative action, and to inquire into discrimination against black servicemen in the United States military. He also successfully coordinated the NAACP's defense on First Amendment grounds in the Mississippi Boycott case.University of Cincinnati College of Law ‚ÄúThe Papers of Judge Nathaniel R. Jones/Biographical Sketch, 1995 accessed June 23, 2017 However, he was also the losing attorney in Milliken v. Bradley, which restricted urban/suburban desegregation efforts.and Reed v. Rhodes, concerning desegregation of Cleveland-area schools.  Judicial career and beyond  President Jimmy Carter on August 28, 1979 nominated Jones, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge John Weld Peck II. The United States Senate confirmed his nomination on October 4, 1979, and he received his commission the next day. He took his judicial oath on October 15, 1979. He assumed senior status on May 13, 1995. His service terminated on March 30, 2002, when he retired. While on the federal bench, in addition to hearing cases, Judge Jones taught at Harvard Law School and at the University of Cincinnati College of Law. He also made many trips to South Africa. He spoke against the legal underpinnings of apartheid, became one of the observers for the first democratic elections in 1993, and later consulted with drafters of the South African constitution.Youngstown State University Alumni News Briefs, July 22, 2016; accessed June 23, 2017. After his retirement, Jones became a Senior Counsel in the Cincinnati office of Blank Rome LLP, also serving as its Chief Diversity and Inclusion officer. He also wrote a memoir, Answering the Call: An Autobiography of the Modern Struggle to End Racial Discrimination in America (2016), with a foreword by Harvard professor Evelyn Brooks Higgenbotham. On May 6, 2003, the second federal courthouse established in his hometown of Youngstown, Ohio was named in honor of Jones. Former U.S. Representative Louis B. Stokes of Cleveland was on hand for the naming ceremony. \\"This building, which will forever carry your name, will be a testament to outstanding public service by a local boy made good\\", Stokes said. Jones received the NAACP's Spingarn Medal in 2016, its highest honor. The University of Cincinnati named its Center for Race, Gender, and Social Justice to honor Judge Jones in 2019. He also received 19 honorary degrees.  Personal life  Jones was married to the late Lillian Graham Jones (n√©e Hawthorne) and had five children: Stephanie J. Jones, William L. Hawthorne, Ricky B. Hawthorne, Marc D. Hawthorne, and Pamela L. Velez. Jones was a Prince Hall Freemason and a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

The United Gold Coast Convention appointed its leaders to include Kwame Nkrumah, who was the Secretary General. However, upon an aligation for plans against Nkrumah's leadership, he was arrested and jailed. The UGCC leadership broke up and Kwame Nkrumah went on a separate way to set up the Convention People's Party (CPP) for the purpose of self-governance. History In the 1940s, African merchants, such as George Alfred Grant (\\"Paa Grant\\"), were ready to finance the organization of a political movement to assure their commercial interests in the face of unfair colonial practices. The party was founded by J. B. Danquah on 4 August 1947 by a combination of chiefs, academics and lawyers,Birmingham, David, Kwame Nkrumah: The Father of African Nationalism (revised edition), Ohio University Press, 1998, p. 13. including R.

On 10 December 1947, Kwame Nkrumah returned to the (British colony) accepting Danquah's invitation to become the UGCC General Secretary. Big Six member Ebenezer Ako-Adjei recommended inviting Nkrumah, whom he had met at Lincoln University. Nkrumah was offered a salary of ¬£250, and Paa Grant paid the boat fare from Liverpool to Ghana.Birmingham, David, Kwame Nkrumah: The Father of African Nationalism (revised edition), Ohio University Press, 1998. Danquah and Nkrumah subsequently disagreed over the direction of the independence movement and parted ways after two years. Nkrumah went on to form the Convention People's Party and eventually became the first president of independent Ghana. There was a meeting between Nkrumah and members of the party which occurred in Saltpond, a town in Central region. It was said Nkrumah rejected a proposal for the promotion of fundamental human rights. The UGCC performed poorly in the 1951 elections, winning only three seats.

He was one of the most famous musicians of his time. Life Claude Balbastre was born in Dijon in 1724. Although his exact birthdate has been disputed, the discovery of his baptismal record has now made that date, December 8, certain.Baptismal record of Claude Balbastre Balbastre's father, B√©nigne, a church organist in Dijon, had 18 children from two marriages; Claude was the 16th. Three of his brothers were also named Claude. He received his first music lessons from his father, then became a pupil of Claude Rameau, the younger brother of Jean-Philippe Rameau, the most famous French musician at the time and also a native of Dijon. Balbastre settled in Paris in 1750 and studied there with Pierre F√©vrier, whom he succeeded as organist of the Saint Roch church. Jean-Philippe Rameau helped and protected Balbastre when he settled in the city, so Balbastre was quickly and efficiently introduced to the Parisian musical circles and high society, and made a brilliant career: he played at the Concert Spirituel until 1782,Sadie, S.(ed), The Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopaedia of Music, Norton, 1994, p.54 became organist of the Notre-Dame cathedral and of the Chapelle Royale, became harpsichordist to the French royal court where he taught queen Marie-Antoinette, and became organist for Louis-Stanislas-Xavier, Count of Provence, who later became Louis XVIII, King of France. Balbastre's fame was so great that the Archbishop of Paris, Christophe de Beaumont had to forbid him to play at Saint Roch during some of the services, because the churches were always crowded when Balbastre played. An account of one of these services at Saint Roch is provided by Dr Charles Burney who recounts that, on Sunday 17 June 1770, he left a dinner early in order to hear the \\"celebrated\\" Balbastre play the organ at Saint Roch. Balbastre \\"performed in all styles in accompanying the choir. When the Magnificat was sung, he played likewise between each verse several minuets, fugues, imitations, and every species of music, even to hunting pieces and jigs, without surprising or offending the congregation, as far as I was able to discover.\\"Preface to Curtis (ed.), CB Balbastre : Pi√®ces de Clavecin d'Orgue, de Forte Piano, Huegel, 1973, p. VIII Burney visited Balbastre at home and reported that the latter owned a very beautiful harpsichord by Ruckers : \\"After church M. Balbastre invited me to his house, to see a fine Rucker harpsichord which he has had painted inside and out with as much delicacy as the finest coach or even snuff-box I ever saw at Paris.\\" He also reported that he owned a \\"very large organ, with pedals, which it may be necessary for a French organist to have for practice; it is too large and coarse for a chamber, and the keys are as noisy as those at St. Roque (sic).\\" Burney reports that Balbastre was on very good terms with his fellow composer Armand-Louis Couperin, to whom he introduced Burney, remarking \\"I was glad to see two eminent men of the same profession, so candid and friendly together.\\" In 1763, he married Marie-Genevi√®ve Hotteterre, daughter of Jacques Martin Hotteterre and descendant of the famous family of Norman musicians. During the French Revolution, Balbastre's connection with nobility and the royal court might have endangered his life, but he adapted to the new political situation, playing the Revolutionary hymns and songs on his organ.

Pedro was also Viceroy of Naples, (1582‚Äì1586), Ambassador in Portugal and 5th Count of Ure√±a. The fortunes of the town of Osuna started to rise in the mid-15th century. At that time, Osuna was ruled by Pedro Gir√≥n Acu√±a Pacheco, the younger brother of Juan Pacheco. His son Alfonso T√©llez-Gir√≥n de las Casas was elevated to Count of Ure√±a in 1464 by King Enrique IV of Castile. The dynasty's influence increased, obtaining the title of Duke of Osuna in 1562. Osuna became the Andalusian capital of the domains of the T√©llez-Gir√≥n family, who carried the ducal title. Some of the most notable members of the House of Osuna were Pedro T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 3rd Duke of Osuna, who was a general and viceroy of Naples.

The outcome of this marriage between the Ana de Velasco y T√©llez-Gir√≥n and the Duke Teod√≥sio II, was that they were the parents of John IV of Portugal \\"the Restorer\\", (Vila Vi√ßosa, 18 March 1604 ‚Äì Lisbon, 6 November 1656), the first Braganza to be crowned King of Portugal, following the nacionalist coup against the Spanish Habsburgs, on 1 December 1640. It was alleged that being already a Duke, he fathered an illegitimate son, known as Gabriel T√©llez, becoming an active Member and Travel Visitor of the Religious Orden de la Merced, and being known today as famous Spanish theatrical author Tirso de Molina, (1584 ‚Äì Soria, 12 March 1648). * Don Francisco T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 6th Duke of Osuna : Married in 1694, aged 16, Maria Remigia Fern√°ndez de Velasco y Tovar, but there was not adult male issue. He was a supporter of King Philip V of Spain and plenipotentiary signer of the Treaty of Utrecht. * Francisco de Borja T√©llez-Gir√≥n y Pimentel, 10th Duke of Osuna : Painted by Goya as a child together with his eldest sister, Maria Joaquina T√©llez-Gir√≥n y Pimentel. Married 19 March 1802, at 17, 17th year old Fran√ßoise Philippine Thomas de Beaufort-Spontin y Toledo, (Paris 7 March 1785 ‚Äì 28 January 1830), daughter of Count and Marquis Friedrich August Alex von Beaufort-Spontin, who also became c. 1782 Duke von Beaufort-Spontin (Namur 14 September 1751 ‚Äì Brussels 22 April 1817), and Leopoldina de Toledo y Salm-Salm, (Madrid, 1760 ‚Äì Brussels, 4 July 1792). * Mariano T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 12th Duke of Osuna : He represented Spain in the crowning of Queen Victoria in England and in the marriage in 1853 of Spanish aristocrat Eugenia de Montijo to Napoleon III. He is reported by Spanish diplomat and notorious writer Juan Valera, later Spanish Ambassador in the US, to have spent with him, Embassy Officer, and his extravagant Russian friends, while Spanish Ambassador in Russia (1856‚Äì1862), incredible amounts of money in Saint Petersburg. When Mariano died in 1882, aged 68, there were lawsuits from pretenders supposed to be closely connected to the family, as well as creditors racing many of the buildings, castles, lands, artworks, etc. Closer inspections around many of the accumulated nobility titles reveal that they are held now by rather ambiguous persons (legally speaking about their supposed inheritance rights). He married in Wiesbaden, 4 April 1866, Marie Eleonore zu Salm-Salm, n√©e Princess zu Salm-Salm, (Hessen, Frankfurt am Mein, 31 January 1842 ‚Äì D√ºlmen, 18 June 1891), who became thus the 12th Duchess Consort of Osuna. She married again the Duc of Croy when Mariano died but there was no issue from both marriages. Notice that the Salm-Salm family had entered already within the Osuna family through the Count, Marquis and Duke Friedrich, (deceased 1817), and his first wife Leopoldina de Toledo y Salm- Salm, (deceased 1792), parents-in-law of the 10th Duke of Osuna.

Otto Malling was born in Copenhagen. He became a pupil of Niels Wilhelm Gade and Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann; in his later career he mainly composed organ works and vocal music, but he also wrote a Fantasia for Violin and Orchestra (in F major, opus 20), an appealing Schumannesque piano trio (in A minor, opus 36, 1889), piano quartet (in C minor, opus 80), and a Brahmsian piano concerto in C minor (opus 43, 1890), all of which are recorded and infrequently heard in concert. His output also contains among other substantial works a cantata Det hellige Land, opus 46, (published in 1897), a symphony in D minor, opus 17 (published in 1884), and an octet for strings, opus 50 (published in or before 1907). Malling wrote the first Danish textbook in orchestration, along French conservatory lines. He taught musical theory to Knud√•ge Riisager in 1915. He was also a music editor, creating piano reductions and vocal scores of works by Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann, Niels Wilhelm Gade and Christian Julius Hansen for the publisher Samfundet til udgivelse af dansk Musik. He was a co-founder and vice-conductor of The Concert Society, Copenhagen (1874), supporting himself as organist at various Copenhagen churches. His scores of organ music brought Malling some reputation abroad, but after his death he was soon forgotten in his native country, as musical tastes changed. In the late 20th century, several of his concert works were recorded.

M. W. Turner Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey is a poem by William Wordsworth. The title, Lines Written (or Composed) a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye during a Tour, July 13, 1798, is often abbreviated simply to Tintern Abbey, although that building does not appear within the poem. It was written by Wordsworth after a walking tour with his sister in this section of the Welsh Borders. The description of his encounters with the countryside on the banks of the River Wye grows into an outline of his general philosophy. There has been considerable debate about why evidence of the human presence in the landscape has been downplayed and in what way the poem fits within the 18th-century loco-descriptive genre.  Background  The poem has its roots in Wordsworth's personal history. He had previously visited the area as a troubled twenty-three-year-old in August 1793. Since then he had matured and his seminal poetical relationship with Samuel Taylor Coleridge had begun. Wordsworth claimed to have composed the poem entirely in his head, beginning it upon leaving Tintern and not jotting down so much as a line until he reached Bristol, by which time it had just reached mental completion. Although the Lyrical Ballads upon which the two friends had been working was by then already in publication, he was so pleased with what he had just written that he had it inserted at the eleventh hour as the concluding poem. Scholars generally agree that it is apt, for the poem represents the climax of Wordsworth's first great period of creative output and prefigures much of the distinctively Wordsworthian verse that was to follow.Arthur Beatty, William Wordsworth, his doctrine and art in their historical relations, University of Wisconsin Studies #17, 1922, p.64 The poem is written in tightly-structured decasyllabic blank verse and comprises verse-paragraphs rather than stanzas. Categorising the poem is difficult, as it contains some elements of the ode and of the dramatic monologue. In the second edition of Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth noted: \\"I have not ventured to call this Poem an Ode but it was written with a hope that in the transitions, and the impassioned music of the versification, would be found the principle requisites of that species of composition.\\" The apostrophe at its beginning is reminiscent of the 18th century landscape-poem, but it is now agreed that the best designation of the work would be the conversation poem, which is an organic development of the loco-descriptive.J. Robert Barth, Romanticism and Transcendence: Wordsworth, Coleridge, and the Religious, University of Missouri, 2003, p.79 The silent listener in this case is Wordsworth's sister Dorothy, who is addressed in the poem's final section. Transcending the nature poetry written before that date, it employs a much more intellectual and philosophical engagement with the subject that verges on pantheism.Geoffrey Durrant, p. 24. Outline of themes The poem's tripartite division encompasses a contextual scene- setting, a developing theorisation of the significance of his experience of the landscape, and a final confirmatory address to the implied listener. :Lines 1‚Äì49 Revisiting the natural beauty of the Wye after five years fills the poet with a sense of \\"tranquil restoration\\". He recognises in the landscape something which had been so internalised as to become the basis for out of the body experience. :Lines 49‚Äì111 In \\"thoughtless youth\\" the poet had rushed enthusiastically about the landscape and it is only now that he realises the power such scenery has continued to have upon him, even when not physically present there. He identifies in it \\"a sense sublime/ Of something far more deeply interfused,/ Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns\\" (lines 95‚Äì97) and the immanence of \\"A motion and a spirit, that impels/ All thinking things, all objects of all thought,/ And rolls through all things\\" (lines 100‚Äì103). With this insight he finds in nature \\"The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,/ The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul/ Of all my moral being\\" (lines 108‚Äì111). :Lines 111‚Äì159 The third movement of the poem is addressed to his sister Dorothy, \\"my dearest Friend,/ My dear, dear Friend,\\" as a sharer in this vision and in the conviction that \\"all which we behold is full of blessings\\". It is this that will continue to create a lasting bond between them. Literary and aesthetic context Having internalised the landscape, Wordsworth claimed now ‚Äúto see into the life of things‚Äù (line 50) and, so enabled, to hear ‚Äúoftentimes/ The still sad music of humanity‚Äù (92-3), but recent critics have used close readings of the poem to question such assertions. For example, Marjorie Levinson views him ‚Äúas managing to see into the life of things only ‚Äòby narrowing and skewing his field of vision‚Äô and by excluding ‚Äòcertain conflictual sights and meanings‚Äô‚Äù. James Castell, \\"Wordsworth and the ‚ÄòLife of Things‚Äô‚Äù in The Oxford Handbook of William Wordsworth, OUP 2015, p.740 Part of her contention was that he had suppressed mention of the heavy industrial activity in the area, although it has since been argued that the ‚Äúwreaths of smoke‚Äù, playfully interpreted by Wordsworth as possible evidence ‚Äúof some Hermit‚Äôs cave‚Äù upslope, in fact acknowledges the presence of the local ironworks, or of charcoal burning, or of a paper works.Dr Dewey Hall, Romantic Naturalists, Early Environmentalists: An Ecocritical Study, Ashgate Publishing 2014, pp.124-8 A print by Thomas Hearne of the \\"Iron Forge at Tintern\\" (1795) Another contribution to the debate has been Crystal Lake's study of other poems written after a visit to Tintern Abbey, particularly those from about the same time as Wordsworth's. Noting not just the absence of direct engagement on his part with ‚Äúthe still sad music of humanity‚Äù in its present industrial manifestation, but also of its past evidence in the ruins of the abbey itself, she concludes that this ‚Äúconfirms Marjorie Levinson‚Äòs well-known argument that the local politics of the Monmouthshire landscape require erasure if Wordsworth‚Äôs poem is to advance its aesthetic agenda.‚ÄùCrystal B. Lake, \\"The Life of Things at Tintern Abbey\\", Review of English Studies (2012) pp.444-465 The poems concerned include the following: * 1745. Rev. Dr. Sneyd Davies, Epistle IV ‚ÄúDescribing a Voyage to Tintern Abbey, in Monmouthshire, from Whitminster in Gloucestershire‚Äù * About 1790. Rev. Duncomb Davis, ‚ÄúPoetical description of Tintern Abbey‚Äù * 1790s. Edmund Gardner, ‚ÄúSonnet written in Tintern Abbey‚Äù * 1796.

His fellow clergyman Duncomb Davis, being from the area, goes into more detail. After a historical deviation, he returns to the present, where ::‚Ä¶ now no bell calls monks to morning prayer, ::Daws only chant their early matins there, ::Black forges smoke, and noisy hammers beat ::Where sooty Cyclops puffing, drink and sweat, following this with a description of the smelting process and a reflection that the present is more virtuous than the past. He anticipates Wordsworth by drawing a moral lesson from the scene, in his case noting the ivy-swathed ruin and exhorting, ::Fix deep the bright exemplar in thy heart: ::To friendship‚Äôs sacred call with joy attend, ::Cling, like the ivy, round a falling friend.Quoted in Heath's guide to Tintern Abbey Similar reflections appear in the two contemporary sonnets. For Edmund Gardner, ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs but a temple of a shorter date‚Äù,The sonnet originally appeared pseudonymously, accompanying a similarly moralising sonnet on the Severn in The European Magazine vol.30, p.119 while Luke Booker, embarking at sunset, hopes to sail as peacefully to the ‚Äúeternal Ocean‚Äù at death.Booker's sonnet appeared in Charles Heath‚Äôs guide to Tintern Abbey The action of Wordsworth's poem therefore takes place in an already established moral landscape. Its retrospective mood draws on a particularly 18th century emotional sensibility also found in Edward Jerningham's description of the ruins, with their natural adornments of moss and ‚Äòflow‚Äôrets‚Äô, and reflected in J. M. W. Turner‚Äôs watercolour of them. Wordsworth's preference in his poem is for the broader picture rather than human detail, but otherwise it fits seamlessly within its contemporary literary and aesthetic context.

They are associated with a region mentioned in the late 4th century as Texandria (also Toxiandria; later Toxandria, Taxandria), a named which survived into the 8th‚Äì12th centuries.  Name  = Attestations = The only inscription of the Roman period that convincingly mentions the name is dated 100‚Äì225 AD and gives the form Texand(ri). It was found on an altar in Brocolitia (Carrowburgh Fort) near Hadrian's Wall. A more uncertain inscription from Romania dated 102/103 AD reads Texu<...> and they are mentioned as Texuandri by Pliny (1st c. AD),Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:106 which may suggest that the two forms Texuandri and Texandri co-existed during the late-1st and 2nd centuries. The variant form Toxiandria is only attested once in a 9th-century manuscript of Ammianus Marcellinus' Res Gestae (ca. 390) to designate the region, and the variant Taxandria occurs five times in 9th- century sources, and also in later documents. The inconsistencies in spelling may be explained by dittography (errors by copyists), or by the fact that the old form Texandri had fallen out of usage. = Etymology = The name Texandri, reconstructed in early West Germanic dialects as *tehswandr≈çz, is generally assumed to stem from the Proto-Germanic root *tehsw≈ç(n)- ('right [hand], south'; compare with Old Saxon tesewa, Gothic taihswa, 'right, south') attached to the contrasting suffix *-dra-. The name can thus be interpreted as 'those of who live south/on the right bank [of the Meuse or Rhine river'], and the region of Texandria as the 'land of the southerners'. J. Mansion (1924) has proposed an alternative etymology from *texs-wandra-, formed with the West Germanic root wandra-, which might be related to English wander and Dutch wandelen, and it has also been speculated that Texandri may be a Latinized form of the tribal name Eburones, eburos and taxus meaning 'yew' in Gaulish and Latin, respectively. The region of Texandria, attested as Toxiandriam ca. 390 (pagus Texandrie in 709), and the city of Tessenderlo, attested as Tessenderlon in 1135, are probably named after the tribe.  Geography  The Texandri dwelled in a territory situated between the Scheldt and Rhine rivers, alongside other contemporary tribes like the Tungri. Roman writer Pliny (1st c. AD) connected the Texandri to the river Scaldis (modern Scheldt) but the handwritten versions of the sentence a Scaldi incolunt Texuandri are ambiguous. The manuscripts variously have texero, exerni, extera, or externi, which could be interpreted as 'at the Scheldt river', although some translations portray them as 'beyond' that river. It is assumed that the territory of the Texandri mostly corresponded to the region of Texandria mentioned by Ammianus ca. 390 AD. In the 380s, the Salian Franks, after being defeated by Julian ca. 358, were given permission to settle apud Toxiandriam locum ('at a place in Toxiandria'). If depopulation had already begun in the area by the late-2nd century (reaching its peak in the late 3rd and during the 4th century), human occupation continued along the Meuse river during the period, and it is unlikely that the sandy areas of modern North Brabant were completely deserted when Frankish settlers recolonized the area from the 5th century. According to Bijsterveld and Toorians (2018), \\"it can be plausibly argued that those living there as well as the neighbouring population may well have kept the geographic reference to the Texuandri (or to the territory named after them) in use.\\" In sources of the period 709‚Äì795, the pagus Texandrie appears concentrated around the basin of the river Dommel and its tributaries, between the towns of Alphen, Waalre and Overpelt. It later extended from the 9th century as the result of a growing network of alliances.  History  =Early reports= In the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder reported that the Texandri consisted of several smaller tribes with various names, which could mean that they emerged after several smaller ethnic groups merged into a larger one or joined together. From military records around the empire it appears that the Texandri may have formed at least one administrative district or \\"pagus\\" which contributed troops to Roman armies, but it appears to be associated with more than one higher level district or civitas. One is the Civitas Tungrorum, the civitas of the Tungri, but there also seems to be an association with the civitas of the Nervii, to the west of the Tungri., page 53-54. The modern town of Tongerloo, named after the Tungri, is very close to Tessenderlo, but actually further from the capital city of the Tungri, modern Tongeren. The relationship between the Tungri and Texandri is unclear. Prior to Pliny, the Texandri were not mentioned by Julius Caesar or Strabo in their reports of the region. If the Texandri were not a new name for an older group, then the Texandri and indeed the Tungri, whose name also only appears for the first time in Roman times, may have been made up of Germanic immigrants from the east of the Rhine, settling Roman territory, as certainly happened closer to the Rhine - for example the Ubii to the east near Cologne, the Cugerni to the northeast near Xanten, and the Batavians and Canenefates directly to the north of the Texandri, in the Rhine-Meuse delta. Tacitus, however, does not mention the Texandri, but specifically mentions that the Tungri, unlike the Ubii, Batavians and Canenefates who he also discusses, had simply changed tribal name, having previously been known as the (cisrhenane) Germani, a grouping which had included the Eburones.Tacitus, Germania, II 2. ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniamqui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, nongentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore obmetum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur. Before the Roman takeover of this region, in Julius Caesar's commentary, the tribal boundaries in the area where the Texandri are later found are left unclear. He described it as thorny low forest and marshy lowlands, northwards of the main populations of the cisrhenane Germani and Nervii. Caesar mentions both these politically important tribes retreating into such northern estuarine areas when threatened, but more clearly connects those regions to the Menapii, who in Caesar's time, as opposed to Strabo's, stretched through the delta all the way to the Rhine. At one point Caesar specifically says that the cisrhenane Germani bordering the Menapii were the Eburones, who he describes as the biggest and most important tribe of the Germani.\\"The Menapii bordered on the territories of the Eburones, and were protected by one continued extent of morasses and woods.\\" Caes. Gal. 6.5 =Ambivariti= In one isolated passage, Caesar did apparently describe a tribe near the area of the later Texandri, the Ambivariti. He describes their position incidentally only, mentioning that a raiding group of Tencteri and Usipetes from east of the Rhine had crossed it at a point where Menapii lived on both sides of the river, and then crossed the Meuse (Dutch Maas) in order to raid the Ambivariti. However, Caesar does not describe the associations of these people with any others.Caes. Gal. 4.9 The 4th/5th century Christian writer Orosius also listed the Ambivariti (Ambiuaritos) as one of the allies of the Veneti in their rebellion against Caesar.Orosius, Historiae Adversus Paganos 6.8 Latin, English. However Caesar's list mentioned the \\"Ambiliatos\\" in his similar list of Veneti allies.Caesar, Gallic War, 3.9. and the \\"Ambibari\\" in a list of similar coastal peoples.Caesar, Gallic War, 7.75. Caesar had also mentioned \\"Ambivaretis\\" as dependents of the Aedui.Caesar, Gallic War, 7.75. There may thus be errors in the transmission of these names and similar sounding ones.John Murray, 1854, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography Ambivareti. =Later Texandria= In the middle of the 4th century, the area of Texandri became very de-populated, and was exposed to constant raiding from tribes across the Rhine, outside the empire. Having been amongst the worst raiders, the Salian Franks were eventually settled as foederati in Texandria. Julian the Apostate had at first fought against Saxons and Franks, including the Salians, but then allowed this one group \\"descended from the Franks\\" to settle in Texandria in 358. According to Zosimus, in the years previous to this agreement, the Salians had already settled in the island of the Batavians, a border island of the Roman empire, forced there by Saxons from northern Germany. But they had come under attack from Saxons, who were this time raiding Roman territory (and the Salians) from the sea. > \\"[Julian] commanded his army to attack them briskly; but not to kill any of > the Salii, or prevent them from entering the Roman territories, because they > came not as enemies, but were forced there [...] As soon as the Salii heard > of the kindness of Caesar, some of them went with their king into the Roman > territory, and others fled to the extremity of their country, but all humbly > committed their lives and fortunes to Caesar's gracious protection.\\"Zosimus > Nova Historia Book III The Salians then became Roman allies (foederati) and provided troops for the imperial army, in the very period that Roman influence in the area was weakening. Texandria therefore eventually became the name of a Frankish county in early medieval Lower Lotharingia. Texandria is mentioned as a large county in the 870 Treaty of Meersen, and remained the name of a large diocese of the Catholic church during the Middle Ages, under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Li√®ge, which was originally conceived as the diocese of the Roman administrative area of the Tungri.

He led Spanish troops during the French Revolutionary Wars. Biography =Family= After April 1787, when his father, the 8th Duke, Pedro Zoilo T√©llez Gir√≥n y de Guzm√°n (27 June 1728 ‚Äì 1 April 1787) died, he was a co-founder of a society for the promotion of national cultural consciousness, known as Sociedad Econ√≥mica de Amigos del Pa√≠s (Madrid branch). His mother was really named Mar√≠a Vicenta Tellez-Gir√≥n (born 28 July 1735 ‚Äì died ????), but even so he is known as a Pacheco, perhaps because of the extensive family connections between T√©llez-Gir√≥ns and Pachecos since the 15th century. In 1772, he married Mar√≠a Josefa Pimentel, 12th Countess-Duchess of Benavente. She was 15th Countess of Benavente, Grandee of Spain, 13th Duchess of B√©jar, Duchess of Arcos, Duchess of Gand√≠a and Duchess of Monteagudo, Princess of Esquilache and Marquise of Lombay, whose possessions and noble titles were absorbed thereto by the Osuna family. =Military career= T√©llez-Gir√≥n held important commands during the War of the Pyrenees which began on 7 March 1793 and ended with the Peace of Basel on 22 July 1795. As a Lieutenant General, he commanded a column under Captain General Antonio Ricardos in the Battle of Mas Deu in the eastern Pyrenees on 19 May 1793. Soon after the battle, he transferred out of Ricardos' Army of Catalonia.Prats, Mas Deu He later fought in the western Pyrenees. In the fall of 1794, he was placed in charge of the defense of Navarre. The Army of the western Pyrenees under French General Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey defeated his badly outnumbered troops in the Battle of Orbaitzeta in October 1794, though he was able to keep the French from capturing the city of Pamplona. Portraits In a famous portrait, Goya portrays the Duke of Osuna without any medals in front of a dark background. The only indication of his military background is the baton he holds. One of his children was Joaquina T√©llez-Gir√≥n, Marchioness of Santa Cruz, who was also portrayed by Goya.

The river flows northwest through the Carmel Valley with its mouth at the Pacific Ocean south of Carmel-by-the-Sea, at Carmel Bay. It is often considered the northern boundary of Big Sur. The Carmel River drains a watershed of about 255 square miles (660 km¬≤). History The mouth of the Carmel River was first seen by Spanish explorer Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no shortly before he landed in Monterey Bay in December 1602. He wrote about visiting the river on January 3, 1603, but greatly exaggerated its proportions, confusing later explorers. Later that winter the local springs near Monterey froze, and the explorers had to cross the peninsula to find freshwater. Fathers Jun√≠pero Serra and Juan Cresp√≠ moved Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo from Monterey to its present site by the Carmel River in 1771, they directed Indian laborers to dig ditches from the Carmel River to water their crops. The river has supplied ranchers and residents ever since. After railroad baron Charles Crocker built the Hotel Del Monte, he commissioned construction of the so- called Chinese Dam in 1883 on the upper river near present-day Cachagua. It supplied 400 acre-feet of water annually to the hotel.Schmalz, David Just as the Carmel River is bouncing back, its most iconic species‚Äîsteelhead trout‚Äîare under attack September 21, 2017 Monterey County Weekly In his 1945 novel Cannery Row John Steinbeck wrote \\"The Carmel is a lovely little river. It isn't very long but in its course it has everything a river should have.\\" = Etymology = Vizcaino named it Rio del Carmelo, likely because his voyage was accompanied by three Carmelite friars. Ecology The river flows through various habitats beyond its bankside riparian zone: starting in mixed evergreen forests, then down through montane chaparral and woodlands to remnant coastal sage and chaparral and coastal prairie, concluding through minor coastal sand dunes at its Pacific mouth. Stream restoration and conservation projects are proceeding to return/enhance migrating fish in the family Salmonidae, such as the steelhead trout, and other aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna to the Carmel River ecosystem. Dams and reservoirs Along the Carmel River Trail upstream of the Los Padres Dam The Carmel River had three dams, with their reservoirs used for drinking water and having severe sediment buildup. The San Clemente Dam, built in 1921, was located upstream from the ocean, and once provided drinking water throughout the Monterey Peninsula. It was the second of three dams built on the Carmel River, preceded by the Old Carmel River Dam built in the 1880s and followed by the Los Padres Dam in 1949. The San Clemente Dam had an original capacity of , but as of 2002, the capacity had fallen to less than because it was 90 percent silted up. Carmel River - Garland Ranch Regional Park State regulators declared in 1991 that it was in danger of collapsing in an earthquake and spilling the of water trapped behind its crumbling walls. In January 2010 an agreement was reached with the California American Water Company to dig a new half-mile channel to bypass and strand the sediment behind the dam at a cost of $84 million, beginning in 2013. The Carmel River Reroute and San Clemente Dam Removal Project (CRRDR) was completed at the end of 2015, opening up of historic steelhead rainbow trout habitat on the river mainstem, plus access to three named tributary creeks: San Clemente Creek, Pine Creek and Cachagua Creek. The Los Padres Dam, built in 1949, is located upstream from the ocean. Its original capacity was , but as of 2008, its capacity was only . The oldest dam on the river, which was used as a turnout for a water pipeline, was located approximately downstream of San Clemente Dam. It was removed as part of the San Clemente Dam Removal Project. This first dam and associated pipeline was constructed ca. 1880 by Charles Crocker and the Pacific Improvement Company with a labor force that included approximately 700 Chinese workers. This small dam, which has been referred to as the \\"Chinese Dam\\" and \\"Old Carmel River Dam,\\" was built using hewn and mortared granite blocks. A cast-iron pipe long and in diameter was used to deliver water from the dam to the first Del Monte Hotel on the Monterey Peninsula, crossing the Carmel River five times on its way. Remnants of the original iron pipe still exist along Carmel Valley Road, but no records have been found to show where the pipe crossed the river.

Buta Kola is a ritual folk dance from the coastal districts and some parts of malenadu of Karnataka, India. The dance is highly stylized and held in honor of the local deities worshiped by the Tulu speaking population. It has influenced Yakshagana folk theatre.  Definition  The Word is derived from b≈´ta (Tulu for ‚Äòspirit‚Äô, ‚Äòdeity‚Äô; in turn derived from Sanskrit ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§ for ‚Äòfree elements‚Äô,'which is purified','fit','proper', ‚Äòtrue‚Äô,'past','creatures'; Anglicized: ‚Äòbhuta‚Äô, ‚Äòbhoota‚Äô, ‚Äòbootha‚Äô) and k≈çla (Tulu for ‚Äòplay, performance, festival‚Äô). A b≈´ta k≈çla or nema is typically an annual ritual performance where local spirits or deities (b≈´tas, daivas) are being channelised by ritual specialists from certain scheduled castes such as the Nalike, Pambada, or Parawa communities. The b≈´ta cult is prevalent among the non-Brahmin Tuluvas of Tulu Nadu region . The word k≈çla is conventionally reserved for the worship of a single spirit whereas a nƒìma involves the channelising of several spirits in hierarchical order. In k≈çlas and nƒìmas family and village disputes are referred to the spirit for mediation and adjudication. In feudal times, the justice aspect of the ritual included matters of political justice, such as the legitimation of political authority, as well as aspects of distributive justice. The produce of land directly owned by the b≈´ta (commons) as well as certain contributions from the leading manors was redistributed among the villagers.  Performance  The ritual performance at a b≈´ta k≈çla or daiva nƒìma involves music, dance, recital, and elaborate costumes. Recitals in Old Tulu recount the origins of the deity and tell the story of how it came to the present location. These epics are known as pƒÅ·∏çdanas.  Types of B≈´tas  Thurston counts among the best known deities \\"Brahmeru, Kodamanitaya, Kukkintaya, Jumadi, Sarala Jumadi, Pancha Jumadi, Rakteswari, Panjurli, Kuppe Panjurli, Rakta Panjurli, Jarandaya, Urundarayya, Hosadƒìvata (or Hosa Bh≈´ta), Dƒìvanajiri, Kalku·∏ça, Tukkateri, Gulige, Bobbariya, Nicha, Duggalaya, Mahisandaya, Varte, ChƒÅmundi, Baiderukulu, Ukkatiri, Kallurti, Shiraadi, Ullalthi, Okkuballala, Koddabbu and Odityay. According to some, Jumadi is the small-pox goddess MƒÅri. The Bh≈´tas are supposed to belong to different castes. For example Okkuballala and Dƒìvanajiri are Jains, Kodamanitaya and Kukkinataya are Bunts, Kalku·∏ça is a smith, Bobbariya is a MƒÅppilla, and Nicha a Koraga.\\" Some of them are ancestral spirits such as Bobbariya, Kalku·∏ça, Kallurti, Siri, KumƒÅr Koti and Chennayya. Some are deified wild animals such as the boar - Pa≈àjurli (the female counterpart is Varte Pa≈àjurli) or the tiger - PilichƒÅmu·πá·∏çi. Some b≈´tas are Androgynous such as some instances of Jumadi who is represented as female below the neck (breasts), but with a male head sporting a mustache. There are anthropomorphic b≈´tas, zoomorphic ones, and mixed forms (such as the MalarƒÅya of Kodlamogaru, Kasargod, who has the head of a wild boar and the body of a woman). Depending on the significance of the people who worship them, b≈´tas or daivas can be family deities (ku·π≠u·πÉbada b≈´ta), local or village deities (jƒÅgeda b≈´ta, ≈´rada b≈´ta), or deities associated with administrative units such as manorial estates (gu»õ»õus), groups of estates (mƒÅgane), districts (sƒ´me) or even small kingdoms (royal b≈´tas or rajandaivas). =Bh≈´ta worship types= The Bh≈´ta worship of South Canara is of four kinds, k≈çla, bandi, nƒìma, and agelu- tambila. :K≈çla : Demi god dancing, is offered to the Bh≈´tas in the sthana of the village believed that which they are supposed to reside. :Bandi: Bandi is the same as k≈çla, with the addition of dragging about a clumsy kind of car, on which the one who representing the Bh≈´ta is seated mostly it is nalke, pambada, ajala community. :Nƒìma: Nƒìma is a private ceremony in honour of the Bh≈´tas, held in the house of anyone who is so inclined. It is performed once in every year two, ten, fifteen, or twenty years by well-to-do their family. :Agelu-tambila: is a kind of worship offered only to the family people, wherein rice, dishes, meat, alcohol are served on plantain leaves and offered to spirits, deities, departed forefathers by annually or once wishes completed.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Castes_and_Tribes_of_Southern_India/Nalke  Cosmology  According to the ethnographer Peter Claus, the Tulu pƒÅ·∏çdanas reveal a cosmology which is distinctly Dravidian and thus different from the Puranic Hindu cosmology. Importantly, priesthood is not the preserve of a caste learned in scriptures but is shared between the ruling aristocracy on one hand and ritual specialists from the lower strata of society on the other hand. The world is divided in two three realms: firstly, the realm of cultivated lands (grƒÅmya), secondly the realm of wastelands and forests (jƒÅ·πÖgala/ƒÅra·πáya), and thirdly the realm of spirits (b≈´ta-loka). GrƒÅmya and jƒÅ·πÖgala/ƒÅra·πáya form part of the tangible world, whereas b≈´ta-loka is their intangible counterpart. As grƒÅmya is constantly threatened by encroachment, disease, hunger and death form jƒÅ·πÖgala and ƒÅra·πáya, so is the tangible world under constant threat from the intangible world of the spirits. The world of the forest is the \\"world of the wild, unordered, uncontrolled, hungry beings of destruction\\". The world of the forest and the world of the spirits are therefore seen as mirror images of each other. The wild animals threatening the human cultivator and his fields such as the tiger, the snake, the wild- boar, and the bison, find their mirror images in their corresponding b≈´tas Pilli, Naga, Pa≈àjurli and Maisandaya. The relationship between these three worlds is one of balance and moral order. If this order is upset by the humans, it is believed that the spirits become vicious. If the order is maintained, the spirits are believed to be supportive and benevolent. Thus, the spirits of Tulu culture are neither ‚Äògood‚Äô nor ‚Äòbad‚Äô as such; they are \\"neither cruel nor capricious. They methodically and persistently remind a lax humanity of the need for morality and the value of solidarity\\". Nobody is believed to be above the moral and cosmological norms of this threefold universe, not even the spirits or the gods. Thus the b≈´tas are not whimsical or arbitrary in their judgement. The b≈´tas are their patron's protectors with regard to a system of moral norms, not despite them. Feudal relations of tribute and fealty mark the relations among the humans in the tangible world, among spirits in the intangible world and between humans and spirits across tangible and intangible worlds. While the world of humans is ruled by a mortal king, the world of the spirits is ruled by Bermeru, the lord of the forest and of the b≈´tas. And just as the landed aristocracy depended on protection and support from their king, the world of humans depends on protection and support from the spirits. Thus once in a year at the time of k≈çla or nƒìma, the lord of the human world (patriarch, landlord, king) has to be reconfirmed in his authority by reporting to the spirit to which he is accountable. While the temporal lord's authority is dependent on the spirit; the authority of the spirit is guaranteed by the active participation of the villagers in the ritual. Thereby a certain degree of political legitimacy is upheld by the active participation of the villagers. Their withdrawal from the ritual can seriously affect the authority of the landlord. As Claus observes, the principal mediators in this network of feudal transactions are communities who once upon a time may have led a liminal life between grƒÅmya and jƒÅ·πÖgala/ƒÅra·πáya. Tribal communities living in and off the forest and trading in forest products were predestined to serve as spirit impersonators as their life world, the forest, is only the tangible side of the world of the spirits. In pursuit of their livelihood they regularly transgress structural boundaries between village and forest. They live on the margins of the village, in the wasteland between forest and field, thus they are themselves, in a sense, liminal. That such liminal people should be mediums for the spirits seems entirely apt. Today communities like Nalike, Parava or Pambada who impersonate different kinds of b≈´tas and daivas can no longer be characterised as tribal. They are mostly landless agricultural labourers in the wet season and spirit impersonators in the dry season.  Worship  The temple of the deity Jumadi in Mangalore, India Today feudal relations no longer obtain and thus former ruling families no longer hold any political or judicial office. But still the village demands that they sponsor their annual k≈çla or nƒìma to honour the village deity. The people believe that the neglect of the spirits will make their life miserable. Even though they may have changed, b≈´ta k≈çla and daiva nƒìma still serve secular as well as religious purposes. In fact the two cannot be separated in a world where the tangible is suffused with the intangible. As the cosmology underlying the pƒÅ·∏çdanas suggests, the very order of the human world and the order of the spirit world are interdependent. B≈´tas and daivas are not worshipped on a daily basis like mainstream Hindu gods. Their worship is restricted to annual ritual festivals, though daily p≈´jƒÅs may be conducted for the ritual objects, ornaments, and other paraphernalia of the b≈´ta. Unlike with the better-known Hindu gods of the purƒÅ·πáic variety, b≈´ta worship is congregational.  Secular function  The secular function of the k≈çla or nƒìma has been described as a \\"sacred court of justice\\" where traditional (feudal) moral ideals are brought to bear on difficult real-life situations. B≈´ta k≈çlas and daiva nƒìmas are assemblies of the entire village. Thus they become an occasion to resolve conflicts in the village. The royal daiva (rƒÅjan-daiva) rules over a former small kingdom or large feudal estate. He or she is mostly the family deity of rich land-owning patrons of the Ba·πá·π≠ caste whose position and power they reflect, confirm and renew. The relationship between the b≈´tas, manor heads, and the villagers forms a transactional network which reaffirms the caste hierarchy and power relations in a village. The duty assigned to every category is differential but based on mutuality. The manor head by staging the nƒìma seeks to symbolically proclaim himself to be the natural leader of the community. The villagers offer sƒìva during the nƒìma in the form of service and prostrations and in doing so also offer their support to the nƒìma and their recognition of the leader's status. In return, the villagers expect justice and resolution of disputes by the daiva during the nƒìma. In the nƒìma, the leading manors offer a part of their farm products to the daiva, which are then redistributed to the villagers. The nƒìma thereby underlines the mutuality on which feudal relations used to be based and, in a limited way, takes care of the problem of social (distributive) justice. The b≈´tas receive these offerings and in return give oracles and blessings to ensure the future prosperity of the village (humans, animals, fields). Finally, a part of these offerings will be distributed as prasƒÅda among the heads of the gu·π≠·π≠us and other villagers according to their ranks. The system of entitlements is constituted in, or embodied by, the mutual gifting activity between the b≈´tas, as the ultimate owner of the land, and people in rituals, creating a transactional network among them.  Ritual script  The script of the ritual changes from one nƒìmƒÅ to another, thus the following description is somewhat ideal-typical. The ritual begins with the paraphernalia of the b≈´ta being brought to the shrine which serves as a venue for the festival. They are placed on an altar or on a swinging cot, which is the insignium of a royal b≈´ta (rajan-daiva). The Nalike, Parava or Pambada medium prepares for the impersonation of the spirit with a recital of from the pƒÅ·∏çdana of the b≈´ta or daiva. After this, the medium starts putting on make-up and dressing up in his costume which may include an elaborate ani (a giant halo stringed to the back of the dancer). Finally, the medium is given the ornaments from the hoard of the shrine. As he enters the arena, the attendant of the spirit (pƒÅtri) gives him his sword, his bell and other paraphernalia and the patron (jajmƒÅn) gives him one or several burning torches. As the medium begins to dance, the spirit enters his body. Two people hold the torches along with the medium at all times. Thus, the entrance of spirit into this world is restrained. The medium's dance gains more force as the possession continues. He brings the torches dangerously close to his body. The jajmƒÅn now stands in a ritualistic circle on the ground with his assistants and offerings are made to the b≈´ta. These offerings often include the sacrifice of a chicken whose blood is sprinkled on the ground to enhance the fertility of the land. These sacrificial acts are followed by offerings of puffed rice, beaten rice, coconut pieces, bananas, ghee, betel leaf, and areca nut. In the subsequent court of justice the spirit is approached by the villagers for blessings or asked to help resolve conflicts. The judicial program typically starts once the initial rituals are finished. Complaints and judgements are made orally. The b≈´ta issues the judgement after hearing the sides of the plaintiff as well as the defendant, if both are present. The b≈´ta's justice must be referrable to general principles. \\"He may take a stand, he cannot take sides\\". While the b≈´ta may take the opinions of the village headman and other eminent persons into consideration, the ultimate judgement rests with the b≈´ta. Sometimes judgements are also issued by the tossing of betel leaves and the counting of flower petals (usually areca flower). Particularly difficult cases may also be adjourned to the next year by the b≈´ta. Some common disputes that come up are related to land issues, family feuds, questions of honour, robbery, debt, mortgage, breach of contract etc. In cases of theft where the offender is unknown, the b≈´ta may ask for a certain offering before finding the thief. At times the victim offers the entire value of the stolen goods to the b≈´ta. If the thief is found and penalised, the person is made to pay to the plaintiff a sum that is more than the value of the goods stolen. If the b≈´ta feels that the thief shows repentance, the gravity of the penalty could be reduced.  Possession  Buta Kola dancer from the Parava caste. circa 1909 The art of being a channel/medium is learned. Young boys belonging to the Pambada, Parava, Nalike castes attend rituals where their kin is performing; and they help out with shredding the coconut leaves for the garment of the channel/medium, holding the mirror while the channel/medium is putting on the make up etc. They learn the art of the performance by observing the performance of their kin and trying to mimic it. Along with being able to mimic the way their kin performed, what is essential to be a successful channel/medium is also the aptitude of being possessed by the deity. There are certain rules the channel/medium needs to follow to prepare his body for the possession. This may include being a vegetarian and not drinking alcohol. The channel/medium feels the sudden spirit possession only for a few seconds but after that he is filled with the deity's energy that lets him behave as the deity for the entire ritual. There are two types of mediators between the spirits and the humans. The first type of mediator is known as the pƒÅtri. These are members of middle castes such as Billava (toddy tappers, formerly also bow-men). The second type of mediator (\\"channels/mediums\\") typically belong to scheduled castes such as Pambada, Parava or Nalike. While the pƒÅtri has only a sword and a bell as ritual tools, the channel/medium uses makeup, ornaments, masks etc. Both mediums are believed to channelise the deity from an altered state of consciousness. But while the channel/medium may speak as the b≈´ta (in the first person) and about the b≈´ta (in the third person, i.e. when he recounts his/her pƒÅ·∏çdana), the pƒÅtri only speaks as the b≈´ta in the first person.  PƒÅ·∏çdana  PƒÅ·∏çdanas are major part of Tuluva oral literature. Much of the body of this literature has been built on the legends of the b≈´tas and daivas. PƒÅ·∏çdanas have numerous variations for the same narrative. As in other epic traditions, there is no single author. PƒÅ·∏çdanas are orally transmitted and recited. The language of the pƒÅ·∏çdanas is old Tulu. Some famous examples are the Siri-Kumar PƒÅ·∏çdanas and the Koti and Chennayya PƒÅ·∏çdanas. The pƒÅ·∏çdanas sung by women while planting paddy are referred to as ‚Äòfield songs‚Äô. The pƒÅ·∏çdanas recite the origins of the spirits and deities. This is one way for the rituals to reconstruct the past and render a legitimization to it. The singers act as the indigenous narrators of the history of the native land. The pƒÅ·∏çdanas also stand in opposition to the puranic, male based principles as they highlight the feminine principles of mother earth. The pƒÅ·∏çdanas also reflect multi-socio-cultural background shifts (for example, the move from Matrilineal system to Patrilineal system). The older sense of cosmology is retained through the pƒÅ·∏çdanas. The pƒÅ·∏çdanas also reflect processes of Hinduisation and Sanskritization.

The arboretum was given to Hampshire County Council in 1977 to be managed as a charitable trust. Sir Harold Hillier was knighted in 1983, just two years before his death at age 80 in 1985. The Gardens were listed as Grade II on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens in 1997.  Organisation  Run as a registered charity, the Gardens are continually developed to further Sir Harold‚Äôs philosophy of horticulture, conservation, education and recreation. The president of the trust is the Duchess of Cornwall and the patrons are Lord Sainsbury and Roy Lancaster, who was the first curator. A team of 18 experienced horticulturalists and arborists look after the collection alongside students and a team of 200 volunteers.  Collections  Autumn Colours Sir Harold Hillier Gardens has one of the largest collections of hardy trees and shrubs in the world and is famous for its collection of rare plants. = National Plant Collection = It is home to 14 National Plant Collections including: * Carpinus (hornbeam) * Cercidiphyllum (katsura trees) * Cornus (dogwoods) * Corylus (hazels) * Cotoneaster * Hamamelis (witch hazels) * Hillier Plants * Hypericum * Ligustrum (privets) * Lithocarpus (stone/tanbark oak) * Metasequoia (dawn redwoods) * Photinia (christmas berry) * Pinus (pines) * Quercus (oaks) = Champion Trees = Sir Harold Hillier Gardens has the most comprehensive collection of Champion Trees in Britain and Ireland with 611 trees that are considered to be the largest, finest, or most rare of their species, as recorded by the Tree Register of the British Isles in 2020. The collection includes Metasequoia glyptostroboides, from the original batch of seed received by the Arnold Arboretum from China and distributed in 1948, its first introduction to the West. The young shoot is the emblem of the Gardens. = Rare Plants = Wollemia nobilis Sir Harold Hillier Gardens is renowned for its collections of rare plants. Gems include: * Magnolia macrophylla subsp. dealbata, with leaves up to 3ft long and large, fragrant, white flowers. * Calycanthus x raulstonii ‚ÄòHartlage Wine‚Äô is a magnolia relative, a spice bush hybrid with large red flowers, a real exotic looking beauty. * Puya alpestris, flowering on the alpine screes. * Citrus ichangensis, a hardy species of lemon tree. * Illicium mexicanum, the large, red flowers of this Mexican native are a rare sight in this country. * Paulownia kawakamii tree is known as the Sapphire dragon tree. The violet flowers open in May and are enormous. It is classified as critically endangered. Three specimens of the fossil tree: * Wollemia nobilis, one having flowered in 2010/11 for the first time. * Quercus monimotricha a dwarf oak from China = Plant Trials = Sir Harold Hillier Gardens started a hypericum trial in 2014. This three year trial was in association with the Royal Horticultural Society and led by curator David Jewell. The aim of the trial was to establish garden worthiness, resolve any naming problems and assess their medicinal properties. The trial included approximately 65 different types of plants. The hypericum lancasteri, grown at the Gardens, is named in honour of patron Roy Lancaster. These trial grounds can be visited in the Gardens and are located behind Jermyn's House.  Conservation  Besides growing many plants rare in cultivation, the Gardens grow over 200 threatened plant species and participates in a variety of conservation programmes, including collaboration on biodiversity projects on a local, national and international level. At a press day in 1964, a journalist asked Sir Harold what he thought of the fledgling garden plant conservation movement. ‚ÄúI shall tell you what I think,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúWhilst other people are talking about it I am doing it, I am planting, planting, planting and I would urge others to do the same.‚Äù  Gardens  Magnolia Avenue A variety of landscapes have been designed for seasonal interest all year round. * Acer Valley - A valley of Japanese and other maples and shaded by mature oaks. * Bog Garden - Here bamboos are mixed with bold herbaceous perennials such as the enormous gunnera manicata * Centenary Border - originally planted in 1964 by Sir Harold Hillier to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Winchester nursery by his grandfather. It was planted with alternating 22 yard bays, to reflect Sir Harold's interest in cricket. It was decided in 2010 to develop a more suitable border and infrastructure to open up the border all year round. The Centenary Border is now the longest double mixed border in the country and was officially opened by the Duchess of Cornwall in 2013. * Children's Education Garden - created for the education programmes provided by the Gardens it includes the Mediterranean, oak and the ‚Äòmusical‚Äô bamboo \\"classrooms\\" with exotic plants and herbs. There are also six dipping ponds filled with aquatic life and dragonflies. An allotment is kept for growing vegetables. It was opened in July 2006 by David Attenborough. * Gurkha Memorial Garden - the Gurkha Memorial Garden was created in 1997 with generous funding from the Kadoorie Foundation of Hong Kong in memory of Horace Kadoorie. It is planted with a selection of Nepal's unique flora and plants originally collected as seed in Nepal. A chautara stands here, this is a stone feature that marks a traditional resting place for porters on the mountain trails of Nepal carrying goods on their backs in the typical conical wicker baskets, known as dokos. This chautara displays the badges of the 12 Ghurka regiments. *The Heather Garden - contains a range of heathers, delightful trees and shrubs. This gives all year interest of both flower and foliage. *Himalayan Valley - is lined with azaleas, rhododendrons, hydrangeas, pieris, and many other plants *Hydrangea Walk - is planted with a selection of the mophead and lacecap forms of hydrangea macrophylla. There are also some hydrangea paniculata mixed with a variety of viburnums. *Magnolia Avenue - forms an avenue running from the front of Jermyn's House. Established by Sir Harold, these magnolias are now fully mature. *Meadows - contain common spotted orchid, dactylorhiza fuchsia, yellow rattle, rhinanthus minor. *Peony Border - has around 70 different varieties of peony *Pinetum- affectionately known in its early days as ‚ÄòLittle Switzerland‚Äô was planted in the 70's. *The Pond - on the banks of the pond are several trees of swamp cypress (taxodium distichum). In the moist soil around the Pond, and in the Bog Garden, the lush foliage of numerous bamboos predominates, and herbaceous perennials. *Rhododendron Woodland - with approximately 1,307 different types of rhododendron. Here is planted a champion specimen of quercus rysophylla, which was grown from seed collected by Sir Harold while in Mexico. *Valley of Fire - lined with North American maples, sweet gum (liquidambar) and cherry trees. Shrub beds are planted with sumac and lindera * Winter Garden - was opened by Michael Heseltine in 1998. It was extended in 2014 and now covers over , one of the largest winter gardens in Europe. Many recycled and reclaimed products were used in its construction, even the irrigation pipe incorporates recycled materials, in this case reconstituted baler twine. The Winter Garden has more than 800 plants grown for their winter beauty, planted to look their best between November and March. Planting features a palette of bark, bold coloured stems, scent and foliage. It features the National Collection of witch-hazel. Highlights to see in the spring including euphorbia, helleborus, lonicera and daphne. *Wisteria Border - has 20 different wisteria  Buildings  =Visitor Pavilion= The pavilion was opened in 2003. The elegant single storey complex was designed by Hampshire County Council Architects, and has won the SCALA award for the best local authority designed building in the UK. The building is a complementary mix of modern and traditional materials. Dedicated to the memory of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and visited in 2003 by the Queen. The Visitor Pavilion hosts a gallery space, ticket desk, membership desk, restaurant, gift shop and purpose-built education facility. =Jermyn‚Äôs House= The original house here could have been built in the early 18th century. The land in 1724 was owned by Farmer Jarman. After being used as a smallpox hospital and inoculation centre in the 18th century. It passed through a number of different owners until acquired at auction by the Hillier family in 1951. The family took up residence in June 1953. The building now houses the administrative offices for the Gardens and tea rooms.  Herbarium  The Herbarium is located within Jermyn‚Äôs House and was founded in 1995 to accommodate specimens collected by Sir Harold Hillier. It was officially opened by Dr Nigel Taylor, Curator of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The Herbarium houses a particularly large collection of Quercus and it is the official repository for the International Oak Society. It holds around 8,000 specimens including specimens that are wild collected seeds or cuttings, from America, Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan. It is open for research purposes by appointment.

Although each component operates semi-independently, the three collectively form a chain leading from an investigation of suspected criminal activity to the administration of criminal punishment. Law enforcement operates primarily through governmental police agencies. There are 17,985 U.S. police agencies in the United States which include City Police Departments, County Sheriff's Offices, State Police/Highway Patrol and Federal Law Enforcement Agencies. The law-enforcement purposes of these agencies are the investigation of suspected criminal activity, referral of the results of investigations to state or federal prosecutors, and the temporary detention of suspected criminals pending judicial action. Law enforcement agencies, to varying degrees at different levels of government and in different agencies, are also commonly charged with the responsibilities of deterring criminal activity and preventing the successful commission of crimes in progress. Other duties may include the service and enforcement of warrants, writs, and other orders of the courts. Law enforcement agencies are also involved in providing first response to emergencies and other threats to public safety; the protection of certain public facilities and infrastructure; the maintenance of public order; the protection of public officials; and the operation of some detention facilities (usually at the local level). Types of police Policing in the United States is conducted by \\"around 18,000 federal, state, local and city departments, all with their own rules\\". Every state has its own nomenclature for agencies, and their powers, responsibilities and funding vary from state to state. =Federal= U.S. Park Police officers standing by during the 2005 Inauguration Day U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers board a ship. At the federal level, there exists both federal police, who possess full federal authority as given to them under United States Code (U.S.C.), and federal law enforcement agencies, who are authorized to enforce various laws at the federal level. Both police and law enforcement agencies operate at the highest level and are endowed with police roles; each may maintain a small component of the other (for example, the FBI Police). The agencies have jurisdiction in all states, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions for enforcement of federal law. Most federal agencies are limited by the U.S. Code to investigating only matters that are explicitly within the power of the federal government. However, federal investigative powers have become very broad in practice, especially since the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act. There are also federal law enforcement agencies, such as the United States Park Police, that are granted state arrest authority off primary federal jurisdiction. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for most law enforcement duties at the federal level. It includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the United States Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and others. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is another branch with numerous federal law enforcement agencies reporting to it. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), United States Secret Service (USSS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are some of the agencies that report to DHS. The United States Coast Guard is assigned to the United States Department of Defense in the event of war. At a crime or disaster scene affecting large numbers of people, multiple jurisdictions, or broad geographic areas, many police agencies may be involved by mutual aid agreements. For example, the United States Federal Protective Service responded to the Hurricane Katrina natural disaster. The command in such situations remains a complex and flexible issue. In accordance with the federal structure of the United States government, the national (federal) government is not authorized to execute general police powers by the Constitution of the United States of America. The power to have a police force is given to each of the United States' 50 federated states. The US Constitution gives the federal government the power to deal with foreign affairs and interstate affairs (affairs between the states). For police, this means that if a non-federal crime is committed in a US state and the fugitive does not flee the state, the federal government has no jurisdiction. However, once the fugitive crosses a state line, he violates the federal law of interstate flight and is subject to federal jurisdiction, at which time federal law enforcement agencies may become involved. =State= Massachusetts State Police Troopers Most states operate statewide government agencies that provide law enforcement duties, including investigations and state patrols. They may be called state police or highway patrol, and are normally part of the state Department of Public Safety. In addition, the Attorney General's office of each state has its own state bureau of investigation such as in California with the California Department of Justice. The Texas Ranger Division fulfills this role in Texas although they were founded in the period before Texas became a state. Various departments of state governments may have their own enforcement divisions, such as capitol police, campus police, state hospitals, Departments of Correction, water police, environmental (fish and game/wildlife) conservation officers or game wardens (with full police powers and statewide jurisdiction). For example, in Colorado, the Department of Revenue has its own investigative branch. =County= Also known as parishes and boroughs, county law enforcement is provided by sheriffs' departments or offices and county police. County police County police tend to exist only in metropolitan counties and have countywide jurisdiction. For places that have both county police and county sheriff, responsibilities are given to each: The county police are in charge of typical police duties such as patrol and investigations, whereas the sheriffs' department in this situation takes care of serving papers and providing security to the courts. County police tend to fall into three broad categories, full service, limited service, and restrictive service. Full service provides full police services to the entire county. Limited service provides to the unincorporated and special districts. Restricted service provide security to the county-owned parts of the county. Sheriffs' offices Sheriffs are not police and have many different responsibilities. Sheriffs are elected officials where the head of police is appointed or hired in. Sheriffs are responsible for all three parts of the criminal justice system. They uphold the county jail, ensure safety within the courts, and have jurisdiction to enforce laws in the entire county. They have more responsibilities such as transporting prisoners, running crime labs, and collecting taxes. *In Texas, the sheriff's office is normally the agency responsible for handling mental health calls. If the situation is dangerous, a sheriff's deputy has the power to take a person to a hospital on a mental health commitment immediately. However, if the situation is not actively dangerous, a warrant must be sought. With the rise in mental health units across the state, the Texas CIT Association was formed. Commonwealth of Virginia The Commonwealth of Virginia does not have overlapping county and city jurisdictions, whereas in most other states, municipalities generally fall within (and share jurisdiction and many other governmental responsibilities with) one (or more) county(ies). In Virginia, governmental power flows down from the state (or in Virginia's case, commonwealth) directly to either a county or an independent city. Thus, policing in Virginia is more streamlined: the county sheriff's office/department or county police department does not overlap with an independent city police department. Unincorporated townships remain part of their parent county but may have town police departments to augment their county law enforcement. Town police departments are often small and may deploy a combination of paid and unpaid, full and part-time law enforcement officers, including auxiliary officers who typically serve as part-time, unpaid volunteers. If present, independent city sheriff's offices usually follow the restrictive model shown above for sheriff's departments, with limited law enforcement authority including warrant service, jail bailiff, etc. Mutual assistance compacts may exist where neighboring law enforcement agencies will assist each other, however, in addition to state (commonwealth) law enforcement resources. Like most states, Virginia also has campus police officers. Under Virginia State Code 23.1-809 and 23.1-810, public and private colleges and universities can maintain their own armed police force and employ sworn campus police officers. These sworn officers have the same authority as local police and are required to complete police academy training mandated by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services. Virginia campus police officers have jurisdiction on and immediately around the campus, but police departments may petition to the local circuit court for concurrent jurisdiction with the local police. =Municipal= A Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor of the New York City Police Department Municipal police range from one-officer agencies (sometimes still called the town marshal) to the 40,000 person-strong New York City Police Department. Most municipal agencies take the form (Municipality Name) Police Department. Most municipalities have their own police departments. Metropolitan departments, such as the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, have jurisdiction covering multiple communities and municipalities, often over a wide area, and typically share geographical boundaries within one or more cities or counties. Metropolitan departments have usually been formed by a merger between local agencies, typically several local police departments and often the local sheriff's department or office, in efforts to provide greater efficiency by centralizing command and resources and to resolve jurisdictional problems, often in communities experiencing rapid population growth and urban sprawl, or in neighboring communities too small to afford individual police departments. Some county sheriff's departments, such as the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, are contracted to provide full police services to local cities within their counties. =Other= There are other types of specialist police departments with varying jurisdictions. Most of these serve special-purpose districts and are known as special district police. In some states, they serve as little more than security police, but in states such as California, special district forces are composed of fully sworn police officers with statewide authority. These agencies can be transit police, school district police, campus police, airport police, railroad police, park police or police departments responsible for protecting government property, such as the former Los Angeles General Services Police. Some agencies, such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department, have multi-state powers. There are also some Private Police agencies, such as the Parkchester Department of Public Safety and Co-op City Department of Public Safety. =Puerto Rico Police= The Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) traces back to 1837, when Spanish governor Francisco Javier de Moreda y Prieto created La Guardia Civil de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Civil Guard) to protect the lives and property of Puerto Ricans who at the time were Spanish subjects, and provide police services to the entire island, even though many municipalities maintained their own police force. The United States invaded and took possession of Puerto Rico in July 1898 as a result of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and has controlled the island as a US territory since then. The Insular Police of Puerto Rico was created on February 21, 1899, under the command of Colonel Frank Thacher (US Marine officer during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War), with an authorized strength of 313 sworn officers. As of 2009, the PRPD had over 17,292 officers. Police functions A Florida Highway Patrol state trooper at the scene of a motor vehicle accident FBI Evidence Response Team Textbooks and scholars have identified three primary police agency functions. The following is cited from The American System of Criminal Justice, by George F. Cole and Christopher E. Smith, 2004, 10th edition, Wadsworth/Thomson Learning: * Order maintenance ::This is the broad mandate to keep the peace or otherwise prevent behaviors which might disturb others. This can deal with things ranging from a barking dog to a fist-fight. By way of description, Cole and Smith note that police are usually called-on to \\"handle\\" these situations with discretion, rather than deal with them as strict violations of law, though of course their authority to deal with these situations are based in violations of law. * Law enforcement ::Those powers are typically used only in cases where the law has been violated and a suspect must be identified and apprehended. Most obvious instances include robbery, murder, or burglary. This is the popular notion of the main police function, but the frequency of such activity is dependent on geography and season. * Service ::Services may include rendering first aid, providing tourist information, guiding the disoriented, or acting as educators (on topics such as preventing drug use). Cole and Smith cited one study which showed 80% of all calls for police assistance did not involve crimes, but this may not be the case in all parts of the country. Because police agencies are traditionally available year-round, 24 hours a day, citizens call upon police departments not only in times of trouble but also when just inconvenienced. As a result, police services may include roadside auto assistance, providing referrals to other agencies, finding lost pets or property, or checking locks on vacationers' homes. =Styles of policing= Given the broad mandates of police work and the limited resources they have, police administrators must develop policies to prioritize and focus their activities. Some of the more controversial policies restrict, or even forbid, high-speed vehicular pursuits. Researchers Falcone, Wells, & Weisheit describe a historical separation of police models between small towns and larger cities. The distinction has also been defined between rural and urban policing models, which tended to function differently with separate hierarchical systems supporting each.Falcone, David N., Edward L. Wells, and Ralph A. Weisheit. \\"The Small-Town Police Department.\\" Policing 25.2 (2002): 371-85. ProQuest Criminal Justice Periodicals Index. Web. September 25, 2014. Three styles of policing develop from a jurisdiction's socioeconomic characteristics, government organization, and choice of police administrators. According to a study by James Q. Wilson (\\"Varieties of Police Behavior\\", 1968, 1978, Harvard University Press), there were three distinct types of policing developed in his study of eight communities. Each style emphasized different police functions and was linked to specific characteristics of the community the department served. *Watchman ::Emphasizes maintaining order, usually found in communities with a declining industrial base, and a blue-collar, mixed ethnic/racial population. This form of policing is implicitly less pro-active than other styles, and certain offenses may be \\"overlooked\\" on a variety of social, legal, and cultural grounds as long as public order is maintained. Cole and Smith comment the broad discretion exercised in this style of policing can result in charges of discrimination when it appears police treatment of different groups results in the perception that some groups get better treatment than others; *Legalistic ::Emphasizes law enforcement and professionalism. This is usually found in reform-minded cities, with mixed socioeconomic composition. Officers are expected to generate a large number of arrests and citations and act as if there were a single community standard for conduct, rather than different standards for different groups. However, the fact that certain groups are more likely to have law enforcement contact means this strict enforcement of laws may seem overly harsh on certain groups; *Service ::Emphasizes the service functions of police work, usually found in suburban, middle-class communities where residents demand individual treatment. Police in homogeneous communities can view their work as protecting their citizens against \\"outsiders\\", with frequent but often-informal interventions against community members. The uniform make-up of the community means crimes are usually more obvious, and therefore less frequent, leaving police free to deal with service functions and traffic control. Wilson's study applies to police behavior for the entire department over time. At any given time, police officers may be acting in a watchman, service, or legalistic function by the nature of what they are doing at the time, their temperament, or their mood at the time. Individual officers may also be inclined to one style or another, regardless of the supervisor or citizen demands. Community- oriented policing is a shift in policing practices in the U.S. that moved away from standardization and towards a more preventative model where police actively partner with the community it serves. History Grover Cleveland was Sheriff of Erie County New York in 1871‚Äì1872 Theodore Roosevelt as Police Commissioner of New York City with Jacob Riis 1894 San Francisco Police Department officer in 1936. =Early colonial policing= Policing in what would become the United States of America arose from the law enforcement systems in European countries, particularly the ancient English common law system. This relied heavily on citizen volunteers, as well as watch groups, constables, sheriffs, and a conscription system known as posse comitatus similar to the militia system. An early night watch formed in Boston in 1631, and in 1634 the first U.S. constable on record was Joshua Pratt, in the Plymouth Colony.http://what-when-how.com/police-science/constables-police/ Constables were tasked with surveying land, serving warrants, and enforcing punishments. A rattlewatch was formed in New Amsterdam, later to become New York City, in 1651. The New York rattlewatch \\"strolled the streets to discourage crime and search for lawbreakers\\" and also served as town criers. In 1658, they began drawing pay, making them the first municipally funded police organization. When the British took New Amsterdam in 1664, they installed an English constable whose duties included keeping the peace, suppressing excessive drinking, gambling, prostitution, and preventing disturbances during church services. A night watch was formed in Philadelphia in 1700. In the Southern colonies, formal slave patrols were created as early as 1704 in the Carolina colonies in order to prevent slave rebellions and enslaved people from escaping. By 1785 the Charleston Guard and Watch had \\"a distinct chain of command, uniforms, sole responsibility for policing, salary, authorized use of force, and a focus on preventing 'crime'.\\" =Development of modern policing= Modern policing began to emerge in the U.S. in the mid- nineteenth century, influenced by the British model of policing established in 1829. The first organized publicly-funded professional full-time police services were established in Boston in 1838,\\"How the U.S. Got Its Police Force\\", Time, Olivia Waxman, May 18, 2017. New York in 1844, and Philadelphia in 1854. Early on, police were not respected by the community, as corruption was rampant. Slave patrols in the south were abolished upon the abolition of slavery in the 1860s. The vigilante tactics of the slave patrols are reflected in the tactics of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist group established after the abolition of slavery. Various tactics also carried over into the practices of policing following abolition, including practices of surveillance and curfew enforcement. In the late 19th and early 20th century, there were few specialized units in police departments. In 1905, the Pennsylvania State Police became the first state police agency established in the United States, as recommended by President Theodore Roosevelt's Anthracite Strike Commission and Governor Samuel Pennypacker. The advent of the police car, two-way radio, and telephone in the early 20th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to calls for service. In the 1920s, led by Berkeley, California police chief, August Vollmer, police began to professionalize, adopt new technologies, and place emphasis on training. With this transformation, police command and control became more centralized. O.W. Wilson, a student of Vollmer, helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita, Kansas, and later in the Chicago Police Department. Strategies employed by O.W. Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption, establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force, a strict merit system for promotions within the department, and an aggressive, recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers. Despite such reforms, police agencies were led by highly autocratic leaders, and there remained a lack of respect between police and the community. During the professionalism era of policing, law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime, rather than focusing on crime prevention. Following urban unrest in the 1960s, police placed more emphasis on community relations, and enacted reforms such as increased diversity in hiring. The Kansas City Preventive Patrol study in the 1970s found the reactive approach to policing to be ineffective. The cost of policing rapidly expanded during the 1960s. In 1951, American cities spent $82 per person on policing. Adjusting for inflation, police spending increased over 300% by 2016, to $286 per person. In the 1990s, many law enforcement agencies began to adopt community policing strategies, and others adopted problem-oriented policing. In the 1990s, CompStat was developed by the New York Police Department as an information-based system for tracking and mapping crime patterns and trends, and holding police accountable for dealing with crime problems. CompStat, and other forms of information-led policing, have since been replicated in police departments across the United States. Powers of officers Law enforcement officers are granted certain powers to enable them to carry out their duties. When there exists probable cause to believe that a person has committed a serious crime, a law enforcement officer can handcuff and arrest a person, who will be held in a police station or jail pending a judicial bail determination or an arraignment. In 2010, the FBI estimated that law enforcement agencies made 13,120,947 arrests (excluding traffic violations). Of those persons arrested, 74.5% were male and 69.4 percent of all persons arrested were white, 28.0 percent were black, and the remaining 2.6 percent were of other races.FBI Uniform Crime Reports A law enforcement officer may briefly detain a person upon reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime but short of probable cause to arrest. Contrary to popular belief and Hollywood-style depictions in TV and movies, merely lawfully detaining a person‚Äîin and of itself‚Äîdoes not deprive a person of their Fourth Amendment right against unlawful searches. Federal, state, and local laws, and individual law enforcement departmental policies govern when, where, how, and upon whom a law enforcement officer may perform a \\"pat down,\\" \\"protective search,\\" or \\"Terry frisk,\\" based on several U.S. Supreme Court decisions (including Terry v. Ohio (1968), Michigan v. Long (1983), and Maryland v. Buie (1990)): In Terry v. Ohio, the landmark decision introducing the term \\"Terry frisk\\", or \\"frisk\\", to the broader public (italics added): > Our evaluation of the proper balance that has to be struck in this type of > case leads us to conclude that there must be a narrowly drawn authority to > permit a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police > officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and > dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest > the individual for a crime. The officer need not be absolutely certain that > the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in > the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that > of others was in danger.  Controversies  = Deadly force and death in custody = In most states, law enforcement officers operate under the same self-defense laws as the civilians of these states. Generally, when the first responder or a member of the public is at risk of serious bodily injury and/or death, lethal force is justified. Most law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum and list deadly force as a force of last resort. With this model, agencies try to control excessive uses of force. Nonetheless, some question the number of killings by law enforcement officers, including killings of people who are unarmed, raising questions about alleged widespread and ongoing excessive use of force. Other non-fatal incidents and arrests have raised similar concerns... The racial distribution of victims of US police lethal force is not proportionate to the racial distribution of the US population. Whites account for the largest racial group of deaths, but are under-represented, accounting for 45% of police killings (and 60% of the population). Blacks are over-represented, accounting for 24% of police killings (and 13% of the population). Hispanics are proportionately represented, accounting for 17% of police killings (and 18% of the population). Others (including Asian, Native American, and others) are under-represented, accounting for 4% of police killings (and 8% of the population).Paull, John (2019). The Use of Lethal Force by Police in the USA: Mortality Metrics of Race and Disintegration (2015-2019), Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 5 (4): 30-35 =Militarization of police= The militarization of both rural and urban law enforcement has been attributed to the United States' involvement in wars during the 20th century, although some attribute the militarization to the more recent campaigns on drugs and terror.Gregory, Anthony. \\"Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces.\\" The Independent Review 19.2 (2014): 271-75.

October 25, 2014. Historian Charles Beard argues that cultural change during the Great Depression encouraged the militarization of law enforcement,Kohn, Richard H. \\"The Danger of Militarization in an Endless \\"War\\" on Terrorism.\\" The Journal of Military History 73.1 (2008): 177-208.ProQuest Research Library. Web. October 25, 2014. whereas Harwood argues that the creation of SWAT teams and tactical units within law enforcement during the 1960s began such a trend. In recent years, the use of military equipment and tactics for community policing and for public order policing has become more widespread under the 1033 program. The program prompted discussion among lawmakers in 2014 after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. President Obama introduced restrictions in 2015 on the transfer of surplus military equipment to police. In 2017, the Trump administration announced it will reinstate the program. = Qualified immunity = The U.S. Supreme Court first introduced the qualified immunity doctrine in 1967, originally with the rationale of protecting law enforcement officials from frivolous lawsuits and financial liability in cases where they acted in good faith in unclear legal situations. Starting around 2005, courts increasingly applied the doctrine to cases involving the use of excessive or deadly force by police, leading to widespread criticism that it, in the words of a 2020 Reuters report, \\"has become a nearly failsafe tool to let police brutality go unpunished and deny victims their constitutional rights\\". =Civil asset forfeiture= Rules on civil asset forfeiture allow law enforcement officers to seize anything which they can plausibly claim was the proceeds of a crime. The property-owner need not be convicted of that crime; if officers find drugs in a house, they can take cash from the house and possibly the house itself. Commentators have said these rules provide an incentive for law enforcement officers to focus on drug-related crimes rather than crimes against persons, such as rape and homicide. They also provide an incentive to arrest suspected drug-dealers inside their houses, which can be seized, and to raid stash houses after most of their drugs have been sold, when officers can seize the cash. = Misconducts = Over the past decades, police departments across the country have been affected by instances of misconduct and brutality. Some prominent examples include the following: * 1960s: The Sixties was the height of the Civil Rights Movement and much police misconduct came from protests that often turned violent. There were also planned attacks against police stemming directly from the force that was being used by the police, against the protesters. President Lyndon Johnson created the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance in 1965. From that, much was done on the federal and local level, such as enhanced training for police personnel. Police officers at that time were often made up of ex-military members that had little training and were left to learn their skills during their job experiences. Law enforcement personnel were also responsible to attend college as a result. * 1965: The Watts Riots of 1965 lasted six days and began following the arrest of Marquette Frye by a white California Highway Patrol officer on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. 34 people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured. The riots also caused over $40 million in damage. * 1985: On May 13, 1985, nearly five hundred police officers attempted to clear the MOVE black liberation group compound in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After a shootout between police and MOVE members involving automatic weapons and over 10,000 rounds fired, Commissioner Gregore Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed. Two one-pound bombs made of FBI-supplied Tovex, were dropped from a police helicopter targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house. The resulting explosions ignited a fire from fuel for a gasoline- powered generator stored in the rooftop bunker. The fire spread and eventually destroyed approximately sixty-five nearby houses. Eleven people including five children aged 7 to 13 died in the resulting fire. * 1991: In March 1991, Officers from the Los Angeles Police Department, while attempting to arrest Rodney King, used what many believed was excessive force. Four LAPD officers used physical force on King after he resisted arrest. A bystander videotaped the incident and later supplied it to local media. The officers were charged with assault and using excessive force, with all officers acquitted of the assault, and three of the four officers acquitted of using excessive use of force, during the initial trial. This led to the citywide 1992 Los Angeles riots, during which 63 people were killed and 2,373 were injured; it ended only after the California Army National Guard, the United States Army, and the United States Marine Corps provided reinforcements to re-establish control. * 2006: In 2006, Sean Bell was fatally shot on the night before his wedding. It was reported that the police had shot over 50 times at Bell and two of his friends that he was with. * 2014: In 2014, Michael Brown was shot by a police officer after struggling with the officer and attempting to take the officer's gun. His death prompted citywide riots and protests that lasted approximately 5 days. * 2016: In 2016, Philando Castile was shot by a police officer. Due to the rise of social media and cell phones, it is now easy for people to broadcast police use of force incidents that they see. The trend started with Rodney King and has grown since. In this case, Castile's girlfriend live- streamed his death on Facebook. The video gained approximately 3.2 million views by the next day. * 2020: In 2020, George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis Police Department officer in an arrest filmed and uploaded on social media. Despite pleas from bystanders for the officer to remove his knee from his neck and Floyd verbally stating he couldn't breathe, the officer did not move, and Floyd died due to injuries sustained in the incident. The incident has sparked ongoing protests and riots across the United States. =Issues with recruitment= Despite safeguards around recruitment, some police departments have at times relaxed hiring and staffing policies, sometimes in violation of the law, most often in the cases of local departments and federally funded drug task forces facing staffing shortages, attrition, and needs to quickly fill positions. This has included at times the fielding (and sometimes the arming) of uncertified officers (who may be working temporarily in what is supposed to be a provisional limited-duty status prior to certification) and the hiring of itinerant \\"gypsy cops\\", who may have histories of poor performance or misconduct in other departments. = Other concerns = The procedural use of strip searches and cavity searches by law enforcement has raised civil liberties concerns. The practice of taking an arrested person on a perp walk, often handcuffed, through a public place at some point after the arrest, creating an opportunity for the media to take photographs and video of the event, has also raised concerns. The New York City Police Department came under scrutiny in 2012 for its use of a stop-and- frisk program.  Accountability  Special commissions, such as the Knapp Commission in New York City during the 1970s, have been used to bring about changes in law enforcement agencies. Civilian review boards (permanent external oversight agencies) have also been used as a means for improving police accountability. Civilian review boards tend to focus on individual complaints, rather than broader organizational issues that may result in long- term improvements. The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act authorized the United States Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division to bring civil (\\"pattern or practice\\") suits against local law enforcement agencies, to reign in abuses and hold them accountable. As a result, numerous departments have entered into consent decrees or memoranda of understanding, requiring them to make organizational reforms. This approach shifts focus from individual officers to placing focus on police organizations. Police reform There have been many initiatives for police reform in the United States, notably since the 1960s, under President Lyndon Johnson, and several more recent efforts. In the 21st century, reforms based on community dialogue, legal requirements and updating of police training are growing. Nonetheless, instances of misconduct and brutality have continued to occur. Many reforms related to the killing of George Floyd have been put forward.  Calls for abolition  \\"Abolish the police\\" graffiti in Minneapolis, MN (June 2020) While police resentment and calls for abolition of the police have existed in the United States for over a century, police abolition became more popular in 2014 following the killing of Michael Brown and the Ferguson unrest, with national attention being drawn to issues surrounding policing. The roots of police abolition stem from (and is often linked to) the prison abolition movement. Authors and activists such as Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore, who are best known for their prison abolition work, have integrated police abolition into their work when advocating against the carceral system of the United States. In the summer of 2016, Chicago had a multitude of abolitionist actions and protests in response to the deaths of Michael Brown and Paul O'Neal, among others. This included the occupation of an empty lot across from a Chicago Police Department property, naming it \\"Freedom Square\\", as an experiment of a world without police. In 2017, sociologist Alex S. Vitale authored The End of Policing, calling for police abolition as opposed to reforms. Police abolition spiked in popularity following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin. A super-majority of the Minneapolis City Council (9 of 12 council members) pledged in June 2020 to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. Entry qualifications Nearly all U.S. states and the federal government have by law adopted minimum- standard standardized training requirements for all officers with powers of arrest within the state. Many standards apply to in-service training as well as entry-level training, particularly in the use of firearms, with periodic re-certification required. These standards often comply with standards promoted by the US Department of Justice and typically require a thorough background check that potential police recruits must take. A typical set of criteria dictates that they must: * Be a United States citizen (waived in certain agencies if the applicant is a lawful resident). * Have a high school diploma or a GED and if necessary a college degree or served in the United States military without a dishonorable discharge; * Be in good medical, physical, and psychological condition; * Maintain a clean criminal record without either serious or repeated misdemeanor or any felony convictions; * Have a valid driver's license that is not currently nor has a history of being suspended or revoked; * Be of high moral character; * Not have a history of prior narcotic or repeated marijuana use or alcoholism; * Not have a history of ethical, professional, prior employment, motor vehicle, educational, or financial improprieties; * Not have a history of domestic violence or mental illness; * Not pose a safety and security risk; * Be legally eligible to own and carry a firearm. Repeated interviews, written tests, medical examinations, physical fitness tests, comprehensive background investigations, fingerprinting, drug testing, a police oral board interview, a polygraph examination, and a consultation with a psychologist are common practices used to review the suitability of candidates. Recruiting in most departments is competitive, with more suitable and desirable candidates accepted over lesser ones, and failure to meet some minimum standards disqualifying a candidate entirely. Police oral boards are the most subjective part of the process and often disqualifies the biggest portion of qualified candidates.The Law Enforcement Oral Board Interview Departments maintain records of past applicants under review, and refer to them in the case of either reapplication or requests between other agencies. Police equipment =Firearms= Police in the United States usually carry a handgun on duty. Many are required to be armed off-duty and often required to have a concealable off-duty handgun. Among the most common sidearms are models produced by Glock, Smith & Wesson, SIG Sauer, Beretta, and Heckler & Koch, usually in 9mm, .40 S&W;, .357 SIG (US Secret Service and other Federal Law Enforcement agencies) or .45 ACP. Until the late 1980s and early 1990s, most US police officers carried revolvers, typically in .38 Special or .357 Magnum calibers, as their primary duty weapons. At the time, Smith & Wesson, Colt, Ruger and some Taurus models were popular with police officers, most popular being the Smith & Wesson or Colt revolvers. Since then, most agencies have switched to semiautomatic pistols. Two key events influencing many US police forces to upgrade their primary duty weapons to weapons with greater stopping power and round capacity were the 1980 Norco shootout and the 1986 FBI Miami shootout. Some police departments allow qualified officers to carry shotguns and/or semiautomatic rifles in their vehicles for additional firepower, typically to be used if a suspect is involved in an active shooter situation, or a hostage/barricade incident. =Less lethal weapons= ASP 21‚Ä≥ tactical baton in collapsed and expanded states. Police also often carry an impact weapon‚Äîa baton, also known as a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been replaced in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock Expandable Baton or ASP baton. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while still wearing the baton on their duty belt. The side handle nightstick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use less-lethal weapons such as mace, pepper spray, and beanbag shotgun rounds. Another less lethal weapon that police officers often carry is an electroshock guns, also known as a taser. The handheld electroshock weapon was designed to incapacitate a single person from a distance by using electric current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles. Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in Drive Stun mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons. =Specialized weapons= Most large police departments have elite SWAT units which are called in to handle situations such as barricaded suspects, hostage situations and high-risk warrant service that require greater force, specialized equipment, and special tactics. These units usually have submachine guns, automatic carbines or rifles, semiautomatic combat shotguns, sniper rifles, gas, smoke, and flashbang grenades, and other specialized weapons and equipment at their disposal. Some departments are equipped with armored vehicles. =Body armor= Uniformed police officers often wear body armor, typically in the form of a lightweight Level IIA, II or IIIA vest that can be worn under service shirts. SWAT teams typically wear heavier Level III or IV tactical armored vests, often with steel or ceramic trauma plates, comparable to those worn by U.S. military personnel engaged in ground operations. Officers trained in bomb disposal wear specialized heavy protective armor designed to protect them from the effects of an explosion when working around live ordnance. Local police foundations have initiated programs to provide law enforcement agencies with higher level vests that provide greater protection and vests for police K-9s as well. = Body-worn camera = Multiple states have pending body-worn camera legislation that requires its law enforcement to be equipped with body- worn cameras when the officers are on duty. Some of these states include California, Washington, and Illinois, among others. Body-worn cameras are video recording devices around three inches long that cost between $129-$900. There are different body-worn camera models, but a standard body-worn camera includes an on and off switch that enables the image capturing technology to record and store data in the cloud. Body-worn cameras have become standard due to the rise of civilian complaints about police brutality across the nation. Supporters argue that the use of a body-worn camera allows evidence to be viewed from an unbiased perspective. Corporations are currently working on body-worn camera models that will resolve the technology's limitations such as better audio capturing technology and battery life, to name a few. = Drones= In recent years police have recruited unmanned surveillance devices such as small throwable robotics and flying drones to conduct reconnaissance in dangerous locations. These devices can be used to identify the presence of a hostage, locate and/or identify subjects, and reveal the layout of a room. The devices do all this by transmitting real-time audio and video to the pilot, giving police an advantage when they cannot directly see a suspect or enter a location where they are needed. Some other uses for this device may be bomb detection, as well as searching suspicious vehicles. Flying drones are also being enlisted to help police in dangerous situations such as a barricaded suspect or a hostage situation. These drones increase safety by providing information that can be used in mapping and planning. These devices equipped with cameras allow officers to get a bird's eye view of a scene in an emergency, allowing responders to safely get much closer to a scene than they could if they went in on foot.  Police communications  = Radio = Most American police departments are dispatched from a centralized communications center, using VHF, UHF, or, more recently, digitally trunked radio transceivers mounted in their vehicles, with individual officers carrying portable handsets or ear-worn headsets for communication when away from their vehicles. American police cars are also increasingly equipped with mobile data terminals (MDTs) or portable computers linked by radio to a network allowing them access to state department of motor vehicles information, criminal records, and other important information. Most police communications are now conducted within a regional pool of area telecommunicators or dispatchers using 9-1-1 and 9-1-1 telephone taxation. A large number of police agencies have pooled their 9-1-1 tax resources for Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD) to streamline dispatching and reporting. CAD systems are usually linked to MDTs (see above). = National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System = A variety of national, regional, state, and local information systems are available to law enforcement agencies in the U.S., with different purposes and types of information. One example is the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS), an interstate justice and public safety network owned by the states supporting inquiry into state systems for criminal history, driver's license and motor vehicle registration, as well as supporting inquiry into federal systems, such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Law Enforcement Support Center, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) National Drug Pointer Index (NDPIX), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Registry and the Government of Canada's Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). NLETS operates primarily through a secure private network through which each state has an interface to the network that all agencies within the state operate through. The federal and international components operate very similarly. Users include all U.S. states and territories, some federal agencies, and certain international agencies. The primary operational site for the network is housed in Arizona, with a secure backup site located in the East Central U.S. Through the NLETS network, law enforcement and criminal justice agencies can access a wide range of information, from standard driver license and vehicle queries to criminal history and Interpol information. Operations consist of nearly 1.5 billion transactions a year to over one million PC, mobile, and handheld devices in the U.S. and Canada at 45,000 user agencies, and to 1.3 million individual users. = Dissemination = Police departments share arrest information with third-party news organizations that archive names of citizens and legal allegations in a \\"police blotter\\". However, even if the allegations are dismissed in court, a citizen may not petition the third-party for removal.  Police population  In 2008, federal police employed approximately 120,000 full-time law enforcement officers, authorized to make arrests and carry firearms in the United States. U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics. The 2012 Bureau of Justice Statistics' Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA), found there were 17,985 state and local law enforcement agencies employing at least one full-time officer or the equivalent in part- time officers. In 2008, state and local law enforcement agencies employed more than 1.1 million people on a full-time basis, including about 765,000 sworn personnel (defined as those with general arrest powers). Agencies also employed approximately 100,000 part-time employees, including 44,000 sworn officers. From 2004 to 2008, overall full-time employment by state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide increased by about 57,000 (or 5.3%). Sworn personnel increased by about 33,000 (4.6%), and nonsworn employees by about 24,000 (6.9%). From 2004 to 2008, the number of full-time sworn personnel per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 250 to 251. From 1992 to 2008, the growth rate for civilian personnel was more than double that of sworn personnel. Local police departments were the largest employer of sworn personnel, accounting for 60% of the total. Sheriffs' offices were next, accounting for 24%. About half (49%) of all agencies employed fewer than 10 full-time officers. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of sworn personnel worked for agencies that employed 100 or more officers. = Demographics = Law enforcement has historically been a male-dominated profession. Approximately 18,000 law enforcement agencies make up the country ranging from federal, state, and local police with more than 1.1 million people employed. There are around 12,000 local law enforcement agencies, the biggest out of the three types. In the most recent of surveys done in 2013, the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics found that 72.8% of local police officers are white. Black or African American are 12.2% (the black population in the United States is roughly 13%) and Latino or Hispanic are 11.6%. Women made up 17% of full-time sworn in officers. While black or African Americans are not significantly under-represented in police forces, women, Asian, and Hispanic officers are lacking. Many police agencies are attempting to hire more diverse recruits in an effort to better represent their communities. = Changes in personnel numbers = Fifteen of the 50 largest local police departments employed fewer full-time sworn personnel in 2008 than in 2004. The largest declines were in Detroit (36%), Memphis (23%), New Orleans (13%), and San Francisco (10%). Ten of the 50 largest local police departments reported double-digit increases in sworn personnel from 2004 to 2008. The largest increases were in Phoenix (19%), Prince George's County (Maryland) (17%), Dallas (15%), and Fort Worth (14%). = Salary = Salary varies widely for police officers, with most being among the top third of wage-earners, age 25 or older, nationwide. The median annual wage for police and detectives was $65,170 in May 2019. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $37,710, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $109,620. The median wages for police and detective occupations in May 2019 were as follows: * $83,170 for detectives and criminal investigators * $71,820 for police and sheriff's patrol officers * $63,150 for transit and railroad police * $57,500 for fish and game wardens = Deaths = The majority of officers who die on the job are the result of accidents rather than homicides. Civilians face a homicide rate of 5.6 per 100,000, while police face a homicide rate of 3 per 100,000. The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc., (ODMP) has tracked approximately 24,000 officers who have died in the line of duty in the United States since 1786. As of May 4, 2020, sixteen officers died as a result of contracting coronavirus (COVID-19) in the line of duty.

It was founded in 1409 when Louis II of Anjou, Count of Provence, petitioned the Pisan Antipope Alexander V to establish the University of Provence.C. D. O'Malley, The History of Medical Education: UCLA Forum in Medical Sciences, University of California Press, 1970, p. 125 The university as it is today was formed by the merger of the University of Provence, the University of the Mediterranean and Paul C√©zanne University. The merger became effective on 1 January 2012, resulting in the creation of the largest university in the French-speaking world, with about 80,000 students.Aix-Marseille Universit√© (AMU) ‚Äì UnILiON AMU has the largest budget of any academic institution in the Francophone world, standing at ‚Ç¨750 million. The university is organized around five main campuses situated in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille. Apart from its major campuses, AMU owns and operates facilities in Arles, Aubagne, Avignon, Digne-les-Bains, Gap, La Ciotat, Lambesc and Salon-de-Provence. The university is headquartered at the Pharo, Marseille. AMU has produced many notable alumni in the fields of law, politics, business, science, academia, and arts. To date, there have been four Nobel Prize laureates amongst its alumni and faculty, as well as a two-time recipient of the Pulitzer Prize, four C√©sar Award winners, multiple heads of state or government, parliamentary speakers, government ministers, ambassadors and members of the constituent academies of the Institut de France. AMU has hundreds of research and teaching partnerships, including close collaboration with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). AMU is a member of numerous academic organisations including the European University Association (EUA) and the Mediterranean Universities Union (UNIMED).Mediterranean Universities Union (UNIMED)  History  =Early history (1409‚Äì1800)= Louis II of Anjou, Count of Provence, the university's founder, as painted by Barth√©lemy d'Eyck and now on display at the National Library of France The institution developed out of the original University of Provence, founded on 9 December 1409 as a studium generale by Louis II of Anjou, Count of Provence, and recognized by papal bull issued by the Pisan Antipope Alexander V.1409‚Äì2009 \\"Une Universit√©, une ville, une histoire\\" However, there is evidence that teaching in Aix existed in some form from the beginning of the 12th century, since there were a doctor of theology in 1100, a doctor of law in 1200 and a professor of law in 1320 on the books. The decision to establish the university was, in part, a response to the already-thriving University of Paris.Darwin Porter, Frommer's Provence & the Riviera, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2010, p. 20 As a result, in order to be sure of the viability of the new institution, Louis II compelled his Proven√ßal students to study in Aix only.Walter R√ºegg, Hilde de Ridder-Symoens, A History of the University in Europe, Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 105 Thus, the letters patent for the university were granted, and the government of the university was created. The Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence, Thomas de Puppio, was appointed as the first chancellor of the university for the rest of his life. After his death in 1420, a new chancellor was elected by the rector, masters, and licentiates ‚Äì an uncommon arrangement not repeated at any other French university. The rector was to be an \\"ordinary student\\", who had unrestricted civil and criminal jurisdiction in all cases where one party was a doctor or scholar of the university. Those displeased with the rector's decisions could appeal to a doctor legens. Eleven consiliarii provided assistance to the rector, being elected yearly by their predecessors. These individuals represented all faculties, but were elected from among the students. The constitution was of a student-university, and the instructors did not have great authority except in granting degrees.Carol Summerfield, Mary Elizabeth Devine, International Dictionary of University Histories, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1998, p. 418 A resident doctor or student who married was required to pay charivari to the university, the amount varying with the degree or status of the man, and being increased if the bride was a widow. Refusal to submit to this statutable extortion was punished by the assemblage of students at the summons of the rector with frying-pans, bassoons, and horns at the house of the newly married couple. Continued recusancy was followed by the piling up of dirt in front of their door upon every Feast-day. These injunctions were justified on the ground that the money extorted was devoted to divine service.Hastings Rashdall, The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, Volume 2 ‚Äì Part 2, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 648 In 1486 Provence passed to the French crown.M. Malte-Brun, A system of universal geography, or a description of all the parts of the world, on a new plan, according to the great natural divisions of the globe, Boston, 1834, Vol. III, p. 1022 The university's continued existence was approved by Louis XII of France, and Aix-en-Provence continued to be a significant provincial centre. It was, for instance, the seat of the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence from 1501 to 1789,\\"The Encyclopedia Americana\\", Volume 1, Grolier Incorporated, 2001, p. 432Martin Garrett, \\"Provence: A Cultural History\\", Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 103 no doubt aided by the presence of the law school. In 1603 Henry IV of France established the Coll√®ge Royal de Bourbon in Aix-en-Provence for the study of belles-lettres and philosophy,William Darrach Halsey, Emanuel Friedman, \\"Collier's Encyclopedia\\", Macmillan Educational Co., 1983, p. 412 supplementing the traditional faculties of the university, but not formally a part of it. This college de plain exercice became a significant seat of learning, under the control of the Jesuit order. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, the college frequently served as a preparatory, but unaffiliated, school for the university. Only the university was entitled to award degrees in the theology, law, and medicine; but candidates for degrees had first to pass an examination in philosophy, which was only provided by the college. Universities basically accepted candidates who had studied in colleges formally affiliated with them, which in reality required both college and university to be situated in the same city. In 1762 the Jesuits were forced to leave France, and in 1763 the Coll√®ge Royal de Bourbon was officially affiliated with the university as a faculty of arts.Walter R√ºegg, Hilde De Ridder-Symoens, A History of the University in Europe, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 87 The addition of the Coll√®ge Royal de Bourbon essentially widened the scope of courses provided at the University of Provence. Formal instruction in French was initially provided at the college, with texts and a structured course of study. Subsequently, physics became a part of the curriculum at the college as a part of the philosophy course in the 18th century. Equipment for carrying out experiments was obtained and the first course in experimental physics was provided at Aix-en-Provence in 1741. Classical mechanics, nevertheless, was merely taught after 1755, when the physicist Paulian offered his first class and Isaac Newton's Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica and commentaries were obtained for the library. The French Revolution, with its focus on the individual and an end to inherited privilege, saw the suppression of the universities. To the revolutionaries, universities embodied bastions of corporatism and established interests. Moreover, lands owned by the universities and utilized for their support, represented a source of wealth to be tapped by the revolutionary government, just as property possessed by the Church had been confiscated. In 1792, the University of Provence, along with twenty-one other universities, was dissolved.Thomas Neville Bonner, Becoming a Physician: Medical Education in Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, 1750‚Äì1945, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000, p. 94 Specialized ecoles, with rigorous entrance examinations and open to anyone with talent, were eventually created in order to offer professional training in specialized areas. Nonetheless, the government found it necessary to allow the faculties of law and medicine to continue in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille in the early 19th century. =Modern era (1800‚Äì1968)= During the 19th century, additional faculties were created in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille to serve the changing needs of French society. For instance, Hippolyte Fortoul, later Minister of National Education and Public Worship of France, was the first dean and professor of a new faculty in French literature established in Aix-en-Provence in the 1840s.Michael Glencross, Reconstructing Camelot: French Romantic Medievalism and the Arthurian Tradition, St Edmundsbury Press Ltd, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, 1995, p. 85Joseph N. Moody, French Education since Napoleon, Syracuse University Press, 1978, p. 59 In 1896, the departmental council of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne founded a chair in the faculty of letters at Aix-en-Provence in the language and literature of Southern Europe; their aim was to assist the commercial exploitation of the region by French business. A new science faculty was created in Marseille to support the growing industrialization of the region. At about the same time, a special training program was created in the faculty of medicine in order to train doctors in colonial medicine for France's expanding colonial empire. The most significant development for the university in the 19th century, nevertheless, was the recreation of French universities in 1896.Fritz Ringer, Toward a Social History of Knowledge: Collected Essays, Berghahn Books, 2000, p. 84 The various faculties in Aix-en- Provence and Marseille were grouped into the new University of Aix- Marseille.Paul Monroe, A Cyclopedia of Education, A-CHR, Vol. 1 of 4, Forgotten Books, 2012, p. 70 Through two world wars and a depression, the University of Aix-Marseille continued to develop. Increasing numbers of women and foreign students joined the student body, and an overwhelming majority of students majored in the science, medicine, and law. Individual faculties were almost autonomous from university administration and the Ministry of Education frequently intervened directly among the faculties. =Recent history (1968‚Äìpresent)= Former seat of the University of the Mediterranean Aix- Marseille II Following riots among university students in May 1968, a reform of French education occurred. The Orientation Act (Loi d'Orientation de l'Enseignement Superieur) of 1968 divided the old faculties into smaller subject departments, decreased the power of the Ministry of Education, and created smaller universities, with strengthened administrations. Subsequently, the University of Aix-Marseille was divided into two institutions. Each university had different areas of concentration of study and the faculties were divided as follows: * University of Aix-Marseille I: law, political science, history, psychology, sociology, ethnology, philosophy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, languages, literature and civilization * University of Aix-Marseille II: economic science, geography, technology, medicine, pharmacy, dental surgery, topical medicine, physical education and ocean scienceCarol Summerfield, Mary Elizabeth Devine, International Dictionary of University Histories, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1998, p. 419 In 1973, conservative faculty members led by Charles Debbasch, demanded and obtained the creation of the University of Aix-Marseille III, grouping law, political science, applied economics, earth science, ecology and technological studies. Nearly 40 years later, in June 2007, the three universities of Aix- Marseille expressed their intention to merge in order to form one university. The merger was gradually prepared, respecting a schedule which allowed for long discussions at each stage, after which it was approved by vote of the Board of Directors of each university. Thus, Aix-Marseille University was established by decree No. 2011‚Äì1010 of 24 August 2011 and officially opened its doors on 1 January 2012. Academic profile The headquarters for AMU is located at the Pharo, Marseille H√¥tel Maynier d'Opp√®de, built 1757, former home of the IEFEE Aix-Marseille University enrolls about 80,000 students, including more than 10,000 international students from 128 different countries. The university, with its wide range of general and vocational courses including 600 degree courses, offers teaching in fields as varied as the Arts, Social Sciences, Health, Sport and Economics, Law and Political Sciences, Applied Economics and Management, and Exact Sciences such as Mathematics, Data-processing, Physical Sciences, Astrophysical Sciences, Chemistry and Biology. Its 132 recognized research units and 21 faculties make it a centre of international excellence in social and natural sciences. With more than 500 international agreements, the university participates in the creation of European area of education and research and in the development of mobility. A policy in the direction of Asian countries has led to increase its enrollments of excellent international students. Programmes in French and/or English have been organized in order to favour the welcome and the integration of international students, in particular thanks to the presence within the university of the Institute of French Studies for Foreign Students (Institut d'Etudes Fran√ßaises Pour Etudiants Etrangers (IEFEE)). The IEFEE was founded in 1953 and is regarded as one of the best French-language teaching centres in the country. About a thousand students from 65 countries attend the institute throughout the academic year. The institute is also a notable centre for teachers of French as a foreign language, and its function is to provide training and perfecting of linguistic abilities in French as a scientific and cultural means of communication. Furthermore, the university is \\"one of the most distinguished in France, second only to the University of Paris in the areas of French literature, history, and linguistics\\", according to Harvard University's website. The university's library system comprises 59 libraries, with 662,000 volumes, 20,000 online periodical titles, and thousands of digital resources, making it one of the largest and most diverse academic library systems in France. The overall area occupied by the libraries is equal to 37,056 m2, including 19,703 m2 public access space. The libraries offer 49.2 kilometers of open-stacks shelving and 4,219 seats for student study. In addition, there are 487 computer workstations, which are available to the public for research purposes. =Political Science= Sciences Po Aix is housed in the Palais de l'universit√©, a monument historique built in 1734, designed by Georges Vallon The main entrance to Sciences Po Aix The university's Institute of Political Studies (Institut d'√©tudes politiques d'Aix-en-Provence), also known as Sciences Po Aix, was established in 1956. The institute is housed in the Palais de l'universit√©, a monument historique designed by architect Georges Vallon in 1734. It is one of a network of 10 world-famous IEPs (Instituts d'Etudes Politiques) in France, including those in Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Paris, Rennes, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Strasbourg and Toulouse. Sciences Po Aix is a Grande √©cole in political science and its primary aim is to train senior executives for the public, semi-public, and private sectors. Although the institute offers a multitude of disciplines, its main focus is on politics, including related subjects such as history, law, economics, languages, international relations, and media studies. Its admissions process is among the toughest and most selective in the country. Sciences Po Aix has numerous exchange programs through partnerships with about 120 different universities in the world: the school therefore welcomes 200 foreign students a year. On top of these academic exchanges, students have the opportunity to do internships abroad in large international firms. Many of the institute's graduates have gone on to high positions within both the French government and in foreign governments. Among the best-known people who studied at Sciences Po Aix are the current President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, former High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice- President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini, the 5th President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Kumaratunga, former Minister of Justice of France, √âlisabeth Guigou, former Presidents of the National Assembly of France, Philippe S√©guin and Patrick Ollier. =Law= Faculty of Law and Political Science, built 1953, designed by Fernand Pouillon Paul C√©zanne, for whom the University of Aix-Marseille III was named, attended the law school from 1858 to 1861 The law school at AMU dates back to the university's foundation in 1409.LA FACULTE DE DROIT D‚ÄôAIX-EN-PROVENCE: UNE HISTOIRE, UN PATRIMOINE The school had far-reaching influence, since written law, which in France originated in Aix-en-Provence, spread from there, eventually replacing the common law practiced throughout the rest of Northern Gaul.Ferne Arfin, \\"Adventure Guide to Provence & the C√¥te d'Azur\\", Hunter Publishing Inc, 2009, p. 149 The law school has a long tradition of self-management, with a strongly institutionalized culture and practices enrooted in the social and economic realities of the region.Francesco Longo, Daniela Cristofoli, \\"Strategic Change Management in the Public Sector\\", John Wiley & Sons, 2007, p. 83 Today, it is one of the largest law schools in France, and is considered to be one of the nation's leading centres for legal research and teaching. The school is unique among French law schools for the breadth of courses offered and the extent of research undertaken in a wide range of fields. For 2019/20, the law school is ranked 3rd nationally for its undergraduate studies by Eduniversal. \\"Other than the Sorbonne, Aix has attracted the most prestigious law faculty in France\\", according to the University of Connecticut's website. The teaching faculty comprises 155 professors and 172 adjunct lecturers, the latter drawn from private practice, the civil service, the judiciary and other organizations. Much of the legal research at the university is done under the auspices of its many research institutes ‚Äì there is one in almost every field of law. Research activity is buttressed by a network of libraries, which holds an impressive collection of monographs and periodicals, including an important collection of 16th-century manuscripts. Moreover, the libraries have several specialized rooms dedicated to specific fields of law, in particular in International and European Law and Legal Theory. The school has produced a large number of luminaries in law and politics including the 2nd President of France, Adolphe Thiers, former Prime Minister of France, √âdouard Balladur, former President of the National Assembly of France, F√©lix Gouin, and former Minister of Justice of France, Adolphe Cr√©mieux. The school has also educated two Nobel laureates: Ren√© Cassin, winner of the 1968 Nobel Peace Prize, and Fr√©d√©ric Mistral, winner of the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature. Alumni also include the 3rd President of Lebanon, √âmile Edd√©,Kais M. Firro, \\"Inventing Lebanon: Nationalism and the State under the Mandate\\", I.B. Tauris & Co Ltd, 2003, p. 108Raghid El-Solh, \\"Lebanon and Arabism: National Identity and State Formation\\", The Centre for Lebanese Studies, Oxford, 2004, p. 14 former Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Vasil Kolarov, former Prime Minister of Angola, Fernando Jos√© de Fran√ßa Dias Van-D√∫nem, and former Prime Minister of Cambodia, Norodom Ranariddh. In addition, from 1858 to 1861, a prominent French artist and Post- Impressionist painter Paul C√©zanne attended the school, while also receiving drawing lessons.John Powell, \\"Biographical Dictionary of Literary Influences: The Nineteenth Century, 1800‚Äì1914\\", Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc., 2001, p. 81 =Business and Management Studies= The Aix-Marseille Graduate School of Management, commonly known as IAE Aix-en-Provence, was the first Graduate School of Management in the French public university system. IAE Aix is \\"a prestigious, double-accredited institution, with an international approach to business combining both classic and innovative teaching methods\\", according to The Independent. It is the only French public university entity to receive dual international accreditation: the European standard of excellence EQUIS in 1999, and the AMBA accreditation in 2004 for its MBA Change & Innovation, in 2005 for its master's programmes and in 2007 for its Executive Part-time MBA. The school is composed of 40 permanent faculty members, and invites more than 30 international professors and 150 business speakers each year to conduct lectures and courses within the various programmes. IAE Aix offers graduate level programmes in general management, international management, internal audit of organisations, service management, internal and external communications management, management and information technologies, international financial management and applied marketing. In 2011, the M.Sc. in General Management was ranked 2nd in France along with the M.Sc. in Services Management and Marketing being ranked 3rd and the M.Sc. in Audit and Corporate Governance also being ranked 3rd in the country by SMBG. In 1990, IAE Aix and ESSEC Business School (√âcole sup√©rieure des sciences √©conomiques et commerciales) signed an agreement to unite and offer a joint Doctorate Programme, allowing ESSEC professors to teach in the Research Oriented Master programme in Aix-en-Provence. Furthermore, after Research Oriented Master graduation, students can attend the ESSEC Doctorate seminars and have an ESSEC Research Advisor (Directeur de Recherche). In the same way, ESSEC students can enroll in the IAE Aix's Research Oriented Master and Doctorate programmes. In both cases, the members of the thesis juries come from both IAE Aix and ESSEC. The Doctorate title is awarded by Aix-Marseille University.PhD in Business Administration ‚Äì ESSEC Business School =Economics= Aix-Marseille School of Economics (AMSE) is a gathering of three big laboratories in economics, part of AMU: GREQAM (Groupement de Recherche en Economie Quantitative d'Aix Marseille), SESSTIM (Sciences √âconomiques & Sociales de la Sant√© & Traitement de l'Information M√©dicale), and IDEP (Institut D‚ÄôEconomie Publique). GREQAM is a research center which specializes in all areas of economics, with strong concentrations in macroeconomics, econometrics, game theory, economic philosophy and public economics. It counts two Fellows of the Econometric Society among its members, and is consistently ranked as one of the top five research centers in economics in France. SESSTIM consists of three teams in social and economic sciences, as well as social epidemiology, focusing on applications in the following fields: cancer, infectious and transmissible diseases, and aging. IDEP aims at federating competences in the field of Public Economics broadly defined as the part of economics that studies the causes and the consequences of public intervention in the economic sphere. AMSE has a triple aim in terms of research development about \\"Globalization and public action\\", education regarding Master and PhD degrees and valorization toward local authorities, administrations and corporations, and of information aiming at all public. The AMSE Master is a two-year Master programme in Economics jointly organized with Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and Ecole Centrale de Marseille. It aims to provide high- level courses and training in the main fields of specialization of AMSE: Development Economics, Econometrics, Public Economics, Environmental Economics, Finance/Insurance, Macroeconomics, Economic Philosophy, and Health Economics. The doctoral programme of AMSE brings together more than seventy PhD students. Ten to fifteen new PhD students join the programme each year. These PhD students cover all the research topics available at AMSE. The PhD programme is a member of the European Doctoral Group in Economics (EDGE) with the University of Cambridge, the University of Copenhagen, University College Dublin, Bocconi University, and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. =Medicine= The Faculty of Medicine at AMU can trace its origins to a college of medicine established in 1645 and recognized by a decree issued by the Council of State of France in 1683. During the revolution, although a faculty of medicine was created in Montpellier, Marseille was left aside, probably because of its close proximity. In 1818, √âcole Secondaire de M√©decine et de Pharmacie opened in Marseille and this later became an √âcole de Plein Exercice in 1841. Consequently, it was not until 1930 that a faculty of medicine was formally organised in Marseille.C. D. O'Malley, The History of Medical Education: UCLA Forum in Medical Sciences, University of California Press, 1970, p. 152 However, the town's geographical position meant that it was able to exert a strong influence upon the Mediterranean. The most significant example of this was Antoine Clot, known as Clot Bey, who with the help of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, founded a school of medicine in Cairo in 1827. This enabled Egyptian students to travel to France and encouraged exchanges between western and eastern medicine. In Marseille, medical practices adapted to tropical diseases developed under the influence of the military department of medicine. Physiology at the faculty dates back to Charles Livon, who was named professeur suppl√©ant (deputy professor) and then professeur agr√©g√© (associate professor) of anatomy and physiology having presented his thesis in Paris. He conducted research on hypophysis and pneumogastric physiology, which earned him the Monthyon Prize at the French Academy of Sciences. Following his work with Louis Pasteur, he opened an anti-rabies clinic and became Mayor of Marseille in 1895. The first dean of the faculty was Leon Imbert, who arrived in Marseille in 1904 as a former interne des h√¥pitaux and professeur agr√©g√© at the Montpellier faculty. Originally a surgeon, he established one of the first centers for maxillofacial prosthetics for the gueules cass√©es (broken faces) of the Great War. An anti-cancer center was developed by Lucien Cornill, who was originally from Vichy and studied in Paris. During the First World War, he worked at the neurological center in the 7th Military region of Besan√ßon under the supervision of Gustave Roussy. After the war, he became a professeur agr√©g√© of pathological anatomy. He became dean of the faculty in 1937 and held this position until 1952. His main work related to clinical neurology and medullary pathology.Julien Bogousslavsky, Following Charcot: A Forgotten History of Neurology and Psychiatry, Karger Publishers, 2011, p. 179 The Faculty of Pharmacy started its independent activity after being separated from the faculty in 1970. Subsequently, the Faculty of Odontology also became independent from the Faculty of Medicine. Thus, these three faculties form the Division of Health of the university. =Earth Sciences and Astronomy= The university's Astronomy Observatory of Marseille-Provence (OAMP) is one of the French National observatories under the auspices of the National Institute of Astronomy (INSU) of the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), with a large financial participation by the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES). Basic research at the OAMP is organized around three priority themes: cosmology and research on dark matter and dark energy, galaxy formation and evolution, stellar and planetary system formation and exploration of the solar system. The OAMP also contributes to the area of environmental sciences and especially the study of the climatic system. The OAMP is very active in technological research and development, mainly in optics and opto-mechanics, for the development of the main observational instruments that will be deployed on the ground and in space in the coming decades. For many years OAMP research teams have had close ties with the French and European space and optical industry. The OAMP takes part in university education in astrophysics, physics and mathematics, as well as in instrumentation and signal processing from the first year of university to the doctorate level. These programs lead to openings in the fields of research and high-tech industry. The OAMP organizes many astronomy outreach activities in order to share important discoveries with the public. The OAMP consists of two establishments: the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille (LAM) and the Observatory of Haute- Provence (OHP), along with the D√©partement Gassendi, which is a common administrative and technical support unit. With over 50 researchers, 160 engineers, technical and administrative personnel, plus some 20 graduate students and post-docs, the OAMP is one of the most important research institutes in the region. =Engineering= Polytech Marseille is a Grande Ecole d'Ing√©nieurs (Graduate School of Science and Engineering), part of AMU. The School offers 8 specialist courses in New Technologies which lead to an engineering degree after 5 years of studies. Polytech Marseille is also a member of the Polytech Group which comprises 13 engineering schools of French leading universities. Polytech Marseille's advanced level courses have a strong professional focus. They include compulsory work placements in a professional organisation. These programs also benefit from a top rank scientific environment, with teaching staff drawn from laboratories attached to major French research organisations that are among the leaders in their field. Students are recruited on the basis of a selective admissions process which goes via one of two nationwide competitive admissions examinations (concours): either after the baccalaur√©at (national secondary school graduation examination) for admission to a five-year course or after two years of higher education for admission to a three-year course. The courses are approved by the Commission des Titres d'Ing√©nieur (CTI), the French authority that authorizes recognised engineering schools to deliver the Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur (a state-recognised title, recognised equivalent to a \\"Master in Engineering\\" by AACRAO) and thus guarantees the quality of the courses. The courses are also accredited by EUR-ACE. =Rankings and reputation= In the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), AMU is ranked joint 101st‚Äì150th in the world.

Organization  H√¥tel Boyer de Fonscolombe, a monument historique built in 1650, houses the Institute of Public Management and Territorial Governance Aix-Marseille University is organized into five sectors: * Law and Political Science ** Faculty of Law and Political Science ** Institute of Public Management and Territorial Governance * Economics and Management ** Faculty of Economics and Management ** Journalism and Communication School of Marseille ** Aix-Marseille Graduate School of Management ** Regional Institute of Labour * Arts, Literature, Languages and Human Sciences ** Faculty of Arts, Literature, Languages and Human Sciences ** Training Centre for Musicians ** The Mediterranean House of Human Sciences (Maison m√©diterran√©enne des sciences de l'homme) * Health ** Faculty of Medicine ** Faculty of Odontology ** Faculty of Pharmacy ** Midwives' University School Marseille M√©diterran√©e * Sciences and Technology ** Faculty of Sciences ** Faculty of Sports ** Observatory of Universe Sciences ‚Äì Pytheas Institute ** Polytech Marseille In addition, three University Institutes of Technology and University Institute for Teachers Training are part of the university. Governance The Pharo AMU is governed by the President, the Vice Presidents, the General Director of Services and Deputy Directors General of Services and the Accounting Officer. They meet on a weekly basis to discuss the main affairs of the university and to devise the strategic orientations which will be examined by the university councils. A second meeting with all the deans and directors takes place immediately afterwards to discuss more specific issues regarding internal activities of the various faculties and schools.Aix-Marseille University Governing Bodies ‚Äì Presentation of AMU The Administrative Council comprises 30 members: academics, teaching staff, administrative and technical personnel, students and external members. Its role is to determine the university general policy.Conseil d'administration The Academic CouncilConseil Acad√©mique consists of two bodies: The Research Committee, composed of 40 members, drafts policy proposals for research, scientific and technical documentation, and the allocation of research funding.Commission de la Recherche The Education and Student Life Committee, composed of 40 members, drafts policy proposals on the curriculum, on requests for authorization and projects for new programs, and on the assessment of programs and teaching.Commission de la Formation et de la Vie Universitaire ‚Äì CFVU If the President of the university is the most important actor in defining the mission and the strategies of the university, he also has the necessary power to impulse or to sustain the projects that relate to these strategies. Before implementing these projects, they have to be accepted by the university council and if necessary they have to be included in the planning processes. There are two main planning processes in the definition of projects in the university that have to be followed in order to be financed or even authorised and accredited by the public (national and local) authorities. The first process takes place every six years and involves the central government, the region as well as the university. It is devoted to major investment projects, for instance building a new school, a new campus, a new library, etc. It is a catalogue of projects and for each of them it defines the financial burden accepted by each partner in the contract. The second process covers four years and has to be approved by the French Ministry of Education. In this process, the university sets its objectives at the pedagogical and research levels (new degrees, research projects). This planning process is very important because the university is free to define its own strategy, to be approved by the decision makers. Each process generates an important brainstorming period at all levels of the university in order to identify and build new ideas, new needs, and opportunities, to prioritise them, after an analysis of strengths and weaknesses. Other choices can be made after each process is closed, but they are more difficult to implement because other sources of funding and other ways of authorisation must be found. Alumni AMU has produced many alumni that have distinguished themselves in their respective fields. Notable AMU alumni include three Nobel Prize laureates, a two-time recipient of the Pulitzer Prize, four C√©sar Award winners and numerous members of the component academies of the Institut de France.

The battle took in place near Dyme in north-west Achaea and was fought in 226 BC. Prelude Following the declaration of war against Sparta by the Achaean League in around 229-228 BC,Polybius 2.46 the fighting between the two countries had almost been continuous. Cleomenes had crushed two Achaean armies under the command of Aratus of Sicyon at the Battle of Mount Lycaeum and at the Battle of Ladoceia in 227 BC.Polybius 2.51 After these victories, Cleomenes returned to Sparta and began radical reforms. He abolished the ephors,Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 8Green, Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, 257 changed land laws, cancelled debt, and he also changed his army into one of the Macedonian style.Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 11 Following these reforms, Cleomenes with his reformed army answered to appeals from the city of Mantinea and after ridding it of its Achaean garrison advanced north into the Achaean heartland.Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 14 Battle After advancing into Achaea, Cleomenes descended upon Pharae, a founding member of the League. His aim was to provoke a battle with the Achaeans, or if they didn't come to meet him in battle, to discredit Aratus. The strategos at the time was Hyperbatas, however Aratus had complete control of the League. As Cleomenes was besieging the city of Dyme, the full Achaean army came out to meet him. When Cleomenes saw them pitch camp, deciding not to battle the enemy while his rear was exposed to attacks from the garrison of Dyme, he advanced on the Achaean position. In the pitched battle that followed, the Spartan phalanx routed the Achaean phalanx with the Achaeans sustaining heavy casualties and with many of the survivors being captured. Aftermath This defeat crushed the Achaeans and forced them to sue for peace. Cleomenes offered to give back any cities he seized from the Achaeans and to return any prisoners he had taken in return for being made strategus of the Achaean League. It may be however how Plutarch states that the Achaeans, after seeing his many victories wished for Cleomenes to command them.Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 15Green, Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, 258 However, Aratus who was against this proposal sent ambassadors to the court of King Antigonus III Doson where he requested Antigonus' aid against the Spartans which he received in return for giving Acrocorinth to Macedon.Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 16 In 224 BC, Antigonus advanced into the Peloponnese with an army of 30,000 men and forced Cleomenes to retreat to Laconia, the Spartan heartland.Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 22 In 222 BC, the Macedonian-Achaean army and the Spartan army clashed at the Battle of Sellasia which ended in an allied victory.Polybius 2.69 This victory forced Cleomenes to flee from Greece and go to Egypt.Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 29Green, Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, 261 Antigonus took Sparta, making him the first foreigner to ever capture Sparta.

Although relatively obscure now, in his own day he was compared favorably with his contemporary, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as a composer of opera buffa. In his time he was called \\"Martini lo spagnuolo\\" (\\"Martini the Spaniard\\"); in modern times, he has been called \\"the Valencian Mozart\\". He was known primarily for his melodious Italian comic operas and his work with Lorenzo Da Ponte in the late 18th century, as well as the melody from Una cosa rara quoted in the dining scene of Mozart's Don Giovanni. Biography Mart√≠n y Soler was born in Valencia. His father, Francisco Xavier Mart√≠n, was a tenor at the cathedral in town, where Vicente was a chorister there in his youth. Vicente moved to Madrid probably around 1775, and studied music in Bologna under Giovanni Battista Martini. His first opera was Il tutore burlato (1775), to an Italian libretto adapted from Giovanni Paisiello's La frascatana, which in turn was based on a play of the same title by Filippo Livigni. This was premiered in 1775 at the Teatro Real Coliseo in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, north of Madrid. In 1776 or 1777 the composer had the libretto translated into Spanish and put it into zarzuela form, adding spoken dialogue, as La madrile√±a, o El tutor burlado. This was performed in Madrid during 1778, by which time Mart√≠n y Soler was back in Italy. After 1776, he wrote Italian operas, both comic and serious, which were performed throughout Italy. In 1777, he travelled to Naples, where he composed for the Teatro di San Carlo. During this period, he worked with choreographer Charles le Picq to compose four ballets d‚Äôaction: La Griselda (1779, derived from the libretto by Apostolo Zeno), Il ratto della Sabine (1780), La bella Arsene (1781), and Tamas Kouli-Kan (1781, an interpretation of Vittorio Amedeo Cigna-Santi's libretto). He also worked with Zeno on an opera seria, Andromaca, in 1780. In addition, he composed two mezzocarattere ballets, La sposa persiana (1778) and Il barbiere di Siviglia (1781, based on the play by Pierre Beaumarchais). In Naples, he also worked with court librettist Luigi Serio on the composition of opere serie, producing Ifigenia (1779) and Ipermestra (1780). Around 1780, he was also appointed court composer for Charles IV of Spain. In 1785 he moved to Vienna, where he enjoyed great success with three operas composed to texts by Lorenzo Da Ponte, who was simultaneously collaborating with Mozart and Antonio Salieri, the rival of the former. These three comedies were Una cosa rara (1786, based on the play La luna de la sierra by Luis V√©lez de Guevara); Il burbero di buon cuore (1786, based on the play by Carlo Goldoni); and L'arbore di Diana (1787). He is credited with introducing, in Una cosa rara, the waltz to Vienna; and a melody from the same work is quoted by Mozart in the banquet scene in Act 2 of Don Giovanni (1787).For a detailed discussion of this borrowing, see Daniel E. Freeman, Mozart in Prague (Minneapolis: Bearclaw, 2013), 222-24. Soon, Mart√≠n y Soler was also composing highly successful operas for Joseph II's imperial theater. In 1788, Mart√≠n y Soler was invited to serve as composer and singing instructor at Catherine's Russian court at St. Petersburg, where he wrote three Russian language operas, The Unfortunate Hero Kosmetovich (1789, libretto written in part by Catherine the Great), Melomania (1790), and Fedul and his Children (1791, with Vasili Pashkevich). Moving to London for the 1795 season, he provided three more Italian language operas: La capricciosa corretta (libretto again by Lorenzo Da Ponte, partly adapted from Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew); L'isola del piacere and Le nozze de' contadini spagnuoli. He returned to St. Petersburg and was appointed maestro di capella at the Smolny Institute (then called the Educational Society of Noble Maidens) in 1796.A.L. Porfir'eva, \\"Martin-i-Soler,\\" Muzykal'nyi Peterburg: Entsiklopedicheskii Slovar vol.II (St. Petersburg: Kompozitor, 2000), 183. After returning to St Petersburg, he wrote his last opera, La festa del villaggio (1798). He also wrote a number of tragic ballets during his residence as Court Composer there, including Didon abandon√©e (1792), Amour et Psych√© (1793, based on Psych√© by Moli√®re, Corneille and Philippe Quinault), Tancr√®de (1799) and Le retour de Poliorc√®te (1799). Shortly before his 1806 death in Saint Petersburg, he served as inspector for the Italian opera there. He was still in his post when he died.

The film is loosely based on an investigative series of articles written by Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist K. W. Lee on the conviction of immigrant Chol Soo Lee for a 1973 San Francisco Chinatown gangland murder. The news coverage led to a new trial, eventual acquittal and release of the prisoner from San Quentin's Death Row. Screenwriter Wesley Strick based the character of Eddie Dodd on real-life Bay Area defense attorney Tony Serra. Plot summary Eddie Dodd is a burnt-out attorney who has left behind civil rights work to defend drug dealers. Roger Baron is an idealistic young legal clerk, fresh out of law school, who encourages Dodd to take on the case of Shu Kai Kim, a young Korean man who was imprisoned for a gang-related murder committed in New York's Chinatown and has now killed a fellow inmate in self-defense. Kim's mother believes her son was wrongfully accused in the gang-related murder. Dodd and Baron's investigation leads to a conspiracy among the district attorney, a police informant, and several police officers.

In case of criminal occurrence (In flagrante delicto), Guards forward the occurrence to the Civil and / or Federal police. History The first groups assigned with security duties in Brazilian territory date back to the early sixteenth century.

In 1566, the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited.Rio de Janeiro Civil Police \\"Historical Data\\" Accessed September 5, 2007. By the seventeenth century, most \\"capitanias\\" already had local units with law enforcement functions. On July 9, 1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in Minas Gerais for maintaining order.

(Portuguese) In 1808, the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil, due to the French invasion of Portugal. King Jo√£o VI sought to reshape the administrative structure of the colony. Among several reforms, he established the \\"Intend√™ncia Geral de Pol√≠cia\\" (General Police Intendancy), which merged police units with investigative functions, call currently of Civil Police. He also created a Military Guard with police functions on 13 May 1809. This is considered a predecessor force of local military police units. Later, in 1831, when independence had already been declared, each province started organizing its local \\"military police\\", with order maintenance tasks. On 31 January 1842, law 261 was enacted, reorganizing the investigative offices, the current \\"civil police\\". The first federal police force, the Federal Railroad Police, was created in 1852. Finally, in 1871, law 2033 separated police and judicial functions, creating the general bureaucratic structure and mechanisms still adopted nowadays by local police forces.Tourinho Filho, F. 2004.

It patrols the streets and imprisons suspects of criminal activity, handing them over to Civil Police custody or, in case of federal crimes, to the Federal Police. It is a \\"militarized\\" institution (gendarmerie) because it is based on military principles of hierarchy, uniform, discipline, and ceremony. However, the body is not a branch of the Brazilian Armed Forces. It is described by the constitution as an \\"ancillary force of the Army in time of war\\".

Community Level The Municipal Guards (Portuguese: Guardas Municipais, singular: Guarda Municipal), also called the Municipal Civil Guards (Guardas Civis Municipais, singular: Municipal Civil Guard), are the security forces of municipalities (cities) of Brazil. Created in the time of the Empire of Brazil, the guardsmen are subordinated to the municipality mayors (prefeitos). Trained as a civilian uniformed agency, these city guards are responsible to police the municipal parks, properties, installations and the interior of municipal councils and city halls, according to the Brazilian Federal Constitution. Their patrols are called rondas (English:rounds) and there are 1,200 municipalities with Municipal Guards with more than 120,000 operatives according with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. They are treated as police officers by the former president of the IPA (International Police Association) Brazilian section, Mr. George Henry Millard. The former Brazilian Minister of Justice and former governor of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Mr. Tarso Genro, asked for them to be given more jurisdiction for their operatives, and especially for their official recognition by Brazil as public safety workers. The first step for this recognition was taken with the sanction of Federal Law number 13.022 - which regulated paragraph 8 of Article 144 of the Federal Constitution http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l13022.htm.

When approved on all tests, the candidate will be considered fit to military police service and admitted in special training courses (CTSP, to graduate soldiers, and the CFO, to graduate aspiring high-ranked officials). There's a minimum entry age of 18 years and, with few variations, a maximum entry age of 30 years. Candidates to military police lower ranks, such as 2nd class soldier (entry level), must meet a minimum of high school education. In the Civil Police as also in the Federal Police, police commissioners (\\"delegados\\") are responsible for coordinating and conducting all criminal investigations, with very similar functions and powers of those held by instruction magistrates or prosecutors in other legal systems. For that reason, those police commissioners are required to hold a full degree in Law and have law practicing or law enforcement experience of at least three years. Misconduct Reports of police misconduct, such as brutality and corruption, have harmed the reputation of police institutions in Brazil, especially state forces.Human Rights Report \\"Police brutality in urban Brazil\\" Accessed September 5, 2007.\\"Amnesty International reports on Violence in Brazil\\", SEJUP (Servico Brasileiro de Justica e Paz), News from Brazil, No. 489, 29 May 2003, Accessed September 5, 2007. Violence against suspects and extrajudicial executions are known to be employed by police. In the cities of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the Military Police has been involved in several controversial massacres of civilians, typically in poor neighborhoods where high-profile criminals tend to hide. There have also been massacres in prison facilities. One of the most notorious cases is the Carandiru massacre of 1992. Torture is still commonly used as means of questioning and punishing individuals.Amnesty International \\"Brazil - Police Brutality\\" Accessed September 5, 2007. Brazil‚Äôs corrections system is a huge problem for the country and it severely affects the overall well-being of its people. There are a lot of problems relating to violence, gangs and the way the government has been handling the problems. Brazil‚Äôs corrections system is under the prison administration called Departamento Penitenciario Nacional (DEPEN), and the head of this prison administration is Renato Campos Pinto de Vitto. The \\"favelas\\" (slums or a shantytown) in Brazil have many criminal gangs within them that protect individual favelas from other rival gangs and the law enforcement. The government has been seen as \\"ineffective\\" towards criminal activity within favelas and Brazil as a whole such as trafficking of humans and drugs, kidnapping, and robberies. Corruption and crime levels within Brazil remain high and Bolsonaro‚Äôs administration has aimed to help decrease these levels with the help of the police. Bolsonaro mentioned on his own social media page that criminals \\"should be\\" attacked by police officials, which can aid to the decrease in crime, thus creating a larger distrust towards law enforcement in Brazil. As of December 2017, the prison population in Brazil was at a total of 668,914, and when compared to a prison population rate per 100,000, the total is 332 per 100,000 people. The number of institutions Brazil has regarding their corrections system is 1,449.Brazil‚Äôs Correctional System http://prisonstudies.org/country/brazil The official capacity of the institutions is 404,509 people which is many more than they are supposed to be able to house.Brazil‚Äôs Correctional System In 2000, 232,755 people were incarcerated in Brazil. In 2016, 644,575 people were incarcerated. As of 2017, the President of Brazil (at the time Michel Temer) aimed to build 30 prisons that year to tackle the overcrowding crisis of their institutions.Brazil Aims to Build 30 Prisons This Year to Tackle Crisis. January 17, 2017. Brazil‚Äôs prisons are 50% over capacity, and most of the prisons are state-government run. The prisons are heavily controlled by gangs, drugs, guns and other contraband entering the prisons regularly. Many residents of favelas do not trust law enforcement because in 2008, the police killed an average of three people for every twenty-three people they arrested in Brazil. Crime levels are high due to extreme poverty levels and law enforcement refusing to patrol favelas. One of the more recent riots occurred between Brazil‚Äôs most powerful gang, First Capital Command, and their rival, Red command. First Capital Command slaughtered 26 other inmates at the Alca√ßuz prison in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. President Temer wants to build these new prisons to separate non-violent criminals from the dangerous ones to prevent recruitment into organized crime. Since a big part of their prison population problems are the gangs, President Temer has also said that Brazil will be more cooperative with neighboring countries to try to reduce gangs funded by drug trafficking. There is such bad overcrowding, some are close to three times their actual capacity. The frequent use of pepper spray, tear gas, noise bombs and rubber bullets has been documented, as have severe beatings and kicking by the prison personnel on the inmates.Brazil Must Address Prison Overcrowding and Implement Measures Against Torture. August 14, 2015. The prison personnel are also equipped with assault rifles, shotguns and handguns to protect themselves from the violent events that happen in their prisons and also to keep order of the super overcrowded prisons where inmates could easily overcome the employees.

A possible association with papillomavirus has been reported.  Prognosis  Generally, there is a good prognosis for low-grade tumors, and a poor prognosis for high-grade tumors, however recent research have found reoccurring low grade tumors also have a poor prognosis. Treatment Surgery is the recommended treatment for localised resectable disease. When the tumour is incompletely resected (positive margins) post-operative radiotherapy gives local control comparable to a complete resection (clear margins). Sometimes when surgery is not possible due to extent of disease or if a patient is too frail for surgery, or declines surgery, palliative radiotherapy may be helpful. There has been a report of a case where low dose radiotherapy achieve disease response and control for more than 4 years. In patients with metastatic disease, chemotherapy response tends to be low (27% partial response rate) and short lived. Epidemiology Occurs in adults, with peak incidence from 20‚Äì40 years of age.

It takes its name from Mount Wangjae in Onsong-gun, North Hamgyong Province, on the border with China, where Kim Il-sung is said to have held a meeting for anti-Japanese activities in 1933. The band was established by the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on 22 July 1983. Its music was often broadcast over Korean Central Broadcasting Station channels such as Radio Pyongyang.

Travelling from the Port Adelaide region, it is mostly a double-lane sealed road (triple-laned between South Road and Cavan Road/Churchill Road and between Main North Road/Port Wakefield Road and Hampstead Road/Briens Road) (becoming a single-lane road past Tolley Road intersection at Hope Valley, South Australia) running 21 kilometres to the base of the Adelaide Hills. The western end at the intersection of Old Port Road, 300 metres east of a causeway which separates the Port River from West Lakes. The 2.4 kilometre section of road that continues west of Old Port Road to Semaphore South is named Bower Road. The eastern end of Grand Junction Road is in the suburb of Hope Valley, at the intersection of Hancock Road and Lower North East Road, just before the latter proceeds into the Adelaide Hills, past Anstey Hill Recreation Park and on towards the towns of Houghton and Inglewood. History The Grand Junction, located at today's intersection of Grand Junction Road and Churchill Road, is the meeting point of what was once the most accessible route out of Adelaide City to the north (over the Torrens via Port Road). It was the intersection of the North Road, later called the Lower North Road (today's Cavan Road), and the east‚Äìwest road from Upper Dry Creek to the Port (today's Grand Junction Road from Walkley's Road to Cavan Road). It remained so until January 1843, when migrant labourers completed a new bridge spanning 120 feet over the Torrens River. This enabled travellers to take the more direct route northward on the road from the city to Gawler Town (later called the Great North Road, today Main North Road), and the junction of roads at Gepp's Cross took on a greater significance than the Grand Junction. In the mid-1850s the track and road from the upper Dry Creek, past the Grand Junction Inn, to the Port, was variously called ‚Äòroad to the Port‚Äô, ‚ÄòPort Road,‚Äô or ‚ÄòGrand Junction' to (Port) 'Causeway Road‚Äô. In November 1854 the Legislative Council requested the Central Road Board estimate the cost of a continuous road from the Grand Junction to the \\"Port-road near Albert Town\\", rendered necessary by the formation of the Adelaide and Port Railway. The road upgrade was shelved though for two years. In 1856 the Central Road Board resolved to upgrade the poor roadway between the Grand Junction Inn and Albert Town through the Alberton Swamp. The matter was a serious concern for many district councils north of Adelaide and, in a united front, the district councils flooded the Legislative Council with petitions. On 9 May the Legislative Council passed a motion \\"for ¬£2,500 to be placed on the Estimates, to form the road from the Grand Junction to Alberton.\\" Official reference to ‚ÄòGrand Junction Road‚Äô was made by the government in a message (No. 42) received from the Governor-in-Chief which appropriate funds for the road to the Central Road Board in 1856. Progress on the road was slow, and it was not until May 1857 that approval was given to metal (pave) the new road with compacted limestone. The woes of the road dragged on. Tenderers defaulted and further works were ordered, including an additional 1,000 cubic yards of limestone on the swamp that still was not laid by the end of 1858. The road between the Grand Junction Inn and Alberton across the swamp turned into a money pit for the road board and the community. The saga continued for years. In July 1861 the Central Road Board yet again called for tenders to make 19 chains of the Grand Junction Road over sands at Alberton Swamp. Popular usage of the name \\"Grand Junction Road\\" greatly increased after the upgrade was completed in the early 1860s. Major intersections There are a number of major intersections along Grand Junction Road, the largest being at Gepps Cross, where Main North Road and Port Wakefield Road meet at a five-way crossing. Main North Road joins from the south and continues on to the north- east, towards Parafield, Elizabeth and Gawler, while Port Wakefield Road begins at this location, travelling due north to the northern Adelaide Plains and 90 kilometres to the town of Port Wakefield. The original Grand Junction at the intersection with Churchill and Cavan Roads was once a five-way intersection used by most northbound travel out of Adelaide. Another intersection was added in 2011, the Gallipoli Drive. The road is also officially part of the National Highway system, and therefore attracts a shield and federal funding. The National Highway runs south (from Port Augusta) off the Salisbury Highway/South Road connector intersection, heads east along Grand Junction Road through Gepps Cross (where it meets another National Highway, Main North Road (A20), north-east to Sydney), to the Hampstead Road intersection a few kilometres away where it turns south (to Melbourne). Grand Junction Road continues on without the National shield. In 2011, construction began on the South Road superway and as a result, changes have been made to Grand Junction road. South Road now goes over this road and connects to the Port River Expressway Highway. Railway crossings Due to the configuration of the Adelaide railway system north of the Adelaide city centre, there are a number of current and former railway crossings over Grand Junction Road. These include: * The bridge over the Adelaide to Outer Harbor railway line at Alberton * A disused level crossing over the Dry Creek-Port Adelaide railway line, at Rosewater * A dismantled level crossing in the proximity of Glenroy Street and Eastern Parade, at Pennington and Ottoway (On the former Finsbury railway line) * The bridge over the Adelaide to Gawler and Adelaide-Port Augusta railway at Kilburn and Wingfield * The Adelaide O-Bahn underpass at Holden Hill (Dedicated Busway) Educational institutions =Adjoining institutions= A number of schools and other education institutions front onto Grand Junction Road.

In some estates there may be no known heirs, or there may be missing heirs whose names are known but their contact information is not. There also may be known heirs from one part of the family, but another part of the family may be unknown. In all these instances, professional probate researchers work to trace the next-of-kin. Probate researchers are also called heir hunters, heir searchers, and forensic genealogists. Intestacy laws vary enormously from one country to another, and in the US, they also vary from state to state. Thus probate researchers must have extensive knowledge of the law to know which family members are legally entitled to inherit. They also employ specialized genealogical and investigative techniques to search public records and databases to identify the extended family of the deceased, often starting with no more than a name and date of death and in some cases looking for relatives as distant as second cousins. In many cases the heirs that are finally identified have little or no knowledge of the person from whom they are inheriting. Probate researchers are hired by solicitors in the United Kingdom, or Estate Attorneys in the United States. It is also common for them to independently review many cases to find a single case with missing or unknown heirs. Popular culture The BBC has made nine series (180 programs) of Heir Hunters, shown on UK BBC TV about a number of UK companies. Episodes have also been screened in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The future of probate research As the population lives longer due to improved health, and is more mobile the problem of tracing missing heirs potentially becomes more difficult despite the growth of more web based research tools. Many people are still reluctant to draft a proper will, or make bad ones which later prove invalid, or can easily be contested. As a consequence millions pass to the state, after a qualify period in trust waiting for claims from entitled beneficiaries, or being found by probate researchers or Heir Hunters.

It is an example of contest literature, comparing the love of women and the love of boys, and concluding that the latter is preferable over the former. The dialogue is traditionally attributed to the satirist Lucian and was transmitted as part of the corpus of his writings. Some modern scholars believe that the dialogue was probably not written by Lucian on account of its style, but others‚Äîincluding among those who do not vouch for its authenticity‚Äîhave posited that the style resembles that of Lucian. The work is normally cited under the name of Pseudo-Lucian but acceptance of its authenticity has increased in the 2010s. The Er≈çtes is also famous for its vivid description of the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles. The same subject is treated in the Amatorius of Plutarch and Leucippe and Clitophon by Achilles Tatius, but with the opposite conclusion in the former and with the latter reaching no verdict. In terms of structure, the dialogue may be considered similar to Plato's works, in which Socrates is often in contest with another man. Summary The Amores begins as a dialogue between Lycinus and Theomnestus. The second dialogue consists of a contest between Callicratidas and Charicles to decide which is the more desirable: the love for boys or the love for women (respectively). Authorship The authorship of the work was first questioned in depth in an essay published in 1907 by a classicist named Robert Bloch. In the late 1990s, Judith Mossman, without weighing in explicitly on the authorship of the text, comments, however, that \\"many of the literary techniques employed are utterly typical of Lucian himself; if this work is by an imitator, (s)he was a very skillful one.\\" James Jope, defending more explicitly the authenticity of the dialogue, states that it was common in Bloch's era to judge the authenticity of works of literature from classical antiquity \\"on tenuous grounds\\", adding that \\"critics sensitive to irony, ambivalence, and different authorial personae have a very different appreciation of Lucian than Bloch's generation\\". Like Bloch, Jope also performs an analysis of the vocabulary of the text, but contra Bloch, he shows that the words employed there, including the rarer and more idiosyncratic ones, used before to deny Lucian's authorship, are actually found in other writings uncontroversially ascribed to him. Reception For most of the twentieth century, the Amores was regarded as inauthentic and was not studied by many scholars. It was brought to renewed scholarly attention in 1984 when Michel Foucault examined the text in The History of Sexuality.

Subsequent to her escape, when she was living in London, England, she wrote her slave narrative The History of Mary Prince (1831), which was the first account of the life of a black woman to be published in the United Kingdom. This first-hand description of the brutalities of enslavement, released at a time when slavery was still legal in Bermuda and British Caribbean colonies, had a galvanising effect on the anti-slavery movement. It was reprinted twice in its first year. Prince had her account transcribed while living and working in England at the home of Thomas Pringle, a founder of the Anti-Slavery Society. She had gone to London with her master and his family in 1828 from Antigua. Early life and education Mary Prince was born into enslavement at Devonshire Parish (originally named Cavendish, after William Cavendish, First Earl of Devonshire (1552‚Äì1626), the name was subsequently changed to Devonshire, but it was also sometimes referred to as Brackish Pond). The area of Devonshire in which she grew up (and the various houses in which she had lived) was to be mostly acquired by the War Office later in the 19th Century to enable the growth of Prospect Camp. Her father (whose only given name was Prince) was a sawyer owned by David Trimmingham, and her mother a house-servant held by Charles Myners. She had three younger brothers and two sisters, Hannah and Dinah.The History of Mary Prince: A West Indian Slave, F. Westley and A. H. Davis (eds). 1831. Online HTML edition, New York Public Library. When Myners died in 1788, Mary Prince, her mother and siblings were sold as household servants to Captain Darrell. He gave Mary and her mother to his daughter, with Mary becoming the companion servant of his young granddaughter, Betsey Williams. At the age of 12, Mary was sold for ¬£38 sterlingThe History of Mary Prince, p. 5. (Present day: ~¬£4484) to Captain John Ingham, of Spanish Point. Her two sisters were also sold that same day, all to different enslavers. Mary's new enslaver and his wife were cruel and often lost their tempers, Mary and others were often severely flogged for minor offences. Ingham sold Mary in 1806 to an enslaver on Grand Turk in The Turks and Caicos Islands, who owned salt ponds. The Bermudians had used these seasonally for a century for the extraction of salt from the ocean. The production of salt for export was a pillar of the Bermudian economy, but the production was labour-intensive. Originally, raking had been performed by whites due to the fear of black enslaved people being seized by Spanish and French raiders (the enslaved were considered property, and could be seized as such during hostilities). Blacks crewed the Bermuda sloops that delivered the rakers to and from the Turks Islands and delivered salt to markets in North America, engaging in maritime activities while the whites raked. When the threats posed by the Spanish and French in the region decreased, however, the enslaved were put to work in the salt pans. As a child Mary worked in poor conditions in the salt ponds up to her knees in water. Due to the nature of salt mining, Mary and others were often forced to work up to 17 hours straight as owners of the ponds were concerned that if the workers were gone for too long rain would come and soil the salt. Generally, men were the salt rakers, forced to work in the salt ponds, where they were exposed to the sun and heat, as well as the salt in the pans, which ate away at their uncovered legs. Women did packaging of salt. Mary Prince was returned to Bermuda in 1810, where her master at the time had moved with his daughter. While here, she was physically abused by her master, and forced to bathe him under threat of further beatings. Mary resisted her master's abuse on two occasions: once, in defence of his daughter, whom he also beat; the second time, defending herself from her master when he beat her for dropping kitchen utensils. After this, she left his direct service and was hired out to Cedar Hill for a time, where she earned money for her master by washing clothes. In 1815, Mary was sold a fourth time, to John Adams Wood of Antigua for $300 (2017: ~$4600). She worked in his household as a domestic slave, attending the bedchambers, nursing a young child, and washing clothes. There she began to suffer from rheumatism, which left her unable to work. When Adams Wood was travelling, Mary earned money for herself by taking in washing and by selling coffee, yams and other provisions to ships.The History of Mary Prince, pp. 15‚Äì16. In Antigua, she joined the Moravian Church, where she also attended classes and learned to read. She was baptised in the English church in 1817 and accepted for communion, but she was afraid to ask Adams Wood for permission to attend.The History of Mary Prince, p. 17. In December 1826, Prince married Daniel James, a formerly enslaved man who had bought his freedom by saving money from his work. He worked as a carpenter and cooper. According to Mary, her floggings increased after her marriage because Adams Wood and his wife did not want a free black man living on their property. Travel to England In 1828 Adams Wood and his family travelled to London, visiting and arranging their son's education, and to bring their daughters home to the islands.Pringle (1831), \\"Supplement\\", p. 30. At her request, they took Mary Prince with them as a servant. After the case of Somerset v Stewart in 1772, it was ruled that it was illegal to transport slaves out of England. That, however, did not make slavery illegal in England, even though public opinion believed it did.Simon Schama, Rough Crossings (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 51‚Äì61. Even if she could leave the Adam Wood's household, however, she had no means to support herself alone in England. Additionally, unless Wood formally emancipated her, she could not return to her husband in Antigua without being re-enslaved there. Although she had served the Woods for more than ten years, they had increasing conflict in England. Four times Wood told her to obey or leave. They gave her a letter that nominally gave her the right to leave but suggested that no one should hire her.Pringle, \\"Supplement to The History of Mary Prince\\", The History of Mary Prince, 1831, pp. 24‚Äì25, e-text, New York Public Library. Retrieved 5 April 2013. After leaving the household, Prince took shelter with the Moravian church in Hatton Garden. Within a few weeks, she started working occasionally for Thomas Pringle, an abolitionist writer, and Secretary to the Anti-Slavery Society, which offered assistance to blacks in need. Prince found work with the Forsyth household, but the couple moved away from England in 1829. The Woods also left England in 1829 and returned with their daughter to Antigua. Pringle tried to arrange to have Wood manumit Prince, so she would have legal freedom. In 1829 Adams Wood refused either to manumit Mary Prince or allow her to be purchased out of his control.The Times, 1 March 1833, p. 6: \\"Mr H. W. Ravenscroft, an attorney, stated that in 1829 he made an application to the plaintiff\\" (i.e. John Wood) \\"to manumit Mary Prince, which he refused. Money was offered, but the plaintiff refused on any terms; and said he would not move a finger for her.\\" His refusal to sell or free her meant that as long as slavery remained legal in Antigua, Prince could not return to her husband and friends without being re-enslaved and submitting to Wood's power. After trying to arrange a compromise, the Anti-Slavery Committee proposed to petition Parliament to grant Prince's manumission, but did not succeed.Pringle (1831), \\"Supplement\\", p. 26. At the same time, a bill was introduced to free all slaves from the West Indies in England whose owners had freely brought them there; it did not pass but was an indication of growing anti-slavery sentiment. Publication of The History of Mary Prince In December 1829, Pringle hired Prince to work in his own household. Encouraged by Pringle, Prince arranged for her life narrative to be transcribed by Susanna Strickland. Pringle served as editor, and her book was published in 1831 as The History of Mary Prince. The book caused a commotion as it was the first account published in Great Britain of a black woman's life; at a time when anti-slavery agitation was growing, her first person account touched many people. In the first year, it sold out three printings. Two libel cases arose out of it, and Prince was called to testify at each. Prince's life after her book was published is not much known. It is not clear whether she ever returned to Antigua and her husband as she had wished. She is known to have remained in England until at least 1833, when she testified in the two libel cases. That year, the Slavery Abolition Act was passed, to be effective August 1834.According to The Times, reporting the libel case Wood v. Pringle, Prince testified that in late February 1833, she was living in the Old Bailey. Pringle was supporting her at a charge of 10 or 12 shillings per week, as she had been out of work since the previous June. The Times, 1 March 1833, p. 6. In 1808, Parliament had passed the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which outlawed the slave trade but not slavery itself. The 1833 law was intended to achieve a two-staged abolition of West Indian slavery by 1840, allowing the colonies time to transition their economies. Because of popular protests in the West Indies among the freedmen, the colonies legally completed abolition two years early in 1838. In Bermuda, which was not dependent on the institution of slavery, emancipation took place immediately on the law going into effect in 1834. If Prince was still alive and in good health, she may then have returned as a free woman to her homeland. =The book and its influence= When Prince's book was published, slavery was still legal in England, and had not been abolished by the 1772 Somerset v Stewart ruling, as previously believed by some historians.Schama, Rough Crossings, p. 61. Parliament had also not yet abolished it in the colonies. There was considerable uncertainty about the political and economic repercussions that might arise if Britain imposed an end to slavery throughout the empire, as the sugar colonies depended on it for labour to raise their lucrative commodity crop. As a personal account, the book contributed to the debate in a manner different from reasoned analysis or statistical arguments. Its tone was direct and authentic, and its simple but vivid prose contrasted with the more laboured literary style of the day.Pringle, as her editor, was sufficiently aware of this effect to draw attention to it in his footnotes: \\"These strong expressions, and all of a similar character in this little narrative, are given verbatim as uttered by Mary Prince.--Ed.\\" An example is Prince's description of being sold away from her mother at a young age: > It was night when I reached my new home. The house was large, and built at > the bottom of a very high hill; but I could not see much of it that night. I > saw too much of it afterwards. The stones and the timber were the best > things in it; they were not so hard as the hearts of the owners.The History > of Mary Prince, 1831. Prince wrote of slavery with the authority of personal experience, something her political opponents could never match. She wrote: > I have been a slave myself‚ÄîI know what slaves feel‚ÄîI can tell by myself what > other slaves feel, and by what they have told me. The man that says slaves > be quite happy in slavery‚Äîthat they don't want to be free‚Äîthat man is either > ignorant or a lying person. I never heard a slave say so. I never heard a > Buckra (white) man say so, till I heard tell of it in England. Her book had an immediate effect on public opinion and was published in three impressions the first year.Moira Ferguson, \\"Prince , Mary (b. c.1788)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. It generated controversy, and James MacQueen, the editor of The Glasgow Courier, challenged its accuracy by a lengthy letter in Blackwood's Magazine.James Macqueen (sic), \\"The Colonial Empire of Great Britain\\", Blackwood's Magazine, vol. 30, November 1831, p. 744. MacQueen was a defender of white West Indian interests and vigorous critic of the anti-slavery movement. He depicted Prince as a woman of low morals who had been the \\"despicable tool\\" of the anti-slavery clique, who had incited her to malign her \\"generous and indulgent owners.\\" He attacked the character of the Pringle family, suggesting they were at fault for accepting the slave in their household.MacQueen (1831), \\"Colonial Empire\\", p. 751: \\"Pringle's labours afford a criterion to determine that the delicacy and modesty 'of the females of his family' cannot be of the most exalted character.\\" In 1833 Pringle sued MacQueen for libel, receiving damages of ¬£5.Pringle v. Cadell, Court of Common Pleas, 21 February 1833: reported in The Times, 22 February 1833, p. 4. As Cadell was the London publisher of Blackwood's Magazine, he was cited in the lawsuit. Not long afterwards, John Wood, Prince's master, sued Pringle for libel, holding him responsible as the editor of Prince's The History, and claiming the book generally misrepresented his character.The Times, 1 March 1833, p. 6: Wood v. Pringle, Court of King's Bench, 27 February 1833. Wood won his case and was awarded ¬£25 in damages. Prince was called to testify in both these trials, but little is known of her life after this.

The channel broadcasts in over 60 countries and 12 languages, and covers extreme sport and adventure sports which include surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding, wakeboarding, motocross, BMX, mountain biking, FMX, music, gaming and fashion. The vision and idea for the Extreme brand franchise and TV channel came from Alistair Gosling, founder of Extreme International, an ambassador for action and adventure sports, supporter of several global marine conservation projects, , and is on the international advisory board of Qiddiya, ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÇÿØŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ´ŸÖÿßÿ± the 334-square-km sports, entertainment and cultural destination being developed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is a supporter of Medshr.net the award winning medical network that is helping save lives through peer to peer learning between doctors. History In 1998 Alistair Gosling, founder of Extreme, started approaching potential investors to back the plan for a new brand and TV network dedicated to extreme and adventure sports. UPCtv, the programming arm of the Dutch-based cable television operator UPC, was looking for new channels to offer its subscribers and in April 1998 Ben Barrett was approached by Stephen Cohen, UPCtv's Chief Operating Officer, at the MIP programming market in Cannes, France, with a proposal for a joint venture between the two companies. Extreme partnered with UPC and the Extreme Sports Channel was launched from the Netherlands on 1 May 1999, and in the UK in 2000. The channel was designed by Gosling and Cohen, alongside five other new channels for the European market, and its content was supplied by Extreme International. In late 1999, Extreme launched its United States operations, and charged veteran producer, Lloyd Bryan Adams with the task of heading up the North American presence. They launched EXtreme TV, a branded block on Fox Sports Net in March 2012. In 2005, after launching the channel in over sixty countries, and seeing the growth in digital coming Extreme acquired the Extreme brand and sold its 50% stake in Extreme Sports Channel to John Malone's Liberty Global Inc. which had by then become owner of UPC. The channel was put under the management of Chellomedia. Since the transaction and as adventure and extreme sports have rapidly grown and moved into the mainstream Extreme have gone onto grow its community to over 20 million, and develop the brand and business across destinations, adventure sports parks and resorts digital media network and production studios, sports marketing services and licensing, events and experiences. As part of its central brand marketing activities Extreme supports and sponsors 128 grass roots and profesional athelets, activates 84 events each year and delivers over 100 million video views each month through its digital media network. The channel launched in Poland in January 2006, followed by France in that same year. The UK version of the channel was free-to-air from launch until the summer of 2006, when a deal with BSkyB meant that it became encrypted. On 28 September 2011 the channel began broadcasting in widescreen (16:9) format. On 1 February 2012 the high-definition version of the channel began broadcasting in Italy. AMC Networks acquired Chellomedia on 2 February 2014. Chellomedia was rebranded by AMC Networks International on 8 July 2014.BroadbandTVNews.com: Chellomedia to become AMC Networks International On 31 December 2015, the channel was removed from the Sky EPG.

Archibald McLean (April 5, 1791 - October 24, 1865) was a lawyer, judge and political figure in Upper Canada. Early life McLean was born at St. Andrews in the Lunenburg District in 1791, the son of Lt.-Col. The Hon. Neil McLean and Isabella McDonell of Leek. He studied at John Strachan's school in Cornwall and articled in law with William Firth. War of 1812 On the outbreak of the War of 1812 he joined the 3rd Regiment of York Militia as a Subaltern and was seriously wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights. He was carried from the battlefield to a nearby village by John Cawthra where his wounds were hurriedly dressed. Because of an infection caused by the late removal of a bullet he was not fit to fight when the Americans attacked York in April, 1813. McLean buried the York militia's colours in the woods and escaped to Kingston, Ontario. He fought again at Battle of Lundy's Lane, but was captured by the Americans and held prisoner for the remainder of the war. Politics In 1815 he turned down a commission into the British regular army, joining the law firm of William Warren Baldwin before starting his own lucrative law firm in Cornwall, Ontario. In 1820, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Stormont; he held that seat until 1834, shared for the previous four years with his old school friend Philip VanKoughnet. He was then elected to represent Cornwall and became Speaker of the Assembly in 1836. He was a leading Tory member and advocated the rights of the Presbyterian Church to be equal to those of the Church of England. Upper Canada Rebellion He was named colonel in the militia during the Upper Canada Rebellion and commanded the left flank of the loyalist forces under Colonel James FitzGibbon at the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern. McLean initially opposed the Union of Upper and Lower Canada out of fear that Upper Canadians would be dominated by French Canadians. He saw responsible government as a danger to the British connection and to the ordered freedom and the recognition of class and property of the British tradition, but he quickly adjusted to the new reality. Judicial career Appointed to the Legislative Council in 1836, the following year he was named to the Court of King's Bench, his brother Alexander McLean taking his Stormont seat. From 1850 to 1856, he served in the Court of Common Pleas with Sir James Buchanan Macaulay and Robert Baldwin Sullivan. In the Extradition case of John Anderson, the fugitive slave, McLean argued that 'in administering the laws of a British province, I can never feel bound to recognize as law any enactment which can convert into chattels a very large number of the human race.' In 1862, he was appointed chief justice of the Court of Queen's Bench for Upper Canada. In 1863, he was appointed judge of the Court of Error and Appeal. For many years McLean had served as president of the St Andrew's Society of Toronto. He married Joan McPherson and they were the parents of seven children. He died in Toronto in 1865 and was honoured with a public funeral. The Upper Canada Law Journal wrote, Upon the bench was dignified and courteous; unsuspicious and utterly devoid of anything mean or petty in his own character, his conduct to others was always what he expected from them.

It was designed to force the Germans to divert forces attempting to relieve the 6th Army encircled in Stalingrad. The Soviet force captured its objective, the Luftwaffe's airfield at Tatsinskaya, destroying over 72 aircraft on the ground, but was left cut off and without supplies. Despite the loss of most of the tank corps during the ensuing breakout, the raid was a great operational victory. Background The Red Army had encircled the Wehrmacht's 6th Army in Stalingrad with Operation Uranus, begun on 19 November 1942. By the middle of December, the German relief effort, Operation Winter Storm, reached within 48 km of the encirclement ring, and the airlift trying to supply the encircled army was in full swing. In this situation, Stavka (Soviet High Command) decided to launch Operation Little Saturn, to encircle all of German Army Group A, by penetrating to the south and the coast of the Sea of Azov. The danger this operation created was so serious that the German command had to give up any hope of relieving the 6th Army and instead turned its attention to fighting the advancing Red Army formations, while simultaneously trying to move as many units as possible to the west. As a consequence of the threat, the most potent of the German divisions involved in the relief effort, 6th Panzer Division, was turned west, and ordered to first clear the raiding force from Tatsinskaya, and later to establish a new frontline towards the north of the airfield. With that decision, any hope of breaking through to 6th Army had vanished. The battle =Soviet planning= 24th Tank CorpsA tank corps was actually a division-size formation, but commanded by an officer with the rank of a corps commander. belonged to 3rd Guards Army, which was commanded by General D.D. Lelyushenko, which was a part of the Southwestern Front under the command of N.F. Vatutin. The corps was designated as the army's exploitation force, in line with the doctrine of Deep Battle. It was therefore not to be committed during the initial breaching of the tactical defenses of Axis forces in the sector, but would be committed once a breach in these defenses had been opened. The assault by 3rd Guards Army commenced during the morning of 16 December 1942. In order to accelerate the breaching of the Axis tactical defense by his rifle formations, Lelyushenko committed the other two tank corps available to him (17th and 25th Tank Corps) during the initial phase of the battle. 24th Tank Corps was ordered to commence its operation at 1130 hours on 17 December. At this stage, 17th and 25th Tank Corps had already reached the operational depth and were in the process of encircling Italian 8th Army and battling the forces of Army Detachment Hollidt. 25th Tank Corps later conducted a deep raid towards Morozovsk to the east of Tatsinskaya. The purpose of the two deep raids was to cut off the German formations conducting Operation Winterstorm, the relief attempt for the German 6th Army. =The raid= Detail of USMA Map showing the penetration routes of 24th and 25th Tank Corps (3GD arrow = 24th Tank Corps; Unlabeled arrow = 25th Tank Corps. The raid was aimed at the German Luftwaffe's airfield at Tatsinskaya, from which a major part of the Stalingrad relief airlift was conducted. On Christmas Eve, 24 December 1942, they captured the airfield with an attack from three sides. The airfield may not have received a warning, since flight operations were still going on. An eyewitness account by a Soviet officer describes the scene: > Our tank detachments unexpectedly broke into Tatsinski military airport. > First to penetrate enemy's territory was captain Nechaev's battalion. A > tough fight between tanks and enemy artillery began. Germans were shooting > grenades at the Russian (sic - Soviet) tanks and managed to blow up several > of them. However the Soviet tank crews broke the Nazi defense. After they > destroyed patrol forces, Russian (sic) soldiers started shooting German > pilots that rushed to their planes desperately hoping to save their > lives.from the Voice of Russia article 24th Tank Corps claimed the destruction of over 300 planes on the airfield, while German estimates were 72 were actually destroyed or almost 10% of the transport capacity of the Luftwaffe. The airfield defenses were quickly overrun, and while over 100 transport planes managed to escape, German losses were heavy. As the tanks were low on ammunition, many of the planes destroyed were rammed by the tanks. A number of planes were destroyed while still on railway cars on which they had arrived. Once the airfield was seized however, 24th Tank Corps was cut off, and found itself without supplies deep inside the German lines. Zhukov states the Corps \\"captured a trainload of disassembled aircraft\\", and \\"crushed\\" 200 German transport aircraft \\"ready to take off.\\" Then \\"for five whole days the armoured corps held Tatsinskaya, putting up fierce resistance to encircling enemy reserves.\\" =German reactionGlantz, D. 'From the Don to the Dnepr' pp. 68‚Äì71= Already while the battle for the airfield and the town were going on, it became clear to Badanov that he had been cut off, when march columns of his 24th Motorized Brigade were followed from the north by German forces. On 26 December, the last elements of 24th Motorized Brigade managed to break through the encirclement to join the main body of the corps. Field Marshal Erich von Manstein had meanwhile ordered the XLVIII Panzer Corps to move towards the deep penetrations the Red Army had achieved with the 11th Panzer Division and 6th Panzer Division. From 26 December, the two divisions had cut off completely the connection between 24th Tank Corps and 1st Guards Army. Towards the north, a mixed Kampfgruppe blocked the road against other Red Army formations that might come to the assistance of 24th Tank Corps. The German command also brought up the 579th Infantry Regiment of the 306th Infantry Division and three armoured trains: PZ 10a, 10b and 28.Wolfgang Sawodny, German Armored Trains on the Russian Front 1941-1944; Schiffer 2003 Together, these forces launched an attack with the aim of destroying 24th Tank Corps. STAVKA reacted by ordering the Front command to assist Badanov's force. The available units were 25th Tank Corps, which had been reduced to 25 tanks by heavy combat, and 1st Guards Mechanized Corps, which had incurred losses too. They were reinforced with infantry, but did not manage to break through to Tatsinskaya. This led to the need for Badanov and his surviving men to break out to escape destruction, and permission to do so was given on 28 December. Most of the mat√©riel and many men were lost during the break-out, but the damage to the Germans had been done. German forces engaged in the relief of Stalingrad had to be withdrawn to deal with the raiders, and many invaluable transport planes of the Luftwaffe had been destroyed, with their crews and ground personnel mostly killed. 24th Tank Corps claimed the destruction of 84 tanks, 106 guns, the killing of 12,000 Axis soldiers and the capture of almost 5,000 more in this operation. Analysis Despite the loss of most of the tank corps' heavy equipment, the raid was a great operational success. 24th Tank Corps operated up to 150 miles (240 km) from its supply base, but eventually had to rely on captured supplies to stay operational. The follow-on rifle troops were not mobile enough to keep up, allowing the Germans to cut off the connection between the raiding force and its base, and ultimately defeat the operational intent of cutting off a large part of the German forces in the region. Despite this, the raid had pushed a strong formation deep into the rear of mobile German formations, heavily damaged the Luftwaffe, and forced the German command to adapt its own operational plans. Previous raids had been by much weaker cavalry or airborne forces operating with partisans, and these had not been able to inflict as much damage. Much was learned by the Soviet command from the raid, and it probably gave further impetus to create the new tank armies as independent formations capable of conducting sustained operations deep in the enemy rear. The almost complete loss of the equipment and that of many of the personnel of 24th Tank Corps also brought home the truth that operating so deep behind enemy lines carried exceptional risks. Recognition STAVKA was quick in recognising the exceptional achievement of 24th Tank Corps. Major General Badanov became the first recipient of the newly created Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class, for this operation, and quickly went on to command 4th Tank Army later in the war, which he led in Operation Kutuzov in July 1943. From 1944 onwards, he commanded the Red Army Armoured School, and he rose to the rank of lieutenant-general. During the raid, 24th Tank Corps was renamed 2nd Guards Tank Corps and given the honorific title 'Tatsinskaya' to honour of its achievement. It later played a key role in the Battle of Prokhorovka, as well as many other important operations during the remainder of the war. Captain Nechaev, commander of the last tanks of the tank corps was made a posthumous Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions. Forces =Soviet Forces= 24th Tank Corps The strength of the corps was 90% of tanks provided for in the TO&E; for a total of 159 tanks, 50% of motor transport, and 70% of personnel. The Corps was supplied with two units of ammunition,one unit (also referred to as 'combat load') is defined as standard expenditure of the item in question during a day of combat. two units of fuel and lubricants, and five days of rations. * 24th Tank Corps (Major General of Tank Troops V.M.

Suunto SK-7 diving compass in aftermarket wrist mount with bungee straps Diver navigation, termed \\"underwater navigation\\" by scuba divers, is a set of techniques‚Äîincluding observing natural features, the use of a compass, and surface observations‚Äîthat divers use to navigate underwater. Free-divers do not spend enough time underwater for navigation to be important, and surface supplied divers are limited in the distance they can travel by the length of their umbilicals and are usually directed from the surface control point. On those occasions when they need to navigate they can use the same methods used by scuba divers. Although it is considered a basic skill, it is normally only taught to a limited degree as part of basic Open Water certification. Most North American diver training agencies only teach significant elements of underwater navigation as part of the Advanced Open Water Diver certification program. Underwater navigation is usually a core component of most, if not all, advanced recreational diver training. In the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course, it is one of the two mandatory skills (together with Deep diving) which must be taken alongside three elective skills. Training agencies promote underwater navigation as a skill (despite the fact that it is less popular than other recreational diving specialties) on the basis that it: * builds diver confidence * saves energy by minimising excess swimming * makes dive planning more effective * keeps dive buddies together * reduces air consumption Underwater compass navigation is a component of the scuba-based underwater sport, underwater orienteering. Techniques Underwater navigation in recreational diving is broadly split into two categories. Natural navigation techniques, and orienteering, which is navigation focused upon the use of an underwater magnetic compass. Natural navigation, sometimes known as pilotage, involves orienting by naturally observable phenomena, such as sunlight, water movement, bottom composition (for example, sand ripples run parallel to the direction of the wave front, which tends to run parallel to the shore), bottom contour and noise. Although natural navigation is taught on courses, developing the skills is generally more a matter of experience. Orienteering, or compass navigation, is a matter of training, practice and familiarity with the use of underwater compasses, combined with various techniques for reckoning distance underwater, including kick cycles (one complete upward and downward sweep of a kick), time, air consumption and occasionally by actual measurement. Kick cycles depend on the diver's finning technique and equipment, but are generally more reliable than time, which is critically dependent on speed, or air consumption, which is critically dependent on depth, work rate, diver fitness, and equipment drag. Techniques for direct measurement also vary, from the use of calibrated distance lines or surveyor's tape measures, to a mechanism like an impeller log, to pacing off the distance along the bottom with the arms. Many skilled underwater navigators use techniques from both of these categories in a seamless combination, using the compass to navigate between landmarks over longer distances and in poor visibility, while making use of the generic oceanographic indicators to help stay on course and as a check that there is no mistake with the bearing, and then recognising landmarks and using them with the remembered topography of a familiar site to confirm position. =Using natural features= Landmarks Recognisable topographical features may be remembered or noted and used identify position and direction. This is particularly useful if the visibility is sufficient to see the next landmark on the route before leaving the last. Landmarks are ordinarily considered permanent or semi-permanent features, such as ridges, boulders, wrecks or clumps of weed, but use can also be made of temporary marks such as anchor cables, shot lines, jackstays and guide lines. Depth and depth variation The slope of the bottom is often a reliable indicator of the direction toward the shore, particularly when the bottom is of soft or loose material, and is not broken up greatly by rocky outcrops. This information can be checked for reliability on a sufficiently detailed chart of the area. Contours of depth running roughly parallel to the coastline indicate a slope dipping directly away from the shore, and can be used to maintain a sense of distance and orientation relative to the shore. In some places where the bottom is composed of predominantly rocky outcrops the slope may be in any direction and is not a reliable indicator of direction. Angle of the sun, changes in light level If circumstances of depth and water clarity allow the position of the sun to produce sufficient variation in brightness, this may indicate the direction of the sun, and be used as a cue to orientation. The effect is greater if the sun is relatively low in the sky, the water is clean, the depth fairly shallow and the surface fairly smooth. In some circumstances the diver can look up at the surface, to see in which direction the land lies. These cues will not give any precise information about position, but will allow the diver to keep a mental picture of where he or she is and is going. Current, wave and surge direction Current direction can be useful as an orientation cue as long as the direction of the current is known. In rivers it tends to be fairly consistent and reliable, though localised eddies may occur. In the sea it may depend on weather conditions and local topography, as well as the state of the tide. In estuaries and harbours the currents will usually be predominantly tidal, so the state of the tide must be known, as the difference in direction between ebb and flow is usually about 180¬∞. Wave surge direction is essentially the same as wave direction, but may be felt at depths where the wave direction is no longer visible. It is useful if the offshore wave direction relative to the shore is known and does not change appreciably during the dive. In shallow water the wave crests will often be parallel to the shore. The important difference is that waves can be seen to travel in a definite direction, whereas surge is a back and forth motion, allowing a possible 180¬∞ error. Ripple patterns on a sand bottom A regular and distinct ripple pattern on a sand, mud or gravel bottom is an indication that it has been affected by wave action. The surge of the wave at depth causes the particles to be moved backwards and forwards in the direction the waves are travelling. This movement produces a ripple pattern on the bottom which is an indication of the wave direction on the surface. The ripple crests will be approximately parallel to the crests of the waves that formed them. It is however possible for the surface waves to change direction, and due to shorter wavelength, not reach the bottom to change the ripple pattern. When this is the case there will be no surge at the bottom. If there is a surge at the bottom, and the ripple crests are perpendicular the direction of the surge, then the wave crests will be parallel to the ripple crests. Ripple crests, like surge, may be interpreted with a 180¬∞ error. Dip and strike of bedrock Many rock formations have characteristic angles known as dip and strike. Dip is the slope of the strata from the horizontal, and strike is the general direction of the strata in the horizontal plane (very roughly). These characteristics will usually be similar in the rocks above and below the water in a locality, so they can be used to estimate direction. Ridges above and below water are often parallel, and gullies and valleys may well extend under water for considerable distances. Ecological variations Different areas may for a wide variety of reasons have different ecologies. A diver who is familiar with an area can use the diversity variations and patterns to provide orientation cues. There is often variation of ecological zoning with depth, but a diver is expected to be aware of the depth all the time anyway. In some places the seaward side of big rocks may have different species from the shoreward face because of the greater exposure to wave action. Sea fans and sponges are filter feeders, and may grow into a fan shape at right angles to the usual current or surge direction, to get the maximum volume of water flowing past them. =Using a compass= How a compass works The magnetic compass indicates the local direction of the ambient magnetic field, which is usually that of the Earth. This is usually a reliable and consistent feature and is very useful as a navigational aid as it is not affected by visibility, pressure, or the presence of water. An important concept is that the compass card should not turn, even though it appears to always ‚Äúswing‚Äù to magnetic north. The housing that holds the compass card turns around the card, which remains pointing in the same direction (Magnetic North) all the time. There are occasions when the card does turn, but this is when it has been stuck or the compass is turned over, and the card is unable to remain aligned with the magnetic field. True or geographic north True north is the geometrically accurate direction along the surface of the earth toward the North pole of the planet‚Äôs axis of rotation. The lines of longitude on maps are in true North/South directions. Magnetic north and variation The Earth has a magnetic field which is not quite in line with the geographic directions. The difference between the magnetic and true directions is known as Variation. It differs from place to place and changes with time. Large scale charts and maps will usually include a compass rose showing variation. Compass north and deviation The compass will indicate the magnetic field direction at the place where it happens to be at the time. If there are influences other than the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field, these may change the direction indicated by the compass. These effects are called deviation, and can be caused by a whole range of things. Any magnetic object or electrical current will have an influence, some more than others. The current in a dive computer is too small to affect the compass, even when quite near, but the hull of a ship or overhead power lines may make a difference even several meters away. It is difficult and often impossible to correct for all possible deviations, but it is worth checking a dive compass for deviation caused by dive equipment. It has been known for regulators to cause deviation, steel cylinders can cause deviation, and powerful lights may be a problem. A diver propulsion vehicle with an electric motor is also a potential problem for those who use them, though divers have been known to navigate adequately using compasses mounted on the handgrip of a DPV. A magnetic clip used to secure equipment to the diver's harness has a powerful magnet in both parts, and should not be used to hold the compass, as the part attached to the compass will produce a serious error. Deviation may be checked by comparing the compass bearing as measured with a known magnetic bearing measured by a compass with no deviation. Deviation may vary with different directions and for accurate work it is necessary to make up a table of deviations. This is done for ships, but for diving it is generally not worth the trouble. Bearings of one diver's compass may vary from those of another diver even if they have both been read correctly. The difference should not be large, but it can result in being off course and not finding something. A compass is a magnet, and will affect another compass nearby, so they can not be checked by putting them together. Dip The magnetic field of the earth is tilted from the horizontal. The angle is called dip and varies with place, so compasses can be corrected for different zones. This is a factory process. A compass made for the northern parts of the northern hemisphere will tilt badly in the southern hemisphere, in some cases to the extent that it will jam if held horizontal. =Using guidelines= A cave diver running a distance line into the overhead environment to facilitate a safe exit Also known as cave lines, distance lines, penetration lines and jackstays. These are permanent or temporary lines laid by divers to mark a route, particularly in caves, wrecks and other areas where the way out from an overhead environment may not be obvious. Guidelines are also useful in the event of silt out. Distance lines are wound on to a spool or a reel. The length of the distance line used is dependent on the plan for the dive. An open water diver using the distance line only for a surface marker buoy may only need 50 metres / 165 feet, whereas a cave diver may use multiple reels of lengths from 50 ft (15 m) to 1000+ ft (300 m). Reels for distance lines may have a locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment of the line and a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. Lines are used in open water to deploy surface marker buoys and decompression buoys and link the buoy on the surface to the submerged diver, or may be used to allow easy return navigation to a point such as a shotline or boat anchor. The material used for any given distance line will vary based on intended use, nylon being the material of choice for cave diving. A common line used is 2 mm (0.08 inch) polypropylene line when it does not matter if the line is buoyant. The use of guideline for navigation requires careful attention to laying and securing the line, line following, marking, referencing, positioning, teamwork, and communication. Line markers A line arrow on a cave's main guideline pointing to the exit thumbalt= Illustration showing typical cave line markers and how they are attached to the line for security. In cave (and occasionally wreck) diving, line markers are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly arrows), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a \\"jump\\" location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point in the cave where the diver is equidistant from two exits. Arrow direction can be identified by feel in low visibility. Non-directional markers (\\"cookies\\") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape does not provide a tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers. =Using surface control personnel= In some circumstances divers may be directed by their surface control personnel. This requires a method of communication between the surface team and the diver. Both voice communications and line signals may be used to direct the movement of the diver and to provide other information. Surface direction may be used in scuba diving when diving under ice or conducting an underwater search, and in surface supplied diving for both these purposes and at any other time that it is useful or convenient for the dive controller to direct the movement of the diver. Surface direction is most useful when the surface personnel have a better idea of where the diver is relative to where he or she needs to be than the diver has, which can happen when the visibility is poor, or when the diver is following a search pattern controlled by the surface controller. Surface navigation for diving Cocked hat on chart showing navigational error Surface applications for compass navigation include marking a position and finding the position using compass bearings. At least two position lines are required to fix a position, as only direction can be found using a compass. When two bearings are used a large angle between the bearings will minimize error. The angle should preferably be between 60 and 120 degrees, and near 90 degrees would be ideal. Three bearings are better as they will also give an indication of probable accuracy when plotted on a chart. The \\"cocked hat\\" or triangle where the lines intersect, shows the probable location of the position measured, and a small triangle indicates a small probable error. The angle between the three bearings should preferably be in the order of 60 or 120 degrees where available landmarks allow. In all cases landmarks should be as close to the diver as possible and spread over a large arc for best accuracy. Equipment Various pieces of equipment are available to assist divers navigating underwater. * Magnetic compasses, set either in a diver's console or wrist mounted. Various forms exist. * Scuba sextant, or Nav-finder, to enable a diver to plot an ongoing course during a dive. * Compass boards * Hand-held sonar * Cave and wreck reels and line * Jump spools Periodically reports are issued suggesting the development of underwater GPS technology, but no system is currently available on market. It is generally thought that the difficulty of locating satellite by signals from underwater at present is not capable of being overcome by existing technology. =Diving compasses= File:Diving wrist compass window.jpgDiving wrist compass showing window for reading bearing and course File:Wrist compass indirect reading.jpgSK-7 indirect reading diving wrist compass File:Comparison of wrist and console mount for diving compasses DSC06760.JPGComparison of wrist and console mount for diving compasses File:Reading a bearing from a wrist mount diving compass.jpgReading a bearing from a wrist mount diving compass File:Suunto wrist mount diving compass DSC06833.JPGSuunto indirect reading wrist mount diving compass File:Suunto wrist mount diving compass DSC06843.JPGSuunto direct reading wrist mount diving compass File:Ratio iX3M GPS in compass mode P9070454.jpgRatio iX3M GPS dive computer in compass mode File:Shearwater Perdix in compass mode P9070457.jpgShearwater Perdix dive computer in compass mode Construction The typical diving compass is made from a card with graduation in degrees, mounted on a pivot in a transparent housing filled with fluid which damps the movement and prevents pressure collapse of the housing. It may be wrist mounted, console mounted or carried some other way. It is desirable that the compass can operate accurately at significant tilt angles without sticking. On the card there is a magnet which will interact with the ambient magnetic field so as to align itself and the card with the field provided it is free to rotate. There will be other marks on the housing which are intended to be aligned with the direction of travel of the user, so the offset of the card to the housing will indicate the direction of the magnetic field and the orientation of the user. Important features of a diving compass are that it can easily be read in dim light, the card or needle does not easily jam if the housing is tilted slightly, and that it can be securely attached to the diver's arm or equipment and does not get lost. It is useful for any straps to be adjustable while wearing gloves, and any clips that may attached should be non-magnetic. The strap should be long enough to go round the diver's wrist over the diving suit glove, and if it is slightly elastic it will stay in place when the suit compresses. There may be a movable bezel which can be set to record a course and to help set a reciprocal course. There are also electronic compasses which can provide a digital or analogue display These are based on magnetometer technology. Several models of dive computer incorporate a compass function, but this may not be accessible at the same time as the primary decompression information, and may be limited in their precision of display information. Direct and Indirect reading compasses There are two ways in which a compass may be marked, which influence the way you would read them. These are known as direct reading compasses and indirect reading compasses. Both provide the same information to the same level of accuracy. Both types may have graduations on the card which can be read through a side window to give the bearing directly. The direct reading compass has graduations on the housing which read anti-clockwise round the face, with zero on the far side. The effect of this configuration is that if the housing is aligned with a direction, the north point of the card or needle will point directly towards the number representing the bearing. No further effort is needed on the part of the operator, you just find the number the arrow points at and read off the bearing. The bezel has no graduations, it is just a marker to align the card. The indirect reading compass has graduations on the bezel. These graduations are clockwise round the face, and the zero mark coincides with the notch. To take a bearing the compass must first be aligned with the direction, then the bezel must be turned so that the notch aligns with the north point of the card or needle, and the bearing can then be read at the far side of the compass. Electronic compasses Shearwater Perdix and Ratio iX3M GPS dive computers in compass mode Shearwater Perdix and Ratio iX3M GPS dive computers in compass mode with Suunto SK7 magnetic compass in close proximity Flux-gate compasses are built into several models of dive computer as an extra function. They may require calibration when powered up, but calibration usually lasts as long as the processor is running. They are usually insensitive to tilt as there are no moving parts to jam. The display varies, and may not be as intuitive as for a mechanical compass needle or card arrangement. They can often be calibrated to account for local deviation and give true direction. The nearby presence of a magnetic compass can cause large error, but they are not greatly affected by other electronic compasses, as can be seen from the images. Some digital cameras for underwater use also have a built in flux-gate compass (such as the Olympus TG series) which can be used for navigation as well as for recording the direction of a photograph.

The UniVBE driver was written by SciTech Software and is also available in their product called SciTech Display Doctor. The primary benefit is increased compatibility and performance with DOS games. Many video cards have sub-par implementations of the VESA standards, or no support at all. UNIVBE replaces the card's built-in support. Many DOS games include a version of UNIVBE because VESA issues were so widespread. According to SciTech Software Inc, SciTech Display Doctor is licensed by IBM as the native graphics driver solution for OS/2. History The software started out as The Universal VESA TSR (UNIVESA), written by Kendall Bennett. It was renamed to Universal VESA BIOS Extensions (UniVBE) in version 5, which supports VBE/Core 2.0, and no longer a freeware. In version 5.2, it was renamed to Scitech Display Doctor. However, UniVBE continued to be the name used for the actual driver. Version 6 included support of VBE/Core 3.0, VBE/SCI. Version 6.5 introduced the ability to use Scitech Display Doctor as wrapper video driver. Version 7 supports VESA/MCCS, and included Scitech GLDirect, an OpenGL emulator. This version was also ported to OS/2 and Linux (as version 1.0). However, the proposed product has never been widely available. Only pre-releases are available to the public. In the Windows SDD prerelease, it included DOS UniVBE driver 7.20 beta, the Scitech Nucleus Graphics driver, GLDirect 2.0 and 3.0 beta. SDD 7 was first released on OS/2 on the 28 February 2002, followed by a Windows beta on 1 March 2002. SciTech Display Doctor 7.1 marked the final release of SDD, which was available on OS/2, among other operating systems. However, the Scitech Nucleus Graphics engine lived on as SciTech SNAP (System Neutral Access Protocol) Graphics, SciTech SNAP DDC, and SciTech VBE Test Suite 8.0. Unlike UniVBE, SciTech SNAP Graphics is designed as fully accelerated binary compatible graphic device driver, rather than patching a GPU BIOS to be VESA-compliant. Display Doctor is no longer supported by SciTech Software. SciTech Display Doctor 5.3a, SciTech Display Doctor 6.53, and UniVBE 6.7 were available on their FTP site, but as of 4 October 2009, the FTP site no longer seems to be available; this seems to be related to the acquisition of SciTech Software by Alt Richmond Inc. in December 2008. One attempt to provide an alternative to SciTech's products was FreeBE/AF, but the last release was on 27 June 1999. Compatibility UniVBE requires a video card with at least 512 KB of memory. Although UniVBE has supported many controllers, the quality of VESA support decayed in newer incarnations, especially for owners with older hardware. In the case of newer GPUs, the video cards that use them have begun to incorporate rewritable firmware, which allows video card manufacturers to offer better VBE patches than SciTech can supply, especially for cards using Matrox processors. UniVBE does not add 16-colour screen modes or text modes, but offers an option to reuse those modes with a \\"pass through feature\\". However, the text mode pass through feature has been broken since the release of SDD 6. Matrox G-series video cards can only use video modes that utilize at most half of its memory. This is different from the Matrox Millennium, which was documented by SciTech as a hardware flaw.

As a player, Allen played as a forward from 1988 to 2004, making Premier League appearances for Queens Park Rangers. He also made Football League appearances for Colchester United, Grimsby Town, Peterborough United and Bristol Rovers. He represented England at under-21 level, earning eight caps and scoring two goals. Club career =Queens Park Rangers= Born in Harold Wood, London, Allen began his career with Queens Park Rangers, where he signed professionally in 1988 during the tenure of Jim Smith, although Smith was replaced by Trevor Francis midway through Allen's first professional season. Over the coming years, he went from strength to strength and began to see regular runs in the first-team. During the inaugural Premier League season in 1992‚Äì93 season, Allen played six times and scored twice, once in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Chelsea in January 1993 and the winner during a 2‚Äì1 win against Aston Villa at Loftus Road in May 1993. On 20 November 1993, he scored a hat-trick in a 3‚Äì0 win against Everton. Allen was eventually placed on the transfer list during the ill-fated 1995‚Äì96 season in which Rangers were relegated. In total, Allen scored 27 goals in 81 league games for QPR. =Charlton Athletic= First Division Charlton Athletic paid ¬£400,000 for Allen's services in March 1996. He scored six goals in 21 appearances in the league and League Cup in his first full season with the club but chances became harder to come by for Allen, as he made only 14 first-team appearances and could net only two goals during the 1997‚Äì98 season as Charlton were promoted to the Premier League. He then made only one appearance for the club in the 1998‚Äì99 season, and then joined Division Two side Colchester United in February 1999. This spelt the end of his time with Charlton, having scored nine goals in 40 league appearances. Colchester United loan Recruited by Colchester manager Mick Wadsworth, Allen made his debut for the U's in a 1‚Äì1 home draw with Reading on 27 February 1999, before being replaced by Steve Forbes after 68 minutes. He scored one goal while on loan with the club, a 40th-minute equaliser during a 2‚Äì2 draw with Oldham Athletic on 9 March. Allen made four appearances in total during his short stay at Layer Road. =Grimsby Town= Allen was placed on the transfer list at Charlton and transferred to Grimsby Town in the summer of 1999, who at the time plied their trade in the First Division under Alan Buckley. He scored nine goals in 36 games in all competitions in the 1999‚Äì2000 season but found himself limited to just 25 appearances in the 2000‚Äì01 season, being limited by injuries and only managing to score six goals. The 2001‚Äì02 season saw a return of 5 goals in 31 games, but his injury record and Grimsby's financial plight saw Allen released at the end of the season. He ended his Grimsby stay with 15 goals in 80 league games. =Peterborough United= Allen joined Peterborough United on trial in the summer of 2002, where he featured in a friendly against Rushden & Diamonds. However, he initially delayed joining the club and also refused offers from Bristol Rovers, Conference promotion hopefuls Doncaster Rovers and Cyprus- based club APOEL Nicosia. He then had an unsuccessful trial spell with Brighton & Hove Albion before signing for Peterborough on 29 August 2002. Allen scored three goals in 11 games for the Posh but Peterborough chairman Barry Fry confirmed that his short-term contract would not be renewed when it expired in December 2002. Having been linked with a move to Carlisle United. =Bristol Rovers= Bristol Rovers signed Allen in November 2002 from Peterborough following the expiry of his short-term contract. He made eight appearances in the league for the club and scored one goal against Cambridge United, as he was released at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. He also scored once in the FA Cup against Rochdale. =Hornchurch= Ambitious Isthmian League club Hornchurch signed Allen in September 2003 following trials with a number of clubs. He was one of a number of former professional players with Football League experience in a squad that knocked League side Darlington out of the FA Cup in 2003. However, with the club facing financial turmoil, Hornchurch began releasing players during the 2003‚Äì04 season, with Allen one of the squad members released. =Redbridge= Following his release from Hornchurch, Allen quickly joined Conference South side Ford United, who would later change name to become Redbridge. Having scored on his debut, his stint did not last long, and was subsequently released in July 2004, with club manager Craig Edwards stating that the club would prefer \\"to go with younger players\\" for the coming season and that there were financial implications. Allen then joined Billericay Town on trial, scoring in a pre-season friendly against Grays Athletic. International career Allen represented England at youth level and earned eight caps at under-21 level, where he scored twice. Coaching career After retiring from the game in 2004, Allen became a PE teacher and became an academy coach at Tottenham Hotspur, where he is currently running the under-15 side. Media career In addition to his coaching, Allen has worked in the media, providing co-commentary for Sky Sports Football First programme and also for radio coverage. Allen is also a regular co-commentator on BBC London 94.9, formerly alongside Phil Parry. Personal life Allen comes from a famous footballing family. He is the son of former Chelsea, Tottenham and QPR player and manager Les Allen. His brother is former England international Clive Allen and his nephew is former Barnet player Oliver Allen. His uncle, Dennis Allen played over 300 league games for Reading, and his cousin Martin Allen has managed a number of Football League clubs, alongside representing QPR and West Ham United. He is also related to Charlie Allen, Martin's son, who has played for Notts County and Gillingham. Paul Allen is also a cousin to Bradley, who made appearances for West Ham, Tottenham and Southampton amongst others.

Education Davoli obtained a history degree from Ricker College. As he considered his career options, Davoli began to study computer software by taking courses at Northeastern University. Career In 1981 he started working for Stone and Webster, and in 1986 he founded a database consulting firm, D & N Systems, with a partner, Dave Newsom. In January 1990, in Davoli's first successful high-tech exit, D & N Systems was acquired by Sybase a few months before that company went public.(03.30.2011) \\"Davoli, Robert Reuters Biography\\" Reuters.com, Retrieved 2011-09-26 D & N Systems changed its name to SQL Solutions, and Davoli stayed on to run it as a separate operating subsidiary. In 1992, Davoli was recruited to become CEO of Epoch Systems, a Sigma Partners portfolio company with a hierarchical storage management product.(07.24.2000) How a VC Does It BUSINESSWEEK ONLINE, Retrieved 2011-09-26 In 1993 Davoli sold Epoch Systems to EMC Corporation for $141 million. Davoli left Epoch / EMC about a year after the acquisition and started doing angel investing and advising local startups. At about this time, Charles Ferguson had founded Vermeer Technologies which was in the process of creating FrontPage, new and innovative software for creating web pages. Ferguson was seeking out the best advisors he could find in the area and was recommended to Davoli, who joined the Vermeer board as an independent director. Vermeer was purchased by Microsoft in January 1996 for $130 million. In 1995, he was recruited to join the Sigma team on a track to become a full partner in the firm. Once onboard at Sigma Partners, Davoli started funding some of the most successful technology companies to emerge in the Boston area in the mid to late 1990s. Many of these were founded by entrepreneurs who had emerged from the two companies of which he had been CEO: D & N Systems / SQL Solutions and from Epoch Systems. Since D & N Systems / SQL Solutions was an early strong player in the relational database field and Epoch Systems was in a similar position in hierarchical storage management, they were both natural breeding grounds from which strong startups would emerge. Incidentally, one of Davoli's greatest investment successes, Vignette Corporation, was founded by two ex-Epoch Systems employees, Ross Garber and Neil Webber, but had nothing to do with computer storage. Garber and Webber sought out Davoli to provide seed investment funds to start their company but did not even really know what they were going to do. With Davoli's blessing and some of Sigma's money, Vignette got started and developed into a fabulously successful investment in the new field of content management software. Davoli has invested in many other successful companies across the US, including Internet Security Systems, m-Qube, StorageNetworks, Octane Software, TRADEX and new investments Rave Wireless and Recycle Bank. He has been listed several times on Forbes magazine's exclusive \\"Midas\\" list and is seen as one of the top early-stage IT venture capitalists in the country. Personal life Davoli is married to Eileen McDonagh, a political science professor and together they have 2 sons. They reside in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Aside from business ventures, Davoli is a musician and plays country blues, country, and jazz guitar.

Description Close-up on flowers of Barbarea vulgaris This plant grows to about high, with a maximum of . The stem is ribbed and hairless, branched at the base. It has basal rosettes of shiny, dark green leaves. The basal leaves are stalked and lyre-pinnatifid, that is with a large terminal lobe and smaller lower lobes. The cauline leaves are smaller, ovate, toothed, or lobed. The flowers are borne in spring in dense terminal clusters above the foliage. They are long, with four bright yellow petals. The flowering period extends from about April through July. The fruit is a pod around . Chemical substances in this species include saponins,[references 6, 7, 8)] flavonoids, and glucosinolates. Taxonomy It was first published and described by William Aiton in his 'Hortus Kewensis' Vol.4 on page 109 in 1812. Some references mention Robert Brown (Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)), as the author but there are no mentions of his name in Hortus Kewensis, so Aiton is regarded as the correct author. It has various common names including 'bittercress', 'cressy-greens', 'herb-Barbaras', 'rocket cress', 'upland cress', 'English wintercress' and 'yellow rocket'. =Etymology= The genus name Barbarea derives from Saint Barbara, the patron saint of artillerymen and miners, as this plant in the past was used to soothe the wounds caused by explosions. The species Latin name vulgaris means ‚Äúcommon‚Äù.Allen J. Coombes Natural insect resistance and its potential use in agriculture Most B. vulgaris genotypes are naturally resistant to some insect species that are otherwise specialized on the crucifer family. In the case of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum, the resistance is caused by saponins. Glucosinolates such as glucobarbarin and glucobrassicin are used as a cue for egg-laying by female cabbage white butterflies such as Pieris rapae. Indeed, the larvae of this butterfly thrive well on this plant. Diamondback moth females are also stimulated by these chemicals, but the larvae die due to the content of saponins which are apparently not sensed by the moths. This phenomenon has been tested for biological insect control: B. vulgaris plants are placed in a field and attract much of the diamondback moth egg load. As the larvae die shortly after hatching, this kind of insect control has been named \\"dead-end trap cropping\\".Shelton, A. M. and B. A. Nault (2004) \\"Dead-end trap cropping: a technique to improve management of the diamondback moth,\\" Crop Protection 23: 497-503. Distribution Native to Eurasia and North Africa, it is naturalised in many parts of North America and New Zealand as a weed. =Range= It is found in temperate North Africa within Algeria and Tunisia. Also in Asia, within Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Caucasus, China (in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Jilin and Xinjiang), Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Japan (in the provinces Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Ryukyu Islands and Shikoku), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Siberia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Turkey. It is also found in tropical parts Asia, such as India (- in the provinces of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh), Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In eastern Europe, it is found within Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Ukraine. In middle Europe, it is in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. In northern Europe, in Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and United Kingdom. In southeastern Europe, within Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia. Lastly, it is found in southwestern Europe, it is found in France, Portugal and Spain. Habitat The plant prefers fresh or moist places, on roadsides, along rivers, in arable land, wastelands and docklands, or on the slopes and in ditches, at an altitude of above sea level. It also prefers to grow in siliceous, calcareous, sandy, alluvial and clay soils. Natural chemotypes with distinct ecology A pubescent type (the \\"P-type\\") has been described from southern Scandinavia and Russia. While this chemotype is rare in Scandinavia, it seems to be dominant in Russia according to the only survey made so far. This type has atypical chemistry and is devoid of resistance to the diamondback moth and the flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum. The P-type belongs morphologically to the variety B. vulgaris var. arcuata, but may also be identical to the subspecies originally described as Barbarea arcuata Rchb. ssp. pubescens N. Busch. In this context, the usual type of B. vulgaris var. arcuata is called the \\"G-type\\" (for glabrous (hairless) leaves). This type is reported to be dominant in Central Europe. On a genomic scale, more than 22.000 genes (89% of those tested) were found to have fixed differences between the two types. A chemotype with deviating glucosinolate content has been described from Western and Central Europe and named the \\"NAS-type\\" (because it is dominated by the glucosinolate glucoNASturtiin. This type has increased resistance to some specialized insects. In this context, the usual chemotype of B. vulgaris is called the \\"BAR\\" type (because it is dominated by glucoBARbarin). While the P-type and G-type differ in multiple genetic, chemical and morphological features, the NAS and BAR types seem to be a simple monogenic variation. For this reason, it has been suggested to refer to NAS and BAR forms (from the lowest botanical rank forma) and P- and G-types. Indeed, occasional NAS form plants in Central Europe were found to be G-type by a set of genetic markers. Uses The young leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.

(Joshua Reynolds) Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore, KT (27 August 1700 ‚Äì 5 July 1785), known as Lord Milsington to 1730, of Portmore House, Weybridge, Surrey, was a British Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1726 and 1730, when he succeeded to the peerage as Earl of Portmore. He subsequently became a Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords. He was a racehorse owner and was known as Beau Colyear for his conspicuous dress. Early life Colyear was the son of David Colyear, 1st Earl of Portmore and his wife Catherine Sedley, daughter of Sir Charles Sedley, 5th Baronet, MP, of Aylesford, Kent, and former mistress of James II.

It was the follow-up to their earlier 1984 EP Remote Luxury, and continued in a similar stylistic vein. The material from both five-track EPs was collected for international release on a compilation album, also called Remote Luxury, later in 1984. In 2001, EMI Australia released another compilation album, Sing-Songs//Remote Luxury//Persia (see also, Sing-Songs), which had remastered versions of all tracks from each of the three EPs, in their original running order.  Background  The Church released two extended plays in 1984, Remote Luxury in March and Persia in August, but only in Australia and New Zealand. Both EPs reached the Top 50 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) created their own charts in mid-1988. In 1992, Kent back-calculated chart positions for 1970‚Äì1974. Most of the tracks on Persia were written by lead vocalist Steve Kilbey. Compared to their third studio album, Seance, the atmosphere was lighter and less gloomy. The band's trademark guitar sound was complemented by the keyboards of Craig Hooper (from the Reels), who joined as an auxiliary touring member.  Reception  Evan Cater of AllMusic observed that \\"it manages to draw from the best qualities of neo-psycheldelia and pop-rock without succumbing to the genres' respective pitfalls. It is atmospheric without being spacey or formless, catchy without being superficial, and mellow without being lethargic\\".

Snakes are not just seen as deities, but as an animal species which should be respected, appeased and protected for multiple social, religious and ecological reasons.  Origin of Nagaradhane  Snakes have been associated with power, awe and respect in India. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu takes rest under the shade of the giant snake, Adisesha. Lord Shiva wears a snake Vasuki around his neck. It is difficult to trace the origin of Nagaradhane, though some clans among Tulu people claim to be of Nagavanshi descent, thus maybe snake worship was popularised by them. Though most rituals of snake worship are done by Brahmins, there is not a single Tuluva family that does not have Nagabana, Where Nagadevatha is worshiped according to Aliyasantana Lineage among Tuluva's. Nagamandala, Ashlesha Bali, Dakke Bali are different types of pooja done for snakes to appease them. All Tuluvas families: Mogaveera, Billava,Bunts, Maliyali Billava ,Tuluva Brahmins, Sapaliga/Sapalya, Madivala, Devadiga, Ganiga, Aachari, Parava / Nalkedaye,Koraga-Harijan, Tulu and Arebhashe Gowdas do worship Naga from ancient times in their respective Nagabana and Moolastanas. The snake worship rituals practiced in Tulu Nadu are quite unique and different from the other rituals. Snakes have their own snake shrines in a sacred grove known as Nagabana. The shrines have images of cobras carved of stones. Accordingly, nobody is allowed to chop the tree near the Nagabana. It is also believed that snakes, specifically the cobras, are not to be harmed or killed by anyone. If harmed, the individual has to perform a ritual to cleanse the sin of killing or harming the snake. The belief is that the individual who refuses to perform the ritual will be cursed by the snake for eternity. Concept of Moolastana among communities like Mogaveera have been majorly focussed on worshipping Naga related to their Aliyasantana Lineage based families. These Moolastanas by Mogaveeras are located consecutively on the sea front and also they had the tradition of organizing themselves into Grama Sabhas etc. formed Mogaveera Moola sthans on the basis of Bali/Bari which is Tuluva community equivalent of Gotra System. There are about 15 Bari in this community, each bari has a dedicated Moolastanas and few Bari has multiple Moolastanas across the Tulunadu. Each Moolastanas having annual celebrations and also Poojas during the Nagarapanchami when each house belongs to that particular Bali has to perform Pooja and Prayer of their Moola(Origin) Nagadevatha which their ancestors were related to. It can also be noted that in Tulu Nadu or the South Canara region in Karnataka, agriculture is predominant that too paddy is the main crop. In these fields snakes help in saving the crop from rodents. This can be a plausible reason for worship of snakes.  The ritual  Mandala drawn during ashleshabali at Belle Badagumane Moodubelle, Udupi There are two distinct rituals performed in reverence to the snake; Aashleshabali and Nagamandala. Of these, Nagamandala is the longer and more colourful of the two. Nagamandala depicts the divine union of male and female snakes. It is generally performed by two priests. The first priest, called patri, inhales the areca flower and becomes the male snake. The second priest, called Nagakannika or the female snake dances and swings around an elaborate serpent design drawn with natural colours on the sacred ground. The ritual is supplemented by playing an hour glass shaped instrument called as Dakke. The drawings in five different colours on the sacred ground are white (white mud), red (mix of lime powder and turmeric powder), green (green leaves powder), yellow (turmeric powder) and black (roasted and powdered paddy husk). Aashleshabali is the ritual performed on the day of Ashlesha Nakshatra (One of the 27 star as per vedic astrology). This is a unique ritual offering food to Sarpa devatas (Serpent Deities) and one of the Vedic solutions. It is a combination of Puja, Homa and Bali (food offering). Sarpa Devatas are invoked, worshipped and Bali is offered to each one of them. Sarpa sooktha japam is done. This is one of the ritual to appease the sarpa devatas and getting their blessings. The ritual, centered on the serpent design, continues till early in the morning. A similar ritual is found in Kerala and is known as Sarpam Thullal and Sarpam Kali. All communities of Tulu Nadu revere snakes.  Significance of Nagabanas  Nagabanas or the sacred groves are deemed to be the resting place of snakes. Cutting of trees or defacing the grove is considered as sacrilege. People are wary of the snake-bites and also wanted ecological preservation.

Its artistic director is Eamon Flack. Belvoir receives government support for its activities from the federal government through the Major Performing Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts and the state government through Create NSW. Many Australian actors who have later found wider success both locally and internationally such as Deborah Mailman, Cate Blanchett, Jacqueline McKenzie, Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham, Toby Schmitz, Judy Davis and Brendan Cowell have appeared in Belvoir productions. History Belvoir began, in 1984, with a unique action taken to save the Nimrod Theatre building. Two syndicates were established, 'Company A' with shares at $1000 each, which would own the building, and 'Company B', with shares at $10 each. 'Company B' aimed to stage theatre productions which were 'contemporary, politically sharp, hard-edged Australian theatre; to develop new forms of theatrical expression; work by and about Aboriginal Australians; work created by women; radical interpretations of the classics and work that is surprising, diverse and passionate'. Belvoir was officially launched in February 1985. Later that year, Signal Driver, written by Patrick White and directed by Neil Armfield, was 'the first play produced from the ground up by Belvoir'. In the lead roles were Kerry Walker and John Gaden. The theatre poster was designed by Martin Sharp. Armfield later recalled that White, who had purchased ten shares in the theatre, was its 'greatest shareholder'. From its foundation, Belvoir also instituted a 'parity pay policy' where all employees, from actors to stage hands, received the same hourly rate of pay. This policy, which continued from 1985 to the end of the 2011 season, prompted former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating to describe the Belvoir as 'Australia‚Äôs last commune'. In 2005, Belvoir temporarily moved to the Seymour Centre, Chippendale, while the theatre building underwent an $11.6 million renovation, and returned the following year. In January 2011, Ralph Myers took over from Neil Armfield as artistic director, stating 'There's a wealth of Australian playwriting and 2500 years of great plays to draw on, I don't see a need to import new plays from overseas.' In July 2014, Myers announced that he would be stepping down from his role at the end of the 2015 season. Myers said he had 'an \\"ideological\\" commitment to the regular turnover of artistic directorships'. Also in 2011, Belvoir appointed Simon Stone as the first director-in-residence. Stone's adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck, with the Belvoir, went on to win both Helpmann and Sydney Theatre Awards, in 2011, before being taken to Oslo for a three night performance as part of the 2012 International Ibsen Festival. Stone resigned from his position in 2013, and was replaced by dual directors-in-residence Adena Jacobs and Anne-Louise Sarks. In 2015 Myers was succeeded as Artistic Director by Eamon Flack. In 2019 Belvoir collected an unprecedented thirteen Helpmann Awards, including Best Play, Best New Australian Work and Best Direction of a Play. In the same year actors in Belvoir productions collected Best Female Actor in a Play, Best Female Actor in a Supporting Role in a Play, Best Male Actor in a Play and Best Male Actor in a Supporting Role in a Play. 2020 season *Every Brilliant Thing by Duncan Macmillan and Jonny Donahoe, directed by Kate Champion *Jesus Wants Me For a Sunbeam adapted from the Peter Goldsworthy novella by Steve Rodgers, directed by Darren Yap *Dance Nation by Clare Barron, directed by Imara Savage *A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf, adapted & directed by Carissa Licciardello *Escaped Alone by Caryl Churchill, directed by Anne-Louise Sarks *The Jungle and The Sea by S.

Life He was the elder son of Sir Alexander Robertson, of the family of Strowan, Perthshire, who settled in Holland, where he acquired a considerable property, and adopted the name of Colyear. Military career Colyear was commissioned into the Army of William of Orange in 1674, becoming Lieutenant-General of the Scots Brigade, the three Scottish regiments which had been fighting in the service of the Netherlands for many decades. He led the troops ashore when William landed at Torbay on 5 November 1688 and then served in most of William's Irish campaigns, being made Governor of Limerick in 1691. For his service in Ireland he was created Lord Portmore on 1 June 1699. In 1702, he obtained the rank of major-general, and on 27 February 1703 received the command of the Queen's Royal Regiment of Foot, later the 2nd Foot. On 13 April 1703, he was raised to the dignities of Earl of Portmore, Viscount of Milsington, and Lord Colyear. He took part in the War of Spanish Succession and participated in the Battle of C√°diz in 1702 and the Battle of Vigo Bay later that year. In 1710, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in Scotland, and in January 1711 was raised to the rank of general. In 1712, he served under the Duke of Ormonde in Flanders, and the same year he was named a member of the privy council and made a Knight of the Thistle. In August 1713, he was constituted Governor of Gibraltar, and in October of the same year he was chosen one of the sixteen representative peers of Scotland. When Gibraltar was besieged by the Spaniards in 1727, he embarked for that place to assume command, but on the approach of Admiral Wager with eleven ships the siege was raised. He died 2 January 1730. Family David Colyear had two sons (pictured) with Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester. He married Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, daughter of Sir Charles Sedley of Southfleet, Kent, and former mistress of James II.

Concepts Metz has proposed several new concepts for the analysis of military strategy and national security policy: *Psychological precision: the idea that modern militaries should be designed so that their operations attain desired psychological effects rather than simply hitting targets with precision. This concept was discussed in the 2001 \\"Year in Ideas\\" essay in the New York Times *Effects based planning for counterinsurgency: the idea that counterinsurgency planning should be determined by an array of psychological effects *Ethical asymmetry: the idea that normative differences between opponents in armed conflict is an important feature of 21st century warfare *Cultural asymmetry and counterinsurgency: the idea that the United States' approach to counterinsurgency support only works in nations with Western or Western-derived cultures *Personal versus strategic motives in insurgency: the idea that insurgencies where strategic motives‚Äîthose directed toward a desired political outcome‚Äîdominate differ in significant ways from ones where personal motives‚Äîthe desire for revenge, prestige, or material gain‚Äîdrive most insurgents. *New technological revolution for counterinsurgency: the idea that technology can, to some extent, substitute for labor in counterinsurgency, but not simply through the application of technology developed for conventional warfighting. A technological revolution for counterinsurgency (and other forms of asymmetric and irregular conflict) should be based on robotics (including micro- and nano-robotics), nonlethality, and psychotechnology. *\\"Metz threshold\\": counterinsurgency must achieve acceptable performance before political patience runs out, requiring an organizational learning response and the historical U.S. threshold for political patience is three yearsKilcullen, David.

The building lies in rione Ponte. History The current building was built on the foundations of the pre-existing church of Sant'Andrea de AquarizariisAquarizariis: \\"of the water carriers\\" on whom Rome depended after the aqueducts were broken. in 1482, commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV. The church was rededicated to the Virgin Mary to remember a miraculous bleeding of a Madonna image there in 1480. The author of the original design is not known, though Baccio Pontelli has been proposed. Cappella Chigi, Christ supported by Angels, bronze by Cosimo Fancelli, flanked by Saint Catherine (by Fancelli) and Saint Bernardino (by Ercole Ferrata). In 1656‚Äì67 Pope Alexander VII had the edifice restored by Pietro da Cortona, who also added the famous Baroque fa√ßade projecting from its concave wings: this, devised to simulate a theatrical set, has two orders and is entered by a semi-circular pronaos with paired Tuscan columns. The church presses forward almost to fill its tiny piazza; several houses had to be demolished by Pietro da Cortona to create even this miniature trapezoidal space. This newly formed piazza, focussed on the church facade even in its architectural detailing, had the additional benefits of facilitating the turning of coaches which had become so fashionable with the Roman nobility of the time and creating an ingenious unified ensemble of the church in its urban setting.Anthony Blunt, Guide to Baroque Rome, Granada, 1982, p. 103 The play of concave and convex forms at varying scales in and around the predominant main facade masks the neighbouring buildings, extends the apparent breadth of the facade and so increases the visual impact on the spectator physically confined by the small trapezoidal piazza. The monumental effect of the plasticity of forms, spatial layering and chiarascuro lighting effects belies the actual scale of this urban intervention. The inscription around the porch architrave is taken from Psalm 72: SUSCIPIANT MONTES PACEM POPULO ET COLLES IUSTITIAM (\\"The mountains shall bring peace to the people; and the hills, justice\\"). This reference to the 'mountains' of the coat of arms of the Chigi family, to which Alexander VII belonged, is presumably an allusion to the benefits of his papal reign. Oak leaf motifs, another Chigi family emblem, can also be found on the facade. On the upper facade, Cortona had the curved travertine panels cut to make grained matching patterns, in an unusual use of this particular material. Through the tall central window, the circular window of the 15th century church facade is visible. Cardinalatial Titulus The Church of Santa Maria della Pace was designated as a titulus for a Cardinal-Priest on 13 April 1587 by Pope Sixtus V.David Cheney, GCatholic Santa Maria della Pace.

Cortona articulated the interior of the dome with octagonal coffering and a series of ribs radiating from the lantern. This is an early example of combining these two forms of dome decoration and was employed by Gianlorenzo Bernini in his later churches at Ariccia and Castelgandolfo.A. Blunt, 1982, p. 104 Carlo Maderno designed the high altar (1614) to enframe the venerable icon of the Madonna and Child. =Chigi Chapel= Sibyls receiving angelic instruction by Raphael, 1514 Raphael began to fresco the Sibyls receiving angelic instruction (1514) above the arch of the Chigi Chapel, commissioned by Agostino Chigi, the papal banker.Unfinished by Raphael at his death (1520), the frescoes were completed based on his drawings by Sebastiano del Piombo. Raphael's assistant Timoteo Viti painted the four Prophets. The Deposition over the altar is by Cosimo Fancelli. =Cesi and Ponzetti Chapels= The second chapel on the right, the Cesi Chapel, was designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, and has a very fine Renaissance decoration on the external arch by Simone Mosca, as well as two small frescoes, the Creation of Eve and the Original Sin by Rosso Fiorentino. The first chapel on the left (Ponzetti Chapel) has noteworthy Renaissance frescoes by Baldassarre Peruzzi, who is better known as an architect. The second chapel has marble taken from the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. The tribune has paintings by Carlo Maratta, Peruzzi, Orazio Gentileschi, Francesco Albani and others. A main feature of the church and monastery complex is the Bramante cloister. Built in 1500‚Äì1504 for Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, it was the first work of Donato Bramante in the city. It has two levels: the first is articulated by shallow pilasters set against an arcade; the second also has pilasters set against an arcade which is vertically continuous with the lower storey, but with columns located in between each arch span.

They have long mandibles and have the ability to leap a few inches. They are large-eyed and active predators that hunt mainly in the early morning. The colonies are small and the difference between workers and queens is very slight. Subspecies *H. s. cruentatus (Smith, 1858) *H. s. taprobanae Forel, 1909 Habits A Harpegnathos beside a frog (Indosylvirana sp.) Unlike other ants, they are seen singly or in small groups and their colonies consist of very few individuals. They are also unusual amongst ants in that the queen-worker difference is very limited and some workers can mate and lay fertilized eggs just like the queen. These workers are termed gamergates. New colonies are founded independently by single queens, and on aging, they are replaced by several gamergates. The gamergates copulate with males from their own colonies, and being inbred, are related to the original founding queen. Colonies never undergo fission to form new colonies. Carrying a flower of Elaeocarpus to the nest entrance The workers limit the number of reproductives in the colony by policing new workers that try to lay eggs when an active queen or established gamergates are present. Workers use alarm pheromones that include 4-methyl-3-heptanone, 4-methyl-3-heptanol, and isopentyl isopentanoate. H. saltator, like many species of ants, produces 4-methyl-3-heptanone from mandibular glands. Dufour's gland secretions have been found to include a complex mixture of linear hydrocarbons from C15 to C25, with (Z)-9-tricosene being the main constituent, along with other minor constituents such as tetradecyl propionate and traces of tetradecyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. Both the secretions from the postpharyngeal glands and the cuticular wax include methyl esters of common fatty acids. Their leaps are accomplished by synchronized abduction of the middle and hind pairs of legs. They can jump up to 2 cm high and 10 cm far. These leaps are made not only to escape, but also to catch flying prey. The workers forage only during the cool hours of the morning and afternoon with a lull in activity during midday. The nest entrance is usually a low mound on the ground with the entrance surrounded by twigs and leaves. The nest entrance is closed by the ants in the evening, and is reopened in the day. The main chamber has a funnel-like opening in the antechamber, and this structure is believed to prevent flooding of the main chamber. A study of the genome and expressed genes found that the production of enzymes that slow aging (telomerase and sirtuin deacetylases) are increased when workers turn into queens. Description Possible colony lifecycles based on Peeters and Holldobler (1995) The following is the original description by T. C. Jerdon. A black-headed form with prey The following is the taxonomic description from C. T. Bingham's Fauna of British India (Hymenoptera ‚Äì Volume 2): * Worker: Head, thorax and pedicel ferruginous red, closely and rather coarsely punctured, granulated; abdomen black, shining, not granulated, with punctures finer and more scattered ; mandibles, antennae, and legs yellow; the whole insect covered with short, sparse, erect pale hairs, and a minute, fine, sericeous shining pubescence on the mandibles, head, antennae, thorax, and legs, visible only in certain lights. * Queen: Similar to the worker; the ocelli placed very low down, almost in the middle of the front of the head. * Male: Mandibles short, triangular, rather wide, but not elongated. Head somewhat longer than broad, strongly constricted behind the eyes and up to the occipital articulation. Concavity in front shorter and broader than in D. venator. Posterior face of the metanotum strongly margined. First abdominal segment pyriform elongated as in D. venator. No constriction between the basal two segments. A small median carina is behind the occiput. Smooth and shining. Metanotum, pedicel and a part of the sides of the mesonotum coarsely rugose. Some foveae or obsolete striae on the rest of the thorax.

Established by the Government of New South Wales ostensibly to investigate mental health services in the state, the royal commission came about only after prominent Sydney radio and television shows pressured the newly elected Health Minister, Peter Collins, to make good his promises for a Royal Commission. Originally, its prime focus was to have been psychosurgery at the NSW Neuropsychiatric Institute. Following media pressure it focused more on the Deep Sleep Therapy of Dr Harry Bailey, the director, from 1963 to 1979, of the state-funded Neuropsychiatric Institute and then the Chelmsford Private Hospital, a private psychiatric institution in Sydney. According to the National Institute of Health, \\"deep sleep was toxic coma for two to eight weeks in patients with intractable psychiatric conditions; about 40 deaths were associated with the treatment\\". Background Bailey committed suicide in September 1985 in response to the ongoing media exposure of his practices as well as disquiet from among the ranks of other health professionals. He wrote in his suicide note: \\"Let it be known that the Scientologists and the forces of madness have won\\".The Melbourne Age, 22 April 1991. However, during his period of time being a Director of Chelmsford, there were serious allegations of cover up by colleagues and serious failings of the State to investigate. The Royal Commission said in its 4000-page report that patients at Chelmsford received large doses of barbiturates which put them in comas for up to two weeks. Dr. Harry Bailey described this mental state as a \\"holiday\\". He said that the drugs \\"have very beautiful chemicals that allows us to produce very stylish results in people‚Äôs mental functions\\". Bailey used DST for a variety of conditions, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Patients were put to sleep an put in a short-term coma-like state for up to two weeks or longer. While the patients were supposed to be woken up for toileting and daily nursing care, they were kept unconscious for at least two weeks. Deep Sleep Therapy (DST) made its first appearance in the media in November 1967 in the Sydney Morning Herald. The newspaper reported concerns about the excessive amount of drugs given to Ronald Carter, who was then 23 years old. He died in May 1967 while under deep sleep therapy. The drugs used in deep sleep therapy include Tuinal, Neulactil, Sodium Amytal, Placidyl and Serenace. All of these substances were restricted under Schedule 4 of the Poisons Advisory Committee. Dr. Harry Bailey used DST for a variety of conditions, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Patients were put to sleep an put in a short-term coma-like state for up to two weeks or longer. While the patients were supposed to be woken up for toileting and daily nursing care, they were kept unconscious for two weeks. 25 patients died from Deep Sleep Therapy and hundreds suffered side effects. The Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) investigated Deep Sleep Therapy with an intense focus, leading to the Royal Commission.

They are preceded by Crystals of Arborea, which is sometimes nicknamed Ishar 0. The games are all played in first-person perspective, with all but Crystals of Arborea allowing the player to direct a group of five characters, each with a selectable race, gender, and class.  Crystals of Arborea  Crystals of Arborea was published by Silmarils in 1991. It precedes Ishar both chronologically and by its gameplay. Morgoth, the main antagonist of Crystals of Arborea, is the father of Krogh, the one of Ishar: Legend of the Fortress. Moreover, most of the heroes of the game, Jarel's companions, can be met in Ishar or even in Ishar 2.  Ishar: Legend of the Fortress  The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, Ishar, whose name means \\"unknown\\" in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel. Most of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one. This opus was the only one of the series that had gold removed from the party each time the player saved. The band Summoning used the cover art of the game for their album Minas Morgul.  Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom  Ishar 2 was published in 1993 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. In Ishar 2, the player starts with the character of Zubaran, who is the new lord of Ishar. He receives a vision that tells him to defeat the sorcerer Shandar. It is also possible to import a party of characters from the first Ishar. The game now takes place on an archipelago, each island bearing the name of one of Jarel's companions. Each island also features a different type of landscape: Irvan's island is covered with swamps, Akeer's and Otbar's are underground complexes, Zach's island is covered by a city, Jon's is mountainous, and Thorm's has treetop gangways in a forest. This game has a combat system that's more ergonomic than in the first Ishar, and a day-night cycle in which shops are closed at night and the nightclub is closed by day. It also adds a bank. Saving the game does not remove gold from the player any more.  Ishar 3: The Seven Gates of Infinity  Ishar 3 was published in 1994. The player starts with Zubaran or imports characters from another game of the series, and has to hunt the dragon of Sith. In order to do that, he needs to cross a series of gates, each one sending him to a different time period. Each period, like the islands of Ishar 2, has its own climate and type of landscape.  Ishar 4: Ishar Genesis  A fourth game in the series, Ishar 4, was in development and announced in 1995 for the Atari Jaguar CD under the working title Ishar Genesis and was intended for a December 1995 release but development was discontinued for unknown reasons. Former Silmarils programmer Cyril Cogordan stated that ideas created for the unreleased fourth installment were later implemented in Asghan: The Dragon Slayer, released three years later.

On February 26, 1814, Congress divided the duties of the Committee of Ways and Means and transferred that part relating to the examination of past expenditures to a standing Committee on Public Expenditures. In 1816, the House initiated an organizational change that provided a means of continuously and consistently following the operations of the various Departments in the Executive branch and scrutinizing their expenditures. On February 28, 1816, Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia proposed the appointment of six standing committees to examine the accounts and expenditures of the State, Treasury, War, Navy, Post Office Departments and those related to the construction and maintenance of public buildings.Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States, 14th Congress, 1st session, February 28, 1816, pp. 411-413 The committees were created on March 30, 1816,Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States, 14th Congress, 1st session, March 30, 1816, pp. 550-551 with Stevenson Archer (Maryland), Wilson Lumpkin (Georgia), and Benjamin Huger (South Carolina) as the first members of the Committee on Expenditures in the Navy Department.

Beyond its vintage look, the Persephone allies sensors technology and digital controls to a pure analogue generation of sound. With its analogue oscillator, the Persephone can generate notes with a range of 10 octaves, which goes from a deep and resonant cello tone to a nearly human voice. And on the highest pitches, it can reach very high frequencies. Its ribbon virtual control surface allows all kind of glissando a Theremin or an Ondes Martenot would allow. The Persephone's ribbon can be scaled from 1, 2, 5 to 10 octaves. The ribbon responds to changes in voltage or resistance caused by changing the finger position along its surface. The Persephone ribbon controller is also able to record pressure or velocity. The ribbon is a linear potentiometer that generates different control voltages depending on where it is touched. Thus, the modern ribbon on the Persephone replaces the nickel-chrome resistance wire used as a variable resistor to control the pitch of the trautonium1. These changes in voltage are applied to the voltage-controlled oscillator and the filter. The voltage fluctuations are also translated into binary data and used to control digital modulation. With MIDI in/out and CV, it can also be used as a MIDI controller.

The album marked the first occasion when group compositions dominated one of the band's releases. Steve Kilbey has said: \\"The demo situation was getting to us - me writing the songs on my eight-track and bringing them along to the band. It sounded too stiff. We'd reached this new energy level on stage which by far superseded anything we'd ever recorded, so we knew the only way to get sounding like that (on record) was for the whole band to write together.\\" Lesley Sly, \\"Heyday: The Church\\" - interview with Steve Kilbey and Peter Koppes, Sonics (May/June 1986), 8-12, 13. Robert Dean Lurie notes that \\"As the band began cutting the album at Studios 301, it became apparent that there had been a dramatic change in Steve's voice. Perhaps it was the extended break from performing, or abstaining from drugs, or the hours of yoga; in any case, Steve's singing was now much more relaxed and warm, and he possessed a wider, more dynamic range. For years, critics had pointed to Steve's sometimes dour voice as the Church's weak point. Suddenly, during these new recording sessions, his distinctive vocals became one of the band's greatest strengths ‚Äì its signature, in fact. In addition to singing all the leads, Steve also tracked multiple harmony parts for each song, sometimes singing an entire octave higher than his normal register.\\" Robert Dean Lurie, No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church. Portland, OR: Verse Chrus press, 2009, 151-52. Although most of the keyboards utilised on previous recordings had been stripped back, the album saw a greater amount of embellishment with the addition of strings and brass. While at the time Heyday featured more focus on the guitar interplay than anything since The Blurred Crusade, solos had been cut to a bare minimum. Rolling Stone said the album \\"suggest[s] a more electrified version of Love's '68 orchestral rock classic Forever Changes.\\" Despite some critics and followers taking issue with the brash horns on some songs, the album regularly lists among the fan base's (and even band members') favourites. Tracks such as \\"Myrrh\\" and \\"Tantalized\\" have been featured in live shows even up to present day. It is notable for being, to date, the last album by the group to feature a printed lyric sheet - Kilbey has declined to include lyrics with any subsequent albums. Despite the increased amount of studio collaboration on Heyday between the members, while the band was on tour in April 1986 to support the album, Willson-Piper suddenly quit mid-tour after rising in-band tensions. On 10 July, The Church performed as a three-piece in Hamburg, Germany; Willson-Piper returned within a week after Kilbey agreed that future releases would contain more group efforts. In 2002 the album was remastered and reissued by EMI Australia, with a bonus disc including promo videos for \\"Already Yesterday\\", \\"Tantalized\\" and \\"Columbus\\". In 2010, Second Motion Records released a single-disc remaster as part of their 30th Anniversary Series.

It was established in 1879 by Queen Victoria after the events of \\"Tooth and Claw\\". Its prime directive is to defend Earth against supernatural and extraterrestrial threats. It is later revealed in \\"Army of Ghosts\\" that the Torchwood Institute has begun to use their findings to restore the British Empire to its former glory. To those ends, the organisation started to acquire and reverse engineer alien technology. Within Torchwood an unofficial slogan evolved: \\"If it's alien, it's ours\\". According to one base director, Yvonne Hartman, its nationalist attitude includes refusing to use metric units. While described as \\"beyond the UN\\", the Torchwood Institute is seen to cooperate with UNIT to some extent. There appears to have been some rapport with the Prime Minister, although it is noted by Harriet Jones in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" that she is not meant to know the existence of Torchwood. Those who have come in contact with Torchwood primarily believe it to be a special forces team. They appear to maintain this illusion by using false witnesses, or by sectioning any journalists who threaten to expose the truth, and via the use of memory-altering drugs. Following a major incident which led to the destruction of Torchwood One, Jack Harkness rebuilds Torchwood to become less confrontational and more secretive in honour of the Doctor. Creation The name \\"Torchwood\\" is an anagram of \\"Doctor Who\\", with which tapes of series 1 of the revived Doctor Who TV series were labelled to prevent the footage from being leaked. While writing Doctor Who series 2, head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies established the word \\"Torchwood\\"‚Äîwhich was the name of an institute previously mentioned in the episode \\"Bad Wolf\\" (2005)‚Äîin his script for the 2005 Christmas Special \\"The Christmas Invasion\\", both as a motif of the series similar to the \\"Bad Wolf\\" motif in series 1, and as a lead-in to the Torchwood spin-off series Davies was planning for BBC Three. Torchwood was conceived by Davies as a ruthless but professional organisation helmed by a \\"soulless\\" woman based on someone Davies had met. He originally based the Torchwood seen in the Doctor Who series 2 episodes \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\" (both aired 2006) over a rift in Cardiff introduced in \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" (2005), but while developing the Torchwood spin-off series over the summer of 2005, he relocated the Torchwood seen in \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\" to London, while maintaining the existence of a Cardiff branch for the Torchwood series he was preparing. Fictional history =1879‚Äì2006= The Institute was founded by Queen Victoria in 1879, following the events of the Doctor Who episode \\"Tooth and Claw\\". While staying at Torchwood House, the Scottish estate of Sir Robert MacLeish, the Queen (Pauline Collins) was attacked by a werewolf, in reality an alien intelligence that planned to infect her with its consciousness by biting her. The werewolf was ultimately dispatched, thanks to the efforts of the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and the sacrifice of Sir Robert. Having discovered that \\"Great Britain had enemies beyond imagination,\\" Victoria decided to establish the Torchwood Institute in memory of Sir Robert (who lived on the Torchwood Estate). She also decided that the Doctor was dangerous and declared that if he ever returned (against her orders to leave and never return), Torchwood would be waiting. The Doctor's name was written into the Torchwood Foundation's charter as an enemy of the Crown. Her Majesty states in the Torchwood Charter 31 December 1879 that \\"Torchwood is also to administer to the Government thereof in our name, and generally to act in our name and on our behalf, subject to such orders and regulations as Torchwood shall, from time to time, receive from us through one of our Principal Secretaries of State\\". In 1882, Victoria expanded Torchwood's role to include the acquisition of alien technology, creating the policy that \\"if it's alien, it's ours\\". In 1888, Victoria reiterated the secrecy policy of the Torchwood Institute, protecting her subjects from the \\"evils that [Torchwood] fight[s]\\". Not long after the foundation of the Institute, a spacetime rift was identified in Cardiff and as a result, a smaller branch of the Institute (Torchwood Three) was formed there to monitor and exploit the Rift. Alice Guppy and Emily Holroyd in 1899 As shown in the episode \\"Fragments\\", Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) came to the attention of Torchwood Three in 1899, due to visiting the rift and talking about the Doctor. He was coerced into working for the organisation. Captured by two Torchwood agents‚ÄîAlice Guppy (Amy Manson) and Emily Holroyd (Heather Craney)‚ÄìJack was subjected to torture and interrogation regarding the Doctor before being put to work for the Institute as a freelance agent for over a century. A few years later (1901), whilst this Harkness was in Torchwood's employ, Guppy and Charles Gaskell (Cornelius Macarthy) found and disinterred another Harkness on a different timeline, who instructs them to immediately \\"cryofreeze\\" and store him for 107 years to avoid him meeting his other self ‚Äì they comply with his request. Old Torchwood Logo The activities of the Torchwood Institute during the 20th century are, for the most part, yet to be revealed. It is known that the organisation \\"flourished down the decades, becoming stronger\\" and grew \\"more arrogant.\\" Some insights into the World War I-era organisation (such as their progressive policies regarding women's civil rights) were offered in Torchwood episode \\"To the Last Man\\". Torchwood Three's progressive stance is also shown in the episode \\"Exit Wounds\\", where a black Torchwood member (possibly leader) called Charles Gaskell is shown in 1901, an era of widespread racial prejudice. Other events in the 20th century have attributable dates. At the time of the British Raj, Torchwood also maintained a branch in Delhi. This was shut down in 1924, Torchwood anticipating Indian independence; agent Jack Harkness was sent to recover all their artifacts. In 1965, agent Jack Harkness was elected on behalf of the Institute (along with representatives of different government agencies) to facilitate the sacrifice of twelve children to aliens known as the 456 to save the planet at large. In 1983, Torchwood became the sole proprietor of H. C. Clements, a security firm. Torchwood One owned a holding facility which was then abandoned in 1995. In 1996 a \\"Jathaa sunglider\\" flew into British airspace and was shot down by Torchwood. From its remains, an energy weapon was installed in London and later onto the UNIT aircraft carrier Valiant. On New Year's Eve 1999, the then-leader of Torchwood Three (named \\"Alex Hopkins\\" by the Torchwood website) killed all the staff apart from Jack, ending with himself. He claimed that he was \\"saving\\" them, as the 21st century was when it all changed and humanity was not ready. Left in charge of Torchwood Three, Jack began severing the links with Torchwood One and their more aggressive policy on extraterrestrial life. Over the next few years, Jack recruited his own team; Suzie Costello (Indira Varma), Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and Dr. Owen Harper (Burn Gorman). By 2006, the existence of Torchwood was apparently a secret known only to the British military and police. Knowledge of Torchwood was supposedly kept even from Prime Minister Harriet Jones (Penelope Wilton) and the UN. However, Jones did know about its existence anyway, and ordered Major Richard Blake (Chu Omambala) of UNIT to prepare Torchwood for the impending arrival of the Sycorax on Christmas Day. On the command of Prime Minister Harriet Jones, Torchwood used the Jathaa sunglider weapon to destroy a Sycorax ship on Christmas Day 2006. =2007‚Äì2012= The Doctor discovered the existence of Torchwood in the 2006 series' two-part finale, \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\" set in 2007. At this time, Torchwood operated software which blocked access to Internet searches about UFO activity (\\"School Reunion\\"). The TARDISODE for \\"Army of Ghosts\\" showed Torchwood agents abducting a journalist who was investigating the Institute and arranging to admit him to a psychiatric institution. While investigating the manifestation of \\"ghosts\\" on Earth, the Doctor traced their origin back to Torchwood Tower, known publicly as One Canada Square, where Yvonne Hartman (Tracy-Ann Oberman) placed the Doctor in custody and confiscated the TARDIS. To Torchwood, the Doctor was a source of vast information and familiarity with alien technology which they could exploit to further the organisation's aims. The interior of the Torchwood Tower, as seen in \\"Army of Ghosts\\". Torchwood Tower had been built to reach a spatial breach 660 feet above sea level. Unbeknownst to Torchwood, the breach had been caused by the entrance into the universe of a \\"void ship\\", a vessel designed to travel through the void between parallel universes. Torchwood had been conducting experiments on the breach, in an attempt to harness its energy and reduce Britain's reliance on Middle Eastern oil, but these experiments had caused the breach to widen. The \\"ghosts\\" turned out to be Cybermen from an alternate universe, which were using the widening breach to travel between universes. A small advance force of Cybermen infiltrated Torchwood, \\"upgrading\\" or subverting Torchwood personnel, before eventually seizing control and opening the breach wide enough for ghost-like creatures around the world to manifest fully as millions of Cybermen. However, the void ship had nothing to do with the Cybermen and had in fact been created by the Daleks (voiced by Nicholas Briggs), four of whom had used it to escape the Time War. Caught between warring Daleks and Cybermen, many Torchwood workers were either killed or \\"upgraded\\" to Cybermen (including Hartman herself‚Äîalthough she retained some semblance of her identity). In the wake of these events, referred to as the \\"Battle of Canary Wharf\\", the Institute feels it must \\"learn by heart\\" a lesson about its own arrogance. It was later revealed that the London branch of Torchwood, called Torchwood One, lost 796 members of staff and was ultimately ordered to close by Queen Elizabeth II. The threat is ended when the Doctor and Rose Tyler use Torchwood One's equipment to banish the Daleks and Cybermen into the Void between worlds and end the invasion. In \\"The Runaway Bride\\", it is revealed that the London-based security firm \\"H. C. Clements\\" (which employed secretary Donna Noble (Catherine Tate), who inexplicably materialised in the TARDIS just as she was about to get married) was a front company for the Torchwood Institute. On a restricted basement level of the company situated beneath the Thames Barrier was a secret laboratory which the Institute used to recreate ancient \\"Huon particles\\". Over a period of months, H. C. Clements' Human Resources Manager, Lance Bennett (Don Gilet), had courted and poisoned Donna with Huon particles, intending to sacrifice her to the Empress of the Racnoss (Sarah Parish). It would appear that Lance was not acting on behalf of the Institute, and the lab was in disuse since the Battle of Canary Wharf and the Queen's official closure of Torchwood One. In 2007, following Torchwood One's closure, Torchwood Three leader Captain Jack Harkness allows former Torchwood One researcher Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) to join his team and is no longer working under the authority of the headquarters in London; he is the de facto leader of the entire organisation. This team worked together until later the same year, when the hiring of policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) coincided with the suicide of second-in-command Suzie Costello. In \\"The Sound of Drums\\", Jack indicates to the Doctor that with Torchwood One gone, fewer than ten staff remain (between Wales and Scotland). He mentions that he rebuilt the Institute \\"in the Doctor's honour\\", with a new regime and a less aggressive stance. Outside the Institute's small workforce, journalists such as Vivien Rook (Nichola McAuliffe) of The Sunday Mirror investigate controversial figures such as Harold Saxon (John Simm) on behalf of the Institute. Saxon sent Torchwood Three on a 'wild goose chase' to the Himalayas to prevent them from helping Jack or the Doctor. Torchwood Three later fought against the Daleks in their second invasion of Earth. Torchwood used the rift to make contact with the Doctor. Although they were incapacitated in the main battle, thanks to a time lock created by Tosh some time earlier that prevented them from escaping the Hub, Torchwood Three made a contribution to the Earth's return to the solar system by putting a lasso of temporal energy around the Earth with the help of K-9 (voiced by John Leeson) and Mr Smith (voiced by Alexander Armstrong), allowing the planet to be towed by the TARDIS. Sometime prior to the 456 incident, Torchwood Two had closed down. Torchwood Three was the only force on Earth posed to combat the threat of the 456 invasion. However, Home Office Permanent Secretary John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi) ordered the assassination of remaining Torchwood agents Harkness, Cooper and Jones to cover up the UK's history with the aliens. On receiving communication from the 456, the government orders the assassination of all Torchwood Three staff to stop them interfering with the operation. While they evade assassination, Jones dies in the line of duty, and Harkness abandons the planet after having to kill his grandson. According to Joshua Naismith (David Harewood) in \\"The End of Time\\", the Institute is no longer functional in December 2009. For a time, Torchwood is nothing more than a legend; Harkness and Cooper essentially re-establish the Institute with some Central Intelligence Agency agents in Torchwood: Miracle Day (2011), although new member Rex Matheson notes at one point that 'Torchwood' is essentially just a name given their current renegade status. In the Doctor Who episode \\"Fear Her\\", set in 2012, Torchwood is public enough to be mentioned in a television broadcast during the London 2012 Olympics. =The future= In the future seen in the novel Twilight Streets, Torchwood is no longer a private organisation and has branches all across the Torchwood Empire. At the center of the organisation's new image is the Cardiff branch, a new building in the center of the city. The Rift Manipulator has been moved to the new building and has been plugged into a permanently comatose Jack Harkness, whose immortality allows the Rift to be held open safely, thus allowing two-way travel. The radio drama \\"Asylum\\" also suggests that Torchwood might gain control over the Rift in the near future, using it to send a half- alien girl back to the present day. Torchwood was also mentioned in the Doctor Who episode \\"Bad Wolf\\" when Rose is forced to play on a game show and one of the questions is about the remains of a Torchwood location. In the 42nd century, the Torchwood Archives sent a group of explorers to investigate a mysterious power source that kept a planet in stable orbit around a black hole. By the 2002nd century, the Great Cobalt Pyramid has been built on the ruins of the Torchwood Institute. =Parallel universe= In \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\", a parallel Earth Torchwood Institute is referred to. It is public enough for a survey carried out by it to be reported in a news item, and for someone to be publicly asked about their work there. Prior to \\"Army of Ghosts\\", a group led by Pete Tyler (and including Jake Simmonds and Mickey Smith), which worked for the alternate world's People's Republic, took over the parallel Earth Torchwood. The people of this alternate universe discovered what was going on at Torchwood and it became a re-developed organisation run in full view of the public. In \\"Doomsday\\", it is revealed that the parallel Earth Torchwood had also been conducting experiments on the spatial breach, which led (between \\"The Age of Steel\\" and \\"Army of Ghosts\\") to it being infiltrated by the Cybermen, who used the breach to travel to Rose's universe. Following the events of \\"Doomsday\\", Rose Tyler, confined to the alternate world, goes on to work for the reformed organisation. From this accelerated parallel universe, Rose's Torchwood becomes aware of \\"the darkness\\" causing the stars to go out, mentioned in the episode \\"Journey's End\\", and returns in \\"Turn Left\\" and \\"The Stolen Earth\\" to defend London and find the Doctor in his reality. She is followed shortly by Mickey and Jackie, armed with Torchwood- developed anti-Dalek weaponry, in \\"Journey's End\\". Divisions of Torchwood =Torchwood One, London = One Canada Square, the hidden location of Torchwood One. Torchwood One was Torchwood's head office and operated out of Torchwood Tower, located within One Canada Square, the tallest of the three Canary Wharf skyscrapers, although it carried out operations across London, including beneath the Thames Barrier, and through front organisations such as \\"H. C. Clements\\". To those that have come in contact with Torchwood, they are primarily believed to be a special forces team. The beam which destroyed the Sycorax ship was fired from five different locations around London, suggesting a number of properties are owned by Torchwood One in the area. The tower installations were destroyed during the events of \\"Doomsday\\". According to the Torchwood website, there were 823 members of staff, of which only 27 were known to have survived. In the wake of the \\"Battle of Canary Wharf\\", Her Majesty ordered the immediate closure of Torchwood One. Some of the notable employees included: * Yvonne Hartman (director) * Dr. Rajesh Singh (scientist) * \\"Samuel\\" (Mickey Smith) (scientist)* * Lisa Hallett * Adeola Oshodi (scientist) * Ianto Jones (junior researcher) =Torchwood Two, Glasgow= All that is known about the Glasgow division of the Torchwood Institute is that it is run by a \\"very strange man\\". In the novel The Twilight Streets (set in February 2008), Jack contacts the \\"very strange man\\" whose name is revealed as Archie, and Torchwood Two's headquarters are near the River Clyde. As with all spin-off media, the canonicity of this remains unclear. An e-mail shown in part one of Children of Earth (set in September 2009) suggests that Torchwood Two disbanded some time before the events of the first encounter with the 456, and that Torchwood Three is the only branch remaining. =Torchwood Three, Cardiff= Roald Dahl Plass, the exterior of Torchwood Three. Torchwood Three, whose base is also known as the 'Torchwood Hub', primarily serves as a monitoring station for a rift in time and space that runs through Cardiff. The job of Torchwood Three is to monitor the rift and control and seize what comes through it. Whereas the London branch is originally staffed by hundreds of individuals, the Cardiff branch is considerably smaller and employs only a small team of experts, hired by Captain Jack and is described as a \\"renegade outpost\\". It is located beneath Roald Dahl Plass, and may be entered via an \\"invisible lift\\" in the Plass, which can't be seen because of the perception filter that resides on that spot, or through a run-down Tourist Information Centre nearby. Torchwood Three is the setting of the eponymous Torchwood series. It is said by Jack Harkness that the Cardiff Branch has nothing to do with London and that all links were severed. In Torchwood: Children of Earth (2009), the Hub was destroyed, Ianto died, and Jack abandoned Earth, leaving pregnant Gwen the only remaining Torchwood agent. Doctor Who two-parter \\"The End of Time\\" refers to the Institute as no longer existing. Torchwood: Miracle Day (2011) shows that Gwen similarly left Torchwood Three behind after the events of Children of Earth. The Central Intelligence Agency believes all individuals previously affiliated with Torchwood to be dead. Some notable employees include: * Captain Jack Harkness (leader, alive) * Gwen Cooper (police liaison, alive) * Dr Owen Harper (medical officer, deceased)A set of episodes, starting with \\"Reset\\", and continuing with \\"Dead Man Walking\\" and \\"A Day in the Death\\", focused specifically on an undead Owen trying to accommodate as such. * Toshiko Sato (computer specialist, deceased) * Ianto Jones (administrator/general support, deceased) * Suzie Costello (weapons specialist, deceased) * Dr Martha Jones (UNIT liaison/medical officer, alive) Whilst the Institute officially disbanded after the events of Children of Earth Jack and Gwen work with several individuals from the United States to solve the Miracle Day phenomenon. CIA operative Rex Matheson and analyst Esther Drummond join the operation in \\"Rendition\\". Surgeon Vera Juarez allies herself to the cause in \\"The Categories of Life\\" but is killed off on her first undercover mission. =Torchwood Four, location unknown= Torchwood Four is described as \\"missing\\". It is not specified how this happened or where it may previously have been located before its disappearance. Captain Jack stated they would find it some day. In the novel The Twilight Streets, Jack says that in 1941, Torchwood Four was still missing. In the novel Risk Assessment, Torchwood's immortal assessor Agnes Haversham refers to Torchwood Four's disappearance as having been something of a messy business. =Torchwood India, Delhi= An Indian branch of Torchwood introduced in the radio play \\"Golden Age\\". Torchwood India was founded by Queen Victoria to find alien technology in the British Raj. It was led by Eleanor, Duchess of Melrose, who maintained the branch's cover as a gentlemen's club named the Royal Connaught Club. It was closed down by Captain Jack in 1924, when Torchwood realised the Raj was coming to an end, and all their alien equipment was taken to Britain. In 2009 Jack and Torchwood Three trace an alien energy field to the site of Torchwood India, and discover Eleanor and the other Torchwood India agents are using a time store to prevent time passing in the Royal Connaught Club. The store is powered by taking people's potential futures, killing them. Torchwood Three prevent the Duchess's plan to turn the whole planet back to 1924, resulting in the time store overloading. The club members refuse to leave before the building is frozen in time.\\"Golden Age\\", writer James Goss, director Kate McAll, producers Kate McAll and Brian Minchen. Torchwood (Cardiff: BBC) Cultural influence Due to the popularity of Doctor Who and Torchwood, Torchwood has had an influence on popular culture. On the heels of being featured in Torchwood, Cardiff has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the UK, in particular, the Wales Millennium Centre, with a resident commenting that tourists often jump on the paving slab that was used as the \\"magic lift\\" in the series. In January 2008, such was the popularity of Torchwood that being near the \\"Torchwood Tower\\" was used in advertising for local property. A January 2009 article comments on the attraction the Torchwood 'Hub' has brought to the Wales Millennium Centre, as Minister for Heritage Alun Ffred Jones announced that resultingly, \\"the Wales Millennium Centre building itself is now established as a symbol of modern Welsh culture\\".

The travellers who include Adelaide, Sydney, Bruce, Frazer, and Darwin (respectively a wallaby, an ostrich, a spider, a fruit bat, and a wombat), are members of the Gullagaloona backpackers club and are on a mission to travel the world. Discovering the caravan near London when lost, the travellers soon find the Winjin' Pom to be one of their biggest allies. A mafia-like team headed by evil Hammond organ playing vulture J.G. Chicago discover the caravan's ability to speak and decide to hijack it in a sinister plot to make themselves rich. Part of this mafia gang includes two villainous crows, who are brothers. Ronnie and Reggie (\\"The Crows\\") relentlessly chase the caravan and follow the backpackers on their travels in an attempt to steal it, always, of course, failing miserably. The Winjin' Pom (the name is a pun on the \\"whinging pom\\", an Aussie expression used to refer to a person of British origin who constantly complains about things he has to face) caravan is famous not only for talking but also for flying, something which occurs several episodes in after a hijack by The Crows. This talking-flying caravan was not seen by many people and the series did not air for long. Written by Richard Carpenter the television series appears to be aimed at teenagers, while it actually contains some impressive dialogue that convey a certain grittiness now and then, making it similar in spirit to The Simpsons TV show. The series particularly revolves around the friendly, joking banter on stereotypes: the grumpy Brit and adventurous Australian. The Winjin' Pom was broadcast in 1991 on commercial television and is owned by Spitting Image Productions and HIT Entertainment PLC. It was directed by Steve Bendelack and is not currently shown on any television network, nor is it available to own on video or DVD. Allegedly, the rights are available for purchase. At the time of the show's transmission, there was a novelisation written by Doctor Who writer Terrance Dicks and a tie-in magazine published by TriStar Publications. Main characters The Winjin' Pom: a talking, flying (and moaning) British van who acts as a way of transport for the protagonists. Depressive, pessimistic, and prone to self-pitying, Pom tends to see everything in a negative light, but he is nonetheless loyal to his friends, and it is often up to him to save the day when they're in a pinch. He is voiced by Michael Robbins, best known for his role as Arthur Rudge in sitcom On the Buses. Adelaide: a boyish female wallaby and the unofficial leader of the bunch; cranky and quick to retort, she's a real tomboy and could be seen as a feminist, compared to the more feminine Sydney. Adelaide is also skilled in mechanics and can be seen repairing Pom now and then. Named after Adelaide, a city in Australia. She is voiced by Kate Robbins. Sydney: a snobbish female ostrich with a taste for bragging and luxury... She complains a lot, and equally seems to annoy the others in return. She's usually the first one to duck and cover in case of danger, usually stuffing her head into a fireman's bucket. She also insists on being referred to as a cassowary, and not an ostrich... Named after Sydney, Australia's largest city. She is voiced by Ad√®le Anderson. Darwin: a middle- aged male wombat, Darwin is probably the most sensitive of the group, being an amateur poet and romantic. Clumsy, naive to a fault, and easily bewildered, he seems to get on Adelaide and Sydney's nerves a lot, and gets repeatedly called a wimp by his mates. Probably named after another city in Australia, which in turn was named after Charles Darwin. Frazer: a male fruit bat with a laid-back attitude. A good-hearted, tolerant young guy, Frazer is a cricket fanatic and has a taste for bananas. He's also good friend with Bruce. Named after Charles Fraser, a 19th-century botanist and explorer of Australia. Also, in Australia, an island known as Frazer is home to living fruit bats. Nigel Pegram does the voice. Bruce: an enthusiastic, wisecracking redback spider, Bruce's humour is just as deadly as his venom... Though loyal to his friends, he is a troublemaker and tends to annoy them somewhat, save for Frazer who seems to appreciate him. Upon meeting someone for the first time, Bruce's first question is usually \\"Can I bite him?\\" Despite being a male character, Alison Jiear provides the voice. J.G. Chicago: the heroes' main nemesis, a cold- hearted, calculating vulture who seems to be a sort of powerful underworld boss. A lover of opera, he is sustained by a complex medical apparatus and enjoys playing Hammond organ. J.G. is bent on stealing the Winjin' Pom and using his special abilities for his own benefits. Although he talks like Marlon Brando, the voice is actually supplied by. Ronnie and Reggie, the Crow Twins: a pair of nasty but single-minded crows, Ronnie and Reggie are twin brothers, and J.G.'s snivelling, incompetent associates. They occasionally manage to hijack the Winjin' Pom, but systematically end up failing. Named after the Kray Twins, the famous London gangland mobsters. The Crows, who also have a mother (I wonder if her name is Violet?), are voiced by comedy pair Mark Arden and Stephen Frost of Carling Black Label fame. Howard: a male spotted hyena and J.G.'s right hand. Somewhat clumsy and less evil that he'd want to let believe, he has a knack for putting himself into impossible situations. Poor Howard is also clearly terrified by J.G. and appears a little pathetic when he has to face his boss' outbursts of anger. It is also vaguely hinted that Howard is gay. William Todd-Jones provides the voice. Episodes 1\\\\. The Gullagaloona Backpackers arrive in London to collect their inheritance from their founder. They fortuitously stumble across the Winjin' Pom and get him working. However, two gangsters, Ronnie and Reggie Crow are themselves after the van, having left something in it. They finally reach Windsor, albeit too late to collect the inheritance. Nevermind ! They still have the Pom to tour the world ! 2\\\\. The loot left by the Crows inside the Pom turns out to be an old, scratched record of a famous Australian opera singer, which the vulture crime lord J.G. Chicago is coveting. After being wrongly put in jail and escaping thanks to Bruce, the Gullagaloona backpackers return the stolen item to its rightful owner, the old Lady Studemare, who rewards them... by allowing them to listen to the record, much to their chagrin !... 3\\\\. The travellers decide to sell the Pom after he puts them in trouble with a duo of vicious bull bikers, thus replacing him with a similar-looking campervan. Fortunately, it comes in handy to fool Ronnie, Reggie and Howard. 4\\\\. The backpackers arrive at a bed and breakfast that turns out to be haunted... However, Ronnie and Reggie have followed them, trying to get their hands once more on the campervan. Unexpected help comes from Raymond and Mavis, two ghost bats who are distant relatives of Frazer. 5\\\\. While being chased by the Crows, the Pom hides in a scrapyard. However, the vehicle is accidentally placed in an incinerator. To escape, Pom shrinks himself and the others inside (although Bruce escapes). Within 12 hours they will be back to normal size. However, Ronnie and Reggie see this as the perfect opportunity to please their boss, J.G. Chicago. 6\\\\. The Crows kidnap Adelaide as part of a plan by J.G. Chicago to lure the backpackers and Pom into a trap. Afterwards, the vulture cajoles the campervan into working for him. Will he realise where his true loyalties lie?

The USB HID class is defined in a number of documents provided by the USB Implementers Forum's Device Working Group. The primary document used to describe the USB HID class is the Device Class Definition for HID 1.11.  Devices  The USB HID class describes devices used with nearly every modern computer. Many predefined functions exist in the USB HID class. These functions allow hardware manufacturers to design a product to USB HID class specifications and expect it to work with any software that also meets these specifications. The same HID protocol is used unmodified in Bluetooth human interface devices. The Bluetooth profile specification only points readers to the USB HID documentation. In this sense those devices also belong to the USB HID class. = Keyboards = Keyboards are a common kind of USB HID class device. The USB HID class keyboard is normally designed with an IN endpoint that communicates keystrokes to the computer and an OUT endpoint that communicates the status of the keyboard's LEDs from the computer to the keyboard. The PC 97 standard requires that a computer's BIOS must detect and work with USB HID class keyboards that are designed to be used during the boot process. Some keyboards implement the USB Boot Keyboard profile specified in the USB Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID) v1.11 and are explicitly configured to use the boot protocol. These are limited to 6-key rollover (6KRO) and will interrupt the CPU every time the keyboard is polled (even if there is no state change) unless the USB controller overrides this behavior. This profile is intended to allow the BIOS to handle a USB keyboard in the absence of a USB-aware operating system. The recommended profile for keyboards that are not in boot mode in this specification limits keyboards to 6KRO and causes them to respond to an interrupt with a status report at least every half second (again, even if there is no state change) in order to implement typematic (repeating the scancode when the key is pressed long enough) unless the USB controller is programmed to tell the keyboard not to do this. However, keyboards in non-boot mode are free to implement an alternative HID profile. The above-mentioned behavior is in contrast to the PS/2 interface, which supports n-key rollover (NKRO) for keyboards capable of supporting it. The PS/2 interface does not interrupt the CPU at all when there are no state changes, except when a key is held long enough to activate typematic. Not having to respond to repeated polling saves power, so the PS/2 interface is often used in laptops' internal keyboards. = Mouse = Computer mice are another common USB HID class device. USB HID mice can range from single-button simple devices to multi-button compound devices. Most modern operating systems ship with drivers for standard HID mouse designs (the most common modern mouse design has two dedicated buttons and a mouse wheel that doubles as the third button); mice with extended functionality require custom drivers from the manufacturer. USB mice have lower latencies than PS/2 mice because standard USB mice are often polled at a default rate of 125 Hz while standard PS/2 mice send interrupts at a default rate of 100 Hz when they have data to send to the computer. Also, USB mice do not cause the USB controller to interrupt the system when they have no status change to report according to the USB HID specification's default profile for mouse devices. Both PS/2 and USB allow the sample rate to be overridden, with PS/2 supporting a sampling rate of up to 200 Hz and USB supporting a polling rate up to 1 kHz as long as the USB mouse runs at full-speed or higher USB speeds. As a result of the PS/2 mouse interface's interrupt-driven nature that does not require periodic polling, PS/2 interface saves power, which makes it a popular choice for pointing devices integrated into laptops. = Game controllers = Modern game controllers and joysticks are often USB HID class devices. Unlike legacy game port devices, USB HID class game devices do not normally require proprietary drivers to function. Nearly all game devices will function using onboard drivers as long as the device is designed around the drivers and the USB HID class specifications. = Other devices = The USB HID class specifications allow for myriad other devices under the USB HID class. Some examples are automobile simulation controllers, exercise machines, telephony devices, thermometers, audio controls and medical instrumentation. Even uninterruptible power supplies and software protection dongles declare themselves under this class, despite the fact they often have no human interface at all. Any device can be a USB HID class device as long as a designer meets the USB HID class logical specifications. This is not to say that there is no need to ship drivers for these devices, nor that an operating system will immediately recognize the device. This only means that the device can declare itself under the human interface device class. = Security vulnerabilities = The USB interface is vulnerable to security exploits such as BadUSB that abuse the combination of USB's ability to connect many different kinds of devices, its inability to verify that devices are actually what they claim to be, the possibility for USB devices to change their type or announce additional subdevices while plugged in, and its default behavior of accepting any device that connects to it. As a partial countermeasure, PS/2 peripherals may be used instead together with disabling all USB ports.  Drivers  One of the benefits of a well-defined specification like the USB HID class is the abundance of device drivers available in most modern operating systems. The USB HID class devices and their basic functions are defined in USB-IF documentation without any specific software in mind. Because of these generic descriptions, it is easy for operating system designers to include functioning drivers for devices such as keyboards, mice, and other generic human interface devices. The inclusion of these generic drivers allows for faster deployment of devices and easier installation by end-users.  Logical specifications  = Functional characteristics = The USB human interface device class can be used to describe both device and interface classes. The interface class is used when a USB device can contain more than one function. It is possible, therefore, to have USB devices with two different interfaces at the same time (for example, a USB telephone may use a keypad covered by the HID class and a speaker covered by the USB communications device class). The interface devices are also defined with subclass descriptors. The subclass descriptor is used to declare a device bootable. A boot device meets a minimum adherence to a basic protocol and will be recognized by a computer's BIOS. Each USB HID interface communicates with the host using either a control pipe or an interrupt pipe. Isochronous and bulk pipes are not used in HID class devices. Both IN and OUT control transfers are required for enumeration; only an IN interrupt transfer is required for HID reports. OUT interrupt transfers are optional in HID-class devices. = Reports = The USB HID class requires that every device describes how it will communicate with the host device in order to accurately predict and define all current and future human interface devices. During enumeration the device describes how its reports are to be structured so that the host device can properly prepare to receive this information. The host periodically polls the device's interrupt IN endpoint during operation. When the device has data to send it forms a report and sends it as a reply to the poll token. Common devices such as keyboards and mice send reports that are compliant with standards set by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). When a vendor makes a custom USB HID class device, the reports formed by the device need to match the report description given during enumeration and the driver installed on the host system. In this way it is possible for the USB HID class to be extremely flexible.  USB HID API  There are two levels of APIs related to USB HID: the USB level and the operating system level. At the USB level, there is a protocol for devices to announce their capabilities and the operating system to parse the data it gets. The operating system then offers a higher-level view to applications, which do not need to include support for individual devices but for classes of devices. This abstraction layer allows a game to work with any USB controller, for example, even ones created after the game.

He was also a major Ukrainian landowner, the proprietor of several sugar factories, and a financier. Biography Born to a rich Tereshchenko family of a sugar factory owners, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and art patrons of Ivan Nikolaevich (1854‚Äì1903) and Elizabeth Mikhailovna. Mikhail had a younger brother Mykola (1894‚Äì?). His uncle Aleksandr Tereshchenko (1856‚Äì1911) worked in Saint- Petersburg. Mikhail Tereshchenko graduated from Kiev University and Leipzig University. In 1910, he joined the Freemasonry and became one of the five prominent Masons in Russia (the other four being Aleksandr Konovalov, Alexander Kerensky, Nikolai Nekrasov, and Ivan Yefremov). Mikhail Tereshchenko was a member of the Fourth State Duma (he shared the views of the Russian Progressive Party). In 1912-1914, Tereshchenko was the owner of a private publishing house Sirin in St Petersburg, which published Andrey Bely's pioneering novel Petersburg in three installments in 1913‚Äì1914. During World War I, he took part in organizing the Red Cross hospitals. In 1915-1917, Mikhail Tereshchenko was the chairman of the Military Industry Committee of the Kiev district and deputy chairman of the All-Russian Military Industry Committee. After the February Revolution of 1917, Mikhail Tereshchenko was appointed Minister of Finance of the Provisional Kerensky Government. In April 1917, Tereshchenko (together with Kerensky and Nekrasov) was actively seeking to create a governmental interparty coalition with the Socialists. On 5 May 1917, he was appointed minister of foreign affairs after the resignation of Pavel Milyukov. Tereshchenko continued his foreign policy course, which led to his conflict with Minister of War Alexander Verkhovsky, who had considered Russia to be unable to continue the war. He was a member of the Directorate in September 1917. Tereshchenko was known to support the Ukrainian government that led to the establishment and recognition of the General Secretariat in Ukraine 1917. On the night of 26 October, Mikhail Tereshchenko was arrested in the Winter Palace with other ministers of the Provisional Government and placed into the Peter and Paul Fortress while his office was temporarily held by Anatoly Neratov. In the spring of 1918, Tereshchenko escaped from prison and fled to Norway with the Tereshchenko blue diamond, sold in 1984 for $4.6 million, by Christie's later on, to Robert Mouawad, a famous Lebanese jeweller. Tereshchenko was one of the supporters of allied intervention in Soviet Russia. In 1920s and 1930s, he was engaged in financial activities in France and Madagascar. Personal life Tereshenko was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia‚Äôs Peoples. Along with Kerensky, Alexander Galpern, Yefremov, Kolyubakin and Nekrasov, he was a member of the lodge \\"La Petite Ourse\\" (Ursa Minor), which was founded in 1910 in St. Petersburg. This lodge was considered the coordinating lodge of the entire Grand Orient of Russia's Peoples.

His family migrated to California along a path similar to many Bakersfield Okies, first moving to Chandler, Arizona, in 1938, and two years later to Bakersfield, California. Moseley's mother worked in a dry cleaner‚Äôs shop, his father with the Southern Pacific Railroad.Price, Robert, , The Bakersfield Californian. Has biographical notes on Semie Moseley. In Bakersfield, Moseley started playing guitar in an evangelical group at age 13.Thompson, Art, \\"Mosrite 40th Anniversary\\", Guitar Player magazine, January 2007. Moseley and his brother Andy experimented with guitars since teen-age years, refinishing instruments and building new necks. Joe Maphis's Mosrite double-necked guitar In 1954, Moseley built a triple-neck guitar in his garage (the longest neck was a standard guitar, the second-longest neck an octave higher, the shortest was an eight-string mandolin). He presented a double-neck to Joe Maphis, a Los Angeles-area TV performer. By 1956, with an investment from Reverend Ray Boatright, a local Los Angeles minister, the brothers started their company, Mosrite of California. Moseley, who built guitars for the Los Angeles-based Rickenbacker company, said to his co-workers that he was making his own product, and he was fired by Rickenbacker. When they began, their production was all custom, handmade guitars, built in garages, tin storage sheds, wherever the Moseleys could put equipment. In 1959, Andy Moseley moved to Nashville, Tennessee for a year to popularize the Mosrite name and sold a few to Grand Ole Opry entertainers, people, and to road musicians. Andy Moseley said: \\"And that‚Äôs how we kept the factory going at the time: custom guitars\\". The brothers also got into the recording business by establishing Mosrite Records. They signed Barbara Mandrell, a teenage daughter of Irby Mandrell, a music-store owner who sold Mosrite guitars. They also signed guitarist Ronny Sessions and others.\\"Ronnie Sessions\\", Rockabilly Hall of Fame. At the peak of production in 1968, Moseley and his brother, with their crew of 107 employees, were making 1,000 Mosrite guitars per month, which included acoustics, standard electrics, double-necks, triple-necks, basses, dobros, and mandolins. Mosrite of California went bankrupt in late 1968 after they contracted with a competitor to market their guitars. After this, they tried to deal directly with stores, and they sold 280 guitars in 1969 before they came to the shop one day and found their doors padlocked. Two years after his bankruptcy, Moseley was able to get back the Mosrite name, and in 1970, he started making guitars again in Pumpkin Center near Bakersfield. He moved his factory three times in the next 20 years, to Oklahoma City in the mid-70s, to the township of Jonas Ridge in Burke County, North Carolina in 1981, and to Booneville, Arkansas in 1991. Six months after moving to Arkansas, Moseley became ill with bone cancer and died six weeks later, in August 1992. Moseley's daughter Dana is also a luthier and continues to build Mosrite guitars.Dana Moseley page - Ed Roman Guitars She also helps kick off the monthly Mosrite Jam in Bakersfield.Munoz, Matt, \\"Mos-rite-teous!

It aired weekdays at 3PM in the Puget Sound area of Washington. It was produced locally by Seattle TV station KOMO-TV Channel 4, and debuted in September 1984. The series ended its run on September 5, 2008 after a run of nearly 24 years. Format The show's format, unchanged since its debut, began with a 15-minute daily recap of soap opera serials aired that day, with the last 45 minutes being a talk/variety-type show. In the latter portion of the show, subjects could vary from show to show. In one show, a famous TV, movie, or newsmaking celebrity may make an appearance as a special guest (usually discussing their latest work, etc.), while the very next day could focus on a guest who has survived against all odds. The show originated from Studio C of KOMO-TV's old building until it was demolished to make way for Fisher Plaza in 2000. On June 10, 2008 KOMO-TV announced that Northwest Afternoon was cancelled because of increased competition against first-run syndicated fare from Dr. Phil on KING-TV, Rachael Ray on KIRO-TV, and Maury on KCPQ. These shows had made inroads into Northwest Afternoon's once-comfortable ratings, making it difficult for station management to continue producing the show. The stunning announcement came after the series won a local Emmy. A 24-year retrospective send-off was aired on September 4, 2008, with the last show airing on September 5.From Seattle PI.com (June 10, 2008) The show was replaced by The Doctors, a syndicated show that premiered on September 8, 2008. Hosts The original hosts of the show were Dick Foley and Dana Middleton, with the soap-opera recap portion of the show hosted by Cindi Rinehart. Dana Middleton left in 1992 to pursue other interests. Middleton's replacement was Elisa Jaffe, a reporter and morning news anchor for KOMO News who had also launched \\"Morning Express\\", the station's first hour-long morning newscast in 1987. Dick Foley departed in 1996, and was replaced by KPLZ radio host Kent Phillips (who had been filling in on occasion for Rinehart for a few years prior). The main portion of the program was most recently hosted by Kent Phillips, with rebroadcasts of segments co-hosted by Natasha Curry (who joined Northwest Afternoon in 2007), and KOMO News reporter Rachelle Murcia. Scoop on the Soaps Scoop on the Soaps was the opening segment, usually 15‚Äì20 minutes in length, in which Cindi Rinehart gave viewers a daily recap of the happenings in the soap opera world. Her awkward style became legendary, though her segment was frequented - either in person or with live telephone calls - by major soap stars and producers, and Reinhart herself has even starred in soaps such as General Hospital. Reinhart also attracted many fans beyond the Northwest. Since the show was also seen across Canada on satellite, it was not uncommon for viewers to call as far away as Nova Scotia and Quebec just to ask Reinhart questions about what would happen on the soaps.

Its population was estimated at 62,028 in 2001, of which 90% are Pashtun people with others from the Hazara people. Sangar, in the center of the district, is the capital. Most of the population live in the Jikhai River valley and depend upon agriculture, the main source of its economy. The last decade of severe winters and droughts have affected the economy and quality of life..  Politics and Governance   Healthcare   Education   Infrastructure  Geography Aerial view of Ajristan District Ajristan (or Hujiristan) was previously including most part of the Hazara homeland. Ajristan has currently an area of and consists of a series of valleys. The hills Shah Tus Aka Ghar and Koishafil surround Ajristan and act as natural barriers. There are no natural boundaries between Ajristan and adjoining districts of Malistan to the northeast, Gizab and Sangi Masha to the east, and Daya Chopan. The closest major city is Ghazni to the west. Ajristan lies in the lap of several mountain ranges, which are the extensions of Shah Tus Baba, so a larger part consists of high mountains and hills. The ranges are irregularly placed: some extend to the west; others to the east, but the general direction is north‚Äìsouth. The mountain ranges enclose many small valleys. In the middle of the valley passes the Jikhai River, a major source of water, especially for agriculture. Demographics Ajristan was historically part of Uruzgan Province, when it was called Daya wa Polad. Hazara people were the original inhabitants of the district until the 1880s. After their disastrous defeat in the early 1890s, they were mostly killed or driven out. The district is now dominated mostly by the Pashtun. However, some Hazara remnants are still living there as the minority. Pashto is the language spoken by majority of Ajristani residents. Other languages include Persian. Pashton peoples in this area originate mostly from the Mulla Khail Tribe. Climate Ajristan has a semi-arid climate with a significant temperature variation between summer and winter. Summer starts in late May and continues until early September with average temperatures ranging from 24 to 26 ¬∞C (75‚Äì78 ¬∞F). The highest recorded temperature is on 10 July 1998. Autumn begins in late September and continues until mid-November with average temperatures in the 12‚Äì18 ¬∞C (55‚Äì65 ¬∞F) range. Winter starts in late November and ends in late March, with average temperatures near 4‚Äì5 ¬∞C (39‚Äì41 ¬∞F). The lowest recorded temperature was on 8 January 1970. Spring starts in early April and ends in late May with average temperatures near 15 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F). Unlike areas to the east, Ajristan does not have a monsoon season of heavy rainfall. Highest recorded rainfall within 24 hours is on 17 December 2000. Highest recorded monthly rainfall is in March 1982, and the highest recorded annual rainfall was in 1982. Snowfall occurs primarily in December, January, and February and is the principal precipitation in the winter. During a severe drought from 1999 to 2001, Ajristan did not receive any snowfall, and rainfall was below normal levels. In 2003, the district received significant snowfall after a long drought. In 2004 and 2005, it received normal rains for the first time in three years with some snowfall, while in 2006, 2007, and 2009, the district received no snow. In 2008, Ajristan received four inches of snow in four hours on 29 January 2008. On 2 February 2008, Ajristan received ten inches of snow in 10 hours, the heaviest snowfall for the district in the last ten years. During the winter of 2010, it received no snow and suffered below normal levels of rainfall due to El-Nino. Economy The severe droughts and winters have taken a toll on the economy, which is based mostly on agriculture and other locally grown products. A 2009 paper describes Ajristan residents \\"eating alfalfa, which is...detrimental to the human digestive system,\\" a problem compounded by the lack of adequate medical care in the area. Most karezes have dried, so the district relies on a few wells and the Jikhai River for water.

Little is known about his life: originally from the village of Uttenweiler near Biberach an der Ri√ü in Upper Swabia, he was the organist of the convent of canonesses in Lindau/Lake Constance. His only surviving work is the musical-dramatic festival play Armamentarium comicum amoris et honoris (The Comic Armory of Love and Honor), written on the occasion of the wedding of Count Maximilian Willibald of Waldburg-Wolfegg and Clara Isabella Princess of Aarschot and Arenberg, that took place in Lindau on December 6, 1648. Armamentarium combined the Jesuit theatre tradition with the Italian monody of the early Baroque period and was performed by pupils of the Lindau Jesuit college on December 8, 1648. It is one of the earliest surviving examples of an operatic work performed in Germany. The libretto (by an unknown author) is highly allegorical and focussed on the heraldic symbols that the combined coat of arms of the bridal couple would contain. These allegories are introduced by biblical figures from the Old Testament. Since that custom-made plot was not appropriate for performances beyond the original purpose, the work vanished into oblivion. It was recently rediscovered in the musical collections of the Dukes of Waldburg-Wolfegg and performed at Schloss Wolfegg on September 11, 2005, by the Hassler-Consort ensemble, conducted by Franz Raml.

A more concise way to state this is that the category of elements of F is the comma category \\\\ast\\\\downarrow F, where \\\\ast is a one-point set. The category of elements of F comes with a natural projection \\\\mathop{\\\\rm el}(F) \\\\to C that sends an object (A,a) to A, and an arrow (A,a) \\\\to (B,b) to its underlying arrow in C.  The category of elements of a presheaf  In some texts (e.g. Mac Lane, Moerdijk) the category of elements is used for presheaves. We state it explicitly for completeness. If P \\\\in\\\\hat C := \\\\mathbf{Set}^{C^{op}} is a presheaf, the category of elements of P (again denoted by \\\\mathop{\\\\rm el}(P), or, to make the distinction to the above definition clear, ‚à´C P=‚à´Cop P) is the category defined as follows: * Objects are pairs (A,a) where A \\\\in \\\\mathop{\\\\rm Ob}(C) and a\\\\in P(A). * An arrow (A,a)\\\\to (B,b) is an arrow f:A\\\\to B in C such that (Pf)b = a.

Consequentially, in the spirit of adding a \\"co\\" in front of the name for a construction to denote its opposite, one should rather call this category the category of coelements of P. For C small, this construction can be extended into a functor ‚à´C from \\\\hat C to \\\\mathbf{Cat}, the category of small categories. In fact, using the Yoneda lemma one can show that ‚à´CP \\\\cong \\\\mathop{\\\\textbf{y}}\\\\downarrow P, where \\\\mathop{\\\\textbf{y}}: C \\\\to \\\\hat{C} is the Yoneda embedding.

In 1949 the area was separated from Jaghori District. During the Soviet Occupation Maoist resistance groups were particularly active. After Harakat lost in Qarabagh of Ghazni in 1985 to Nasr, the political organizations united to force out Hizb-e Islami from the districts of Jaghori and Malistan. However, there were only sporadic clashes here and the central government lacked interest in Malistan. Around 1997, as the Taliban began to take control of Hazarajat the area was put under food blockade, leaving approximately 1 million Hazaras on the bring of starvation, including those in Malistan. In 2002, plans were drawn up to split Malistan into four separate districts, in order to ease access to the judation, government office, huge population and distance area from Miradina, these plans are not believed to have been carried through.

Most importantly, even though the Taliban are said, as of 2008, to have only limited activity in the district, the security situation in other parts of the province has greatly affected the livelihood of the inhabitants, posing serious threats to their life, security and freedom. The districts are inaccessible except through Taliban territory, where the road has reportedly been mined and in some areas vehicles have been banned.Reuter Christoph, Borhan Younus. ‚ÄúThe Return of the Taliban in Andar District: Ghazni.‚Äù Decoding the New Taliban: Insights from the Afghan Field.

According to some reports the road from Qarabagh District to Jaghouri, passing through Malistan is under particular threat, with kidnappings and up to 150 cars having been stolen. There are also concerns that the Taliban will use the Kuchi nomads to exert their influence in the region. Agriculture and development According to information from the United Nations Food Program for Afghanistan in 2003 and the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development in 2007, the main crops in the area are wheat, corn, maize, peas, grapes, almonds, potatoes, onions and herbs. 182 Community Development Committees were reportedly active in Malistan in 2008.

It was composed of Irish line infantry regiments and served with distinction in the Tunisian and Italian Campaigns. A similar formation, the 38th Brigade had served in World War I, but contained no Irish connection. History The 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade came into existence on 13 January 1942 by the re-designation of the 210th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a Home Defence formation organised in October 1940. The 210th Brigade had been serving in Dorset County Division. When that division was disbanded on 24 November 1941, 210 Brigade transferred to the 1st Infantry Division. By then, all of 210 Brigade's English home defence battalions had been posted away and were replaced by the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers, the 6th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles. Of the three battalions, only the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers had seen active service, fighting in the Battle of France where they were forced to retreat to Dunkirk and were subsequently evacuated to England. In June 1942, the brigade was transferred from the 1st Infantry Division to the 6th Armoured Division and it landed in North Africa with the division on 22 November 1942, as part of the British First Army. In March 1943, it exchanged with the 1st Guards Brigade and joined the 78th Battleaxe Infantry Division and fought with distinction throughout the rest of the Tunisian Campaign. In late April, the 38th (Irish) Brigade played a lead role in the capture of the German defensive positions in the mountains north of Medjez-el-Bab and the campaign ended in mid-May, with almost 250,000 Axis soldiers surrendering. The brigade were the first marching troops to enter Tunis on 8 May 1943. Universal Carriers and troops of the 6th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, move up to Catenanuova, Sicily, August 1943. After a short rest, the brigade again saw action in the Allied invasion of Sicily (in particular the capture of Centuripe), and in the Italian Campaign, spearheading the British Eighth Army's advance to the Volturno Line, and later at the Battle of Monte Cassino and at Lake Trasimene. Shortly afterwards, the brigade was sent to rest in Egypt. While there, the 6th Inniskillings was disbanded and the men transferred to the 2nd Battalion, another Regular Army unit, which had arrived from 13th Brigade of the 5th Division, and the surplus men were transferred to fill gaps in the other battalions of the brigade.Ford pp. 242-243 Universal Carriers of the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers pass a wrecked German Nebelwerfer rocket launcher near Ceprano, Italy, 28 May 1944. The rest was short-lived, however, and the brigade soon returned to Italy where it was involved in fighting north of Florence, followed later by Operation Grapeshot. During May 1945, it was (briefly) detached to both 46th Infantry and 6th Armoured Divisions and the brigade then was allotted occupation duties in Carinthia in southern Austria, before being formally disbanded in April 1947.The Irish BrigadeJoslen, p. 373. =Order of battle= The 38th Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers * 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles * 6th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (disbanded 5 August 1944) * 2nd Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (from 26 July 1944) =Commanders= The following officers commanded the 38th Brigade during the war: * Brigadier Morgan O'Donovan (12 January 1942 ‚Äì 1 July 1942) * Brigadier Nelson Russell (1 July 1942 ‚Äì 20 February 1944) * Brigadier Thomas (Pat) Scott (from 20 February 1944) =Formations served under= Formations that the brigade served under included: * 1st Infantry Division 25 November 1941 ‚Äì 7 June 1942 * 6th Armoured Division 9 June 1942 ‚Äì 16 February 1943 * 'Y\\" Division 16 Feb 43 ‚Äì 15 March 1943 * 78th Infantry Division 15 March 1943 ‚Äì 28 March 1943 * 46th Infantry Division 29 March 1943 ‚Äì 6 April 1943 * 78th Infantry Division 7 April 1943 ‚Äì 10 May 1945 * 6th Armoured Division 10 May 1945 ‚Äì 13 May 1945 * 46th Infantry Division 13 May 1945 ‚Äì 18 May 1945 * 78th Infantry Division 18 May 1945 ‚Äì 31 August 1945 21st century 38 (Irish) Brigade reformed on 1 August 2007, as part of a new combined divisional / brigade structure called HQ Northern Ireland and 38 (Irish) Brigade after the disbandment of HQ Northern Ireland and has its headquarters at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn.Hansard, proceedings of the British Parliament The 38 Brigade subsequently came under command of the 2nd Division, the regional division for Scotland, the North of England and Northern Ireland, on 1 January 2009.

This was the culmination of a drawdown of military headquarters in Northern Ireland, which had seen the disbandment of 3 Infantry Brigade, 8 Infantry Brigade, 39 Infantry Brigade and 107 (Ulster) Brigade. Today the Army Reserve soldiers from the brigade have served on operations supporting the Regular Army in the Balkans, on Operation TOSCA in Cyprus, on Operation HERRICK in Afghanistan and Operation TELIC in Iraq.

Frei's work played a major role in the development of postliberal theology (also called narrative theology or the Yale school of theology). His best-known and most influential work is his 1974 book, The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative (Yale University Press), which examined the history of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century biblical hermeneutics in England and Germany. Frei spent much of his career teaching at Yale Divinity School. Early life =Europe= Hans Frei once described his early years as involving a series of \\"worlds left behind\\". He was born on April 29, 1922, in Breslau, Lower Silesia, Germany, to secularized Jewish parents (Magda Frankfurther Frei, a pediatrician; Wilhelm Siegmund Frei, a venereologist on the medical faculty of the University of Breslau). That Jewish culture did not play a huge part in his upbringing can be seen from the fact that he was baptized into the Lutheran church along with most other members of his class, and from his memory that he was forbidden from using Yiddish phrases at home. His family was reasonably well-to-do and considered themeselves to have a distinguished past. Young Hans got a solid German education and read widely in the classics. As antisemitic violence rose in Germany, he was sent away from that world ‚Äì away from Nazi Germany to the Quaker school in Saffron Walden, England, in January 1935. Although he found speaking English daunting and was sometimes lonely, he found England a welcoming and courteous place, and despite his own isolation and anxiety was struck by the absence in England of the pervasive fear which he thought had been a feature of life in 1930s Germany. Young Frei believed that war was on the way, and wanted to stay in England. It was at the Friend's school that Frei saw a picture of Jesus and suddenly \\"knew that it was true\\" ‚Äì this conversion experience led him to a form of Christianity which at this stage had nothing to do with attendance at church. Later in his life, even when Quaker theology ran against the grain of his own thinking, he still their meetings more satisfying than his adopted Anglican liturgies. =America= After three years, in August 1938, his parents left Germany, and Frei moved with them to the United States, where he was terrified by his encounter with New York City. It was a difficult time, and Frei had trouble feeling that he belonged. The family were very short of money, and were only able to find him a scholarship to study textile engineering at North Carolina State University (after seeing an advertisement for it in a paper). He gained a Bachelor of Science degree there in 1942. Nevertheless, he took to his adopted country and made it thoroughly his own ‚Äì so much so that when he went back to Germany for a visit in the 1950s he felt most definitely like a visiting American Professor rather than a German exile returned. In particular, he found a home within America in New Haven, Connecticut, at Yale University. Turning to theology While at North Carolina State, Frei heard a lecture by the prominent theologian H. Richard Niebuhr, began corresponding with him, and eventually enrolled for a Bachelor of Divinity degree at Yale Divinity School (YDS), Niebuhr's base. It was there that he found a kind of home. Despite some wanderings in the years between 1945 and 1947 and 1950 and 1956, Frei described YDS as the \\"world not left behind\\". There he was taught by Niebuhr and by R. L. Calhoun and Julian Hartt, and there some of his deepest theological attitudes were shaped, some of his deepest friendships formed, all his most important work done, and his tremendously successful teaching and administrative duties carried out. He graduated in 1945, and became a Baptist minister at the First Baptist Church, North Stratford, New Hampshire. Despite the work involved in the parish, in being a local preacher, and in some teaching work, Frei found time to read a great deal in solitude. He found himself drawn towards Anglicanism, towards what he saw as its more obviously 'generous' orthodoxy ‚Äì to such an extent that in later life he was to say that Baptist ministry had always felt like a staging post on the way to somewhere else. At the same time, he developed a yearning for more academic work. Frei returned to the graduate school at Yale Divinity School in 1947, and began a lengthy doctoral dissertation under H. Richard Niebuhr, on Karl Barth's early doctrine of Revelation. This was to take until 1956 to complete ‚Äì but some of that time is explained by the other things Frei was doing. On October 9, 1948, he married Geraldine Frost Nye. He landed a job as Assistant Professor of Religion at Wabash College, Indiana, in 1950. A son, Thomas, was born in 1952. In 1953 Frei became Associate Professor of Theology at the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest (with some time as Visiting Lecturer in the Southern Methodist University in 1954), and was involved with St. John's Episcopal Church in Crawfordsville, Indiana, while teaching at Wabash College. In 1955 a second son, Jonathan, was born. He completed his thesis in 1956 and was promoted to Professor of Theology. A year later, he returned to Yale Divinity School as Assistant Professor of Religious Studies, and, in the same year, his daughter Emily was born. Between 1958 and 1966 Frei worked away more or less in obscurity. As can be seen from an annotated bibliography, there are very few recorded writings from this period. After the publication of two essays for a festschrift for Niebuhr in 1957 (including extracts from his thesis), and a short article on 'Religion, Natural and Revealed' in a handbook of Christian theology published the following year, there is a great gap. Frei delivered a talk on Ludwig Feuerbach at the 1965 meeting of the American Academy of Religion, admittedly, but this does not seem to have been particularly central to his work. All the indications are that he had thrown himself into teaching, and into the slow, painstaking research that would eventually emerge as The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative. In many ways he felt that the stands he had taken in his thesis against prevailing modes of apologetical and anthropocentric theology isolated him (again), made his work a struggle against the tide. He did not have the temperament for the kind of sweeping statements and rabble-rousing clarion calls which might have pulled supporters to his side, and he produced his careful and complex writings only after taking great pains. It was during this period of obscurity that Frei received a Morse Fellowship and a Fulbright Award for research at the University of G√∂ttingen (1959‚Äì60) . A little later, with the help of an American Association of Theological Schools Fellowship and a Yale Senior Faculty Fellowship, Frei spent some time in Cambridge, England (1966-7). His trip back to Germany was clouded by the sense that the recent past had been brushed under an inadequate rug, that it didn't matter, that Germany had re- invented itself rather than dealing with what had taken place. A meeting with Emanuel Hirsch, which was only granted when Frei agreed not to raise the question of Nazism, confirmed Frei's impressions. Frei also spent time in England, which he appears to have enjoyed, and even though he found that nothing much was going on theologically in Cambridge that interested him, he frequently referred back in later life to how much he had enjoyed his time there. Earlier theological work Frei was appointed Associate Professor in 1963. Then, between 1966 and 1968, almost as an interruption to the work which was proceeding towards Eclipse, Frei produced a 'theological proposal' ‚Äì a lengthy article, expanded a little later into an adult education course, commented on in a lecture, and accompanied by a contribution to a seminar on the work of Karl Barth, after the latter's death. This 'proposal' emerged to wider scrutiny only some years later, when (in 1975) the adult education course was republished as The Identity of Jesus Christ. This strange project, an exercise in the rethinking of the structure and bases of Christology and, even though Frei soon developed doubts about various important aspects of it, it sets the tone and the themes for most of the rest of what he went on to say in theology. After that brief flurry of activity, Frei returned to honing his work on Eclipse, which was eventually published (to much wider recognition) in 1974. By that time, Frei had been Acting Master of Silliman College, Yale (1970‚Äì1971), and Master of Ezra Stiles College (from 1972), the latter a post he was to hold until 1980. The publication of Eclipse coincided with Frei's appointment to a full Professorship. Frei then entered another period of comparative silence, although this time it was not in complete obscurity: his name was out, rattling around in theological and historical circles attached to the massive and ground-breaking Eclipse, with Identity as a strange accompaniment. His silence was not so much due to the pressures of teaching or to isolated and exhaustive research, but to his commitment to his job as Master of Ezra Stiles. Frei also served as chair of the council of masters in 1975. The 1970s were a difficult decade for Frei. He found himself troubled about his links to the church. Firmly convinced theologically that he should have some kind of ecclesiastical grounding and location for his work as well as his academic setting, he nevertheless felt distanced from his adopted Anglican home, and yet committed to stay there. He found himself theologically uneasy about the places where he did feel less isolated ‚Äì in particular, Quaker meetings. At the same time he found himself unable easily to call himself a theologian, particularly not a systematic theologian, and he concentrated his energies instead on the 'religious studies' (for which read 'historical') side of his work. Nevertheless, the questions he asked, the issues which interested him, the way he pursued that historical work ‚Äì all were theological, and he knew it. The ambivalence seems not exactly to have haunted him, but at least to have been never far from his working mind. The major work which Frei completed in this decade (after Eclipse) was all historical. He directed a National Endowment for the Humanities summer seminar in 1976 (his title was 'Modernity as Temptation'), and he delivered various lectures including the Rice Lectures in 1974 (on Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Johann Gottfried Herder and Immanuel Kant) and the George F. Thomas Memorial Lectures in 1978 (on Lessing). He also produced a piece of work which he thought of as perhaps his finest: the essay on David Strauss which was eventually published in 1985, although Frei finished it in the very early 1980s after having worked on it throughout the last years of the 1970s. Later theological work In the late seventies, Frei's outlook began to shift. He found himself increasingly drawn away from purely intellectual history and towards social history; in tandem he found his doubts about aspects of the Identity and Eclipse phase of his work crystallizing in a shift away from more theoretical hermeneutical solutions towards more social, \\"cultural-linguistic\\" ‚Äì and, we might say, more ecclesiological and pneumatological ‚Äì solutions. In the 1978 George F. Thomas Lecture, he issued what can in retrospect be seen as something of a personal manifesto, using the word \\"sensibility\\" to denote the object of a kind of historical study which would look for the shape and development of religious styles, attitudes and doctrines firmly embedded in the development and interaction of social institutions of various overlapping kinds. In 1981, he spent some time in England during which he looked, on advice from Owen Chadwick, at visitation returns and sermons from the eighteenth century life of a couple of English parishes, hoping to find a way to combine the more social and cultural historical insights which these things gave him into the Christianity of the time with the insights he had hitherto gained through a more traditional study of well-known high-culture theologians and philosophers. From 1982 until 1988, his time as Master over, Frei returned to publishing and writing with a vengeance. Although still not prolific by the standards of many of his contemporaries, by his own standards his output was vast. He returned to both strands of his earlier constructive theological work: hermeneutics (which had been the subject matter of Eclipse) and Christology (the subject matter of Identity). In 1982 he delivered a paper on the interpretation of narrative, at Haverford College; in 1983 the Shaffer Lectures at Yale (in which he began to develop what has subsequently become a famous five-place typology for understanding modern theology) and delivered a long paper on hermeneutics at the University of California. His work did not even flag when he became chair of the Department of Religious Studies from 1983 to 1986. He spoke in 1985 in response to an assessment of his work by the evangelical theologian Carl F. H. Henry; in 1986 he spoke at a conference in honour of J√ºrgen Moltmann, delivered a lecture at Princeton University, and spoke on Barth and Friedrich Schleiermacher at a conference at Stony Point, New York. In 1987 he delivered the Cadbury lectures in Birmingham, England, and the Humanities Council lectures at Princeton. He prepared a contribution to Bruce Marshall's festschrift for George Lindbeck, and another for a conference on H. Richard Niebuhr to be held in September 1988. Most of these papers and lectures were indirectly or directly directed towards one end: a history of the figure of Jesus in popular and high culture in England and Germany since 1750. Frei seems to have found a new theological confidence bubbling up with this historical project, however: now, more than ever, the two sides of his work (which had been the source of his ambivalence in the 1970s) become inextricably linked. One moment he can be talking about the rise of the professions in Germany and the impact that had on theology in the Universities. The next moment he can be talking about the sensus literalis of scripture and theology as Christian self-description. The next moment (although this is not immediately evident from his published work) he can be talking about providence and pilgrimage. It is hard now to gauge exactly what shape the final project would have taken in which all this rich material would have been combined, but it is clear that Frei wished to pursue theological reflection through the medium of detailed historical work, and wished to hone a full-blown Christology of his own ‚Äì a Christology which would have had a significant political dimension ‚Äì by paying detailed attention to the ways in which Jesus had been described and redescribed in Western Protestant culture since the Enlightenment. Death The potential project of a comprehensive Christology was, however, never completed. Before he could deliver a paper he had written for a conference on H. Richard Niebuhr, he fell ill, and the paper was given in his absence. Frei died of a stroke on September 12, 1988, at the peak of his theological and historical career.

AFL career =Richmond (2005-2010)= In the 2004 AFL Draft Tambling was a first round selection, the number four pick overall, and drafted to the Richmond Football Club. Richmond had the opportunity to recruit Lance Franklin, some say this was bad judgement made by the Richmond recruitment personnel.Le Grand, Chip (8 February 2008) Richard Tambling's hard story told with grace; The Australian In comparison to Franklin, Tambling's tenure at Richmond has been enigmatic. He had long been considered a dominant player up in the Northern Territory with his explosive speed and ability to read the play; he only confirmed that status throughout the 2004 pre-season. Terry Wallace was particularly impressed, saying he and Deledio were the \\"best young kids in the country\\". He played in 12 games in the 2005 AFL season and a further 21 in the 2006 AFL season. In the latter stages of 2005, Tambling struggled with injury, including a broken toe and a consistent hamstring problem. By 2009 the constant criticism of the underperforming midfielder reached new heights in the round 3 match between the Western Bulldogs and the Richmond Tigers. Tambling's game was viewed by many experts as one of the worst performances of faltering career due to the amount of costly turnovers from his small total of 12 possessions. He received a bronx cheer from the Richmond fans after getting his first kick which also happened to be a turnover. Coach Terry Wallace later explained that Tambling had become a father in the two days earlier, which had affected his sleep before the match.Matt Burgan (13 April 2009) Wallace defends quiet Tambling Tambling was dropped from the Richmond team for the following match against the Demons. After a week at Coburg, he returned to the AFL in arguably the best form of his career.

The concept of proportionality is used as a criterion of fairness and justice in statutory interpretation processes, especially in constitutional law, as a logical method intended to assist in discerning the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act. Within criminal law, it is used to convey the idea that the punishment of an offender should fit the crime. Under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, proportionality and distinction are important factors in assessing military necessity. History The principle of guilt is an absolute standard on which the 17th century Bloody Code of England emerged, which specified the death penalty even for minor crimes. In the 18th century Cesare Beccaria published On Crimes and Punishments which was to form the basis of penology based on the relative standard of culpability. As a result Jeremy Bentham developed the idea of the panopticon in which prisoners would simply be watched, rather than subjected to corporal punishment. The idea in practice became a cruel and ineffective corrective. A more sophisticated concept of proportionality that was testable in law was first developed in the High State Administrative Courts () in Germany in the late 19th century, to review actions by the police. The proportionality test originated systematically with the jurisprudence of the German Constitutional Court, the .BVerfGE 3, 383, 399 (1954) European Union law In European Union law there are generally acknowledged to be four stages to a proportionality test, namely,P Craig and G de Burca, EU Law (5th edn OUP 2011) 526 * there must be a legitimate aim for a measure * the measure must be suitable to achieve the aim (potentially with a requirement of evidence to show it will have that effect) * the measure must be necessary to achieve the aim, that there cannot be any less onerous way of doing it * the measure must be reasonable, considering the competing interests of different groups at hand It is, however, often seen that the third and fourth criterion are often merged into one by the European Court of Justice, depending on the margin of discretion that the Court sees as being afforded to the member state. Examples are found in R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment, where the ECJ points out that a member state has some discretion in the policies it pursues, surrounding unfair dismissal, in reducing unemployment. Further examples of the proportionality test are seen in Mangold v Helm and K√ºc√ºkdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG. Australia While the European Union has placed a consistent focus on the proportionality test in the context of policy issues, namely human rights, the proportionality test in the Australian context is a matter of constitutional interpretation with respect to legislative power under the Constitution. Unlike Europe, the proportionality test as a means to characterize whether Commonwealth legislation falls under a head of power under section 51 of the Constitution of Australia,. has attracted divergent viewpoints, in which Kirby J has remarked that the 'test has not enjoyed universal favour'.. However, Owen Dixon CJ made clear that 'the question is essentially one of connexion, not appropriateness of proportionality, and where a sufficient connexion is established, it is not for the Court to judge whether the law is inappropriate or disproportionate'.. Criminal law In criminal law, the principle of proportional justice is used to describe the idea that the punishment of a certain crime should be in proportion to the severity of the crime itself. In practice, systems of law differ greatly on the application of this principle. In some systems, this was interpreted as lex talionis, (an eye for an eye). In others, it has led to a more restrictive manner of sentencing. For example, all European Union countries have accepted as a treaty obligation that no crime warrants the death penalty, whereas some other countries in the world do use it. In self-defense cases, the amount of force employed by the defender must be proportionate to the threatened aggressive force. If deadly force is used to defend against non-deadly force, the harm inflicted by the actor (death or serious bodily harm) will be greater than the harm avoided (less than serious bodily harm). Even if deadly force is proportionate, its use must be necessary. Otherwise, unlawful conduct will only be justified when it involves the lesser harm of two harmful choices. If countering with non-deadly force or with no force at all avoids the threatened harm, defensive use of deadly force is no longer the lesser evil of only two choices. Alternatives involving still less societal harm are available. In United States Law, the United States Supreme Court proposed the Proportionality Doctrine in three cases during the 1980s, namely Enmund v. Florida (1982), Solem v. Helm (1983) and Tison v. Arizona (1987), to clarify this key principle of proportionality within the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The fundamental principle behind proportionality is that the punishment should fit the crime. In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that courts must do three things to decide whether a sentence is proportional to a specific crime: # Compare the nature and gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty, # Compare the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; i.e., whether more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty or to less serious penalties, and # Compare the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions. Proportionality is also present in other areas of municipal law, such as civil procedure. For example, it is embodied in Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C), which considers whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Proportionality is a key consideration in the discovery process, and has been applied to e-discovery, where it has been attributed with significant cost- savings. It is likely that proportionality will be applied to new and developing areas of law, such as the law of legal technology. International humanitarian law The harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not \\"excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated\\" by an attack on a military objective.Article 52 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides a widely accepted definition of military objective: \\"In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage\\", Luis Moreno-Ocampo was the Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court who investigated allegations of war crimes during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He published an open letter containing his findings; in a section titled \\"Allegations concerning War Crimes\\", he elucidates this use of proportionality: See also * Civilian casualty ratio * Convention on Cybercrime * Let the punishment fit the crime * R. v.

He retired in 1935 as a brigadier. Early life and career James Heane was born in Sydney, New South Wales, on 29 December 1874, the son of Emily and her husband, also a James Heane, both of whom were immigrants from England. He received his schooling at Dubbo Superior Public School and then Sydney Boys High School. After completing his education, he became a certified auditor. He later took up farming in the Dubbo district. Heane joined the local militia in 1899 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Australian Infantry Regiment. He had previously served in the Cadet Corps for five years. In 1903 and now a lieutenant, he joined the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. When compulsory military training was introduced in Australia in 1910, Heane was appointed area officer in Dubbo. First World War On 3 September 1914, Heane was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force with the rank of captain as a company commander in the 4th Infantry Battalion. After the battalion was reorganised in Egypt, Heane was given command of D Company and promoted to major. Heane went ashore at Anzac late in the morning of 25 April 1915 and formed Major General William Bridges last reserve until it was committed to the fighting at Lone Pine late in the afternoon. Heane earned the nickname \\"Cast Iron Jimmy\\" for his gallantry under fire in the fighting at Lone Pine on the 26th, when the 4th Battalion moved across the 400 Plateau and occupied Johnson's Jolly for a time, Heane returning from there after dark. On 1 May, Heane led a company forward under fire to support a small force. For this he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the 1915 Birthday Honours and Mentioned in Despatches. He was wounded three times: in the thumb on 2 July; in the mouth; and then in the attack on Lone Pine on 7 August 1915. He was wounded so badly at Lone Pine that he was evacuated and hospitalised finally rejoining his battalion at Tel el Kebir, Egypt, in January 1916. Heane was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 1st Infantry Battalion, which he took to the Western Front. On 23 July 1916, the battalion was committed to the line at Pozi√®res, advancing through the town itself. Afterwards, Heane personally walked the whole front and carefully thinned out the line so that the minimum number of men would be exposed to the enemy artillery when it discovered their location. In the fighting, the 1st Battalion lost 13 officers and 473 other ranks, about half its strength. For his leadership at Pozi√®res, Heane was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. During 1916, Heane had been acting commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade twice. On 3 December 1916, he was promoted to full colonel and temporary brigadier general and given command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. But on 7 December, after going up to the front line and crossing several empty and apparently unused saps that were little more than ditches half filled with muddy slime, Heane found himself in a trench occupied by German soldiers. Realising that he had made a grave mistake, Heane headed for the Australian lines but was wounded in the head before he reached it. He was evacuated to England. Heane rejoined his unit in January 1917, and led in his brigade the Battles of Bullecourt, Menin Road, Broodseinde, Passchendaele, Lys, Lihons and Chuignes. For his services in command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, Heane was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and Mentioned in Despatches five more times. Post-war In March 1919, Heane took over the 1st Division Demobilisation Group at Tidworth Camp. He returned to Australia where his appointment to the AIF ended on 7 January 1920. In July 1920 he took over command of the 11th Infantry Brigade. From April 1921 to June 1926 he commanded the 5th Infantry Brigade. He was also honorary colonel of the 4th Battalion from 1926 until he was transferred to the retired list as an honorary brigadier in 1935. During the Second World War he was commander of the Volunteer Defence Corps in New South Wales from 1940 to 1942. Heane settled on a large citrus orchard in West Pennant Hills, New South Wales. From 1922 to 1941 he was also president of the Fruitgrowers' Federation of New South Wales. He died on 20 August 1954 and was cremated. See also List of Australian generals Notes References *J. G.

Like Condorrat, Castlecary and Luggiebank, it predates the new town of Cumbernauld, and of those only Condorrat was officially included in the designated area. Its name is anglicised from the Gaelic Dubh Leitir, which means \\"dark slope\\". The route of the Antonine Wall passes just to the north of Dullatur. Two Roman temporary marching camps were located at Dullatur between the forts at Croy Hill and Westerwood. The camps have been excavated several times by archaeologists following aerial photography and proposed housebuilding. Both camps have now been built over, and no visible remains can be seen on the ground today. Digital reconstructions of the larger and the smaller of the camps have been created. When building the nearby Forth and Clyde Canal in the 18th century a number of finds were made in Dullatur Bog. Thomas Watson recorded: \\"a number of swords, pistols, and other weapons were dug out; also the bodies of men and horses, and what seems somewhat marvellous, a trooper, completely armed, and seated on his horse, in the exact posture in which he had perished.\\" It was supposed that the man was escaping the Battle of Kilsyth which is due north of Dullatur Bog. The development of the village owed much to the creation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line, with a station sited in Dullatur in 1842 to encourage commuters to settle there. Several grand villas were built as part of the original development, two of which were designed by the architect Alexander \\"Greek\\" Thomson. The make-up of the village was of the higher socio-economic class, and early recreational developments included Dullatur Golf Club and lawn-tennis clubs, both of which persist to the present day. Dullatur railway station is now closed but the village still serves as a commuter settlement, with a number of private properties being built over the years.

Having started his professional career at Rotherham United in 1996, he first made a name for himself as Blackpool's first choice goalkeeper from 1997 to 2004. He notched up 141 league appearances during his spell with the club which earned him a move to Sheffield United. Despite being primarily used as back-up to Paddy Kenny, Barnes was part of the United squad that earned promotion to the Premier League in 2006. Before this he had also spent time on loan with both Torquay United and Queens Park Rangers. Following the Blades promotion, Barnes signed for Grimsby Town where he remained for two years and was the Supporters Player of the Season for the 2007‚Äì08 season. Following a change in management and a drop in Grimsby's fortunes he was released a few weeks from the end of the following season and joined Conference North club Gainsborough Trinity for the final day of the season. In the summer he signed for Trinity on a permanent contract and remained with the Holy Blues for two seasons before signing for Alfreton Town in the summer of 2012. After a year with Alfreton, Barnes re- signed for Gainsborough. After moving from Gainsborough Barnes joined Harrogate Town for one season before joining Buxton in August 2015. After leaving Buxton in June 2016 he signed for Matlock Town. Career =Rotherham United= Barnes started his career at Rotherham United, making his debut against York City in April 1997. \\"Rotherham 0, York 2. TEENAGE keeper Phil Barnes made sure York fought every inch of the way before ensuring their Second Division survival. Barnes, 18, making his debut, pulled off a string of saves to keep already-relegated Rotherham in the match. York's Tony Barras said: \\"I could have had four goals if it hadn't been for the keeper.\\" He made two appearances for Rotherham in total. =Blackpool= Barnes then made a move to Blackpool in August 1997 for a fee of ¬£100,000, as cover for Steve Banks, but eventually made the position his own. Following Blackpool's relegation to the Third Division in May 2000, Barnes signed a three-year contract keeping him at the club until the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. \\"Goalkeeper Phil Barnes has finally signed a new contract to keep him at Bloomfield Road until the end of the 2002/3 campaign. Barnes was offered terms before the season ended, but wanted to concentrate on the relegation battle before signing.\\" He contributed a number of clean sheets to the Bloomfield Road club's promotion campaign, helping them to promotion to Division Two via the play-offs in May 2001. After losing his place in the first team, Barnes requested a transfer in November 2003. Having made 170 appearances in all competitions for Blackpool he left the club. In 2002 he started the final as Blackpool won the 2001‚Äì02 Football League Trophy. In 2004 Blackpool won the Football League Trophy again but this time he was an unused substitute in the final. =Sheffield United= He then joined Sheffield United on a free transfer in July 2004, signing a one-year contract, as cover for Paddy Kenny. A regular for the reserves but making just five first-team appearances, he also went out on loan spells at Torquay United and Queens Park Rangers. \\"QPR did not have a goalkeeper until Holloway completed the loan signing of Phil Barnes from Sheffield United on the morning of the match [against Leeds]\\". Barnes was part of the United squad that earned promotion to the Premier League in the 2005‚Äì06 campaign. =Grimsby Town= In June 2006, Barnes signed a three-year contract with Grimsby Town for an undisclosed fee, to replace Steve Mildenhall after his transfer to Yeovil Town. He was named the Grimsby Supporters' Player of the Year for 2007‚Äì08. At the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Barnes had made over 100 appearances in all competitions for Grimsby. Barnes started the 2008‚Äì09 season by being in the League Two Team of the Week, then he was in the team of the week again for his performance against Shrewsbury Town. Later in the season after getting a throat infection Mariners manager Mike Newell was forced to replace Barnes, and in turn swooped to sign on loan Preston North End keeper Wayne Henderson to replace him. Barnes was then made available for loan, and on 24 March, Newell rejected a loan move from Shrewsbury Town for him after the two clubs could not agree on a deal regarding wages. On 25 March, Barnes left Grimsby after being told he was no longer needed by the club, his understudy Gary Montgomery was also released. The Mariners saw out the 2008‚Äì09 campaign with Henderson and former Leeds United player Jonny Lund, as the club's two professional keepers. =Non- League= Barnes joined Conference North club Gainsborough Trinity on a non- contract terms in April 2009 after the club needed an emergency goalkeeper to cover for the injured Adam Sollitt, making his debut in the final game of the 2008‚Äì09 season, a 3‚Äì2 victory over Harrogate Town. Trinity manager Steve Charles praised Barnes as he was given Man of the Match in the game, but commented signing Barnes for the 2009‚Äì10 season was unlikely due to the players desire to play at a professional level.http://sportsecho.co.uk/football/gainsborough_trinity/news/displayarticle.php?ID=7015 Despite this though, Barnes signed a permanent contract for the club on 9 June 2009 as well as the club signing Darryn Stamp on the same day. Barnes was joined at Trinity by a vast number of professionals as new chairman Peter Swann boosted the club's finances to sign a higher calibre of players. Barnes would start the 2009‚Äì10 season off as the club's number 1 keeper. The Holy Blues appointed Brian Little as manager who in turn brought in former Premiership keeper Gavin Ward as his Assistant Manager and second choice keeper. During the 2011‚Äì12 campaign a mid season injury sidelined Barnes for the remainder of the season. His understudy Andy Pettinger was also forced on to the sidelines, with the club having to bring in Dimitar Evtimov from Nottingham Forest on loan before signing youngster Michael Emery to deputise. Before the end of the season Trinity brought in a new first choice keeper in Jason White meaning Barnes was not offered a new contract at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season but instead was invited back to pre-season training to prove his fitness, however he declined the offer and left the club. It was announced on 28 June 2012 that Barnes had joined Conference National side Alfreton Town. Initially used as Town's first choice keeper, the club chose to loan in Jon Stewart from Burnley, however when Stewart's loan expired in late December, Barnes regained the number 1 spot. Barnes played 18 times for the club and was released at the end of the season. On 23 May 2013 it was announced Barnes had re-signed for Gainsborough.

When the Turks broke through the line into Quinn's Post on 29 May 1915, the temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harold Pope, ordered Herring to make a counterattack, which he fully expected would be extremely costly. Just as Herring was about to order the charge, there was a sudden burst of enemy fire, which abruptly almost ceased. Herring gave the word and his men charged across the open and made it practically unscathed, their attack having coincided with a Turkish assault further down the line and in a location where the Turkish machine gunners could not fire without hitting their own men. The remaining Turks in the post eventually surrendered. Herring was slightly wounded on 17 May 1915 but remained on duty. On 27 June 1915, he assumed acting command of the 13th Infantry Battalion after the battalion commander, Major Durrant was evacuated sick. Herring was confirmed as commander on 26 August 1915. On 15 October 1915, he was evacuated to Egypt sick, returning to his unit at Anzac on 19 November 1915. For his services at Anzac, Herring was mentioned in despatches. On 3 January 1916, Herring arrived in Alexandria with the 13th Battalion following the evacuation of Anzac. On 21 February 1916, the battalion was split, half going to form the new 45th Infantry Battalion. Herring took command of the new battalion, while Durrant resumed command of the old. Unfortunately, the new battalions soon had to absorb large numbers of men unwanted by the old battalions and left behind when they moved to France. On 12 March 1916, he became a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to the rank on 24 June 1916. The 45th Battalion departed Alexandria on 2 June 1916, arriving at Marseilles on 8 June. In August, the battalion was committed to the fighting at Pozi√®res, losing 448 men on its first tour. For his leadership at Pozi√®res, Herring was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). At Messines in June 1917, the battalion lost 568 men in pillbox fighting on the Oosttaverne Line. Herring, who had ordered repeated attacks on pillboxes that his men could not capture, was again mentioned in dispatches. On 24 September 1917 he became a brevet major in the AMF. On 7 October 1917, Herring took over command of No. 4 Training Group in England. This group was responsible for training the brigade's reinforcements. The group was abolished on 8 November 1917, and Herring assumed responsibility for the 3rd Training Battalion. On 7 May 1918, he returned to France where he resumed command of the 45th Battalion. On 26 June 1918 he became commander of the 13th Infantry Brigade and was promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general on 30 June 1918. The brigade played an important part in the final campaign under his leadership. He was mentioned in despatches for the fourth time and made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 3 June 1919. Post-war Herring resumed his career as real estate agent, and ran unsuccessfully for the Senate as a Nationalist in 1924. He was placed on the retired list in 1946 with the honorary rank of brigadier. For many years he led the 4th Division in Sydney's Anzac Day parades. He died on 27 May 1951 and was cremated with full military honours.

After attending school in Sydney, and university in Sydney, Canberra and Lismore, New South Wales, Heilpern became a solicitor and barrister. He is the author of For Fear of Favour: Sexual Assault of Young Prisoners, a prominent study of sexual assault in prisons, and has been an advocate of prison and law reform. In 1998 he became one of the youngest Magistrates in New South Wales. In 2004 he was awarded Southern Cross University's Alumnus of the Decade Award. Early life and education Heilpern is the son of former Byron Shire Councillor, Sandra Heilpern. He initially attended Lane Cove Public School in Sydney, but his parents became concerned when the \\"school suggested that I needed to conform more, and told my parents that my rebellion was so regular that I needed to see a psychiatrist\\". He transferred to nearby independent democratic school Currambena in 1970. Recounting his memory of the alternative education he received there, he remarked: > Currambena was a revolution for me. I was asked questions about what I > wanted to do each day. I learnt because I wanted to learn...The lessons of > Currambena stayed with me as I did well at school, became a criminal lawyer, > then the youngest head of a law school, then the youngest Magistrate in New > South Wales...I can honestly attribute much of my success to my years at > Currambena, for it gave me a love of learning that seems so rare these days, > especially among boys. Heilpern studied law in Sydney and Canberra, and undertook postgraduate study at Southern Cross University, completing a Masters of Law by Research in 1998. In 2004, he was the joint recipient of that university's Alumnus of the Decade Award. Career Heilpern became a solicitor and barrister with the Australian Government Solicitor and in private practice, specialising in criminal law. Working on the New South Wales north coast, he was one of a group who prompted the establishment of a law degree at Southern Cross University, and he taught in the program, becoming the Deputy Head of School. In 1998, or early 1999, he became one of the youngest Magistrates in New South Wales. As a young barrister, Heilpern rose to prominence following the publication of a study of sexual assault amongst young men in prisons. Heilpern interviewed 300 prisoners aged between 18 and 25, finding that around half reported experiencing assault in jail, with about a quarter being sexually assaulted. Australian High Court justice, Michael Kirby praised Heilpern's book, pointing out that while it made for unpleasant reading, it raised urgent issues of public policy. He also praised it for giving prisoners voice in their own words, saying that most of the statements recorded by Heilpern \\"have the ring of truth\\". The book received international notice, including in the US Congress, where it was \\"the only book included in submissions for what was to become a bipartisan, unanimous bill in both houses to reduce prison rape\\". Much of Heilpern's work has been as an advocate for, and defender of, disadvantaged groups. In an article in the Alternative Law Journal, he wrote praising the work of single mothers in seeking to keep children, particularly young men, out of trouble with the law and criticising the lack of resources available to them. In 1999, Heilpern was Dubbo Local Court magistrate when a case of a young Indigenous man came before the court, charged with using offensive language to a police officer, having told two officers to \\"fuck off\\" when they sought to take into custody a bicycle he was riding. Heilpern threw out the police case, in a decision that had implications for the treatment of offensive language by the courts, as well as highlighting the extent to which the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody were not being implemented in such examples. Of his own career and life, he has said he has been part of the prison reform, drug law reform and environment movements. Ten years after conducting his study on prisoner sexual assault, he argued that conditions in prisons continued to deteriorate, and argued for the protection of prisoners' rights. In 2006 he presided over the bail hearing of a high-profile assault case involving a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.Iron Bar Attack (Sydney Morning Herald) Heilpern is the author of over twenty journal articles and four books.

Its field of study is information: how it is created, identified, collected, structured, managed, preserved, accessed, processed, and presented; how it is used in different environments, with different technologies, and over time. The school's stated mission is: \\"We create and share knowledge so that people can use information -- with technology -- to build a better world. \\" Its slogan is \\"connecting people, information, and technology in more valuable ways.\\" The School of Information is part of a growing list of i-schools devoted to the study of information as a discipline. These institutions have varied histories, some being newly created, others developing from earlier schools or departments focused on library and information science (as with SI), computer science, communications, or information technology. SI was the first of these institutions to relabel itself as a \\"school of information.\\" It is currently housed in the North Quadrangle on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus. In 2008, the School of Information, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and the College of Engineering unveiled a new undergraduate major called Informatics.https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/SI%40umichfa08_0.pdf In 2011, the School of Information and the School of Public Health announced the creation of a master's degree in health informatics. In 2014, the School of Information enrolled its first students for a bachelor's degree in Information. Undergraduate degree alt=Red brick facade with white stone fronts and angled roof Since 2008, the University of Michigan has offered a bachelor's degree in Informatics.https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/SI%40umichfa08_0.pdf Informatics is housed in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in cooperation with the College of Engineering and the School of Information and gives students a solid grounding in information systems, statistics, mathematics and computer programming. Students are able to specialize in one of five tracks: Social Computing, Data Mining & Information Analysis, Computational, Internet, and Life Sciences. Depending on the track chosen, students are prepared for many career paths, including business, research, government, computer programming, education and non-profit organizations. In 2014, the School of Information announced that it would begin to offer an undergraduate degree, with students pursuing this degree graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Information (BSI). Due to this change, it was decided that the Social Computing and Computational tracks of the Informatics program would be phased out, with the final class of the degree graduating in May 2015, as the BSI program would be teaching similar concepts. In August 2014, the \\"First Class\\" of BSI students began their learning in this new program, under the direction of director John L. King. Students in this program complete a series of core courses and electives, as well as courses that allow them to graduate specializing in either Designing for the User Experience or Information Analytics. This interdisciplinary degree focuses on the social/behavioral and technological sciences. Students will takes classes in mathematics, communications, statistics and history, and upon graduation will successfully compete for jobs in science, business, government, education, technology, and entertainment. Graduates looking to continue their education are encouraged to continue their studies in graduate programs. Students graduating with a BSI have the tools and know-how for a successful future in companies and nonprofit organizations such as Facebook, Apple, Cisco, Microsoft, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Deloitte, Bank of America, Google, National Public Radio, and the Smithsonian Institution. High school students may apply to this program \\"preferred admission\\" when applying to The University of Michigan, or students already enrolled at The University of Michigan may apply to transfer into the program beginning in their Junior year. The goal of the BSI program is \\"To build a community of students who are diverse and multi-dimensional, self-starters who will contribute both in the classroom and in the field\\" and look for students with strong transcripts that reflect good grades and appropriate course selections, engagement with community and/or campus organizations, and demonstrated leadership capacity. Graduates of this program will come out with at least 120 University of Michigan credits, at least 60 of which are upper level and of which 45 are offered by the School of Information. Three core courses are required for the program: Agile Web Development, Models of Social Information Processing, and Information Environments and Work, and are supplemented with elective courses in topics such as graphic design, eCommunities, persuasion and social influence, cyberscience, and the history of the Internet. Master's degree The Master of Science in Information (MSI) degree is a 48-credit hour professional degree built on a core curriculum of \\"foundations\\" courses that synthesize content and methodology from library and information science, computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences. Real-world engagement is a hallmark of the master's program: all students are required to complete internships or mentorships in the field. The MSI program is highly interdisciplinary, featuring faculty from a wide range of academic fields. It draws students from diverse undergraduate majors, ranging from the arts and humanities to science and engineering. Master's students may specialize in the following areas: * Archives and Records Management (ARM) * Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) * Information Economics for Management (IEM) * Library and Information Science (LIS) * Information Analysis and Retrieval (IAR) * Preservation of Information (PI) * Social computing (SC) * School Library Media (SLM) Students may also opt for a self-designed curriculum under the guidance of a faculty member. In 2011, the School of Information and the School of Public Health offered a new join graduate program in Health Informatics. The first class graduated in the Fall of 2012. Students in the Health Informatics program take 52 credits specializing in epidemiology, health management and policy, and health behavior and education from the School of Public Health, combined with the design and evaluation of effective information systems learned in the School of Information.  Master's of Applied Data Science on Coursera  As of 2019, the School of Information offers a 34-credit, 100% online Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) degree in partnership with Coursera. The degree is designed for people who want to become a data scientist by learning skills from hands-on projects. The MADS curriculum entails mastering core data science concepts like machine learning and natural language processing, diving deep on key topics such as privacy, data ethics, and persuasive communication. The MADS program is a unique degree geared toward building practical experience and creating a portfolio of work geared for professional development. While other Data Science master's degrees focus on computer science theory, this degree equips students for leadership with an end-to-end perspective on data science. Students go from contextual inquiry to data visualization and presentation, and become prepared to solve real-world problems. Students will need basic proficiency in statistics and Python to start the degree. The school teaches comprehensive applied data science at the intersection of people and technology, providing critical insight into data collection, computation, and analytics, and helping develop hands-on skills using a multidisciplinary approach embedded in information, computer science, and statistics. Courses cover, in summary: * Computational methods to deal with big data * Exploring and communicating data * Visualizing data using multiple methods * Analytic techniques (machine learning, network analysis, natural language processing, experiments and causal inference, etc.) * Data science application in context (search and recommender systems, social media analytics, learning analytics, etc.) * 3 portfolio-building major projects Classes are offered in one-credit, four-week course modules. The MADS degree is offered only in online format. The degree diploma and transcript are identical in form to the other graduate programs from the fully accredited University of Michigan School of Information and do not differentiate between residential and online. The MADS degree was developed in collaboration with the U-M Office of Academic Innovation to meet the growing demand for people with experience in applied data science. The degree received approval from the Michigan Association of State Universities at its October 12, 2018 meeting. This is first online degree offered by the School of Information and one of the first offered by the University of Michigan. Doctoral degree The school's doctoral program is a full-time course of study, typically four years post-baccalaureate, leading to the Doctor of Information (Ph.D.). The program is designed to enable students to engage in advanced study and research in a various information fields such as the economics of information, human- computer interaction, library and information services, organizational issues, archives and records management, new systems architecture, digital libraries, information systems management, and digital documents/digital publishing. Faculty and research Faculty at the school are drawn from an unusually wide range of academic backgrounds including linguistics, public policy, computer science, library and information science, management, law, business, economics, psychology, history, and communications. The school's faculty and students are active in research, pursuing projects in various areas and methods. Their stated goal is to develop an integrated understanding of human needs in relation to information systems and social structures, searching for unifying principles that illuminate the role of information in computation, cognition, communication, and community. The school's infrastructure includes a range of research facilities and equipment. Researchers also have access to a number of off-campus research sites. Projects are often collaborations with researchers from other units at the university. Established and emerging areas of research at the school include: * archives and records management * collaboratories * community informatics * community technology * digital humanities * digital libraries * digital preservation * documenting cultural heritage and social memory * electronic commerce * health informatics * human- computer interaction * human-information interaction * incentive-centered design * information access * information analysis and retrieval * information and organizational systems * information architecture * information behavior and use * information diffusion * information economics * information filtering * information infrastructure * information policy * information retrieval * information systems * information use in communities * information visualization and representation * knowledge management * library and information services * library science * natural language processing * network theory * organizational learning * organizational productivity * pervasive and ubiquitous computing * social capital * technology-mediated collaboration * telecommunications policy * trust and recommender systems * user-centered design History Before 1992, the School of Information was the School of Information and Library Studies. In 1992, the president of the University of Michigan, James Duderstadt appointed Daniel E. Atkins III as the dean of the school. Under the direction of Dr. Atkins and with support from Duderstadt and W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the school became the School of Information with the intent to reach beyond traditional library science arena. The School of Information was officially established in 1996 offering a master's of science in information with some specializations (library and information science, archives and record management, human computer interaction, information economics management and policy, and a tailored program).Olson, Gary M. and Jonathan Grudin. \\"The Information School Phenomenon.\\" Interaction March/April 2009, p. 15-9.

He was the godfather of Peter I of Russia. Under Tsar Michael's rule Aleksey Trubetskoy was in disfavour with the powerful Patriarch Filaret and was appointed to govern distant towns of Tobolsk and Astrakhan. But the situation changed after Michael's death in 1645 and Alexis I's succession to the throne, when Trubetskoy's close friend Boris Morozov became a head of government. In 1646, Trubetskoy was appointed a commander of the Tsar's personal Guard regiment. Aleksey Trubetskoy was the godfather of Peter I of Russia. Young Peter with royal regalia. In 1654, Prince Aleksey Trubetskoy on the side of Alexis I of Russia led the southern flank of the Russian army from Bryansk to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Presently most quitlines treat tobacco or alcohol addiction. Quitlines are treatment centres that offer advanced treatment and should not be confused with call centres. Smoking cessation quitlines Tobacco quitlines have proven to be comparable to cessation clinics in terms of proportion of smokers smoke-free at follow-up but are more cost effective. A 2008 meta-analysis by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, found that quitline counseling increased the estimated long-run (>6 months) abstinence rate to 12.7% compared to 8.5% of smokers attempting to quit on their own; when combined with medication, the estimated long-run abstinence rate increased to 28.1% compared to 23.2% for just medication alone, a \\"robust effect\\". The treatment protocol in most tobacco cessation quitlines is a mixture of motivational interviewing, behaviour therapy, and pharmacological consultation. Quitline numbers are presently printed on cigarette packages in several countries as a part of the health warning labels. Tobacco quitlines may offer a reactive service, meaning that counselors initiate no contact but clients signing up for support are encouraged to call the service whenever they need. Or a proactive service where clients signing up for treatment are offered a call up service. Many quitlines offer both reactive and proactive treatments and leave it up to the client to choose. Alcohol quitlines Telephone based advice (call centres) for alcoholics and their relatives are relatively common and some are gradually developing into telephone based treatment centres. However, alcohol quitlines are still at their infancy. In Sweden where telephone-based treatment for tobacco addiction is well established, an advanced alcohol treatment quitline (first of its kind) opened in January 2007.

He was mortally wounded by a German artillery shell while surveying the ground won at the Battle of Messines. Early life and career Holmes was born in Sydney on 12 September 1862, the son of Captain William Holmes, the chief clerk at New South Wales Military Forces Headquarters, and Jane Holmes. Holmes lived in the Victoria Barracks and was educated at Paddington Public School. In 1872 at the age of 10 Holmes joined the 1st Infantry Regiment of the New South Wales Military Forces as a bugler and served in every enlisted rank. Holmes worked at the Sydney Mint and then joined the Department of Works as a clerk on 24 June 1878. On 24 August 1887, he married Susan Ellen Green, whose family also lived in the Victoria Barracks. They had two children, one son and one daughter. On 20 April 1888 he became chief clerk and paymaster of the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. Under his leadership, the department underwent a major expansion and the Cataract, Cordeaux and Avon dams were built. Holmes served for 18 months in a submarine mining company before returning to the regiment and being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1886. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1890, captain in 1894 and major in 1900. Boer War In 1899, Holmes volunteered for service in South Africa. The company left for South Africa in November 1899, and on arrival was incorporated in the Australian Regiment. Originally an infantry unit, it became mounted in February. He saw action at Colesberg, Pretoria and Diamond Hill in June 1900, where he was wounded. Holmes was mentioned in despatches, promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). He returned home in August 1900. Holmes commanded the 1st Australian Infantry from 1902 to 1911. He was promoted to colonel on 6 January 1912 and was appointed to command the 6th Infantry Brigade. First World War During the First World War, Holmes served first as Commander of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF;), and later as Commander of the 5th Brigade, which he took to Gallipoli and the Western Front. =German New Guinea= Shortly after war broke out, a special expeditionary force, the AN&MEF;, was formed to occupy German possessions in New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. Holmes was appointed the commander. Under Holmes command the force sailed from Sydney on the auxiliary cruiser on 19 August 1914. The German governor surrendered to Holmes on 12 September 1914 and the British flag was raised over the town. Holmes was criticised in Australia for offering extremely lenient terms, but he was under orders to occupy, not annex, German New Guinea. Holmes became administrator of New Guinea. He relinquished the post to Colonel Samuel Pethebridge in January 1915 and returned to Australia, where his appointment to the AN&MEF; was terminated on 6 February 1915. =Gallipoli= On 16 March 1915, Holmes was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force as commander of the newly formed 5th Brigade with the rank of colonel. The brigade left Sydney in May and arrived in Egypt in June 1915, where it became part of the 2nd Division. The 5th Brigade began moving to Gallipoli in early August and Holmes arrived on the 19th. The brigade was placed at the disposal of Major General Alexander Godley of the New Zealand and Australian Division and elements participated in the fighting for Hill 60. The 5th Brigade took over the trenches facing the Nek from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on 28 August 1915. Holmes made a habit of regularly visiting every key part of his front lines. When Major General James Legge fell ill in November and was evacuated, Holmes took over acting command of the 2nd Division. He was still in temporary command of the division in December 1915, when they were amongst the last of the Anzac troops to be evacuated from Gallipoli. =Western Front= After the evacuation of Anzac, Holmes returned to the 5th Brigade, which he took to the Western Front in April 1916. He led the brigade in the attacks on the Pozi√®res Heights in August and at Flers in October 1916. In January 1917, Holmes was given command of the 4th Division, replacing Major General Vaughan Cox. Holmes continued his habit of personally reconnoitring every part of his line. On 31 March 1917, he paid a daylight visit to an outpost near Lagnicourt, as usual wearing his red hat band, accompanied by his aide, Lieutenant Fergusson. Holmes was sniped at but not hit; Fergusson was hit and had to be left behind, to be evacuated after nightfall. Shortly afterwards the post was shelled, causing heavy casualties to the garrison, including Fergusson who was injured for a second time. Holmes commanded his division at Bullecourt in April, where he opposed the operation that ultimately caused his division very heavy losses, and at Messines in June. On 2 July 1917, Holmes took the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman, to survey the Messines battlefield. The party left his car in order to avoid a dangerous corner, something Holmes usually would not do. As they set out on foot, a German shell, believed to be a seventy-seven, or a \\"pip-squeak\\" landed nearby and Holmes was hit through the chest and lung. His aide, Captain Maxwell, along with Frank Edwards the private secretary to Holman, took Holmes to the nearest aid post, where he died. He was buried at Trois Arbres Cemetery, Steenwerck, France. Holmes was the most senior Australian officer killed in action on the Western Front. A memorial service was held for him in October 1917 at St Matthias' Anglican Church, Paddington, the church where he and Susan were married. Memorial William Holmes Street in the Potts Hill Business Park, Potts Hill New South Wales is named after Major General William Holmes. Potts Hill Business Park is on the edge of the Potts Hill reservoir, a major water storage operated by Sydney Water. General Holmes Drive that runs between Botany Bay and Sydney Airport is named after him. Holmes Avenue, Clontarf, New South Wales, is also named after him.

It was originally transmitted on 10 October 1975. Synopsis The platoon begin a recruiting campaign, and Jones is chosen as the face for the poster. Unfortunately, due to a mistake at the printers, his face is on an escaped prisoner of war poster. Plot Wilson enters Mainwaring's office to find him writing a Confidential Report about him. Mainwaring shows it to him so he can sign it and make sure he is playing fair. Wilson scoffs at his attempts, comparing it to a headmaster's end-of- term report. Mainwaring is not quite so blas√©, and hints that the Confidential Report could lead to big changes. He hints that he may be promoted to Major very soon, and admits he wants to start a recruiting campaign to triple the platoon and turn it into a company. He convenes a parade and tells them of his plan. Jones suggests a poster similar to that of Lord Kitchener's recruitment poster, and Mainwaring is delighted with the suggestion. Jones then suggests a secret ballot to decide the face for the poster, and Frazer decides to bring in a professional photographer. Jones wins the ballot by a large margin and the photographer turns out to be Mr Blewitt. After four unsuccessful attempts, the photo is taken, and Wilson takes it round to the printers. At the printers, a police officer is asking for a Wanted poster of an escaped prisoner of war to be printed. The photo is placed on the out-tray along with Jones' photo on top. Two days later, Godfrey brings in a sample of the poster, and the platoon discover that the disorganised printer mixed the photographs up. Jones now appears to be a wanted man. Jones notices the poster outside a Free Polish Club (not, as Pike mistakenly believes, somewhere giving away free polish). A Polish Army major comes out, comments on the poster, \\"Ugly-looking swine,\\" and then sees Jones is the man on the poster. Jones is arrested and interrogated; despite his protests, the major persists in believing Jones is the escapee, and puts him in the local POW camp. Hodges drives Mainwaring and the rest of the platoon to the POW camp, where they too are arrested by the same major. Mainwaring puts his foot in it by declaring Jones is his colleague, and they are all placed in the POW camp with Jones. Wilson comments that the Colonel will not be very impressed with what happened, and wonders what he will write in Mainwaring's Confidential Report.

He is perhaps best known for his studies of 19th-century American novelists, in particular, Henry James and William Dean Howells. He is currently a professor of English at Pennsylvania State University and previously served as faculty advisor for the department's undergraduate honors program. He lives in State College, Pennsylvania, where he was born, and also in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Educated at Penn State and Harvard, Anesko published in 1986 a study of the economic factors that shaped Henry James' literary career. Titled \\"Friction with the Market\\": Henry James and the Profession of Authorship, the book argued against the image of James as a mandarin artist who ignored the dictates of the marketplace. Anesko showed how James actively sought the best prices for his works, used literary agents extensively, and was not afraid to pit one publisher against another. The book also calculated James' income from his writings for each year of his career, and explored how James constructed the New York Edition (1907‚Äì1909) of his works. In 1997 Anesko published a complete collection of the correspondence between James and his friend and editor, William Dean Howells. The collection, Letters, Fictions, Lives: Henry James and William Dean Howells showed how the two writers' careers developed from their earliest days to eventual prominence in their profession. Again, the focus was on the interaction between professional demands and artistic development. Anesko‚Äôs next project, The French Face of Nathaniel Hawthorne: Monsieur de l‚ÄôAub√©pine and His Second Empire Critics (Ohio State, 2011), was a collaborative effort, featuring six essays originally published in French periodicals during Hawthorne‚Äôs lifetime and never before translated into English. The discovery that Henry James plagiarized some of them in his 1879 biographical study, Hawthorne, made this work even more compelling. The following year, Anesko published Monopolizing the Master: Henry James and the Politics of Modern Literary Scholarship (Stanford, 2012), a ground-breaking historical analysis of the attempts of others to shape and control Henry James‚Äôs posthumous reputation and cultural capital. Anesko is one of four general editors of the first scholarly edition of James‚Äôs work‚ÄîThe Complete Fiction of Henry James, being published by Cambridge University Press. His particular contribution to the series, The Portrait of a Lady, appeared in 2016. Anesko‚Äôs extensive editorial experience with this and another of James‚Äôs major titles (The Ambassadors) inspired his latest book, Generous Mistakes: Incidents of Error in Henry James (Oxford, 2017). In 2014 Anesko also became co-editor of The Complete Letters of Henry James, an on-going project of the University of Nebraska Press. Besides these books Anesko has contributed many articles to journals and anthologies on American literature, especially the 19th century realists. He is a past president of the Henry James Society (publisher of the Henry James Review). His research interests include the history of book publishing, authorship as a profession, and sociological aspects of literature.

Roosevelt was given during the handover ceremony of the Royal Norwegian Navy ship HNoMS King Haakon VII at the Washington Navy Yard on 16 September 1942. The speech served as an important source of inspiration to Norwegians fighting the German occupation of Norway and the rest of Europe as well as for the resistance fighters of other small countries during World War II. In the speech the President said: > If there is anyone who still wonders why this war is being fought, let him > look to Norway. If there is anyone who has any delusions that this war could > have been averted, let him look to Norway; and if there is anyone who doubts > the democratic will to win, again I say, let him look to Norway. The speech also made an impact on Norwegian-Americans and the rest of the American public's opinion on the struggle in Europe. The impression of the Norwegian's situation had been severely damaged by an article by the American reporter, Leland Stowe, who happened to be in Oslo on the day the Germans marched into the city. He witnessed shocked Norwegian civilians standing around watching the Germans march down the parade street Karl Johans gate. He misinterpreted the shock as indifference and acceptance on the part of the Norwegian population and wrote a stinging article in Time and several newspapers which severely damaged the American public's opinion of the Norwegian resistance and therefore their motivation to help Norway and Europe. The speech corrected that impression. In a speech on 13 April 1940, the President had already praised the Norwegian resistance movement. Roosevelt's interest in Norway was in part due to the good relations established by Norwegian Crown Prince Olav and his wife, Princess Martha, and the Norwegian ambassador to the U.S., Wilhelm Thorleif von Munthe af Morgenstierne (1887-1963).Never Lose Faith (Time magazine.

In each step, a variable is considered for addition to or subtraction from the set of explanatory variables based on some prespecified criterion. Usually, this takes the form of a sequence of F-tests or t-tests, but other techniques are possible, such as adjusted R2, Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, Mallows's Cp, PRESS, or false discovery rate. The frequent practice of fitting the final selected model followed by reporting estimates and confidence intervals without adjusting them to take the model building process into account has led to calls to stop using stepwise model building altogetherFlom, P.

For additional consideration, when planning an experiment, computer simulation, or scientific survey to collect data for this model, one must keep in mind the number of parameters, P, to estimate and adjust the sample size accordingly. For K variables, P = 1(Start) + K(Stage I) + (K2 ‚àí K)/2(Stage II) + 3K(Stage III) = 0.5K2 + 3.5K + 1\\\\. For K < 17, an efficient design of experiments exists for this type of model, a Box‚ÄìBehnken design,Box‚ÄìBehnken designs from a handbook on engineering statistics at NIST augmented with positive and negative axial points of length min(2, (int(1.5 + K/4))1/2), plus point(s) at the origin. There are more efficient designs, requiring fewer runs, even for K > 16. Main approaches The main approaches are: * Forward selection, which involves starting with no variables in the model, testing the addition of each variable using a chosen model fit criterion, adding the variable (if any) whose inclusion gives the most statistically significant improvement of the fit, and repeating this process until none improves the model to a statistically significant extent. * Backward elimination, which involves starting with all candidate variables, testing the deletion of each variable using a chosen model fit criterion, deleting the variable (if any) whose loss gives the most statistically insignificant deterioration of the model fit, and repeating this process until no further variables can be deleted without a statistically insignificant loss of fit. * Bidirectional elimination, a combination of the above, testing at each step for variables to be included or excluded. Selection criterion A widely used algorithm was first proposed by Efroymson (1960).Efroymson, MA (1960) \\"Multiple regression analysis.\\" In Ralston, A. and Wilf, HS, editors, Mathematical Methods for Digital Computers. Wiley. This is an automatic procedure for statistical model selection in cases where there is a large number of potential explanatory variables, and no underlying theory on which to base the model selection. The procedure is used primarily in regression analysis, though the basic approach is applicable in many forms of model selection. This is a variation on forward selection. At each stage in the process, after a new variable is added, a test is made to check if some variables can be deleted without appreciably increasing the residual sum of squares (RSS). The procedure terminates when the measure is (locally) maximized, or when the available improvement falls below some critical value. One of the main issues with stepwise regression is that it searches a large space of possible models. Hence it is prone to overfitting the data. In other words, stepwise regression will often fit much better in sample than it does on new out-of-sample data. Extreme cases have been noted where models have achieved statistical significance working on random numbers.Knecht, WR. (2005). Pilot willingness to take off into marginal weather, Part II: Antecedent overfitting with forward stepwise logistic regression. (Technical Report DOT/FAA/AM-O5/15). Federal Aviation Administration This problem can be mitigated if the criterion for adding (or deleting) a variable is stiff enough. The key line in the sand is at what can be thought of as the Bonferroni point: namely how significant the best spurious variable should be based on chance alone. On a t-statistic scale, this occurs at about \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\log p}, where p is the number of predictors. Unfortunately, this means that many variables which actually carry signal will not be included. This fence turns out to be the right trade-off between over- fitting and missing signal. If we look at the risk of different cutoffs, then using this bound will be within a 2logp factor of the best possible risk. Any other cutoff will end up having a larger such risk inflation.Foster, Dean P., & George, Edward I. (1994). The Risk Inflation Criterion for Multiple Regression. Annals of Statistics, 22(4). 1947‚Äì1975. Donoho, David L., & Johnstone, Jain M. (1994). Ideal spatial adaptation by wavelet shrinkage. Biometrika, 81(3):425‚Äì455. Model accuracy A way to test for errors in models created by step-wise regression, is to not rely on the model's F-statistic, significance, or multiple R, but instead assess the model against a set of data that was not used to create the model.Mark, Jonathan, & Goldberg, Michael A. (2001). Multiple regression analysis and mass assessment: A review of the issues. The Appraisal Journal, Jan., 89‚Äì109. This is often done by building a model based on a sample of the dataset available (e.g., 70%) ‚Äì the ‚Äútraining set‚Äù ‚Äì and use the remainder of the dataset (e.g., 30%) as a validation set to assess the accuracy of the model. Accuracy is then often measured as the actual standard error (SE), MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error), or mean error between the predicted value and the actual value in the hold-out sample.Mayers, J.H., & Forgy, E.W. (1963). The Development of numerical credit evaluation systems. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 58(303; Sept), 799‚Äì806. This method is particularly valuable when data are collected in different settings (e.g., different times, social vs. solitary situations) or when models are assumed to be generalizable. Criticism Stepwise regression procedures are used in data mining, but are controversial. Several points of criticism have been made. * The tests themselves are biased, since they are based on the same data.Rencher, A. C., & Pun, F. C. (1980). Inflation of R¬≤ in Best Subset Regression. Technometrics, 22, 49‚Äì54.Copas, J.B. (1983). Regression, prediction and shrinkage. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Series B, 45, 311‚Äì354. Wilkinson and Dallal (1981)Wilkinson, L., & Dallal, G.E. (1981). Tests of significance in forward selection regression with an F-to enter stopping rule. Technometrics, 23, 377‚Äì380. computed percentage points of the multiple correlation coefficient by simulation and showed that a final regression obtained by forward selection, said by the F-procedure to be significant at 0.1%, was in fact only significant at 5%. * When estimating the degrees of freedom, the number of the candidate independent variables from the best fit selected may be smaller than the total number of final model variables, causing the fit to appear better than it is when adjusting the r2 value for the number of degrees of freedom. It is important to consider how many degrees of freedom have been used in the entire model, not just count the number of independent variables in the resulting fit.Hurvich, C. M. and C. L. Tsai. 1990. The impact of model selection on inference in linear regression. American Statistician 44: 214‚Äì217. * Models that are created may be over- simplifications of the real models of the data.Roecker, Ellen B. (1991). Prediction error and its estimation for subset‚Äîselected models. Technometrics, 33, 459‚Äì468. Such criticisms, based upon limitations of the relationship between a model and procedure and data set used to fit it, are usually addressed by verifying the model on an independent data set, as in the PRESS procedure. Critics regard the procedure as a paradigmatic example of data dredging, intense computation often being an inadequate substitute for subject area expertise. Additionally, the results of stepwise regression are often used incorrectly without adjusting them for the occurrence of model selection. Especially the practice of fitting the final selected model as if no model selection had taken place and reporting of estimates and confidence intervals as if least-squares theory were valid for them, has been described as a scandal. Widespread incorrect usage and the availability of alternatives such as ensemble learning, leaving all variables in the model, or using expert judgement to identify relevant variables have led to calls to totally avoid stepwise model selection.

History Until the late eleventh century, this part of southwestern Wales was part of the Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth. After the death in 1093 of the king of Deheubarth, Rhys ap Tewdwr, in the Battle of Brecon, the Normans took advantage of the lack of leadership among the Welsh, and Norman forces seized much of South Wales. In 1102, following a failed revolt by many of these Normans against King Henry I of England (in favour of Henry's brother, Robert Curthose), the King re-organised the wider region surrounding the Daugleddau Estuary and Milford Haven, including the Penfro peninsula, as a single Marcher Lordship of Pembroke.

In Dungleddy, the Flemings settled under the leadership of a man named Wizo, who proceeded to build and live at Wiston Castle. Wizo began to grant estates from the land he had been given to his followers, and one such mesne lord was granted the land at Picton, which was three miles to the south of Wiston. This Fleming was not a great historical figure and his name is not recorded. The site chosen for the castle he built may have been on a mound a few hundred yards to the east of the present house, but in any event, the present building was in place by the end of the thirteenth century and was by then in the hands of the Wogan family, who were now the owners of Wiston Castle. The circumstances under which Picton Castle came to be owned by the Wogans is unclear, but it may have been through a failure to beget male heirs or through the marriage of an heiress to one of the Wogans. As a result of marriage, possibly the same one, the later Wogans also descend from Cadifor ap Collwyn, Lord of Dyfed in the time of Rhys ap Tewdwr;Edmund Burke, A genealogical and heraldic history of the commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank; but uninvested with heritable honours, entry for Philips of Picton-Castle Cadifor (and hence, later Wogans) was male-line descendant of the earlier kings of Dyfed, prior to its amalgamation into Deheubarth by the later House of Dinefwr (from which Rhys ap Tewdwr hailed).R. R. Davies, The Age of Conquest: Wales, 1063-1415, 2001, Oxford University Press, page 70 By the 13th century, Wiston Castle seems to have been abandoned and the Wogan family lived at Picton Castle, where their heirs have lived ever since. Picton Castle began as a motte castle and was reconstructed in stone by the Sir John Wogan between 1295 and 1308. The design was unusual, there being no courtyard internally, the main building being protected by seven circular towers which projected from the wall. At the east end, two of these towers acted as a gatehouse, and the portcullised-entrance between them led straight into the lower part of the great hall. At this time the windows were narrow slits but these were replaced in about 1400 by large windows and a grand recessed arch with large window was built in the gatehouse. In 1405, French troops supporting Owain Glynd≈µr attacked and held the Castle, and it was seized again during the English Civil War in 1645 by Parliamentary forces. Picton castle interior In the 15th century, the male-line of Wogans died out. Their heiress, Katherine, married Owen Dunn (). Sir Henry Dunn (), the grandson of Owen and Katherine, only had daughters. The Picton Castle estate thus came into the hands of the Philipps family when Sir Henry's daughter Jane married Sir Thomas ap Philipps of Cilsant in the 1490s. Sir John Philipps, who inherited the castle in the 15th century, remodelled the building and created a new entrance which remained until the 1820s when a new entrance was designed by Thomas Rowlands (who also designed Slebech Church). In 1611, King James I wanted to pay for his army in Ireland and decided to raise the money by selling baronetcies. Sir John Philipps paid ¬£1,095 for his hereditary title. 19th century engraving of Picton Castle The estate remained with the Philipps family until the death of Lord Milford in 1823, when it was inherited by his cousin Richard Grant, who assumed the surname Philipps and was created a Baronet in 1828 and Baron Milford in 1847. His heir was his half-brother, the Reverend James Henry Alexander Philipps (formerly Gwyther), who assumed by royal licence the surname and arms of Philipps. On his death the estate passed to his son-in-law, Charles Edward Gregg Philipps, who was created a Baronet, of Picton, in 1887 (see Philipps baronets) then to Sir Richard Foley Foley- Philipps, cousin of Sir John Erasmus, and grandson of Charles Edward Gregg Philipps. The estate is now run by the Picton Castle Trust, a Registered Charity. The castle is a Grade I listed building and the walled garden is listed at Grade II. Visitor attractions Picton Castle is open to visitors for guided tours from spring to autumn and the gardens are open all year round. They extend to about 40 acres and include a walled garden and a Mediterranean garden created in about 1800. There is a restaurant and shop and self-catering accommodation is available in the gatehouse lodges. Events such as exhibitions, fairs and workshops are held periodically and the venue is available for weddings.

Pantheon Books) Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do is a 1974 nonfiction book by the oral historian and radio broadcaster Studs Terkel. Working investigates the meaning of work for different people under different circumstances, showing it can vary in importance. The book also reflects Terkel's general idea that work can be difficult but still provides meaning for workers. It is an exploration of what makes work meaningful for people in all walks of life, from Lovin' Al the parking valet, Dolores the waitress, the fireman, to the business executive. The narrative moves through mundane details, emotional truths, and existential questioning. Structure Following a preface, a foreword, and an introduction, the volume is divided into nine \\"books,\\" each of which contains one or more subsections that provide several accounts of working people's jobs and lives. These books tie their diverse content together with themes. These themes take the form of subtitles. Some books have only one theme (the theme of Book One is \\"Working the Land\\"); others have several. =Book One= Book One contains stories by three newspaper delivery boys, a farmer, a farm worker, a farm woman, a deep miner and his wife, a strip miner, and a heavy equipment operator. Here is a sample: :\\"Working in the fields is not in itself a degrading job. It's hard, but if you're given regular hours, better pay, decent housing, unemployment and medical compensation, pension plans--we have a very relaxed way of living. But the growers don't recognize us as persons. That's the worst thing, the way they treat you. Like we have no brains. They have only a wallet in their head. The more you squeeze it, the more they cry out.\\" (Roberto Acuna, farm worker) =Book Two= Book Two features narratives from a receptionist, a hotel switchboard operator, a telephone operator, a professor of communications, an airline stewardess, an airline reservationist, a model, an executive secretary, a sex worker, a writer/producer, a copy chief, two actors, a press agent, an installment dealer, and a telephone solicitor. Here is a sample: :\\"I never listen in on a phone conversation, but I'll tell you what. I worked for Illinois Bell, and I don't care who the operator is, the greatest thing is listening on phone calls. [Laughs] When you're not busy. At the motel, no. At Bell, I did. If you work nights and it's real quiet, I don't think there's an operator who hasn't listened in on calls. The night goes faster.\\" (Frances Swenson, hotel switchboard operator) =Book Three= Book Three has stories by a sanitation truck driver, a garbage man, a washroom attendant, a factory mechanic, a domestic worker, a janitor, a doorman, two policemen, an industrial investigator, a photographer, and a film critic. Here is a sample: :\\"I worked in a white area on the West Side-- briefly. Being black, in plain clothes, people might mistake me for a burglar and shoot me. It's better for me to be in a black area. Of course, people couldn't mistake me there. [Laughs] Very few black officers work in white areas. They have a few, so they can say; 'No longer are we segregated.'\\" (Renault Robinson, policeman) =Book Four= Book Four tells the stories of two spot-welders, a utility man, a stock chaser, a plant manager, a general foreman, a local union president, two cabdrivers, a bus driver, an interstate truckdriver, a car hiker, and a car salesman. Here is a sample: :\\"I stand in the same spot, about two- or three-feet area, all night. The only time a person stops is when the line stops. We do about thirty-two jobs per car, per unit. Forty-eight units an hour, eight hours a day. Thirty-two times forty- eight times eight. Figure it out. That's how many times I push the button.\\" (Phil Stallings, spot-welder) =Book Five= Book Five narrates the tales of a barber, a hair stylist, a saleswoman, a dentist, a hotel clerk, a bar pianist, an elevator starter, an ex-salesman, a bank teller, an auditor, an organizer, an order filler in a shoe factory, a mail carrier, a gas meter reader, a supermarket box boy, a supermarket checker, a skycap, a felter in a luggage factory, a waitress, and two housewives. Here is a sample: :\\"You have to be terribly subservient to people. 'Ma'am, can I take your bag?' 'Can I do this?' It was a time when the grape strikers were passing out leaflets. They were very respectful. People'd come into the check stand, they'd say, 'I just bought grapes for the first time because of those idiots outside.' I had to put their grapes in the bag and thank them for coming and take them outside to the car. Being subservient made me very resentful.\\" (Brett Hauser, supermarket box boy) =Book Six= Book Six contains the stories of a bookbinder, a pharmacist, a piano tuner, a realty broker, a yacht broker, two stockbrokers, a project coordinator, a government relations coordinator, a process clerk, and an organizer. Here is a sample: :\\"I only enjoy working on books that say something. I know this is an anathema to people who insist on preserving books that are only going to be on the shelves forever--or on coffee tables. Books are for people to read, and that's that. I think books are for the birds unless people read them.\\" (Donna Murray, bookbinder) =Book Seven= Book Seven's narratives involve those of a jockey, a baseball player, a sports press agent, a tennis player, a hockey player, a football coach, a radio executive, a factory owner, a bank audit department head, an ex-boss, the ex- boss' daughter, an ex-president of a conglomerate/consultant, \\"Ma and Pa Courage,\\" and three retirees. Here is a sample: :\\"To be a jockey you must love the horse. There's a lot of times when I lose my patience with him. There's just certain horses that annoy you. There's no two alike. They have personalities just like you and I do.\\" (Eddie Arroyo, jockey) =Book Eight= Book Eight's stories are about a copy boy, a publisher, a proofreader, a department store manager, a jazz musician, an executive, the director of a bakery cooperative, a hospital aide, a baby nurse, a public school teacher, an alternative school teacher, an occupational therapist, a patient's representative, a practical nurse in an old people's home, a memorial counselor, and a grave digger. Here is a sample: :\\"I usually wear myself some black sunglasses. I never go to a funeral without sunglasses. It's a good idea because your eyes is the first thing that shows when you have a big emotion. Always these black sunglasses.\\" (Elmer Ruiz, gravedigger) =Book Nine= Book Nine recounts the narratives of a tree nursery attendant, a carpenter/poet, an editor, an industrial designer, a nun to naprapath, an ex-salesman/ farmer, a lawyer, a librarian, a stone cutter, a service station owner, the service station's son and partner, a steelworker, the steelworker's son (a priest), an adult education teacher, a freight elevator operator, a policeman, and a fireman. Here is a sample: :\\"You recognize yourself as a marginal person. As a person who can give only minimal assent to anything that is going on in this society: 'I'm glad the electricity works.' That's about it. What you have to find is your own niche that will allow you to keep feeding and clothing and sheltering yourself without getting downtown. [Laughs] Because that's death. That's really where death is.\\" (Nora Watson, editor) Famous names Among the many who speak their minds about their work and their lives are baseball player Steve Hamilton (\\"To be perfectly honest with you, I'm ready to quit\\"), actor Rip Torn (\\"I don't have any contempt for people who do commercials\\") and football coach George Allen (\\"You have to put a priority on everything you do each day\\"). General themes As the foreword to the book points out, \\"Mr. Terkel found, work was a search, sometimes successful, sometimes not, 'for daily meaning as well as daily bread'.... The oral histories in Working are wistful dispatches from a distant era...when management practices and computers were just beginning to transform the American workplace. In the last thirty years, productivity has soared but job satisfaction has plummeted. It is hard to read Working without wondering what has gone wrong.\\" Spinoffs and adaptations A bestseller when first published in 1974, the book also inspired the Broadway musical of the same title, and a similar book edited thirty years later by a team (mainly John Bowe, Marisa Bowe and Sabin Streeter), Gig: Americans Talk About Their Jobs. In May 2009 Harvey Pekar's graphic novel adaptation was released by The New Press, edited by Paul Buhle, with art by Sharon Rudahl, Terry LaBan, Gary Dumm, Peter Gullerud, Pablo G. Callejo, et al. References in popular culture In July 2009, The Second City ETC opened their 33rd revue, Studs Terkel's Not Working, honoring the writer in the year following his death. The revue, like Terkel's book, focused on the lives of ordinary people. Singer/songwriter James Taylor wrote a song called \\"Millworker\\" which was released on his 1979 album Flag. On his 2002 DVD Pull Over, Taylor explains that a story about a woman in a shoe manufacturing plant in Massachusetts, described in the book, inspired the song. In the television series The Facts of Life, Working is one of the books parents wanted to ban in the episode \\"Read No Evil\\". On Sept. 5, 2019, podcast The Radio Diaries, produced by Radiotopia on PRX, released an episode called \\"The Working Tapes of Studs Terkel.\\" In it, Terkel's taped interviews with working people are played and examined.

A prominent businessman, and two time mayor of St Kilda, Hughes was also part-time Militia officer, and had served in the artillery forces of the Victorian colonial forces prior to federation. Post federation, Hughes had risen to command several light horse brigades before volunteering for service with the Australian Imperial Force in October 1914. Appointed to command the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, he subsequently led the formation to Egypt and then Gallipoli. During the Battle of the Nek his brigade suffered heavy casualties and he was later evacuated from the peninsula in September 1915, suffering with typhoid. He continued to suffer ill health, but returned to active service mid-1918, undertaking a staff role until 1920 when he retired as a major general. Post war, he returned to civilian business and died in St Kilda at the age of 86. Early life and career Frederic Godfrey Hughes was born on 26 January 1858 in the Melbourne suburb of Windsor, the son of a grazier, Charles Hughes and his wife Ellen. He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School. As a youth, Hughes was a talented player of Australian rules football; he was also an accomplished athlete and rower, according to biographer Judy Smart. He played for St Kilda for three seasons beginning in 1876, and then transferred to Essendon in 1879. The Footballer magazine described him as \\"a most useful man, plays very hard and with remarkable judgment, follows splendidly, a fine kick, and unerring mark\\". After leaving school, Hughes undertook clerical work, and was employed by a land valuer until he started his own business in this field in 1884. In 1898, he became a St Kilda City Councillor, serving for years including two periods as mayor (1901 to 1902 and 1911 to 1912). During this time, he held directorships with several companies, including Dunlop Rubber and South Broken Hill. Military career In 1875, Hughes joined the part-time military forces ‚Äì the Militia ‚Äì being assigned as a gunner to the St Kilda Artillery Battery. After eight years, he had reached the rank of sergeant, before being commissioned as an officer in 1885. He assumed command of the Victorian Nordenfeldt Battery in mid-1888 with the rank of captain, and continued in the role after it became part of the Victorian Horse Artillery the following year, commanding the Rupertswood Battery. He received his majority in 1891 and then served in the field artillery from 1897 until undertaking a staff role in Melbourne after. In 1901, he was achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and assumed command of the 11th Light Horse Regiment in 1903. He was promoted to colonel in 1906, and placed in command of the 4th Light Horse Brigade. In 1909, Hughes took up an appointment the Governor-General's aide de camp. In 1912, the 4th Light Horse Brigade was re-designated as the 7th Light Horse Brigade. =First World War= Following the outbreak of the First World War, Hughes volunteered for overseas service and was appointed Australian Imperial Force as a colonel on 17 October 1914. At this time, he assumed command of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade; he was assigned Lieutenant Colonel John Antill, a regular officer, as his brigade major. Hughes came to depend heavily upon Antill, although the latter was described as \\"well respected, if prickly\\". Hughes' brigade departed for Egypt in February and March 1915 where it continued training. In May, the light horse formations were dispatched to Gallipoli as reinforcements, serving in a dismounted role. The brigade arrived at Anzac Cove on 20 May 1915, and was assigned as corps troops to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. There were concerns about Hughes' age, and the corps commander, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, had \\"grave doubts about Hughes' capacity\\". Initially, Hughes held the rank of full colonel, but in July was promoted to brigadier general as all Australian brigade commanders were regraded to achieve parity with the British Army. Hughes' brigade undertook defensive duties initially, holding an area around Walker's Ridge and Russell's Top. In an effort to break the deadlock they were committed to the August Offensive. Major General Alexander Godley, in command of the offensive, ordered Hughes to launch a dawn attack the Turkish positions at the Nek on 7 August 1915 with a bayonet charge as a diversion to support the attack on Chunuk Bair. From the outset the effort went awry. Efforts to destroy the machine guns enfilading the attack failed, and the supporting artillery barrage stopped seven minutes early due to a failure to synchronise watches, which allowed the defenders were able to reoccupy their firing positions before the attack. In the desperate battle that followed, four waves of light horsemen charged the Turkish trenches, only to be cut down by unsuppressed fire from at least 30 machine guns. According to military historian Ross Mallett, \\"Hughes mismanaged the battle\\" and while the wider issues that led to its failure were not of his making, his decisions ultimately exacerbated the heavy casualties his brigade suffered. During the battle, Hughes \\"left his headquarters around the time the second wave of 150 had attacked in order to try to observe the attack, thereby isolating himself from Antill and the rest of his headquarters\\". Antill subsequently refused a request from the commander of the 10th Light Horse Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Noel Brazier, to cancel the third wave, which was also decimated. Part of the fourth wave also went over the top, before Brazier and some officers from the 8th Light Horse Regiment reached Hughes in time to call off any further waves. Out of around 500 men committed to the attack, more than half became casualties, with 234 being killed and 138 wounded. Most of those that were killed, died within only a few metres of the Australian trench line. In the aftermath of the attack, Hughes' brigade took part in another attack, this time around Hill 60 in late August. After this, the brigade's regiments returned to defensive duties. Hughes' health subsequently deteriorated and on 20 September he was evacuated, suffering from typhoid. Command of the brigade then passed to Antill. In March 1916, Hughes embarked for Australia, due to ongoing health issues. Nevertheless, he was able to rejoin the AIF with the rank of brigadier general in July 1918, taking up an appointment with the Sea Transport Service. He retired in March 1920 with the rank of major general. Post-war Hughes returned to civilian business in his later years. In retirement he focused on gardening. He died in St Kilda on 23 August 1944 at age 86. His wife, Eva, predeceased him; having married in 1885, the couple had four children. A funeral service was held at All Saints Church, St Kilda, and he was buried with military honours. His decorations included a Companion of the Order of the Bath and the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration. He was also mentioned in despatches.

Biography  Murray studied at Butler University and the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, before private study with Marcel Dupr√© in Paris. (He was the last important student of Dupr√©, of whom he would later write a biography.) During the 1968‚Äì69 performance season, Murray performed the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach in a series of twelve recitals in Cleveland. He later commemorated the 150th birthday of C√©sar Franck by playing that composer's complete organ works in 1972. He repeated the cycle for the hundredth anniversary of Franck's death (1990, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City.) Murray's performances have included nearly every major city in North America, with numerous appearances as a soloist with major orchestras. Critics hailed Murray's rare combination of technique, thoughtfulness, and musical feeling. He has made many recordings on the Telarc label, featuring the works of Bach, Franck, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns and others. Murray is now retired from concert performing and recording. He also retired in June, 2014, from St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Columbus, Ohio, where he was organist for 31 years. He was named organist emeritus. He is also a librarian in the Music and Dance Library at The Ohio State University. Murray has written many articles and has published five books. His Marcel Dupr√©: The Work of a Master Organist (Northeastern University Press, ) is in its third printing. He has also written French Masters of the Organ (Yale University Press, ) and served as editor for A Jacques Barzun Reader (HarperCollins, ). He has written a biography of Jacques Barzun, Jacques Barzun: Portrait of a Mind (Frederic C. Beil, ). Murray has been awarded an honorary doctorate by The Ohio State University (2000).

Kjell saw more than 32 years of service, the first 28 years in the Royal Norwegian Navy during the First World War and in the interwar period, the last four in the Kriegsmarine, having been captured in the first days of the 1940 Norwegian Campaign. After being rebuilt as a minesweeper by the Germans, she was sunk by Royal Air Force de Havilland Mosquito fighter bombers on 28 September 1944. Divers rediscovered the shipwreck in 2006. Characteristics Kjell was the last of 27 small, cigar shaped pre-First World War torpedo boats built for the Royal Norwegian Navy.Thomassen 1995: 138 The other ships in her post-1905 series were the 1906 Teist (black guillemot) and the 1907 Skarv (cormorant). The series' main armament consisted of two deck-mounted torpedo launchers and one fixed torpedo tube in the bow. While Teist and Skarv were both armed with two 47 mm guns, Kjell was equipped with a single 76 mm main gun.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 22 Unlike all the preceding Norwegian torpedo boats the Officers' Mess on board Kjell was located in the bow section, with easy access to the command position in the tower.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 48 First World War The Royal Norwegian Navy mobilized on 2 August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. With Norway having declared herself a neutral country the torpedo boats were ordered to carry the lion's share of the neutrality protection patrols. This was despite their less than satisfactory seaworthiness in open seas, having been designed for service close to shore and in the many Norwegian fjords. The background for the decision to deploy the torpedo boats as the main Norwegian patrol force was based on the small ships being more economic to operate than the navy's larger vessels in a time of uncertain coal and oil supplies.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 37 In one episode during her First World War service Kjell intercepted the British submarine on 2 July 1916.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 40 The submarine had hailed and fired two shots at the 578 ton Norwegian steamer SS Prunelle of Bergen, off Lindesnes in southern Norway. The British submarine managed to dive and make good its escape, but although E30s crew claimed that Prunelle was from shore and hence outside Norwegian territorial waters, the Norwegians claimed that the steamer was only from shore and therefore inside Norwegian waters. The Norwegians therefore protested that the attack had violated Norwegian territorial waters and that E30 had dived away and not remained on the surface. The neutrality violation had been so well documented that the UK government later issued an apology to its Norwegian counterpart, and revised its instruction to submarines operating close to neutral coastlines. The islet-rich F√¶rder area in 1915 Inter-war period By the end of the First World War the Norwegian torpedo boat fleet had been worn down by constant service and 14 of the vessels were decommissioned and disposed of in 1920. Twenty-three torpedo boats, including Kjell, were obliged to continue in service due to budgetary restrictions despite being long outdated and ready for replacement.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 47 Although officially still in service the torpedo boats spent most of the inter-war period in port, only being equipped for exercises some two to three months every year.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 49 =Intercepting smugglers= For Kjell the 1922 exercise season turned out somewhat unusual as she was deployed against alcohol smugglers on the coast as part of the enforcement of the 1916‚Äì1927 Norwegian prohibition. During 20 days in September 1922 Kjell operated off F√¶rder in Tj√∏me, soon earning the nickname Terror of the smugglers (Norw. Smugglernes skrekk) by confiscating on average of spirits a day. At the conclusion of the 20-day anti-smuggling cruise each member of the torpedo boat's crew received the then-substantial amount of 382 Norwegian kroner in prize money. Second World War =Norwegian service= Neutrality protection At the outbreak of the Second World War the Norwegian torpedo boat force was again deployed guarding the coastline against neutrality violations. Kjell was at that time part of the 2. Torpedo boat Division in the Kristiansand section of the 1st Naval District, covering the southernmost part of the Norwegian coastline. As had been the case during the First World War the torpedo boats were once more spread singly along the coastline.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 50 =Rescuing a Norwegian aircrew= One incident in which Kjell was involved was when she on 14 October 1939 rescued from the skerry √òstre Flandern near Flekker√∏y the three-man crew of Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 F.320, which had made an emergency landing after suffering engine failure. Kjell recovered the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service crew in the early afternoon of 14 October, while the wreck of F.320 was retrieved by the patrol boat Lyngdal the next day.Hafsten 2003: 127 =Altmark Incident= German dead being brought ashore for burial after the Altmark Incident One of the tasks given to the Norwegian torpedo boat force as part of their renewed neutrality protection duties was the escort and inspection of vessels belonging to the warring parties. One of these missions included the control and escort of the German auxiliary tanker Altmark in February 1940. Altmark was returning to Germany after having supported the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in the South Atlantic. On her return voyage to Germany she was carrying 299 British merchant sailors as prisoners of war, and entered Norwegian waters north of Trondheimsfjord on 14 February 1940. The transport of POWs through neutral territorial waters was not in violation of public international law, and as Norwegian authorities feared an incident between the German ship and the Royal Navy the ship was allowed passage through the restricted areas at Bergen. The passage at Bergen was in violation of official Norwegian neutrality regulations as the tanker was a state-operated vessel of a warring party.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 51 As Altmark proceeded southwards to Germany she was escorted along the way by various Norwegian warships. On the day after she entered Norwegian waters, 15 February, the Altmark was spotted by British reconnaissance aircraft and soon after confronted by a force of six Royal Navy destroyers. In an effort to avoid capture Altmark sought shelter in the J√∏ssingfjord, in the area between Egersund and Flekkefjord, now under the escort of Kjell and fellow torpedo boat Skarv. Ignoring protests from the Norwegian naval vessels, which commanders were under direct orders not to fire at the British, the destroyer HMS Cossack entered J√∏ssingfjord at 2220hrs on 16 February and boarded the German ship, killing six, mortally wounding one of the German crew and freeing the British prisoners. The failure of Kjell and the other Norwegian warships to intervene in the blatant neutrality violation led Hitler to speed up plans for a German invasion of Norway, six days after the incident appointing General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst as commander of the operation. One of the immediate German reactions to the incident was a demand that the commanders of Kjell and Skarv be dismissed, although this was quickly dropped following the recommendation of the German legation in Oslo. The Norwegian government on its part issued strong protests to the UK government, President of the Norwegian Parliament C. J. Hambro stating that the united Norwegian parliament and people protested the British intrusion at J√∏ssingfjord. =U-21= Another incident occurred the following month when, on 27 March 1940, the accidentally ran aground at Oddene near Ryvingen south-east of Mandal. Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 F.328 landed near the U-boat and guarded it until Norwegian naval vessels reached the scene and interned the crew. U-21 was towed to Kristiansand the next day under escort of Kjell, Teist, the destroyer and the B class submarine .Hafsten 2003: 128 German invasion On 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion, Kjell was in Kristiansand carrying out repairs which were finished by afternoon. The next morning she was ordered to nearby Marvika naval base to take on board torpedoes. However, before the vessel could be made war ready orders came through from the commander of the local naval section that resistance to the German invasion in the Kristiansand area was to cease. As the Germans occupied Marvika Kjell was allowed to move to nearby Vigebukta bay in the Topdalsfjord. On 11 April the torpedo boat was seized by German infantry and at 1830hrs the German war flag was raised, signalling the ship's transfer to Kriegsmarine service. =German service= Initially renamed KT1 and used as a Vorpostenboot (outpost boat), she was then rebuilt as a minesweeper under the name NK.02 Dragoner. Serving as a patrol boat and escort vessel on the coast of occupied Norway, Dragoner was sailing alone off Ryvingen near Mandal when she was discovered and attacked by six No. 248 Squadron RAF de Havilland Mosquito fighter bombers on 28 September 1944. After a brief and futile fight she was sunk by a combination of autocannon fire and a depth charge exploding underneath her midship section. Of the 25 Germans on board at the time of the sinking 18 survived, seven of whom were wounded. The attacking RAF aircraft suffered no damage from the German return-fire and all returned to base.Hafsten 1991: 196 Discovery of the wreck The wreck of Dragoner was discovered partly intact at some depth several kilometres from land by a team of three Norwegian divers in February 2006. The wreck has since been declared a war grave.

Early life John Osborn Williams, owner of the Labrador Development Company Ltd [facing camera] and Arthur Eric Williams his eldest son.The Port Hope Simpson Challenge Llewelyn Pritchard Amazon 2012 Williams was born at 46 George Street, Cardiff, Wales, his parents' home, and was the youngest son of Silas and Mary Williams. He was one of eight children and known as \\"Jack\\" within the family. He left school at age 14 in 1900 and entered the timber exporting business. \\"Jayo\\" as he was usually known, like two of his brothers Hiram and Arthur, became a commercial clerk at the age of fifteen.Tombstone: [Vol 5a] Llewelyn Pritchard Amazon 2013 p. 14 The family's heavy industrial and clerical occupational experience was the background for at least two other logging, trading, and shipping agency companies he was to set up. In 1908, at 22 years of age, he moved to work for Evans and Reed, Cardiff coal exporters and importers of pit props. In 1914 during the First World War, he worked in the Baltic area, and in August of that year, he went to Montreal, spending September to December 1914 in Dominion of Newfoundland. From the end of the war, he sought to develop his business interests on the island. In 1921, he obtained ¬£10,000 backing from Franklin Thomas and Company, Cardiff coal importer, to help him set up J. O. Williams Company in 1925. However, the liquidation of the British and North American Trading Company in which Williams had shares bankrupted him.Pritchard L. Port Hope Simpson Off the Beaten Path Amazon 2011 p.46 Development of the Labrador area Before the company arrived at the present day site of Port Hope Simpson, certain events had taken place. It was on board the S.S. Sylvia en route to St. John's, Newfoundland from City of Halifax, Nova Scotia that Williams first discussed his ambitions for the Labrador with Sir John Hope Simpson, Commissioner of Natural Resources and Acting Commissioner of Justice 1934‚Äì36, and Thomas Lodge, Commissioner of Public Utilities from 1934‚Äì1937. He won them over with his enthusiasm, optimism and experience and convinced them he was just the sort of entrepreneurial man they were looking for. For their part, they could not believe their good luck in having met him. They viewed Williams as somebody who could help them make an impact in their new posts. Lodge described Williams to The Dominions Office in London as 1/3 visionary, 1/3 speculator and 1/3 businessman.Pritchard L. Port Hope Simpson Clues Amazon 2011 p.23 However, time would tell that Simpson and Lodge had made a grave error of judgment about entering into a business relationship with Williams. In June 1934 the first party of managerial and administrative staff landed at the site on the Alexis River. Williams had hired 520 men; southern Inuit men from nearby communities and unemployed men from the island of Newfoundland who came on government passes to work. He showed that some sort of permanent employment in addition to the cod fishery was possible in the area, and even though he brought south Labrador Inuit and Newfoundlanders together, most Newfoundlanders did not stay for more than two or three years. However, because of southern Inuit families moving into the area to participate in the new economic projects, it was reported that there were almost 70 families in Port Hope Simpson in 1934. Within one month, however, by 26 July 1934, 225 lumbermen of the Labrador Development Company returned to St John's because they were dissatisfied with their working conditions.Port Hope Simpson Clues, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada [Kindle Edition] Llewelyn Pritchard Amazon p.4 Although the men were keen to work they found poor accommodation and little food. The company controlled everyone through the very strict manager and because Williams prohibited any buying and selling outside his store.Port Hope Simpson Off The Beaten Path Llewelyn Pritchard Amazon p. 135 (Although one enterprising local did bring a boatload of goods upriver to Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador, moored offshore and proceeded to do a brisk trade before he was stopped.) Workers were paid from $1.75 to $2.00 per cord (48 to 55-cent/m¬≥) of pit-props, using a bucksaw for 12 hours per day. They were put on rations of mostly beans and porridge and bought deteriorating food from the company store. Men had to go out hunting to obtain sufficient food for themselves and their families. Many of the non-Inuit, not accustomed to the way of life came with dreams of prosperity but soon realised that conditions were the same as the fishery. They were always in debt! Eventually forcing most of them to move back to Newfoundland. By 30 July 1934 Police Superintendent O'Neil had investigated the complaints of the 225 lumbermen and declared that there were no valid grounds for the strike although it was admitted that the preparations for the 500 men were inadequate when they arrived. In August 1934 the first permanent settlement started at the site of a logging camp run by the Labrador Development Company and named after Sir John Hope Simpson. The first Company Town in Labrador had been born and large scale commercial development of the woods around Alexis and Lewis Bays for the export of pit props to south Wales had begun. Building development at Port Hope Simpson, by the winter of 1935, only consisted of a community hall and a hospital or seven-room medical clinic. A general store, a hall ‚Äì also used as a church and a school ‚Äì had also been erected at adjacent Mill Point cove. But as early as November 1934, after Sir John Hope Simpson, who had agreed to Williams's suggestion that the settlement be named after himself, opening-up Simpson to accusations of favouritism, had returned to England over Christmas to meet with officials at the Dominions Office, it had become apparent that J. O. Williams had lost his government's support. When the Dominions Office found out that the 400 houses were not being built at Port Hope Simpson and money had effectively been borrowed under false pretences on Simpson's say‚Äìso it brought about a complete change in their attitude towards Simpson and Williams. Simpson was recalled to the Dominions Office in November 1934 not on the pretence of some constitutional issue or other but to face severe reprimand for what he and Lodge had allowed to happen. He had failed spectacularly to get Williams to toe the line in repaying his debts because he feared that Williams would carry out his threat to pull out of Labrador and Newfoundland altogether. Williams, on the other hand, made no fundamental misjudgement about his economic prospects on the Labrador, because, by using borrowed government funds he proceeded to make money hand over fist from 1934‚Äì1940. By the time the Public Enquiry was held into Williams' affairs in 1945 his personal qualities of drive and persistence had become more than a thorough nuisance, as the Dominions Office had failed to get to the bottom of what he was up to. They were aware they had been hoodwinked and John Chadwick, one of the civil servants, believed he had seen a way out of the mess via a proposed public enquiry that would enable the government to cut all ties with Williams once and for all despite the blunders of their representative, Sir John Hope Simpson. By 29 January 1935 it was clear that the Labrador Development Company was taking maximum advantage of the fact that exploitation of the woods could happen in an unregulated way. This state of affairs carried on from 1935 to 1940. It wasn't until after a government director was appointed to its board from 1940 and the Public Enquiry into its affairs took place in 1944 that Williams's activities were finally controlled. On 4 June 1935 in a very confidential letter marked \\"secret and personal\\", Sir John Hope Simpson wrote that 200 families were being settled at the Alexis River site. Less than two weeks after Simpson wrote the above letter, the Commission of Government had supposedly taken over complete financial control of all properties in both of Williams' companies. That Simpson had moved so quickly in making such preparations is in direct contrast to the previously supportive way in which he had dealt with the company. In a letter on 5 July 1935 to Bridges, Clutterbuck at the Dominions Office wrote that plans were in sight for a permanent settlement. Two weeks later, Simpson wrote that the loggers were earning great wages of about $3.00 per day. In fact they were only earning at the very most about $1.30 per day. By September of that year, Simpson revealed he was looking for excuses to leave the scene in Newfoundland altogether. By the end of 1936 in Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Company had arranged for the men to build themselves about 60 small houses for rent but most Labradorians chose not to live in the company housing due to their rental costs, living instead about a quarter of a mile away on the opposite side of Black Water brook. In justification of the good works done by Williams, his counsel at the public enquiry in 1945 emphasised that the company had rendered every possible service at considerable cost to provide work for the people of Newfoundland and the needy families of Labrador. By so doing it was claimed it had adhered to the agreement made with the Commission of Government on 30 April 1934 that the government wished to do everything it could to help develop the Labrador and the company. Williams' counsel claimed that after years of work; the company had stabilised and had built up an efficient unit of workers who took an interest in their work and their employers. By March 1938 Williams felt that government policy towards him had steadily deteriorated and by the time of the public enquiry in 1945 he was fighting a long lost cause. Disaffection with the Labrador Development Company representatives on site quickly set in whilst J O Williams was 3,000 miles away in Britain living in luxury in Cardiff city centre next door to Eric by 15 March 1938. In a context of suspicious and acrimonious circumstances from his loggers and their families towards The Company, in the early hours of 3 February 1940, personal tragedy hit Williams as Eric Arthur Williams, his eldest son and Erica D'Anitoff Williams his infant daughter seemed to have died in a house fire in Port Hope Simpson. The cause of their deaths is yet to be established and foul play cannot be ruled out as part of the ongoing Royal Canadian Mounted Police R.C.M.P. Serious Crimes Unit Investigation opened in August 2002. The date not only marked the first time the case had been moved from The Department of Natural Resources to the Department of Justice in Canada but also marked the first time, albeit 62 years later, that an investigation into the circumstances around the deaths took place which found that somebody may well have been \\"stirring the pot\\" as the people felt betrayed by Williams. Eric had been sent out by his Father into a most difficult situation (where the loggers and their families had been kept in the dark about what had been going-on behind the scenes) to report on the issue of unauthorised stores having been bought for the Company Store (monopoly) operation in Port Hope Simpson. Eric ordered that excess stores be returned to St. John's and went beyond his Father's instructions by entering into the Keith Younge local contract for cutting pit props to be shipped out to South Wales although at the time this arrangement was seen as a good way of helping the Company to continue its operation in the area. But it was not to be...as Eric and his daughter were quite likely unlawfully killed. According to the original correspondence within the Public Enquiry, Keith Younge, local Labrador Development Company Limited store manager ordered that the two bodies should be quickly buried and a concrete headstone inscribed and erected. Subsequently, a granite memorial stone as first seen in 1969 cut from the Preseli Hills of South Wales and shipped out by Williams replaced the smaller headstone and significantly, all mention of Olga D'Anitoff Williams, Eric's wife, by order of J O Williams from back in South Wales, was removed from the final epitaph. The Public Enquiry into the Financial Affairs of The Labrador Development Limited (kept in UK National Archives) clearly shows within its original correspondence that J O Williams considered Olga to be of a \\"bad character.\\" Williams' confidential letter to Keith Yonge in 1941 in which he admitted that he had the money but wanted to get as big a concession from the government as possible before disclosing his financial strength also indicates his level of deception. It was only after Williams and the Labrador Development Company had left Port Hope Simpson in 1948 that the people could set about bettering themselves, but by this time many had moved away in search of work. The Public Enquiry was held in St. John's, Newfoundland and reported in 1945 into the affairs of the Labrador Development Company Limited. It was engineered by a group of six civil servants at the Dominions Office who wanted to show that Williams was of unreliable character.The Port Hope Simpson Challenge The plot thickens!!! Amazon p. 21 When Chief Justice Dunfield's report on the public enquiry came out it meant the Dominions Office's plan to discredit Williams' character had seriously backfired. The government wanted the report buried after local publication. :\\"On the whole, I should imagine that the Commission will be content to bury the main bodies of both reports as deeply as their publication locally permits.\\" ‚ÄîChadwick J. C., Dominions Office, London 29 June 1945 Judge Dunfield found that Williams had run out of liquid cash reserves that were essential to scale up the operations. He considered that the government was also responsible for the company and had pressed Williams to cut more timber to provide more work for the people. Dunfield knew that $19400 per annum of capital had to be re- paid to the government ($1.00 per cord (28-cent/m¬≥) on limited production) plus the heavy interest on the government loan and that it was initially planned to cut 50000 cords (180000 m¬≥) of timber per annum. Dunfield's conclusion was that neither Williams nor the government fully appreciated how much the Port Hope Simpson project would cost and so the company was under- funded right from the start. It found itself in a vicious circle where it did not have sufficient funds to expand and, without the expansion, its overheads could not be carried. Dunfield clearly implied that he was not exactly confident about the financial health of the company from the outset. His judgment was that the government went from being a supportive partner to being a strict creditor. Then the Second World War came and stopped the free export of pit props. The people from 1934‚Äì39 received according to Dunfield, not less than $800,000 in wages when they might have been on the dole. Dunfield acknowledged Williams' particular line of skill, but thought that he was not experienced in other fields and that he himself had admitted so. The $250,000 reinvestment Williams made in Labrador from his Newfoundland trade, coupled with the money from his Cardiff company hid the true position according to Dunfield, which was that the Labrador enterprise needed a much greater capital investment and a larger working capital than had been provided. Dunfield laid the blame firmly on Williams and said that the government was also to blame for failing to fulfil its partnership contribution in the circumstances. Dunfield thought the government lacked the right calibre of officials, with the right training to work successfully with Williams the business person. Dunfield went so far as to say in his final report that Williams should perhaps be given another chance. Dunfield was in fact quite sympathetic towards Williams and definite that he was not entirely to blame for what had happened. He knew that the Government had gained more than it had lost on the venture and he would not swallow the vitriolic anti-Williams propaganda. He had found no evidence to justify the bad impression that other people and he had held before the start of the enquiry about Williams. Dunfield might have over-reacted against the very suggestion that he should take part in any sort of rigged public enquiry to attack Williams' character and discredit him. Instead, he recommended that the Government and Williams should try again. In 1945 the population of Port Hope Simpson had been 352 which included 119 children. However, one year later from Williams's point of view, the situation had looked desperate, :\\"When I restarted at Hope Simpson in 1946 I was faced with a derelict township, everything that could be turned into cash was sold, or stolen, down to the office furniture....I have already spent over $20,000 putting the place right...The argument that we could not get the labour is absurd.\\" ‚ÄîJ. O. Williams, original correspondence 1945 Back in Britain on the one hand, the British treasury was trying to ensure that the UK taxpayer would not have to bear any loss incurred by the company if it went into liquidation. On the other hand, it also wanted to make absolutely certain the government were not going to be liable for any claim made by Williams for special compensation. Therefore, wanting to appear generous in public, within the modified terms of their final settlement, they offered to waive the interest on their loan from 30 June 1940 ‚Äì 20 November 1945. The export of timber from Labrador would be free of all tax from 1946‚Äì1955 inclusive and then subject to an export tax of 0.25 cents per cord (0.07-cent/m¬≥) from 1956‚Äì1966. Royalties on cutting were not payable and Williams was offered a fresh timber contract in 1946, which he accepted. The treasury had been consistent over the years in its unwillingness to allocate Williams any more money because of his unreliability. Nevertheless, Williams was still granted a further $100,000 loan on 15 October 1946 that included excellent terms by the British government for his last timber contract ‚Äì despite the fact that about half of the final contract of wood was left behind. :\\"...about the Labrador Development Company's contract with the Ministry of Supply to ship timbers to this country...Eales indicated that he expected production to be nearer the minimum figure of 8,000 fathoms than the maximum of 12,000; but it appears to have fallen much short of that. We seem to have been badly bamboozled.\\" ‚ÄîChadwick J. 20 January 1947 By the time the contract was completed Williams had definitely made up his mind not to continue with business in Newfoundland and Labrador any longer. Despite the very generous terms he was still claiming that the evidence entitled him to a fair settlement and he had been thinking about progressing into the fishing business in the area. He was very confident that the old Labrador crowd were ready to go back to work for him. However, in a press interview on 24 December 1945, he was quoted as saying that 165 men were logging at Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador but that 572 men who had been sent there in November had refused to work and had to be brought back and 20 more had demanded repatriation. Chadwick's view from the Dominions Office in the same year about the Labrador Development Company was that, \\"Our aim was to end this sordid history one way or the other rather than allow matters to drift on as they have done for the past five years.\\" ‚ÄîChadwick J. 1945 The original correspondence from the Public Enquiry shows Chadwick was very eager to cut his losses from the Dominions Office's long- running affair with Williams and in the end Williams did not make a claim for financial compensation against the British government. In a wider political context, Williams' efforts to keep alive the Labrador Development Company were going on when Newfoundland and Labrador were moving towards joining the Confederation of Canada in 1949. The obvious effect upon Williams was that he chose to close down his operations completely at Port Hope Simpson rather than pay federal taxes on the wood. The affairs of the Labrador Development Company at Port Hope Simpson 1934‚Äì1949 were hushed-up because it would not have been in the public and national interest to have done otherwise. In the lead up to the Second World War, a climate of trust was vital in our political leaders. The last thing the United Kingdom and its steadfast ally Newfoundland wanted was to be distracted from the war by a relatively trifling dispute about what was going on at Port Hope Simpson. Newfoundland had already suffered from a lack of available work and the low wages of the Great Depression. It needed work for its population like never before and The Labrador Development Company appeared to be offering just that. However, the effect of the political shenanigans of Sir John Hope Simpson, John Osborn Williams, the Commission of Government and the Dominions Office upon the brave crowd of southern Inuit and transient Newfoundlanders in Port Hope Simpson was to make it impossible for them to find out what was going on behind the scenes. Williams had borrowed the money from the Colonial Office's funds in London under false intentions. He subsequently failed to build the promised 400 houses for the loggers and their families and failed to pay them a reasonable living wage. They were held in poverty by the monopoly of the Company's store in the settlement as they were forced to live under its system of credit. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigating officer in 2003 about whether or not foul play had occurred in the early hours of 3 February 1940 stated that, \\"He...Williams...betrayed the people and no doubt this would have stirred the pot enough for someone to have taken drastic measures by their own hands and started the fire at the house that led to the deaths of Eric, J.O.'s eldest son and Erica his infant daughter.\\" ‚Äî21 October 2003 Thomas Lodge concluded that it had been the Secretary of State for Canada who had failed to give guidance to the commission who were a collection of individuals running their own departments. He described the commission as an experiment in dictatorship and claimed he left his post because he could no longer carry on working with people who completely failed to agree on a positive policy and because he could not convince the Secretary of State to adopt his own point of view. The Dominions Office removed Lodge from his position of commissioner early in 1937 and the publication of his book Dictatorship in Newfoundland in 1939 put him out of favour in London.Lodge T. Dictatorship in Newfoundland Cassell & Co. 1939 Nevertheless, he became a government director of the Labrador Development Company in 1940. Lodge would have been well-placed to have handled the two deaths.

By the 1930s, Regal was one of the largest manufacturers in the world. Since its inception, the Regal name has been used in a wide range of resonator instruments, such as guitars, mandolins and ukuleles. Nowadays Regal is property Saga Musical Instruments, with its instruments manufactured in Korea and distributed in San Francisco, United States. Currently, only resonator guitars are sold under the Regal brand. All are manufactured in Korea and then distributed in the United States.  History  Emil Wulschner, a retailer of Indianapolis, opened his first music instruments factory ‚Äì\\"Emil Wulschner & Son\\" in 1896 to build guitars and mandolins. Products were sold under three brand names: Regal, University and 20th. Century. Wulschner died in 1900, and the new owners renamed the company the \\"Regal Musical instrument Manufacturing Company\\" in 1901 and continued using the Regal name on instruments through 1904. Regal resonator guitar In 1904, Lyon & Healy purchased rights to the brand Regal. Four years later, the company officially re-introduced the Regal name in Chicago, establishing their factory there. Lyon & Healy set Regal up as an independent company in 1924. During its first years of existence, Regal only marketed 4-string instruments such as ukuleles and tenor guitars. The production of 6-string guitars would began later. The Regal brand was heavily involved in the production of resonator fretted instruments from their first development until 1941, manufacturing components and bodies for both the National and the Dobro companies which they acquired in 1934, though the Dopyera brothers still produced the resonator cones for them. The bodies of their laminated bellied guitars were particularly suited to resonator conversion.Regal Musical Instrument Co. on Lardy's Ukulele Database Regal made a line of mandolins for Perlberg & Halpin of New York to brand Blue Comet In the early 1930s, Regal had licensed the use of Dobro resonators. When National moved from California to Chicago, Regal acquired the rights to manufacture Dobro instruments. That made Regal be another producer of \\"house brand\\" guitars before World War II. Production of resonator guitars ceased in 1941, and of all fretted instruments in 1954. That same year, Regal close down as a company, and its rights to the name and assets were sold to the Harmony Company. Harmony owned Regal for a brief period so Fender took over the brand in the late 1950s. In 1965, Fender distributed five models of banjo under the Regal name, as the \\"exclusive distributors\\". It is not clear when Fender ceased to commercialised Regal products. In an effort to reintroduce the brand to global markets and focusing on overseas production sources, Saga Musical Instruments acquired the Regal name in 1987 and has steadily produced a complete line of metal and wood body resophonic instruments.The history of the famous Regal guitar on Jags House website  Brand owners  * Emil Wulschner & Son (1896‚Äì1904) * Lyon & Healy (1904‚Äì1954) * Harmony Company (1954‚Äìlate 1950s) * Fender (1950s‚Äì?) * Saga Musical Instruments (1987‚Äìpresent)  References   External links  * Regal on Saga Music website * Banjo FAQ * The Banjo Story * Metal-bodied Regal Dobro, 1940, with historical background Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Chicago Category:History of Chicago ","title":"Regal Musical Instrument Company"},{"id":"4877908","text":"The name Gretel has been used for two tropical cyclones in the Australian region. * Cyclone Gretel (1985) * Cyclone Gretel (2020), crossed into the South Pacific.

The plan of creating a school of higher learning for Eastern Christianity had been on the agenda of the Catholic Church since at least Pope Leo XIIICl. Soetens, Congr√®s eucharistique de J√©rusalem (1893), Louvain 1977, 725, the idea being at first to found it in Constantinople and to choose the White Fathers to run it as well as to renew the Greek College. , but it was only realized in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV (1914-1921). The Orientale forms part of the consortium of the Pontifical Gregorian University (founded in 1551) and the Pontifical Biblical Institute (founded in 1909), both in Rome. All three institutions are run by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). While the Orientale depends on the Holy See, its management is entrusted to the Society of Jesus. Its Chancellor is the Prefect of the Congregation for the Eastern Churches and its Vice-chancellor is the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, while the Congregation for Catholic Education is the dicastery competent for approving the academic programmes of the Orientale. The student population for the academic year 2018-2019: 351 in the Faculty of Eastern Ecclesiastical Sciences (SEO); 71 in the Faculty of Eastern Canon Law (DCO); Total: 422, of whom 242 were guest students. Each year, another approximately 400 scholars visit the library for research purposes. Mission The Pontifical Oriental Institute is a school of higher studies that has as its particular mission the service of the Oriental Churches. It is to make known to the churches of the East ‚Äúthe immense richness ... preserved in the treasure chests of their traditions‚Äù (GP II, Orientale Lumen 4) and equally to make known to the Latin West these riches so little explored. Its mission is to pursue research, teaching, and publishing related to the traditions of the Eastern Churches in their theology, liturgy, patristics, history, canon law, literature and languages, spirituality, archaeology, and questions of ecumenical and geopolitical importance. The aim of the Orientale is to educate students already in possession of a first academic degree, irrespective of their religious affiliation, Latin or Eastern Catholic, Orthodox or otherwise, to deepen their knowledge of the Christian East in its Churches, theology, spirituality, liturgy, discipline, history, and culture. The student population comes largely from the countries of the Eastern churches: the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa (Egypt, Ethiopia, and Eritrea), and Asia (Mesopotamia; Kerala, India), with a significant number of students from Europe and the Americas interested in learning about the Christian East. Today, with the flood of migrants and refugees from some of the above countries, students also come from the diaspora communities.  History  = The Early Years = Santa Maria Maggiore by Alberta Pisa (1905) The Orientale‚Äôs first provisional seat was in the immediate vicinity of the Vatican, in the Palazzo dei Convertendi, Piazza Scossacavalli, which later had to give way to Via della Conciliazione.Roberta Maria Dal Mas, ‚ÄúIl Palazzo dei Convertendi e la casa di Raffaello‚Äù, Claudio Parisi Presicce e Laura Petacco (ed.s), La Spina: dall‚ÄôAgro vaticano a via della Conciliazione, Roma 2016, 129-129, here 129. The Institute was briefly re-located to the current premises of the Pontifical Biblical Institute, in via della Pilotta, 25, Rome until 1926 when it settled into its permanent seat at Piazza di Santa Maria Maggiore, 7.V. Poggi, ‚ÄúIl Pontificio Istituto Orientale‚Äù, Per la storia del Pontificio Istituto Orientale, Roma 2000, 15-30, 23. Of all churches in Rome, the Basilica of St. Mary Major in the same square is the one which evokes the East most closely. Its famous mosaics were executed under Pope Sixtus III (432-440) to celebrate the third ecumenical council of Ephesus (431), which, by emphasizing that Jesus Christ is one person, brought out as a consequence that Mary, his Mother, is the Mother of God, or the Theotokos, as the Greeks call her. As the Basilica prides itself on having the relics of the crib, it is thus liturgically known as ‚Äúad Praesepe‚Äù, the Church of the Crib. Here, moreover, in the late 860s the apostles of the Slavs, Saints Cyril and Methodius, deposited their liturgy books, an indication that now, after the pope‚Äôs approval, one could celebrate the liturgy in Church Slavonic. In a side street opposite against the Orientale there is the Basilica of Santa Prassede, with its Carolingian mosaics attesting Pope St Pascal I‚Äôs revulsion against the iconoclasm which at the time of the construction of the Basilica (817) had resumed in the East. Nearby, there is a marble slab reminding us that St Cyril, St Methodius‚Äô brother, died there in 869. As part of the complex of the block where the Orientale is there is the church of St. Anthony the Great (S. Antonio Abate), of whom all Easterners are particularly fond. He is also popular in Rome, where people still recall the times when the blessing of the animals took place in this church. Ever since the creation of the Pontifical Russian College in 1929, known as the Russicum, by Pius XI (1921-1939), the church has been run by Jesuits living in the college.C. Simon, Pro Russia: The Russicum and Catholic Work for Russia, Rome 2009, 404-432. In many ways, therefore, the position of the Orientale is ideal. = The First 100 Years = Mgr Michel d'Herbigny, Bishop and Rector of the Pontifical Oriental Institute (Rome) The Orientale was created as a twin institution to the Congregation for the Eastern Church, whose name would change in 1967 to Congregation for the Eastern Churches. Without the link to this important organ of the Holy See, it would be impossible to grasp the purpose and mission of the Orientale, nor how the Orientale could be founded in the midst of the ‚Äúuseless massacre‚Äù of World War I, 1917. The question to which the creation of the Orientale was meant to be the answer had been long in coming. Known as la question d‚ÄôOrient, the question was first posed after the Ottoman‚Äôs humiliating defeat at the hands of the Russians in 1774 (cf. the Treaty of Kutchuk-Kainarji), becoming ever more poignant ever since Napoleon set foot in Egypt in 1798: what was to be done with the millions of Christians under the Ottomans once the Ottoman empire would disappear? The question reached its acme in the Eucharistic Congress of Jerusalem in 1893, when the Eastern Catholic Patriarchs made the grievances of their communities known to the papal legate, Cardinal Beno√Æt Langenieux, who forwarded them to the pope. Leo XIII at once convoked an assembly of Eastern Catholic Patriarchs for the following year (1894), from which emerged the apostolic letter Orientalium dignitasOrientalium dignitas Ecclesiarum: document in V. Peri, Orientalium varietas, Roma 1994, 334-339., known as the Magna Charta of the rights of Eastern Catholics. With the collapse of the Russian empire a reality after the February revolution of 1917 and the demise of the Ottoman empire in sight, the pope decided to act.The documents which report the consultations which had been going on for years before such a decision could be taken have been edited in a typewritten form not destined for the general public by Cardinal N. Marini as Opinamenta et vota quoad pontificiam in Urbe pro ecclesiarum orientalium dissidentium Concordia institutionem, Rome 1917. With the motu proprio regarding the Eastern Congregation, Providentis DeiDei providentis arcano: documento in V. Peri, Orientalium varietas, Roma 1994, 344-346. (1.05.1917), the pope created the Oriental Congregation; with the other motu proprio Orientis catholici Orientis Catholici: documento di Benedetto XV in V. Peri, Orientalium varietas, Roma 1994, 372.(15.10.1917), he created the Orientale.See on this: C. Koloevskij, La foundation de l‚ÄôInstitut Pontifical Oriental, in E.G. Farrugia (ed.), The Pontifical Oriental Institute: the First Seventy-five Years 1917-1992, Rome 1993, 65-106, introduction by A. Raes. G.M. Croce has edited five highly informative volumes of Cyrille Korolevskij (1878- 1959), Kniga bytija moego (Le livre de ma vie): M√©moires autobiographiques, 1-5, Vatican City 2007. The pope reserved to himself the prefecture of the new Congregation, whose head was therefore only a Secretary, although a cardinal (cfr. canon 257 of the Pio-BenedectineThe term ‚ÄúPio-Benedictine‚Äù refers to the two popes under whom the Codex iuris canonici of 1917 was carried out. Initiated in 1904 under Pius X in 1904, it was finished by Benedict XV. Codex Iuris canoniciN. Loda, ‚ÄúCodex Iuris Canonici 1917‚Äù, EDCE, 465-466. of 1917 specified precisely this). Already three years after founding the Orientale, Benedict XV granted it, through the apostolic constitution, Quod nobis in condendo, the right to confer degrees.Quod nobis in condendo, in V. Peri, Orientalium varietas, Roma 1994, 373-374. From the start the pope insisted on the necessity of a richly supplied Eastern library Orientis catholici, no. VII. In V. Peri, Orientalium varietas, Roma 1994, 373.to second the study and the research of the Orientale population.Pope Benedict XVAt the beginning the professors were chosen from various orders and even among lay people. These were a White Father, Antoine DelpuchV. Poggi, Per la storia del Pontificio istituto Orientale, Roma 2000, 147-153. (1868-1936), who served as pro- president. Poggi, ‚ÄúIl Pontificio Istituto Orientale‚Äù, Per la storia del Pontificio istituto Orientale, Roma 2000, 15-30, 18. Poggi calls Delpuch ‚Äúpreside delegato‚Äù or ‚Äúpro-preside‚Äù, with the comment that Cardinal Marini was ultimately responsible before the pope for the Orientale, manifested by the fact that the recruitment of the first professors was done by the cardinal. in the first year of the Orientale‚Äôs functioning (1918-1919); two Benedictines, including Ildefonso Schuster; three Assumptionists, including Martin Jugie (1878-1954), a professor at the Orientale for only the first few years, but who was to write a monumental synthesis of the history of Eastern theology; a Dominican; a Mechitarist; four Jesuits, including Guillaume de Jerphanion (1877-1948), a famous archaeologist; two Russians, a Greek and an Ethiopian; and three lay persons, including Michelangelo Guidi, an outstanding philologist and a historian.V. Poggi, Per la storia del Pontificio istituto Orientale, Roma 2000, 154-174. Soon after Pius XI became pope he felt that it would be better if one order took care not only of running the place but also of preparing those who could eventually take over. His choice fell on the Jesuits, and in a brief to Fr. General Vladimir Ledochowski (14.09.1922) he entrusted to the Order the Orientale.Breve di Pio XI al p. Ledochowski, Preposito Generale della Compagnia di Ges√π V. Peri, Orientalium varietas, Roma 1994, 374-375. This had been the suggestion of Abbot Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, OSB, who had also become, in the meantime, the first full president. Now it was the turn of the first Jesuit president (1922-1931), and that was Michel d‚ÄôHerbigny (1880-1957). A very talented man, he managed to impart to the nascent institution new √©lan, with its own publications and even the new seat in the Piazza di Santa Maria Maggiore. Complications on his very delicate mission to Russia led to his early retirement. D‚ÄôHerbigny was followed as president by Emil Hermann (1932-1951), a German canon lawyer of note, whose prudence helped him guide the Institute during the war period; Ignacio Ortiz de Urbina (1951-1957), a Basque and a renowned patristic scholar; Alphonse Raes (1957-1962), an accomplished Syriac scholar who became Prefect of the Vatican Library; Joseph Gill (1962-1963), a great expert on the Council of Florence (1438-1445) and chief editor of the Acts of this council; and again Joseph Gill (1964-1967), who in 1965 began to bear the title of Jesuit Rector; Ivan ≈Ωu≈æek (1967-1972), later the secretary of the Pontifical Commission for the revision of Eastern canon law; Georges Dejaifve (1972-1976), noted ecumenist; Eduard Huber (1976-1981), former rector of the Meudon School of Russian; Peter-Hans Kolvenbach (1981-1983), who after a brief stint became Superior general of the Society of Jesus for a quarter of a century (1983-2008); Gilles Pelland (1984-1986), who was soon made rector of the Gregorian University; Gino Piovesana (1986-1990), whose experience as rector of the Sophia University of Tokyo and his expertise in Russian philosophy stood him in good stead; Clarence Gallagher (1990-1995), a canon lawyer, dean and rector; Gilles Pelland (1995-1998), the only rector to have two different terms separated in time; H√®ctor Vall Vilardell (1998-2007), whose aplomb assured him nine years as rector; Cyril Vasil‚Äô (2007-2009), who after two years became Secretary of the Congregation; Sunny Kokkaravalayil (May 2009-May 2010), who was pro-rector for a year and superior for seven; James McCann (2010-2015), who after leaving office became Senior Vice President of the Gregorian Foundation, New York; Samir Khalil Samir, who was pro-rector from 20 April 2015 to 25 August 2015, and David Nazar (2015-), in whose term the Orientale was not only re-structured but also became fused, as a community, with the adjoining community of the Pontifical Russian College, popularly known as Russicum.V. Poggi, ‚ÄúPontifical Oriental Institute‚Äù, in E.G. Farrugia, Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Christian East, 1503-1506. The hundred year history of the institution (1917-2017) may tentatively be divided, first, into an eleven year period at the beginning, when the Orientale was trying to assert itself and become recognized, which came with Pius XI‚Äôs encyclical dedicated to the Orientale, Rerum orientaliumPius XI, Rerum Orientalium, in V. Peri, Orientalium varietas, Roma 1994, 376-383. (1928). Then followed a thirty-year period bringing us to the eve of Vatican II (1928-1958), when already some of the rich harvest that was expected began to be reaped, and the foundations for others to build on had been laid. Yet the next thirty years after the council up to 1989, the fresh breath of Vatican II brought accrued interest in the Christian East and in the Orientale. When with 1989 Eastern Europe opened up, a new chapter of the Orientale‚Äôs relating to the hitherto forbidden East started and many new students from these countries could now study at the Orientale.E.G. Farrugia, ‚ÄúBenedetto XV e la fondazione del Pontificio istituto Orientale (1917): lungimiranza, intuizione, riflessioni a posteriori‚Äù, Benedetto XV: Papa Giacomo della Chiesa nel mondo dell‚Äô‚Äúinutile strage‚Äù, a cura di G.

The Very Reverend Arturo Sosa, SJ, Superior General of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to his left. = The 21st Century = In accord with modern pedagogical standards for academic research, the library has been refitted with air conditioning, high-end LED lighting, modern acoustics, and increasingly digitized resources. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Orientale (1917-2017) Pope Francis visited the Institute on October 12, 2017. His generous donation has brought about a general re-structuring of the now enlarged Orientale, providing modern professorial offices, student dining room, and lounges for faculty and students. The Orientale uses G Suite and Google for Education while its internet service has been augmented to 1 gigabyte up and down. This allows the conference hall to stream conferences online and affords the possibility of courses and conferences online with the aid of Google Hangout. Classroom lighting and acoustics have been upgraded to meet modern digital and pedagogical norms.  The Library  Students working in the library The Pontifical Library of the Institute is without a doubt the greatest gem of the Orientale. It is one of the best equipped libraries regarding the Christian East in the world. Some books which were discarded during the early years of the Soviet Union were bought for the Orientale Library, such that it alone has the entire Pravda collection, for example. The library space was considerably enlarged by John Paul II after his visit to the Orientale in 1987. The ‚Äúaula magna‚Äù, a conference hall which hosts part of the library and was re-furbished for the centenary celebrations in 2017, provides a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù for international discussions on problematic yet delicate themes. Syria, autocephaly, genocide, nonviolence, are some of the themes to which imams, diplomats, Patirarchs, Cardinals, and ‚Äúpeople on the ground‚Äù have participated.  Academics  = Faculties and Languages = The Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major, which shares the square with the Pontifical Oriental Institute As an Institute, the Orientale has only two faculties, one for ecclesiastical sciences, the other for Eastern canon law. At first there was only one faculty, and it comprised the programme already outlined in Benedict XV‚Äôs founding charter (1917), that is theology, comprising spirituality, liturgy, and canon law, plus archaeology and such subsidiary sciences as are necessary to secure a balanced programme of societal structures, art, culture, history. In this curriculum, languages play a major part, and, besides Italian which is the main teaching language, ancient Greek, Syriac, Russian, and Church Slavonic, have always loomed large. Besides Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Georgian, which have become part and parcel of the curriculum, in recent years modern Greek and Romanian have been added. Modern Greek is divided into four levels, whereby one may obtain a diploma from the Greek government. For canon law students, Latin is required and taught. A well-developed Italian language programme has become the hard core of the propaedeutic year. Branching off from the Faculty of Eastern Ecclesial Sciences, the faculty of canon law was created in 1971, partly in view of the revision of Eastern canon law and a corresponding codex. Secretary of this commission was Fr. Ivan ≈Ωu≈æek (1924-2004). The Orientale, with its professors of canon law, continues to serve as the main centre for the elaboration of the Code which is used around the world by both Catholic and Orthodox churches of the East. = Publications = Archbishop Rowan Williams at the Orientale for the 2016 Donahue Chair lectureBesides instruction for licentiate to doctoral degrees, the Orientale has acquired a name for its publications. In 1923 appeared the first number of Orientalia christiana. When hundred such numbers had been published, the series was divided, in 1934, in Orientalia Christiana Analecta, exclusively for monographs, and Orientalia Chrisitana Periodica, for articles and book reviews.V. Poggi, ‚ÄúPontifical Oriental Institute (Orientale): Publications‚Äù, 1506-1509, in EDEC (Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Christian East). These publications were written by experts in the field and acquired by libraries. After the promulgation of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO), in 1990, it was decided to launch a new series for monographs in canon law. In 1992 a new publication, Kanonika, was published, whose first number appeared in 1992.G. Nedungatt, ‚ÄúKanonika‚Äù, EDEC, 1509-1510. The critical edition of Anaphorae Orientales, beginning with Alphonse Raes in 1939, brought attention to one among the many forgotten treasures of the Christian East and has been continued by the renowned liturgist of the Orientale, Professor Robert Taft, SJ. When William Macomber published the oldest known text of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, little could he have imagined how useful it was for the Congregation of Faith in 2001 when it decided for the orthodoxy and validity of an anaphora without the explicit words of consecration.E.G. Farrugia, ‚ÄúAnaphores Orientales‚Äù, EDEC, 1510-1512.  Notable Achievements  Symposium on the crises in Syria hosted at the Orientale, 2017 The CCEO was to a large extent prepared at the Orientale. It represents a huge step forward for Easterners because, for the first time, they have a law of their own, allowing each of the sui juris Churches in the East to further develop its own particular law. (b) Another monumental contribution was the critical edition of the documents of the Council of Florence (1438-1445)G. Hofmann et al. (editors), Concilium Florentinum: Documenta et Scriptores, 1-11, Rome 1940-1976. by the professors of the Faculty of Eastern Ecclesial Sciences. This led to the decision of Pius XII in 1947 to purify the Armenian Catholic Rite of Latinization.E.G. Farrugia, ‚ÄúIs there method to ecumenism? Two examples to make a point‚Äù, in Christianity East and West: Jesuit Reflections, Boston 2016, 47-72, here 50-51. Among other scholarly works of note are the finest study to date, in 6 volumes, of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom; the Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Christian East; annotated translations of 9th-13th-century Syrian manuscripts; a seven- volume edition of Vatican archival documents on the Armenian Question (1894-1925); a similar edition on the Chaldean-Assyrian question (1908-1938); annotated catalog of 150 Ethiopian manuscripts; detailed archaeological studies of mosaics, frescoes, and architecture of the early church in Asia Minor, and so on.  Notable Professors  Renowned liturgist of the Orientale, Professor Robert Taft, SJ. Guillaume Jerphanion, SJ, made a name for himself through his study of archaeology and the rock-hewn churches of Cappadocia.G. de Jerphanion, Une nouvelle province de l‚Äôart byzantin: les √©glises rupestres de Cappadoce, 1-5, Paris 1925-1942. Marcel Viller, SJ, after teaching patristics at the Orientale, moved to become one of the founders of the monumental Dictionnaire de Spiritualit√©. According to his successor Cardinal Tom√°≈° ≈†pidl√≠k, SJ, himself a noted exponent for Russian spiritual theology, Iren√©e HausherrR. ƒåemus (a cura di), ‚ÄúLe trace della Provvidenza‚Äù; intervista a Padre ≈†pidlik‚Äù, in AAVV, ‚ÄúA due polmoi.‚Äù Dalla memoira spirituale d‚ÄôEuropa, Roma 1999, 26. laid the foundations of Eastern spirituality, and his books sell as if they were written yesterday ‚Äì as do the works of Juan Mateos, SJ, who, in the wake of Anton Baumstark (1872-1948), is considered by R.F. Taft, SJ and G. Winkler, to have founded at the Orientale ‚ÄúThe Mateos School of Comparative Liturgiology‚Äù.E.G. Farrugia, ‚ÄúMateos, Juan‚Äù, EDCE, 1234-1236. Georg Hofmann, SJ, was a German Church historian, who had a big part in the editing of the Florentine Acts.

In 1971 the posthumous retrospective exhibition of Varo drew the largest audiences in its history - larger than those for Rivera and Orozco.  Background  Details of the Museum of Modern Art of Mexico City. A forerunner of the MAM, the National Museum of Plastic Arts, was created in 1947 by Carlos Ch√°vez. This first museum was located inside the Palacio de Bellas Artes. However, this museum was more than modest and provisional in part because of the museological conception of modern art since it was considered just one chapter in a broader curatorial script that traversed the history of Mexican art since the pre- Hispanic Mexico/pre-Hispanic times. Shortly after, in 1953, Carmen Barreda, the then director of the Salon de la Plastica Mexicana and who would later become the first director of the MAM from 1964 to 1972, founded a board with the intention of building an enclosure destined, on purpose, to preserve, study and disseminate the modern art; This project took more than ten years to materialize. = Building = The building of the Museum of Modern Art of Mexico was based on the design of the architects Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez and Carlos A. Cazares Salcido (Professor at the University of Sonora), in collaboration with Rafael Mijares Alc√©rreca. A part of the original project, which included an auditorium, library and wineries, was never completed. The design of the gardens and walkways corresponds to Juan Siles, with the direction of the artist Helen Escobedo.  Collections  Sculptures in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City. Sculptures in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City. The museum focuses on displaying modern Mexican art, mainly from the decade of 1930 onwards.

Like other Mexican art museums, the MAM has a very wide collection of modern and contemporary Mexican art, which by limitations of physical space is known by means of temporary exhibitions. The museum's lobby and gardens are adorned with sculptures by great national and international artists. Among nationals represented are Gelsen Gas, Germ√°n Cueto, Mathias Goeritz, Estanislao Contreras and Manuel Felgu√©rez. The theme of the museum mainly covers what is known as the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura and the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura. Exhibitions of international contemporary art are also presented.

Prado's 2017 and 2018 seasons were severely hampered by a series of different injuries which landed him on the disabled list seven separate times. On March 26, 2017, the Marlins placed Prado on the 15-day disabled list due to a Grade 1 hamstring strain, an injury he suffered during the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Prado returned to the DL in mid-May after his hamstring began bothering him again and did not return until the end of June. He then injured his knee in mid-July making an off-balanced throw and later in the same game tweaking it during an at-bat. Prado ended up missing the rest of 2017 after needing surgery to repair the injured knee. His recovery from that knee surgery took longer than expected and he began the 2018 season on the DL. Upon his return in May, Prado struggled at the plate and only hit .194 before straining his left hamstring in a game on May 25 and was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Prado returned to action on July 5 and hit at a .290 clip upon his return. However, Prado injured his left quadriceps in a game on Aug 13 and was placed on the disabled list yet again.

A Shankha (conch shell) with Vishnu emblem carved. A Shankha is a conch shell of ritual and religious importance in Hinduism. It is the shell of a large predatory sea snail, Turbinella pyrum, found in the Indian Ocean.. In Hindu mythology, the shankha is a sacred emblem of the Hindu preserver god Vishnu. It is still used as a trumpet in Hindu ritual, and in the past was used as a war trumpet. The shankha is praised in Hindu scriptures as a giver of fame, longevity and prosperity, the cleanser of sin and the abode of goddess Lakshmi, who is the goddess of wealth and consort of Vishnu. The shankha is displayed in Hindu art in association with Vishnu. As a symbol of water, it is associated with female fertility and serpents (NƒÅgas). The shankha is the state emblem of the Indian state of Kerala and was also the national emblems of the Indian princely state of Travancore, and the Kingdom of Cochin. The shankha is one of the eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism, the Ashtamangala, and represents the pervasive sound of Buddhism. A powder made from the shell material is used in ayurveda as a treatment for stomach ailments. In the Western world, in the English language, the shell of this species is known as the \\"divine conch\\" or the \\"sacred chank\\". It may also be simply called a \\"chank\\" or conch. The more common form of this shell is known as \\"right-turning\\" in a religious context, although scientists would call it \\"dextral\\". A very rarely encountered form has reverse coiling which is called \\"left-turning\\" in a religious context, but is known as \\"sinistral\\" or left-coiling in a scientific context. Characteristics This shell is from a sea snail species Turbinella pyrum in the family Turbinellidae. This species is found living in the Indian Ocean and surrounding seas. The shell is porcelaneous (i.e. the surface of the shell is strong, hard, shiny, and somewhat translucent, like porcelain). The overall shape of the main body of the shell is oblong or conical. In the oblong form, it has a protuberance in the middle, but tapers at each end. The upper portion (the siphonal canal) is corkscrew-shaped, while the lower end (the spire) is twisted and tapering. Its colour is dull, and the surface is hard, brittle and translucent. Like all snail shells, the interior is hollow. The inner surfaces of the shell are very shiny, but the outer surface exhibits high tuberculation. In Hinduism, the shiny, white, soft shankha with pointed ends and heavy is the most sought after. Types Based on its direction of coiling, the shankha has two varieties: *The Vamavarta (\\"left-turned\\" as viewed with the aperture uppermost): This is the very commonly occurring dextral form of the species, where the shell coils or whorls expand in a clockwise spiral when viewed from the apex of the shell. In Hinduism, a dakshinavarta shankha symbolizes infinite space and is associated with Vishnu. The Vamavarta shankha represents the reversal of the laws of nature and is linked with Shiva. *A Dakshinavarti Shankh: This is the very rare sinistral form of the species, where the shell coils or whorls expand in a counterclockwise spiral if viewed from the apex of the shell. The Dakshinavarta shankha is believed to be the abode of the wealth goddess Lakshmi ‚Äì the consort of Vishnu, and hence this type of shankha is considered ideal for medicinal use. It is a very rare variety from the Indian Ocean. This type of shankha has three to seven ridges visible on the edge of the aperture and on the columella and has a special internal structure. The right spiral of this type reflects the motion of the planets. It is also compared with the hair whorls on the Buddha's head that spiral to the right. The long white curl between Buddha's eyebrows and the conch-like swirl of his navel are also akin to this shankha. The Varaha Purana tells that bathing with the Dakshinavarta shankha frees one from sin. Skanda Purana narrates that bathing Vishnu with this shankha grants freedom from sins of seven previous lives. A Dakshinavarta shankha is considered to be a rare \\"jewel\\" or ratna and is adorned with great virtues. It is also believed to grant longevity, fame and wealth proportional to its shine, whiteness and largeness. Even if such a shankha has a defect, mounting it in gold is believed to restore the virtues of the shankha. =In Bhagavad Gita= In Bhagavad Gita, the name of different Shankhas of Pandavas and Kauravas are mentioned: Uses puja In its earliest references, shankha is mentioned as a trumpet and in this form it became an emblem of Vishnu. Simultaneously, it was used as a votive offering and as a charm to keep away the dangers of the sea. It was the earliest known sound-producing agency as manifestation of sound, and the other elements came later, hence it is regarded as the original of the elements. It is identified with the elements themselves. To make a trumpet or wind instrument, one drills a hole near the tip of the apex of the shankha. When air is blown through this hole, it travels through the whorls of the shankha, producing a loud, sharp, shrill sound. This sound is the reason the shankha was used as a war trumpet, to summon helpers and friends. Shanka continued to be used in battles for a long time. The sound it produced was called shankanad. Nowadays, the shankha is blown at the time of worship in Hindu temples and homes, especially in the ritual of the Hindu aarti, when light is offered to the deities. The shankha is also used to bathe images of deities, especially Vishnu, and for ritual purification. No hole is drilled for these purposes, though the aperture is cut clean or rarely the whorls are cut to represent five consecutive shells with five mouths. Shankha is used as a material for making bangles, bracelets and other objects. Because of its aquatic origin and resemblance to the vulva, it has become an integral part of the Tantric rites. In view of this, its symbolism is also said to represent female fertility. Since water itself is a fertility symbol, shankha, which is an aquatic product, is recognised as symbolic of female fertility. In ancient Greece, shells, along with pearls, are mentioned as denoting sexual love and marriage, and also mother goddesses. Different magic and sorcery items are also closely connected with this trumpet. This type of device existed long before the Buddhist era. =Ayurveda= Shankha is used in Ayurveda medicinal formulations to treat many ailments. It is prepared as conch shell ash, known in Sanskrit as shankha bhasma, which is prepared by soaking the shell in lime juice and calcinating in covered crucibles, 10 to 12 times, and finally reducing it to powder ash. Shankha bhasma contains calcium, iron and magnesium and is considered to possess antacid and digestive properties. Significance A sacred shankha on the flag of Travancore, India The sound of the shankha symbolises the sacred Om sound. Vishnu holding the conch represents him as the god of sound. Brahma Vaivarta Purana declares that shankha is the residence of both Lakshmi and Vishnu, bathing by the waters led through a shankha is considered as like bathing with all holy waters at once. Sankha Sadma Purana declares that bathing an image of Vishnu with cow milk is as virtuous as performing a million yajnas (fire sacrifices), and bathing Vishnu with Ganges river water frees one from the cycle of births. It further says \\"while the mere sight of the conch (shankha) dispels all sins as the Sun dispels the fog, why talk of its worship?\\" Padma Purana asserts the same effect of bathing Vishnu by Ganges water and milk and further adds doing so avoids evil, pouring water from a shankha on one's own head before a Vishnu image is equivalent to bathing in the pious Ganges river. In Buddhism, the conch shell has been incorporated as one of the eight auspicious symbols, also called Ashtamangala. The right- turning white conch shell (), represents the elegant, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of Buddhism, which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare and the welfare of others. Shankha was the Royal State Emblem of Travancore and also figured on the Royal Flag of the Jaffna kingdom. It is also the election symbol of the Indian political party Biju Janata Dal. In Hindu iconography and art A shankha carved Shankha is one of the main attributes of Vishnu. Vishnu's images, either in sitting or standing posture, show him holding the shankha usually in his left upper hand, while Sudarshana Chakra (chakra ‚Äì discus), gada (mace) and padma (lotus flower) decorate his upper right, the lower left and lower right hands, respectively. The shankha on the right is the icon for Vishnu at the Dattatreya temple, Bhaktapur Nepal Avatars of Vishnu like Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Narasimha are also depicted holding the shankha, along with the other attributes of Vishnu. Krishna ‚Äì avatar of Vishnu is described possessing a shankha called Panchajanya. Regional Vishnu forms like Jagannath and Vithoba may be also pictured holding the shankha. Besides Vishnu, other deities are also pictured holding the shankha. These include the sun god Surya, Indra ‚Äì the king of heaven and god of rainJansen pp. 66‚Äì7 the war god Kartikeya,Jansen p. 126 the goddess VaishnaviJansen p. 131 and the warrior goddess Durga. Similarly, Gaja Lakshmi statues show Lakshmi holding a shankha in the right hand and lotus on the other. Sometimes, the shankha of Vishnu is personified as Ayudhapurusha \\"weapon-man\\" in the sculpture and depicted as a man standing beside Vishnu or his avatars.Rao, p. 156 This subordinate figure is called the Shankhapurusha who is depicted holding a shankha in both the hands. Temple pillars, walls, gopuras (towers), basements and elsewhere in the temple, sculpted depictions of the shankha and chakra ‚Äì the emblems of Vishnu ‚Äì are seen. The city of Puri also known as Shankha-kshetra is sometimes pictured as a shankha or conch in art with the Jagannath temple at its centre. Shaligrams are iconographic fossil stones particularly found in the Gandaki River in Nepal which are worshipped by Hindus as representative of Vishnu. The shaligrama ‚Äì which has the marks of a shanka, chakra, gada and padma arranged in this particular order ‚Äì is worshipped as Keshava. Twenty-four orders of the four symbols defined for Shaligrama are also followed in worship of images of Vishnu with different names. Out of these, besides Keshava the four names of images worshipped starting with Shankha on the upper hand, are: Madhusudanah, Damodara, Balarama and Vamana.Rao pp.231-232 In Hindu legend A Hindu legend in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana recalls the creation of conchs: Shiva flung a trident towards the asuras, burning them instantaneously. Their ashes flew in the sea creating conchs. Shankha is believed to be a brother of Lakshmi as both of them were born from the sea. A legend describes an asura named Shankhasura, who was killed by Vishnu's fish avatar, Matsya. A sadhu sounding the shankha. In the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata, the symbol of Shankha is widely adopted. In the Ramayana epic, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna are considered as part-incarnations of Sheshanaga, Sudarshana Chakra and Shankha, respectively, while Rama, their eldest brother, is considered as one of the ten Avatars of shri Vishnu. During the great Mahabharata war, Krishna, as the charioteer of the Pandava prince and a protagonist of the epic ‚Äì Arjuna ‚Äì resounds the Panchajanya to declare war. Panchajanya in Sanskrit means 'having control over the five classes of beings'. All five Pandava brothers are described having their own shankhas. Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva are described to possess shankhas named Ananta-Vijaya, Poundra- Khadga, Devadatta, Sughosha and Mani-pushpaka, respectively. Association with nƒÅgas Because of the association of the shankha with water, nƒÅgas are often named after the shankha. The list of NƒÅgas in the Mahabharata, the Harivamsha and the Bhagavat Purana includes names like Shankha, Mahashankha, Shankhapala and Shankachuda. The last two are also mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka Tales and the Jimutavahana. A legend states that while using Shankha as part of meditative ritual, a sadhu blew his shankha in the forest of village Keoli and a snake crept out of it. The snake directed the sadhu that he should be worshipped as NƒÅga Devata (Serpent God) and since then it has been known as Shanku Naga. Similar legends are narrated at many other places in Kullu district in Himachal Pradesh.

Nonfiction. By his life he shows us with the help of strong desire of getting something , human can do impossible works., item 10 Early life Bhaumik was born on March 30, 1931 in a small village in Tamluk, Medinipore, West Bengal, India and attended the Kola Union High School.\\"Code Name God: The Spiritual Odyssey of a Man of Science\\", The Crossroad Publishing Company, New York, 2005; Penguin Books, April 2006Bengali Biography entitled \\" MANIKANCHAN\\" by Ronjan Banergee, Ananda Publishers, 1999, ISBNA 81-7215-568-9 As a teenager, Bhaumik spent some time with Mahatma Gandhi in his Mahisadal camp. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Scottish Church College and an M. Sc. from the Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta. He won the attention of Satyendra Nath Bose (creator of the Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics) who encouraged his prodigious curiosity. Bhaumik became the first student to receive a Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur when he received his Ph.D. in quantum physics in 1958.From a village boy, $150m and example to follow, Shiv Sahay Singh, Thu Aug 25 2011, Kolkata His thesis was on Resonant Electronic Energy Transfers, a subject he would have cause to use in his work with lasers. Scientific career Receiving a Sloan Foundation Fellowship in 1959, Bhaumik went to the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) for post doctoral studies. In 1961, he joined the Quantum Electronics Division at Xerox Electro-Optical Systems in Pasadena and began his career as a laser scientist. Concurrently, he taught Quantum physics and Astronomy at the California State University at Long Beach. In 1968, he was enlisted by the Northrop Corporate Research Laboratory, where he rose to become the director of the Laser Technology Laboratory and led a team that made contributions in research on excimer laser technology. One of the papers on this research was presented at the Denver, Colorado meeting of the Optical Society of America in May 1973.Laser Focus, May 1973, Vol. 9, #5, Page 10-14 \\" The News in Focus\\"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, October 1973, Page 1039 At this meeting, Dr. Bhaumik presented substantial evidence to demonstrate for the first time that an excimer laser could be efficient and powerful enough for practical utilization. The application of excimer lasers in Lasik eye surgery has resulted in vision correction in many cases. The most widespread application of excimer laser has been in photolithography, a critical technology used in the manufacturing of microelectronic devices like cell phones. His contributions to the development of new and high power lasers merited his election by his peers to be a fellow of both the American Physical Society and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Bhaumik's current interest is performing innovative research in deciphering the century old enigma of quantum physics as well as sharing with the public the advances in quantum physics and cosmology and their implications for our lives, work, technology, and spiritual development. This he endeavors to do through books such as the Code Name God and The Cosmic Detective, articles, lectures, and TV programs like the Cosmic Quantum Ray. He is also interested in research on the origin and the nature of consciousness and how that knowledge can be utilised in improving the quality of our existence. Bhaumik has published over fifty papers in various professional journals and is a holder of a dozen laser- related U.S. patents. He has been invited to lecture all over the world, at forums including: Summer School on High-Power Gas Lasers, Capri, Italy 1975; International Symposium on Gas-Flow and Chemical Lasers, Belgium 1978; International Symposium on Gas Discharge Lasers, Grenoble, France 1979; Asoke Sarkar Memorial Lecture, Calcutta International Book Fair 2001; Institute of Culture, Calcutta, India 2006; Kolkata Society for Asian Studies, Kolkata, India 2015. Books, media, and philanthropic activities His search spanned a decade and led him to the inference that the One Source at the hub of all spiritual traditions is grounded in scientific reality and not a mere creation of blind faith. He also argues that science and spirituality are indeed two sides of the same coin, the coin being that unique human consciousness that allows us to perceive both ourselves and objective reality. Therefore, he argues in his book Code Name God (Crossroads Publishing), the big divide between science and spirituality can be bridged. The trick, Bhaumik asserts, is to see things in an entirely new light‚Äìa light shed upon by the recent revelations of quantum physics and cosmology. He now devotes much of his time and energy to bringing this message to the public, including its younger members, for whom he has recently published The Cosmic Detective (Penguin 2008), a primer on cosmology, and created an animated television series, Quantum Ray, shown on the HUB channel. Bhaumik has instituted an annual International Award through the UCLA Neuropsychiatry Institute to acknowledge the best scientific evidence demonstrating the effect of mind in healing. He has been involved in numerous community activities through his association with the Los Angeles Bombay Sister City Association; the Los Angeles St. Petersburg Sister City association; the Long Beach Calcutta sister City Association and others. He has donated to various charitable organizations including the Thalians of Los Angeles. He also established the Bhaumik Educational Foundation, based in Kolkata, which provides full scholarships to needy but brilliant students who wish to apply themselves to studies in science and technology. he has also made an $11 million gift to UCLA to establish an Institute of Theoretical Physics. Spiritual views =Code Name: God= First published in the U.S. in 2005, Code Name God (Crossroads Publishing ) is a distillation of Bhaumik's central thesis that the discoveries of modern physics can be reconciled with the great truths of the world religions when those truths are viewed as elements of what Aldous Huxley called \\"The Perennial Philosophy.\\" In particular, Bhaumik finds strong support in advanced physics and cosmology for the Neo-Platonic notion of \\"the One\\" (identified here as \\"The Source\\"), and conjectures that this existential source may reside in what is known as the quantum vacuum state and be in some manner co-eternal and co-equal with human consciousness. The book and its premise have been praised by luminaries of both the literary and scientific words, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who wrote, \\"This example of a personal spiritual growth ... and re-evaluation of material values ... arouses very warm feelings. God is one and there are no major differences between religions.\\" Fritjof Capra, author of The Tao of Physics, wrote \\"... the attempt to find common ground between Eastern spirituality and Western science is eloquently told and makes for fascinating reading.\\" Code Name God is both an autobiography, chronicling significant events in its author's life in tandem with the revelations that accompanied them, and a contemplation on the astounding implications of quantum physics. In the author's words, \\"the surprising discovery of quantum physics that the primary source of everything in the universe is present in each minutest stitch of the fabric of space of this immensely vast cosmos empowers us to ponder the One Source of all creation. It is not merely a blind faith anymore. This ought to enable us to feel ourselves as an inextricable part of the One Source, which would significantly improve the quality of our lives.\\" The book, which has enjoyed considerable success in Bhaumik's native India, has also drawn plaudits from recognized European scientists such as Professor Walter Thirring, the former director and head of the theory division at CERN, Geneva, who asserts in the foreword to its German edition, \\"Dr. Bhaumik's portrayal of a higher power embedded in the fabric of the universe and responsible for its continuing existence and operation is consistent with his reliance on the highly technical and mathematical intricacies of the Quantum Field Theory, an area of study to which I had the opportunity of making some significant contributions.\\" pages 9-11 Thirring and Bhaumik are among a still relatively small group of \\"hard scientists\\" who have openly acknowledged the spiritual implications of quantum physics and cosmology. =The Cosmic Detective= Published in 2009 by Penguin (), The Cosmic Detective is a primer on modern cosmology for the general but scientifically inclined reader. It was selected as an official book by the secretariat of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009) declared by the UN General Assembly. The slogan of IYA2009 was \\"THE UNIVERSE -YOURS TO DISCOVER,\\" an exhortation for us to reevaluate our place in it in light of the revolutionary discoveries of modern cosmology. The presentation of the discoveries of modern cosmology in this book has been praised by experts as well as others interested in the field. Dr. Catherine Cesarsky, President of the International Astronomical Union states,\\"The Cosmic Detective is an inspirational read. Bhaumik tackles topics with impressive scope, yet delves into them with spirit rarely seen. Marrying scientifically accurate text with accessible language is no easy task, but The Cosmic Detective is a proof that it can be done.\\" Dr. Walter Thirring, the former head of the theory division at CERN, Geneva, has said, \\"The Cosmic Detective reveals another of Mani Bhaumik's talents: he is an outstanding science writer to complement his demonstrated scientific insight. He has the unique ability to distill from the voluminous material the essential concepts for the general public.\\" Apollo 14 Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, in his foreword to the book, writes, \\"Mani Bhaumik builds on recent developments in science to bring us new pictures, larger views and insights about the magnificence of our universe.\\" The book has been published in seven languages.

He was born around 1150 and died in 1234 or 1235. He is sometimes called Robert IV, but there is no solid evidence for the name Robert, and the name can cause confusion, since his first cousin once removed was Robert IV, Count of Auvergne, who died in 1194. Dalfi d'Alvernha was the son of William VII the Young of Auvergne, Count of Clermont, and of Jeanne de . He married Guillemette de Comborn, Countess of Montferrand, daughter of Archambaud, Viscount of Comborn, and Jourdaine of P√©rigord. Their children were A√©lis, Guillaume (William, later Count of Clermont), Blanche, and Alix. Troubadours who worked with Dalfi or sang at his court include Peirol, Perdigon, Peire de Maensac, Gaucelm Faidit, and Uc de Saint Circ; his cousin, bishop Robert of Clermont, exchanged satirical and erotic verses with him, as did Richard Coeur de Lion. One partimen between Dauphin and Perdigon marks a stage in the poetical debate, begun by Guilhem de Saint-Leidier and taken up by Azalais de Porcairagues and Raimbaut of Orange, as to whether a lady is dishonoured by taking a lover who is richer than herself.

In contrast to the songs from Roxy Music's eponymous debut album, this song starts suddenly without any instrumental fanfare. As with the rest of the album, the song was recorded at AIR Studios, Oxford Street, London. Lyrics In the mode of early 1960s \\"dance craze\\" songs such as \\"The Twist\\", the song tries to convince the listener to dance \\"The Strand\\", which takes its name from a film noir advertisement for Strand cigarettes. The lyrics include, as is typical for early Roxy Music, references to notable art, including The Sphinx, the Mona Lisa, Lolita and Picasso's Guernica. Bryan Ferry described his idea for \\"The Strand\\" as \\"the 'dance of life' ‚Äì thus bringing to mind earlier dance phenomena, such as the avant garde passion and exuberance of both The Ballets Russes and the controversial Jazz Age dance craze 'The Charleston'.\\" The song gives no instructions on how The Strand should be danced. Simon Puxley, writing in 1973, suggested that the dance was \\"indefinable\\" and best thought of as \\"where it's at, whatever turns you on. The buzz, the action, the centre, the quintessence, the energy.\\" Single \\"Do the Strand\\" was released as a single in 1973 in some countries but not in the UK. That same year, however, the band performed the song on the UK television music show The Old Grey Whistle Test. It was released as a single in the UK in 1978 to promote Roxy Music's Greatest Hits album, but it failed to chart. Despite this, the song remains one of the most popular amongst the band's fans, especially at live concerts. Covers The German synthpop band Alphaville recorded a cover version of \\"Do the Strand\\" for their 2003 album CrazyShow.

One of the two main protagonists of the overall series (the other being Laurie Strode), he appears in seven of the eleven Halloween films, first appearing in John Carpenter's original 1978 film. Donald Pleasence plays the character in five films and Malcolm McDowell portrays him in the 2007 reimagining, Halloween and its sequel Halloween II. Throughout the Halloween franchise, he is depicted as the archenemy to the series' central character and primary antagonist, Michael Myers. Dr. Loomis' name was derived from Sam Loomis, played by John Gavin in the 1960 film Psycho.DEBRA HILL'S SPEECH - A 1998 INTRODUCTION TO HALLOWEEN Appearances =Films= Dr. Samuel Loomis first appears in the original Halloween (1978). He is a psychiatrist and his patient is Michael Myers. He and his colleague Marion Chambers drive to Warren County Smith's Grove Sanitarium to escort Michael to court. Loomis reveals to Marion that Thorazine will be used before Michael is presented to the judge, as he wants Michael to have no chance to be released back to society. As they approach the main gate at the sanitarium, they notice that the patients are wandering about, and Loomis gets out of the car to investigate, allowing Michael, who has escaped, to steal Loomis's car, nearly attacking Marion. Loomis goes to Haddonfield, Illinois after Michael escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Once in Haddonfield, he goes to the local cemetery and discovers that Judith Myers' tombstone is missing, thus confirming his suspicion that Michael returned home. He meets with Sheriff Leigh Brackett, and the two begin their search at Michael's former home, where Loomis attempts to warn the skeptical sheriff about the danger Michael poses for the residents of Haddonfield, explaining that Michael is pure evil and capable of further violence, despite having previously remained in a seemingly catatonic state for fifteen years. Sheriff Brackett patrols the streets while Loomis waits and watches the house, expecting Michael to return there. Loomis discovers the stolen car, and begins searching the streets when he sees Tommy Doyle and Lindsey Wallace running frantically from a house. Loomis investigates and sees Michael attacking Laurie Strode. Loomis draws his revolver and shoots Michael six times, knocking him off the balcony; when Loomis goes to check Michael's body, he finds it missing. An unsurprised Loomis stares off into the night, while Laurie begins sobbing in terror. Halloween II (1981) picks up directly after the first film, with Laurie being taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital while Brackett accompanies Loomis in his search for Michael. Loomis mistakes teenager Ben Tramer for Michael, when Ben gets hit by a squad car which pins him to another vehicle that bursts into flames, leading to his death. Sheriff Brackett learns his daughter Annie was killed by Michael. Blaming Loomis for her murder, a grieving Brackett leaves the manhunt to inform his wife, leaving Deputy Gary Hunt in charge to help Loomis. Loomis is informed that Michael broke into the local elementary school. As he investigates, he discovers clues connecting Michael to Samhain and the occult which might explain his seeming indestructibility, but Marion arrives to escort him back to Smith's Grove on the governor's orders under the enforcement of a US Marshal. Along the way, Marion tells Loomis that Laurie is Michael's sister; Laurie was put up for adoption after the death of Michael's parents, with the records sealed to protect the family. With the realization that Michael is after Laurie, and being told that she was taken to Haddonfield Memorial, Loomis forces the Marshal to drive back to Haddonfield. Loomis, Marion, and the Marshal reach the hospital just in time to save Laurie. As Marion attempts to contact the police, Michael kills the Marshal and chases Loomis and Laurie into an operating theater. Michael stabs Loomis in the stomach, wounding him, but Laurie shoots Michael in the eyes, blinding him. Loomis and Laurie fill the room with oxygen and ether. Loomis orders Laurie to run and tells Michael that \\"it's time\\" and proceeds to cause an explosion, blowing up the operating room with him and Michael inside, immolating them both in the fire. Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room before finally falling dead. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) picks the story up ten years after the events of Halloween II. Michael has been in a comatose state since the explosion, and awakes when he learns Laurie Strode has died in a car accident, but has a daughter, Jamie Lloyd. Loomis goes to Haddonfield after learning that Michael has escaped. He follows Michael to a gas station, where he has killed a mechanic for his clothes, along with a clerk and disabled the phones. Michael then escapes in a tow truck and causes an explosion, destroying Loomis's car in the process. Loomis is then forced to catch a ride to Haddonfield. Loomis warns the new sheriff, Ben Meeker, that Michael has returned. Michael attacks the police station and kills all of the officers. A lynch mob is formed by the town's men to kill Michael once Loomis reveals he's returned, refusing to let a repeat of ten years ago occur again. Loomis goes to protect Jamie Lloyd from her uncle. After Michael Myers is shot and falls down a mine shaft. Jamie and Rachel are brought back to their foster parents', the Carruthers' house. Loomis arrives with Sheriff Meeker and is finally convinced that \\"Michael Myers is in Hell, where he belongs.\\" However, Loomis hears Mrs. Carruthers' scream, and sees Jamie standing at the top of the stairs, wearing a clown mask, holding a pair of scissors in her hand, with her costume stained with blood, similar to Michael when he killed his older sister Judith. Sheriff Meeker prevents Loomis from shooting her and both men, Mr. Carruthers, and Rachel watch in horror, realizing that Jamie is following in Michael's footsteps. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989), taking place a year later, has Loomis assigned to Jamie at the Haddonfield Children's Clinic, treating her for attacking her foster mother under Michael's influence. Aware that Michael is still alive, and discovering that Jamie is telepathically linked with him, Loomis constantly pressures her to inform him of Michael's whereabouts, but Jamie is too traumatized to tell him. When Michael returns, Loomis sets a trap for Myers at his house, which involves Jamie recreating an eerie recreation of Judith Myers' final moments before her murder. Michael arrives, and Loomis tries to reason with him, proposing that he fight his rage and redeem himself through a positive relationship with Jamie. Loomis' words seem to work at first, as Michael calmly listens to him and lowers his knife, but when Loomis reaches to take away Michael's knife, he subdues him. When Loomis awakens, he uses Jamie as bait, and lures Michael into a trap to weaken him with a tranquilizer gun. After beating Michael unconscious with a wooden plank, Loomis suffers a stroke and collapses. In Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995), Loomis has retired and moved to a hut on the outskirts of Haddonfield, where he lives as a hermit. He is visited by his old colleague Dr. Terence Wynn, who is chief administrator at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Wynn tries to persuade Loomis to return to Smith's Grove, but Loomis declines. At the same time they hear the voice of Jamie Lloyd on the radio begging Loomis to help her. It turns out that Jamie was impregnated by a druid cult, with Michael's DNA, that had kidnapped her and Michael six years earlier. However, she succeeds in escaping after giving birth to a baby boy. She takes the child with her, and stops at a bus station to contact the radio station being broadcast at the moment. Michael tracks her down and kills her, but cannot find the baby. Jamie had left her son in the bus stop bathroom, where he is found by Tommy Doyle, the boy whom Laurie Strode was baby-sitting in 1978. He names the child Steven. The following morning Jamie's body is discovered, and Loomis is devastated. He thought she was the last of Michael's bloodline, but after being approached by Tommy Doyle at the hospital who tells him about his discovery of the baby. In all of this, it is revealed that Michael is under control of the curse of \\"Thorn\\", a power he has been cursed with by the druid cult since he was a young boy after hearing voices telling him to kill his family. This explains why Michael is evil and want to kill his family. In the meantime another six-year-old boy named Danny Strode, who is living with his family in the old Myers home is being taunted by the man in black to kill like Michael was years back. That Halloween night, Dr. Wynn reveals himself to be the leader of the cult. After this discovery, Loomis and Tommy are drugged and later follow Wynn to Smith's Grove who abducted Danny, his mother, and Steven with the help of his cult followers. Loomis confronts Wynn who wants him to join in on his conspiracy, and reveals that Jamie's baby represents a new cycle of Michael's evil that he kept secret from most of the cult who were focused on inflicting the curse onto a new child, Danny, to carry out a new trend of family sacrifices. Loomis calls Wynn out on his scheme and is knocked unconscious. Later, Michael butchers Wynn's team of staff surgeons during a medical procedure and Wynn himself during a medical procedure with Danny and Steven sitting in a room next door. Tommy then joins forces with Kara Strode (Danny's mother and Laurie Strode's cousin) in order to protect Jamie's baby from Michael. They succeed, and after regaining consciousness, Loomis helps them escape the hospital. Michael is finally subdued by Tommy, who injects him with large quantities of tranquilizers inside the Smith's Grove Sanitarium. As Tommy, Kara, Danny, and Steven leave, Loomis refuses to come with them as he has \\"a little business to attend to\\". Back inside the building, Michael's mask is seen lying on the floor of the lab room, and Loomis is heard screaming in the background, leaving the fate of both men unknown. In the original cut of the film, after telling the others he has got \\"a little business to attend to\\", Loomis walks back into the sanitarium to find a seemingly-defeated Michael lying on the floor of the main hallway, after being stopped by Tommy, who used runes. Upon removing the mask, Loomis finds Dr. Wynn, who was forced by Michael to switch outfits so he could escape. With his dying breath, Wynn grabs Loomis's hand and says, \\"It's your game now, Dr. Loomis.\\" After Wynn dies, the Thorn symbol appears on Loomis's wrist; realizing now that he himself is now to act as the leader of the cult, Loomis screams in terror and despair (this scream is heard as ambient noise in the final frame of the theatrical cut). Ignoring the events of the previous three films, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) establishes that Michael Myers has been missing for twenty years since the explosion in 1978. He kills Marion Chambers at Loomis' retirement house. Two investigators discuss what they know about Loomis' life in this alternate version of the series, following the events of the first two films. Having survived the explosion in 1978, Loomis was under Marion's care at this house in his final years before dying. However, even after nearly 20 years, Loomis refused to believe that Michael was dead, and devoted the rest of his life to studying all information about his former patient. The two investigators enter his private study, and find that the walls are covered with photographs, sketches, and newspaper articles about Michael. A new version of Dr. Samuel Loomis appears in the remake (2007). In the film, Dr. Loomis seems not to have contempt for Michael, and Michael doesn't truly see him as his nemesis. Their relationship with one another is more of a tragic friendship. Loomis does not immediately shoot Michael, but tries to reason with him. Loomis is first seen as a child psychiatrist brought in by ten-year-old Michael Myers' school to speak with Michael's mother, Deborah. After seeing the various animals Michael has tortured and killed, he recommends that the boy get help. After Michael commits three murders on Halloween, he is put under Loomis' care at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. On some days the two talk peacefully, on others Michael has outbursts of violent rage. Fifteen years later, Loomis writes a best-selling book based on Michael's treatment called \\"The Devil's Eyes\\". On his last day at Smith's Grove, Loomis tells Michael that he has tried but cannot help him anymore. He also tells Michael that he has become something like his best friend. After Michael escapes, Loomis concludes that his former patient is going to Haddonfield. Once there, he enlists the help of Sheriff Lee Brackett, and also buys a gun. Loomis comes to believe that Michael has returned to find his little sister, Laurie, who Brackett helped get adopted by the Strodes after her mother committed suicide. Michael succeeds in tracking Laurie down, killing her friends and two police officers in the process. Loomis is alerted of Michael capturing Laurie by Tommy Doyle and Lyndsey Wallace, the children Laurie is babysitting, and sets off to the Myers house. There he confronts Michael as he approaches Laurie, begging Michael to stop, but as Michael ignores him and continues forward, Loomis is left with no choice but to shoot Michael. Loomis rescues Laurie, but Michael soon reawakens to continue the attack on his sister. Loomis again tries to reason with him at which point Michael lets Laurie go and subdues Loomis. In the unrated version of the film, when Michael is in pursuit of Laurie through the house, Loomis grabs his foot to try and stop him. Michael shakes him off and Loomis blacks out. In the film's original ending, Loomis is successful in convincing Michael to let go of Laurie as he is surrounded by police officers, telling Michael he \\"did the right thing\\". Despite Loomis' protests, however, Michael is killed shortly afterwards in a hail of gunfire, and the film ends with Loomis looking down sadly at his former patient's corpse. In the sequel (2009), Loomis' character is revised; he is now seen as a greedy, arrogant mercenary who is profiting from the murders of the previous film. He does not believe Michael is alive and becomes annoyed and angry when asked about it. He goes on a tour to promote a new book, \\"The Devil Walks Among Us\\", while his assistant is shown to be disgusted with his campaign. In the climax of the film Loomis, after realizing Michael is still alive, realizes that he has changed for the worse and tries to save Laurie, this time unarmed. Michael ambushes Loomis and kills him by slashing his face and stabbing him in the chest. In the unrated version Michael tackles Loomis out of the shack and then stabs him in the stomach while Loomis is still trying to reason with him. With Loomis injured and unconscious (it is not revealed whether he lived or died), the police open fire on Michael, killing him. Laurie, now completely insane, leaves the shack, picks up Michael's knife and walks over to Loomis' unconscious body. Against Brackett's orders, the police open fire on Laurie, apparently killing her too. Halloween (2018) ignored all of the previous sequels in the franchise and served as a direct sequel to the 1978 film, taking place forty years later, and establishing that Michael was arrested following his killing spree in 1978, and spent forty years back in Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Loomis is presented as having died an unspecified time ago prior to the film's events, with the role of protagonist taken up by Laurie Strode. Loomis appears in a sketch of him testifying at a court hearing, seemingly Michael's trial for the 1978 murders, and gives a statement about Michael in a 1979 interview which also refers to Michael as his former patient, suggesting Loomis stopped treating Michael after the 1978 murders. It is also revealed that when Michael was arrested in 1978, Loomis was prevented from killing him by Deputy Frank Hawkins, who arrested Michael. Michael's new psychiatrist, Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), although established as a former student of Loomis', is mainly interested in Michael out of a desire to \\"understand\\" his psychology as opposed to Loomis arguing that Michael be kept contained and executed while adhering to all legal requirements. This contrast comes to a head when Sartain not only contributes to Michael's escape during a bus crash, but actually kills Hawkins when he tries to kill Michael. Sartain briefly wearing Michael's mask before taking him to Laurie Strode's house so that he can observe them both in action. Sartain is subsequently killed when Michael crushes his skull by stomping on it. =Literature= Samuel Loomis's first literary appearance was in October 1979, in Curtis Richards' novelization of Halloween, which largely follows the events of the film. He also appeared in the 1981 adaptation of Halloween II written by Jack Martin; it was published alongside the first film sequel, with the novel following the film events, with an additional victim, a reporter, added to the novel. The final novelization to feature Loomis was Halloween IV, released October 1988. The novel was written by Nicholas Grabowsky, and like the previous adaptations, follows the events of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers. Loomis appears in the online short story Halloween: Sam, focusing on what happened to his character in the H20 timeline after Halloween II. Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from Autopsis Marcus Smith, Sam is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website HalloweenComics.com. It explores the life of Dr. Loomis, including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington, a journalist he met during World War II. In 1995, Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in a hospital and murders Elizabeth in front of him. Loomis attempts to stop him, but dies of a coronary failure. In the comic Halloween: One Good Scare. Loomis is revealed to have a son, David Loomis, who like him, is a doctor at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Although continuing his father's work, David is careful not to inherit his obsession with Michael Myers. However, when Lindsey Wallace is admitted to Smith's Grove claiming that Michael is stalking her, he finds history repeating itself. David neglects his other patients to interview Lindsey, investigates Michael's history, and even visits his childhood home in Haddonfield. However, on Halloween night in 2003, Michael arrives at Smith's Grove, murdering his way through the staff to get to Lindsey. David tries to protect her, but his fear gets the better of him and he hides as Michael drags Lindsey away to her death. Michael is sure to leave a cracked picture frame containing a photograph of David and his father, a message that he plans to return for him. David is also mentioned in the comic Halloween: Sam, set in 1995, when Marion tells Sheriff Brackett that he has not visited his ailing father. The character's name and appearance was actually derived from the 1998 fan-film Halloween: Inferno. Casting The role of Dr. Loomis was originally intended for Peter Cushing, who had appeared as Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars (1977); Cushing's agent rejected Carpenter's offer due to the low salary. Christopher Lee was also approached for the role; he too turned it down, although the actor would later tell Carpenter and Hill that declining the role was the biggest mistake he made during his career. Yablans then suggested Pleasence, who agreed to star because his daughter Lucy, a guitarist, had enjoyed Assault on Precinct 13 for Carpenter's score. In 1998's Halloween H20, the voice of Dr. Loomis is heard giving the same speech that he gave to Sheriff Brackett when they were inside Michael's abandoned childhood home in the original film. Audio clips from Halloween were initially considered when playing his monologue. However, instead of the voice of Donald Pleasence himself, sound- alike voice actor Tom Kane provides this voice-over. He reprised the role of Loomis in a few Halloween fan films, such as Halloween: Awakening and The Last Halloween: The Death of Michael Myers. Loomis is featured in a vocal cameo in 2018's Halloween, in which a pair of journalists studying Michael for a podcast listen to a recording of Loomis, made on January 22, 1979, three months after the events of the original film, where Loomis advises that Michael be executed, to the point that he requested that he be allowed to actually confirm that Michael's heart had stopped beating for himself and then witness as the body was cremated, claiming that Michael needed to be killed because there was no point in keeping evil alive. Loomis is voiced by sound- alike comedian Colin Mahan.

Knock Castle, also known as Caisteal Chamuis (Castle Camus) is a former stronghold of the MacDonalds. It lies on the east coast of Sleat, approximately north of Armadale on the Isle of Skye, south of Cnoc Uaine, on the eastern side of Knock Bay. Currently the castle is in ruins; it consists of an old 15th century keep of which one part, a window, remains to some height with traces of later buildings. The castle was constructed by the Clan MacLeod and later captured by the Clan MacDonald in the late 15th century. Ownership of the castle passed between the two clans several times. It was remodelled in 1596 by the MacDonalds. By 1689 the castle was abandoned and started to decay. Most of the stones were then used for nearby buildings. It is claimed by tradition that the castle is haunted by a Green Lady or glaistig ‚Äì a ghost associated with the fortunes of the family who occupy the castle. The ghost will appear happy if good news is to come; if there is bad news she will weep. The castle is also said to have had a gruagach, a spirit which is said to have a particular concern with caring for the livestock. Touring Knock Castle There is no way to get to Knock Castle directly by vehicle. There is a private road just off the A851 that leads down toward working farm buildings. The trail to the castle can be found by following the road to a livestock gate. Hidden in the vegetation on the right side of the pathway is a small wooden picket gate covered with lichen. On the other side of the gate is a faint trail that will eventually lead across a river to the castle, passing in front of a collapsed red-roofed farm building. The easiest approach to the castle is by following the trail upward after passing the farm building. On the right hand side after the farm building are the remains of what appears to be a blacksmith's forge. The castle is in a state of heavy decay and is not maintained. Travelers are advised to proceed at their own risk, as the old masonry work can be unstable. The castle itself is surrounded on three sides by a very steep cliff, and footing can be slippery during rains. The ruins are a scheduled monument.

The Hall became especially associated with watercolours. The old Water-Colour Society exhibited there in 1821‚Äì22, and it was hired by Charles Heath to display the watercolours commissioned by from Joseph Mallord William Turner forming Picturesque Views in England and Wales. Turner exhibited at the Hall for a number of years and it was also used as a venue for exhibitions by the Society of Painters in Water Colours. In the \\"Dudley Gallery\\" at the Egyptian Hall, the valuable collection of pictures belonging to the Earl of Dudley was deposited during the erection of his own gallery at Dudley House in Park Lane. The room gave its name to the Dudley Gallery Art Society (also known as The Old Dudley Art Society) when they were founded in 1861 and used it for their exhibitions. It was the venue chosen for their first exhibitions by the influential New English Art Club. The hall was used principally for popular entertainments and lectures. Here Albert Smith related his ascent of Mont Blanc, illustrated by some cleverly dioramic views of the Alpine peaks. Advertisement for Arcana at the Egyptian Hall, in 1888 By the end of the nineteenth century, the Hall was also associated with magic and spiritualism, as a number of performers and lecturers had hired it for shows.

Hardeen, who usually billed himself as the \\"brother of Houdini\\", was the founder of the Magician's Guild. Hardeen was the first magician to conceive escaping from a straitjacket in full view of the audience, rather than behind a curtain.Hardeen, Theodore. (1903). Life and History of Hardeen. A promotional pamphlet sold at performances wherein Hardeen explains how he came to do the straitjacket escape in front of an audience. Hardeen does not take credit for the idea, he merely states the facts. Early life Hardeen was born as \\"Ferenc Dezs≈ë Weisz\\" (or \\"Ferencz Dezs≈ë Weisz\\") in Budapest, Austria-Hungary and went by the name \\"Theodore Weiss\\" when he and his family were living in Appleton, Wisconsin. He was known as \\"Deshi\\" and later \\"Dash\\" by his parents. In 1893, Hardeen performed with Houdini at Coney Island as \\"The Brothers Houdini\\". While he and Harry were there, Harry met and married Wilhelmina Beatrice \\"Bess\\" Rahner. Magical career Houdini (seated left) c. 1901. Will Goldston, English stage magician and editor of the Magician Annual, wrote that: After his brother's death in 1926, Hardeen played the vaudeville circuit, doing many of his late brother's routines. From 1938 to 1941, he was featured in Olsen and Johnson's Broadway revue, Hellzapoppin. During World War II, he performed for the troops (as his brother had done during World War I). In 1936, Hardeen starred in a Vitaphone short film for Warner Bros. called Medium Well Done. In it, Hardeen played a \\"hardboiled detective\\" on the case of a bogus medium. The film was directed by Lloyd French, who directed many of the early Laurel and Hardy shorts. Like his brother, Hardeen was skeptical of the claims of spiritualist mediums. With his friend Julien Proskauer he exposed the fraudulent methods of mediums. Houdini, in his will, requested for all his files to be given to Hardeen and destroyed (\\"I give, devise and bequeath to my brother, Theodore, Professionally known as \\"Hardeen\\" all my theatrical effects, new mysteries and illusions and accompanying paraphernalia, to be burnt and destroyed upon his death.\\")Randi, James; Sugar, Bert Randolph.

On August 15, 1927 Hardeen's Brooklyn home had been broken into and some of Houdini's apparatus had been damaged. Later that year, Hardeen burned all of Houdini's personal files in a furnace in his basement.Kalush, William; Sloman, Larry. (2006). The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero. Atria Books. pp. 530-531. Planning on writing a book about his brother, in 1945 Hardeen went to Manhattan's Doctors Hospital for a simple operation. He unexpectedly died of complications while recovering from the procedure. He was 69 years old. Legacy During his final show on May 29, 1945 in Ridgeway, Queens,The source says Ridgeway, Queens. This may be a mistake for Ridgewood, Queens. Hardeen named his chief assistant, Douglas Geoffrey, his official successor. Geoffrey then went on to perform as \\"Hardeen, Jr.\\"; he died January 14, 1990 at the age of 82. Richard Valentine Pitchford (1895‚Äì1973) took over the Magicians' Guild after Hardeen's death. Sidney Hollis Radner received the Houdini collection from Hardeen.

Lyrically, the song is a sinister monologue, part critique of the emptiness of opulence, partly a love song to an inflatable doll. Musically this is complemented by a cycling four-bar chord progression,(D# F# F G#) led by a 'cinema organ' style Farfisa part. After the lyrical conclusion \\"I blew up your body/but you blew my mind!\\", the song climaxes with an extended instrumental section, with the lead taken by guitarist Phil Manzanera. On the original vinyl LP, the song was the last one on side A, and appeared to fade out into the run-out groove, only to return, heavily processed with phase shifting techniques. This audio pun is preserved on the CD release. The song is one of the most iconic and popular in the Roxy Music catalogue, having been performed by them for instance on the BBC Old Grey Whistle Test show, and regularly in live sets, as featured on Roxy Music's live albums Viva! and Concerto. The band's live performance on an edition of the German Beat Club shows Mackay playing the organ part, with Ferry on rhythm guitar. Eno replaces the studio phase-shifting process with tape delay techniques. In 2019, the song was used in the television series Mindhunter. It was played over the cold open of Season 2/Episode 1 depicting American serial killer Dennis Rader. The song was also used in the film The Gentlemen when Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam) breaks into a council estate flat. Cover versions The song has been covered by Jared Louche of Chemlab, Rozz Williams and Gitane Demone on their album Dream Home Heartache, the album's title referencing the song, Jane Birkin on her Rendez-Vous album of 2004.Dave Thompson, [ Rendez-Vous album Review]. - Allmusic It has also been performed in concert by Peter Murphy on his 2009 tour. Another version was recorded by Fields of the Nephilim as the B side for their 1987 single Blue Water. Canadian anticon related alternative hip hop artist Buck 65 covered the song on his sixth solo album Vertex from 1999. Mike Patton-fronted supergroup Tomahawk have covered the song in live sets. Bassist John Taylor, during his solo period after leaving Duran Duran in 1997, organized a Roxy Music tribute album called Dream Home Heartaches: Remaking/Remodeling Roxy Music (released 1999). The title song was covered by Xan.John Taylor's Trust The Process website Former Chemlab vocalist Jared Louche covered the song with The Aliens for his 1999 solo debut Covergirl.

The wines this grape yields can be quite powerful and tannic, with a deep violet color and a slight bitterness. On the palate, there are strong currant, wild berry and plum flavors. The wine can stand some aging (depending on variety), and after a period of four-to-ten years, it achieves a floral quality as well. Refosco should be served at 16 ¬∞C (60.8 ¬∞F), or if it is particularly rich in tannin, at 18 ¬∞C (64.4 ¬∞F). It goes best with charcuterie, game, and grilled poultry. Varieties Slovenian refosco grapes There are several varieties of refosco family:http://www.chalmersnurseries.com/www/varieties/refoscodalpeduncolo/refoscodalpeduncolo.htm Chalmers Nurseries - Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso, accessed 2011-06-22Vina Steras - Refo≈°k, Slovene, accessed 2011-06-22 * Refosco dal peduncolo rosso - probably the most internationally recognizable refosco wine. Cluster has the red stalk (peduncle), referring to the red stem that holds the grapes to the vine. In the attempt of making the wine more approachable to an international palate, recent versions have taken well to new oak and cold fermentation. The most well known examples of Refosco come from the Colli Orientali region of Friuli. * Refosco d'Istria (Refosko Istriano or Refosco dal pedunculo verde) - this variety is grown in Slovenian and Croatian parts of Istria, and around Trieste in Italy under the name of Refo≈°k or Refosco d'Istria. This wine does not benefit from protracted aging. * Teran or Terrano - this refosko variety (and wine) is typical for Carso DOC and Slovenian Karst region under the name Teranno Carso or Kra≈°ki teran respectively.Friuli ‚Äì Venezia Giulia Wines, accessed 2011-06-22Matkurja - Teran, accessed 06/29/2011 It is also grown in Croatian Istria on a very similar red soil under the name Istarski Teran or Teran‚ÄìCroatian Istria.

It is very rare and produced in small quantities. It is said to be the parent of all other refosko grapes in the region as it has many characteristics of all other refosco varieties (including high levels of acids and iron typical for Teran) Refosco di Faedis * Refosco di Rauscedo http://www.eu- vitis.de/datasheet/accDataResult.php?data=ITA368%23SANOSVALDO%2F254U55-79 The European Vitis Database - Refosco di Rauscedo * Refosco nostrano The European Vitis Database - Refosco nostrano * Refoscone The European Vitis Database - Refoscone \\\\- some say that this is just Refosco di Fadeis.Friuli Tipico - La grande famiglia del vino Refosco friulano: dal Refoscone al Terrano, Italian, accessed 06/29/2011 *Refosco di Guarnieri, another name for the Veneto wine grape Trevisana .J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 1084-1085 Allen Lane 2012 Origin and history The Refosco family have a very long history, but details of the early history are not clear. DNA analysis of Refosco dal Pedunculo Rosso has revealed a relationship with Marzemino, another ancient variety of northern Italy. Some authorities have previously suggested that Mondeuse noire, which is primarily found in the Savoy region in eastern France, is identical to Refosco dal Pedunculo Rosso due to the similarity of the wines. DNA analysis has shown that this is not the case, and that the two varieties are unrelated. Several oenologists believe that wines made from Refosco family grapes are the old Roman puccinum. The grapes were well known in antiquity and a variety of Refosco wine was praised by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder in the first century for its quality. In his work Naturalis Historia he mentioned that puccinum was made of grapes grown in the north Adriatic near the spring of Timavo - a typical Karst river: :... This is the Region of the Carni, joining that of Japides : the River Timavus, and the Castle Pucinum, famous for good Wine. ... :Pliniy, Natural History, CHAPTER XVIII. Venetia, the tenth Region.)

This theory was supported by Italian Prof. Gianni DalmassoUniversita di Torino - Fondazione Giovanni Dalmasso who claimed that Livia could not like the bitter taste of Refosco wine and that the only possible wine she could like was a sweet variety of prosecco grown in the Trieste region. There is also a comment on the medieval map Prosecho ol:Pucinum, hinc vina a Plinio  tantopere laudata (Prosecho, once called Pucinum. From here comes wine highly praised by Plinius), from Gregorio Amaseo, (1464‚Äì1541).Cartographica Neerlandica Background for Ortelius Map No. 129 Even the famous Giacomo Casanova liked the Refosco wine, as he describes it in his book of memories: :...

Translated by Willard R. Trask. JHU Press. 1966Google Books - History of My Life, Giacomo Casanova, Willard R. Trask It is believed that one of the reasons the Habsburgs built the Parenzana railway from Trieste to Poreƒç was because they liked the wines from the region (Refosco, Malvasia and Teran). That is also why the railway was often referred to as a wine railroad or vineyard railway.History of Istria Wines See also * Terrano (grape) * List of grape varieties References Category:Red wine grape varieties Category:Slovenian wines Category:Italian wine Category:Croatian wine Category:Wine grapes of Slovenia Category:Wine grapes of Italy Category:Wine grapes of Croatia ","title":"Refosco"},{"id":"4878090","text":"Pogonotomia is the art of shaving, from the Greek words œÄœéŒ≥œâŒΩ pogon \\"beard\\" and œÑŒ≠ŒºŒΩœâ t√©mno, to cut.
