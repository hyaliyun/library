Plot Much to the despair of her husband John (Emmett Vogan), wealthy New York socialite Margaret Morgan (Betty Blythe) hires former criminals Masie O'Donnell (Patsy Moran) and Butch Grogan (Eddie Gribbon) to be her house servants. When she goes to court because her daughter Brenda (Joan Marsh) has been arrested for reckless driving, Margaret is moved to hire Muggs (Leo Gorcey, who has been arrested for vagrancy and being a public nuisance, after the judge insists that he get a legitimate job. Now a chauffeur, Muggs brings the whole East Side Kids gang with him and puts them to work polishing cars. Muggs is instructed on proper etiquette, and when an engagement party is held for Brenda and her conservative fiancé Virgil (Stanley Brown), Muggs and the gang serve the food. At the end of the evening, one of the guests discovers that her diamond necklace is missing, and John accuses the East Side Kids of the theft. However, everyone recalls seeing a stranger at the party, whom Maisie now remembers as someone she met at Danceland, a dance hall on the lower East Side. Muggs convinces John not to call the police until he and the boys have had a chance to investigate. Maisie goes downtown to Danceland with Brenda, who dresses up like a gangster's moll in order to fit in. They meet with gangster Dips Nolan (Gabriel Dell) and learn that he plotted the jewelry heist with Diamonds, who was the stranger at the party. Nolan becomes suspicious when naïve Virgil, who has followed Brenda to the dance hall, uses her real name and asks him to throw a fake fight so that he can prove his manhood. Nolan instead knocks Virgil out and kidnaps Brenda. Muggs and Glimpy (Huntz Hall), meanwhile, see Diamonds leave for the dance hall and search his apartment. Although they find nothing, Diamonds and Nolan return with Brenda, and the entire East Side Kids gang captures the criminals and retrieves the diamonds. Later, Brenda is pleased to find that Virgil's East Side adventure has transformed him into a more confident and adventurous person.

(Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) Jacopo Strada (Mantua, 1507 – Prague 1588) was an Italian polymath courtier, painter, architect, goldsmith, inventor of machines, numismatist, linguist, collector, and merchant of works of art.For Strada's role as a merchant of works of art, see Dirk Jacob Jansen, \\"Jacopo Strada et le commerce d'art\\", Revue de l'art 77 (1987:11-21; John F, Hayward, \\"Jacopo Strada, XVIth century antique dealer, Art & Auction 1971-12 (1973:68-74). His portrait by Titian has kept his image familiar.His career at the court of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, is one of four selected as exemplars by Howard Louthan, The Quest for Compromise: Peacemakers in Counter-Reformation Vienna (Cambridge University Press) 1997. . Biography He is supposed to have received early training as a goldsmith in the Mantua workshops of Giulio Romano; drawings of Giulio's Palazzo del Tè and of its painted interiors and those of the Palazzo Ducale at Mantua, datable 1567-68, are attributed to Jacopo Strada, intended for his Descrizione di tutta Italia.Egon Verheyen, \\"Jacopo Strada's Mantuan Drawings of 1567-1568\\" The Art Bulletin 49.1 (March 1967:62-70). From 1552 to 1555 he sojourned in Lyon and travelled to Rome in the service of Pope Paul III, and after his death his successor Marcellus II, upon whose sudden death he returned north. From 1556 onwards he settled at Vienna and from 1576 served as an official artist and architect to three successive Habsburg Holy Roman emperors, Ferdinand I, Maximilian II and Rudolph II. He also worked for Albert V, Duke of Bavaria, for whom he conceived the Antiquarium to house the antiquities at the Munich Residenz; the Roman sculptures that he assembled for the Duke may still be seen in the setting he devised there. He also served as the friend and trusted agent of the Augsburg patrician, humanist and book-collector, and a friend and advisor of Albrecht, the immensely rich Jakob Fugger (1516–1557), for whom he scouted works of art in Italy from his headquarters in Mantua. On Fugger's commission he assembled a comprehensive array of coats of arms of Italian nobility, filling fifteen volumes, for Fugger's library. A suite of drawings of ancient coins, that Strada did for Fugger, has found its way into Duke Albrecht's collection and is preserved at Gotha.Verheyen 1967:64. In 1544 he wed Grafin Ottilia Schenk von Roßberg in Lyon. He moved to Nuremberg in 1546, where he was granted the city's freedom as a goldsmith in 1549. In 1556 he moved to Vienna, taking a house that still stands, now Bankgasse 12, and putting his antiquarian knowledge at the disposal of the Habsburg court, and rewarded with the care of the imperial treasury. He worked as architect to Ferdinand I in the ongoing construction of the Hofburg. In December 1566 he journeyed to Albrecht's court in Munich, to oversee the Antiquarium planned in conjunction and competition with Fugger, returning to Vienna in 1568. For Schloss Bučovice near Brünn he provided plans for the architect Jan Šember von Boskovic. For Schloss Neugebäude, begun from scratch (neu gebäude) as a hunting box by Maximilian II in 1568, no architect is reported in surviving documents, but its advanced integration with gardens makes Strada the most likely candidate; its construction, altered by numerous minute changes, abruptly came to an end with the Emperor's death in 1576.Schloss Neugebäude. The circumstances surrounding the making of the Titian portrait show Strada in a less favourable light. He visited Venice in 1567-68 to try and acquire for Albrecht the famous collection of art and antiquities left by Gabriele Vendramin (died 1552, and also now mainly remembered as the subject of a Titian portrait, the Portrait of the Vendramin Family). This entailed breaking the terms of Vendramin's will, and in the end the attempt failed. Another deal was hatched with Titian while the negotiations proceeded; Strada was to authenticate for the Emperor Maximilian studio repetitions of works that Titian had painted for Philip II of Spain as originals from the hand of the master himself. In return Titian was to paint Strada's portrait, and to receive a fur from him; perhaps the one that seems to be falling from his shoulders in the portrait. Knowledge of the deal comes from a letter to Fugger by Nicolò Stoppio, a Venetian dealer who was Strada's rival in Fugger's service; this claims Titian disliked Strada, and thought him a charlatan. Although the brilliant quality of the portrait has always been recognised, art historians agree the depiction of Strada is not flattering.Fletcher, Jennifer, 34 and 37, Jaffé, david, 168, both in David Jaffé (ed), Titian, The National Gallery Company/Yale, London 2003, The pose is taken from a tomb relief of about 1335 that Titian would have known, where a nobleman offers God his soul, represented as a naked baby. However, in his \\"expensive den\\",Jaffé, 168 Strada makes a very different offer to a client: \\"He manhandles a Venus, whose pudica gesture is wittily cancelled out by his hand clamped on her breast. As a shady character, he has an exceptionally heavy chiaroscuro on his face. His crowning achievement, his works on numismatics (a mixture of erudition and nonsense) are significantly placed above his head. His social ambition is emphasised by Titian's late decision to double the loops of his chain.\\"Fletcher, 37 The Antiquarium (begun 1568—71The design dated 1568 was discovered by Erich Hubala, \\"Ein Entwurf für das Antiquarium der Münchner Residenze 1568\\", Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, 9-10 (1958-59).) in the Munich Residenz He quit Albrecht's service about 1570. During 1571–1574 he compiled a catalogue of the surviving literature of Antiquity and compiled a lexicon. In 1574 his wife Ottilia died. At the end of the year, 27 December, he was accorded noble status. He demolished and rebuilt his dwelling, which housed his library of 3,000 volumes and his Kunstkammer.D.J. Jansen, \\"Jacopo Strada's antiquarian interests: a survey of his Musaeum and its purpose\\", Xenia 21 (1971:59-76. There he lived until his death, the honoured guest of the emperors. His Palais Strada stood as an eminent example of Late Renaissance architecture in the Simmering district of Vienna until it was demolished in 1875 in the rebuilding of the Wiener Burgtheater. In 1577 he published in Frankfurt-am-Main Sebastiano Serlio's seventh book of architecture,One of several being seen through the press at the time by his son Ottavio, according to a letter reported in Myra Nan Rosenfeld, \\"Sebastiano Serlio's Drawings in the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna for His Seventh Book on Architecture,\\" The Art Bulletin 56.3 (September 1974:400-409) p. 401. with its original Italian text, which exists in manuscript on parchment, and Strada's Latin translation.

After completing schooling in Ontario at Trinity College School and Upper Canada College, Merritt studied at Clifton College and the Royal School of Mines in England, where he received his A.R.S.M. (Associate of the Royal Society of Mines). Upon returning to Canada, he published pamphlets on mining and taught at the School of Mining in Kingston, Ontario. He was elected vice-president of the Ontario Mining Institute. Merritt also pursued a career as a soldier. In 1882 he joined the Governor-General's Bodyguard, where he was promoted quickly through the ranks. In 1903, he became lieutenant-colonel. Merritt served in the Northwest Rebellion and the Boer War, but by 1914 he was too old to serve in the First World War. He maintained an interest in military matters, though, and published a book, Canada and National Service, which advocated compulsory military service. The city of Merritt, British Columbia is named after William Hamilton Merritt III, due to his role in bringing the railway through the Nicola Valley. In 1890 he married Margaret Simpson, daughter of Toronto merchant Robert Simpson. In 1891, Merritt prospected for coal near where the city is today. Finding it, he organized the Nicola, Kamloops and Similkameen Coal and Railway Company to extend the rail line through to transport coal out of the valley. The railway also allowed settlement and industry to flourish in the valley. As demand for coal grew, the company was eventually bought by the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Career in the Railways Department Donne was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1859, son of William Donne and Rosa Bennett. He entered the New Zealand civil service in 1875 as a cadet in the Telegraph Department, Wellington and was soon transferred south. It was during his time in the Telegraph Department that he first met Joseph Ward who was to be a lifelong government colleague. Donne was subsequently transferred to the Railways Department and in 1876 he was appointed stationmaster and postmaster at Caversham before being promoted to similar positions in larger towns. In 1885 Donne suffered a serious accident in Gore when he was thrown beneath a train but recovered after 6 months. He bore the scars of this accident for the rest of his life. After his health returned Donne continued his steady rise through the ranks of the Railways Department and was appointed stationmaster of Wellington in 1885 and District Traffic Manager in 1894. In December 1900 Donne left the Railways Department to serve as the undersecretary in the Department of Industries and Commerce. Career in the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts Donne had an interest in encouraging tourism since his time in the Railways Department and was also appointed the General Manager of the newly created Department of Tourist and Health Resorts. This department was in the portfolio of the MP Joseph Ward. Donne proved to be an extremely able manager. He reviewed different areas of the country and encouraged the improvement of the accommodation network for tourists nationwide. He opened information bureaux in all of New Zealand's major cities. He encouraged the development of tourist attractions and businesses, most notably in Rotorua, improved the government owned spas and health resorts, and oversaw the establishment of the scenic reserve network. The health resorts owned by the Government, such as Rotorua, Hanmer Springs and Te Aroha, were transferred to the Department's control when it was created in 1901. Others were added or purchased during the following few years. By 1906 there were 17 reserves under control of the Department. Donne served as a member of the Scenery Preservation Board and the Tongariro National Park Board. In 1909 Dunne was also appointed the General Manager of the Government Advertising Department. Donne became heavily involved in promoting New Zealand trade and tourism at world and national fairs. In 1904 he was responsible for New Zealand's representation at the St Louis World's Fair exhibition. He organised a display to focus on the attractions of New Zealand for tourists and the work of his Department. The exhibit included paintings and photographs of the scenery, hunting and fishing trophies and Māori culture. He arranged for 10 portraits of significant Māori by Gottfried Lindauer to be borrowed from the Partridge Collection for exhibition at this fair. He extended the exhibit to ensure that New Zealand products were featured including examples of wood and kauri gum, grains, wool and flax hemp. From 1906 Donne served as the Vice-President and Executive Commissioner for the New Zealand International Exhibition. He traveled to the United States to encourage participation of overseas industry representatives at this Exhibition. He ensured that the Department of Tourist and Health Spa was well represented. The Department had its own court and concentrated on themes similar to those displayed at the St Louis World's Fair. The court included promotion of New Zealand's hunting and fishing through numerous deer heads and stuffed fish, examples of kauri gum and fine timber, and paintings. There was also a working replica of a Rotorua hot pool and geyser. Career at the High Commission, London In 1909 Donne was appointed to the position of Trade and Immigration Commissioner at the New Zealand High Commission in London. After his arrival in London in July 1909 Donne set to work investigating the possibility of using Bristol as a port for New Zealand goods. Donne continued promote New Zealand trade and tourism in exhibitions during his time in the New Zealand High Commission. He contributed to New Zealand's presence at the Imperial International Exhibition, London in 1909; the International Sports Fair in Vienna, 1910; and was the Chairman of the committee organising the New Zealand section of the pageant in the Festival of Empire in 1911. Donne ensured that the New Zealand pavilion at the Festival of Empire featured a Māori village and invited a Māori concert group from Te Arawa to London for the festival. The group featured the well-known guide from Rotorua, Guide Maggie Papakura. Donne served as the Trade and Immigration Commissioner until 1916 when he was appointed to the position of Secretary to the High Commissioner for New Zealand until his retirement from government service in 1923. After his retirement Donne remained in the United Kingdom. He assisted with supplying material to the New Zealand court at the British Empire Exhibition. Personal life Donne married Amy Kate Lucas in 1883. They had three sons - Cecil Lucas Donne (b. 1884), Basil Lucas Donne (b. 1885 -d.1945), and Lester Edward Lucas Donne (b. 1895). Donne was an extremely keen hunter and recreational fisherman. He was particularly fond of deer hunting and amassed a large collection of trophy heads. His interest in hunting was influential on the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts. During his time as General Manager the Department arranged the importation and release in New Zealand of different species of game animals including Canada geese, red deer, wapiti, salmon, chamois and thar (the usual New Zealand spelling). It was while hunting that he found a complete skeleton of a Moa which he donated to the Dominion Museum. Collecting He was also a collector of Māori antiquities and New Zealand fine art. His interest in Māori matters led him to record his findings and articles of interest in scrapbooks. When he left New Zealand for London he took some of his collection with him but the remainder was sold at auction on 18 and 19 May 1909 by H.J. Bethune & Co. When in London he continued to develop his collection and corresponded, purchased and swapped artifacts, works on paper and artworks with numerous other collectors including Horatio Gordon Robley,; Kenneth Athol Webster; and Alfred Walter Francis Fuller. One of the prime pieces in his collection was a small carved house named Te Wharepuni-a-Maui. He had commissioned this house to be carved for him in 1905 by the carvers Tene Waitere, Neke Kapua and Eramiha Neke Kapua. Te Wharepuni-a-Maui was first situated at the Whakarewarewa model village in Rotorua before being rented to the New Zealand International Exhibition. Donne took this house with him when he left New Zealand and it is likely to have also been included in other exhibitions he contributed to as a staff member of the New Zealand High Commission. This house is now in the collection of Linden Museum. Another significant collection he was associated with was a collection of New Zealand jade. This collection began with the New Zealand collector John White. On White's death in 1904 the collection of jade was sold to an Englishman named J. Struan Robertson who was touring New Zealand. It was shipped to England but only unpacked after the death of Robertson in 1912. The collection was offered for sale to museums by his daughter but only selected pieces were purchased by the British Museum, Bristol Museum, the Pitt-Rivers Museum and Devizes Museum. The rest of the collection was purchased by Donne. Donne split the collection and retained the hei tiki, pendants and other special pieces. He sold the remainder to the Field Museum. Donne later sold the pieces he retained to Armytage. On the death of Armytage, Kenneth Athol Webster ensured that the Armytage collection of jade was repatriated to New Zealand museums. Donne donated, sold or auctioned parts of his collection throughout his life and items that had been owned by him can be found in: *the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa *the collection of the Alexander Turnbull Library *the collection of the Field Museum *the collection of the Linden Museum Writing Donne wrote a number of books including: *New Zealand Government catalogue of exhibits at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904, St. Louis, Missouri, Published 1904 by Little & Becker, St Louis. *New Zealand : a fairyland of boiling fountains, vast glaciers, painted Maori and wingless birds, Published 1905 *The game animals of New Zealand : an account of their introduction, acclimatization, and development, Published 1924 by John Murray, London. *Red deer stalking in New Zealand, Published 1924 by Constable & Company, London. *The Maori past and present : an account of a highly attractive, intelligent people, their doubtful origin, their customs and ways of living, art, methods of warfare, hunting and other characteristics mental and physical, Published 1927 by Seeley Service, London.

Recognition Donne was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1923 King's Birthday Honours. He had a number of geological features in New Zealand named after him including Donne River, which flows from the Donne Glacier. There is also a mountain, Mount Amy, named after his wife.

Mann, who was an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. The demand was issued under the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act in connection with claims by Cuccinnelli that Mann had possibly violated state fraud laws in relation to five research grants, by allegedly manipulating data. No evidence of wrongdoing was presented to support the claim. Mann's earlier work had been targeted by climate change deniers attacking the hockey stick graph, and allegations against him were renewed in late 2009 in the Climatic Research Unit email controversy but found to be groundless in a series of investigations. Widespread concerns were raised by University of Virginia's faculty and numerous scientists and science organizations that Cuccinelli's actions posed a threat to academic freedom, and would have a chilling effect on research in the state. The university filed a court petition and the judge dismissed Cuccinelli's demand on the grounds that no justification had been shown for the investigation. Cuccinelli tried to re-open his case by issuing a revised subpoena, and appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. The case was defended by the university, and the court ruled that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The outcome was seen as a victory for academic freedom. Background While an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Michael E. Mann co- authored with Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes two reconstructions of the past temperatures in the northern hemisphere: MBH98 and MBH99. The latter extended back 1,000 years and was nicknamed the \\"hockey stick graph\\". In 1999 Mann joined the University of Virginia as an assistant professor. A version of MBH99 featured prominently in the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report, and attacks on the graph by those opposing action on global warming became politically prominent. The validity of the research was confirmed by the National Academy of Sciences. In 2005 Mann moved on to a position as an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University. The Climatic Research Unit email controversy which began in November 2009 brought renewed scrutiny, and allegations of scientific malpractice. An investigation by Pennsylvania State University determined on 3 February 2010 that there was no evidence of misconduct by Mann.\\"Oxburgh Report Clears Controversial Climate Research Unit\\" (Science Magazine, April 14, 2010) In January 2010, Ken Cuccinelli took office as Virginia's elected Attorney General. He is a conservative Republican party politician who alleges that the evidence of global warming has been skewed by scientists. The following month he filed suit seeking to overturn a finding of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Civil Investigative Demand Cuccinelli's office served a formal Civil Investigative Demand (CID) on the University of Virginia on 23 April 2010, requiring the university to produce information and documentary materials by 27 May 2010.Office of the Attorney General of Virginia, Civil Investigative Demand CID No. 2-MM, issued 23 April 2010 The civil investigative demand was equivalent to a subpoena but did not require the Attorney General to file a lawsuit or to obtain the intervention or permission of a court so that he could make the demand. The CID referred to an investigation by the Attorney General into \\"possible violations\\" by Mann of the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (FATA). Information required related to Mann having sought grants funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and any data or communications Mann had made in connection with five named grants for scientific research. The university was instructed to produce documents dating from January 1999 to the present, including all emailed or written correspondence from, to or relating to Mann and 39 named climate scientists as well as research assistants, secretaries and administrative staff, anything connected with applications for the grants or payment of the grants, and all \\"documents, drafts, things or data\\" generated in carrying out the grant assisted research. They also required all \\"computer algorithms, programs, source code or the like\\" created or edited by Mann and stored by the university. Where documents were no longer held by the university, the CID required details of who had destroyed or removed them, and their authority for doing so. On May 4 Cuccinelli described the request as part of an \\"open inquiry\\" into whether Mann had made \\"knowing inconsistencies\\" when applying for research funding. Cuccinelli said, \\"In light of the Climategate e-mails, there does seem to at least be an argument to be made that a course was undertaken by some of the individuals involved, including potentially Michael Mann, where they were steering a course to reach a conclusion\\". He added, \\"Our act, frankly, just requires honesty.\\" The following day he said, \\"We aren't targeting scientific conclusions. That's not the issue. It's the expenditure of taxpayer dollars.\\" The university responded on 5 May with a position statement which noted that four of the five named research grants were from federal organisations outside Virginia. The CID referred to FATA provisions on financial fraud, but Cuccinelli's comments in The Washington Post and the unusual nature of the CID \\"strongly suggest that the investigation is motivated primarily by differences of opinion regarding the scientific basis for current understanding of climate change.\\" They considered his actions inappropriate in scientific inquiry; \\"His action and the potential threat of legal prosecution of scientific endeavor that has satisfied peer-review standards send a chilling message to scientists engaged in basic research involving Earth’s climate and indeed to scholars in any discipline. Such actions directly threaten academic freedom and, thus, our ability to generate the knowledge upon which informed public policy relies.\\"  Initial public reaction  Academics and scientists said that Cuccinelli's demand threatened academic freedom. Mann said that he believed that Cuccinelli was \\"simply trying to smear me as part of a larger campaign to discredit my science\\". Nineteen professors at Virginia's Old Dominion University issued a statement saying that Cuccinelli's actions \\"echo some of the worst offenses of the McCarthy era\\", alluding to the anti-Communist investigations of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. They demanded that he \\"cease and desist from this and further 'witch hunts' driven by partisan political agendas that waste valuable state resources in a difficult economy.\\" U.Va.'s Faculty Senate issued a statement criticizing the investigation as being politically motivated and \\"an inappropriate way to engage with the process of scientific inquiry\\" which \\"directly threaten[s] academic freedom\\" by \\"send[ing] a chilling message to scientists engaged in basic research involving Earth's climate and indeed to scholars in any discipline.\\" More than 800 state university and college faculty members signed a petition organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which said in a statement: \\"Much of Virginia's scientific and academic community is appalled that their attorney general has launched such a blatantly political investigation.\\" The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the American Association of University Professors also criticized Cuccinelli's actions, commenting in a joint letter that \\"it is hard to conceive of the Attorney General's request ... as anything but a \\"fishing expedition\\" aimed at discrediting Dr. Mann's conclusions, rather than pursuing any reasonable suspicions of malfeasance.\\" A statement by the directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science said that \\"scientists should not be subjected to fraud investigations simply for providing scientific results that may be controversial or inconvenient\\" and that investigations such as those Cuccinelli has initiated against Mann \\"could have a long-lasting and chilling effect on a broad spectrum of research fields that are critical to a range of national interests from public health to national security to the environment.\\" The science journal Nature published an editorial describing the investigation as \\"an ideologically motivated inquisition that harasses and intimidates climate scientists\\". Chip Knappenberger, assistant to global warming denier Patrick Michaels, said just as he \\"didn't like it when the politicians came after Pat Michaels,\\" he \\"[doesn't] like it that the politicians are coming after Mike Mann.\\" The Washington Post' said in an editorial that Cuccinelli had \\"declared war on the freedom of academic inquiry\\" and that he had demonstrated \\"a dangerous disregard for scientific method and academic freedom.\\" In a subsequent editorial the newspaper applauded U.Va's decision to resist the demand and highlighted the potential cost of the precedent being set by Cuccinelli, noting that \\"if researchers at state institutions are unwilling to stick their necks out in case a state official dislikes their findings, scientific progress at the commonwealth's universities will screech to a halt, talented faculty will leave, and the best and brightest students will go elsewhere.\\"  Litigation involving original Civil Investigative Demand  Many scientists urged the university to resist. On 27 May U.Va. filed a petition with Albemarle County Circuit Court asking a judge to dismiss Cuccinelli's demand. The university argued that Cuccinelli had issued a vague, non-specific demand that exceeded his statutory authority: \\"Investigating the merits of a university researcher's methodology, results and conclusions (on climate change or any topic) goes far beyond the Attorney General's limited statutory power\\". The petition connected Cuccinelli's actions with his ongoing litigation about federal environmental policy and regulation. It argued in a subsequent brief that the demand was \\"fundamentally legally flawed\\". Cuccinelli filed a brief in response on 11 June asserting that he had a right to demand climate change records, arguing that \\"neither academic freedom nor the First Amendment have ever been held to immunize a person, whether an academic or not, from civil or criminal actions for fraud, let alone immunized them from an otherwise authorized investigation.\\" The Union of Concerned Scientists noted that the brief based its arguments on emails from the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, but said it misrepresented emails and took them out of context. Shortly afterwards, Penn State university Investigatory Inquiry announced that it had unanimously \\"determined that there is no substance\\" to the allegations against Mann. A follow-up brief filed on 13 July again asserted Cuccinelli's authority and questioned Mann's scientific findings, asserting that Mann and other scientists had manipulated scientific conclusions to produce results that could be used to support the regulation of carbon dioxide. The Union of Concerned Scientists described it as making basic errors based on claims taken out of context. U.Va. responded by questioning Cuccinelli's motives, stating that his demand was \\"aimed squarely at Dr. Mann's scientific conclusions\\" and that more than a third of the attorney general's brief \\"is devoted to challenging and criticizing the research and conclusions of Dr. Mann and his co-authors.\\" The University argued that given the importance of protecting academic freedom the court should not permit the attorney general to exceed his statutory power, and that \\"such a potentially invasive investigative tool should not be permitted to be used to target academics merely because the Attorney General disputes the legitimacy of their research and conclusions.\\" It noted that four of the grants queried by Cuccinelli were received from the federal government and were therefore not covered by the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, while the fifth was awarded before the statute was enacted in 2003. U.Va. argued that much of the information demanded by Cuccinelli had nothing to do with any of the five grants and was \\"not even remotely tailored to an investigation of a potential [fraud statute] investigation.\\" The presiding judge, Cheryl V. Higgins, agreed to stay Cuccinelli's demand pending further oral hearings due to take place in late August. On August 20, 2010, Albermarle Circuit Court Judge Paul Peatross heard argument on when Cuccinelli should get the requested data, including emails between Mann and his research assistants, secretaries and 39 other scientists across the country. In the court's ruling issued on August 30, 2010, the judge concluded that the university was a proper subject for a Civil Investigative Demand which could investigate \\"grants made with Commonwealth of Virginia funds to professors such as Dr. Mann\\", but not the federal grants. However, the demands did not show \\"reason to believe\\" that the university held relevant material, or meet the statute requirements to state \\"the nature of the conduct\\" so that \\"any reasonable person could glean what Dr. Mann did to violate the statute\\". The court completely rejected the demands, but left it open for the \\"Commonwealth to proceed according to the law\\".Ruling. Retrieved 2010-08-31. At this point, Cuccinelli could either rewrite the civil investigative demand or appeal the decision.http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2010/aug/30/judge-sides-uva- climate-case-dismissing-cuccinelli-ar-479678/ Mann called the ruling a victory \\"for all scientists who live in fear that they may be subject to a motivated witch hunt when their research findings prove inconvenient to powerful vested interests.\\"  Second Civil Investigative Demand  On September 29, 2010, Cuccinelli filed a revised CID in order to address some of the shortcomings identified in the August 30 ruling. The main changes were narrowing the case to the only one of the five original grants which was not a federal grant and stating the specific allegation of fraud: he referred to the Mann, Bradley and Hughes 1998 and 1998 \\"hockey stick\\" hemispheric climate reconstructions (MBH98 and MBH99), and said \\"Specifically, but without limitation, some of the conclusions of the papers demonstrate a complete lack of rigor regarding the statistical analysis of the alleged data, meaning that the result reported lacked statistical significance without a specific statement to that effect.\\" Mann noted that the grant concerned was for research into the interaction between the atmosphere and vegetation in the African savannah, and did not relate to climate reconstructions. The University of Virginia announced that it would fight the request, and stated that resisting the Attorney General's demands had already cost it $350,000 in legal fees, paid from private funds. On October 20, 2010, the University of Virginia filed papers requesting that Cuccinelli’s latest demand be “set aside” as well. UVa’s lawyers pointed out that Cuccinelli’s latest CID recites verbatim the first 15 pages of the attorney general’s brief in opposition to UVa’s petition to dismiss the previous CIDs. They stated that the text had already been considered by the court and “found deficient.”  Virginia Supreme Court Ruling  In March, 2011, the Supreme Court of Virginia decided to hear Cuccinelli's appeal. Both sides were expected to file legal briefs outlining their cases in the spring, and a hearing was to be held at some point after those documents were received. On 2 March 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that Cuccinelli as Attorney General had no legal authority to demand the records from the university. Mann expressed pleasure at the outcome, but stated that \\"It's sad that so much money and resources had to be wasted on Cuccinelli's witch hunt against me and the University of Virginia, when it could have been invested, for example, in measures to protect Virginia's coastline from the damaging effects of sea- level rise it is already seeing.\\" The Union of Concerned Scientists applauded the reconfirmation that the demands lacked legal standing, and said that \\"Academic institutions have the responsibility to protect their faculty's ability to discover new things about our world without fearing harassment. Nobody should expect the rough drafts of their work to be subject to the same level of scrutiny as their published research.\\" The Attorney General's office put out a statement that \\"From the beginning, we have said that we were simply trying to review documents that are unquestionably state property to determine whether or not fraud had been committed. Today, the court effectively held that state agencies do not have to provide state-owned property to state investigators looking into potential fraud involving government funds.\\"  External links  = University of Virginia = * Petition To Set Aside Civil Investigative Demands Issued to the University of Virginia, May 27, 2010 * Brief in Support of Petition to Set Aside Civil Investigative Demands Issued to the University of Virginia, June 29, 2010 * Exhibits to Brief in Support of Petition to Set Aside Civil Investigative Demands, June 29, 2010 * Reply Brief in Support of Petition to Set Aside Civil Investigative Demands Issued to the University of Virginia, July 20, 2010 = Attorney General of Virginia = * Answer to University of Virginia Petition, June 11, 2010 * Brief in Opposition to Petition, July 13, 2010 = Court Decisions = * Order setting aside the CID 30 August 2010 * Supreme Court of Virginia opinion affirming the judgment of the circuit court and setting aside the CIDs with prejudice; March 2, 2012  References  * This article contains material copied from Ken Cuccinelli.

Maximus Musicus is an Icelandic children's franchise, including books, CDs, DVDs and family concert programs, aimed at introducing symphonic music to children. The story and part of the music was written by Hallfríður Ólafsdóttir, principal flautist of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra. The books are illustrated by Þórarinn Már Baldursson, a violist in the ISO. Conductor and pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy is the program's patron.  Books  The first book introduces Maximus, a mouse that finds his way into a concert hall, and enjoys many adventures as he explores the world of the symphonic orchestra rehearsing there. It was first published in Iceland in 2008 along with an audio CD. The second book of the series tells of Maximus exploring a school of music. It was published in 2010 along with an audio CD. Concerts Each story of Maximus is designed to be performed by a full symphonic orchestra, a narrator and silent actor playing the part of Maximus. Accompanying the performance are illustrations from the books, projected to an onstage screen. The story is told to an abridged Boléro, the first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth and Copland’s Fanfare for the Common Man as well as Maxi’s Song, composed by author Hallfríður, and the Icelandic all-time favourite “Á Sprengisandi” by Sigvaldi Kaldalóns. Reception Maximus Musicus became very popular upon introduction in Iceland in 2008 and was both financially and critically successful for both authors and the ISO, as the family-concerts were uniformly sold out. The second installment became no less of a success on its release in 2010. Maximus Musicus has gained international attention as the program has been translated from the Icelandic into English, German, Dutch, Portuguese (Brasil) and Korean. The series is published domestically by Forlagið and internationally by Schott. The concert program has been performed live in Iceland, the Netherlands, Germany, the US and Australia.

Vanderbei (born 1955) is an American mathematician and Professor in the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University. Biography Robert J. Vanderbei was born in Grand Rapids, MI, in 1955. He received his BS in Chemistry in 1976 and an MS in Operations Research and Statistics in 1978 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and his PhD in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University in 1981. In his thesis,Vanderbei, R.J.: Toward a Stochastic Calculus for Several Markov Processes, PhD. Thesis, Cornell University, May 1981. he developed probabilistic potential theory for random fields consisting of tensor products of Brownian motions. He was postdoctoral research fellow at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and then at the Mathematics Department at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. In 1984, he left academia and joined Bell Labs, where he served as a team member of AT&T;'s Advanced Decision Support Systems venture. In 1990, Vanderbei returned to academia to teach at Princeton University. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE). In addition to his appointment in ORFE, he also has courtesy appointments in Mathematics, Astrophysics, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics. He is also a member of the Bendheim Center for Finance. Research =Mathematical programming= Vanderbei’s arrival at Bell Labs coincided with Narendra Karmarkar’s discovery of a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. In May 1985, he became the first nonmanagement team member of AT&T;'s Advanced Decision Support Systems venture, where he served as the interface to Karmarkar and as the lead developer of the first release of the linear programming software. In 1985, Vanderbei, with Bell Labs colleagues Marc Meketon and Barry Freedman, wrote a paper proving convergence of a variant of Karmarkar's algorithm that became known as the Affine-Scaling algorithm.Vanderbei, R.J.; Meketon, M.S.; Freedman, B.A.: A modification of Karmarkar's linear programming algorithm, Algorithmica, 1:395–407, 1986. Eventually it became known that I.I. Dikin, working in Siberia and publishing in Russian, had proved convergence of the same algorithm under weaker nondegeneracy assumptions many years earlier.Dikin, I.I.: Iterative solution of problems of linear and quadratic programming, Soviet Mathematics - Doklady, 8:674–675, 1967. Vanderbei, both individually and with Meketon, and Freedman was awarded US Patents for his theoretical and practical work on the affine-scaling algorithm.Vanderbei, R.J.: Methods and Apparatus for Efficient Resource Allocation, U.S. Patent Number 4,744,026. Extension of Karmarkar algorithm to handle linear programming problems with free variables, May 1988.Vanderbei, R.J.: Methods and Apparatus for Efficient Resource Allocation, U.S. Patent Number 4,885,686. Extension of Karmarkar algorithm to handle linear programming problems with dense columns, December 1988.Freedman, B.A.; Meketon, M.S.; Vanderbei, R.J.: Methods and Apparatus for Efficient Resource Allocation, U.S. Patent Number 4,924,386. Extension of Karmarkar algorithm to handle linear programming problems with nonzero lower bounds and finite upper bounds, May 1990. Taken together with the three patents awarded to Karmarkar, this suite of patents represented the first awarded for what was considered pure mathematics. At the time, they generated loud objections Dantzig, G.B.; Goldfarb, D; Lawler, E; Monma, C; Robinson, S.M.: Report of the Committee on Algorithms and the Law, Optima, 33:1–19, June 1991. from other researchers in optimization algorithms. In 1987, Vanderbei left the development team and moved to the Bell Labs' Math Research Center in Murray Hill, NJ. In 1990, he returned to academia to teach at Princeton University. Throughout the 1990s Vanderbei's research governed the development of interior-point solvers. In 1993, Helmberg, Rendl, Vanderbei, and Wolkowicz developed an interior-point algorithm for semidefinite programming.Helmberg, C; Rendl, F.; Vanderbei, R.J.; Wolkowicz, H.: An interior point method for semidefinite programming, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 6:342–361, 1996. Vanderbei later developed algorithms for quadratic problems, convex, and finally nonlinear optimization problems.Vanderbei, R.J.: LOQO: An interior point code for quadratic programming, Optimization Methods and Software, 12:451–484, 1999.Vanderbei, R.J.; Shanno, D.F.: An Interior-Point Algorithm for Nonconvex Nonlinear Programming, Computational Optimization and Applications, 13:231–252, 1999. Vanderbei is the author of a textbook on linear programmingVanderbei, R.J.: Linear Programming: Foundations and Extensions, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 3rd edition, 2007. and a software package for nonlinear programming called LOQO. =Purple America= Vanderbei received widespread attention for something that was only intended to be an exercise for the freshman computer programming course. The US News and World Report magazine, among other media outlets, reprinted his so-called Purple America map, which he made after the 2000 US Presidential election (and then subsequent national elections) to depict on a county-by-county level how the elections turned out. =Recent research interests= Since 2001, most of Vanderbei's research has been devoted to developing high-contrast imaging systems with the eventual aim of direct imaging of exoplanets. The concepts he has contributed to include shaped-pupil coronagraphs, PIAA-style pupil mapping coronagraphs, and space- based external occulters. Together with J. Richard Gott, Vanderbei is the author of a National Geographic book called Sizing Up The Universe (Book website). Other interests Vanderbei also was a serious glider pilot for many years. From 1988 to 1999 he was chief flight instructor for the Central Jersey Soaring Club. In 1999, he retired from soaring and took up the hobby of astrophotography. He regularly posts new astroimages on his astro gallery website. Awards and honors He was elected to the 2006 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. In 2013 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, for \\"contributions to linear programming and nonlinear optimization problems\\".2014 Class of the Fellows of the AMS, American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2014-08-12.

The band would be put under such banners as ネオアコースティック (\\"Neo-Acoustic\\") in Japan (see below), which refers to the sound heavily influenced by the British independent music scene of the 1980s, most notably alternative rock. ネオアコ (\\"Neo-Aco\\"), as often dubbed, was popular with the country's young generations in the 1990s.:ja:ネオアコ The band's name comes from a poem written by Richard Brautigan, in which he compared roadside drunks to exotic flowers. This led to the name \\"Brautigan Flower\\", which eventually became \\"b-flower\\". b-flower's work often contains references to Brautigan's writing. \\"Even NME, not the easiest to please, no doubt, praised their tunes and performance full of sensitive beauty.

History They first came to critical attention in Japan in 1990 when their self-produced debut EP, 『日曜日のミツバチ (Nichiyo-bi no Mitsubachi)』(\\"Nothing On Sunday\\") came out. Two full-length albums and another EP later, they contributed two tracks to \\"The Birth of The True,\\" a compilation album featuring a number of then hopeful British and Japanese indie pop bands, which was released in the U.K. in March 1992 by Sugarfrost Records from Liverpool in tandem with ¡Por supuesto! Records, their Japanese counterpart, and played on the air and praised by John Peel in May. The band's two contributions, the only tracks sung in Japanese in the entire album, found surprisingly warm critical reception, represented by \\"the best of all\\" from NME and Melody Maker in their August issues. Following that the band released two 7\\" vinyl singles, \\"Stay Still\\" in 1993 and \\"Strings\\" in 1994, via the independent English label. Both were performed entirely in Japanese, yet enjoyed critical acclaim from the afore-mentioned two reviews (as quoted above). Back in Japan, Toshiba EMI began releasing their work, a total of five albums, including their eponymous album in 1998. Around 2000 the band stopped releasing albums even though there were releases from some of the members in 1999 and 2000. After a 10-year hiatus, in November 2010 frontman Hachino and drummer Okabe released a debut single, \\"Tokyo, Snowscape\\" under a moniker of Livingstone Daisy, joined by ambient musician Hosomi Sakana. \\"This World of Sorrow\\" was their second release in February, followed by \\"June Song\\" in September, with debut album \\"33 Minutes Before the Light\\" released in March 2013. In May 2012 the band ended their decade-long 'hibernation' by digitally releasing a brand new single, \\"After All This Time\\", whose original Japanese title is 『つまらない大人になってしまった (Tsumaranai Otona ni Natte Shimatta)』(\\"I've Become a Boring Adult\\").

Her uncle William Heath Davis (1822–1909) moved to Alta California in the 1830s. After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, King was made minister of the interior for the Provisional Government of Hawaii on January 17, 1893. He also served as minister of Interior of the Republic of Hawaii until his death. On June 3, 1896 he acted as minister of finance until the end of the month when he was replaced by Henry E. Cooper. King died October 16, 1899, while trying to teach his six- year-old son how to swim in the ocean. He had an elaborate state funeral at ʻIolani Palace (then known as the executive building) with burial at Oahu Cemetery with Masonic rituals of Freemasonry on October 23, 1899. His son Samuel Wilder King became governor of the Territory of Hawaii.

He apprenticed in Anjou, France, and at twenty moved to the United States to work at several fine restaurants. He became the chef/owner of Rover's Restaurant in 1987, and before closing its doors in 2013 it helped make him one of the most recognizable chefs around Seattle. Rautureau has won various awards including the James Beard Award for Best Chef in the Pacific Northwest in 1998, and has been awarded the Chevalier de l’Ordre Du Mérite Agricole by the French government. In 2010, Rautureau opened Luc, a French-American café and bar in Madison Valley.

He has cooked for such well-known figures as Hillary Clinton, Francis Ford Coppola, Jackson Browne, and Julia Child. Early life Rautureau was raised in the town of Saint Hilaire de Loulay in the Muscadet region of France. Thierry Rautureau hails from the town of Saint Hilaire de Loulay in the Muscadet region of France. His parents were farmers in a small agricultural community where the cows and chickens outnumbered the people. The family cooked only what they grew, thus providing a purely seasonal diet. As the oldest child, Rautureau was given the chore of doing the prep for dinner; and as such he quickly became acquainted with fresh homegrown ingredients at a young age.\\"The Story of the Chef in the Hat.\\" The Chef in the Hat. 2010. Web Early career At fourteen, Rautureau started a cooking apprenticeship in Anjou, France and at sixteen went on a Regional Tour de France and trained in the cities of Le Mont Saint Michel in Normandy, Chamonix in the French Alps, and Hendaye in the Pays Basque.

Facts The Imperial Tobacco pension trust committee asked the court whether the wording of rule 64A of the pension scheme could be varied with the company management’s consent. This said that members’ benefits ‘shall be increased by at least the lesser of’ 5% pa or the Retail Price Index. That provision was introduced following an amendment under rule 36 that said the committee could make amendment following the company management’s consent. Imperial Tobacco had been taken over by Hanson Trust plc, and the rule 64A was introduced as an apparent poison pill, because the previous position was that employees’ pensions were only updated ad hoc and usually below inflation. This accompanied the automatic closure of the existing scheme to new entrants. But the takeover succeeded in 1986. By then, inflation had increased above 5%, and so the committee asked management if they would update pensions over 5%. The new management refused, and offered instead a new scheme of the lesser of 15% pa or RPI updates. Employees holding entitlements to the old scheme, if they transferred would take their aliquot share, including surpluses (there was an estimated £130m at the time). However, the catch in the new scheme was that any surplus would go to the company, not the employees’ themselves. The trust alleged that, if the committee did have to obtain management’s consent to update the entitlements to keep pace with inflation, the offer given was a breach a duty of good faith because it was compelling employees to forgo their acquired rights. Judgment Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC held that rule 64A could not be construed as allowing the committee to make increases without management’s consent. However, the company management could not use its discretion to withhold its consent in a way that undermined good faith, and mutual trust and confidence. The company management was not exercising a fiduciary power, and so it could take its own interests, including financial burdens, into account, but it still had to exercise its power for a proper purpose. A collateral purpose of coercing members to relinquish their accrued rights for the company to benefit from the surplus, was bad faith. His judgment on the nature of the pension obligations read as follows.[1991] 1 WLR 589, 597-598 See also *UK company law *English trust law *The Achilleas *Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.

O.A. and Antinom formed Vasaeleth due to their desires to work with atmospheres and themes not found in their respective other projects. As O.A. and Antinom, who always answer interviews collectively, explained, On April 17, 2009 Vasaeleth released a two-track cassette demo titled Demo MMIX, which was released through Satanic Skinhead Propaganda in a limited edition of 200 hand-numbered copies. The demo featured the songs \\"Figures of Chained Spirits\\" and \\"Adorned and Iridescent\\". These were the first two songs that O.A. and Antinom recorded as a band and were meant to stand as a sort of \\"mission statement\\" for Vasaeleth. Originally, O.A. and Antinom had intended on releasing the demo themselves, but, upon hearing it, Satanic Skinhead Propaganda decided to release it. The reaction to the demo was described by O.A. and Antinom as \\"overwhelmingly positive\\", as they noted that it sold out in six days. When asked whether the Vasaeleth supported the right-wing views espoused by Satantic Skinhead Propaganda, O.A. and Antinom replied that Vasaeleth then released the Adorned & Iridescent 7\\" EP, which consisted of the two Demo MMIX songs plus one exclusive track, \\"Unmanifest\\". Adorned & Iridescent was released on 9 January 2010 by Satanic Skinhead Propaganda and Blood Harvest Records. Vasaeleth completed work on its full-length debut studio album Crypt Born & Tethered to Ruin in December 2009. Meanwhile, Vasaeleth was signed by Profound Lore Records and arranged for Colin Marston to master the recording. Crypt Born & Tethered to Ruin was released on February 16, 2010 through Profound Lore. In 2013, Vasaeleth released the All Uproarious Darkness EP, again on Profound Lore Records.

It differs from the other usual rankings (general classification, points, king of the mountain and best young rider competition) in the sense that it awards the effort of a whole team, rather than the performance of the individual riders. Examples include: * Team classification in the Giro d'Italia; awarded since the race's inception. In more recent editions the classification is calculated by adding up the top three riders' times from each team, and then the team with the lowest total time is the leader of the classification. In case of a tie, the teams are separated by the sum of the places obtained by their three best riders at the finish. * Team classification in the Tour de France; awarded since 1930, and the calculation has changed throughout the years. As of 2011, it is calculated by adding the times of the three best riders of each team per stage; time bonuses and penalties are ignored. In a team time trial, the team gets the time of the fifth rider of that team to cross the finish, or the last rider if there are fewer than 5 left for the team. If a team has fewer than three cyclists remaining, it is removed from this classification. * Team classification in the Vuelta a España; awarded since its inception in 1935. Status The team classification is considered less important than the individual general classification, and it is rare that a team starts one of the major cycling events with the main goal of winning the team classification. Although this is also subject to cultural preference as well, as Spanish teams are for instance well known for taking great interest in winning the team classification. If during the race a team is in a good position to win the team classification, the team may change tactics in order to win. When Lance Armstrong lost hopes of winning the 2010 Tour de France, he instructed his team mates to keep an eye on their main rivals for the team classification, and his Team RadioShack won the team classification for that event. In some races, a good performance in the team classification may help a team to qualify for the next event. In 2010, a system was set up to determine which teams qualify as UCI ProTeams in the Tour de France, and the team classification in the Tour de France was part of this system.

Her musical talent was noticed very young and she would find any opportunity to write, play, sing and dance for everyone as well as picking up a lot of other instruments in the orchestra. Prior to starting her solo career, she studied at Environmental Art at Glasgow School of Art and Dance and Drama at Performance College. Wensdy released her debut single in May 2010. In 2010, she released three studio singles in quick succession: \\"The Puppet\\", \\"MyB.O.D.Y\\" and \\"GONNA GET IT\\". All songs received positive feedback from the media and public and played on over 60 worldwide radio stations from their release date, in early 2010. Wensdy assumes creative control over all of her work from the production, rhythm, style and accompanying artwork. Wensdy cites her primary musical influence as The Black Eyed Peas. The name Wensdy is Australian slang for Wednesday,Wensdy, Slang- dictionary.org Sophia chose this stage name for a number of reasons including the claimed date of the end of the world, 12 December 2012,Jean-Claude Koven Will the World Really End on 12 December 2012 landing on a Wednesday. Early years Born in Lenzie, Scotland, her parents divorced when Wensdy was two years old. Wensdy began developing musical interest early in her life. She began singing at the age of four years.Mearns FM Radio Interview on Youtube 8 June 2010 At age four, Wensdy attended dance classes and would often stand on chairs and sing and dance at home. Her enthusiasm for music and art was not entirely understood because her family was serious and believed in working class ethic. However Wensdy would continue to write songs and poems for her family and friends on into adulthood. She listened to artists like Michael Jackson and Handel and sing and dance at her grandmothers house regularly, singing anything from \\"Beat It\\", \\"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\\", \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\" for her aunts and uncles. In addition to this Wensdy went to her father's house most weekends and there she would spend the entire Friday evening in his music studio. Wensdy’s father was a business man but he had aspirations of being a performer when he was in his 20s. He would host Friday night jam sessions for his friends. Wensdy explains that this was a time when she was very happy and sometimes she could even get up and sing in the studio which she found really exciting. Around the age of 15, Wensdy’s mother parted from her live-in partner and this was set to greatly affect Wensdy’s life. Her mother took to drinking heavily and, by the age of 16, Wensdy was thrown out into the streets of Glasgow without even a pair of shoes. This was a turning point as Wensdy could yet again focus on her music and art and she shortly after pursued a Portfolio preparation course and got accepted into Glasgow School of Art. Here she was to meet many great friends, however she did not complete the course as she felt it lacked real direction. She had great drive and ambition to succeed and felt that Art School was not bringing all of her dreams into reality. After several Art ExhibitionsArtesian Gallery Participated in Group show \\"Out of the Ashes\\" and a stint at Performance College Wensdy began to write and produce her own style of music. 2010 Wensdy's debut single as a solo artist was \\"The Puppet\\" which has received positive feedback. \\"The Puppet\\" was originally titled \\"The Big Game\\" and was written over an eight-month period and re-written and re-titled approaching the UK 2010 general election.Big Tommys BFPA Pre-Recorded Interview @ YouTube \\"GONNA GET IT\\" was written by Wensdy over a 2-week period for the 2010 South African World CupMearns FM Interview Youtube (part 2) 8 June 2010 and was released on 11 June.

Sloane's career trajectory was unusual in that for most of her professional life she was essentially an anonymous bit part actress, and her best, most substantial roles did not come until relatively late in her career when she was in her 50s. Her most famous film appearance is the 1950 production Seven Days to Noon. Career =1920s-1940s= Born in London in 1896, Sloane's first screen credit came in a 1921 silent film The Door That Has No Key produced by Frank Hall Crane, and there were five further appearances in silents up to 1925, including 1922's Trapped by the Mormons, a film which many decades later became a cult favourite with midnight film aficionados due to its unintentionally ludicrous hilarity, and received a DVD release in the US in 2006. After 1925, there would be no further film appearance for Sloane until after the advent of talkies with 1933's The Good Companions. Details of Sloane's activities in the intervening years are sparse, but information retrieved places her working with a touring stage company in New Zealand in 1927.\\"The Show's the Thing\\" NZ Truth, 17 November 1927. Retrieved 28 July 2010 After 1933, Sloane rapidly began to accumulate credits in British films. The majority of these were cheaply made quota quickies which immediately vanished into oblivion, but occasionally there was a higher-profile and more prestigious production such as the Gracie Fields star vehicle Sing As We Go (1934), in which she was credited as \\"Violet, the Song-Plugger's Girlfriend\\". However Sloane toiled mainly in insignificant roles in inferior films for many years, and it was not until towards the end of the 1940s, aged over 50, that she began to find her services in increasing demand, with a notable improvement both in the quality of films and size of roles being offered to her. =1950-1963= A minor role in Alfred Hitchcock's 1949 British production Under Capricorn was followed the next year by her most widely admired and best-known screen performance in the critically acclaimed Boulting Brothers-directed Seven Days to Noon, as Goldie Phillips, the woman who helps the desperate Professor Willingdon (Barry Jones). The character of Goldie was written as an ageing ex-chorus girl - brassy, excessively made-up and cheaply and gaudily dressed, whiling away her days gossiping and tippling in local public houses. Although not explicitly stated, the script strongly implied that Goldie relied on casual prostitution to make ends meet. With the open and unquestioning way in which she offered assistance and shelter to Willingdon, and her devotion to her little dog Trixie, Goldie came across as a cheerful, good-hearted soul and Sloane's performance earned much praise from critics for the mixture of humour and pathos she brought to Goldie's character, in a way that a younger or more glamorous actress would have been unlikely to have been able to achieve. The next few years brought roles for Sloane in other well- known films, such as the 1953 Ealing Studios satire Meet Mr. Lucifer with Stanley Holloway and 1954 prison drama The Weak and the Wicked, in which she played Nellie Baden, an elderly compulsive shoplifter sharing the cells with, amongst others, Glynis Johns and Diana Dors. 1955 brought the Richard Widmark heist thriller A Prize of Gold and 1957 the legal comedy Brothers in Law. Sloane's last credit came in the Peter Sellers satire Heavens Above!, released two weeks before she died in London on 28 June 1963, aged 66.

In this document, José Martí exposed the causes that lead Cuba to fight against Spain to become an independent nation, free from economic or military control by any outside source. The \\"Manifesto of Montecristi\\" also clarifies that the war of liberation was not against Spain itself, but against the colonial regime that existed on the island for more than three centuries.http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/funfacts/montecris.htmThe Cuban Republic and José Martí: reception and use of a National symbolIDENTIDAD, ESPIRITUALIDAD Y COMPROMISO SOCIAL DE NUESTROS PRÓCERES/ Revista Vitral No. 78 * año XIII * marzo - abril de 2007  The Cuban War of Independence  Ten Years' War The Cuban fight for independence began with the Ten Years' War (1868–1878), the first of three wars fought as Cuba attempted to free themselves from Spanish rule. The war was brought on by an economic crisis (1866) as well as the desire to end slavery. While the farmers in Cuba struggled to feed their families, the colonial administration continued to bring in profit from military ventures. In response, enraged farmers rose to fight. The uprising started October 10. Though efforts nearly failed within the first few days, within weeks the numbers of volunteers reached 12,000. Soon, Maximo Gomez (a former cavalry officer for the Spanish army) joined the farmer’s fight, bringing a tactical advantage to the rebels. Eventually, rebels took over the city of Bayamo, making a significant victory that brought hope to the people. It was at this time, Cuba’s national anthem was composed. Within three months Bayamo was again seized by the Spanish, but by that time the city had been burned to the ground. As the war spread over the country, Gomez was replaced, but after the threat of ethnic cleansing, Gomez returned to his position. After time, the Cuban people held a constitutional assembly on April 10, 1869 in an attempt to create a new government for themselves. During the assembly, it was determined that a separation between military and civilian affairs would exist. While this was concluded rather peacefully between the people of Cuba, it resulted in the Spanish raging a war of extermination. In the end, 17 years of tension would exists between Cuba and Spain. The Little War Following the Ten Years' War, the Little War(1879–1880) began. Starting August 26, 1879 and led by Calixto Garcia as well as veterans from the Ten Years' War, the Cuban people once again attempted to rise against Spanish rule as the Cuban Revolutionary Committee was created. While the Little War was a continuation of the Ten Years' War, the Cuban people lacked leadership, supplies and motivation to achieve any true victories. Instead, the Cuban people simply hoped for a peaceful settlement with Spain. The war ended September 1880, as revolutionary leaders were arrested and the rebels were defeated. Following the Little War, Spain did little to follow through with their promises of reform. While Cuba was able to send representatives to the Spanish parliament, this brought no real change to the daily life of the Cuban people. Jose Marti After the Little War and preceding the Spanish–American War, rebel José Martí started to become a prominent figure in the fight for freedom. At age 18, Marti was sent into exile by the Spanish due to his radical political views. Following his second exile, he traveled to the United States where he worked to establish the Cuban Revolutionary Party as a force to be reckoned with. In 1895, Marti wrote and signed the Manifesto de Montecristi along with Máximo Gómez, outlining what he hoped would become Cuba’s declaration of independence, setting Cuba free from Spanish rule, as well as improving the economy and bringing equality to the country. Following the singing of the document in Montecristi, Marti returned to Cuba to fight alongside the rebels. Shortly after, he was killed in battle. The Manifesto of Montecristi Cuba’s revolution of independence, which initiated in Yara, has entered a new period of war. Cuba’s war of independence is not only for the good and the benefit of Cuba and America, but for the benefit of the world itself. The elected leaders of the revolution today confirm, admit, and recognize their obligation and duty, which is to let Cuba know that their homeland will not be bloodied without a reason or without a hope of triumph. Cuba is embarking upon this war with full certainty, of the capacity and ability of the Cuban people, to save the patria and to obtain their liberty and govern its independence. Cubans return to war with more educated and capable individuals, which are willing to fight, even though they know the dangers that this war represent, to help Cuba to become an independent nation, free from the intervention and the abuses of the Spanish regime or of any outside source.http://www.cubagob.cu/otras_info/minfar/defensa_ingles/ijose_jmarti.htm The revolutionary war is not the a capricious tentative of an independence more fearsome than useful, neither the triumph of one Cuban Political Party over another, or even the humiliation of one group of Cubans, which are mistaken in their beliefs or decisions, but the demonstration of the will of a nation that accomplished too much in the last war to get involved into a conflict that will just end in victory or defeat, without very deep causes to stand against human cowardice and its many disguises.http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/marti/Manifesto.htm This war is not against the Spaniard, who will be respected and even loved, and who will enjoy the liberty that will sweep away only from those who try to block its path. This war will not be a cradle of tyranny or disorder, which shows the moderation of Cubans. They will show respect to all the honorable Spaniard who remain neutral and do not oppose, or who even help, to the war of independence against the colonial regime over the island. However, the ones who oppose the war of liberation will be bloodied and persecuted; the Cubans started the war, and the Cubans and Spaniards should finish it. We will treat respect with respect, mistreat with mistreat, war with war, and friendship with friendship. There is another intolerable and unjustified thought, which the revolution wants to profit now: the senseless fear of the black race. Cuba, the revolution, all its heroes and martyrs, now deny the notion of any threat by the Negro race; this nonsense thought was inspired by the Spanish regime, for their benefit and to stir up fear in those individuals seeking for the revolutionary war. In Cuba, there are many inhabitants of one color or another; there are many white Cuba's sons who have forgotten their duty to their homeland and their patria. Why do novelty and a social status are more important for white men than the humanity, integrity, intelligence and even the life of a black compatriot? The revolution knows and proclaims that the black race should have the same rights as any other individual in Cuba; since they have demonstrated their intelligence and their virtue. Upon the shoulders of the black man, the republic of Cuba has moved in safety. Montecristi, 25 de Marzo de 1895. José Martí, M. Gómezhttp://www.historyofcuba.com/history/marti/Manifesto.htmhttp://www.damisela.com/literatura/pais/cuba/autores/marti/montecristi/index.htmhttp://www.biblioteca.org.ar/libros/725.pdf = General view of the document = To outline the Manifesto of Montecristi José Martí and Máximo Gómez stated that the war was to be waged by blacks and whites alike. It is to include the participation of all blacks in which it was very much crucial for the victory of war. Also, Spaniards who did not object to the war effort should be spared, since they choose to not involve themselves. No collateral damage should be done, private rural properties shall remain. With the end of the war, the revolution of the country shall bring new economic life to Cuba.José Martí Selected Writings (Penguin Classics) = After the document = Of the many contributions that José Martí has brought into Cuba, his spirit still lives on. In 1921 lawmakers that came from Matanzas, and Santa Clara, offered a bill that declares José Martí's birthday a national holiday. The bill was passed with much empathy, and was renowned as \\"The Law that Glorifies the Apostle.\\" With hardship came praise, and the newly made law ordered the requirement that \\"All municipalities dedicate not only a principal street in every town to Marti, but also a statue, bust, obelisk, commemorative column, bronze plaque or stone tablet\\" on public property. Not only did this law order principal streets or statues in name of him, but it includes that on an annual basis schoolchildren must offer tribute with flowers at any commemorative area where songs and verses were recited. People who attended listen to panegyrics from the many speakers that come.  References  Sources *Mauricio Augusto Font, Alfonso W. Quiroz.

He played as a linebacker for Coach Bo Schembechler at the University of Michigan and was selected as the Most Valuable Player on the 1974 Michigan Wolverines football team. He subsequently founded FAN, Inc., a non-profit organization established to identify and provide medical assistance to former NCAA athletes experiencing hardships as a result of injuries incurred during sanctioned NCAA activities. Monroe High School Strinko was born in Middletown, Ohio, the son of Thomas and Earlene Strinko. He attended Monroe High School in Monroe, Ohio, and earned three letters each in track and football and one in basketball. He was a linebacker and offensive tackle on the Monroe Hornets football team from 1968 to 1970. In Strinko's three seasons of varsity football at Monroe, the team lost only one football game. Strinko was selected for the All Mid Miami Conference three times, All Southwestern Ohio two times, All-Ohio two times, and was selected as a first-team Scholastic Coach Magazine High School All-American. In May 1971, he also received the Banquet of Champions award as the outstanding male high school athlete in the Greater Cincinnati area. In January 2010, Strinko was named as an honorable mention selection on the All-Time All-Ohio High School Football Team. Strinko also maintained a 4.0 grade point average as a high school student, and was the sports editor on the school paper and a member of the student council and National Honor Society. University of Michigan =Commitment to Michigan= As one of Ohio's top football recruits in the Class of 1971, Strinko was recruited by Alabama, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Stanford, Michigan and other universities. In January 1971, Strinko and his parents watched Super Bowl V with Ohio State Coach Woody Hayes at his house. The Strinkos were the only family invited and enjoyed a home-cooked meal prepared by Hayes' wife Anne. In March 1971, Strinko announced that he had accepted a scholarship to attend the University of Michigan. At the time of his commitment to Michigan, one Ohio newspaper reported: > \\"Herculean Steve Strinko, one of the most complete gridiron players in > Southwestern Ohio, signed a letter of intent to the University of Michigan, > Ann Arbor, Wednesday evening at his residence in the suburbs of Monroe. ... > Strinko, who possesses superbrains and super-brawn to complement a super- > personality, was all smiles as he inked his promise to attend the conference > football powerhouse.\\" Strinko dismissed the notion that he was a \\"traitor\\" for choosing Michigan over Ohio State, noting that he chose Michigan \\"because I liked Bo [Michigan head football coach Bo Schembechler] a lot. I was probably more impressed with him than with OSU Coach Woody Hayes. They (Michigan recruiters) said I'd definitely play linebacker here. That's what I've always wanted to play. Other schools said I might play somewhere else.\\" Strinko later recalled that Woody Hayes never got over his decision to attend Michigan. =1973 season= Strinko started all 11 games at middle linebacker for the undefeated 1973 Michigan Wolverines football team and set a University of Michigan record with 137 tackles during the 1973 season. The 1973 team won the first 10 games of the season but played Ohio State to a 10-10 tie in the final game of the season. The defense allowed only 68 points, an average of 6.2 points per game. The Big Ten Conference voted to send Ohio State to the Rose Bowl, and conference rules prevented a second Big Ten team from accepting a bowl bid. Before the 1974 rematch with Ohio State, Strinko said, \\"You're never going to see a team as high as Michigan in Columbus. It went to a vote last year and they shafted us. So we're not going to let them shaft us this time. The other day some of us were sitting around watching TV and one of the guys said, 'If you gave me an elbow pad before the Ohio State game I'd be ready to eat it.'\\" =1974 season= As a senior, Strinko started 10 games at middle linebacker for the 1974 team, missing one game due to a knee injury suffered in the fourth game of the season against Stanford. Strinko also called the signals on defense for the 1974 team that allowed only 75 points, an average of 6.8 points per game. In October 1974, Michigan defensive coordinator Gary Moeller called Strinko \\"the best linebacker we've had at Michigan. He hustles all over the field. I can see why the pro scouts are so high on him.\\" Strinko accumulated 117 tackles in 10 games and was selected by his teammates as the Most Valuable Player on the 1974 team. Years later, Strinko said, \\"Of all my accomplishments I consider [the 1974 Most Valuable Player award] the most important. I am humbled to this day at being its recipient and at times fear I have not lived up to its relevance. The Most Valuable Player Award, since it is voted on by your peers, is, at its essence, a reflection of leadership and dedication to 'TEAM'.\\" At the end of the 1974 season, Strinko was selected by the United Press International as a first-team All-Big Ten player and a second-team All-American player. Strinko's younger brother, Greg Strinko, also played for the 1974 Michigan team as a defensive end. Strinko later said that, outside of his family relationships, playing football at Michigan for Bo Schembechler was \\"the single most rewarding experience of my life. The camaraderie and meaningful friendships formed in those four years are enduring and special.\\" Detroit Lions Strinko was selected by the Detroit Lions in the 9th round (219th overall pick) of the 1975 NFL Draft. When Strinko was not drafted after the first six rounds, Michigan coach Bo Schembechler told reporters he was shocked: \\"Strinko hasn't been drafted yet? That is unbelievable! Astounding!\\" He underwent knee surgery before signing with the Lions in June 1975. Strinko's knee did not recuperate fully following the surgery, and he was placed on the injured reserve list for the entire 1975 season. Strinko later recalled: > \\"I had spent my rookie year, 1975, on injured reserve recovering from knee > surgery performed by the University of Michigan's Orthopedic Specialist, Dr. > O'Connor. You see the Lions would not sign me to a contract unless > Michigan's Team Doctor's performed the necessary surgery, as the injury had > occurred playing football at Michigan. This process relieved the Lions from > any liability.\\" Strinko attempted to make the Lions team in 1976, but he was unable to keep fluid off of his knee, and the Lions told him that his condition was chronic and degenerative. In the end, Strinko never played in an NFL game. FAN, Inc. In 2007, Strinko was awaiting knee replacement surgery and a determination by the Social Security Administration regarding his application for disability. He had no insurance and there was no organization in place that offered financial assistance to athletes injured while participating in college athletics. Strinko organized a non-profit organization called FAN, Inc., the Foundation for Athletes in Need. The mission of FAN, Inc., is to identify and provide medical assistance to former NCAA athletes experiencing hardships as a result of injuries incurred during sanctioned NCAA activities. Strinko states that he has been certified as 100% disabled, qualifying him for Medicare benefits, so that the funds raised by FAN, Inc., would not be used for his own medical needs. He noted that his goal is to assist others who are not fortunate to have the means to fund their medical care. On the FAN, Inc. web site, Strinko states: > \\"Over the course of time I have discovered what I believe is a serious gap > in services for former student athletes who have been injured while > participating in an NCAA sanctioned sport. These athletes have dedicated, > not only their hearts and minds but also their bodies to the success and > proliferation of their respective university athletic programs. Many of > these injuries have manifested into long-term, chronic problems. These > debilitating injuries are often left untreated which only exacerbates the > problem. My goal in the creation of FAN, Inc. ... is to assist these under > and uninsured individuals in obtaining relevant, professional services.\\" References Category:1952 births Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Sportspeople from Middletown, Ohio Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from the Cincinnati–Northern Kentucky metropolitan area Category:Players of American football from Ohio Category:People from Monroe, Ohio ","title":"Steve Strinko"},{"id":"28187292","text":"Hellin Kay (born October 5, 1972) is a filmmaker and photographer based in New York City.The Shoe Goddess. \\"Getting to Know Hellin Kay: Editor, Photographer, Stylist, You Name It... \\", The Shoe Goddess.

Its border to the north is Eje 3 Sur José Peón Contreras, to the south Viaducto Miguel Alemán, to the east San Antonio Abad Ave (Calzada de Tlalpan) and to the west Eje Central Lázaro Cárdenas. Colonia Algarín is located between colonias Buenos Aires (Eje Central), Álamos (Viaducto), Obrera (Eje 3 Sur) and Asturias (San Antonio Abad). On the south border, alongside Viaducto Miguel Alemán, flows the Río de la Piedad. This river, just as in the case as many other rivers of the city, is encased in cement. History The exact origin of the name is unknown. The family that owned the land in the area before the neighborhood was established was named Algara. One story states that one of the sons was a fan of sports, earning him the nickname of Algarín, which became extended to the family. The first houses of the neighborhood were built in the 1910s, when a square meter of land cost between 25 and 30 cents. The first main streets were Algarín, now Juan E. Hernández y Dávalos, and Casa del Niño and Hospicio, today Toribio Medina. Now the four main streets are: José Peón Contreras, Bolívar, Isabel La Católica, and 5 de Febrero. Most of the rest of the streets are named for writers, poets, historians and journalists: José María Bustillos, Antonio Plaza, Enrique Granados, Manuel Navarrete, Bernardo Couto, and Marcelino Dávalos. There was a hospice for street children called the Hospicio de Niños Expósitos that existed from 1905 until the 1960s, when it was demolished to house barracks associated with the Presidential Guard Brigade. Description View of the Los Tolucos pozole restaurant on Juan E. Hernández y Dávalos Street The area is known for restaurants that serve Guerrero style pozole, a type of meat and corn soup/stew as well as carnitas. It attracts many families for pozole, rivaling the San Camilito Market in Plaza Garibaldi. Recommended by newspaper El Universal, Chilango magazine and chowhound.com is \\"Los Tolucos\\", located on the corner of J. E. Hernández y Dávalos and Bolívar. It offers the white and green varieties. Another well-known place is Pozolería Tixtla next door. The parish church for the area is the Parroquia Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro, located on Juan E. Hernández y Dávalos Street. In 2007, the parish blessed a fleet of taxis dedicated to providing services to the disabled. This taxi service is base at the Magdalena de las Salinas and Gea González hospitals. In 1938, radio station XEQK-AM's receiving office was installed by baritone and orchestra conductor Angel H. Ferreiro in this neighborhood. The radio signal was sent by telephone and transmissions were made by remote control from Bellas Artes.A web page about the history of radio station XEQK, \\"La Hora Exacta\\" (\\"The Accurate Time\\" (in Spanish) The market of the area is located on Isabel La Católica Ave., between Eje 3 Sur and J.

It is gaining popularity as a long-range cartridge due to the wide availability of 0.338\\" projectiles that have a high ballistic coefficient. For instance, the Sierra Match King has a ballistic coefficient of 0.765 and is a popular choice for 338 Edge shooters. Design The 338 Edge is similar in ballistics to the .338 Lapua Magnum, but can be chambered in a regular magnum action without modification, making it an attractive cartridge for shooters looking for the high performance of .338 Lapua Magnum without requiring a special or custom action. The name \\"338 Edge\\" was coined by Shawn Carlock during his work with the wildcat in 2001 in order to distinguish the cartridge from the (then new) slightly shorter 338 Remington Ultra Magnum. Velocities in the 338 Edge are high, and the recoil can be substantial enough to make a rifle painful to shoot without a recoil reducing device such as a muzzle brake or suppressor. Recoil is approximately twice that of the popular .30-06 cartridge, for a given weight rifle.

The wetland status of 7,000 plants is determined upon information contained in a list compiled in the National Wetland Inventory undertaken by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and developed in cooperation with a federal inter-agency review panel (Reed, 1988). The National List was compiled in 1988 with subsequent revisions in 1996 and 1998. The wetland indicator status of a species is based upon the individual species occurrence in wetlands in 13 separate regions within the United States. In some instances the specified regions contain all or part of different floristic provinces and the tension zones which occur between them. While many Obligate Wetland (OBL) species do occur in permanently or semi- permanently flooded wetlands, there are also a number of obligates that occur in and temporary or seasonally flooded wetlands. A few species are restricted entirely to these transient-type wetland environments. Plant species are general indicators of various degrees of environmental factors; they are however not precise. The presence of a plant species at a specific site depends on a variety of climatic, edaphic and biotic factors, and the effect of individual factors such as degree of substrate saturation and depth and duration of standing water is impossible to isolate. Eastern red columbine (Aquilegia canadensis), a facultative wetland (FACW) species in Region 1–5; freshwater wetlands A plant's indicator status is applied to the species as a whole however individual variations may exist within the species, referred to as \\"ecotypes\\"; individual plants which may have adapted to specific environments as may occur in a microhabitat, which isn't indicative of the species as a whole. The morphological differences between these ecotypes and the relevant species may or may not be easily discerned.  Indicator Categories  Obligate wetland (OBL). * Almost always occurs in wetlands under natural conditions (estimated probability > 99%). Facultative wetland (FACW). *Usually occurs in wetlands (estimated probability 67% – 99%), but occasionally found in non-wetlands (estimated probability 1% – 33%). Facultative (FAC). *Equally likely to occur in wetlands and non-wetlands (estimated probability 34% – 66%). Facultative upland (FACU). *Usually occurs in non-wetlands (estimated probability 67% – 99%), but occasionally found in wetlands (estimated probability 1% – 33%). Obligate upland (UPL). *Almost always occurs in non-wetlands under natural conditions (estimated probability > 99%). A positive (+) or negative (−) sign is used for the facultative categories. The (+) sign indicates a frequency towards the wetter end of the category (more frequently found in wetlands) and the (−) sign indicates a frequency towards the drier end of the category (less frequently found in wetlands).National List of Plant Species That Occur in Wetlands -- North Central (Region 3).

The battle lasted for about two hours before the Tripolitans retreated. The Danes suffered one man killed and one wounded. As a result of the Danish victory, the Bey of Tripoli signed a peace treaty with Denmark on 25 May. On his return to Malta from Tripoli, De Holck, performed his quarantine of 38 days at the Lazzaretto in Marsamuscietto, together with Lieut. John Munk, Lieut. Emanuel Krieger, Lieut. Wolfgang Kaas, Commissar Gabriel Hetting and Doctor Mark Klausen. In acknowledgement of the kind treatment they had received, De Holck set up a commemorative marble tablet on 10 October 1797. During the battle of Copenhagen in 1801, Sarpen was under the command of Captain Lieutenant Carl Farbriuis de Tengnagel. Prior to the battle the Danes had sent her to The Skaw to serve as the eyes of the fleet. She served in Olfert Fischer's division in the Inner Run under Chamberlain Steen Bille and did not engage in any actual fighting. British service The British took possession of Sarpen under the terms of capitulation following the second battle of Copenhagen on 7 September 1807. Sarpen arrived on 7 November at Chatham where she was fitted out from November to August 1808. She was to be renamed Voltiguer but the Admiralty canceled the name change. After refit she joined the British Navy as HMS Sarpen. Commander James Gifford took command of Sarpen on 16 May 1808 for the North Sea and Baltic. In 1809 she came under the command of Commander John Sanderson Gibson and participated in the Walcheren Expedition. She took up station off Blackenbeg (probably Blankenberge). In early May Gibson boarded a vessel with an English license and found out from the Master information about the size and status of the French fleet at Terneuzen.

His desire for an annulment of his marriage was known as the King's Great Matter. Ultimately Pope Clement VII refused the petition; consequently, in order to give legal effect to his wishes, it became necessary for the King to assert his lordship over the Catholic Church in his realm. In passing the Acts of Supremacy in 1534, the English Parliament confirmed the King's supremacy over the Church in the Kingdom of England. This challenge to Papal supremacy resulted in a breach with the Catholic Church. By 1541, the Irish Parliament had agreed to the change in status of the country from that of a Lordship to that of Kingdom of Ireland. Unlike similar movements for religious reform on the continent of Europe, the various phases of the English Reformation as it developed in Ireland were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion in England gradually accommodated itself. In Ireland, however, the government's policy was not embraced by public opinion; the majority of the population continued to adhere to Roman Catholicism. Religious policy of Henry VIII Norman and English monarchs used the title \\"Lord of Ireland\\" to refer to their Irish conquests dating from the Norman invasion of Ireland. In passing the Crown of Ireland Act 1542, the Irish Parliament granted Henry, by his command, a new title – King of Ireland. The state was renamed the Kingdom of Ireland. The King desired this innovation because the Lordship of Ireland had been granted by the Papacy; technically, he held the Lordship in fief from the Pope. As Henry had been excommunicated in 1533 and again in 1538, he worried that his title could be withdrawn by his overlord – the Pope. Henry also arranged for the Irish Parliament to declare him the head of the \\"Church in Ireland\\". The main instrument of state power in the establishment of the state church in the new Kingdom of Ireland was the Archbishop of Dublin, George Brown. He was appointed by the King upon the death of the incumbent, though without the approval of the Pope. The Archbishop arrived in Ireland in 1536. The reforms were continued by Henry's successor – Edward VI of England. The Church of Ireland claims Apostolic succession because of the continuity in the hierarchy; however this claim is disputed by the Roman Catholic Church, which asserts that only those bishops approved by and in communion with the Holy See are legitimate. Henry's sanctions on outspoken Catholics and Lutherans differed; Catholics loyal to the Holy See were to be prosecuted as traitors, while Lutherans, much rarer in Ireland, were to be burned at the stake as heretics. He promulgated the Six Articles Act in 1539. Henry died in 1547. In his reign, prayers remained the same, with the Latin Breviary still used until the Book of Common Prayer (in English) was introduced from 1549. From 1548, for the first time, Irish Communicants were given wine and bread; the former Roman Rite of the Mass allowed a congregation to be given bread only, with wine taken by the priest. =Dissolution of the monasteries= Quin Abbey, a Franciscan friary built in the 15th century and suppressed in 1541 The dissolutions in Ireland followed a very different course from those in England and Wales. There were around 400 religious houses in Ireland in 1530—many more, relative to population and material wealth than in England and Wales. In marked distinction to the situation in England, in Ireland the houses of friars had flourished in the 15th century, attracting popular support and financial endowments, undertaking many ambitious building schemes, and maintaining a regular conventual and spiritual life. They constituted around half of the total number of religious houses. Irish monasteries, by contrast, had experienced a catastrophic decline in numbers, such that by the 16th century, it appears that only a minority maintained the daily religious observance of the Divine Office. Henry's direct authority, as Lord of Ireland, and from 1541 as King of Ireland, only extended to the area of the Pale immediately around Dublin. From the late 1530s his administrators temporarily succeeded in persuading some clan chiefs to adopt his policy of surrender and regrant, including the adoption of his state religion. Nevertheless, Henry was determined to carry through a policy of dissolution in Ireland – and in 1537 introduced legislation into the Irish Parliament to legalise the closure of monasteries. The process faced considerable opposition, and only sixteen houses were suppressed. Henry remained resolute however, and from 1541 as part of the Tudor conquest of Ireland, he continued to press for the area of successful dissolution to be extended. For the most part, this involved making deals with local lords, under which monastic property was granted away in exchange for oaths of allegiance to the new Irish Crown; and consequently Henry acquired little if any of the wealth of the Irish houses. By the time of Henry's death (1547) around half of the Irish monastic houses had been suppressed; but many houses of friars continued to resist dissolution until well into the reign of Elizabeth I. = Bishoprics = During the English Reformation, the Church of Ireland suffered in its temporal affairs: > \\"more than half the clerical property in the kingdom being vested in lay > hands; but that of Ireland was in a manner annihilated.

Cloyne. Religious policy of Edward VI Henry's son Edward VI of England (1547–53) formally established Protestantism as the state religion, which was as much a religious matter as his father's reformation had been political. His reign only lasted for six years and his principal reform, the Act of Uniformity 1549, had much less impact in Ireland than in England. He abolished the crime of heresy in 1547.1 Edward VI, cap. 12 During his reign attempts were made to introduce Protestant liturgy and bishops to Ireland. These attempts were met with hostility from within the Church, even by those who had previously conformed. In 1551, a printing press was established in Dublin which printed a Book of Common Prayer in English. Religious policy of Queen Mary I The counties in Ireland subjected to British plantations (1556 to 1620). Note that this map is a simplified one, as the amount of land colonised did not cover the entire shaded area. Henry's and Edward's efforts were then reversed by Queen Mary I of England (1553–1558), who had always been Roman Catholic. On her ascent to the throne, Mary reimposed orthodox Roman Catholicism by the First and Second Statute of Repeal of 1553 and 1555. When some Episcopal sees in Ireland became vacant, clerics loyal to Rome were chosen by Mary, with the approval of the Pope. In other cases, bishops in possession of dioceses that had been appointed by her father, without the approval of the Pope, were deposed. She arranged for the Act of Supremacy (which asserted England's independence from papal authority) to be repealed in 1554, and also revived the Heresy Acts.1554 Heresy Act In turn it was agreed that the former monasteries would stay dissolved, so as to preserve the loyalty of those who had sinfully bought monastic lands, by an Act passed in January 1555 and the agreement of Pope Julius III. In Ireland Mary started the first planned wholesale plantations of settlers from England that, ironically, soon came to be associated with Protestantism. In 1554 she married Philip, Prince of Asturias, who in 1558 became the King of Spain. Philip and Mary were also granted a papal bull in 1555 by Pope Paul IV to reconfirm their status as the Catholic King and Queen of the new Kingdom of Ireland.Papal Bull Ilius per quem Reges text in Latin; accessed March 2019 Also in 1555 the Peace of Augsburg established the principle of Cuius regio, eius religio, requiring Christians to follow their ruler's version of Christianity, and it must have seemed that the experiment of reformation had ended. Religious policy of Queen Elizabeth I Mary's Protestant half-sister, Queen Elizabeth I succeeded in having Parliament pass another Act of Supremacy in 1559.Notes and text of 1559 Act of Supremacy The Act of 1534 had declared the English crown to be 'the only supreme head on earth of the Church in England' in place of the Pope. Any act of allegiance to the Papacy was considered treasonous because the Papacy claimed both spiritual and political power over its followers. Additionally, the Irish Act of Uniformity, passed in 1560, made worship in churches adhering to the Church of Ireland compulsory. Anyone who took office in the Irish church or government was required to take the Oath of Supremacy; penalties for violating it included hanging and quartering. Attendance at Church of Ireland services became obligatory – those who refused to attend, whether Roman Catholics or Protestant nonconformists, could be fined and physically punished as recusants by the civil powers. Initially Elizabeth tolerated non-Anglican observance, but after the promulgation in 1570 of the Papal Bull, Regnans in Excelsis, Roman Catholics were increasingly seen as a threat to the security of the state. Nevertheless, the enforcement of conformity in Ireland was sporadic and limited for much of the sixteenth century. The issue of religious and political rivalry continued during the two Desmond Rebellions (1569–83) and the Nine Years' War (1594–1603), both of which overlapped with the Anglo-Spanish War, during which some rebellious Irish nobles were helped by the Papacy and by Elizabeth's arch-enemy Philip II of Spain. Due to the unsettled state of the country Protestantism made little progress, unlike in Celtic Scotland and Wales at that time. It came to be associated with military conquest and colonisation and was therefore hated by many. The political-religious overlap was personified by Adam Loftus, who served as Archbishop and as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The bulk of Protestants in Ireland during Elizabeth's reign were confined to the ranks of new settlers and government officials, who formed a small minority. Amongst the native Gaelic Irish and Old English, recusancy pre-dominated and was tolerated by Elizabeth for fear of alienating the Old English further. To them, the official state religion had already changed several times since 1533, and might well change again, as Elizabeth's heir until 1587 was the Roman Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots. Elizabeth established Trinity College, Dublin in 1592, partly in order to train clergy to preach the reformed faith. In 1571 a Gaelic printing typeface was created and brought to Ireland by dignitaries of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, to print documents in the Irish language for the purposes of evangelisation. The liturgy that was intended to be printed was to be used for the preaching in Irish in specially appointed churches in the main town of every diocese. The first translation of the New Testament into Irish was done in 1603, and a translation of the Gospels was sponsored by Richard Boyle. Religious policy of King James I The reign of James I (1603–25) started tolerantly, and the Treaty of London (1604) was signed with Spain, but the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 caused him and his officials to adopt a harder line against Roman Catholics who remained in the majority, even in the Irish House of Lords. So few had converted to Protestantism that the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation was introduced in 1612, much later than in the rest of Europe, typically marked by the Council of Trent, convened in 1545.Counter-Reformation, britannica.com The Flight of the Earls in 1607 led on to the Plantation of Ulster, but many of the new settlers were Presbyterian and not Anglican; reformed, but not entirely acceptable to the Dublin administration. The settlers allowed James to create a slight Protestant majority in the Irish House of Commons in 1613. The work of translating the Old Testament into Irish for the first time was undertaken by William Bedell (1573–1642), Bishop of Kilmore, who completed his translation within the reign of Charles I, although it was not published until 1680 in a revised version by Narcissus Marsh (1638–1713), Archbishop of Dublin. Bedell had undertaken a translation of the Book of Common Prayer published in 1606. In 1631 the Primate James Ussher published \\"A Discourse of the Religion Anciently professed by the Irish and Brittish\\", arguing that the earlier forms of Irish Christianity were self-governing, and were not subject to control by the Papacy.Ussher, James; A Discourse etc.; London, \\"RY\\" 1631 Ussher is more famous for calculating from the Bible that the earth was created on 22 October 4004 BCE. Policies of Commonwealth and Restoration regimes The final stage was marked by the Irish Rebellion of 1641 by those groups of the Irish nobility that continued in their loyalty to the crown, Roman Catholicism or both. The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649–53 briefly introduced Puritanism as the state religion. The Restoration period that followed and the brief reign of the Roman Catholic James II were characterised by unusual state tolerance for religions in their kingdoms. During the Patriot Parliament of 1689, James II, while remaining Catholic, also refused to abolish his position as head of the Church of Ireland, so ensuring that Protestant bishops attended its sessions. In the Williamite War in Ireland that followed, absolutism was destroyed but the majority of the population felt more conquered than ever. The Irish parliament introduced a series of \\"Penal Laws\\" with the ostensible purpose of displacing Roman Catholicism as the majority religion. However, there was no consistent attempt by the Protestant Ascendancy to actively convert the bulk of the population to Anglicanism, which suggests that their main purposes were economic – to transfer wealth from Roman Catholic hands to Protestant hands, and to persuade Catholic property owners to convert to Protestantism. An Irish translation of the revised Book of Common Prayer of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664–1747), and was published in 1712. Despite the Reformation's association with military conquest, the country produced outstanding philosophers who were Anglican Irish philosophers and writers, some of whom were Church of Ireland clergy, such as James Ussher, Archbishop of Dublin; Jonathan Swift, priest; John Toland, essayist, philosopher and free thinker; George Berkeley, bishop. The Presbyterian philosopher Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746) had a notable impact in Colonial America.

His story was undoubted, and Mauchley's insurance company settled with him on August 17, 1998. Approximately six months later, Mauchley confessed that his story was untrue – he had constructed the story upon seeing the uncovered manhole. He was charged with insurance fraud and theft by deception. Mauchley moved to dismiss the charges because, absent his confession, there was no independent evidence that a crime had actually occurred. The trial court denied the motion and Mauchley appealed. Mauchley appealed, citing the corpus delicti rule, which prohibits convicting a person based solely upon his or her confession. The Utah Court of Appeals reversed the denial of Mauchley's motion to dismiss. The Utah Supreme Court granted certiorari to examine the concept of corpus delicti. In a unanimous decision, the Court found that the corpus delicti rule was anachronistic and was not adequate in protecting an innocent person in the event of a false confession. In its place, the Court introduced the \\"trustworthiness standard,\\" which takes into account the circumstances of the confession while deciding its usability in court. Ellis v.

Estate of Ellis: The Unequivocal Death of Interspousal Immunity in Utah.\\" Utah State Bar. Utah Bar Journal, 21 September 2010. Found at The newlyweds Steven and Aimee Ellis were driving in Shelley, Idaho on January 2, 2001 when Steven Ellis lost control of his car. He swerved into oncoming traffic and crashed into a truck, killing himself instantly. Aimee Ellis sustained severe injuries (including significant head trauma) and was rushed to the hospital. In 2005, Mrs. Ellis filed a claim against her husband's estate for Mr. Ellis's negligence. The Third District Court dismissed her claim on the grounds of interspousal immunity, the principle under which \\"the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband.\\" Mrs. Ellis appealed to the Utah Supreme Court. Upon reviewing the case, the Court decided in a unanimous vote to overturn the district court's decision, holding that \\"the common-law doctrine of interspousal immunity has been abrogated in Utah with respect to all claims,\\" thus laying to rest the doctrine of interspousal immunity in Utah. Burke v. Lewis, 122 P.3d 533, 535 (Utah 2005)Burke v. Lewis, 122 P.3d 533, 535 (Utah 2005) http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/Burke071205.pdf Athan Montgomery sustained serious brain damage at the time of his birth. The birth injury allegedly occurred as a result of attending physician Dr. Gregory Drezga's actions and substandard care during Athan's delivery. Heidi Judd, Montgomery's mother, filed a medical malpractice suit against Drezga, but Drezga had left Utah by the time the suit was filed. Drezga's malpractice insurer would normally have held been responsible for Drezga's legal defense, but they requested that they be removed from responsibility on the grounds that Drezga was not present in Utah to assist in his own defense. Judd, hoping to ensure that she would still be able to collect any judgment against Drezga, filed a motion requesting the district court to appoint legal counsel to represent Drezga's interests. The district court appointed attorney Paul C. Burke to represent Drezga. Burke appealed the appointment order, but it was dismissed. Burke then filed a Petition for Extraordinary Relief to the Utah Supreme Court because of \\"his inability to gain speedy review of the appointment order through normal appellate channels.\\" The issue that the Utah Supreme Court was to decide was whether the district court acted outside of its discretion in appointing Burke to act in Drezga's defense absent an express statutory authorizing to do so. In a unanimous decision, the Court decided it was within the district court's discretion to appoint counsel in Drezga's absence, but because of the multitude of factors influencing the district court's decisions, the Supreme Court limited its decision to the unique facts in the case and declined to adopt a general rule that \\"appointment of counsel is generally an acceptable practice whenever an innocent third party may be subject to adverse repercussions if a judgment is entered against an absent civil litigant.\\" State v.

He appealed the decision to the Utah Court of Appeals on the grounds that the trial court hadn't suppressed condemning statements he had made prior to being read his Miranda Rights. Levin claimed that the trial court had incorrectly concluded that he had not been subjected to custodial interrogation (in which case, he would not have needed to be told his Miranda Rights). The Utah Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's decision. It concluded that while Levin had been subjected to interrogation, he was not in custody at the time of interrogation, thereby applying \\"a deferential 'abuse of discretion' standard of review to the trial court's determination that Levin was not 'in custody.'\\" Levin petitioned the Utah Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Court of Appeals had inappropriately applied an abuse of discretion standard in its review of the trial court's decision. The Utah Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and, in a unanimous decision, determined the trial court erroneously applied the more deferential \\"abuse of discretion\\" standard in reviewing whether Levin should have been given his Miranda rights. The Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, holding that \\"custodial interrogation determinations should be reviewed for correctness.\\" Conatser v.

Origins The metaphor was developed by researchers Anderson and Joglekar.Anderson, E.G. Jr. and Joglekar, N.R. (2007). \\"Chasing the Innovation Butterfly with 'Systems Thinking'\\", The Systems Thinker, 18(9): 7-9. It was conceived as a specific instance of the more general 'butterfly effect' encountered in chaos theory. How it works The innovation butterfly arises because many innovation systems are made up of a large number of elements that interact with each other via several non-linear feedback loops containing embedded delays, thus constituting a complex system.Sterman, J.D. (1994). \\"Learning in and about Complex Systems\\", System Dynamics Review, 10(2-3): 291-330. Perturbations can come from decisions made within the firm or from those made by its competitors, or they can result from external forces such as government legislation or environmental regulations, or unexpected spikes in the price of oil. How the innovation system evolves as a result of the innovation butterfly can lead ultimately to an innovative firm's success or failure. Complex systems, in domains such as physics, biology, or sociology, are known to be prone to both path dependence and emergent behavior. What makes the behavior of the innovation butterfly different is market selection, along with biases in individual and group decision making within distributed innovation settings, which may influence the emergent behavior. Furthermore, managers in most fields of business endeavor to reduce uncertainty in order to better manage risk. In innovation settings, however, because success is based upon creativity, managers must actively embrace uncertainty. This leads to a management conundrum because innovation managers and management systems must encourage the potential for a butterfly effect but then must also learn how to cope with its aftermath.Anderson and Joglekar (2007), pp. 7-9.Anderson, Edward G and Nitin R. Joglekar. (2012). The Innovation Butterfly: Managing Emergent Opportunities and Risks During Distributed Innovation. Springer (Understanding Complex Systems Series)\\" How innovation butterflies are 'chased' is highly managerially relevant.Anderson, Edward G. and Nitin Joglekar (2005). A Hierarchical Modeling Framework for Product Development Planning. Production and Operations Management, 14 (3): 344-361. Most butterflies end up 'merely' consuming a considerable amount of time and resources within a project, or for an innovation portfolio, within a firm. However, some butterflies can also unleash regime-altering emergent outcomes within an entire industry segment.Garud, R. and Karnøe, P. 2001 Path Creation as a Process of Mindful Deviation. In Path Dependence and Creation, R. Garud and P. Karnøe (eds.) Lawrence Erlbaum Associates: 1-38. Moreover, once these emergent outcomes begin to mature, and in some instances lead to disruptive innovations, they become extremely difficult to manage,Christensen, Clayton M. (1997).

After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Israel began to displace the Bedouin of the Negev desert, and by 1953 had expelled 90% of the roughly 100,000 people in the northern Negev. According to Eyal Weizman, various methods, from strafing to massacres and tent burning were employed, and the refugees moved to Gaza and the West Bank. The survivors were swept into a more salinated area, into a reservation, known as Siyāj. The Bedouin who came from Al-Araqib (\\"Gentle Hills\\"), such as the al-Tūris and al-‘Uqbis have nonetheless persisted in returning to their ancestral lands, and their village lies precisely on the 200mm RPA (rainfall per annum) drawn by Israeli meteorologists on the basis of a schema developed by Wladimir Köppen to define cultivable land from the desert. Two archives have been established to document the local Bedouins rights to their land, one by Nūri al-‘Uqbi and another by Israeli geographer Oren Yiftachel. Israeli courts have so far rejected suits to reclaim this land, refusing, according to Weizman, to acknowledge Bedouin tenure south of the 200 mm line, which is reserved for kibbutzim and moshavim.George Prochnik with Eyal Weizman, 'The Desert Threshold,' Los Angeles Review of Books 18 October 2015. In 2012 an Israeli court turned down a suit by the al-'Uqbis to have their title, based on a claim of continuous cultivation, recognized by the state.Joanna Paraszczuk and Sharon Udasin, 'Court rejects 6 Beduin Negev land lawsuits,' The Jerusalem Post 19 March 2012. The Jewish National Fund planned to include the land of Al-Araqeeb in a new forestation project in the Negev Desert called Ambassadors' Forest, honoring the assistance provided to Israel by the world's diplomatic corps. This plan spurred objection from some Bedouin living in Rahat and several villages nearby. In July 2010 the village was demolished by 1,300 police officers, acting under orders of the Israel Land Administration. After a six-year-long court case, in a precedent-setting ruling on March 15, 2012, the Beersheba District court ruled against the six lawsuits brought by Al-Uqbi family, which claimed their private ownership of land in the Al- Araqeeb area.Jerusalem Post, \\"Court rejects 6 Beduin Negev land lawsuits\\", March 19, 2012. Based upon the experts' testimony and the presented evidence, the judge ruled that this land belongs to the State. The court ruling was left disregarded - the Bedouin came back to the place 59 times to rebuild the structures, but each time they were razed back by the state. Aziz al-Touri, a representative of the village has asked why Jews are permitted to move to the Negev and live in kibbutzim, moshavim and isolated farms while that right is denied the Bedouin desiring to dwell in their own villages. The interviewers comment that the 1948 Palestinian exodus never ended. Land ownership Map of the region surrounding the city of Beer Sheba in the 1940s depicting the location of al-Araqeeb tribe as 9 kilometers due north of the city The Bedouin families of Arakib say they own about 4,600 acres of the Negev desert, and that they paid property taxes to the Ottoman Empire and later to the British Mandatory authorities in Palestine. Community leaders say they were forced by Israel's military into settlements along the border of the West Bank in 1951, and that they have been pushed off their land whenever they have since tried to return. Israeli officials say the property was taken over by the state in the early 1950s because it was abandoned, and because its inhabitants were unable to produce deeds. They maintained that the Bedouins have been squatters who refused to pay rent; they cultivated land that did not belong to them, and were raising animals without livestock permits. Authorities claim that there has never been a permanent Bedouin settlement in the area. The Ottoman authorities permitted the clan members to graze their sheep and cows on this land, but did not give them ownership over it. According to the Israel Lands Administration (ILA), Bedouins began illegally settling in the area in 1998, and several dozen families built homes in the area in 1999 when it appeared the government was attempting to seize the land. The ILA offered to rent the land for 2 NIS per dunam, but the inhabitants refused to pay and \\"continued to infiltrate the land year after year.\\" In 2000, an Israeli court order banned the Bedouins from entering the area. The ruling was disregarded, as Bedouins continued to move into the area and plant trees. In 2003, the ILA secured a court order to evacuate the residents, and the case went to the Israeli Supreme Court. In 2004, though one resident speaks of crop dusters poisoning the fields in the later 1990s, the Israel Land Administration used crop duster fumigation to destroy the residents' wheat crops.Nir Hasson and Haaretz Correspondent, \\"Negev Bedouin protest home demolitions, crop destruction\\", Haaretz, Feb 15, 2004. This practice was outlawed by the court in 2007 after the Adalah legal center for Arab rights in Israel filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court on behalf of the residents of Al-Araqeeb and Wadi al- Bakar. Tens of thousands of structures have been built in Bedouin communities, and new ones are built more quickly than the state can demolish them.Ben Hartman, \\"State demolishes Beduin homes again\\", The Jerusalem Post, May 8, 2010 They are illegal since the state never issues construction permits for the unrecognized villages. In July 2011 the state filed a NIS 1.8 million suit against 34 Bedouins from the Abu Mediam and Abu Jabber families, whom they accuse of illegal encroachment on state lands. The suit seeks to reclaim the state costs of evicting families from the Negev village.State sues Beduin of al-Arakib village for NIS 1.8m Evictions Demolished house in Al-Araqeeb In July 2010, Israel Land Administration inspectors and 1,300 police officers demolished the villages' 46 buildings and uprooted 850 trees, which were transferred for replanting elsewhere. Witnesses told CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riot police who stormed the village were accompanied by \\"busloads of cheering civilians\\". Israeli police said that there were \\"no disturbances\\". Hundreds of olive trees belonging to the villagers were uprooted.

Six people were arrested during the second demolition of the village. The Bedouin Knesset member, Taleb el-Sana, was forcibly removed from the scene by police after he had tried to stop the demolition. Over the next two weeks, the village was demolished a third (August 10) and a fourth time (August 17) after residents rebuilt it.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129662776 The demolition on August 17 took place at dawn during Ramadan while the villagers were fasting. Throughout the following months, residents continued to return to the village and build makeshift structures. On January 16, 2011, Israeli security forces demolished eleven makeshift buildings. Protesters clashed with police, who responded with pepper spray and paintball guns. Five protesters were injured.

Court findings Aerial shot of Al-Araqeeb in 2007 presented by the state in court In late 2006, seventeen Bedouin of the al-Uqbi family filed six land claims saying that the land they are on, including Al- Araqeeb, belongs to them. After five years of legal proceedings, the court heard extensive testimonies of experts and witnesses on the behalf of both sides, reviewed historical documents, and scrutinized land laws from the Ottoman period, the British mandate period and that of Israel. The country's leading experts in historical and political geography testified. For the plaintiffs spoke Ben Gurion University’s Prof. Oren Yiftachel, a critical geographer and a social scientist. Testifying for the state was Prof. Ruth Kark, a leading expert on the historical geography of Palestine and Israel from the Hebrew University. The plaintiffs argued that the state order to expropriate the land in 1951 was made on the erroneous assumption that under Ottoman law, the land was classified as Mawat (uncultivated and not adjacent to settled lands). They said that the land had been cultivated and owned by them, and so classified as Miri land under Ottoman legal terms. In an expert opinion filed to the court, Oren Yiftachel said that these “tribal areas” of scattered tent clusters were not at that time registered with the authorities, but were nevertheless considered settled and met the definition of a “village” in the 1921 Land Ordinance. The state’s expert witness, Prof. Ruth Kark, said that prior to 1858 there had been no fixed settlements on or near the disputed land. The first permanent settlement had been Beersheba, which the Ottomans founded in 1900 and which is 11 kilometers from Al-Araqeeb – refuting the Beduin’s claims that the land could not have been Mawat because it was both cultivated and next to a settlement. The State presented an aerial shot of the place which they said proved that the Al-Araqeeb area had no cultivated land during the British mandate period.Nadav Shragai, \\"The True Story of Al- Araqeeb\\", March 19, 2012. Israel Hayom (Israel Today), Hebrew The bedouin presented aerial photographs from 1945 onwards which they said showed extensive cultivation. The verdict was presented by Judge Sarah Dovrat in the Beersheba District court on March 15, 2012. Based on the experts' testimony and the presented documents, the judge ruled in favor of the State, saying that the land was not \\"assigned to the plaintiffs, nor held by them under conditions required by law,\\" and that they still had to \\"prove their rights to the land by proof of its registration in the Tabu\\" (Israel Lands Authority). The judge said that the Bedouin knew they were supposed to register but did not. She said, \\"The state said that although the complainants are not entitled to compensation, it has been willing to negotiate with them,\\" and that \\"it is a shame that these negotiations did not reach any agreement.\\" The court also ordered the Bedouin to pay legal costs of 50,000 NIS (approximately U.S. $13,500). In its ruling, the court criticized the expert on the behalf of the plaintiffs, stating that his testimony lacked a sufficient factual basis value and reliable basis. In addition, the court held that the Bedouins' own internal documentation indicates they were well aware of the legal requirement to register the lands in the Land Registry, but chose not to do so. The judge affirmed that the practice of removal of encroached settlements carried out by the State is acceptable and legal. In spite of the court ruling, the Al- Araqeeb residents continued to erect structures at the site.

It was established in 1973 by Louise Simons and R. Daniel Evans in connection with the Painted Bride Art Center, an art gallery founded in 1969 in an old bridal shop on South Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The journal is supported by Drexel University in Philadelphia. It is staffed by a mix of volunteer editors and changing student staff. The magazine is published quarterly online and yearly in print. The magazine, which sees itself as \\"literary forum for poetry, fiction, prose, essays, interviews and photography\\", has a dual-city editorial staff in Philadelphia and New York. PBQ has featured works by such poets as Charles Bukowski, Etheridge Knight, Sonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka, Dede Wilson, Simon Perchik, Yusef Komunyakaa, Gregory Pardlo, and Major Jackson, among others. PBQ is the only magazine of its longevity to have a complete archive of its history available online. History In 1969, Gerry Givnish and a group of his artist friends founded a gallery space on Philadelphia's South Street in an old bridal shop. The cooperative gallery began a cultural revolution in the area. Soon, dozens of art galleries blossomed, but none as provocative, daring or enduring as theirs. The group of artists staked their claim on their patch of street with a window display. Among the remains of the bridal shop was a mannequin, made up for some hellish ‘60s wedding she would never attend. The artists took her straight to the storefront to cause a scene, but not in a typical virginal, white wedding gown. Soon, the \\"Painted Bride\\" became a South Street attraction. People would stop by just to see what provocative outfit or lewd position she’d be in that day. She was the icon and namesake of the art center that, in 1973, gave birth to Painted Bride Quarterly.  Events  PBQ holds interactive prose and poetry events to make its presence known in the Philadelphia area. On the last Thursday of the month, the journal hosts a poetry slam at the Pen & Pencil Club called \\"Slam, Bam, Thank You, Ma’am.\\" Monthly poetry readings are held in both Philadelphia and New York, featuring local poets and musicians. On May 13, 2009, PBQ held its first annual Bookfair for Literacy, raising funds for Philadelphia Reads and donating the remaining books to Books Through Bars. More than twenty regional presses and literary magazines attended and sold their wares at below costs. For a few months prior to the event, books were donated by members of the Drexel community, and then sold with all proceeds going to Philadelphia Reads. The Second Annual Bookfair for Literacy was held on Friday, May 21, 2010.  Awards and honors  PBQ has had many of its first-published poems chosen for Pushcart Prizes, on Poetry Daily, and other accolades, such as inclusion in Online Writing: The Best of the First Ten Years.

This is a perennial herb growing from one or more fleshy roots and reaching maximum heights between 20 and 60 centimeters. The stem is hairy, with rough, bristly hairs near the base and finer ones higher up. The leaves have blades deeply divided into narrow linear lobes, almost divided into leaflets. The leaves are fleshy and waxy in texture. The inflorescence is an open panicle of several flowers each with five pinkish purple petals up to 1.5 centimeters long. The leaves and flower sepals are coated in tiny branching hairs. Threats to this species include a dropping water table, which prevents water from accumulating at the surface in the plant's alkaline-seep habitat, moving the water out of reach of the plant.

State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 98 P.3d 409 (Utah 2004) = The facts, as cited in the summary presented in the issued Utah Supreme Court opinion, were as follows: :Mr. Campbell was responsible for an automobile accident that disabled Robert Slusher and killed Todd Ospital. At the time, Mr. Campbell was insured by State Farm up to $25,000. State Farm chose not to settle the case. At trial, Mr. Campbell was found 100 percent responsible and a judgment was entered against him for $135,000. State Farm refused to pay this amount, suggesting instead that the Campbells put their house up for sale to pay off the judgment. Although State Farm did eventually pay the judgment, the Campbells sued for bad faith. At trial, the Campbells were permitted to introduce evidence that State Farm had a comprehensive nationwide policy of handling certain claims in a like manner.Campbell v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. 98 P.3d 409 (Utah 2004) - http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/campbe042304.htm :The jury awarded the Campbells $2,086.75 in special damages, $2.6 million in compensatory damages, and $145 million in punitive damages. The trial judge remitted this amount to $1 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages.Id. The case of Campbell v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. is one of the highest profile cases considered by the Utah Supreme Court during the term of Nehring's service as a Utah Supreme Court justice. The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of the court's decision and entered a landmark opinion limiting the award of punitive damages. The United States Supreme Court reversed the jury verdict and remanded the case to the Utah Supreme Court to determine the factors to be considered in punitive damage cases to insure that any punitive damages awarded would be awarded in a manner consistent with the United States Supreme Court opinion. The task of writing the new opinion for the Utah Supreme Court fell to Justice Nehring. In providing a background for his opinion Nehring wrote: :We take up this case after remand from the United States Supreme Court, which held that the imposition of a $145 million punitive damages award against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in favor of State Farm's insured, Curtis B. Campbell, and his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, was excessive and violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003) (Campbell II) (rev'g 2001 UT 89, 65 P.3d 1134 (Campbell I)). The Supreme Court directed us to recalculate the punitive damages award under principles articulated in its decision. We have performed this task and reduced the jury's award to $9,018,780.75 in punitive damages, a figure nine times the amount of compensatory and special damages awarded to the Campbells.Id.  Fourth Amendment  = Brigham City v. Stuart, 122 P.3d 506 (Utah 2005) = The facts, as cited in the summary presented in the issued Utah Supreme Court opinion, were as follows: :Four Brigham City police officers responded to a complaint of a loud party. They arrived at the offending residence at about three o'clock in the morning. They traveled to the back of the house to investigate the noise. From a location in the driveway, the officers peered through a slat fence and observed two apparently underage males drinking alcohol. The officers then entered the backyard through a gate, thereby obtaining a clear view into the back of the house through a screen door and two windows. The officers saw four adults restraining one juvenile. The juvenile broke free, swung a fist and struck one of the adults in the face. Two officers then opened the screen door and \\"hollered\\" to identify themselves. When no one heard them, they entered the kitchen. After entering, one of the officers again shouted to identify and call attention to himself. As those present in the kitchen became aware of the officers, they became angry that the officers had entered the house without permission.Brigham City v. Stuart, 122 P.3d 506 (Utah 2005) - http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/brigha021805.htm :The officers subsequently arrested the adults. They were charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. The defendants filed a motion to suppress which gave rise to this petition.Id. The Utah Supreme Court in a 3-2 opinion authored by Justice Nehring held that police officers could not enter a home without a warrant unless appropriate exigent circumstances justified the intrusion. The opinion further held that a suspicion of domestic violence was an insufficient exigency to justify intrusion without a warrant.Id. The decision of the Utah Supreme Court was overturned by the United States Supreme Court which held that police may \\"enter a home without a warrant when they have an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seriously injured or imminently threatened with such injury.\\"Brigham City v.

Swensen, 108 P.3d 725 (Utah 2005) = The issue before the court was whether a physician's letter concerning the condition of Salt Lake County Mayor Nancy Workman was sufficient to permit the Salt Lake County Republican Party to replace Mayor Workman on the ballot for the November 2, 2004 general election for the office of Salt Lake County Mayor. After receiving the nomination by the Salt Lake County Republican Party to run for reelection, Mayor Workman was charged with two felonies relating to alleged misuse of county funds. The Republican party sought to withdraw her name and substitute a new nominee on the ballot. The district court ruled that the letter was not sufficient and entered an order barring Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen from replacing Mayor Workman's name on the ballot.Adams v. Swensen, 108 P.3d 725 (Utah 2005) - http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/adams020105.htm Justice Nehring authored the opinion of a unanimous 5-0 court that reversed the decision of the District Court thus allowing the substitute candidate's name to be placed on the ballot. In his opinion, Nehring opined that an election should ensure the full opportunity for individuals to become candidates and for voters to express their choice.Id.  Court Procedures  = Allen v. Friel, 194 P.3d 903 (Utah 2008) = The facts, as stated by Justice Nehring in the introductory section of his published opinion, were as follows: :Mr. Allen, pro se, filed a petition for post-conviction relief under the Post-Conviction Relief Act. Utah Code Ann. § 78-35a-101 to -304 (2002). Mr. Allen's petition alleged five broad claims for relief; the district court, however, discovered eleven separate claims in the petition. The claims the district court found were (1) that there was judicial bias; (2) that the prosecution used false testimony during trial; (3) that the jurors were not fair and impartial; (4) that the trial court erred in refusing to give his proffered jury instructions; (5) that the jury instructions and special verdict form were erroneous; (6) that the trial court erred by trying him for multiple offenses; (7) that the Utah Supreme Court's decision on his direct appeal was result- driven and erroneous; (8) that the trial court's errors resulted in a trial that was fundamentally unfair; (9) that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial; (10) that there was ineffective assistance of trial counsel; and (11) that there was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Mr. Allen's petition also challenged the trial court's denial of the jurors' request for transcripts of the prosecution witnesses' testimony.Allen v. Friel, 194 P.3d 903 (Utah 2008) - http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/Allen4081908.pdf The case was filed by Mr. Allen, pro se, and not with the assistance of a lawyer. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Nehring upheld the trial court's ruling and also ruled that in order to challenge rulings made at trial, an appellant must adequately brief the issues asserted on appeal, must provide to the appellate court an adequate record to support the contentions raised in the appeal, and must procedurally and properly challenge the trial court's decision in order for the appeal before relief on appeal can be granted by an appellate court.Id.

The area's total size is , of which is underwater. History Princes Bay Light on a bluff at Mount Loretto Unique Area Mount Loretto was once the largest orphanage in New York State. It was started by Father John Christopher Drumgoole, an Irish Catholic priest and founder of the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin in Manhattan, an organization to help poor and disposed children. He purchased the Staten Island land for the orphanage in the 1890s and named it \\"Mount Loretto\\" in honor of one of the nuns who worked with him at the mission. It was served by the Mount Loretto Spur of the Staten Island Railway. The area that encompasses the Mount Loretto Unique Area was purchased from the Archdiocese of New York by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in 1999. The property formerly contained various buildings including the St. Elisabeth's girls' dormitory, a large Victorian Era building which was destroyed by arson during the time title to the land was being transferred to the state. Geography and natural history Today, Mount Loretto has approximately of shoreline fronting Prince's Bay and Raritan Bay. Along the shoreline are the highest ocean-facing bluffs in New York State, which reach a height of . The bluffs are part of a terminal moraine (deposits of clay and gravel deposited during periods of glaciation); they are remnants left by the Wisconsin Glacier, which reached its southernmost terminus in Staten Island. The highest bluff is the location of an historic lighthouse the Princes Bay Light. The stone lighthouse, which was built in 1864 with an attached lighthouse keeper's cottage built in 1868, is a New York State Landmark. Shrine of the Immaculate Virgin Within the preserve, in addition to the bluffs, there are extensive brackish and freshwater wetlands including a large vernal pond. The preserve contains a wide variety of native plants, shrubs, and trees, owing to the diverse habitats represented within the park. There are various species of birds which frequent the park during various parts of the year. Its large mowed fields make it attractive to many species of upland shorebird such as buff-breasted sandpiper and upland sandpiper. Other field birds, such as eastern meadowlark and bobolink, can also be found here during migration. The wetlands areas support habitat utilized by various species of waterfowl such as the wood duck (Aix sponsa), blue and green-winged teal, as well many many species of ducks, waders and marsh birds. Many rare birds have visited the preserve including white ibis, scissor-tailed flycatcher and western kingbird. The preserve is also home to snakes, turtles frogs and toads, as well as raccoons, chipmunks, moles and field mice.

When Abbo, the saecular rector of the region of Maurienne and Susa and later Patrician of Provence, founded the Abbey of Novalesa on 30 January 726, he put it under the Benedictine rule and independent of the local bishop, that of Maurienne.Marios Costambeys, Power and Patronage in the Early Medieval Italy: Local Society, Italian Politics, and the Abbey of Farfa, c.700–900 (Cambridge: 2007), pp. 2–3. When he drew up his will thirteen years later (739) he directed that Novalesa should come under the protection of Bishop Walchunus.The identification between the Walchunus of Abbo's testament and the contemporary bishop of Maurienne was argued by C. Cipolla, ed., Monumenta Novaliciensia Vetustiora (Rome: 1898–1901), vol. I, p. 7, n. 1. This action did not place Novalesa under episcopal authority; it merely recognised the saecular stature of the bishop in the region.A point made by Patrick Geary, Aristocracy in Provence: The Rhône Basin at the Dawn of the Carolingian Age (Stuttgart: 1985), pp. 124–25. The role of protector of the monastery passed in the later years of the century to the ruling Carolingians, who also confirmed its independence of the bishop.

Source Separated Organics (SSO) is the system by which waste generators segregate compostable materials from other waste streams at the source for separate collection. Types of Materials Organic materials, such as yard trimmings, food scraps, wood waste, and paper and paperboard products, typically make up about one- third (by weight) of the municipal solid waste stream.http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw2008rpt.pdf SSO programs depend on the composition of local waste stream, acceptance specifications for the organics processing facility, and collection methods. The types of organic materials collected include: * Yard and landscaping debris: floral trimmings, tree trimmings, leaves, grass, brush, and weeds * Food waste: organic residues generated by the handling, storage, sale, preparation, cooking, and serving of foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood, shellfish, bones, rice, beans, pasta, bakery items, cheese, eggshells, and coffee grounds * Paper fibers: waxed cardboard, napkins, paper towels, uncoated paper plates, tea bags, coffee filters, wooden crates, and greasy pizza boxes * Wood waste: urban wood waste, woody debris from suburban land clearing, and rural forestry residuals Programs SSO programs have been launched in a wide range of venues, including single-family residential units, commercial businesses, events, food processors, schools, hospitals, and airports. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has assembled tools and resources for food waste management to assist communities interested in launching their own food waste reduction and collection efforts. SSO materials are typically collected in wet-strength paper bags, unlined plastic bins, or compostable film-plastic liners that meet ASTM 6400 standards. Benefits The organic fraction of the waste stream is increasingly viewed as a resource. The resulting products – renewable energy and compost – benefit the environment: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; reduce dependency on foreign energy imports; increase the nutrient composition of our soils; reduce the amount of waste going to landfills; reduce the amount of wet, sloppy waste going to other methods of disposal; reduce the leachate associated with stormwater management at landfills; reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from uncontrolled landfill operations; improve erosion and stormwater control through biofiltration (Schwab, 2000). Barriers to adoption Communities and businesses that want to implement SSO programs face a few challenges. First, they need participation at the source of their organic waste generation. Second, they need a hauler willing to collect the organic waste. Third, they need a composting facility permitted to process the material. These challenges have been overcome by many successful SSO programs. Tactics for addressing barriers to adoption include creating outreach and education materials,http://www.stopwaste.org/docs/foodscrap_pitch_2_01.pdfhttp://www.cetonline.org/Publications/res- schools- online.pdfhttp://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/compost/compost_pdf/schmanual.pdf forging partnerships between local businesses to share fixed collection costs,http://www.jgpress.com/archives/_free/000496.html and creating incentives for organic diversion through regulated tip fees for solid waste and organics. Processing Organic materials collected in SSO programs typically get delivered to composting facilities where the waste is turned into nutrient-rich soil amendments known as compost. Organic feedstock can also be delivered to anaerobic digestion facilities that produce biogas, a source of renewable energy. The resulting biogas (methane) can then be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to hydrogen for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells.

He was born in Craiova, in the Oltenia region of Wallachia. Entering the Land Forces as a volunteer Sergeant in 1858, he was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant in 1861 and Captain in 1868. He fought in the Romanian War of Independence, where he was part of the 8th Line Regiment, commanding its 1st Battalion. During the first of three assaults against the Grivitsa I redoubt of the defensive works of the Pleven fortifications, he shouted while at the head of his troops, \\"După mine, copii!\\" (\\"After me, children!\\"). Holding his sword in one hand and a tricolor flag in another, he reached the citadel's edge,Hentea, p.108 after which he fell into a ditch, riddled with bullets. Following the first retreat of the Romanian troops, the Ottoman soldiers guarding the redoubt took the bodies of Mărăcineanu and of Major Gheorghe Șonțu, sticking them as trophies onto the redoubt's parapet.Rosetti, p.123 After the war, a street near Bucharest's Cișmigiu Gardens was named in honour of Mărăcineanu.

Later career In 1977 the first televised Full Contact Karate matches of the PKA made its way onto television. The involvement of Joe Corley and Jerry Piddington with the PKA to organize and promote the sport of Full Contact Karate were covered by Sports Illustrated. In 1979 Mr. Corley became a partner in the Professional Karate Association (PKA), which was a martial arts organization instrumental in establishing professional kickboxing as a sport in the United States. Corley also became a commentator for American Karate on national television, along with Chuck Norris and Pat Morita, appearing on NBC, CBS, ESPN, Showtime, USA Network, SportsChannel America, Prime Network and Fox Sports South. With Chris McLoughlin, Corley founded the annual Battle of Atlanta karate event in 1980. In February 1990, Corley was featured in a Black Belt Magazine article. Joe Corley was named Man of the Decade by Official Karate magazine and was inducted into the Black Belt Magazine Hall of Fame as Man of the Year in 1998.Black Belt Hall of Fame Awards He appeared in the documentary films Modern Warriors (2002) and Mystic Origins of the Martial Arts (1998). He also appeared in the Joe Lewis film Force Five in 1985. On June 15, 2013, Joe Corley was presented the Joe Lewis Eternal Warrior Award by the Joe Lewis Fighting System, an honor bestowed on the martial arts athletes who had distinguished themselves in the ring of point karate and/or kickboxing. On June 16, 2016, Master Corley was promoted to the rank of 10th Degree Black Belt, Grand Master, by the Professional Karate Commission (PKC). The certificate was presented by Grand Master Glenn Keeney, president of the PKC, along with Grand Master Allen Steen, and was also approved by Grand Masters pat Johnson and J. Pat Burleson. In August 2017 Grand Master Corley was featured on the cover of Who's Who in the Martial Arts Legends Edition along with Grand Masters Bill \\"Superfoot\\" Wallace, Jeff Smith, and Bill Clark. It was prominently featured in Lifetime Achievement section. In early 2018, Corley was seeking financing for the new era of PKA Kickboxing and organizing broadcasts for these events.

Most recently, he filed as a candidate for the 2010 Republican nominations for governor in the Tennessee gubernatorial election and U.S. House of Representatives in Tennessee's 3rd congressional district. Owing in part to his unconventional viewpoints, his 2010 campaign for Governor became something of a media sensation. Marceaux previously ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for United States Senate and House of Representatives and ran unsuccessfully for Tennessee governor in 2002 as an independent candidate. Biography Marceaux was born in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. He received an associate's degree in business administration from Edmondson Junior College in Chattanooga, and served as a United States Marine.

He has listed his professions as an inventor, entrepreneur, importer-exporter and historian. He is married to Getona Deaver and has two children. Marceaux is currently a resident of Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee. According to the Hamilton County Criminal Court of Tennessee, Marceaux has been the defendant in 19 criminal cases. Many of the cases were concerning misdemeanor traffic violations. According to court records, in 7 of the 19 cases, Marceaux was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Marceaux himself confirmed that he was ordered to be hospitalized for observation at Tennessee's Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute twice. Additionally, Marceaux has been found guilty in a case involving vandalism and possession of drug paraphernalia, and in one case involving theft. A Hamilton County Judge once noted that Marceaux \\"has filed many, many lawsuits in the court of General Sessions.

He studied his craft at the École des Beaux-Arts and went on to become a renowned and influential landscape artist noted for his sweeping skies, tree studded-plains, and vibrant farmlands. He was regularly recognized by a broad range of art critics as one of the most significant heirs to the Barbizon school tradition. Teachers & Influences Landscape in Summer (oil on panel) Damoye studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in the studio of Léon Bonnat, one of the foremost figure painters and portraitists of the late nineteenth- century. Damoye, however, seems to have committed himself to landscape art from the beginning of his career. His earliest dated works from the late 1860s also clearly reveal the influence of both Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Charles-François Daubigny, from whom he acquired both a brighter range of colors and a looser, more ‘impressionist’ brush style. And, although he was cognizant of the example of Corot and Daubigny, he built his repertoire of compositions and favored sites quite independently of the two ‘old masters’ of river landscape, thus developing a very personalized color scheme. He is also one of the principal artists associated with the ‘school of Pontoise’, a group of young landscapists who painted primarily along the riverbanks of the Seine and Oise Rivers, north of Paris, often establishing homes in Pontoise. He also painted the river banks and upland plateaus of the Oise and Seine basins, worked frequently in Picardy and throughout the great Loire valley. He also made at least one trip to the Normandy coast. Exhibitions & Recognition Landscape with Thatched Cottage Damoye began to exhibit at the Salon of 1875 with a landscape titled L’hiver, and by 1879 he had won his first medal, a bronze or third class honor, beginning an unusually rapid rise for a landscape painter. In 1884 he received a second class medal, followed by a very prestigious gold medal at the grand, centennial Exposition Universelle (1889). He was inducted into the Légion d'honneur in 1893 and became a member of the Salon jury in 1900. Despite such official recognition, however, Damoye was instrumental in forming the break-away Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, a rival exhibition association, and he continued to be associated with the ‘Salon du Champ-de-Mars’ until his death in 1916.Dictionnaire des Petits Maitres de la Peinture 1820-1920, by Gerald Schurr & Pierre Cabanne, pg. 400 Death & Legacy Pierre Emmanuel Damoye died in 1916 and is buried in the famous Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, along with Frédéric Chopin, Marcel Marceau, Molière, Jim Morrison, Marcel Proust, Gertrude Stein, as well as fellow artists Eugène Delacroix, Max Ernst, Camille Pissarro, Jean-Baptiste- Camille Corot, Jacques-Louis David, Georges-Pierre Seurat. accessed on 7/29/10 Damoye's works can be seen in the Musée du Louvre, Paris; Musée d'Orsay, Paris; Musée des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux; Musée des Beaux-Arts, Troyes, France; and the National Museum of Art, Bucharest, Romania; Ateneum Art Museum, Helsinki. Given his skill and status among 19th Century artists, his works have also been highly sought by private collectors, resulting in an impressive record of successful auction transactions, including Christie's (New York, $30,000), Osenat (Paris, $11,470), Sotheby's (New York, $10,800), Beaussant Lefevre (Paris, $10,230), among others.http://www.artprice.com accessed 7/29/10 http://www.askart.com accessed 7/29/10 References Category:Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Artists from Paris Category:1847 births Category:1916 deaths ","title":"Pierre Emmanuel Damoye"},{"id":"28188716","text":"An example Mini-RF total radar backscatter image taken in the 12.6 cm band. It shows a fresh lunar impact crater with an ejecta blanket surrounding it. The Miniature Radio-Frequency instrument (Mini-RF) is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which is currently in orbit around the Moon. It has a resolution of 30 m/pixel and two wavelength bands, a primary band at 12.6 cm and a secondary band at 4.2 cm. The original principal investigator of Mini-RF, Stewart Nozette, was arrested for espionage. Nozette was replaced by Ben Bussey, then of APL, the Applied Physics Laboratory where Mini-RF was assembled from components developed by a consortium of industry team members. Bussey accepted a position at NASA Headquarters and was replaced by the current principal investigator, Wes Patterson, also of APL. Previous SAR instruments, such as the radar on the Magellan mission to Venus, were large, massive, power-hungry, and expensive. Intended as a demonstration of cheap, lightweight SAR technology, the Mini-RF instrument was designed in response to these concerns. Because it was a technology demonstration, Mini-RF is sometimes not included in lists of LRO's instruments. Radar is one of the few remote sensing tools capable of distinguishing water ice from other forms of water thought to be present of the Moon, such as hydrated minerals and water adsorbed onto the lunar surface. Although the LCROSS mission, which deliberately crashed a probe into the lunar surface to look for water, detected water in Cabeus Crater, Mini-RF did not detect the presence of thick deposits of water ice at the LCROSS impact site, however, the presence of less than 10 cm sized ice fragments could not be ruled out. In January, 2011, after completion of Mini-RF's primary mission objectives, NASA announced that the Mini-RF transmitter had suffered a critical failure. The receiver continues working, allowing occasional bistatic radar measurements, where the radar signal is transmitted from the Earth, reflected off the Moon, and received by the Mini-RF.

Opened in 1924, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. On October 7, 2019 it was gutted by fire, leading to its subsequent demolition. History The Jerusalem Temple Lodge #90 Masonic body was formed in Aurora, Illinois in October 1850, only 13 years after the city was founded. The first Worshipful Master was Benjamin Franklin Hall, who later became the first mayor of Aurora in 1857. They first met in the Main Street Building until moving into a Masonic Hall on Fox Street in 1866. The order moved again in 1910 to Broadway Street. The Masons quickly outgrew this building and desired to build a new temple at which to hold meetings. The body boasted almost a thousand members at this point, and they were easily about to raise over $200,000 for a new structure. Construction began on November 28, 1921, and the structure was opened on March 10, 1924. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 19, 1982. Sold by the lodge in the 1980s, the building was then used as a banquet facility. After the closure of that facility in 2006, the building suffered from deferred maintenance, resulting in water infiltration and damage to architectural features. Little is known about the architect, William Q. Bendus. The building was built in the Neo-classical style and may have been influenced by the Cleveland Museum of Art. The six-story Temple was situated on a hill and featured ionic columns. Masonic imagery adorned the tympanum. Two lodge rooms in the temple colud each seat over two hundred people. The original designs called for a ballroom, but this was never finished and was converted to a storage room. Other rooms in the building included a game room and kitchen. On October 7, 2019, the Aurora Masonic Temple sustained catastrophic damage from a fire; the remains were demolished several days later, but the columns and Masonic emblem from the west elevation were carefully dismounted for preservation.

These men were sent to Europe to record the activities of the American Expeditionary Forces.United States Army Center of Military History (CMH), Army Art Program History. In 1941, the Navy Combat Art Program was founded in order to ensure that competent artists would be present at the scene of history-making events. Eight active duty artists developed a record of all phases of World War II; and all major naval operations have been depicted by Navy artists. During the Korean War, the program was revived with two military artists in combat contexts. Since then, artists have been sent to other combat zones, including the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Army War Art Unit was established in late 1942; and by the spring of 1943, 42 artists were selected. In May 1943, Congress withdrew funding the unit was inactivated. The Army's Vietnam Combat Art Program was started in 1966. Teams of soldier-artists created pictorial accounts and interpretations for the annals of army military history. These teams of five soldier-artists typically spent 60 days of temporary duty (TDY) in Vietnam embedded with various units. The U. S. Army Center of Military History (CMH) currently includes an Army Art Collection with about 40 representative war artists. In 1992, the Army Staff Artist Program was attached to the United States Army Center of Military History. Army artists are a permanent part of the Museum Division's Collections Branch.

The center is situated on the Greater Temple Lot dedicated and purchased by Joseph Smith and his associates in 1831, only a few yards from the Church of Christ (Temple Lot)'s headquarters and the Community of Christ Temple. History The property upon which the Visitors' Center stands was first purchased on December 19, 1831 by Edward Partridge, acting on behalf of Smith. It was repurchased by the LDS Church, which had become the largest of several different Latter Day Saint denominations, on April 14, 1904.p. 19, Church chronology: a record of important events pertaining to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Deseret [News] Publishing, 1914 The purchase was completed by James G.

The portion owned by the Temple Lot church was the highest-altitude portion of the originally purchased by Partridge in December, 1831, and had been repurchased by Granville Hedrick, founder of the Temple Lot church, between 1867 and 1877. Both pieces of real estate are often confused, because since 1867 both the area and the larger area have been described in newspaper and other media reports as the \\"Mormon Temple Lot.\\"A 1975 edition of the Los Angeles Times mentions the Visitors' Center in a report headlined Independence to be ‘City of God’: Three Churches Await Christ in Missouri Independence to be ‘City of God’: Three Churches Await Christ in Missouri By Charles Hillinger, Los Angeles Times, p. 18, Saturday, March 29, 1975, at Google DocsAn article published in the LDS periodical the Ensign in 1979 and reproduced online today includes a photograph of the LDS visitors center in Independence, Center, and the cutline reads: \\"Independence Visitors’ Center, dedicated in 1971 on part of the temple lot\\": \\"The Way It Looks Today: A Camera Tour of Church History Sites in Missouri\\", Ensign, April 1979. A January 2009 online article by Community of Christ researcher John Hamer entitled \\"The Temple Lot: Visions and Realities\\" helps clear up the confusion. The Visitors' Center opened in 1971, the same year as another particularly notable LDS visitors'center in Nauvoo, Illinois. Its style of presenting LDS Church beliefs and doctrines in a modern audio-visual and interactive format was the brainchild of Bernard P. Brockbank, a church general authority, who had overseen implementation of the same style at the 1964 New York World's Fair. \\"Church readies pavilion for N.Y. Fair Inaugural\\" Deseret News, February 29, 1964 Theories on future use The Visitors' Center is alleged to have been designed after the Parthenon, one of the world's most renowned temples. This has fueled speculation as to whether the LDS Visitors' Center is, by definition, a temple constructed on the Greater Temple Lot dedicated and purchased by Smith and his associates for that purpose in 1831. An October 1952 Kansas City Times essay written by a friend and admirer of RLDS Church Historian Heman C. Smith (1850 – April 17, 1919)\\"Famous members of the Community of Christ formerly named the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS)\\"RLDS \\"Church Letter on Succession Authority\\" ref.

Tanner House, is a historic residence and museum in Aurora, Illinois. It was built in 1857 for William A. Tanner, a hardware merchant. His descendants lived in the house until it was donated to the Aurora Historical Society in 1936. It now operates as a Victorian-period historic house museum. History William A. Tanner was one of the first residents in Aurora, Illinois. He moved from Watertown, New York in 1835 shortly after Joseph and Samuel McCarty built the first mill in Aurora. Tanner was a land surveyor who noted the commercial potential of the Aurora area. He purchased a large tract of land on the west side of the river and invited his family, still in New York, to move in with him. For the next four years, Tanner harvested the land, until he briefly moved back to New York in 1839 to marry Anna Plum Makepeace. They moved back to Aurora the following year, working the farm until 1853. Together they had ten children; with this large family, Tanner required a larger house. After a few years living downtown, they moved to this house. Tanner now worked as a hardware businessman; his hardware firm stayed in business until 1979 and was the longest-running business in town.http://www.aurorahistory.net/tannertour.html?display=5 Tanner's house was constructed in the Italianate style in 1857. The two-story, brick house is built like a Latin Cross, with an octagon cupola at the center. The first floor features the parlor, music room, kitchen, dining room, library, and a master bedroom and bathroom. The second floor is exclusively bedrooms. The Tanner family (and their descendants) lived in the house until 1936, when two of the children donated it to the Aurora Historical Society. On August 19, 1976, it was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. It now operates as a museum. Tours run from June through late September. There is no admission fee, though donations are gratefully accepted. In addition, visitors are encouraged to come to the Tanner House on July 4 to celebrate Independence Day with various family activities that take place on the grounds, as well as in December as the home is decorated for the Christmas season.

Philippe. It explores the issues of filmmaking and fanaticism pertaining to the Star Wars franchise and its creator, George Lucas. The film combines filmmaker and celebrity interviews with fan films, mainly taken from the 2010 online video Star Wars Uncut, which were submitted via the film's site. Interviewees include a variety of figures such as Neil Gaiman, MC Frontalot and Gary Kurtz. Lucas appears frequently in archival footage, but is never interviewed directly. The film discusses the extent to which the Star Wars franchise is an artistic creation of Lucas and subject to his vision versus a social phenomenon that belongs to the general public of fans and their participatory/remix culture. The film is dedicated to interviewee Jason Nicholl, a blogger at nukethefridge.com who died before the film's release. The film was released on DVD on October 25, 2011. In June 2014, it was reported that a sequel was in development. Background and contents Director Alexandre Philippe, a lifetime Star Wars fan from his early childhood, has said that the film was not meant to be one-sided against Lucas, although the title has often created that interpretation. He instead aimed at showing both sides evenhandedly to explore to what extent the Star Wars franchise is controlled by Lucas versus something morally held by the public. Philippe feels that Lucas is a relatively talented director and an \\"ideas man\\" based on the original Star Wars trilogy, THX 1138 (1971) and American Graffiti (1973). However, Philippe disliked the changes made by Lucas in re-releases of the original trilogy as well as the prequel trilogy. Philippe thought that fans deserved a complete re-mastering and re-release of the original series in current formats (DVD, Blu-ray, etc.) without any changes. Philippe also stated that, to his knowledge, Lucas has never seen the documentary. However, Philippe has said that he would love to hold a private screening at Skywalker Ranch. The film begins with a brief history of Lucas' career leading up to the release of Star Wars in 1977. The rest of the film is structured by inter-cutting interviews with many different fans, academics, film critics, former colleagues of Lucas, well-known writers in the science fiction/fantasy genre and others. The narrative of the film shows the complex relationship between Lucas and his fans, as well as how and why exactly the elements of the Star Wars franchise have appealed to so many people so deeply. Critical reception On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 72%, based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The New York Post ran a positive review by Kyle Smith in which the film received three out of four stars. AMC critic Josh Bell wrote, \\"People is a skillfully edited, wide-ranging look at a subject that's very close to many movie fans' hearts, part of an ongoing debate that will only gain more attention as Lucas continues to tinker with his creations.\\" Independent critic Christian Toto praised the film and wrote that \\"the Force is strong with this one\\". Salt Lake City Weekly ran a negative review by Bryan Young, who commented that the \\"film comes off as a one-sided attack\\" and that it's \\"not hard to talk to people who love Star Wars... the filmmakers should have tried harder to provide that balance.\\" Slant Magazine writer Elise Nakhnikian lauded the film as \\"one of this year's best\\" documentaries, calling it \\"Smart, funny, and often impassioned.\\" On September 16, 2011, coinciding with the release of Star Wars on Blu-ray, Philippe appeared on a two-part episode of \\"Half in the Bag\\", an online movie review comedy show produced by RedLetterMedia. In the episode, Philippe is interviewed by Mike Stoklasa and Jay Bauman about the film and discusses his personal thoughts on Lucas and the franchise. On February 2, 2017, Mark Hamill stated during an interview that he felt that the documentary is biased against Lucas and the prequels and that he could not believe the backlash that they received. Sequel In June 2014 it was reported that a sequel, The People vs. George Lucas – Episode II, was in development. The film plans to examine what fans think of the Star Wars franchise since George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company, and will pose the question \\"What does the future of Star Wars look like without George Lucas?\\" See also *Cultural impact of Star Wars *RedLetterMedia reviews *Trekkies *Participatory culture *Remix culture References External links  * Category:2010 films Category:2010 comedy films Category:2010 documentary films Category:American films Category:Documentary films about fandom Category:English-language films Category:George Lucas Category:Star Wars documentaries ","title":"The People vs. George Lucas"},{"id":"28189065","text":"The Old Second National Bank of Aurora is a historic building in Aurora, Illinois.

The Prairie School style of design was, at this point, already a fading trend. Elmslie was nearing the end of his career and began to accept commissions for commercial buildings. Elmslie recruited sculptor Emil Settler, muralist John W. Norton, and sculptor Kristian Schneider to assist him with the design.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200167.pdf The bank building was a departure from previous Elmslie designs. Instead of focusing on horizontal patterns, this building attempted to integrate vertical patterns into a Prairie School design. The bank is built with Roman brick on a pink granite foundation. The building is topped with a saddleback roof with red tile. Ten brick columns rise from the foundation to the roof. Only the south side of the building features exterior details and ornaments. The narrow cornice is terra cotta and follows the gable. John Norton painted a three-panel mural of 1830s Aurora on the north side of the building's interior. A red tile floor was intended to resemble a large oriental rug. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1979.

The Art Deco building was originally a hospital and functioned as a nursing home and sanatorium until approximately April 2010, when the property was vacated. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 7, 2010. History The Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart came to the United States in 1876 following persecution of German Catholics during the Kulturkampf. Shortly afterward, the order moved to Joliet, Illinois, where they founded the St. Joseph Hospital. In February 1900, the rapidly growing order required a new hospital and convent to meet its needs. They purchased land in Aurora, a rapidly growing city nearby. They purchased the Coulter House on North Forth Street and used it as the first St. Charles Hospital. This became the second hospital in Aurora; the first was founded in 1886 by the Aurora City Hospital Association, who operated out of a building on Lincoln Avenue since 1888. The Franciscan order purchased the neighboring James Freeman House the next year, which then became the home of the hospital following a 1902 addition. As Aurora continued to grow, the Sisters needed to expand their space. They built a dormitory for sister in 1910 and a boiler house & laundry in 1920. The order founded a nursing school in 1922 and opened their first branch, a maternity hospital, in 1925. Recognizing the need for a large hospital building, the order began to purchase other houses on the block in the late 1920s. The St. Charles Hospital was built for the Sisters in 1932 for $500,000. It was designed in the Art Deco style by Wybe Jelles Van der Meer, who primarily planned ecclesiastical buildings and did most of his work for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockford. Construction was led by contractor C. J. DeWit, whose use of local labor during the Great Depression was lauded by the Chicago Daily Tribune. The 110-bed facility replaced the original complex as an acute care facility. Rev. Edward Francis Hoban gave the opening blessing. After years of service, the hospital became a skilled nursing facility and sanatorium as the Fox River Pavilion. Following the stabbing death of a patient, the state and federal government revoked the building's license in 2010. On June 7, 2010, the building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is located at The Barony, off Barony Road (at ). Built in 1779–80 to accommodate up to 350 people, the institution remained in use as a workhouse until 1930. For much of the remainder of the 20th century, the former workhouse became part of Barony Hospital, and is currently used as offices for the National Health Service. The former workhouse is listed at grade II. History George Wilbraham, a workhouse shareholder A building at the end of Beam Street, formerly the town house of the Mainwaring family, was used as the town's first workhouse and house of correction from 1677 to 1748; it stood on the site of the present Crewe Almshouses.Hall, pp. 124, 199, 207Garton, pp. 28–33, 41 The residential workhouse was replaced by 1748 by a set of three cottages on Queen Street (off Pillory Street), which housed up to 30 people in 1777.Hall, p. 226 The correction aspect of the Beam Street workhouse had earlier been assumed by a gaol house on Pillory Street, which was in existence by 1739. A poor rate of 6 pence in the pound was first recorded as being levied in Nantwich in 1732 for the support of the poor both in the workhouse and in their homes; the rate was collected between zero and five times a year. The present building was constructed in 1779–80 at the Barony on Beam Heath, which was then a common outside the town, on around 11½ acres of land donated by the Marquess of Cholmondeley.Hall, pp. 227–28Bagshaw's Directory (1850) A total of £450 towards the cost was raised from several existing charities; the remainder was funded by shares taken out by 31 local men, including Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton and George Wilbraham of Delamere. The new workhouse opened in June 1780. It was designed to accommodate 350 people, and took men, women and children. It was administered by a governor, the first being George or Charles Shrimpton; the governor's income in 1784 was £35 per year. John Howard, an early visitor Shortly after its foundation, the new workhouse is recorded as having a farm, dairy and gardens in which food was grown. Alvaston Farm (now demolished) stood immediately to the north of the workhouse, and might have provided food for the inhabitants.Lamberton & Gray, pp. 120–123 Records of the Nantwich overseers of the poor for 1780–85 survive, and show that meat, grain, vegetables, malt, wine, tobacco and snuff were all purchased. Children at the workhouse appear to have received some education at this time, as the purchase of copy and spelling books, easy readers, bibles and catechisms is also recorded. The prison reformer John Howard visited the workhouse on 1 August 1788, on which date it had only 44 inhabitants, and gave the following account of conditions: After the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, Nantwich Poor Law Union, formed on 18 February 1837, took over the existing workhouse. It then served 86 parishes and townships, with an elected governing board of 88 guardians. The workhouse building was expanded around this time, including the addition of a further storey. By 1850, the board had expanded to 93 guardians and, in addition to the governor, workhouse staff at that date included a matron, house surgeon, schoolmistress, chaplain and clerk. On 3 April 1881, there were 222 inhabitants. By 1892, the original workhouse building had been enlarged and was then used for 260 people.Kelly's Directory (1892) In 1914, there were 308 inhabitants and 18 officers, including a master, matron, chaplain, medical officer and dentist.Kelly's Directory (1914) Children's home and school In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several associated buildings were constructed adjacent to the workhouse. A children's home and school was built in 1879–80 at a cost of £3,300, which accommodated 60 children. In 1890–91, an infirmary was built at a cost of around £4,500, which provided 70 beds for poor patients; a woman's hospital was added in 1905 at a cost of £7,000, providing a further 70 beds. An adjacent nurses' home housed 15 nurses. Several buildings were added in 1894–96, including a ward for tramps, a mortuary and a steam laundry. =Barony Hospital= The Local Government Act of 1929 transferred the functions of workhouse boards to the local authority in 1930. The workhouse and its associated buildings were converted into a Public Assistance Institution, later known as Barony Hospital, with 124 beds, which treated poor people who were chronically sick. From 1935, the hospital was used for acute medical cases and as a maternity hospital, and also housed some patients with chronic illnesses. After the outbreak of the Second World War, the hospital was extended with 240 beds in huts; in 1963 there were 264 beds in total. Between 1948 and 1962, it was additionally used as a mental hospital. In 1982, the hospital was in use for geriatric and psychiatric patients, with 147 beds. Barony Hospital closed in 1994. Most of the former hospital buildings are still standing, although some wards housed in wooden huts near Middlewich Road were demolished in the 1990s to make way for an industrial estate. Description Workhouse, showing the east wing The former workhouse is a large three-storey building in red brick under a tiled roof. It has a U-shaped plan, with a long symmetrical front face and two long end wings which run away from the street.Pevsner & Hubbard, p. 289 The front face has a slightly projecting central bay, topped by a pediment bearing a clock face. The main entrance is to the central bay; it has a semicircular head with a fanlight, and is flanked by a pair of small windows. The front face has seven casement windows to the ground floor. In around 1971, the central bay had two Venetian windows with a semicircular head; only the second-storey one remains.Davies, p. 38 A bell tower and glazed porch to the main entrance have also been removed. Little of the original workhouse interior remains. Modern use The former workhouse building is currently used as offices for the National Health Service.

It was designed in 1932 by French architects Moncet and Reveron, and opened in 1938. Largely unused since abandonment of the railway during the later years of the Vietnam War, it was returned to a limited level of service in the 1990s with the reopening of a section of track leading to the nearby village of Trai Mat, operated as a tourist attraction. It is notable for its unique architectural style, which incorporates an overall Art Deco theme with elements of native Cao Nguyen communal houses from Vietnam's Central Highlands. History Construction of the Da Lat–Thap Cham Railway began in 1908, a decade after it had first been proposed by Paul Doumer, then Governor General of French Indochina, and proceeded in stages. Due to the difficulty of the mountainous terrain west of Sông Pha—where the Ngoan Muc Pass rose into the Central Highlands—construction proceeded slowly, requiring several rack railway sections and tunnels to be built. The railway was long, and rose almost along a winding route with three rack rail sections and five tunnels.Dalat–Song Pha Cog Railway Map / Vertical Map. From The railway tracks finally reached Da Lat in 1932, 24 years after construction had begun. Another railway station existed at the time, operated by the SGAI, a company that had managed the operation of the railway until that time.Old Station of Dalat. From The job of designing and constructing a new railway station to replace the old one was given to French architects Moncet and Reveron, who submitted a proposal designed by Reveron in 1932. The new station would follow the Art Deco style popular at the time, but would incorporate some characteristics of a Cao Nguyen communal house of Vietnam's Central Highlands, specifically with its high, steep roofs. Construction of the new station began in 1935, directly supervised by Moncet, and was completed three years later in 1938, becoming one of the first colonial-style buildings to be erected in the area. A JNR Class C12 steam locomotive at Da Lat railway station Throughout the Vietnam War, the Da Lat–Thap Cham line—as with the entire Vietnamese railway network—was a target of bombardments and sabotage. Relentlessly sabotaged and mined by the Viet Cong, the line gradually fell out of use, with regular operations coming to an end in 1968. Following the Fall of Saigon in April 1975, the railway was dismantled to provide materials for the repair of the main line. In the 1990s, however, a section of the line between Da Lat railway station and the nearby village of Trại Mát was restored and returned to active use as a tourist attraction. A 2002 planning document listed the restoration of the entire Da Lat–Thap Cham railway as a priority for infrastructure development for Da Lat and Lâm Đồng Province, including the upgrading of Da Lat railway station to handle passenger and cargo transportation. The proposed renewal received the backing of provincial and local governments, and the national government indicated that private companies would also be allowed to participate in the reconstruction of the railway. The project would also include a connection to the North–South Railway at Thap Cham, allowing trains to circulate between Da Lat and the rest of the country for the first time since the Vietnam War. In December 2009, four rail cars restored to look like the rail cars used on the Da Lat–Thap Cham line in the 1930s were put into use on the Da Lat–Trai Mat tourist railroad, carrying signage reading \\"Dalat Plateau Rail Road\\". Architecture The station's coloured glass windows Built in 1938, Da Lat railway station was designed in the Art Deco architectural style by French architects Moncet and Reveron, although it incorporates the high, pointed roofs characteristic of the Cao Nguyen communal buildings of ethnic minorities from Vietnam's Central Highlands. The three roofs, said to represent the three peaks of Dalat's iconic Lang Biang mountain, are also reminiscent of Normandy's Trouville-Deauville Station.Paradise by the Dashboard Light Under each roof is a multicoloured glass window, and under the central roof is a large clock, which has recently been restored. Inside the station, the elevated roofs create a raised ceiling. At the front of the station is a Porte-cochère, or coach gate, supported by two rows of twelve columns each. The station's unique design earned it recognition as a national historical monument in 2001.

Biography Born in Quebec City, Christian Lapointe studied theatre first in Moncton, New Brunswick. Later, he was admitted as a student in the acting program of Québec Conservatorium and studied as a director at the National Theatre School of Canada. In fall 2001, he staged a first triptych of short plays of William Butler Yeats and therefore appears as a curiosity in the Quebec theatre world. Following a co-production with a theatre institution in Hanoi and the staging of a second play of the Irish poet Yeats, he was admitted in 2003 to the development program for directors at the National Theatre School of Canada. After his schooling in 2006 he signed a mise en scène of Axël from Auguste Villiers de L'Isle-Adam. Over time he emerged as a restless figure in Quebec theatre due to the consistency and rigor of his approach. His works were presented among others at the National Arts Centre, in the official selection of the Festival d'Avignon and TransAmériques Festival. Free electron of Quebec theatre, he is the founder of Peril Theatre and co-artistic director of Théâtre Blanc. He was associate artist with Recto- Verso from 2011 to 2015. He completed his term for this organization in the spring of 2015 by giving himself a representation of almost 70 hours around the work of Antonin Artaud. Teacher, he regularly teaches in the École supérieure de théâtre of the Université du Québec à Montreal and at the National Theatre School of Canada.

Its causes include \\"exhaustion, sequestration, the mountain of evidence, and the desire to do the right thing\\". Jury stress can come as a result of seeing or hearing disturbing evidence. In the cases of murder or sexual crimes, evidence can be explicit causing potential harm to the jury. Jurors can also feel a 'burden of responsibility' - they hold large amounts of power over someone else's life and the possibility of imprisonment or a fine for that person. Jury stress could, in some cases, lead to symptoms of Post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and increased anxiety, depression or physical symptoms such as an increase in blood pressure or nausea.

It consists of an oceanic trench, the Hellenic Trench, on its outer side; two arcs—a non-volcanic outer arc and an inner volcanic arc, the South Aegean Volcanic Arc; and a marginal sea on its inner side. Geometry The Hellenic arc extends from the Ionian islands in the west to just east of the island of Rhodes in the east, where it links to the Cyprus arc. =Hellenic trench= The Hellenic ocean trench is not the surface expression of the subduction zone but is better understood as a sediment-starved part of a fore-arc basin. The Mediterranean Ridge, which forms the southern boundary of the trench is the accretionary complex that marks the subduction zone. The northern boundary of the Mediterranean Ridge is formed by a major backthrust. The Hellenic trench is most clearly developed in the western part of the arc, splitting into the Pliny and Strabo trenches to the east. =Non-volcanic arc= The non-volcanic arc consists of a raised topographic feature running the full length of the Hellenic arc, occasionally above sea level, forming the Ionian islands, Crete and Rhodes. This zone represents an uplifted part of the fore-arc. =Volcanic arc= The inner or volcanic arc extends for 450 km from Methana on the eastern coast of the Peloponnese in the west to the island of Nisyros off the Aegean coast of Turkey in the east. It consists of a series of dormant or active volcanic islands including Santorini, the site of the catastrophic Minoan-era eruption. Development The current geometry of the Hellenic arc is a result of the southwards migration of the subduction zone. This has led to extension both along the line of the arc as it bulged out and extension perpendicular to the arc, which is the current tectonic state. Seismicity The Hellenic arc is one of the most active seismic zones in western Eurasia. It has regularly been the source for magnitude 7 earthquakes in the last hundred years of instrumental recording and the location for at least two historical events that were probably of about magnitude 8 or more, the 365 Crete earthquake and the 1303 Crete earthquake.

The next book was Daylight Robbery another Vimal adventure of a Surender Mohan Pathak book. The Hindi crime thriller (:hi:पैंसठ लाख की डकैती, Painsatth Lakh ki Dacoity) Complete Review by M.A.Orthofer was first published in 1977. It was the 4th book in the Vimal series.Desi Cool The novel begun the trend of anti- heroism in Indian pulp fiction and was very controversial. Synopsis Vimal is blackmailed into joining a conspiracy to break into the vault of Bharat Bank at Amritsar to loot 6.5 million rupees (65 lakh) inside it.Review in Spintingler Magazine The conspiracy is the brainchild of Mayaram Bawa, a veteran vault-buster who is preparing to pull off the biggest heist of his career before he retires from his life of crime. For this purpose, he blackmails into submission an innocent-looking chauffeur called Vimal (whose actual name is Sardar Surender Singh Sohal), a criminal wanted for embezzlement in Allahabad (he didn't do it), murder of Lady Shanta Gokuldas in Bombay (he had to do it to prevent rape and death of a girl), the robbery of gate money at Anna Stadium Madras (he was blackmailed into it). Bawa's deal is straight—say no and go to jail or say yes and get his share. Bawa, with the help of Vimal and his partners Laab Singh (alias Matar Paneer) and Karamchand, successfully break into the vault and take away 6.5 million until an unfortunate circumstance forces them to flee the crime scene in a hurry. Having got the money (mainly due to Vimal's brilliant efforts), Bawa shows his true colours, running away with the entire loot and ruthlessly killing the innocent Karamchand and the jovial Laabh Singh \\"Matar Paneer\\". Vimal narrowly escapes being killed due to his presence of mind, but needs to trace down Bawa. The trail brings him face to face with Harnam Singh Grewal, the top gun of Punjab underworld and a ruthless giant of a man. Grewal gets wind of the robbery and starts searching for Mayaram Bawa to snatch the loot from him. Bawa takes refuge with his childhood friend Khanna, who is completely unaware of his criminal antecedents. Fearing capture by the police or being traced by Vimal (he is still unaware of Grewal's sinister designs), he leaves in a hurry. Grewal follows the trail to Khanna's residence, brutally murdering the man of the house and brutally torturing Mrs. Khanna. In the meanwhile, Vimal manages to trace Mayaram Bawa to the residence of a young lady named Neelam in Chandigarh. He finally catches Bawa and punishes him by breaking his legs. Bawa's life is spared due to mercy of Neelam, who is now in love with Vimal (the two eventually get married). The novel ends with Vimal entering the Khanna residence, where a bullet that hits him in the spine leaves Grewal paralysed neck down. Unfortunately, Grewal does not know where the money went as the only person who knew it was Mr. Khanna, who died after being brutal thrashed by him. With nothing left to gain, Vimal leaves the scene, leaving Grewal to the mercy of the humiliated Mrs. Khanna.

Knopf in the U.S. and by the Allen Lane imprint of Penguin in the U.K., Terror and Consent takes as its point of departure the perspectives Bobbitt developed in The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History. The book consists of an introduction, three parts, and a conclusion. Bobbitt argues most ideas about 21st-century terrorism are mistaken, and that \\"The wars against terror\\" comprise efforts against three dangers that threaten the legitimacy of the State: 1) \\"global, networked terrorists\\"; 2) \\"the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\"; and 3) catastrophes natural and \\"nonnatural.\\" As a historian, Bobbitt understands the contemporary problem of terrorism as part of \\"the transition from nation states to market states.\\" According to an argument he developed at length in The Shield of Achilles, the principle of legitimacy of the market state is \\"maximization of opportunities for . . . civil society and citizens.\\" It follows that protection of citizens is “the strategic raison d’être of the market state.\\" But despite limited successes, Bobbitt does not believe that the West is winning \\"the Wars against Terror,\\" in part because of a failure to rethink the relationship of strategy to law, two concepts that, in Bobbitt's view, can no longer be analyzed separately. The book's title derives from two new concepts he develops : States of terror and states of consent. Bobbitt argues that states are increasingly interdependent: \\"Realism, it seems, is increasingly unrealistic.\\" Reception Reviewers have emphasized the sweep and originality of Bobbitt's thinking. Niall Ferguson, in the New York Times Book Review, called Terror and Consent \\"a manifesto for a new Atlanticism\\" and \\"a reinvention of the dominant role of the trans-Atlantic alliance.\\"Niall Ferguson, \\"War Plans,\\" New York Times Book Review, April 13, 2008. Book review Conor Gearty found behind its \\"beguiling cosmopolitanism\\" traces of American exceptionalism: \\"many will balk at the assertion that the 'reason why the United States is not itself a terrorist state even though its warfare brings suffering and destruction to many innocent persons, including civilians, is that it acts within the law.'\\"Conor Gearty, \\"Why laws must trump wars,\\" Independent (London), May 23, 2008. Book review Rebecca Seal called Terror and Consent \\"fascinating\\" and \\"extraordinary,\\" and described the book as \\"a wide-ranging, frequently controversial and always opinionated treatise.\\"Rebecca Seal, \\"War--but not as we know it,\\" Guardian (London), June 15, 2008.

When a defendant exercises the right to request additional discovery, that is, information that the prosecutor is legally compelled to provide only upon the defendant's request, the prosecutor is allowed to request reciprocal discovery, obtaining certain information from the defendant that is comparable in nature to the information that the prosecutor must provide to the defendant.

Once reciprocal discovery is invoked, information that a defendant must disclose upon a prosecutor's request typically includes: * Witness lists, * Exhibit lists, * Access to physical evidence in the possession of the defendant for purpose of inspection and testing, and * Reports prepared by defense expert witnesses.

Conditions for resale royalty payments  * The artist at the time of the sale is a United States citizen or has been a California resident for at least two years. * The seller resides in California or the sale takes place in California. * The work is an original painting, drawing, sculpture or original work of art in glass. * The work is sold by the seller for more money than she or he paid. * The work is sold for a gross price of more than $1,000 or is exchanged for one or more works of art or for a combination of cash, other property, and one or more works of fine art with a fair market value of more than $1,000. * The work is sold during the artist's lifetime or within 20 years of the artist's death. The act does not apply if: * The sale is the initial sale of the work and the legal title of the work at the time of such initial sale is vested in the artist. * The resale of fine art is by an art dealer to a purchaser within 10 years after the initial sale by the artist to an art dealer, provided that all intervening sales are between art dealers. * The sale consists of a work of stained glass artistry permanently attached to real property and it was sold as part of the sale of the real property to which it was attached.  Requirements under the act for qualifying works  When the sale of a work meets the conditions outlined above, a seller must pay the artist 5% of the resale price. If the artist is deceased, the payment goes to the artist's estate or heirs. It is the seller's obligation to locate the artist within 90 days of the sale. If the artist or heirs cannot be located, the seller is to make payment to the California Arts Council, who will hold the collected payments for up to 7 years for the artist. In the event that the Council is unable to locate a particular artist or the artist fails to claim the collected royalties in that time period, the funds collected are distributed to the city of Sacramento's Art in Public Places program. The artist's right to receive the royalty cannot be waived in full; it can only be modified by written contract providing for a royalty payment in excess of the 5% of resale value that is required by the Act.  History of the resale right  California's Resale Royalty Act was signed into law in 1976. The resale right has its origins in the French law droit de suite, first enacted in 1920, which provided French artists the right to receive a royalty from resales of their work.\\"The Droite de Suite: Why American Fine Artists Should Have a Right to a Resale Royalty.\\" Loyola of Los Angeles Entertainment Law Review. March 1, 1995. Vol. 15, Page 10. The droite de suite reflects both the idea that artists have certain moral rights in their works (such as the inalienable right to be associated with their works) and the economic concern that artists often are unable to benefit from the full value of their works, where they have low bargaining power in initial sales or where their works appreciate significantly in value after the first sale.\\"A Right Deferred:Resale Royalties for Visual Artists.\\" Law Student Connection, February 17, 2012. As of 2012, over 60 countries across the world recognize some version of the resale right.\\"Resale Royalty Right.\\" Copyright Office, Notice of Inquiry. Federal Register Vol. 77 No. 182, page 58177. = Berne Convention = The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works of 1886 included a droite de suite provision in Article 14ter in its 1948 revision. This article provided for a general recognition of a resale right among signatory countries, but included the stipulation that protection provided by such recognition \\"may be claimed in a country of the Union only if legislation in the country to which the author belongs so permits, and to the extent permitted by the country where this protection is claimed.\\" = United States = Currently, California is the only state that recognizes the resale right. The Copyright Office conducted a study,http://www.copyright.gov/history/droit_de_suite.pdf published in 1992, evaluating the nature of the resale right and the possibility of adopting a federal droite de suite. The Copyright Office concluded in the report that there were not adequate economic or copyright policy justifications to warrant adopting droite de suite at the federal level. The report did indicate that should the EU harmonize its droit de suite laws and extend the resale right to all member states, Congress may at that point revisit the resale right issue. Legislation was proposed in both the Senate (S.2000) and the House (H.R. 3688) in December 2011 that would provide for a national resale royalty right. The Equity for Visual Artists Act of 2011 (EVAA) would provide for a 7% royalty to be collected from sales of certain works of art where the sale price exceeded $10,000. Half of this payment would go to the artist or successor in copyright, and half would go towards an escrow account to support U.S. non- profit museums. Both pieces of legislation are currently in committee. In conjunction with the consideration of the legislation, in September 2012 Congress published a Notice of Inquiryhttp://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr58175.pdf requesting comments from the public on factual and policy matters relating to a possible federal resale royalty right.  Legal challenges  =Constitutionality as applied to out-of-state sales= The Resale Royalty Act came under legal scrutiny when, in October 2011, a group of artists and their heirs filed class action suits against auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's, and auction site eBay, for failure of those brokers to pay royalties per the Resale Act. In a decisionhttp://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/c1e5a8ee236d7ae988257a02007034b6/$FILE/8604.pdf on May 17, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen dismissed the suits on the grounds that the Resale Royalty Act violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and was therefore invalid as law (Estate of Graham, et al, v. Sotheby's Inc.). The Commerce Clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as not only affirmatively granting to Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, but also, by negative implication, prohibiting the states from unjustifiably discriminating against or burdening the flow of interstate commerce. A state regulation violates the Commerce clause where it \\"directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State.\\" Judge Nguyen found that where the act regulates any transaction in which the seller resides in California, regardless of the location of the sale, buyer, or artist, the Resale Royalty Act \\"explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art occurring wholly outside California.\\" The Court cited the example of a California resident placing a painting by a New York artist for sale with Sotheby's in New York, where at the subsequent auction the painting is bought by a New York resident. In this instance, the California law requires the New York company to withhold the amount of the royalty from the sale price, and either locate and pay the artist in New York or remit payment to the California Arts Council should the artist not be located. Further, the Act permits the New York artist to sue the New York Sotheby's under California law should the auction house fail to collect and remit the applicable royalty to the artist. In 2015, an eleven-judge en banc panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that applying the Act to out-of-state sales made by a California resident was unconstitutional.Sam Francis Foundation, et al. v. Christies, Inc, et al., no. 12-56067 (9th Cir. May 5, 2015) The court struck the clause \\"the seller resides in California or\\" from the Act, declining to rule on whether the Act could otherwise be applied to sales made within California.

The FPA allows community vessels from 11 Member States to fish in Moroccan waters and can be considered as one of the major fisheries agreement for the EC. It was signed on 28 July 2005, concluded on 22 May 2006 and entered into force on 28 February 2007. The agreement is set to expire on 27 February 2011.Europa.eu The agreement provides for the granting of 119 fishing licenses for Community vessels (mostly Spanish, but also from other EU countries) and for a total of 6000 tonnes of pelagic fish for industrial fishing by vessels from France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Spain. In exchange, the EU is to pay Morocco a financial contribution of 144 million €, plus around 13.6 million € to be paid as fees by the shipowners.Enrico Milano, \\"The new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco: fishing too south?\\", Anuario Espagnol de Derecho Internacional, vol XXII, 2006 The agreement is less ambitious than its predecessors, both in terms of financial contribution and of number of licenses and of pelagic species included. In particular, it excludes the fishing of valuable cephalopods and crustaceans, reflecting the concern of Morocco for the depletion of its fishing stocks, and its efforts to develop its own industrial fishing fleet (by 2006, Morocco was already the top fish exporter in Africa). The geographic scope of application of the FPA is controversial; its extension to Western Saharan waters is considered by many to entail a violation of international law. Morocco has occupied the larger part of Western Sahara since 1975,FPIF and controls the waters offshore the territory. Since Moroccan stocks are largely depleted, the bulk of the fisheries nowadays takes place offshore Western Sahara.Agence du Sud  Historical background  Large-scale fishing from mainland Spain in Moroccan waters began in the 1960s, with the expansion of the Spanish fishing industry, especially from Galicia. The 1975 Tripartite Agreement between Spain, Morocco and Mauritania (Madrid Agreement) included a commitment by Morocco not to impair the access of Spanish fishermen to the waters of Western Sahara. A first fisheries treaty signed in 1977 between Morocco and Spain never entered into force; a second was signed in 1983 and foresaw two different areas of application, north and south of Cape Noun, thus designating the latter as Western Saharan waters, in order not to imply a recognition of Moroccan sovereignty. The accession of Spain and Portugal in the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986 led to an exclusive EC competence on fisheries, also in its external relations. The first fisheries agreement between the EC and Morocco was signed in 1988. The 4-year agreement provided 800 annual licenses for Spanish and Portuguese trawlers, and contained no restrictions on quantities or species. In return Morocco received 282 million Euro. The 1992 EC-Moroccan Fisheries Agreement provided better conditions for Morocco in terms of financial compensation (310 million Euro) and longer biological rest periods. Yet disagreements over license use led an early termination of the agreement in April 1995. The 1992–95 agreement, in its Annex I, mentioned the port of Dakhla, thus indicating the inclusion of Western Sahara in its geographical scope. A modified agreement was signed in November 1995. Financial compensation now amounted to 355 million Euros, of which a substantial part was earmarked for the development of the industrial fisheries sector, marine research and the training of Moroccan fishermen. When the agreement expired in November 1999, Morocco opposed renewal because it wanted to prevent total exhaustion of fish stocks. This created problems for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets, who had always been the main beneficiaries of fishing licenses under the European Community's fisheries agreements with Morocco. Both had to undergo a process of restructuring and downscaling. There was no agreement into force until this new fisheries partnership agreement initialled in July 2005.Medea  Geographical scope of application  The geographic scope of application of the FPA is controversial; its extension to Western Saharan waters is considered by many to entail a violation of international law. According to art. 2(a) of the agreement, EU fisheries can take place in \\"the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco\\", as it was defined also in all previous agreements. It does therefore not limit itself to the area under direct sovereignty of the Moroccan authorities, but includes further areas under its jurisdiction, e.g. its maritime exclusive economic zone but also the waters of Western Sahara. As such, the agreement neither includes nor excludes explicitly the waters of Western Sahara The agreement came under fire for failing to specify the southern limit of Morocco in its geographical scope. Opponents of the agreements feared that this would allow Morocco to issue licenses to European vessels to fish in the waters of Western Sahara, the former Spanish colony that was invaded by Morocco in 1975.European Voice The territorial ambiguity led Sweden to vote against the agreement in the EU Council, stating that \\"Western Sahara is not part of the territory of Morocco under international law and a process is under way to find a just, lasting and mutually accepted political solution to the conflict\\". Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands agreed with the Swedish position, but did not vote against the deal, opting instead to abstain.BBC These countries did issue separate statements, outlining their concerns.  Compliance with international law  = 2002 UN legal opinion = In 2002, the UN Legal Counsel had stated that natural resources activity in Western Sahara can only take place in accordance with the wishes and interests of the people of the territory.UN democracy In 2008, the author of the UN Opinion heavily criticised the EU for having misused his analysis to adopt the FPA, an agreement which is in violation of international law.HAVC.se The UN Opinion was echoed in the legal opinion delivered by the European Parliament’s legal services in 2009, which concluded that Saharawi people have not been consulted in relation to the FPA and that there is no proof that they are benefiting from it, as international law demands. = Legal opinions of the EU institutions = The compatibility of the agreement with international law has been the object of two legal opinions prepared by the legal services of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union. The Parliament's opinion has been released (though partially), while the Council's remains unpublished. According to the legal services of the European Parliament, the agreement does neither include nor exclude the waters of Western Sahara from its geographical scope, and it would thus be up to Morocco to comply with its international obligations. The European Community could eventually suspend the agreement, if Morocco was found disregarding the interests of the people of Western Sahara. Notwithstanding the positive legal opinion, a large minority in the European Parliament asked for the explicit exclusion of Western Sahara from the geographical scope of the agreement. Finally, the Parliament adopted the treaty, asking the Council to strengthen the monitoring mechanisms. The written opinion of the legal services of the Council of the European Union, though not made public, reportedly arrives at the same conclusions as the one of the Parliament. In the Council's vote, Sweden voted against and Finland abstained. No amendment requested by the Parliament was adopted. = Claims of lack of legal validity with regards to Western Sahara =  For lack of competence of Morocco to conclude an agreement on Western Sahara's fisheries  According to Enrico Milano, the validity of the agreement concerning the waters of Western Sahara is viciated, since Morocco does not have sovereignty over such territory, is not an administering Power, nor does its presence find other legal justifications (e.g. consent by the former administrative power Spain, by the UN Security Council, or by the Saharawi people). Western Sahara remains considered by the UN as a non-self governing territory (NSGT), and Spain did not intend (nor could) transfer the competence of administering Power to Morocco and Mauritania with the 1976 tripartite Madrid Agreement. As stated by the ICJ in the East Timor case, \\"a state occupying a NSGT without a proper legal basis lacks legal capacity to create international legal rights and obligations concerning that territory\\" Even in the unlikely scenario that Morocco was to be considered the new administering power, the principle of self-determination of peoples restricts the colonial power to enter into treaties concerning the territory once a process of national liberation has startedcf. Arbitral Tribunal, Affaire de la délimitation de la frontière maritime entre la Guinée-Bissau et le Sénégal. Milano, p.14 The lack of sovereignty and of administering Power status of Morocco for what concerns Western Sahara was noticed also by the legal opinion of the European Parliament, which nevertheless failed to conclude for the lack of competence of Morocco to conclude an agreement with the EU on the issue. In 2006, the EU Commissioner for fisheries, Mr. Borg, referring to the UN legal opinion, stated that \\"agreements can be concluded with the Kingdom of Morocco concerning the natural resources of Western Sahara\\" since the UN legal opinion \\"implies that Morocco is a de facto administrative power ... and consequently has the competence to conclude such type of agreement\\".Milano 2006, p. 16 According to Milano, the Commission underestimated the difference between the object of the UN legal opinion, concerning contracts with foreign companies for oil and explorations, and the nature of the FPA, an international agreement not assimilable to a contract, requiring a different and stronger competence by Morocco.  For violation of the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources as applied to NSGTs  According to Enrico Milano, a second legal ground for the lack of validity of the FPA with regards to its extension to Western Saharan waters lies in the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources. This principle entails the obligation that economic activities related to the NSGT should be carried out in accordance with both the wishes and the interests of its people.1995 General Assembly resolution entitled \\"Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories\\" The EU legal opinions, though arguing that rules of international law should be respected also by the EC when exercising its powers in place of its member states, enact a very narrow reading of the right of the people of Western Sahara and of the corresponding obligations of third parties, identifying Morocco as the main bearer of obligations towards the Western Sahara people and stating that it cannot be presumed that Morocco will not comply with them. According to Milano, since fishing is carried out by European vessels and since the Community has an active role in allowing this economic activity, by directly asking Morocco the issuance of licenses, the EU is directly bound to respect its international obligations owed to the people of that territory, when entering into a fishing agreement extending to a NSGT.Milano, p. 17-18 To be valid according to the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources, therefore, the agreement should be conducted for the interest of the local (Saharawi) people and according to their wishes, as expressed by their legitimate representatives (the Polisario and the SADR government). This was also the opinion of Sweden during the EU Council vote. Lacking this element, the FPA cannot be considered valid for what concerns the territory of Western Sahara.  Consequences  For the reasons above, Milano finds that \\"the FPA may be found invalid to the extent that it intends to create international rights concerning the use of fisheries in the Western Sahara's waters\\". This would imply that the EU cannot rely on the FPA to request the issuing of fishing licenses for Western Saharan waters, that Morocco cannot oppose it to the EU to complain about fishing conducts in Western Saharan waters, and that the EU cannot oppose the FPA as binding to a future Western Saharan administration.Milano 2006, p. 14-15 = Applicability of the duty of non-recognition = The FPA has been challenged by legal scholars also concerning a possible breach by the European Union of the duty of non- recognition of situations resulting from a serious violation of peremptory norms of international law. For what concerns whether the duty of non- recognition is binding also upon international organisations, these are bound as much as States are, to respect such a duty of non-recognition,artt. 40 and 41 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the European Court of Justice has recognised that the Community is bound to respect customary international law.cases Poulsen and Racke Moreover, even if member states have no subsidiary responsibility for the action of and international organisation with its area of exclusive competence, they do have a separate responsibility for breach of obligation incumbent upon them when acting within intergovernmental bodies, in terms of their individual conduct at the time of voting. In the case of the FPA any good faith exemption would be rejected due to the clear unwillingness by the EU institutions to exclude explicitly Western Sahara from the geographical scope of the agreement. For what concerns whether the duty of non-recognition applies to Morocco's de facto administration of Western Sahara, such a duty holds for situations of e.g. attempted acquisition of sovereignty over territory through the denial of the right of self-determination of peoples, and includes treaty relations between third states and countries purporting to act on behalf of or concerning the occupied or annexing territory.ICJ Namibia advisory opinion Moreover, the duty of non-recognition arises independently from the action of the UN Security Council, so that any third party has to make its own assessment about it. According to Enrico Milano, if the FPA was to be extended in practice to the waters of Western Sahara, the EC action may also be found in violation of its obligation of non-recognition.Milano 2006, p. 21-23 The extension of the FPA's territorial scope to Western Sahara represents an act of implied recognition by the Union of an unlawful territorial situation representing a continuing violation of ius cogens norms since over thirty years.Milano 2006, p. 31 = EC practices necessary to ensure the legality of its conduct under international law = In the Ali Yusuf case, the ECJ uphold that EU Law should be interpreted, and eventually limited in its scope, in the light of the relevant rules of international law. According to Enrico Milano, in order to remain in compliance with international law, the FPA should be limited to the territorial waters of Morocco proper, excluding Western Sahara, as already upheld by the Commission previously, in 1988: \\"the extent of these waters must be determined in accordance with international law\\".Milano 2006, p. 30 At the end, it is up to the EU not to seek licenses from Morocco for fishing in Western Sahara's waters.Milano 2006, p. 32  Notes and references   See also  * Morocco–European Union relations  External links  * Text of the 2006 EU-Moroccan Fisheries Partnership Agreement * Enrico Milano, \\"The new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco: fishing too south?\\", Anuario Espagnol de Derecho Internacional, vol XXII, 2006 Category:2007 in the environment Category:Fisheries treaties Category:Policies of the European Union Category:Fishing in the European Union Category:Economy of Morocco Category:Treaties concluded in 2006 Category:Treaties entered into force in 2007 Category:Treaties entered into by the European Union Category:Treaties of Morocco ","title":"EU–Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement"},{"id":"28189501","text":"Petroleum University or University of Petroleum may refer to: *China University of Petroleum, Dongying, Shandong *Federal University of Petroleum Resource Effurun, Delta State, Nigeria *King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia *Liaoning University of Petroleum and Chemical Technology, Fushun, Liaoning, China *Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University, Raisan, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India *Petroleum University of Technology, Abadan, Iran *Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China *University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India *Ufa State Petroleum Technological University, Ufa, Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia ","title":"Petroleum University"},{"id":"28189517","text":"Rakta Sambandham () is a 1962 Telugu-language drama film directed by V.

Plot  Rajasekhar \\"Raju\\" becomes the guardian to his younger sister Radha after their parents' death. The brother-sister duo love, care and adore each other and are inseparable. He works at a local mill run for daily wages. One day, Radha is injured in an accident and Anand, Raju's co-worker at the mill, tends to her injuries. Raju is happy to know this and befriends Anand. When the mill is shut down due to a labour problem, Radha gives a depressed Raju one thousand rupees which she had saved earlier. She advises him to use this money as seed capital and commence his own toy business. Raju follows her advice, starts a business and buys the mill. Anand, who returned to the city after a legal dispute at his village, is jobless and approaches Raju for work. Raju appoints him in his concern and over a period of time, Anand and Radha fall in love. Raju, who is very possessive of his sister, gets angry with Anand as he feels betrayed. However, knowing how intensely Radha loves Anand, he arranges for their wedding. After the marriage, Anand, along with his aunt Kanthamma and cousin Apparao, move into Raju's house. Raju marries Malathi, a doctor, on Radha's suggestion. All of them continue to live under the same roof and several misunderstandings arise. Kanthamma uses every opportunity to widen the rift between the couples. Unable to witness Radha's troubles, Raju moves out of the house with his wife. Kanthamma serves a legal notice to Raju, demanding a share in the property for Radha. Meanwhile, Anand contests against Raju in the local government elections. To avoid further issues, Raju withdraws his nomination. Still the families do not unite. Radha delivers a boy and Malathi delivers a girl. After her child's birth, Malathi dies, leaving Raju heartbroken. Anand goes to meet Raju, but is expelled by Malathi's brother Bhaskar, who holds him responsible for his sister's plight. Unable to cope with the separation from his sister and to have peace of mind, Raju goes on a pilgrimage for several months. He donates the entire property to Radha and sends the papers through a lawyer before leaving. Raju returns on Diwali day and goes to meet Radha, but is denied entry by Kanthamma. While going back, he saves a boy from getting burnt by fire crackers and in the process, loses his eyesight. Through Subbanna, Radha learns that Raju had arrived and rushes to meet him. Raju learns that the child he saved is none other than his nephew. Anand, who learned about Kanthamma's misdeeds from Apparao, expels her from his house and goes to meet Raju.

They decided to remake it in Telugu for their production company Rajalakshmi Productions, but were skeptical of the film's success, as it had a very tragic story. After a delay, Nahata revived the plans and signed V. Madhusudhan Rao to direct the film. Doondi signed writer Mullapudi Venkata Ramana to work on the script. His decision was met with severe criticism, as Ramana was known for his humorous works. Ramana took it as a challenge and completed working on the film's script and shot division in a span of two weeks. To tone down the melodrama in the original, Ramana introduced two characters from his fiction works: Apparao, the chronic debtor and his love interest Sita. Both were the subject of Ramana's friend, collaborator and filmmaker Bapu paintings. = Cast and crew = Savitri was cast as the female lead, reprising her role from Pasamalar. Nahata approached Akkineni Nageswara Rao to play the male lead, but Nageswara Rao politely rejected the proposal, saying that the audience would not accept him play Savitri's brother, given their reputation as an on-screen romantic pair. Doondi approached N. T. Rama Rao for the same, who accepted the proposal. Kanta Rao was signed as the other male lead, played by Gemini Ganesan in the original. Devika, M. Prabhakar Reddy and Suryakantham were cast in key supporting roles. Relangi and Girija were chosen to play Apparao and Sita respectively, and Ramana Reddy was cast as the latter's father. K. V. S. Sarma and Y. V. Raju played minor roles as the factory owner and servant Subbanna respectively. Nahata and Doondi were impressed with Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy soundtrack and score for the original, and approached them to work on the remake. They expressed their inability due to scheduling conflicts, and instead suggested Ghantasala name. Doondi signed Ghantasala as the film's music composer. C. Nageswara Rao served as the director of photography, and N. S. Prakasham edited the film. Krishna Rao was the film's art director. = Filming = Rakta Sambandham was majorly filmed in sets erected at Golden Film Studios and Vijaya Vauhini Studios, where the post- production activities were carried out. Doondi and Nahata wanted to wrap the film within a restricted budget. According to Madhusudhan Rao, Rakta Sambandham was physically and mentally demanding for Savitri, though she played the same role in the original. Savitri avoided using glycerol during emotional scenes and preferred method acting. As a result, she had swollen eyes and fainted on sets often. Shooting was cancelled at times due to Savitri's illness. Suryakantham, who played the role of an abusive mother-in- law, could not bear watching Savitri struggle and used to forget her lines. She expressed her helplessness to Madhusudhan Rao and wished to walk out of the film, until Rama Rao intervened and requested to reconsider her decision. While filming an emotional scene, film producer Aluri Chakrapani visited the sets. He suggested Rama Rao to act in a subtle way; he stated that the Telugu audience would not appreciate melodramatic performances. The song \\"Yevaro Nannu Kavvinchi\\" was filmed on Kanta Rao and Savitri at Kodaikanal.  Music  Ghantasala composed the film's soundtrack and background score. He was initially apprehensive about the songs as all of them were situation based, and that Viswanathan's music received critical acclaim. With Nahata's encouragement, he composed new tunes for all the songs except two, which were retained from the original: \\"Chanduruni Minchu\\" and \\"Bangaru Bomma Raaveme\\". Aarudhra, Anisetty Subbarao, C. Narayana Reddy, Daasarathi Krishnamacharyulu and Kosaraju Raghavaiah collaborated for the lyrics. The soundtrack was marketed by HMV Records and was released on 1 December 1962. The soundtrack received positive reviews. Venkat Rao, in his review for Andhra Jyothi dated 9 November 1962, stated that Ghantasala's music was instrumental in taking the film to the next level, and praised the lyrics for the songs \\"Manchi Roju Vastundi\\", \\"Bangaru Bomma Raaveme\\" and \\"Yevaro Nannu Kavvinchi\\". Radha Krishna, writing for Andhra Prabha on 11 November 1962, opined that Ghantasala's music was \\"uplifting\\" and praised the lyricists for their contribution. Visalaandhra, in its review dated 11 November 1962, noted the songs \\"Idhe Rakta Sambandham\\", \\"Chanduruni Minchu\\" and \\"Bangaru Bomma Raaveme\\" as the finest among others in the film's soundtrack.  Release  Rakta Sambandham was released on 1 November 1962, with an approximate total length of in 17 reels, and a running time of 144 minutes. The film's distribution rights were acquired by East India Film Company Private Limited. While Savitri was skeptical of the film's success owing to its melodramatic nature, Rama Rao expressed his confidence citing Ramana's screenwriting as the film's strength. Rakta Sambandham was a commercial success, completing a 100-day run in 11 centers and over 25 weeks in Vijayawada, making it a silver jubilee film. During Rama Rao's tenure as the Chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Rakta Sambandham was re-released in 1988, and completed a 100-day run in Hyderabad.  Reception  The film received positive reviews from critics. Venkat Rao, in his review for Andhra Jyothi dated 9 November 1962, praised the performances of the film's cast, especially those of Rama Rao, Savitri and Kanta Rao. Venkat Rao also praised Ramana's screenplay and the emotional climax, but found the inclusion of a dance number in the second half as an unwanted addition. Radha Krishna, writing for Andhra Prabha on 11 November 1962, termed the performances of Rama Rao and Savitri as \\"extraordinary\\", and praised Ramana for his spontaneity in the dialogues. Visalaandhra, in its review dated 11 November 1962, found Rama Rao's performance in the second half more effective and moving than the one he delivered in Kalasi Vunte Kaladu Sukham (1961). The reviewer noted that the film was \\"technically sound\\" with profound writing by Ramana and deft handling by Madhusudhan Rao.  Legacy  Rakta Sambandham made a significant impact on the on-screen image of Rama Rao and Savitri. The portraits of the actors used in the film later gained wide recognition and were used in public gatherings on multiple occasions. During its theatrical run, the film influenced many Telugu households to celebrate brother-sister bonding. As a mark of gratitude to Doondi, Ramana dedicated his book Cineramaneeyam Part I to him. After Rakta Sambandham, Rama Rao and Savitri acted as a romantic couple in P. S. Ramakrishna Rao Aatma Bandhuvu (1962). Its commercial success encouraged Rama Rao to experiment further with his on-screen image.

It is a strongly regular graph, a distance-transitive graph, and a Ramanujan graph. Although its construction is folklore, it was named after Andries Brouwer and Willem H. Haemers, who proved its uniqueness as a strongly regular graph. Construction The Brouwer–Haemers graph has several related algebraic constructions. One of the simplest is as a degree-4 generalized Paley graph: it can be defined by making a vertex for each element in the finite field GF(81) and an edge for every two elements that differ by a fourth power. Properties The Brouwer–Haemers graph is the unique strongly regular graph with parameters (81, 20, 1, 6). This means that it has 81 vertices, 20 edges per vertex, 1 triangle per edge, and 6 length-two paths connecting each non- adjacent pair of vertices. As a strongly regular graph with the third parameter equal to 1, the Brouwer–Haemers graph has the property that every edge belongs to a unique triangle; that is, it is locally linear. Finding large dense graphs with this property is one of the formulations of the Ruzsa–Szemerédi problem. As well as being strongly regular it is a distance- transitive graph. History Although Brouwer writes that this graph's \\"construction is folklore\\", and cites as an early reference a 1964 paper on Latin squares by Dale M. Mesner, it is named after Andries Brouwer and Willem H. Haemers, who in 1992 published a proof that it is the only strongly regular graph with the same parameters. Related graphs The Brouwer–Haemers graph is the first in an infinite family of Ramanujan graphs defined as generalized Paley graphs over fields of characteristic three. With the 3\\\\times 3 Rook's graph and the Games graph, it is one of only three possible strongly regular graphs whose parameters have the form \\\\bigl((n^2+3n-1)^2,n^2(n+3),1,n(n+1)\\\\bigr). It should be distinguished from the Sudoku graph, a different 20-regular 81-vertex graph. The Sudoku graph is derived from Sudoku puzzles by making a vertex for each square of the puzzle and connecting two squares by an edge when they belong to the same row, column, or 3\\\\times 3 block of the puzzle. It has many 9-vertex cliques and requires 9 colors in any graph coloring; a 9-coloring of this graph describes a solved Sudoku puzzle. In contrast, for the Brouwer–Haemers graph, the largest cliques are the triangles and the number of colors needed is 7.

Breakfast is underway at the Arable house, but when Fern and Avery ask why Pa was up late last night, discover the newborn pigs, and that he is planning to kill one, Fern runs to save it (\\"Breakfast At The Arables\\"). He finally gives in and lets her keep the pig, and Ma goes in the house to find a baby bottle while Pa and Avery follow. Ma asks Fern what she plans to name the pig, and she decides to name it Wilbur (\\"Wilbur\\"). She goes inside for breakfast while Wilbur eats his own (\\"Eating\\"). Pa then decides Wilbur needs to be sold, and he is bought by the Zuckermans. He is quickly welcomed to the barn by all the animals, (\\"Nice To Meet You\\"). That night he is lonely and hears a voice claiming to be his friend. She says she will introduce herself in the morning. The next day he is shocked to find his new friend is a spider named Charlotte, but he doesn't mind (\\"Who Says We Can't Be Friends?\\"). Edith and Homer Zuckerman are going over 'Honey Do Lists' when they decide to put the work off until fall (\\"Summer\\"). The barnyard animals soon begin talking to Wilbur, and he learns his fate. Charlotte vows to save him; that night she carries out her plan (\\"Charlotte's Spinning Song\\"). The next day he sees an opportunity to run away, and the animals advise him to do so. But Charlotte warns he will die in the wild (\\"Freedom Now!). After the chase, everyone takes notice of the words 'Some Pig' in her web (\\"Some Pig\\"). The animals are thinking of a new word to put in the web and they come up with 'Terrific'. Charlotte works on it (\\"As The Day Went On\\"). The next day, Ma and Fern come down to see it, and have a heart to heart (\\"Mama, You Don't Understand Me\\"). The reporters and townspeople notice and pressure Homer to take Wilbur to the County Fair. He gives in (\\"County Fair\\"). =Act II= The townspeople are at the fair (\\"County Fair (Reprise)\\"). Fern and Avery soon want to go off by themselves, But the parents give them a list of don'ts. After they leave, Fern and Avery mock them (\\"Don't\\"). Charlotte and Wilbur are now comfortable in his stall, but when he sees the pig next door, he is worried. Charlotte reassures him that it will be fine (\\"You're You\\"). She then writes another word in her web to get him more attention (\\"Charlotte at Work\\"). When she is finished, she has written the word 'Humble'. The next day everyone is sad to find that the pig next door has won the blue ribbon. But their spirits are lifted when Wilbur wins a special medal (\\"Wilbur (Reprise)\\"). When it is time to leave, Charlotte cannot leave, because she is dying. Wilbur takes her egg sack to hatch them. When they do, the animals are overjoyed (\\"Finale\\").

Certain amino acids in these proteins can be substituted by others without losing structural integrity, a process creating regions capable of binding different antigens, depending on which amino acids are exchanged. In both types, the binding region is typically located in a beta sheet structure, whereas the binding regions of antibodies, called complementarity-determining regions, are flexible loops. = Based on gamma crystallin = Historically, Affilin molecules were based on gamma crystallin, a family of proteins found in the eye lens of vertebrates, including humans. It consists of two identical domains with mainly beta sheet structure and a total molecular mass of about 20 kDa. The eight surface-exposed amino acids 2, 4, 6, 15, 17, 19, 36, and 38 are suitable for modification. = Based on ubiquitin = Human ubiquitin, wild-type (). The N-terminal beta strand is the second from top, pointing right; the C-terminal strand is the one in front, pointing right and downwards. The exchangeable amino acids are located at the top left. Ubiquitin, as the name suggests, is a highly conserved protein occurring ubiquitously in eucaryotes. It consists of 76 amino acids in three and a half alpha helix windings and five strands constituting a beta sheet. For example, the eight surface-exposed exchangeable amino acids 2, 4, 6, 62, 63, 64, 65, and 66 are located at the beginning of the first N-terminal beta strand (2, 4, 6), at the nearby beginning of the C-terminal strand and the loop leading up to it (63–66). The resulting Affilin proteins are about 10 kDa in mass.  Properties  The molecular mass of crystallin and ubiquitin based Affilin proteins is only one eighth or one sixteenth of an IgG antibody, respectively. This leads to an improved tissue permeability, heat stability up to 90 °C (195 °F), and stability towards proteases as well as acids and bases. The latter enables Affilin proteins to pass through the intestine, but like most proteins they are not absorbed into the bloodstream. Renal clearance, another consequence of their small size, is the reason for their short plasma half-life, generally a disadvantage for potential drugs.  Production  Molecular libraries of Affilin proteins are generated by randomizing sets of amino acids by mutagenesis methods. Substituting selected amino acids at the potential binding site gives 198 ≈ 17,000,000,000 possible combinations (e.g.: eight amino acids substituted by 19 amino acids). Cysteine is excluded because of its liability to form disulfide bonds. In an Affilin protein comprising two modified ubiquitin molecules, for example, up to 14 amino acids are exchanged, resulting in 8 × 1017 combinations, but not all of these are realized in a given library. The next step is the selection of Affilin proteins that bind the desired target protein. To this end display techniques such as phage display or ribosome display are used. The fitting species are isolated and characterized physically, chemically and pharmacologically. Subsequent dimerisation or multimerisation can increase plasma half-life and, due to avidity, affinity to the target protein. Alternatively, multispecific Affilin molecules can be generated, binding different targets simultaneously. Radionuclides or cytotoxins can be conjugated to Affilin proteins, making them potential tumour therapeutics and diagnostics. Conjugation of cytokines has also been tested in vitro. Large-scale production of Affilin proteins is facilitated by E. coli and other organisms commonly used in biotechnology.

T. Blankenship (born March 11, 1928) is an American lawyer and Republican politician from Oklahoma. A former member and minority leader of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, he initiated the investigation of corruption on the Oklahoma Supreme Court that resulted in the removal of three justices during the mid 1960s and changing the process by which future justices would be selected. Leaving the House to run for higher office, Blankenship served as the 10th Attorney General of Oklahoma (the first Republican to hold that position). After serving as Attorney General, he entered private law practice in Oklahoma City and served two terms on the University of Oklahoma's Board of Regents. Early life Blankenship attended the University of Oklahoma and received a Bachelor of Arts. He was then admitted to the OU College of Law where he earned a Bachelor of Laws and became an attorney. Political career In 1960, Blankenship was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. He served in the State House until 1967. He was elected by his fellow Republicans to serve as the House Minority Leader from 1965 to 1967, making him the highest-ranking Republican in the House at that time. One of the most significant events during his career in the House, was a speech he delivered in January 1965 that revealed what would be called the Oklahoma Supreme Court Corruption Scandal. The speech resulted in a formal investigation and led to the impeachment and/or removal of three justices, as well as changing the process by which future justices would be selected for the court.Howard, Gene. \\"Gavel to Gavel: 'Supreme' history.\\" Journal Record, The (Oklahoma City). May 17, 2007. Accessed April 30, 2018. In the 1966 general election, Blankenship became the first Republican in state history to be elected Attorney General of Oklahoma. He succeeded Charles R. Nesbitt. Blankenship served one term as Attorney General from 1967 to 1971. After leaving office, Blankenship opened his private practice of law in Oklahoma City. He would later become Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Bank of Nichols Hills in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma. While engaged in private practice, Blankenship would become actively involved with the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. University of Oklahoma Blankenship was appointed to the board of regents of the University of Oklahoma in 1990 by Republican Governor of Oklahoma Henry Bellmon. He served two terms as chairman of the board of regents in 1995 and 1996. Governor Frank Keating reappointed him to the board in 1997. He was elected chairman again in 2003. His second term ended in 2004, after which he retired. The Sarkeys Foundation has established the G.T.

It also enables different representatives of the UK industry to discuss strategic issues facing construction and to develop joint strategies for industry improvement. History The Strategic Forum was established by ministers in 2001 as a successor to the Construction Industry Board (established following a recommendation in the 1994 Latham Report) and the Construction Task Force, established by the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in 1997.Ward, Don and Crane, Alan (2003) \\"The story so far\\" in Jones, David, Savage, David and Westgate, Rona, Partnering and Collaborative Working (Informa Professional, London), pp 1-26. Parts of the construction industry had withdrawn support for the Construction Industry Board, so construction minister Nick Raynsford MP established it initially as a Government-funded body. The Task Force had produced the 1998 Egan Report, and Sir John Egan was appointed the Forum's first chairman. In 2002, the Construction Industry Council, with backing from other umbrella bodies and Raynsford's successor as construction minister, Brian Wilson MP, changed the Forum to an independent industry group; Peter Rogers of property developer Stanhope plc succeeded Egan as chairman, serving until 2006.Construction Industry Council (2008), Reflections on 20 years of CIC (CIC, London), p.14) Prior to its 2016 reformation, the Forum was chaired by Lord O'Neill; the Forum is now chaired on a rotating basis by representatives from each of its six members. The Forum has been repeatedly criticised for not speaking on behalf of the entire industry (a role also claimed by the CBI's construction council). In August 2012, the then chief construction adviser Paul Morrell, speaking in a personal capacity, proposed to radically shake up the Forum's governance structure to present a unified industry voice to lobby the government, with Balfour Beatty chief executive Ian Tyler to chair a new advisory council to the Government Construction Board. The forum's role also came under scrutiny following the government's 2013 formation of a Construction Leadership Council. Structure The Strategic Forum initially had six key sector representatives, each looking after the interests of a particular sector: *industry clients (represented by the Construction Clients' Group, which includes public and private sector organisations, including Defence Estates, the BBC, BAA and Royal Mail, responsible for significant annual investment in construction projects) *professionals (Construction Industry Council - this presents the views of professional membership organisations, research institutions and specialist construction business associations, collectively comprising over 350,000 professionals and around 25,000 construction consultancy firms) *contractors (the UK Contractors Group and the Construction Alliance - UKCG accounted for about 30% of total industry output, while the Alliance represents over 13,500 firms,http://www.theconstructionalliance.org/ mainly SME contractors) *specialist contractors (National Specialist Contractors Council and Specialist Engineering Contractors Group - the NSCC presents the views of 32 specialist trade organisations, while the six main umbrella organisations in the SECG represent 60,000 companies, mostly SMEs) *product suppliers and manufacturers (Construction Products Association - the CPA represents 85% by value, of all UK manufacturers and suppliers of construction products, and covers 43 sector trade associations)http://www.constructionproducts.org.uk/aboutus/ *site workers (trade unions, represented by UCATT) In February 2016, the Forum was relaunched. Changes reflected a 2015 reformation of the Construction Leadership Council, and merger of the National Specialist Contractors Council with the UK Contractors Group to form Build UK. Now excluding site worker representation, the reconstituted Forum's membership comprised: *Construction Clients' Group *Construction Industry Council *Build UK *Construction Alliance *Specialist Engineering Contractors Group *Construction Products Association The Home Builders Federation and CBI also attend meetings. Activities In September 2002, the Strategic Forum published Accelerating Change. This set a headline target that 50% of projects should be undertaken by integrated teams and supply chains by 2007 (progress was made, but the target was not achieved). To help achieve the target, in 2003 it published an online Integration toolkit. The Strategic Forum seeks to promote and to monitor industry progress on six key areas (described in its Construction Commitments):Originally the 2012 Construction Commitments, aimed at promoting good practice on projects associated with the 2012 Olympic Games, the commitments were later extended to cover key principles that the Forum believed should be applied on all construction projects. See http://www.strategicforum.org.uk/cc.shtml *Procurement and integration *Commitment to people *Client leadership *Sustainability *Design quality *Health and safety As appropriate the Forum works with other bodies including Constructing Excellence (which also provides administrative support to the Construction Clients' Group) and CITB.

Its foundation document still exists, held in the archives of the Borthwick Institute for Archives in York. Malton Grammar School was one of three grammar schools founded in 1547 by the Archbishop of York, Robert Holgate - the other two were Archbishop Holgate's School in York, and Hemsworth Grammar School, near Wakefield. It existed in Old Malton until 1904, when it closed temporarily, reopening in new buildings on Middlecave Road in 1911 as a mixed Grammar School. These 1911 buildings were designed by architect Walter Brierley, and are still in use, now referred to as the East Wing of the current school. The first headteacher was Ernest Loraine Watt, who was head until 1938, when Thomas Arthur Williams took over following the death of Watt. The third head was Philip Taylor, from 1951 to 1971. Malton County Modern School was built on land adjacent to the grammar school in 1959. George Hanson was its only Headteacher during its 12-year existence. The County Modern and Grammar School merged in 1971 to become Malton School, a comprehensive school. Philip Taylor was nominated as Head, but died within a few weeks of the school opening. John Gresswell, who had been appointed as deputy for the school's opening, became head, from 1971-1989. The fifth headteacher was David Roberts, whose time in office ran from 1989 to 2006. He was succeeded by the current head, Robert Williams. The school was awarded specialist science status in 2004, with four new science laboratories built as part of the status. A £2.4 million community sports hall was opened on the school site by the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, in February 2011. Usage is shared between the school during the day and the community in the evening. In May 2011 the school's governing body proposed to convert to an academy – and subsequently to pursue conversion to a faith based school, re-establishing a link with the Church of England broken in 1911.

History In early 2008, although still a member of the band Georgie James, Davis began writing the songs that would form the basis for his first solo record. By the time Georgie James announced its dissolution in the summer of 2008, Davis had already written an album's worth of songs and called his new solo project Title Tracks. He put together a live version of the band that included Michael Cotterman on bass, Andrew Black on drums (both of whom had played in the primary live version of Georgie James) and Merideth Munoz on guitar, keyboards and vocals. In the fall of 2008, that version of the band recorded two songs, \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" and \\"Found Out,\\" with producer Chad Clark at Silver Sonya Studios in Washington, D.C. The single was released in April 2009 by Dischord Records. In January 2009, Davis commenced recording the debut Title Tracks full-length. The basic tracks were recorded at his practice space in NE Washington, D.C. Nick Anderson engineered and co- produced, along with Davis and Chad Clark. Additional tracking was done at Silver Sonya Studio and The National Crayon Museum. Davis played all of the instruments on the record, with the exception of Kriston Capps, who contributed saxophone to the song \\"No, Girl.\\" Tracyanne Campbell, of the band Camera Obscura, sang on the tracks \\"No, Girl\\" and \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" (a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song).

From author to audience: John Capgrave and medieval publication, University College Dublin Press, 1997, p.277 Fox seems to have been an avid collector of books, though in this period it was still relatively rare to find a high degree of literacy outside the clergy. He also appears to have had a strong interest in the cult of Saint Alban. Sections of the chronicle compiled by Fox, which is found in Woburn Abbey Ms. 181, were published in An English Chronicle of the Reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI, edited by J. S.

It had a capacity of 19,582 within 26 rows of lines, boxes, and bleachers on the first floor inside and a superior barrage surrounding the building. It was the last place in Catalonia where bullfights were held, since the Parliament of Catalonia passed a law banning bullfighting events on 28 July 2010 that came into force in 2012.

The plaza is currently used for sporting, musical and circus events. The building was originally built in the noucentista architectural style, the work of Manuel Joaquim Raspall i Mayol. The expansion work was done by Ignasi Mas i Morell and Domènec Sugrañes i Gras to give it its current facade, strongly influenced by Mudéjar and Byzantine architecture..

The soundtrack of the film has been composed by Pritam and the lyricist is Irshad Kamil. The film features cinematography by Thiru, the production design by Sabu Cyril and the editing by Arun Kumar. Tyag Rajan and R.P Yadav arranged and choreographed the action sequences of the film. The screenplay of the film is plagiarised from the American film Mississippi Burning. The film was a commercial failure. Plot Three medical friends from Delhi go missing in a small village – Jhanjhar. It's two months and there is no clue about their disappearance. The media and students movement demand action from the authorities. It's then that the government orders a Central Bureau of Investigation enquiry with officers Siddhant Chaturvedi (Akshaye Khanna) and Pratap Kumar (Ajay Devgan) to solve the case. They find it difficult to solve the case as the local police and other authorities are a part of Shool Sena, which is supported by the Home Minister and is responsible for illicit activities. Siddhant and Pratap also face Superintendent of police Ajatshatru Singh IPS (Paresh Rawal), a ruthless police officer who misuses his power. Not only that even the locals don't support the investigation. It's with the help of Roshni (Amita Pathak) who is the daughter of the village head and also very wealthy, and Geeta (Bipasha Basu), who is Ajatshatru's wife and Pratap's former love, that the investigation moves ahead. The truth behind the missing three friends is revealed by Geeta who witnessed the killing of these boys by a local politician helped by her husband. This investigation is filled with many traps and thrills created by Ajatshatru and his colleagues. They try to destroy the name of CBI in number of ways. The duo also manage to get one of the criminals to believe that the shool sena is trying to kill him assuming him to be a mole, and that he had better become a government witness for their case. The criminal who intimidated was only guilty of burying the bodies. Things get worse when Ajatshatru comes to know about his wife Geeta helping CBI. He then beats Geeta brutally with his belt behind closed doors and leaves her hospitalized. Pratap, filled with anger, traps each of the criminals by hacking their respective phone's databases and capturing their illicit activities on CCTV cameras. When it is Ajatshatru's turn, Pratap cuts him with a sharp razor and beats him brutally and mercilessly in a salon behind closed doors. In the end all the criminals are sentenced to imprisonment. However the longest sentence doled out was only for 10 years and the lightest was for 3. Obviously justice is still blind because there was no sentence passed for the 300 villagers burned alive, the cruel beating of the wife, or the kidnap, abuse, and cutting of the tongue of Jhamunia. But the story does not end there. As everyone is leaving the court, Siddhant slips a revolver into village woman Jhamunia's (Reema Sen) hands, with which she manages to kill all the culprits. The film ends with Siddhant and Pratap bidding goodbye at the railway station, and Geeta running behind Pratap as he boards the train to leave, with Siddhant watching on.

Formation After the formation of the Supreme Central Council of Aranjuez in September that started the war of independence, the University of Toledo approached the Provincial Council offering its services to create a battalion, without receiving a reply. On 14 August, the proposal was studied by various professors, and on the 17th the Corps of Honor Volunteers of the Royal University of Toledo Plan was approved. The proposal was submitted directly to the Supreme Central Council which approved it immediately, with the instruction that the University would be prepared to contribute its funds, together with the Town Council, for the support of the unit. The number of men was fixed at six hundred distributed in four companies for which the military command would choose the officers and non-commissioned officers. Any number of students and professors who wanted voluntarily could join the battalion. The students could enjoy academic advantages which included passing the time that would have been spent in the National Militia, in the Battalion. Also, the vestuary, uniformity and training hours were instituted. The unit remained entrusted to Lieutenant Colonel Bartolomé Obeso, who represented the Central Council. Activities The events of the war forced the Central Council to move to the south, on the road to Seville. After spending the night in Toledo on 1 December, the battalion of volunteers was designated as an escort until it reached the destination, which happened on 17 December. The unit remained in the area, fighting at the outskirts throughout 1809. In addition to supplying officers to diverse combat units, it was the embryo of the Seville Military Academy. Among its most prominent members was Baldomero Espartero, who would much later become Regent of Spain during the minority of Isabel II and the leader of the Progressive Party.

Participation in the Great Council was established on hereditary right, exclusive to the patrician families enrolled in the Golden Book of the Venetian nobility. The Great Council was unique at the time in its usage of lottery to select nominators for proposal of candidates, who were thereafter voted upon. The Great Council had the power to create laws and elected the Council of Ten. History In 1143 the Consilium Sapientium was formally established as a permanent representation of the sovereign Concio (or assembly) of freemen (citizens and patricians). The Act formalized the set-up in communal form of the State, with the birth of the Commune Veneciarum (\\"City of Venice\\"). Thirty years later (1172) the Consilium was transformed into sovereign assembly known as the Great Council. The council initially consisted of 35 councilors, but gradually expanded to over 100. Part of it was the Council of the Forty - whose members belonged to it by law - which served effectively as a Supreme Court or highest of constitutional bodies. The Council of Forty was established around the year 1179. =The Serrata of the Great Council= Chamber of the Great Council Proposals for participation in the transformation of the hereditary right to counsel or co-opted by the board itself had already been presented and rejected several times under dogado of Giovanni Dandolo, in 1286. However, under Doge Pietro Gradenigo the nobility insisted that to ensure more stability and continuity of participation in the Government of the Republic, new laws needed to be enacted. This was brought together on 28 February 1297, an event known as the Serrata (Lock-out). This provision of law opened the Great Council only to those who already had been part of the preceding four years,Frederic C. Lane Venice.

The reform also removed time limits on how long a person could be a member of the Council and the number of members increased to more than one 1,100.Frederic C. Lane Venice. A Maritime Republic, The Johns Hopkins University Press 1973, (Italian translation: \\"Storia di Venezia\\", Edizioni Einaudi, 1978, Torino, pag.133: \\"La riforma...provvide eliminando ogni limite alle dimensioni del consiglio stesso\\". (...) \\"I membri del Consiglio furono più che raddoppiati, salendo a oltre 1.100\\". The entry of new members was further limited by additional laws in 1307 and 1316. On 19 July 1315, a book of Italian nobilities was established. Only those listed in the book and above 18 years of age were eligible for the position in the Major Council. In 1423 the Great Council formally abolished the concio. =From the sixteenth century to the fall of the Republic= In 1506 and 1526, records were established in order to determine births and marriages to facilitate the detection of the right of access to the body of nobility. In 1527 the members of the Greater Council chose to grant equal rights to members of the council for all men over twenty years of the most illustrious families of the city. At this point, the council reached its maximum size of 2746 members.Alessandra Fregolent, Giorgione, Electa, Milano 2001, pag. 11. The effect of the provisions of the Serrata had increased dramatically the number of members. In the sixteenth century, it was common for up to 2095 patricians to have the right to sit in the Ducal Palace. There was an obvious difficulty in managing such a body. This led to a delegation of more immediate functions of government bodies to smaller, leaner and selected bodies, in particular the Senate. In some rare cases, facing severe economic difficulties and dangers, access to the Great Council was open to new families. By means of lavish gifts to the state, this was the case at the time of the War of Chioggia and the War of Candia, when, to support the enormous cost of the wars, new wealthy families were admitted. Another peculiarity was the creation over time of a division within the nobility itself, that is, families who were able in time to keep intact or to increase their economic capacity, and the poor ones (the so-called Barnabites). The latter may have gradually or suddenly lost their wealth, but continued to maintain the hereditary right to sit in the Great Council. This often took the two sides of the nobility to clash in council and opened the possibility to cases of vote buying. It was the Great Council, on 12 May 1797, that declared the end of the Republic of Venice, by deciding - upon the Napoleonic invasion - to accept the abdication of the last Doge Ludovico Manin and dissolve the aristocratic assembly: despite lacking the required quorum of 600 members, the board voted overwhelmingly (512 votes in favor, 30 against, 5 abstentions) the end of the Venetian Republic and the transfer of powers to an indefinite provisional government.

The barracks were constructed between 1724 and 1755 by friars of the Order of St. Francis, to replace a series of wooden buildings which had been destroyed by the ravages of the tropical climate in La Florida and by fire, both accidental fires and occasional intentional ones, such as when the city was razed by the English in 1702.St. Augustine and St. Johns County: A Historical Guide by William R. Adams, p. 40 The barracks were turned into a military structure by the British in 1763, after Florida became a British possession at the conclusion of the French and Indian War. At that time, the Franciscan friars vacated St. Augustine, along with a majority of the other Spanish residents. The name St. Francis Barracks also came to be applied to the military reservation which developed around the barracks, on the shore of the Matanzas River. There are several historic structures, including the King's Bakery, the only extant structure in St. Augustine constructed entirely within the twenty-year period of British occupation. Today the St. Francis Barracks serve as the Florida State Arsenal, headquarters for the Florida National Guard and its two subordinate organizations, the Florida Army National Guard and the Florida Air National Guard. A portion of the area is also the site of the St. Augustine National Cemetery. History =Spanish (1st and 2nd) and British Periods= Modern view of St. Francis Barracks When Pedro Menéndez de Avilés founded St. Augustine for the Spanish Crown, Jesuit priests were among the initial colonists to provide for the spiritual needs of the settlers and to help convert the native Timucua Indians to Christianity. In the 1570s the Jesuits were replaced by friars of the Order of St. Francis who were allocated land in 1588 at the southern end of the city for their monastery and church, Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion (Our Lady of the Conception). The original structures on the site were built of logs and palm thatch roofs. Throughout the years a succession of buildings were constructed as replacements. The structures were susceptible to rotting in the humid sub-tropical climate and were highly flammable. In 1702 all the structures in St. Augustine with the exception of the Castillo de San Marcos were burned to the ground in a raid led by English pirate Robert Searles. After this it was decided to rebuild the monastery with the same durable coquina used in the construction of the fort. Construction finally began in 1735 using coquina stone quarried at the King's Quarry located on Anastasia Island across Matanzas Bay from St. Augustine. The Franciscan friars lived at the monastery until the British took possession of Florida in exchange for occupied Havana which they seized from the Spanish in the French and Indian War, in which Spain was an ally of the French. Almost the entire population of Catholic St. Augustine left the city upon the British taking control in 1763 including the Franciscan friars and many of their Native American converts. The British, a large majority of whom were Protestant converted the friars former living quarters into military barracks for the troops stationed at the newly christened Fort St. Marks, the anglicized version of the Castillo de San Marco. During the British Period of occupation the military constructed an additional wooden barracks behind the coquina stone, St. Francis Barracks. They also constructed The King's Bakery, a coquina stone structure used for baking the bread for the city's garrison. This structure which has been used as a garage by the Florida National Guard since 1930 is located perpendicular to the barracks across Marine Street. It is believed to be the only structure surviving in St. Augustine built entirely during the British Period (1763–1784). After signing the Treaty of Paris, the British who conceded defeat in the American Revolution agreed to relinquish control of the Florida Territory, restoring Spain's possession of the land. Upon returning the Spanish military continued to use the St. Francis Barracks, as a military installation and troop barracks. During this period known as the Second Spanish Period (1763–1821) the wooden barracks built by the British were torn down. =U.S. Period / U.S. Military Installation= St. Francis Barracks came under control of the United States Army when the United States gained possession of Florida in 1821. The Barracks would remain an active U.S. Army installation until it was deactivated in 1900, with the exception of one year between 1861-1862 when it, like the rest of St. Augustine was under control of the Confederate States of America. In 1828, a portion of the southern end of the St. Francis Barracks military reservation was set aside as a post cemetery. In 1842, the U.S. soldiers who perished in the 1835 Dade Massacre were re-interred here under 3 coquina pyramid shaped monument, along with over 1,300 other U.S. casualties of the Second Seminole War. This cemetery would later be redesignated the St. Augustine National Cemetery. At the start of the American Civil War there was only one ordnance sergeant on duty, SGT Henry Douglas, who was responsible not only for the Barracks, but for Fort Marion as well (the American name for the nearby Castillo de San Marcos). On January 7, 1861, before Florida's formal secession from the Union, members of a newly formed local militia unit named the St. Augustine Blues, went to the St. Francis Barracks to demand the keys to the fort. The U.S. sergeant complied with the stipulation that he receive a receipt for the fort, which he was given. Douglas would later report that; “All military stores at this place were seized this morning by order of the Governor of the State of Florida. A company of volunteer soldiers marched to the barracks and took possession of me, and demanded peaceable possession of the keys of the fort and magazine.” The U.S. Army deactivated the fort in 1900 and leased it to the Florida State Troops, the forerunner of the present day Florida National Guard, in 1907. It was formally given to the State of Florida for use as the State Arsenal in 1921 by an act of Congress. After receiving use of the Barracks via lease in 1907, the buildings were not immediately occupied. In 1915, the St. Francis Barracks were gutted in a fire, however, the original coquina stone walls remained standing. The building was rebuilt in 1922 using the original walls.Florida National Guard - St. Francis Barracks Today, St. Francis Barracks, also known as the State Arsenal, is home to the Headquarters, Florida National Guard, headed by the Army or Air Force officer serving as The Adjutant General (TAG) of Florida, and the TAG's associated staff. It is also headquarters for the Florida Army National Guard and the Florida Air National Guard, headed by the Assistant Adjutant General - Army and the Assistant Adjutant General - Air Force, respectively, and their associated staffs. 35px References Category:Buildings and structures in St. Augustine, Florida Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1755 Category:Barracks in the United States Category:Military installations in Florida Category:St. Augustine, Florida ","title":"St. Francis Barracks"},{"id":"28190471","text":"Leptotes jeanneli, the Jeannel's blue, is a butterfly of the family Lycaenidae.

He gained his diploma in Art History and English language (University of Zagreb, 1969-1974), he then pursued the post-graduate study of Journalism (Faculty of Political sciences, Zagreb, 1975-76) and two-semester-course of contemporary Museology (Sorbonne, Paris, 1978-1979) and made his PhD in Museology (University of Ljubljana, 1985). Following a seven-year period of curatorships in Zagreb (1975-1981) and another seven years as Director of The Museum Documentation Centre (1981-1987), Šola joined the University of Zagreb and was appointed Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, having retired in full professor tenure (1987-2013). His academic research is closely linked to the profession and he draws on his practical experience as a curator, director, editor, lecturer and consultant. Professor Tomislav Šola’s main research interests are in the practice of heritage and especially in examining its theoretical underpinnings, for which he coined the terms “Heritology“ (1982) and “Mnemosophy” (1987). Both describe the convergence of museum and heritage related occupations into one mega- profession based upon common science. The latter term as certain „cybernetic philosophy of heritage, addresses public memory issues and institutions in a more accurate way. His broad lecturing and publishing activity covered many other themes. Most of his books and writings are freely accessible online. Professor Šola is the founder of The Best in Heritage, the world’s only annual survey of award-winning museum, heritage and conservation projects in Dubrovnik, (2002).

History indicates that the principles and practices of nursing in India are ancient. Prior to the 20th century, Indian nurses were usually young men, with women acting as midwives for assisting with childbirth. The acceptance of nursing as a profession in India is improved a lot with good quality of education and clinical exposure to students. Majority of Indian Nurses tend to move to abroad countries like Australia, Canada, USA, UK etc. as the better pay and working conditions. Military nursing Military nursing was the earliest type of modern nursing. In 1664 the East India Company started a hospital for soldiers in a house at Fort St. George, Madras. The first sisters were sent from St Thomas' Hospital, London to this military hospital. Maternity In 1797 a Lying-in-Hospital (maternity hospital) for the poor of Madras was built with the help of subscriptions by John Underwood. In 1854 the government sanctioned a training school for midwives in Madras. Florence Nightingale Florence Nightingale was the first woman to have great influence over nursing in India and had a close knowledge of Indian conditions, especially in the army. She was interested in the nursing service for the civilian population, though her first interest was the welfare of the army in India. In 1865, Nightingale drew up some detailed \\"Suggestions on a system of nursing for hospitals in India\\". Graduates were sent out from the Nightingale School of Nurses at St Thomas' Hospital, England to start similar schools in India. St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi was the first one to begin training the Indian women as nurses in 1867. Training schools In 1871, the first school of nursing was started in Government General Hospital, Madras with a six-month diploma midwives programme with four students. The first nursing school for women was started at Kanpur's Saint Catherine's Hospital by Dr Alice Marval. Four female superintendents and four trained nurses from England were posted to Madras. Between 1890 and 1900, many schools, under either missions or government, were started in various parts of India. In the 20th century, national nursing associations were started. In 1897, B. C. Roy worked to the standards of nursing and nurses of both sexes. 20th century In 1908, the Trained Nurses Association of India was formed to uphold the dignity and honour of the nursing profession. In 1918, training schools were started for health visitors and dais, at Delhi and Karachi. Two English nurses, Griffin and Graham, were appointed to give training and to supervise the nurses. In 1926, Madras State formed the first registration council to provide basic standards in education and training. The first four-year bachelor's degree programme was established in 1946 at the college of nursing in Delhi and the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) in Vellore. With the assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation, seven health centres were set up between 1931 - 1939 in the cities of Delhi, Madras, Bangalore, Lucknow, Trivandrum, Pune and Calcutta. In 1947, after Indian independence, the community development programme and the expansion of hospital service created a large demand for nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives, health visitors, midwives, nursing tutors and nursing administrators. The Indian Nursing Council was passed by ordinance on December 31, 1947. The council was constituted in 1949. In 1956, Adrenwala was appointed as the Nursing Advisor to Government of India. The development of Nursing in India was greatly influenced by the Christian missionaries, WorldWar, British rule and by the International agencies such as the World Health Organization UNICEF, the Red Cross, UNSAID etc. The first master’s degree course, a two-year postgraduate programme was begun in 1960 at the Rajkumari Amrit Kaur College of Nursing, Delhi. In 1963, the School of Nursing in Trivandrum, instituted the first two-year post certificate bachelor's degree programme. Associations such as the International Council of Nurses, the nurses auxiliary of the CMA of India, T.N.A.I. Indian Nursing Council and State level Registration Council promote and support the nursing profession. Nursing specialties and areas of practice in India There was a time when professional nurses had very little choice of service because nursing was centred in the hospital on bedside nursing. Career opportunities are more varied now for a number of reasons. Career options include: *A staff nurse provides direct patient care to one patient or a group of patients. Assists ward management and supervision. Directly responsible to the ward supervisor. *Ward sister or nursing supervisor, responsible to the nursing superintendent for the nursing care management of a ward or unit.

He is the president of political party called the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. He is a three-time Member of Parliament (MP). He is the grandson of B. R. Ambedkar. He was a member of the 12th and 13th Lok Sabha Akola constituency of India. He has served in both houses of the Indian Parliament. Personal life Prakash Ambedkar is the eldest grandson of B. R. Ambedkar and Ramabai Ambedkar. His father's name is Yashwant Ambedkar (Bhaiyasaheb) and mother's name is Meera. The Ambedkar family are followers of Navayana Buddhism. He has two younger brothers Bhimrao and Anandraj, and a sister Ramabai who is married to Anand Teltumbde. Prakash Ambedkar is married to Anjali Maydeo, with whom he has a son.  Early life and education  Prakash Ambedkar was born on 10 May 1954 in Bombay (now Mumbai). In 1972 he completed his higher secondary education from St. Stanislaus High School, Mumbai. In 1978, he received Bachelor of Arts (BA) from Siddhartha College of Arts, and in 1981 he got Bachelor of Laws (LLB) in Siddharth College of Law, Mumbai. Political career On 4 July 1994, Prakash Ambedkar established the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh. This party was a splintered group amongst other factions of the Republican Party of India which was constituted on directions of his grandfather after his death. The Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangha contested established political parties like Indian National Congress, Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party in the Akola municipal elections, emerging victorious. The success was gained through the new social engineering brought by Prakash Ambedkar which later known as \\"Akola Pattern\\". The expansion of the party continued after 1995, that some of the non-Dalit parties and organisations have joined the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh. Ambedkar was a member of the Rajya Sabha during 1990 - 1996. He was elected in the 12th Lok Sabha elections from Akola Lok Sabha constituency in 1998 as a candidate of the Republican Party of India. Second time from the same constituency in 1999, he was elected as the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh's candidate for the 13th Lok Sabha elections and he was a member of the Lok Sabha till 2004.http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lok13/biodata/13MH19.htmhttps://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lok13/biodata/13MH19.htm Ambedkar followed a policy, on the one hand, of regrouping the Dalits, and on the other of following a moderate line seeking alliance with those opposition parties which sympathised with the Dalit cause. It was with their support that he twice contested elections to the parliament from non-reserved constituencies. Though not successful in getting elected, he polled a sizeable number of votes on both the occasions. The RPI organised a march from Nashik to Mumbai to press its demands, prominent among which was the transfer of vatan lands to their Dalit cultivators. (Both before and after the British Raj, certain lands were given to people for services rendered by them to the government or to the community or to both. These lands are also called \\"watan lands\\" in local legislation and in Maharashtra many of the watans were abolished between 1950 and 1960.) In response, the government appointed a committee with Prakash Ambedkar as a member. The RPI's greatest success was in 1988 when Ambedkar, in alliance with other Dalit organisations, took out a massive demonstration in Mumbai. The occasion was the controversy regarding a move to delete from the official publication of B. R. Ambedkar's writings a portion called Riddles of Hinduism. The deletion move was supported by Shiv Sena which by this time was emerging as a Hindu political organisation. To bring all Dalit organisations together for this purpose, Prakash Ambedkar formed Ambedkar Vichar Samvardhak Samiti (AVSS). Under the leadership of Prakash Ambedkar, R. S. Gavai and others on 5 February 1988, Dalits put on a massive show of strength which brought more than four to five lakh followers of B. R. Ambedkar into the heart of Mumbai city from different parts of Maharashtra and also from Gujarat and other states. Within days of the Dalit demonstration in Mumbai, the 'Riddles' issue was resolved at a meeting on February 10 of representatives of the Shiv Sena, the Maratha Mahasangh and the various groups of the Republican Party of India and the Dalit Panthers called by the state chief minister. It was agreed at the meeting that the relevant appendix would be retained intact in the fourth volume of Ambedkar's works; only a line would be added to clarify that the Maharashtra government did not agree or disagree with B. R. Ambedkar's comments on the Hindu gods. Bahujan Mahasangh, a political formation working in close association with the Bharatiya Republican Party led by Prakash Ambedkar, was formed in February 1993. In the summer of that year, its candidate won Kinwat legislative assembly seat in Nanded district, defeating Congress and BJP contestants. The alliance between Bharatiya Republican Party and Bahujan Mahasangh visualised a joint front of Dalits and OBCs whose cultural identity was essentially non- Brahmin. Bahujan Mahasangh argued that in the Brahminical social order, both Dalits and OBCs find themselves equally oppressed culturally. Bahujan Mahasangh had defined the Bahujan category to include Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains and Muslims, as well as caste groups such as Shudra (OBCs) and ati-Shudra (Dalits), tribes, women, poor Marathas, and poor Brahmins, thus including all those who are subjugated through caste, class and gender exploitation. In memory of Mahar soldiers who fought in the Battle of Koregaon, their descendants (Buddhists) visit Koregaon Bhima on 1 January every year to honor them. On 1 January 2018, Buddhists, as well as some Hindu dalit, OBC and Sikh people visited the 'Jay sthambh' (victory pillar) at Koregaon Bhima in Pune district, Maharashtra.Prakash Ambedkar accused Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote of seducing the invading Hindutva people and demanded the police investigation and strict action against the two. But the Maharashtra government and the state police did not take any action against the culprits. So on 3 January 2018, he called on the people of Maharashtra to call \\"Maharashtra Bandh\\". This call to shut down Maharashtra received a huge response from the people and the bandh was a success. The bandh was seen across Maharashtra including Mumbai. According to Ambedkar, more than 50% Maharashtrian people participated in the bandh. Earlier only Bal Thackeray of Shiv Sena had the power to shut down Mumbai. Subsequently, Prakash Ambedkar's political power increased. He came to the center of Ambedkarite and Bahujan community. The youth group in particular became his supporters. Prakash Ambedkar founded new political party the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi on 20 March 2018 with its ideology primarily emphasizing Constitutionalism, Ambedkarism, Secularism, Socialism and Progressivism. The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi registered as a political party a year later on 15 March 2019, prior to the 2019 elections for Lok Sabha. It is supported by nearly 100 small political parties and social organizations. Prakash Ambedkar is the supremo of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. On 14 March 2019, Ambedkar has announced the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh will merge with the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. He said that, despite the 'Akola pattern' of social engineering through the success of the Bharipa- Bahujan Mahasangh, the word 'Bharipa' (RPI) had limited the expansion of the party. He said that after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharip-Bahujan Mahasangh will merge with the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, because the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi is acceptable in a broad sense. Ambedkar contested and lost from both Akola and Solapur in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.  Controversy  Prakash Ambedkar courted controversy by asking his supporters to resort to troll against those who criticised his statement asking for proof on surgical strikes conducted by Indian Air Force. Many critics called it militant Dalit politics.https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/mumbai-prakash-ambedkar- appeals-to-party-workers-to-trash-out-trolls-against-him/1474790.

He was one of Denmark's most prominent painters in the 1890s. Early life and education As a boy, Johansen already had a talent for drawing which was recognized by Wilhelm Marstrand. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1868 to 1875, specializing in figure painting, but did not pass the graduation examination. Career His earliest works are from Hornbæk where he painted between 1872 and 1876 with works such as Et Maaltid and Nabokonens Besøg. A Christmas Story He first became associated with the Skagen Painters in 1875, encouraged by his fellow students Karl Madsen and Michael Ancher.Svanholm p.54 From 1885, he exhibited in Paris; there he was inspired by Claude Monet, particularly in his use of colour as can be seen in his painting Christian Bindslev er syg (Christian Bindslev is ill, 1890), which also shows the influence of Christian Krohg, one of the other Skagen painters. After his return from Paris, his paintings took on lighter tones; he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison.Svanholm p.99 Nevertheless, Johansen is remembered particularly for the subdued lighting effects of his interiors — many of which were painted after his visit to Paris — as in his Glade jul (Merry Christmas, 1891), Aftenpassiar (Evening Talk, 1886) and Aftenselskab i kunstnerens hjem (Evening Gathering at the Artist's Home, 1899) and his scenes of domestic family life, but he also painted landscapes (at Skagen, at Tisvilde, and at his childhood home, the fishing port of Dragør outside Copenhagen), still lifes and portraits. After a falling out with P.S. Krøyer in 1891, Johansen's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years.Svanholm pp. 122-130 From 1888 to 1906, he taught at the Artists Academy's School for Women. He then became a professor there until 1920 and, for a time, was one of its directors. Private life Martha, the artist's wife, painting by Viggo Johansen It is said that in Skagen, he showed just as much interest in playing Mozart on the hotel piano or Gluck on the church organ as in painting.\\"Johansen, Viggo\\", Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, 1932–44, Bind 8. Retrieved 29 July 2010. He married Anna Ancher's cousin Martha Møller in 1880. Martha often served as a model, for example in Køkkeninteriør (Kitchen interior, 1884) — which may have been inspired by Anna Ancher's similarly composed The Girl in the Kitchen — Sovekammerscene (Bedroom Scene, 1885) and Børnene vaskes (Washing the Children, 1888) which were painted partially on the basis of photographs.\\"Viggo Johansen\\", Den store Danske. Retrieved 29 July 2010. Viggo Johansen's daughter, Ellen, was also a painter. She married the painter Johannes Ottesen. Awards In 1886, Johansen was awarded the Exhibition Medal for the painting Evening Talk. In 1889, many of the Skagen artists received awards at Exposition Universelle in Paris; Johansen won a Gold Medal for Børnene vaskes.

After pleading guilty, Chesser was sentenced in federal court on February 24, 2011 to 25 years in prison. Early life and marriage Chesser was born in Charlottesville, Virginia to Barbara Katenbrink Chesser, a lawyer and prosecutor, and David Chesser. His parents divorced. Chesser moved to Fairfax County, Northern Virginia by the time he was in middle school. He was selected for the Gifted and Talented program at Kilmer Middle School. He graduated from Oakton High School in 2008. Chesser was known as an athlete, participating in the Oakton's football, basketball and crew teams. His yearbook profile said: \\"As the only Caucasian member of the break-dancing club, senior Chesser was not intimidated by being the only non-Asian.\\" After high school, in 2008, Chesser enrolled at George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia, dropping out after one semester. In 2009, he married Proscovia Nzabanita, a Ugandan Muslim woman, and they had a son, Talhah. (Nzabanita's mother Cecilia is Roman Catholic.) Since Chesser's incarceration, his mother Barbara and Barbara's life partner Stacy Anderson, also a lawyer, have had custody of his son against Chesser and Nzabanita's wishes. His wife Nzabanita was deported from the United States. He worked briefly as a caretaker at the Islamic Center of Northern Virginia in Fairfax. Pursuit of Islamic activism Chesser told FBI agents he became interested in Islam in July 2008. High school friends said his interest seemed to start when he began dating a Muslim girl. Sources disagree about whether he converted. Chesser used online media to disseminate his views, catching the attention of Jarret Brachman, a terrorism scholar, who engaged Chesser in email correspondence. In his 2008 book on terrorism, Brachman had coined the term \\"jihobbyist\\" for people such as Chesser, who are fascinated by Islam or jihad but were not members of recognized terrorist organizations.Jarret Brachman, Global Jihadism: Theory and Practice By 2010, Chesser had created a YouTube account called LearnTeachFightDie, and a website called the mujhidblog.com. He had e-mail correspondence with Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American Muslim cleric hiding in Yemen. United States officials have alleged that the latter has encouraged homegrown terrorism. Al-Awlaki was later targeted and killed in a drone strike because of his role in al-Qaeda attacks against the United States. In 2009, both friends and members of the Islamic Center of Northern Virginia noticed that Chesser's views were becoming more extreme; he had conservative ideas about dress customs. An older member at the Islamic Center said he tried to broaden Chesser's views of the Islamic scriptures, and that Chesser took too narrow a view. In April 2010, Chesser wrote an e-mail to FoxNews.com, saying that he sought to \\"raise awareness of the correct understanding of key Islamic beliefs\\". He said \\"If you kill us, then we kill you\\", and he quoted al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, saying that Muslims had the freedom to act against attacks on the Prophet. He further wrote in the e-mail: > I seek to help the world understand that neither the Muslims in general nor > the mujahideen including Al Qaeda are abject to peace, but that this peace > come with the following conditions: a complete withdrawal of non-Muslim > forces from Muslim lands, an ending of the propping up of the apartheid > regime of Israel, and a ceasing of the propping up of the brutal dictators > we currently have who refuse to rule by divine law. ...

As > Usama bin Laden said with regard to the cartoons of Denmark, if there is no > check in the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the > freedom of our actions. Chesser became one of the most visible members helping the American Jesse Curtis Morton, aka Younes Abdullah Mohammed, run the radical Revolution Muslim website. Morton has said he created the site to promote propaganda supporting al-Qaeda.US v. Chesser, Zachary, Investigative Project on Terrorism This was one of the few American websites to praise the 2009 Fort Hood Shooting, in which a US Army psychiatrist killed fellow soldiers. In April 2010, Revolution Muslim's website posted a statement jointly drafted by Chesser (under the online username Abu Talhah al-Amrikee) and Morton that warned South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone of violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. The post included the business addresses of likely targets of retribution, including Comedy Central and Parker and Stone's production company. Chesser threatened the South Park creators on a variety of other online platforms, including his blog and Twitter pages. Chesser wrote, \\"We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh if they do air this show.\\" He was referring to the 2004 murder of a Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh, by a Muslim extremist. Legal proceedings On July 10, 2010, Chesser was arrested with his infant son while boarding a flight to Somalia via Uganda. He told federal agents that he intended to go to Somalia, home of al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization. An affidavit filed in federal court alleges that he intended to join Al-Shabaab as a \\"foreign fighter.\\" He was charged with aiding al-Shabaab, which is aligned with al-Qaeda and has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. After pleading guilty, Chesser was sentenced in federal court on February 24, 2011 to 25 years in prison. On October 20, 2010, Chesser pleaded guilty to three felonies: communicating threats to Parker and Stone, soliciting violent jihadists to \\"desensitize\\" law enforcement, and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. \\"Desensitizing\\" law enforcement referred to plans to place suspicious-looking but inoffensive packages in public places, until police became lax about dealing with them, at which point a real explosive could be used. These three charges carried a maximum of 30 years in prison; Chesser's sentence was 25 years. Morton also pleaded guilty to terrorist-related charges.\\"New York man guilty of South Park murder threat\\". ABC News, 9 February 2012, accessed 10 January 2013 In February 2012, the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released a report entitled: Zachary Chesser: A Case Study in Online Islamist Radicalization and Its Meaning for the Threat of Homegrown Terrorism. The report traced Chesser's upbringing in Virginia, his lack of direction, his attraction to minority beliefs and attention-seeking, and his rapid transformation into a convicted terrorist. The report was based on Chesser's writings, including 37 pages of written correspondence between Chesser and Committee staff, from August to October 2011, after he had been imprisoned. In June, 2014 Chesser was transferred from the United States Penitentiary, Marion to the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado due to repeated rules infractions. He was then transferred out of ADX and into United States Penitentiary, Florence High for a short period of time until being moved once more to United States Penitentiary, Hazelton in 2019, where he is currently incarcerated.

Conceived by speculative developer Joshua Hanson as Brighton underwent its rapid transformation into a fashionable resort, the three-sided \\"set piece\\" of 69 houses and associated structures was built between 1818 and 1832. Most of the houses overlooking the central garden were complete by 1824. The site was previously known, briefly and unofficially, as Belle Vue Field. The square was a prestigious, high-class development, attracting the social elite. The central garden, originally private, has been council-owned since 1885 and publicly accessible since WW2. An underground car park was built beneath it in 1969. Most of the buildings in and around the square have been designated Listed buildings: 47 houses are each listed at Grade II*, the second-highest designation, while 18 other houses, a war memorial, a nearby inn and a set of bollards outside it have each been given the lower Grade II status. The house at the southwest corner is now numbered as part of King's Road but was built as part of Regency Square, and is also Grade II*-listed. History =Belle Vue Field= Regency Square was built on one of the fields to the west of the town but within the parish of Brighton. The field was briefly and unofficially known as Belle Vue Field after it was acquired by Francis Hanson, the owner of the nearby Belle Vue House, in the late 1790s. Belle Vue House was built near to a windmill known as West Mill. The windmill was owned by Matthew Bourne in 1744, but was not marked on Ogilby's 1762 map, although a windmill is shown on Lambert's View of Brighthelmstone which is dated 1765. In the 1790s, the windmill was owned by John Streeter. On 28 March 1797, when 86 oxen dragged it uphill on a sled to the nearby village of Preston. It was re-erected there and renamed Preston Mill. After several more renamings, it was demolished in 1881. Its machinery was cannibalised by the owners of nearby Waterhall Mill. A watercolour painting, now displayed at Preston Manor, shows crowds of people watching the mill's removal to Preston. By the late 18th century, Brighthelmstone (as it was originally known) had begun to develop into a fashionable coastal resort. When the annual town fair could no longer be accommodated on its traditional site in the Old Town, Belle Vue Field was used as one of several temporary locations. Belle Vue Field is sometimes said to have been the site, in 1793, of a 10,000-man military encampment. However, Belle Vue Field did not yet exist in 1793 and contemporaneous sources show that the encampment occupied a much wider area of land, extending as far as the boundary with the neighbouring parish of Hove. Jane Austen refers to the encampment in her novel Pride and Prejudice (written in 1796 and published in 1813). The heroine Elizabeth Bennet's sister is invited to Brighton and elopes with, and later marries, army officer George Wickham. The annual military encampments moved to other sites in and around Brighthelmstone in subsequent years. =Hanson builds the square= In 1818, the field was acquired by Francis Hanson's son, Joshua Flesher Hanson, a businessman. By this time, Brighton's profile was such that speculators were commissioning architects and builders to design and lay out sea-facing residential developments to attract wealthy long-term visitors or permanent residents. Royal Crescent, New Steine and Bedford Square were already in existence; Clarence Square, Russell Square and Marine Parade were being developed. Hanson's plan for Regency Square was on a much larger scale than these developments. He divided Belle Vue Field into 69 plots, leased them individually and put strict covenants in place, demanding that each house be built in a specific style in order to ensure architectural harmony. In return, the leaseholders (mostly private builders) would have the right to buy, and would end up with houses much larger than average for the town, with excellent sea views and exclusive access to the large central garden. Most leaseholders bought the houses as soon as they could, which was to Hanson's advantage as he made money and had no ongoing responsibility for the buildings. Restrictions in the covenants included the requirement to erect a façade with an iron balcony, to clad the area below the balcony in stucco, to paint the façade at least every three years, to repair any damage, and to pay towards maintenance of the central garden. No stucco was to be applied above the balcony line. The covenants included a requirement to form a residents' committee, whose job it was to ensure the covenants were obeyed and to impose a levy on the occupiers of the houses to pay for the upkeep of the garden. Regency Tavern stands at the northeastern corner of the square Although there is no documentary evidence confirming the architects, most sources attribute Regency Square's buildings to the father-and-son partnership of Amon and Amon Henry Wilds, who moved to Brighton from nearby Lewes in 1815 and became two of Brighton's most important architects; they were extremely prolific, and were responsible for defining and developing the town's distinctive Regency style. Although they worked extensively with fellow architect Charles Busby during the 1820s, historians agree that he was not involved in Regency Square, at least not in its early stages: the buildings \\"appear to lack his distinctive flair\\" and are not as impressive as those at the Kemp Town estate to the east of Brighton, which all three men were involved with. No. 1 Regency Square (now 131 Kings Road) is confirmed as the work of Amon Henry Wilds. Some evidence points to William Mackie being involved in the design of houses on the east side of the square. Building work started in 1818 and continued until 1832, with most of the houses complete by 1824. A passageway (Regency Colonnade) was built at the northeast corner to connect the square to the neighbouring development of Russell Square. The Regency Tavern has occupied most of the passageway since the 1870s, all of it since 1939. St Margaret's Church, an Anglican chapel of ease designed in the Greek Revival/Neoclassical style in 1824 by Busby, was the local place of worship. 131 King's Road was formerly known as 1 Regency Square and St Albans House In 1866 the West Pier, designed by Eugenius Birch, was built opposite the square's central garden. Unusually, Hanson had set a 71-year time limit on the covenants rather than granting them in perpetuity, and on 25 December 1889 they were due to expire. Among other things, residents would then lose their rights to use the gardens. The residents committee, led by solicitor Somers Clarke (unrelated to the Brighton-born architect of that name), attempted unsuccessfully to purchase the gardens and extend the covenants by an Act of Parliament; two years later, the passing of the Brighton Improvement Act 1884 achieved the same aims. Brighton Corporation took ownership of the gardens, and householders signed new deeds confirming they wished for the covenants relating to their houses to be extended indefinitely. =20th century= From the beginning, Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, and it is still considered to be \\"one of Brighton's best sea-facing squares\\". By the mid-20th century most of the houses had become hotels, but the majority have since been converted into flats and the square today is overwhelmingly residential. In early 1963 a surface-level car park was planned for the Brighton Corporation owned central garden; this was changed to a 520-space underground car park, created in 1967-9 using the cut and cover method in which the garden was dug up, the car park with roof constructed, and the lawns and flowerbeds restored. Richard Seifert's , Modernist 24-storey residential block, Sussex Heights, was built in 1968 on land immediately to the east of the square, and was criticised for affecting the character of the square because of its contrasting style and height. During the early 1970s the hotels sought permission from Brighton Corporation to erect neon signs advertising themselves; after negotiation with the Regency Society, a Brighton-wide conservation group formed in 1945, the Corporation made the square and the surrounding area into a conservation area in 1973. Conservation area status gives the council firmer control over planning permission and changes to buildings or street furniture, especially in respect of their effect on \\"the character and appearance of the area\\". The original conservation area has since been enlarged twice to its present size of . Architecture Almost all buildings in Regency Square have been designated a Listed building: 47 houses are each listed at Grade II*, while 18 other houses, a memorial, an inn and a set of bollards, have each been given the lower Grade II status. The house at the south west corner is now numbered as part of King's Road, but was built as part of Regency Square and is also Grade II*-listed. The five Grade II* parts of the square, including the house at the south west corner (formerly St Albans House), were listed on 13 October 1952. The entire west side was listed in 1952: St Albans House, the three houses at numbers 2–4 and the sixteen houses at number 5-20. The northern side's central section, numbers 26–37, forms another Grade II* listing. On the east side, all of the surviving original houses, at numbers 51–56, 57–59 and 60–66, are listed at Grade II*. Apart from St Albans House, all of these listings include iron railings attached to the exterior. Numbers 22–25 and 38–46, on the north side, were listed at Grade II on 20 August 1971, while most of the rest of the square's original houses were listed at the same grade on 26 August 1999: numbers 46a, 46b and 47–49. All listings except numbers 46a and 46b include attached railings. The listing for numbers 38–46 includes a carriage arch, which has nonetheless been lost. A small block of flats, Abbotts, stands at the southeast corner of the square. Built by architecture firm Fitzroy Robinson & Partners in 1961–62, it replaced three of the original Regency Square houses (nos. 67–69) which, along with the neighbouring property at 129 Kings Road, had been converted into a hotel of the same name in the early part of the 20th century. The original four houses were considered \\"quite good\\" by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner. =Grade II* listings= ;2–4 Regency Square 2–4 Regency Square These three four-storey houses (now the Beach Hotel) have double bow fronts, and were considered by Nikolaus Pevsner to be more austere in their detailing than most Brighton houses of their era. Number 2, a former home of social reformer William King (whose two-year stay is commemorated by a blue plaque), is built of brick which has been painted over; the others are stuccoed. Each house also has a basement and a dormer window. The ground floors are rusticated and have arched doorways set into Classical-style porches with both Ionic and Doric columns—the latter in the form of antae. The tripartite bay windows are neither full-height nor continuous: only the first three storeys have them, and they are offset to the right on the first and second floors. The first-floor windows sit between a curved cast-iron balcony and a verandah-style canopy supported on decorative brackets. On each house, the third floor has three small flat-arched sash windows; the centre window sits below a small cornice supported on corbels. ;5–20 Regency Square 5–20 Regency Square These sixteen houses form the greater part of the square's west side. Although there are differences in height and detail between individual houses, they were designed at the same time and maintain \\"the longstanding tradition of the terraced townhouse\\" which had been developed \\"by Henry Holland [...] in his own speculative enterprises at Hans Town and Sloane Street, London\\". Numbers 7, 8, 11 and 15 are entirely stuccoed; number 18 retains its original unpainted yellow-brick upper façade; and all other houses have painted brick to their upper storeys and stuccoed ground floors with rustication. The roofs are mansard-style and laid with slate. Each house has dormer windows; numbers 5–13 inclusive rise to four storeys, while the other seven houses are one storey shorter. All houses except number 12 have a single bay window, mostly in tripartite form. Number 12 has three windows to each floor. The entrance porches, reached via staircases, are either Doric or Ionic in form, with columns and entablatures. They have arch-headed doorways set into them. Small cast-iron balconies run across the terrace at first-floor level (although number 5's has been lost), and some houses have canopy-style verandahs as well. A nearly continuous cornice (absent on numbers 13 and 19) spans the terrace; some houses also have a second cornice above this. Several houses have fanlights with coloured glass, and other non-standard details include decorative stucco panelling at number 5; paterae (circular motifs), triglyph-decorated friezes and other Classical-style ornamentation in some of the porch entablatures; original window-guards of iron; a blocked doorway flanked by pilasters at number 20; and many original sash windows. ;26–37 Regency Square 26–37 Regency Square These 12 houses, arranged along the sea-facing north side in the form of two wings flanking a four-house centrepiece, are the focal point of the square, forming \\"a kind of palace front\\" topped with a pediment displaying in prominent black lettering. Pevsner described this feature as \\"not [being] enough of an accent to pull the square together\\". The terrace is a five-part composition: the end \\"wings\\" (formed by numbers 26–27 and 36–37) are of four storeys, stuccoed and with tall parapets pinched upwards to form small pediments; the central section (numbers 30–33), also of four storeys and built in yellow brick, and topped with the inscribed pediment; and numbers 28–29 and 34–35, rising to three storeys and forming a link between the central and outer sections. Numbers 30–33 have a two-window range, rather than the single window on each of the other houses, and have four pilasters running the full height of the façade and terminating at the parapet in circular antefixae. The entrance porches are of the Ionic order. Each house has a canopied cast-iron balcony at first-floor level. There is rusticated decoration at ground-floor level. ;51–56 Regency Square 51–56 Regency Square with Sussex Heights behind The east side of Regency Square is architecturally less consistent than either the north or west sides. Numbers 51–56 were designed as a symmetrical composition: the two houses at the centre stand forward slightly and have a more prominent pediment. Each house has four storeys and a single bay window on the ground and first floors; other common features include rustication on the ground floor and Ionic-style porches with recessed flat-arched doorways and arched fanlights. There are cast-iron balconies at first-floor level; number 52's has a canopy above it. Some windows are sashes, and numbers 52, 53, 54 and 56 have dormer windows in their slate roofs. ;57–59 Regency Square 57–59 Regency Square These three houses may also have been designed as a single composition, but this effect has been lost. Numbers 58 and 59 are of five storeys; number 57 has four storeys and dormer windows. The parapet rises into an intricately decorated pediment above number 58, with palmette scrollwork and semicircular antefixae. Each house has an Ionic-columned porch with a straight-headed door and semicircular fanlight. Numbers 57 and 59 have canopies and first-floor balconies; number 58 has only a balcony. The three houses are the only ones on the east side to have full-height bows, and number 57 is unique on that side in retaining its original unpainted yellow-brick façade. ;60–66 Regency Square 60–66 Regency Square These seven houses are also a symmetrical composition: the three in the middle are set forward and have a tall parapet topped by a very shallow pediment. Like the rest of the east side, the houses have Ionic porches with flat-arched doors and round-headed fanlights. The ground and first floors have three-part bay windows topped with cornices. Except on number 63, a narrow canopy sits between the first-floor window and the cornice. Another cornice spans the full width of the terrace above third-floor level. The slightly recessed houses on each end (numbers 60–61 and 65–66) have pairs of dormer windows. ;131 King's Road The former St Albans House was designed in 1828 by Amon Henry Wilds alone and was fitted out by William Izard. A shopfront was fitted in the early 20th century, and the ground floor has housed a restaurant since 1930. Contemporary with the shopfront was the round-headed entrance on the King's Road elevation, with an archway supported on fluted columns, a dentil-patterned cornice and ornamentation including scrollwork and a panel inscribed . The building has five storeys, three windows facing King's Road and the sea, and a five-window range to Regency Square. It is stuccoed and slate-roofed. The shopfront is topped by a thin cast-iron balcony. The right-hand (east) side of the King's Road façade has a full-height tripartite segmental bay window with architraves to each window. The Regency Square elevation also has a three-light full- height bay window; all other windows are blocked. =Grade II listings= ;22–25 Regency Square Numbers 22–25 Regency Square—at the northwest corner of the square on a short road leading to Preston Street—include the building (number 67) on the corner of that street, which absorbed the house built as number 21 Regency Square. These bow-fronted terraced houses were built in the early 1820s. Number 67 Preston Street is of three storeys and has a shopfront facing west into that street; alongside that is a porch with rusticated decoration and an arched doorway. The Regency Square (south) façade has blocked windows at first- and second-floor level. The four houses facing Regency Square are of three storeys, except number 25 which also has an attic storey. They are of brick faced with painted stucco. Each house has a chimney on its slate roof. Each has an entrance staircase with iron railings, a rusticated ground floor, a single bay window to each storey, an iron balcony at first-floor level, a cornice and a parapet in front of the roof. At numbers 22 to 24, dormer windows cut through the parapet. ;38–46 Regency Square Numbers 38–46 Regency Square run alongside the northeast side, and are contemporary with the houses at the northwest corner. A carriage arch ran between numbers 42 and 43. Together with numbers 22–25 and the Grade II*-listed centrepiece of numbers 26–37, the houses form an approximately symmetrical three-part arrangement when viewed from the south. Each house is of stucco-clad brick, and all but number 40 have slate-covered roofs. All houses rise to three storeys and have dormer windows; number 43 has two bay windows on each floor (except the ground floor, where the space is taken up by the carriage arch), but the other houses have only one. Each house also has a balcony, a cornice and a parapet (topped with a balustrade in some cases). ;46a Regency Square Number 46a Regency Square stands partly in the square and partly in the passageway opposite the Regency Tavern. It is thought to have been the last property to be completed. Originally built as a single storey architect's studio, it acquired an upper storey in the 1960s and is now a two- storey stucco-faced cottage with three windows on the first floor and a fourth in a recessed wing on the east side. The flat roof sits behind a parapet. The ground floor has a broad single window flanked by decorative panels. A cornice runs between the two storeys, and projects forward over the right-aligned entrance. ;46b Regency Square Number 46b Regency Square is squeezed into a narrow corner between number 47 and the Regency Tavern. It has three storeys, a single-window range and much ornamentation. The ground floor is a 20th- century alteration. Above it, pilasters with banded rustication rise to the level of the parapet. They are broken at second-floor level by a small balcony with balustrades. The window above this has a round arch, a moulded archivolt, a keystone with acanthus decoration and thin pilasters topped with capitals in the form of leaves. ;47–49 Regency Square Numbers 47–49 Regency Square are noticeably different from the rest of the square. All three have a single canted bay window to each of three storeys, topped with an architrave supported on pilasters with capitals. However, the canted bay windows are late 19th century alterations. When built in 1832, the houses were variously bow- windowed or flat fronted. Each house also has a cornice and parapet. Number 47's doorway is straight-headed, but the other two houses have round-arched entrances. Sir John Simpson's South African War Memorial ;War memorial A memorial commemorating 152 members of the Royal Sussex Regiment who died in the Second Boer War stands at the south end of Regency Square's garden, facing King's Road and the sea. It was erected in 1904, and takes the form of a square pedestal topped by an entablature and pediment. Originally of Portland stone with some bronze and stucco, the bronze parts have now been obscured. A bronze trumpeter stands on top of the entablature. Local architect Sir John Simpson designed the memorial and Charles Hartwell sculpted it. The memorial's unveiling ceremony, conducted by William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny, was on 29 October 1904. ;Regency Tavern The Regency Tavern's main façade faces north into the passageway leading to Russell Square, and has a six-window range. The side wall, facing into Regency Square, has two windows to each of the three storeys. The frontage is assumed to be mostly original, although it was built, in 1829, as a row of three individual houses, which merged into a single establishment in two phases in the late 19th and mid 20th centuries. The frontage has been augmented by modern iron columns. All but one of the windows are original sashes; those on the first floor of the Regency Square elevation have architraves which join the sill of the second-floor window directly above. There are stuccoed panels between these windows as well, and some of the north-facing windows also have panelling in their spandrels. A tall parapet rises above the cornice. ;Bollards Two cast-iron bollards in the passageway outside the Regency Tavern are also listed at Grade II. They were erected in the mid-19th century, and are fluted along their length. One has the name of its local founder at the bottom. On 31 December 2012, one was broken and was replaced with a smaller plain bollard instead of a facsimile, causing controversy locally. Social aspects Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, attracting the social elite. The square gradually lost its prestige status after World War I as hotels started to move in. Although most of the houses had become hotels by the mid-20th century, the majority have since been converted into flats and the square today is overwhelmingly residential. Military bands gave a performance in the garden in 1831 and 1849, and again in 1904 at the unveiling of the Royal Sussex Regiment Memorial, but the residents' committees strove to ensure that the garden was mainly a quiet space for residents. In the 1890s, temporary tennis courts were marked out on the lawn. During World War II air-raid shelters were built on the square and an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969. Number 1 Regency Square, later known as St Albans House and now numbered 131 King's Road, is \\"historically the most interesting house in the square\\". Amon Henry Wilds designed and built it in 1829, William Izard laid out the interior. The house was one of the most important social venues in Brighton between 1830 and the Duchess's death in 1837. She was born Harriet Mellon in 1777, became an actress, married banker Thomas Coutts in 1815, and inherited his fortune when he died in 1822—thereby becoming England's richest woman. After being courted by many men, she met and married William Beauclerk, the 9th Duke of St Albans, and they became regular visitors to Brighton. From 1830, their prolonged stays at No. 1 Regency Square were so frequent that it was named St Albans House. For the next seven years, it was the venue for lavish balls and extensive feasts, with hundreds of upper-class guests. The Duke was the Grand Falconer of England and occsionally displayed his falcons in the Regency Square garden. St Albans House had a nearby riding school which supposedly had the second largest unsupported interior space and the second largest dome in England, behind Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral respectively. (Part of the Bedford Hotel now occupies the site.) Two other famous characters paid an unintentional visit to Regency Square at the end of the 19th century: Oscar Wilde and his lover Lord Alfred Douglas crashed their horse and carriage into the railings of the gardens. Local newspapers reported the story with interest, but Wilde dismissed it as \\"an accident of no importance\\"—possibly a punning allusion to one of his best-known plays. Some of Regency Square's buildings are currently hotels. The Beach Hotel occupies numbers 2–4, the three houses north of St Albans House. Hotel Pelirocco occupies numbers 9 and 10; Hotel 360 is at number 12; and the West Pier Hotel (at numbers 14–15) and Topps Hotel (numbers 16–18) also occupy the west side of the square. There are three hotels on the north side: the Regency at number 28, the Prince Regent at number 29, and the Artist Residence at number 33. The east side has Adelaide House (number 51), Brighton House (number 52), Hotel Una (numbers 55–56), and the Queensbury Hotel (number 58).

Bellin, 18th century French Florida (modern French: Floride française) was a colonial territory established by French Huguenot colonists in what is now Florida between 1562 and 1565. The colonial endeavour was started following plans by the French Huguenot leader, Admiral of France Gaspard de Coligny, to establish New World colonies where his persecuted Protestant coreligionists could safely establish themselves.Sixteenth century North America: the land and the people by Carl Ortwin Sauer p.196 The first such attempt was an establishment in Brazil, named France Antarctique. A first landing in Florida was made by Jean Ribault, and a second by René Goulaine de Laudonnière in 1562, before moving north where he set up Charlesfort, on Parris Island, South Carolina. Charlesfort was abandoned by all colonists, save one, the following year due to hardship and internal conflicts, and they sailed back to France. In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière again traveled from France, this time to establish Fort Caroline, in what is now Jacksonville. The French establishment was wiped out by the Spanish in 1565. With the capture of Fort Caroline, Huguenots either fled into the wild mainland or were killed in the subsequent massacre at Matanzas Inlet. In 1568, Dominique de Gourgue further explored the area, and, with the help of his allies the Saturiwa Indians, massacred the Spanish garrison in retaliation, but he did not capitalize on this action.

Before the botnet itself was dismantled on 23 December 2009, it consisted of up to 12 million unique IP addresses or up to 1 million individual zombie computers infected with the \\"Butterfly (mariposa in Spanish) Bot\\", making it one of the largest known botnets.  History  = Origins and initial spread = The botnet was originally created by the DDP Team (Spanish: Días de Pesadilla Team, English: Nightmare Days Team), using a malware program called \\"Butterfly bot\\", which was also sold to various individuals and organisations. The goal of this malware program was to install itself on an uninfected PC, monitoring activity for passwords, bank credentials and credit cards. After that the malware would attempt to self-propagate to other connectible systems using various supported methods, such as MSN, P2P and USB. After completing its initial infection routine the malware would contact a command-and-control servers within the botnet. This command and control server could be used by the controllers of the botnet, in order to issue orders to the botnet itself. = Operations and impact = The operations executed by the botnet were diverse, in part because parts of the botnet could be rented by third party individuals and organizations. Confirmed activities include denial-of-service attacks, e-mail spam, theft of personal information, and changing the search results a browser would display in order to show advertisements and pop-up ads. Due to the size and nature of a botnet its total financial and social impact is difficult to calculate, but initial estimates calculated that the removal of the malware alone could cost \\"tens of millions of dollars\\". After the apprehension of the botnet's operators government officials also discovered a list containing personal details on 800,000 individuals, which could be used or sold for Identity theft purposes. = Dismantling = In May 2009 the Mariposa Working Group (MWG) was formed as an informal group, composed of Defence Intelligence, the Georgia Tech Information Security Center and Panda Security, along with additional unnamed security researchers and law enforcement agencies. The goal of this group was the analysis and extermination of the Mariposa botnet itself. On 23 December 2009 the Mariposa Working Group managed to take control of the Mariposa Botnet, after seizing control of the command-and-control servers used by the botnet. The operational owners of the botnet eventually succeeded in regaining control over the botnet, and in response launched a denial-of-service attack on Defence Intelligence. The attack itself managed to knock out Internet connectivity for a large share of the ISP's customers, which included several Canadian universities and government agencies.

Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130 (1982), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States holding that an Indian tribe has the authority to impose taxes on non-Indians that are conducting business on the reservation as an inherent power under their tribal sovereignty.. Nordhaus, Robert, Hall, G. Emlen and Rudio, Anne Alise (2003), Revisiting Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe: Robert Nordhaus and Sovereign Indian Control over Natural Resources on Reservations, 43 Nat. Resources J. 223 Background =History= Jicarilla Apache Reservation (in purple) The Jicarilla Apache Tribe is a Native American (Indian) tribe in northwestern New Mexico on a reservation of . The reservation was established by an Executive Order of President Grover Cleveland in 1887 and clarified by the Executive Orders of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 and William Howard Taft in 1912. The tribe adopted a formal constitution under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act, et seq. that provided for the taxation of members of the tribe and non-members of the tribe doing business on the reservation. If the tribe enacted a such tax ordinance on non-members, the ordinance had to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Beginning in 1953, the tribe entered into agreements with oil companies, including the plaintiffs Merrion and Bayless, to provide oil and gas leases. The leases were approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (now the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or BIA) in accordance with . As was the usual practice at the time, the oil companies negotiated directly with BIA, who then presented the contracts to the tribal council. While the oil and gas was from reservation land, Merrion paid severance taxes to the state of New Mexico under the provisions of , where Congress had authorized such taxation in 1927. The leases provided for royalties to be paid to the tribe, but the BIA was lax in collecting them. In 1973, tribal attorneys wrote to the BIA to demand the collection of royalties, and after a year delay, the BIA would only state that they were \\"looking into it.\\" In 1976, the BIA approved a tribal ordinance that also provided for a severance tax. This tax was set at 29 cents (U.S.) per barrel of oil and at 5 cents per million British thermal units (BTU) for natural gas. =District court= Merrion did not want to pay a severance tax to both New Mexico and the tribe, and filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, along with such major companies as Atlantic Richfield (now part of BP), Getty Oil, Gulf Oil, and Phillips Petroleum (now ConocoPhillips), among others. The case was not filed until 15 days before the severance tax was due. In the hearing on the temporary injunction on June 17, 1977, Merrion argued that the tribe's severance tax was unconstitutional, violating both the Commerce clause and Equal protection clause, and that it was both taxation without representation and double taxation. In addition, the plaintiffs argued against the entire concept of tribal sovereignty, stating that it had been a \\"legal fiction for decades.\\" U.S. District Judge H. Vearle Payne granted the temporary injunction and set the hearing on the permanent injunction for August 29, 1977. The oil companies showed up with approximately 40-50 attorneys, compared to 2 or 3 lawyers for the tribe. Both sides made essentially the same arguments as for the temporary injunction. Following the hearing, District court ruled that the tribe's tax violated the Commerce clause of the Constitution and that only state and local authorities had the ability to tax mineral rights on Indian reservations. The court then issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the collection of the tax by the tribe. =Circuit court= The case then went to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The western states of Utah, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming filed amici curiae briefs in support of the oil companies, while the Navajo Nation, the Arapahoe Nation, the Shoshone Indian Tribe, the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, and the National Congress of American Indians all filed briefs in support of the Jacrilla tribe. The case was heard on May 29, 1979 by a three-judge panel consisting of Chief Judge Oliver Seth and Circuit Judges William Holloway, Jr. and Monroe G. McKay. The arguments were the same as at the district court level, with the oil companies stating that tribal sovereignty did not apply to taxation of non-Indians conducting business on the reservation. In an unusual move, no written decision was issued, and the attorneys were told to reargue the case en banc. McKay stated that as he recalls, he and Holloway were in disagreement with Seth, who favored a limited view of the tribe's authority to tax the oil companies. On September 12, 1979, the case was reheard before the entire panel. Following that hearing, in a 5-2 decision, the Tenth Circuit reversed the District Court, holding that the tribe had the inherent power under their tribal sovereignty to impose taxes on the reservation. The court also held that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause nor place an undue burden on the oil companies. Opinion of the Court =Initial arguments= The oil companies immediately appealed and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case. This appeal came shortly after the Supreme Court had decided Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, , which had stated that an Indian tribe did not have the authority to try a non-Indian for a crime committed on the reservation.Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, The Oliphant case was a major blow against tribal sovereignty, and was a case used by the oil companies in their briefs. The oil companies argued that Oliphant, currently limited to criminal cases, should be expanded to civil matters as well. The attorneys for the tribe argued that this case was no different than Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, , which stated that tribes had the authority to impose a cigarette tax on both tribal members and non-Indians alike.Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, Amici briefs were filed by Montana, North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Washington (state), the Mountain States Legal Foundation, the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District, Shell Oil, and Westmoreland Resources in support of the oil companies. The Council of Energy Resource Tribes and the Navajo Nation filed briefs supporting the tribe. Arguing for Mellion and Bayless was Jason W. Kellahin, for Amoco and Marathon Oil was John R. Cooney (originally a separate case, but which was consolidated with this case), for the tribe was Robert J. Nordhaus, and on behalf of the tribe for the Solicitor General was Louis F. Claiborne. Kellahin argued that tribal sovereignty only extended to members of the tribe, citing both Oliphant and Montana v. United States, ,Montana v. United States, both cases involving the jurisdiction of a tribal court over non-Indians. Kellahin stated that those cases that allowed a tribe to tax non-Indians were not due to tribal sovereignty, but were connected with the authority of the tribe to regulate who could enter the reservation, in the same manner as a landlord controlled their property. Cooney argued that the tax was a violation of the Commerce Clause, in that Congress divested the tribes of that authority when they enacted granting the states the right to impose a severance tax on reservation lands. Nordhaus, in arguing for the tribe, pointed out that there was first, no Congressional preemption of the tribal authority to tax, and that second, taxation was an inherent power of tribal sovereignty. Claiborne first distinguished Montana, noting that it dealt with non-Indians on fee land owned by non-Indians that happened to be within the boundaries of the reservation, something that was completely unrelated to the current case. =Re-argument= Following the oral argument, the Chief Justice assigned Justice John Paul Stevens to write the majority opinion and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to write the minority or dissenting opinion, based on the initial count of the justices' views. Since Justice Potter Stewart did not participate in the case, it would take a 5-3 vote to overturn the decision of the Circuit Court. Stevens circulated a memorandum stating that his decision would be to invalidate the tax - Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist immediately stated they would join his opinion. Justice Byron White stated that he would wait and see what the dissent said, and then indicated he would join the dissent in part. It also appeared that Justice Harry Blackmun was also going to write a separate dissent, but he also stated that he would wait to see Marshall's opinion. At this point, the tribe had the votes to win on a 4-4 vote, but the Court was close to being adjourned for the summer recess. On July 3, 1981, the Court notified the parties to reargue the case on November 4, 1981. In the meantime, the Court had changed. Justice Stewart retired, and President Ronald Reagan had appointed Sandra Day O'Connor to replace him. During the re- argument, Kellahin began with the fact the New Mexico was acquired via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo and that neither Spain or Mexico recognized Indian title and claimed that the tax was a veiled attempt to increase royalty payments. Cooney argued that there was no authority in statute for the Secretary of the Interior to approve a tribal tax and that the 1927 statute preempted the tribes authority in favor of the states being empowered to apply a severance tax on reservations. Nordhaus stated that the argument about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo did not apply, since no branch of the federal government had ever differentiated between these tribes and other tribes. The case was then submitted to the court. =Majority opinion= Justice Thurgood Marshall, author of the majority opinion Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the court. Marshall noted that the tribe had a properly formed constitution, approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and that it included that the tribal council may impose taxes on non-members doing business on the reservation. He noted that the tribe had executed oil and gas leases for about 69% of the reservation and that the leases provided for royalties to be paid to the tribe. Marshall further noted that the tribe followed the proper process to enact a severance tax, obtaining the approval of the BIA as part of the process. The first argument of the oil companies that the power to tax only arose from the power of the tribe to exclude persons from the reservation. Marshall disagreed, stating that the power to tax is an inherent attribute of a tribe's sovereignty. Tribal government includes the need to provide for services, not only to the tribe, but to anyone doing business on the reservation. He noted that the oil companies benefited from police protection and other governmental services. Citing Colville, he stated that the tribe's interest in raising \\"revenues for essential governmental programs . . . is strongest when the revenues are derived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the Tribes and when the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services.\\" Marshall noted that Congress was able to remove this power, but had not done so, and had acknowledged in 1879 the power of the Cherokee Nation to tax non-Indians. Marshall further noted the oil companies' arguments that a lease would prevent a governmental body from later imposing a tax would denigrate tribal sovereignty, and that tribal sovereignty was not limited by contractual arrangements. Only the Federal government has the authority to limit the powers of a tribal government, and a non-Indian's consent is not needed (by contract or otherwise) to exercise its sovereignty, to the contrary, the tribe may set conditions and limits on the non-Indian as a matter of right. \\"To presume that a sovereign forever waives the right to exercise one of its sovereign powers unless it expressly reserves the right to exercise that power in a commercial agreement turns the concept of sovereignty on its head.\\" Marshall then addressed the Commerce Clause issues, and the argument of the Solicitor General that the section of the Commerce Clause that dealt directly with Indians applied rather than the argument of the oil companies that the section dealing with interstate commerce applied. First, Marshall noted that the case history of the Indian Commerce Clause was to protect the tribes from state infringement, not to approve of Indian trade without constitutional restraint. He saw of no reason to begin now, especially since he did not find that the tribe's severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce. In a 6-3 decision, Marshall found that the tribe had the right to impose such a tax on non-Indians. =Dissent= Justice John Paul Stevens, author of the dissent Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist, dissented from the majority opinion. Stevens noted that over its own members, a tribe has virtually unlimited sovereignty. Over non-Indians, a tribe had no power, but many tribes were granted the authority to exclude non-Indians from their reservations. Stevens also noted that the various statutes that were passed in regards to mineral rights and leases were silent as to the authority of a tribe to impose taxes. Therefore, authority must come from one of three sources, federal statutes, treaties, and inherent tribal sovereignty. He noted that in matters involving their own members, the tribe could act in manners that the federal government could not, such as discriminating against females in citizenship cases (citing Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, ).Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, Tribal authority over non-members was always severely limited, in both a civil and criminal context, and he viewed both Oliphant and Montana as controlling in this area also. He viewed the authority to tax as merely an adjunct to the tribe's right to exclude individuals from the reservation. Since the leases were entered into by the tribe voluntarily, the tribe cannot enact later taxes without the consent of the oil companies. Stevens would have reversed the Circuit Court. Subsequent developments Almost immediately after the decision, the BIA, on directions from Assistant Secretary of the Interior Kenneth Smith, proposed federal regulations that would have severely limited the ability of the tribes to impose severance taxes. Following numerous complaints from the tribes, the BIA abandoned that plan. The Jicarilla tribe has also purchased the Palmer Oil Company, becoming the first Indian tribe to have 100% ownership of an oil production firm. The case is a landmark case in Native American case law, having been cited in approximately 400 law review articles as of July 2010.Bowen, Veronica L.

In the sixteenth century the Deane family were Lords of the Manor of Great Maplestead. Later in the century the manor passed by marriage to Sir John Tyndal, Master of the Court of Chancery. It was here in 1618 that Tyndal's daughter Margaret Tyndal Winthrop married John Winthrop, a crucial figure in the founding of Massachusetts. In the 1870s the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales said that Great Maplestead \\"took its name from maple trees, which anciently flourished on or around its site; and has the repute of being a very healthy place\\".  Location  This village is located in the north of Essex, which is in the South East of England and is near the town of Halstead and the villages of Sible Hedingham and Little Maplestead. The closest city to Great Maplestead is Colchester, which is in central Essex. There is a distance of 46.501 miles between London and Great Maplestead. The village covers 1892 acres of land and is located one mile to the North East of the Colne Valley railway, and also the Colne river  Population  Total population of Great Maplestead Civil Parish, Essex, as reported by the Census of Population from 1801–2011 It had a population of 343 according to the 2011 census. The population over the last 50 years has remained stable, with Great Maplestead having a population of 331 in 1961. The population of Great Maplestead has not dramatically varied since the census taken in 1801, to the one taken in 2011. The population in 1801 was 331, the same as in 1961, and only a small difference in the population from 2011. However, there have been some fluctuations that have occurred through time. Between 1801 and 1851 there was a steady increase in the population until it reached its highest recorded population of 494 in 1851. Between this time and 1881 Great Maplestead experienced a significant decrease, with the population dropping to 394. From 1881 onwards the population remained at a relatively constant rate with no dramatic changes. =Housing= In 1831 there was a recorded 88 houses, this links to the changing population as the number of houses began to rise, with the highest number being 111 households in 1851, with 105 of these occupied and six vacant. 1851 was also the year with the highest recorded population. Over the next couple of decades the number of households declined, also seeing the highest number of vacant houses, with there being the highest number of 14 in 1881. However the housing rate again increased in the mid twentieth century. Employment A graph to show the occupations of the Great Maplestead population in 2011. A graph to show occupation data for 1881 in Great Maplestead. Employment in Great Maplestead has changed significantly between 1881 and 2011, with the most change shown in the change in occupation over the years. In 1881 there were a high number of occupations that were unknown, with 55 females having an unknown occupation. Whereas in 2011, 172 residents were recorded in Great Maplestead aged between 16 and 74 in employment. Great Maplestead’s largest sectors in 1881 were mainly primary and secondary, representative of the time. A high proportion of the population were employed in agriculture, with around 57 males working in this sector. Other popular occupations in 1881 were domestics and textile workers, with 45 females working within households performing domestic services.

Around 95 people in Great Maplestead have a job as managers, directors, senior officials, associate, technical, administrative and secretarial roles. Over time the main occupations of the population have moved away from the primary and secondary role, towards occupations such as these, with a large proportion of Great Maplestead involved within such occupations. However the 'skilled trade' sector in 2011, like manual workers dohave a relatively large number of people, around 30, working in this sector. A map showing Great Maplestead and the surrounding area from the 20th century. St Giles Church :St Giles' Church is well known within Great Maplestead, located in the centre of the village containing 3 bells in the tower, with the first one being built in the 15th century. It is run by reverend Gay Ellis and runs weekly Sunday services. The church is made of two parts, the Norman building was built first, followed by the Deane Chapel which was built in the year 1626. In 1612 the church had to be partially rebuilt with red bricks due to the fact it was struck by lightning. Education :Great Maplestead is home to the primary school St. Giles C of E Primary. The school has existed since 1863. The primary school adopted the same name as the St. Giles church as the vicar and church wardens became trustees after the idea of the school was presented by Mrs Mary Gee. She created the idea of a school in 1836, when she opened a charity school, her idea then became a reality when she was presented a piece of land where she was able to build the school where it currently stands now. The school was open to both boys and girls and has made many improvements over the years, starting off with just two classrooms. Since then three more classrooms have been built, and well as a school hall. Through time other essentials have also been added, such as installing the schools first telephone in 1955. The governing body for St. Giles C of E Primary school have created future plans for the school, including plans to bring the school from 'Good' to 'Outstanding'.

It was opened in 1847 by the Midland Railway on the Erewash Valley Line at the junction of a short branch to the town itself. The station became known locally as Ilkeston Junction, and when first opened had no road leading from it to either Cossall or Ilkeston. Passengers would use farm tracks and the canal towpath to reach its isolated location.Shaw, G & Miller, P, (2012) Railway Tales - Ilkeston and District in the Age of Steam, Ilkeston: Ilkeston & District Local History Society In 1870 a proper road ('Station Road' or 'Station Street') was completed to the station from Ilkeston, the original station closing in that year after completion of a new station further north. The new station opened on 2 May 1870; originally named Ilkeston, it was renamed Ilkeston Junction on 1 July 1879, and Ilkeston Junction and Cossall on 1 December 1890. It carried a shuttle service to Ilkeston Town railway station which was never particularly popular since the GNR provided a direct main line service.Kingscott, G., (2007) Lost Railways of Derbyshire, Newbury: Countryside Books Some services were also provided to Nottingham and Chesterfield.Anderson, P.H., (1985 2nd. ed.)

The same was true of Nottingham trains when they ran on the short-lived branch between Bennerley Junction and Basford. In the Grouping of all lines (into four main companies) in 1923 the station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway . The branch closed in 1960 (although passenger traffic had ceased by the late 1940s) and the tracks were lifted, with the junction station finally closing to all traffic on 2 January 1967. There were several subsequent proposals for a new station to be opened on the Erewash Line,BBC News: Funds sought for Ilkeston railway station with Ilkeston often quoted in the press as being 'the largest town in England without a railway station'.BBC East Midlands Today As part of the new station fund set out in March 2013, Ilkeston, Pye Corner and Lea Bridge were narrowed down as the three most likely stations to open or reopen, with the final announcement being made in May.

Its major competitors in the market are the cameras based on the micro 4/3 standard created by Panasonic and Olympus, and a few low end Canon, Nikon, and even Sony α DSLRs. The NEX-5 shoots 14.2 megapixel stills and has a 7 frame/s continuous shotmode.http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId;=10151&langId;=-1&productId;=8198552921666192716 It has the capability to shoot 1920×1080i at 60 frame/s in AVCHD or 1440×1080p at 30 frame/s in MPEG4. The NEX-5 was replaced by the 16 megapixel NEX-5N in August 2011. Features The α NEX-5 has features found in SLR cameras but also some that are normally found in point and shoots. The body of the α NEX-5 is made of magnesium alloy that separates the NEX-5 from the less expensive polymer NEX-3. Also different from the NEX-3 is video quality. The NEX-5 can shoot in AVCHD 1080/60i HD. There is a 7 frame/s continuous shot mode, with autofocus disabled after the first frame. The APS-C sized sensor has an ISO sensitivity up to 12,800. The camera software has special features like twilight mode and sweep panorama. The latter lets the photographer sweep across a city-sky line or similar long view and have the photos automatically stitched into a JPEG image on camera.http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/nex-compact- camera-system/range/nex-5 NEX-5 Lenses Sony NEX-5N with an E-mount SEL1855 lens The NEX-5 along with its sister, the NEX-3, and also the Sony Handycam NEX-VG10 use a new lens mount system developed by Sony for NEX series and known as the Sony E-mount. Initially, there were three available lenses: an all-purpose 18–55 mm lens, an ultra wide pancake 16 mm lens, and a wide range 18–200 mm E-mount lens. With the post-November 2010 firmware version 3 installed, and by using the (roughly US$200) Sony LA-EA1 adapter, the NEX series of cameras is able to electronically control the aperture and autofocus of Sony SSM/SAM A-mount lenses, and control the aperture of the other Sony/Minolta A-mount lenses with manual focus only. The (roughly US$400) Sony LA-EA2 adapter also supports autofocus with screw-drive A-mount lenses, firmware version 5 is required for this adapter. Minolta MD 2/85 mm adapted to NEX 5 Other third-party mechanical tube adapters are also available. These adapters enable the use of Canon FD-mount, Canon EF-mount (without aperture control), Contax G, M42 screw mount, Konica Hexanon AR-mount, Minolta SR-mount (MC/MD), Leica M and screw mount, Nikon F-mount (non-G), Pentax K-mount (non- DA), T2 screw mount and Minolta/Konica Minolta/Sony A-mount lenses. The E-mount flange register is so short that it is possible to mount 45 mm or longer-focal-length non-focusing enlarging lenses on the NEX body, with the use of an intermediate focusing helicoid behind them. Certain third-party mechanical adapters also provide circular control rings that provide some mechanical control of the aperture of Nikon G, Pentax DA and Canon EF lenses, as these do not have a mechanical aperture control ring on their lens barrels.

He was the physician to the Duke of Gloucester. He was born in Ormskirk, Lancashire, in 1746. After graduating with an M.D. at Edinburgh in 1770, where his thesis, De Febribus intermittentibus, was published, he exercised his profession in his native town until about 1776, when he succeeded to the practice of Dr. Matthew Dobson, in Liverpool, on Dobson's retirement to Bath. He was appointed to the staff of the Infirmary in 1780, and was the first doctor in Liverpool to realise the value of applying cold water on fever. This remedy was described by Brandreth in a paper entitled On the Advantages arising from the Topical Application of Cold Water and Vinegar in Typhus and On the Use of Large Doses of Opium in certain cases. He remained in Liverpool for the remainder of his life, and became an eminently successful and popular practitioner. He was a man of wide and various reading, and possessed a most accurate and tenacious memory, which he attributed to his habit of depending on it without referring to notes. He established the Dispensary at Liverpool in 1778, and for thirty years gave great attention to the Infirmary. The Infirmary had 84 beds, and Joseph and other senior physicians and surgeons gave their services free of charge. The discovery of the utility of applying cold in fever is ascribed to him. This remedy he described in a paper On the Advantages arising from the Topical Application of Cold Water and Vinegar in Typhus, and on the Use of Large Doses of Opium in certain Cases. Joseph Brandreth lived in the heart of Liverpool during his practise for some time, in Church Street. He died in Liverpool, 10 April 1815. The most famous physician in Liverpool at this time was James Currie, who also led a distinctive life devoted to the services of mankind. Alongside Currie, Brandreth was presented with the freedom of the borough in 1802. Brandreth is also considered one of the leading physicians of Liverpool during the end of the 18th century.  Early life and family  Joseph Brandreth was born in the small market town of Olmskirk, a market town situated in south west Lancashire, England, in 1746. Ormskirk is situated on what was the ancient highway between Liverpool and Preston. He married Catherine Pilkington, born on 28 November 1751, the daughter of John Pilkington of Anderton and his wife Catherine Shaw. The marriage lasted 35 years, and produced 5 children. The family lived at 3 Paradise Street, as well as 44 School Lane in Liverpool.  Commemorations  The Brandeth Club of Ormskirk was founded by the late Dr. Gerard Sanderson, Consultant Physician to the Ormskirk and District National Hospital, and named after Joseph Brandreth who had lived in Ormskirk and, in his day, achieved great distinction as a physician. There is an impressive memorial to Joseph Brandreth in his hometown of Ormskirk, in the parish church, which has the following inscription: > The Good Samaritan Memorial in Ormskirk Parish church to Dr. Joseph > Brandreth SACRED to the MEMORY of JOSEPH BRANDRETH MD PHYSICIAN to HIS ROYAL > HIGHNESS the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER The Rt.

It was opened in 1847 by the Midland Railway. This station was connected to the Erewash Valley Line by a short branch from Ilkeston Junction, the route of which roughly followed the present Millership Way and which was served by horse-drawn railway carriages for some years.Shaw, G & Miller, P, (2012) Railway Tales - Ilkeston and District in the Age of Steam, Ilkeston: Ilkeston & District Local History Society By 1853, three trains were running daily each way between Nottingham and Ilkeston via Long Eaton. However, local newspapers contain many letters of complaint in the 1850s and 1860s regarding the poor standard of waiting rooms and other facilities at the local stations and even about the rudeness of the staff. Some of the Midland Railway’s Directors, their General Manager and Engineer visited Ilkeston in 1860 to discuss rail users’ concerns, although little seems to have been accomplished from the visit. The original station, opened on 6 September 1847 and named Ilkeston, was closed on 2 May 1870 but remodelled in response to the arrival of the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) Derbyshire Extension line through its station later known as Ilkeston North. The station, now named Ilkeston Town, re-opened on 1 July 1879. It carried a shuttle service from Ilkeston Junction which was never particularly popular since the GNR provided a direct main line service.Kingscott, G., (2007) Lost Railways of Derbyshire, Newbury: Countryside Books Some services were also provided to Nottingham and Chesterfield Anderson, P.H., (1985 2nd. ed.) Forgotten Railways Part 2: The East Midlands, Trowbridge: David and Charles (distributor) From 1882 the former were routed along the Bennerley Junction route to Basford, with six services a day, but they ended at the beginning of the First World War.Kingscott, G., (2004) Lost Railways of Nottinghamshire, Newbury: Countryside Books In the Grouping of all lines (into four main companies) in 1923 the station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway . The station closed to passengers on 10 July 1950, having been open on a restricted basis since 16 June 1947, and goods operations had ceased by 1960. The tracks were lifted and the footbridge removed. The site is now occupied by a roundabout at the end of Ilkeston's Chalons Way by-pass and a large Tesco supermarket. The route of the track roughly followed the recently built road named 'Millership Way'.

It details the continuing adventures of Locke Lamora and Jean Tannen, as well as Sabetha, Locke's previously absent love interest. The book was released on October 8, 2013 in the US and October 10 2013 in the UK & Commonwealth. It is published by Random House and Orion. Synopsis The book begins with the first meeting of Locke and Sabetha, the woman that he has been in love with throughout the series but has not been introduced until this book. Sabetha and Locke meet when they are still part of the child thief gang and she is charged with guiding him. After this flashback, the scene shifts to the fallout from Red Seas Under Red Skies where Locke is dying and Jean is charged with helping him. Patience, of the Bondsmagi appears and offers the pair a deal. They can work with her faction of the Bondsmagi in order to rig elections in exchange for money and Locke's life. The catch is the fact that Sabetha is working for the other side. From this point, the book switches between flashbacks concerning Locke and Sabetha learning from Father Chains and the present games between Sabetha and Locke. Plot summary The book begins with the first meeting of Locke and Sabetha, the woman that he has been in love with throughout the series but who has not been introduced until this book. Sabetha and Locke meet when they are still part of the Shade's Hill gang under the Thiefmaker and she's charged with making sure he and two other troublemakers do not get caught. After this, Locke falls for her but does not get to see her often. He stays awake at night looking for her. One day, Locke returns to Shade's Hill to hear from the older children that Sabetha has drowned and he will never see her again. After this flashback, the scene shifts to the fallout from Red Seas Under Red Skies where Locke is dying and Jean is working to save his life. Jean brings each Physiker, or doctor, to Locke in hopes that they can save him. Jean kidnaps a physiker who has been unwilling to help. He is unable to help, but Locke and Jean soon have a party of thieves beating them due to kidnapping the physiker. Patience, of the Bondsmagi, appears after they have been beaten and offers the pair a deal. They can work with her faction of the Bondsmagi in order to rig elections, in favor of the Deep Roots Party, in exchange for money and Locke's life. They agree. After agreeing, the Bondsmagi carry Locke to the ship to Karthain while Jean walks. Once aboard, they bring Locke to a special room where they will perform the healing. During the healing, Locke sees his dead associate, Bug, with blackened eyes warning him. The ceremony is finally complete and Locke is alive and hungry. The Bondsmagi are all extremely tired from helping. Afterward they learn that Sabetha is working for the other side, the Black Iris party, and has been there a few days When they arrive in Karthain, they play a number of childish pranks back and forth. Locke is tricked by Sabetha and he and Jean awaken on a luxurious boat. Locke and Jean barely escape this boat by cutting off a small boat and escaping to shore. After a multiple day journey back to the Karthain, Locke and Sabetha make a truce for the safety of themselves and Jean to prevent issues and ensure a good show for the Bondsmagi. The elections continue and near the end Patience explains to Locke and Sabetha that Locke may be an ancient Bondsmagi who successfully moved from one body to the body of a child. The cost of this was the plague mentioned in previous books. The final election result is 10 – 9 in favor of the Black Iris party. One of Locke's schemes plays out and a key Black Iris member changes his position to neutral making the final result 9 – 9 – 1. Locke, Jean and Sabetha escape Karthain. Locke awakes in the night to find Patience there and Sabetha gone. Patience explains that Locke may or may not be the magi but she will not tell him. Sabetha has left after learning about this. Jean appears and Locke tells him he will respect Sabetha's wish for space and will only go after her if she would wish it. The epilogue gives a story about the Falconer and his journey regaining power. The epilogue ends with the Falconer killing his mother, Patience. Background This is the third book in the Gentleman Bastards series and it took the longest to write. Between the previous book and this one, Scott Lynch was diagnosed with depression and faced divorce.https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/geeks- guide-scott-lynch/ References Category:American fantasy novels Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books Category:Del Rey books Category:2013 American novels ","title":"The Republic of Thieves"},{"id":"28191234","text":"In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, a complete theory T is said to satisfy NIP (or \\"not the independence property\\") if none of its formulae satisfy the independence property, that is if none of its formulae can pick out any given subset of an arbitrarily large finite set. Definition Let T be a complete L-theory. An L-formula φ(x,y) is said to have the independence property (with respect to x, y) if in every model M of T there is, for each n = {0,1,…,n − 1} < ω, a family of tuples b0,…,bn−1 such that for each of the 2n subsets X of n there is a tuple a in M for which :M\\\\models\\\\varphi(\\\\boldsymbol{a},\\\\boldsymbol{b}_i)\\\\quad\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\quad i\\\\in X. The theory T is said to have the independence property if some formula has the independence property. If no L-formula has the independence property then T is called dependent, or said to satisfy NIP. An L-structure is said to have the independence property (respectively, NIP) if its theory has the independence property (respectively, NIP). The terminology comes from the notion of independence in the sense of boolean algebras. In the nomenclature of Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory, we may say that a collection S of subsets of X shatters a set B ⊆ X if every subset of B is of the form B ∩ S for some S ∈ S. Then T has the independence property if in some model M of T there is a definable family (Sa  a∈Mn) ⊆ Mk that shatters arbitrarily large finite subsets of Mk. In other words, (Sa  a∈Mn) has infinite Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension. Examples Any complete theory T that has the independence property is unstable.See Hodges. In arithmetic, i.e. the structure (N,+,·), the formula \\"y divides x\\" has the independence property.See Poizat, page 249. This formula is just :(\\\\exists k)(y\\\\cdot k=x). So, for any finite n we take the n 1-tuples bi to be the first n prime numbers, and then for any subset X of {0,1,…,n − 1} we let a be the product of those bi such that i is in X. Then bi divides a if and only if i ∈ X. Every o-minimal theory satisfies NIP.Pillay and Steinhorn, corollary 3.10 and Knight, Pillay, and Steinhorn, theorem 0.2. This fact has had unexpected applications to neural network learning.See Anthony and Bartlett for details. Examples of NIP theories include also the theories of all the following structures:See Simon, Appendix A. linear orders, trees, abelian linearly ordered groups, algebraically closed valued fields, and the p-adic field for any p.

Although there were a number of different incarnations of the group, the most notable fought in the Spanish War of Independence (1808–1814). History The Literary Battalion was first formed in 1663, in the face of the Portuguese attacks on the town of Monterrey, after the revolt of Portugal against Spain in 1640. It formed again in 1665, 1808 and in 1846 (during the Solís Uprising). However, the 1808 unit is by far the most famous. =1808 campaign= The unit was formed in 42 days, after a meeting held in the cloisters of the university presided over by Rafael Múzquiz, Archbishop of Compostela. In 1808, Juan Ignacio de Armada Caamaño Ibáñez de Mondragón y Salgado de Sotomayor (Marquis of Santa Cruz de Rivadulla) agreed to lead the unit and provide financial support. According to Alfonso Armada Comyn, the marquis at the time, \\"In order to be able to lead the university students he was made a doctor in all the faculties\\". The unit's colours (which are today preserved in the Assembly Hall of the Faculty of Law of the university) were the blue and white of the Flag of Galicia and carried two shields: that of the ancient Kingdom of Galicia and the coat of arms of the university. This was surmounted by a royal crown and an inscription. The soldiers also carried a scroll containing a brief poem: \\"To rescue Fernando (King Fernando VII) and to put an end to Bonaparte Minerva and Mars are united.\\" On 18 July 1808 the battalion left to join the troops of General Joaquín Blake, where the Navarrese volunteers were joined by the vanguard. Among the multiple recorded exploits was that of entering incognito the city of A Coruña, taken by French Marshal Michel Ney, to reconnoitre the batteries. In 1810 General Francisco Javier Castaños ordered the disbandment of the Literary Battalion, promoting the few survivors to the rank of officer in the military corps. =Remembrance= The plaque in Quintana Plaza A commemorative plaque in Quintana Plaza in the city of Santiago de Compostela bears the inscription: :A LOS HEROES DEL BATALLON LITERARIO DE 1808 :LOS ESCOLARES COMPOSTELANOS DE 1896 Y LOS AYUNTAMIENTOS DE 1822 1865 Y 1896 :(To the heroes of the Literary Battalion of 1808 :The Compostela scholars of 1896 and the city councils of 1822 1865 and 1896) References *Tettamancy Gastón, Francisco.

Such information may be e.g. an alert signal triggered when someone or something has breached a light curtain on a factory floor. While traditional safety solutions rely on dedicated communication lines connecting machinery and control systems via special relays, openSAFETY does not need any extra cables reserved for safety-related information. It is a bus-based protocol that allows for passing on safety data over existing Industrial Ethernet connections between end devices and higher-level automation systems – connections principally established and used for regular monitoring and control purposes. Unlike other bus-based safety protocols that are suitable for use only with a single or a few specific Industrial Ethernet implementations and are incompatible with other systems, openSAFETY works with a wide range of different Industrial Ethernet variants.  Certifications, approvals and key functionality  openSAFETY is certified according to IEC 61508IEC 61508 covers the Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems. and meets the requirements of SIL 3 applications. The protocol has been approved by national IEC committees representing over two dozen countries around the world, and has been released for international standardization in IEC 61784-3 FSCP 13.IEC 61784-3 covers Industrial communication networks - Profiles - Part 3: Functional safety fieldbuses.Hoske, Mark T. \\"IEC approves openSAFETY, bus- independent protocol.\\" Control Engineering website. 11 August 2010. openSAFETY supports functional features to enable fast data transfer such as direct communication between nodes on a network (cross-traffic) as well as a range of measures needed to ensure data integrity and accuracy, e.g. time stamps, unique data packet identifiers, and others.Lydon, Bill. \\"Multivendor Ethernet Safety Protocol - Noble Goal.\\" Automation website. April 2011. The article discusses major features of the technology. Lydon finds that the \\"concept could be simply an interesting idea but the openSAFETY group has published a number of testimonials from users,\\" and goes on to cite appraisals from senior management officials at a number of different companies including Alstom Power Automation & Controls and Nestlé Corporate Engineering. One particularly notable characteristic is openSAFETY's encapsulation of safety data within an Ethernet frame:See Chapter 3. Media Access Control (MAC) frame and packet specifications in the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard, Section One for details on standard Ethernet frame formats and the principle of data encapsulation. two subframes, each being an identical duplicate of the other, are combined to form the full safety frame. Each of the subframes is secured by its own checksum, which in effect provides multiple safeguards and levels of redundancy to ensure any distortions of safety data or other types of faults cannot go unnoticed.Detailed, up-to-date information on the protocol’s features and functions complementing and expanding on this brief characterization can be found on the official openSAFETY website (see External Links section).  Compatibility and open-source license  In contrast to all other bus-based safety solutions on the market, which were created to complement a specific Industrial Ethernet protocol or family of bus systems, openSAFETY was designed for general interoperability. Though openSAFETY was conceived by the Ethernet POWERLINK Standardization Group (EPSG) and originally developed as a safety companion to that organization’s own Industrial Ethernet variant, POWERLINK, the safety protocol is no longer bound to POWERLINK. Instead, it can be used with various major Industrial Ethernet implementations, namely PROFINET, SERCOS III, EtherNet/IP, Modbus-TCP, and POWERLINK.\\"Safety Technology Supports all Major Ethernet Protocols.\\" Industrial Engineering News March 2011 (vol. 37, no. 3): 26. The article reports that openSAFETY support for use with PROFINET systems had recently been added to complement the protocols' previously established compatibility with other bus systems like SERCOS III, Modbus TCP, EtherNet/IP, and POWERLINK. This broad compatibility with about 90% of the installed base of Industrial Ethernet installations in 2010\\"Three Variants Dominate Industrial Ethernet.\\" ControlDesign.com website. 29 April 2010. The article cites an IMS Research study that puts the combined market share of EtherNet/IP, PROFInet, Modbus TCP, and POWERLINK at 91%. is achieved because openSAFETY operates only on the topmost (application) layer of the network, where safety data can be trafficked irrespective of specific network characteristics that may differ from one underlying bus system to another. This approach is commonly known as \\"black channel\\" operation in communication protocol engineering.Verhappen, Ian. \\"The Hidden Network.\\" ControlGlobal.com website. 2 April 2011. Verhappen discusses the widespread use of the term in this field as well as the lack of a precise definition for it, and follows up with an actual examination of \\"black channel\\" safety data transfer.  Proof of concept presentation in 2010  A relatively late arrival on the scene,Specifications for competing solutions were released as early as 1999 in the case of PROFIsafe. openSAFETY was first released in 2009. It is based on its immediate precursor technology, POWERLINK Safety, which was originally launched in 2007. openSAFETY won broad public attention in April 2010, when a presentation at the Hannover Messe trade show in Germany showcased four different implementations of the safety solution running in SERCOS III, Modbus TCP, EtherNet/IP and POWERLINK environments.Presher, Al. \\"New OpenSAFETY Protocol.\\" DesignNews website. 10 July 2010. The public presentation and open-source release of the protocol was hotly debated, with strong reactions both in favor and against the new solution, which prompted extensive reporting in the trade press.While English- language periodicals have not focused as much on these controversial debates, reactions from a number of industry players are well documented in feature articles and interviews published in German trade magazines, e.g. in open automation (3/2010, p. 54-55), Computer & Automation (5/2010, p. 18-20), messtec drives Automation (6/2010, p. 36-37) and A&D; (9/2010, p. 65). Most articles indicate that openSAFETY was met with particularly vocal opposition from proponents of competing proprietary safety solutions, e.g. CIP Safety for SERCOS III. Following the major openSAFETY presentation in Hanover, proponents of the new solution gave lectures at other industry events as well, e.g. at TÜV Rheinland’s 9th International Symposium in Cologne, Germany, on 4–5 May 2010. Speaking at this conference on Functional Safety in Industrial Applications, Stefan Schönegger of Austria’s Bernecker + Rainer Industrie- Elektronik Ges.m.b.H. (B&R;), a co-creator and major advocate of openSAFETY, provided an introduction to key characteristics of the new protocol.Schönegger, Stefan. openSAFETY – The standard for safe communication. Reports on later gatherings indicate that the focus of presentations and discussions about the protocol soon shifted to specific implementation and applicability issues.\\"First Korea Industrial Ethernet Conference.\\" In its news section, the Industrial Ethernet Book website reports that about 140 participants attended presentations on \\"various aspects of the implementation of Powerlink and openSAFETY,\\" delivered by speakers who \\"presented reference projects as well as hardware components.\\"\\"Second Industrial Ethernet Conference in Paris.\\" Process Engineering Control & Maintenance.

He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leyton East from 1923 to 1924, and for Wandsworth Central from 1929 to 1931. Early life Church was born on 7 December 1866 in London, England and was educated at University College, London. He was a schoolmaster from 1909 to 1914 when he joined the Army at the start of the First World War. Military career Church served on the Western Front for three years with the Royal Artillery then the Royal Flying Corps. He was transferred to North Russia to command the Centre Column of the 237 Infantary Brigade. In January 1919, Church was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his service during the First World War, and in January 1920 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for action in the Murmansk Command during the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. The citation noted his \\"particular gallantry and zeal during the operations from Medevja-gora to Unitsa, 8 June to 26 July 1919\\". Political career ;Failed 1922 campaign Church first stood for Parliament at the 1922 general election, when he lost by a 35:65 ratio of votes in the Conservative- held part-rural, suburban Spelthorne seat.Craig, op. cit., page 427 ;Successful 1923 campaign and loss in 1924 At the 1923 general election he won the mainly urban Leyton East seat by a 7% margin from Unionist (Conservative) E.E. Alexander but the latter took it back in 1924 by the same rounded margin.Craig, op. cit., page 170 ;Successful 1929 campaign He took urban, more middle class, Wandsworth Central returning to the Commons at the next general election in 1929 general election. He took it from a recently knighted Conservative, noted in transport services. He won a slender majority of 300 votes (1.1% of the total). ;Eugenic voluntary sterilisation bill In July 1931, Church tabled a Ten Minute Rule Bill promoted by the Eugenics Education Society. Although the eugenics measure was \\"a Bill to enable mental defectives to undergo sterilizing operations or sterilizing treatment upon their own application, or that of their spouses or parents or guardians,\\" its underlying purpose was the eventual introduction of compulsory sterilisation, with Church describing it as \\"an experiment on a small scale so that later on we may have the benefit of the results and experience gained in order to come to conclusions before bringing in a Bill for the compulsory sterilisation of the unfit.\\" The Commons voted by 167 votes to 89 against any second reading. ;Move to NLO and failed 1931 campaign When the Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald left the party in 1931 to co-lead a Conservative-dominated National Government, Church was one of the few Labour MPs to support him. He followed MacDonald into the new National Labour Organisation then that year stood in the 1931 general election as a National Independent for the London University seat, where he lost by a 27:73 ratio against one candidate.Craig, op. cit., page 669 He stood again twice, as a National Labour (NLO) candidate: in Bristol East at the 1935 general electionCraig, op. cit., page 106 then in Derby at a by-election in July 1936,Craig, op. cit., page 124 and in Tottenham South as a \\"National\\" candidate at the 1945 general election but remained unelected after 1931.

Early life  Born in Aquasco, Maryland on September 7, 1912, Brady graduated from the University of Maryland in 1935. He then attended the General Theological Seminary, New York, graduating in 1938. He was married to Margaret and they had four children, Mary Margaret, Anne, William Jr. and Bernard. Priesthood After ordination to the diaconate in April 1938, and priesthood in November 1938, Brady served as assistant at the Church of the Resurrection, New York for two years. He was then called to serve as Rector of St. Paul’s, Savannah, Georgia. Over the next eight years (1940–1948), he is credited with \\"dramatically reducing the financial indebtedness of the Parish\\" and also \\"persuaded the Vestry to purchase a rectory\\". In retirement, Brady and his wife, Margaret (who was reared in the parish) remained devoted friends of St. Paul’s. Brady served on the Executive Council and Standing Committee and was also a Deputy to General Convention from the Diocese of Georgia. Brady served as Rector of St. Paul’s, Alton, Illinois and Priest-in-Charge of St. Gabriel’s Mission, Wood River, Illinois from 1948 to 1953. Brady served on the Standing Committee and was also a Deputy to General Convention from the Diocese of Springfield. Episcopate Brady was elected Bishop Coadjutor of the Diocese of Fond du Lac on November 11, 1952. His consecration took place February 24, 1953, where Bishop Harwood Sturtevant served as the Chief Consecrator. The diocese was basically a rural/town missionary diocese with 21 missions and 18 parishes. Bishop Brady served as Coadjutor for four years, during which time he lived in Stevens Point, Wisconsin since Bishop Sturtevant assigned him the parishes in the area then known as the Western Convocation in addition to all the missions of the diocese. On the retirement of Bishop Sturtevant, Brady's enthronement as diocesan took place at the Cathedral of St. Paul in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin on January 6, 1957. One process Brady immediately addressed had to do with diocesan investments. Bishop Sturtevant had handled these directly in consultation with diocesan treasurer, Andre Perry. Working with the Trustees of the Diocese, a decision was made to sell all of the investments currently held by the Diocese and pool the money as a common trust. Congregations were also able to participate in the pooling of these funds to gain the advantage that comes from larger pools of assets. In 1959, Bishop Brady formed the Apostolate Committee which discussed all aspects of the diocesan life. One member suggested a diocesan festival, and so began, on the last Sunday in June, 1960 the Eucharistic Festival with a glorious procession, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and a hot-dog party after the service. The Eucharist Festival continues to this day. When Bishop Brady came to the Diocese, most of the congregation used Morning Prayer on Sunday mornings. He worked to set the character for priests to know that each day, especially Sunday, was centered in the Holy Eucharist. Bishop Brady also held many gatherings around the diocese with the clergy and lay people to discuss various subjects including vocations, and Christian response in a civil world. These gatherings stimulated thinking, drew people closer together where they learned to respect each other’s ideas. In the early 1960s, a diocesan-wide fundraising campaign was held that raised over $700,000, benefiting many congregations throughout the diocese over the years by gifts and loans. Brady also served for a time as Chaplain-General of the Order of St. Vincent, the National Guild for Acolytes In 1974, Bishop Brady was one of four bishops who filed charges against bishops who participated in a service in which 11 women deacons were intended to be ordained to the priesthood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 29, 1974. While these ordinations were found to be irregular, the Episcopal Church did eventually allow the ordination of women to the priesthood. Retirement After his retirement in 1980, Bishop Brady continued to live in Fond du Lac. He served briefly as interim Rector in 1982 of St. Paul’s, Savannah, Georgia, a congregation he served from 1940-1948. He also served as Superior General of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. In 1988, Brady was the leader of an American contingent of a pilgrimage to both Glastonbury and Walsingham in England. Brady died on December 23, 1996 after a long illness.

On July 29, 2011, the Oh, Brother! team announced the finale on their blog.Oh, Brother! Blog July 29, 2011 Daily syndication ceased on August 7, 2011. Characters and story Bud and his sister Lily live in a middle-class suburban neighborhood. King Features outlined the sibling situations and interactions: :Whether they are playing together in the family room or running amok in the schoolyard, Bud and Lily elevate the act of one-upmanship to Code Red levels. Lily is the quintessential slightly older yet far more sensible sister. She takes it upon herself to look after her uninhibited, prank-loving younger brother, Bud. While Lily wins the occasional battle with her cool-headed maturity, Bud is intent on winning the war with his brazen brand of mischief. Despite their obvious personality differences, Bud and Lily love each other deeply and have a strong sibling bond. Creative team Bob Weber Jr. is the creator of the award-winning Slylock Fox & Comics For Kids, distributed by King Features to nearly 400 newspapers worldwide. Canadian cartoonist Jay Stephens, a regular contributor to Nickelodeon Magazine, was nominated in 2007 for a National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award for his work on three drawing instruction books. He has been nominated for several Harvey Kurtzman and Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards. Alan Gardner reviewed the strip for The Daily Cartoonist: :The drawing style harkens back to a cartooning style of the ’60s and ’70s. It’s void of extraneous detail (sparse backgrounds, no wrinkles/folds in clothing) which adds to the simplistic writing of the comic. There are no belabored setups to get to the punchline... Another mark of its simplicity is the feature tries to be timeless. There are no iPods, iPads, iMacs or any “iModern conveniences.” In a couple of dailies there is an ATM and an airport X-ray machine that were necessary to set a context, but overall modern references don’t exist. When Bud writes a thank you note to his grandma for a gift, he’s shown handwriting it, not sending an email. I find it interesting that they use a vertical gag panel to do a multi-panel strip. Because of the simplicity of the line art they can pull it off. Sometimes the panel is split in half horizontally, sometimes vertically, sometimes horizontally with the top half is then split vertically. It’s an interesting arrangement, but it works well and it’s not difficult to follow the flow regardless of how they’re laid out.The Daily Cartoonist, June 28, 2010.  Books  \\"Oh, Brother!

With one of the broadest footprints of clean energy projects, spanning nine countries, the company has installed more than 17,000 solar systems and has the largest portfolio of solar rooftops in the GCC. The company has over 175 MW of solar power plants under operation and a further 500 MW under construction. Enviromena was founded in 2007 by Sami Khoreibi, Sander Trestain and Erik Voldner. In 2018 Cabell Fisher was appointed as CEO and is supported by Stuart Bannerman as CFO, Matthew Wells as CLO and David McLeod as CAO. In the first half of 2018, the company had already broken ground on more than 500 megawatts (MW) of solar power in three countries: Egypt, Jordan and the UAE. The scale of the projects in Egypt and Jordan will help provide power to 690,000 homes. Major Projects The Masdar 10MW Solar Power Plant is the largest grid connected photovoltaic solar plant in the Middle East and North Africa and was the first project to be designed and installed by Enviromena Power Systems. The project was commissioned in June 2009 and was the first utility scale solar plant to be connected to the Abu Dhabi Municipal Grid, which is run by the Abu Dhabi Distribution Company. Enviromena also holds the operations and maintenance contract for this project. In 2013, Enviromena completed a Masdar-financed 15MWp PV power plant in Mauritania, which, at the time of its inauguration, was Africa's largest photovoltaic power plant. The $32M project, which is the first utility-scale installation in the country, will provide up to ten percent of Mauritania's power, and offset approximately 22,880 tons of carbon emissions per year. The 11MWp Masdar PV Solar Power Plant in Gotha, Germany incorporates innovative driven-post and screw-post solar racking solutions. The 288,000 square meter PV plant became operational in 2012 and produces approximately 11,000 MWh of energy per year. The plant is connected to the local municipal grid, and offsets approximately 15,750 tons of carbon emissions yearly. The PV/Diesel Hybrid System is the UAE's first solar-diesel hybrid not requiring batteries. It provides round-the-clock electricity to a remote, off-grid residential complex in Abu Dhabi. This system provides 24-hour power solution, with a 2.4MW set of diesel generators, and a 755kWp solar PV system. A microgrid interconnects the two power sources and delivers power to end users. Because of its proximity to the sea, Enviromena's team of engineers designed a unique corrosion-resistant racking system using glass reinforced plastics instead of metal. The Al Jarnain hybrid plant produces 1,336MWh per year, and reduces the island's fuel demand by up to 50 percent. Most recently, Enviromena developed an innovative solar-diesel hybrid power plant in the island of Al Yassat for the Dubai Electricity and Water Agency (DEWA). The project interconnects the private island's current gen-sets with an 800 kWp PV system. Enviromena designed plant components with materials that can withstand the remote island's harsh, high salinity environment and ensure a 25-year life span. Enviromena customized a micro-grid control system to monitor instantaneous load demand and control the diesel generator operation based on the available solar PV power. Other projects completed by Enviromena include a building integrated photovoltaic rooftop installation on Shams Tower at Yas Marina Circuit and a dual purpose solar car park shade structure at Masdar City. Enviromena has the largest installed capacity of grid connected solar photovoltaic projects in the Middle East and North Africa with over 43 MWp across 36 projects in six countries, and an additional 28MWp currently under construction in Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. The company, along with partner TSK of Spain, constructed Jordan's largest solar plant to date, located in Quweira. The 103 MW solar power plant was officially inaugurated on April 28, 2018. Under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Jordan's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, 50/50 joint venture partners Enviromena and TSK completed the construction in 18 months. The Quweira solar power plant was financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, totaling AED550 million. Investors Enviromena has attracted a broad base of clean-tech venture capital investors such as Good Energies, zouk Ventures, New Energies Invest, Moez Kassam, and most recently the Masdar Cleantech Fund.[13] The company completed a series B round of fundraising in January 2010 wherein Masdar became the company's largest shareholder.

Career Napier was born in Dunblane and raised in West Linton, which was then in Peeblesshire. He was a nephew of Celtic player Tommy McInally. He played youth football with Linton Hotspur before joining Blackpool's ground staff straight from school and turning professional in 1960. He played twice in the Football League before joining their arch-rivals, Preston North End, for the 1963–64 season. After a single appearance in the Second Division, and still only 20 years old, he moved on to his third club, Workington, newly promoted to the Third Division. He scored twice as Workington eliminated First Division Blackburn Rovers from the 1964–65 League Cup by five goals to one, and scored the equaliser as his club earned a deserved replay against eventual winners Chelsea in the quarter-final. Such results, added to 25 goals from 58 League matches, attracted attention. In November 1965, First Division club Newcastle United paid £18,000 for Napier's services, but at the end of the season, having struggled to adapt to the higher level, he returned to Division Three with Brighton & Hove Albion, for an £8,500 fee. At Brighton he finally found some stability; of the six seasons he spent with the club, he was their top scorer in all but 1969–70,Carder & Harris, Albion A–Z, p. 338. and helped them to runners-up spot in 1972. Though his club were promoted, Napier spent two further seasons in Division Three, with Blackburn Rovers.

The station is on the Gotthard railway and is also the terminus of the Lugano Città–Stazione funicular. The metre gauge Lugano–Ponte Tresa Railway (FLP) has a separate station at Lugano FLP railway station across the station forecourt from the main line station. The station is situated on a hillside to the west of the city centre, overlooking the city and Lake Lugano, and the funicular provides a direct link from the station to the city centre below. The residential quarter of Besso lies above and to the west of the station. The station is nicknamed Terrazza del Ticino (\\"Terrace of Ticino\\") since the opening of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in 2016.  History  The Gotthard railway's station was opened in 1874, as part of that railway's Lugano to Chiasso line. By 1882, with the opening of the line across the Monte Ceneri Pass to Bellinzona, and the Gotthard Rail Tunnel beyond that, Lugano was connected with the rest of the canton of Ticino and with northern Switzerland. The Lugano Città–Stazione funicular opened in 1886, and was followed by the Lugano–Tesserete railway (LT) in 1909, and the Lugano–Ponte Tresa railway (FLP) in 1912. The LT operated from a terminus and depot to the north-east of the main station, whilst the FLP constructed a terminus at a lower level to the south-east of the main station. Additionally, in 1910, a branch of the city's urban tramway was extended to the station forecourt. Until 1927 the station formed a barrier between the city to one side, and the suburb of Besso to the other. However, in that year a road tunnel and pedestrian subway were constructed under the railway, which allowed the extension of the city's trams to Besso. In 1943, Piazzale di Besso was created to the west of the station. The Lugano tramway closed in the 1950s. The Lugano–Tesserete railway closed in 1967, and the site of its station is now occupied by the regional bus stop and turning circle at the northern end of the station forecourt. The first section of its trackbed now forms a pedestrian ramp down to Via S. Gottardo, and the site of its depot is a car park. In 1998 a project was initiated to improve the railway station facilities and the surrounding areas, designed by the architect Aurelio Galfetti. This has included the redevelopment of the forecourt of the station, especially in terms of pedestrian safety. In 2007 the station underpass was restored, and a third (northern) platform was constructed, which allows access to the station from the north.  Facilities  The station is owned and operated by the Swiss Federal Railways. It contains four tracks, arranged with flanking side platforms and a central island platform. The main station buildings are on the platform on the city centre side of the station, but there is also access from the Besso side of the station to the adjacent platform. Both of these platforms, and the island platform between them, are linked by two pedestrian underpasses. In front of the station is a large forecourt, from which traffic other than buses and taxis is excluded. Local buses of the Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL) operate from the southern end of the forecourt, whilst regional buses of the AutoPostale and Autolinee Regionali Luganesi operate from the northern end. The station to city funicular, also operated by TPL, runs from a platform directly adjacent to the main station building, descending in tunnel under the forecourt. The station does not include any freight handling facilities. Freight in the Lugano area is handled through the Lugano Vedeggio freight yard, constructed in the 1970s and accessed via a branch from the Gotthard railway near Taverne-Torricella station. Services Located near the southern end of the Gotthard railway, Lugano is served by long distance trains from northern Switzerland, principally Zurich and Basel, including EuroCity trains to Milan in Italy. It is also served by local trains of the Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia (TILO). The following services stop at Lugano: * EuroCity/RegioExpress: hourly or better service to . * EuroCity/InterCity: hourly service to Zürich Hauptbahnhof. * EuroCity/InterCity: service every two hours to . * RegioExpress: hourly service most of the day to , with most trains continuing from Bellinzona to . * /: half-hourly service between Bellinzona and ; hourly service from Mendrisio to , , or . The Lugano Città–Stazione funicular, one of Switzerland's busiest funicular lines, runs continuously from 05:20 to 23:50, seven days a week. Selected city bus routes of the Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL), and some regional routes of the AutoPostale and Autolinee Regionali Luganesi (ARL), serve the station. However the main hubs of Lugano's bus network are elsewhere, with TPL and ARL serving a city centre bus station a few minutes walk from the lower terminus of the funicular, and AutoPostale using an underground bus station to the north of the city centre.

The attack was initiated several times in September and October that year but unreliable ships and unfavourable weather caused the plan to be aborted on each occasion.  Inception  Following the fall of France in July 1940, the Germans threatened to invade Britain. The British Government made strenuous efforts to meet the invasion and also sought to attack the Germans before any landings took place. As invasion barges were seen to gather in French ports along the English Channel, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was sent to attack them by bombing. Experiments by the Petroleum Warfare Department (PWD) aimed to burn the invasion barges before they could reach the English shore. The first idea was simply to explode a vessel filled with oil and this was tried at Maplin Sands where a Thames oil tanker, Suffolk, with of petroleum was blown up in shallow water. Another idea was that oil should be held in place on the water by a trough formed from coir matting. A machine formed the trough from a flat mat as it was paid out over the stern of a ship. Trials with the Ben Hann produced a flaming ribbon × that could be towed at . Neither idea proved workable. Suffolk provided a trial for a more ambitious scheme to burn invasion barges before they left port. The plan was first floated in early June–July 1940 and became known as Operation Lucid.Piece reference PREM 3/264—LUCID operation (fireships)., The Catalogue, The National ArchivesPiece reference WO 193/734—Use of oil for defensive and offensive purposes, The Catalogue, The National Archives Lucid had the backing of Churchill. The idea of using fire ships against Hitler's invasion as the English had attacked the Spanish Armada in 1588 appealed to Churchill's sense of history. Recalling a pre-emptive attack by Sir Francis Drake, Churchill said that just as Drake had \\"singed the King of Spain's beard\\", he wanted to \\"singe Mr Hitler's moustache\\".  Preparation  Captain Augustus Agar an officer of the Royal Navy, who had been awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) in 1918 was chosen to lead the operation. Agar chose Morgan Morgan-Giles as his staff officer because of his experience with setting explosive charges. Oil tankers were required for the operation but these were in short supply. Only the \\"oldest crocks laid up in our rivers and creeks which had not been to sea for years and were useless except for scrap metal\\" could be spared. Workers were put to the task of coaxing three of these old crocks back into service. Time was of the essence and Agar regretted that for the sake of secrecy he could not tell the workmen what the ships were for, he was certain that they would have worked more enthusiastically had they known the truth. A rumour was put about that they were to be used as blockships. Another problem with secrecy was the difficulty in acquiring reliable motor-boats on which the crew would escape; there was an unwillingness to release good boats to equip ancient oilers and there was a last minute panic to get speed-boats. Oakfield (the former War Africain), and Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ships and , having been laid up for years, were now coaxed back into service but they were slow – less than six knots – and unreliable. The Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company had built War Nizam in 1918 and War Nawab in 1919. Both ships were long and abeam with a draft of and a gross register tonnage of about 5,600. Oakfield had been built in 1918 with a grt of 5,218, long and abeam. The ships were quickly made ready and each filled with Agar’s Special Mixture a cocktail of 50 per cent heavy fuel oil, 25 per cent diesel oil and 25 per cent petrol developed by the PWD.. The leaky bulkheads caused the engine rooms of War Nawab to fill with fumes that caused men to pass out and later resulted in the harbourmaster concluding that the crew were drunk. To this lethal load, bundles of cordite, gun cotton and old depth charges were added to give the ships more punch. The idea was to sail at night until the fire ships were near the entrances of the target ports. All but two or three of the crew would be taken off, detonation timers would be set and each ship put to its final heading towards a harbour mouth. The remaining crew would escape in a motor boat at the last minute. When the explosives detonated, the fire ship's hold would rupture and with a ship in, or as close as possible to, the harbour mouth, a slick of burning fuel would be drawn into the harbour by the rising tide. Chief Petty Officer Ronald Apps recalled,  Execution and cancellation  Late in the afternoon of 26 September 1940, War Nizam and Oakfield set sail from Sheerness and headed towards Calais and War Nawab set sail from Portsmouth to Boulogne. A diversionary bombardment by the RAF was also ordered against Ostend. A number of destroyers, motor torpedo boats and other vessels escorted the fireships. Agar commanded the operation from the destroyer . An unfavourable wind blew up and Oakfield soon dropped out; a little later War Nizam suffered boiler problems, leaving only War Nawab to continue. Unwilling to sacrifice the element of surprise and under orders from Churchill not to hesitate to call things off if the plan did not go well, Agar cancelled the operation. The recall reached Nawab from Boulogne. Another attempt was made on 3 October, this was thwarted by bad weather, as was an attempt for the following night. On the night of 7/8 October, an acoustic mine damaged an escorting destroyer with Agar on board; the convoy scattered and the destroyer limped home. Plans were made for another attempt in early November but by then Hitler had postponed Operation Sealion and the Admiralty correspondingly postponed Operation Lucid. The plan was revived in the spring of 1941 but never put into action. War Nawab continued in service as an oil hulk until being broken up in 1958. In 1962, her ship's bell was remounted on the quarterdeck of the Royal New Zealand Navy's Sea Cadet unit based at Wanganui on New Zealand's North island.

The term \\"durians\\" refers to the very offensive smelling fruit of a plant On most public transport systems, there are at least some activities passengers are prohibited to engage in. Activities like these, which can be restricted in vehicles, stations, and other property of the agency, are prohibited for a variety of reasons. These include keeping other passengers safe and comfortable, protecting the operator, or protecting the vehicles and stations. Penalties for violations can vary. They can include fines, arrest, prosecution, or removal from the service. Eating and drinking Many local public transport services, such as municipal bus or rapid transit systems (two notable exceptions being the Beijing Subway and the New York City Subway), prohibit passengers from consuming food or beverages or carrying open food or beverage containers while on board a vehicle or in a station. Generally, services providing longer forms of transportation, such as regional rail or intercity buses, will allow at least some eating and drinking. But some services, like Megabus, prohibit eating and drinking. In emergency cases these prohibitions may be waived. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has a strict ban on consumption of food or drink in the paid area of train stations, on trains or buses, or on elevators or escalators used to enter or exit stations, in order to reduce attractiveness to insects and vermin. Fines of $100 can be imposed, except the Authority has lifted the ban with respect to consumption of water during heat emergencies. A survey of SEPTA riders found that 48% of riders eat while on board their services either regularly or some of the time.http://www.septa.org/cs/survey/results/013.html Smoking Smoking is one of the most common prohibitions on board a public transport vehicle. Since second-hand smoke can be hazardous to one's health, smoking is prohibited in most public places worldwide, including public transport. Note that as of 2016, the prohibition on smoking only applies to cigarettes which burn something that generates smoke (e.g. tobacco or marijuana), although some localities want to ban public smoking of electronic cigarettes. In 1975, a federal law was passed in the United States banning smoking in all public transport vehicles.Smoking and the workplace By Roger Blanpain, Gordon Anderson, page 144 Some intercity bus services will stop to offer smoke breaks to riders. Audio devices Most systems prohibit the use of audio-producing devices, such as radios, CD players, MP3 players, musical instruments, or other similar gadgets without an earphone through which only the listener can hear. Mobile phones Some public transport systems prohibit or limit the use of mobile phones while on board. Some rail systems have \\"quiet cars\\" where passengers are not permitted to engage in conversations and where cell phones cannot be used. Photography In some places, it is unlawful to photograph or film a public transport vehicle or station or the operation of a public transportation service. Anti-photography laws (or rules) are in place for various reasons, including the privacy of passengers and crew and concerns over terrorism. However, these measures have caused problems for enthusiasts whose hobby is to ride and photograph transport. In some cities, the rules have been abandoned or modified. In other places, the authorities regard enthusiasts as their supporters and encourage their activities so long as they are carried out in a lawful manner from places open to the general public. In the United States, it is generally legal to take photographs in public, and absent special and extraordinary conditions, a law prohibiting photography in public areas of a transit vehicle or area operated by a transit authority, or a transit authority prohibition on photography under such conditions likely would not withstand judicial scrutiny, and the courts probably would not uphold such bans. Solicitation Many systems have anti-solicitation laws or guidelines. These include prohibitions against: *Selling, advertising the sale of, or purchasing goods or services *Campaigning or handing out literature for a political candidate, cause, or religion *Soliciting signatures, sometimes including those opposing cutbacks or changes in service *Begging (panhandling) *Prostitution and other obscene and immoral acts (which are sometimes illegal even outside of the transport network) Space considerations Some services have guidelines regarding the amount of space a passenger can take up whether with one's body or belongings. In some transit systems, including the New York City Subway, it is unlawful to place one's belongings on another seat, even when vacant; however, in the New York City Subway, this rule is frequently flouted. Privately run intercity bus services usually have limits for carry-on and checked luggage, similar to the baggage allowance system on airplanes. Some transit systems have a seating precedence rule for passengers who pay adult fare against discounted passengers, i.e. discounted and free-pass holders may not sit unless all adults paying full-fare sit. However, this is generally considered to be discriminatory as most discounted and free tickets are issued to the elderly and disabled as well as children Criminal acts While any crime committed on a public transport system would generally be treated like one committed elsewhere, there are some acts for which the prohibitions are emphasized in guidelines on posted signs. =Disorderly conduct= *Use of roller skates, roller blades, skateboards, scooters, or similar vehicles on transit property (many operators have bicycle racks on the front of buses, and will permit bicycles which are walked to be used on vehicles not having separate facilities such as subway trains.) *Drunken or other similar behavior *Use of profanity. In the United States, this is controversial due to First Amendment protections. However a private operator has the right to establish rules on their property as they see fit. =Vagrancy= *Sleeping. This refers not to accidental dozing, but to the intentional use of the system as a place to sleep. *Loitering at a bus stop or rail station longer than is necessary to catch the bus or train, or spending time there at all if not using the service. *Riding a bus or train through multiple runs of the service, even with an unlimited travel pass for the period of time for which the act is occurring. =Other= *Vandalism (including graffiti or destruction of property) *Littering *Expectoration (spitting) Prohibited items =Firearms= Generally, firearms, in countries where they are otherwise allowed to be carried by civilians, are not permitted on board public transport vehicles. Exceptions can be made for law enforcement or military personnel or others with a carrying permit. =Explosives and flammables= Many systems prohibit explosives and flammable liquids that pose threat to the safety of others. =Animals= Many places prohibit live animals from being brought on board public transport vehicles. Exceptions are sometimes made for animals kept within a container from which they cannot escape or service animals for those with disabilities. =Bicycles= On most rail systems, bicycles are allowed, but may be restricted. On buses, there are more such limitations. Many buses now have external bike racks where riders can attach their bikes. Sometimes, bikes are only allowed on buses if there is enough free space.

She was executed at the age of 17 for shooting at German troops. As her captors tied the noose around her neck, they offered her a way out of the gallows by revealing her comrades' and leaders' identities. She responded that she was not a traitor and that her comrades would reveal themselves when they avenged her death. Early life Radić was born to a Bosnian Serb family on 19 December 1925 in the village of Gašnica near Bosanska Gradiška. After graduation from the elementary school in the nearby Bistrica, she attended the first grade of Women's School of Crafts in Bosanska Krupa and completed the remaining grades at school in Bosanska Gradiška. As a pupil, Lepa emphasized hard work, seriousness, and was also interested in reading advanced literature. She developed her core positions under the strong influence of her uncle Vladeta Radić, who was involved in the labor movement. Starting with becoming a member of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ), she eventually joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1941 at the age of 15. World War II On 10 April 1941, after the invasion of Yugoslavia, the Axis powers established the Independent State of Croatia, which included Bosanska Gradiška and surrounding areas. In November 1941, Lepa Radić and other family members were arrested by the Ustaše, but with the help of undercover partisan associates, Lepa and her sister Dara managed to escape from prison on 23 December 1941. Following her escape, she joined the 7th partisan company of the 2nd Krajiški Detachment. In February 1943 Lepa Radić was responsible for transporting the wounded in the battle of Neretva to a shelter in Grmeč. During the fight against the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen she was captured and moved to Bosanska Krupa where, after torture for several days in an attempt to extract information, she was sentenced to death by hanging. With the noose around her neck, she cried out: \\"Long live the Communist Party, and partisans! Fight, people, for your freedom! Do not surrender to the evildoers! I will be killed, but there are those who will avenge me!\\" In her last moments at the scaffold, the Germans offered to spare her life, in return for the names of the Communist Party leaders and members in the shelter, but she refused their offer with the words: \\"I am not a traitor of my people. Those whom you are asking about will reveal themselves when they have succeeded in wiping out all you evildoers, to the last man.\\" Lepa Radić was only 17 years old when she was publicly executed.

Roger was also Sheriff of Berkshire from 1186 until the death of King Henry II in 1189. After the death of King Henry, Roger's brother Walter was put in charge of England while Henry's son Richard I was away on Crusade from 1191 to 1193. Roger profited from his brother's rise to power by receiving custody of Wallingford Castle, the Tower of London, and Bristol Castle. Roger granted land to Launceston Priory for his and his wife's souls. He also held land at Ramsden Bellhouse, half a knight's fee, which he was granted by Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London.

It probably dates to the 7th century AD. Location The exact location at which the stone was found is unknown, but thought to be in a field in the East Mains of Dunnichen, on the SE slope of Dunnichen Hill, (), overlooking Dunnichen Moss. It is currently on display at the Meffan Institute in Forfar (). History Jervise relates that the stone was found in a field called the Chashel or Castle Park, and that the site later became a quarry. While this name is no longer extant, Headrick records that it was in East Mains of Dunnichen, and the location was later assigned in 1966 at a disused quarry on that farm. The discovery was described by Headrick: > ... a good many years ago, there was turned up with the plough a large flat > stone, on which is cut a rude outline of an armed warrior's head and > shoulders Jervise, noting the inaccuracy of description, identifies this confidently with the extant Dunnichen Stone. The stone was initially erected at the unidentified \\"Kirkton Church\\", either in Dunnichen or in Letham, then it was moved to the garden of Dunnichen House.

Biography James Anderson served through the American War of Independence as a midshipman, and after the end of the war, joined the colonial service in the West Indies. He married Jane Anne Thornhill in September 1790, and rejoined the navy in 1793 with the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and was made lieutenant. He was promoted to commander in 1806, and spent some years as agent of transports, after which he commanded the brig-sloop , operating in the English Channel against privateers. He became the senior officer on the coast between Calais and Boulogne in 1811, until being promoted to post-captain in 1812. In August 1814 Anderson was appointed to the 74-gun , and sent out with stores to Quebec, where he was ordered to dismantle the rigging and remove her guns, sending them on to the forces on the Great Lakes. He was then to winter at Quebec. The ship was old and rotten, badly manned, and inadequately equipped; and Captain Anderson, judging that it was impossible to stay at Quebec without sacrificing the ship, returned to England; on the charge of this action being contrary to his orders, he was tried by court martial. Lord Melville, then First Lord of the Admiralty, criticised Anderson's decision, telling him that \\"If Canada fall, it will be entirely owing to your not wintering the Zealous at Quebec\\"; to which Anderson replied: \\"I rather think it will be in consequence of proper supplies, in proper ships, not having been sent out there at a proper season of the year\\". Naval historian John Knox Laughton read into Melville's response the intention to sacrifice Zealous in order to provide an excuse should British forces in Canada suffer a defeat, and was not pleased with Anderson's thwarting his plan. Anderson was acquitted of the charges at the court martial, but due to the drawdown of the navy in 1815 after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he did not serve again at sea. Works Anderson engaged in various scientific and literary pursuits, and was said to have contributed several articles to magazines, though the only one he signed was \\"Some Observations on the Peculiarity of the Tides between Fairleigh and Dungeness\\", which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1819. He died on 30 December 1835.

This division is responsible for creating informative resources(including standards, frameworks, tools, and technologies) that strengthen communications interoperability, improve Internet security, and integrity and accelerate the development of automated capabilities to help identify potential threats to the U.S. The division took over most of the functions envisioned by the U.S. Congress for the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC), which was under the Cybersecurity and Communications unit created by the Homeland Security Appropriations Act (2007). These included the coordination of emergency communications planning, preparedness, and response. This particular area serves as the basis for the division's involvement in developing protocols for emergency responders. Customers include local, tribal, state, federal, international, and private emergency response agencies; agencies that plan for, detect, and respond to hazards; and private-sector partners that own, operate, and maintain the nation's cyber infrastructure. Five program areas The CCID is managed by the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology. This division works to accomplish its mission of creating and deploying information resources to enable seamless and secure interactions among homeland security stakeholders. It is also the primary research and development organization of the DHS and is headed by the Under Secretary for Science and Technology. In 2010, this directorate requested for $968 million, which included the proposed $15 million increase to the $74.9 million funding the Command, Control, and Interoperability Division was allocated in 2009. The CCID is organized through five program areas: Basic/Futures Research; Cyber Security; Knowledge Management Tools; Office for Interoperability and Compatibility; and Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Investigative Technologies. =Basic/Futures Research= The Basic/Futures Research program area is led by Dr. Joseph Kielman. The program was put in place to conduct long-term, fundamental research in support of CCID. It also strives to advance technologies that can serve the department and the local, tribal, state, federal, and international partners. This program area also develops and fosters a research community to identify and demonstrate novel information discovery, analysis, and management concepts and capabilities. This enables the division to identify, assess, minimize or prevent the impact of terrorist attacks and natural or man made disasters. Within the Basic/Futures Research Program are actually two programs. The first is known as the Visual Analytics and Precision Information Environments Program; he second includes the Discrete-Element Computing, Privacy, and Forensics Program. The Visual Analytics and Precision Information Environments Program uses visually based mathematical methods and computational algorithms to discover, manipulate, or comprehend diverse data. The program also conducts research on novel advanced technologies and techniques for understanding and manipulating information in multiple forms or modes. These techniques tend to include text, video, images, audio, databases, and sensor data. The knowledge found through this program helps to anticipate terrorist incidents and/or catastrophic events. The Discrete-Element Computing, Privacy, and Forensics Program consists of software algorithms and hardware architectures that access, process and manage multiple types and modes of information. This program assesses threats and consequences, ensuring information privacy and securing the cyber infrastructure while protecting telecommunications interoperability.http://www.cyber.st.dhs.gov/public/CATCH/Boyd.pdf The Discrete-Element Computing, Privacy, and Forensics Program provides real-time data analysis and decision support against potential threats and imminent disasters. =Cyber security= The CCID Cyber Security Program Area is run by Dr. Douglas Maughan. The program specializes in cyber-security research, development, testing, and evaluation in order to decrease the amount of economic and national security threats on our nation. This will help secure the nation's current and future critical cyber infrastructure in support of the Department of Homeland Security operational missions and the priorities established in the president's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Cyber Security has three program areas within the overall program: Information Infrastructure Security (IIS), Cyber Security Research Tools and Techniques (RTT), and Next Generation Technologies (NGT.) There were also separate activities and programs within the Cyber Security program area. These consist of Defense Technology Experimental Research (DETER)Testbed: Department of Homeland Security Secure Wireless Access Prototype (DSWAP: Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Project: IronKey: Linking the Oil and Gas Industry to Improve Cyber Security (LOGIIC): Project 25 Compliance Assessment Program (P25 CAP): Protected Repository for the Defense of Infrastructure against Cyber Threats (PREDICT.) = Knowledge Management Tools= The Knowledge Management Tools program area of Command, Control, and Interoperability is led by Dr. John Hoyt and provides knowledge management capabilities to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks, prepare for natural and man-made disasters, and provide an effective response to these disasters. Knowledge Management Tools also develops new tools, devices, and methods to process and analyze massive amounts of information that are widely dispersed and are found in multiple forms. = Office for Interoperability and Compatibility = The CCID Office for Interoperability and Compatibility is led by Karen Ray. This program area works with emergency response communities and federal partners to improve local, tribal, state, and federal emergency preparedness and response. It also strengthens interoperable wireless communications and improves effective information sharing by developing tools and technologies, to enhance overall planning and coordination at all levels of government through both voice and data. A mission of the Office for Interoperability and Compatibility is to help emergency responders manage incidents and exchange information in real time. =Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Investigative Technologies= This program area is led and run by John Price. This area researches develops technologies that aid in the discovery, investigation, and the prosecution of terrorists and criminals. There are also separate programs and activities within the CID Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Investigative Technologies Program Area. One is the Digital Ink Library Project. This project is led by Shane Cullen and was successfully transitioned to the United States Secret Service (USSS) in January 2009. The CID worked with United States Secret Service (USSS) forensic investigators to enhance mission effectiveness by digitizing the complete archive of ink samples. As a result, ink sample matching takes seconds as opposed to hours or days, and irreplaceable inks remain secure. Another project is the RealEyes Project. RealEyes is a cutting-edge technology that enables personal digital assistant (PDA) devices or cell phones to send real-time video and geo-spatial coordinates, view live video from a fixed or mobile camera, control fixed cameras, and immediately stream video from a PDA.

From there trains cross the Rhine via Mannheim or run south towards Speyer. It was opened in 1853 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. History  Mainz–Worms–Ludwigshafen line in purple The first proposals for building a railway line west of the Rhine between Mainz and Worms, dated back to the 1830s, shortly after the opening of the first German railway line between Nuremberg and Fürth. This line was promoted by the governments of Bavaria (which then included the territory involved) and France. They later dropped the plan for financial and military reasons. Plans for the line did not resume until 1844. A route through Alzey was discarded in favour of a direct alignment along the Rhine (However, this route was later built as well, now forming the Mainz–Alzey railway and the Rheinhessen Railway). In 1845, the Hessian Ludwig Railway Company () received a concession to build and operate this route. In 1848 work on the line started. The first section of the line between Mainz and Worms was opened on 23 March 1853 and it was completed to Ludwigshafen on 15 November 1853. The line was integrated in the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn as line S6 on 10 June 2018 from Mainz to Mannheim. This forms part of a planned through line via Heidelberg to the Elsenz Valley Railway or the Schwarzbach Valley Railway. In addition to the modernisation of existing stations, this involved two new stations in Dienheim and Frankenthal-Süd. Operations  Intercity-Express train in Guntersblum station Class 425 electric multiple units in Worms Hauptbahnhof Frankenthal Central Station The double-track, electrified line is still of great importance for regional and long-distance traffic. A number of long- distance Intercity or Intercity-Express trains run from Koblenz or Wiesbaden on the Mainz-Mannheim line. In addition, there is a dense network of regional trains: in addition to the half-hourly Regionalbahn service on the line, there is a Regional-Express service via Speyer to Karlsruhe. Increased regular interval services in the 1990s led to an increase in ridership. Until 2004, regional services were provided by locomotive-hauled trains.

Walker House and Farm is a historic farmstead in the far western part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Located southwest of the village of New Madison along State Route 121, it is composed of five buildings and one other structure spread out over an area of nearly . Christopher Walker During the late nineteenth century, Christopher Walker was one of Darke County's leading farmers.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 309. Born in Baltimore County, Maryland in 1829, he moved to Darke County with his parents, who first settled in Butler Township. Beginning in 1851 and continuing through most of the rest of the decade, he participated in owning and running a local store in Braffettsville, which position he occupied through most of the rest of the decade; during this time, he married the former Mary Brawley. By 1858, Walker had become dissatisfied with storekeeping; he sold his interest in the store and began farming, purchasing the farm in Harrison Township near New Madison in 1862.The History of Darke County, Ohio: Containing A History of the County; Its Cities, Towns, etc.; General and Local Statistics; Portraits of Early Settlers and Prominent Men; History of the Northwest Territory; History of Ohio; Map of Darke County; Constitution of the United States, Miscellaneous Matters, etc., etc. Chicago: Beers, 1880, 704/705. From his earliest years as an independent farmer, Walker was primarily a raiser of livestock: from 1862 to 1866, he was engaged with his brothers in distributing hogs, and after that business venture failed, he began to concentrate on producing his own livestock. By 1880, he had expanded his farm to approximately , divided between in northern Preble County to the south, elsewhere in Harrison Township, and surrounding his farmhouse. Recognition Two of the farm's buildings have been widely recognized: the 1879 barn and the 1884 house. Measuring by , the barn was designed with an \\"L\\" shape to make stock raising more effective; one writer deemed it the best barn he had ever seen. Likewise, the farmhouse was built for the convenience of its residents: mixing the Victorian, Second Empire, and Italianate styles of architecture, it is dominated by a tower with a Mansard roof, and it sits atop a small hill overlooking State Route 121 to the north. The Walker farm remains a local landmark to the present day, evoking a strong contrast between its ornate nineteenth-century architecture and the plain modern architecture of the farms around it. In 1982, the farm complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, both because of its well-preserved historic architecture and because of its contribution to local history. Key to its importance in local history is Walker's contribution to Darke County agriculture, as the farm buildings were a leading element of his livestock programs that made the county one of Ohio's foremost in hog raising.

(28 May 1886 in Kroměříž – 29 December 1968 in Prague) was a prominent Czech orientalist, translator, professor of Iranology and Turkology at Charles University, Prague. The memorial plaque on his native house in Kromeriz Jan Rypka was a participant in Ferdowsi Millenary Celebration in Tehran in 1934.Naše řeč no. 1, vol. 32 (1948) (Czech) Early life Rypka's father owned a small business. As a child he was given the Arabian Nights. He described the book's effect on his life as breathing \\"mysterious forces there.\\" After completing his schooling he enrolled at the University of Vienna.www.libri.cz (Czech) He graduated in Oriental studies. Then in 1910 he obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in Islamic languages. (Czech) After graduation Rypka set up a small business of translating Oriental texts. However, he soon left the business because he found a better job, even if not so closely related to his orientalist background, as he was appointed at the Viennese court and university printing office. Rypka moved to Prague following the establishment of the independent Czechoslovak state. There he devoted himself fully to Oriental studies. He also joined the civil service for a short time. In April 1921, he found work as a librarian. That same summer, he was granted a sabbatical leave to travel to Constantinople. Rypka stayed in Constantinople for nearly a year and a half. In that ancient city he found ample opportunities to know and understand the Orient close up, an experience he put in the book he wrote about his stay in Turkey. Return From Constantinople Rypka once again began work at the Ministry of Education after returning from Constantinople. He began working on Turkish poetry, analyzing the works of such poets as Sabit and Bâkî. Beginning in the 1930s, Rypka moved his focus to Persian poetry. The central figure in his research was the Persian poet Nizami. Another of his key subjects was the medieval poet Ferdowsi. In the fall of 1934 Rypka was invited by the Iranian government to attend the celebrations of the 1000th anniversary of Ferdous' birth. He ended up spending a full year in Iran, doing academic research. He wrote about his year in Iran in the popular book Iranian Pilgrim. The Oriental Institute Rypka was the driving force behind the establishment of the Oriental Institute, of which he was one of the earliest members.www.orient.cas.cz (Czech) He contributed to the institute's development, contributing not only as a journalist but as an adviser and patron in its incipient stages. He is even credited with naming the institute's archives, the Archive Oriental. Works In 1939 Rypka was appointed dean of the Faculty of Arts of the Charles University in Prague. During his tenure, he focused the research on Persian poets, notably Labbibi and Farrochi. His biggest achievement was the work on the history of Persian and Tajik literature, which was published in 1956. The work won critical acclaim from fellow professionals and was translated into many languages.
