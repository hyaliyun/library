In this book, Dewey compares Reiner‚Äôs process to the ‚Äúold monk poet Basho, who, it was said, would go into the mountains to pay tribute to specific trees,‚Äù though of course Reiner typically approaches trees via car.Fred Dewey. ‚ÄúIf We are Lucky.‚Äù Los Angeles Trees, 2001-2008. Munich. Prestel. 2008. \\"Cut for instrumental reasons according to non-arboreal, non-natural intent, the trees nonetheless retain their nature, responding to heat, light, and soil, but most of all the ferocious Department of Transportation.\\"Fred Dewey. Trees and Words. Venice. Beyond Baroque. 2004. \\"The result is quiet, calling for contemplation, and, in a final move, hints at the story and mystery behind the shape.\\" Work =Color Field Paintings= \\"Beginning with minimalist canvases, Reiner moved into painting signs and word fragments in the urban landscape, influenced by the work of LA artists Ruscha, Diebenkorn, Celmins...\\" Although Reiner's abstract paintings have also been compared to those by Mark Rothko and Cy Twombly, critics have been quick to note that his ‚Äúcolor field‚Äù paintings capably distill quotidian experiences into particular palettes. Toby Crockett observed how \\"Reiner's controlled approach creates a template by which the world can be reduced to its juicy details [and] is filled with genuine feeling.\\"Toby Crockett. \\"Lucas Reiner at Bennett Roberts.Art in America. May 1996. =City Tree Paintings= After spending time in the Michigan forests in 2001, Reiner started to focus on the trees in his Los Angeles environment. Responding to the way urban trees are routinely brutalized by trucks, sidewalks, and neglectful passersby, Reiner started creating little tree portraits. Fred Dewey wonders why it took contemporary artists so long to address suffering city trees, since Frederick Law Olmsted noticed the savage cutting of trees around 1870. Eve Wood noted that \\"these dense little paintings are more than quaint depictions of [city] trees, but encapsulate both their stature and movement, as well as a kind of ineffable presence.\\"Eve Wood. \\"Implied Narratives.\\" Artnet. January 27, 2003. From observing Reiner's tree paintings, whose titles reflect their particular locations, Petra Giloy-Hirtz discovers that Los Angeles trees are ‚Äúcrooked, mistreated, strangely trimmed, pruned into shapes by the traffic, grazed by the truck, cut back to cut the view of the billboards, [and even] alienated by signs, Christmas decorations, or graffiti.‚Äù Responding to Reiner's tree paintings, Nicholas Grider observes how ‚Äúspecific individual trees‚Ä¶float against delicately-colored abstract expressionist backgrounds that recall Phillip Guston‚Äôs early work. The tension between specificity and the general nature of the gestural backgrounds deliberately leads the viewer to think not just about trees as portrait subjects, but about what his or her own relationship with trees is in daily life.‚Äù Nicholas Grider. ‚ÄúMinimalism, Theatricality, and You.‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôArtslant.‚Äô‚Äô September 9, 2007. Petra Giloy-Hirtz adds, \\"For in the end the tree is not an unusual theme in the history of art. It is less about the phenomenology of the tree than about the possibilities of painting.\\" Regarding Reiner's relationship to his subject matter, Dewey adds that \\"The links of Reiner's work to those of painter Giorgio Morandi are clear. Morandi did painting after painting of bottles and landscape...pushing a commitment to representation of the world to the limit.\\" *Spirit of '76 (1990) *Gold Cup (2000) *Trees in Los Angeles (2005) Teaching In addition to having taught at Art Division (2011) and at Otis College of Art and Design (2007), Reiner has been a visiting artist at numerous institutions, including the American Academy in Rome, California State University, Northridge, Oberlin College, Myers School of Art, Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa, and Universit√† Iuav di Venezia.

It emerges if interest rates are settled on liabilities for periods which differ from those on offsetting assets. Repricing risk also refers to the probability that the yield curve will move in a way that influence by the values of securities tied to interest rates -- especially, bonds and market securities.[Moffett, M.H., Stonehill, A.I., & Eiteman, D. K. (2016). Fundamentals of Multinational Finance (5th ed.): Pearson Education Limited.] Review on repricing risk Repricing risk is presented by assets and liabilities that reprice at different times and rates. The changes in interest rate either impacts on the asset returns or the liability costs.C. Prabhavath, \\"Impact of interest Rate Risk in Banking System\\", Indian Journal of Applied Research, Vol. 3, no. 3, 2013, p 3 314. Repricing risks arise from timing differences in the maturity for fixed-rate and repricing for floating-rate bank assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions.Gert Wehinger, \\"Risks Ahead for the Financial Industry in a Changing Interest Rate Environment\\", OECD Journal: Financial Market Trends, 2010, p 13. Any instance of an interest rate being reset‚Äîeither due to maturities or floating interest rate resets‚Äîis called a repricing. The date on which it occurs is called the repricing date. One reason may be maturity mismatches. For instance, suppose a company is earning 5% on an asset supporting a liability on which it is paying 3.5%. The asset matures in three years while the liability matures in ten. In three years, the firm will have to reinvest the proceeds from the asset. If interest rates decrease, it could end up reinvesting at 3%. For the remaining seven years, it would earn 3% on the new asset while continuing to pay 3.5% on the original liability. Repricing risk also occurs with floating rate assets or liabilities. If fixed rate assets are financed with floating rate liabilities, the rate payable on the liabilities may rise while the rate earned on the assets remains constant. If a portfolio has assets repricing earlier than liabilities, it is said to be asset sensitive. This is because recent changes in earnings are driven by interest rate resets on those assets. Similarly, if liabilities reprice earlier, earnings are more exposed to interest rate resets on those liability, and the portfolio is called liability sensitive. Repricing price effect Repricing risk reflects the possibility that assets and liabilities will be repriced at different times or amounts and affect an institution‚Äôs earnings, capital, or general financial condition in a negative way. For example, the management may use non-maturity deposits to fund long-term, fixed-rate securities. If deposit rates increase, the higher funding costs would likely reduce net yields on fixed-rate securities.C. Prabhavath, \\"Impact of Interest Rate Risk In Banking System\\", Indian Journal of Applied Research, Vol. 3, no. 3, 2013, p 3 314. The repricing gap is a measure of the difference between the dollar value of assets that will reprice and the dollar value of liabilities that will reprice within a specific time period, where reprice means the potential to receive a new interest rate.Binjia Yang and Gendi Wen, \\"The Empirical Measurement of Interest Rate Risk of China‚Äôs Commercial Banks in the Process of Interest Rate Liberalization\\", International Journal of Financial Research, Vol. 5, No. 3, 2014, p. 189 Rate sensitivity represents the time interval where repricing can occur. Rate-sensitive assets are those assets that will mature or reprice in a given time period. Rate-sensitive liabilities are those liabilities that will mature or reprice in a given time period. The repricing model focuses on the potential changes in the net interest income variable.[The Quarterly Review of Interest Rate Risk, Office of Supervision, Economic Analysis Division, 2003, p. 2-3.] In effect, if interest rates change, interest income and interest expense will change as the various assets and liabilities are repriced, that is, receive new interest rates. There are two advantages of repricing model. First, it is easily to be understood. And it works well with small changes in interest rates. One of its disadvantages is it ignores market value effects and off-balance sheet cash flows. Next, it is over-aggregative, which distribution of assets and liabilities within individual buckets is not considered. Mismatches within buckets can be substantial. Besides that, it ignores the effects of runoffs.

In 1964, the club was expanded into a scientific society, named the Society for Developmental Biology. In 1964, the Society for the Study of Growth and Development in the United States had also voted to take on the same name, and they took over sponsorship of the journal Developmental Biology in 1966. Consequently, the smaller British society changed to its current name in 1969. Awards Further information: Cheryll Tickle Medal The society administers four annual awards and a studentship.

Eventually the entire Brigade resorted under Far North Command.SADF era Brigade level Sergeant Major insignia =Brigade Training and Exercises = 73 Motorised Brigade would generally make use of the General de Wet Training Range, Tempe, near Bloemfontein. Notably 73 Motorised Brigade was involved in Exercise Thunder Chariot, a Divisional exercise held since 1956, at the Army Battle School. Other exercises included: *Exercise Aggressor 1 *Exercise Turning Wheel *Exercise Excalibur *Exercise Ysbeer both on Lohatla =Operational Activation= As a Citizen Force structure, 73 Motorised Brigade would make use of call-up orders for its personnel to generally report for 3 months service. Headquarters staff would then leave for Tempe near Bloemfontein, where a transfer camp would be established to process troops en route to the operational area in northern South West Africa. Processing of units would include personal documentation, a medical examination, inoculation and the issuing of equipment and weapons. Each unit on completion of the necessary processing, would entrain to the Olienhoutplaat Station for a six-day journey to Grootfontein, the railhead near the Operational Area.Militia Magazine 1990/1991 Year 7 Special Edition Changes over time 73 Motorised Brigade structure was not static, units were substituted as needs were adapted to Two units arrived in 73 Brigade in 1984, namely Rand Light Infantry and 7 Medium Regiment. By 1986 7 Medium Regiment was transferred under direct control of 7 Division but Regiment Uitenhage was transferred in. In 1989 Rand Light Infantry was transferred to Far North Command while the Pretoria Highlanders was added to the Brigade. =From a Conventional Brigade to a COIN Brigade= With the independence of Namibia, the conventional threat dissipated and the Army Command began a process of rationalisation.

For instance, Company ABC is headquartered in France. If Company ABC issues bonds in the United States that are denominated in U.S. dollars, the bonds are Yankee bonds. Yankee bonds are normally issued in tranches, a large debt structure financing arrangement into a lot of portion, each portions have different level of risk, interest rates and maturities, and the value of investment grouping might be extremely high, as much as $1 billion. U.S. investors buy Yankee bonds to branch out into overseas markets. Yankee bonds are same with other bonds which will require the borrower to pay a certain interest rate and principal amount according to the terms of the indenture. Yankee Bonds are administered by the Securities Act of 1933.Coles, M. H. (1981). Foreign Companies Raising Capital in the United States. Journal of Comparative Corporate Law and Securities Regulation 3, 300-319. A non-American company will sell bonds in United States to raise capital from American investors. Therefore, the issuers from non-American company have to register Yankee Bonds with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before offering the bond for sale. Hence, U.S. investors can purchase the securities issued by the foreign entity without worrying about the price fluctuation created by changes in currency exchange rates. Yankee bond prices are mostly influenced by the variations of interest rates in U.S. and the financial condition of the issuer. Return If current interest rates in a foreign company‚Äôs own country are higher than the comparable bond rates in the United States, investors are able to obtain financing capital at a lower cost. A Yankee bond is issued by a non-United State entity in the United State market. Thus, when the size of United State bond market increases and there is more trading activity by U.S. investors, it will bring higher returns to the issuers. Besides, Yankee bonds have few potential advantages for foreign firms seeking to raise new capital.Miller, D. P., & Puthenpurackal, J. J. (2001, January 6). The Costs, Wealth Effects, and Determinants of International Capital Raising: Evidence from Public Yankee Bonds. Journal of Financial Intermediation, 455-485. Risk Yankee bond can represent a win-win opportunity for both issuers and investors. According to Bell (2011), the higher credit risk, the higher the yield bonds, this reflects on the Yankee bond risk. Yankee Bonds frequently offer higher yields for U.S. investors to the yields available on comparable, or even lower-rated of bond issues from U.S. issuers. The foreign investors face credit risk and interest rate risk, due to the fact that exchange rates can change quickly and dramatically. Hence, they affects the total return for non-U.S. investors. Yankee bonds avoid from currency risk by issuing in dollars. Reverse Yankee Bond Yankee bonds have been a backbone of the U.S. fixed-income market for several decades. Since 2003, a type of bonds called Reverse Yankee Bond emerged in the worldwide market. In general, the Reverse Yankee Bond is a bond, mostly of a higher grade, issued by a U.S. company outside the U.S., and denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. This bond is governed by Securities Act of 1933, and later on registered under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). U.S. companies issued a record ‚Ç¨45 billion of euro-denominated bonds in the first seven months of 2015 by taking the advantage of low pricing relative dollars and Europe‚Äôs increasing accessibility to international borrowers.Lloyd, D. (2015). 'Reverse Yankees': a home run for US issuers? An M&G; Investments Fixed Income talking point. The Trump administration has made clear its aim to change the regulatory landscape for businesses, and if the rumoured end to the tax- deductibility of interest expense on debt becomes reality, it would likely lead to further expansion of the reverse-Yankee market. This is because American firms would be incentivized to issue bonds offshore in much the same way that many currently try to book profits overseas, in order to minimize the tax burden on their onshore profits. There are also three further growth that drives this type of bonds: Globalisation, Currency Volatility and issuing euro-denominated debt. Reverse Yankee Bond dominate Euro Bond market Reverse Yankee Bonds enter into European market by foreign issuers, which has emerged for the current year in spite of prosaic name. This is because United State (US) organizations are offering a large and traded into Euro- denominated bonds to reflect diverging monetary policy on either side of the Atlantic.Jackson, G. (2015, November 19). Reverse Yankees dominate euro bond markets. Financial Times. Besides, US bonds yields sitting well over those in the Euro zone, a large number of blue-chip organizations have sold Reverse Yankees bonds to lock in lower borrowing costs. According to (Merkle, 2016), in year 2015 and year 2016 US based issuers issued record volume of Reserve Yankee Bonds to take benefit of low yields in Europe and the disadvantages of the euro.Merkle, M. (2016, March 6). Reverse Yankee Bonds and the New EU Market Abuse Regime. Lexis Practice Advisor Journal. In 2015, the United States was the biggest source of issuers in the Euro bond market. As reported by Dealogic, U.S. backers represented 23% of all euro-designated bond issues in 2016.

They were originally formed out of Louis Bonaparte's royal guard in the Kingdom of Holland. Early history Originally the unit had been raised as Grenadiers of the Royal Guard of Holland in 1806 when Louis Napoleon, brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, was made King of Holland. On July 9, 1810, after the Kingdom of Holland was annexed by the French Empire, the Dutch Grenadiers were incorporated into the French Imperial Guard. Initially numbered 2nd Foot Grenadiers Regiment of the Imperial Guard (2√®me R√©giment de grenadiers √† pied de la Garde imp√©riale), they were part of the Middle Guard. Still dressed in their Dutch white uniforms they marched to Paris where they served for over one and a half years as palace guard. In 1811, when the guard was expanded, the Dutch Grenadiers were renumbered and became the 3rd Foot Grenadiers Regiment. Uniforms When the Dutch Grenadiers were added to the Imperial Guard they had worn their original Dutch royal guard uniforms. They were among the few units to use white uniforms in the French Army after the French Revolution. Afterwards the white main colour was kept though numerous adjustments were made. Cuffs, collar and lapels were crimson. The bowl buttons with the Dutch lion on them changed into flat ones with an imperial eagle. The pouch with the standing Dutch lion was changed into one with the imperial eagle as well. The bearskin caps differed with those from the 1st and 2nd Grenadiers of the guard. Those had 45 cm tall bearskins and where thinner while the 3rd had wider 40 cm tall bearskins. Also the Dutch bearskins did not feature the copper plate with a N and an eagle like the other's; instead having no plate at all. Russian campaign On August 16, 1812, the Grande Armee arrived at Smolensk, the town being defended by 120,00 Russian troops. By 1 in the morning of August 17 Smolensk was in French hands. The stench of the quickly decaying corpses prevented the Guard from enjoying the pleasures of victory in the town. On the 19th a Russian general, found hiding in the town, refused to surrender and was bayoneted by the Grenadiers. On the 24th, the army began to quit Smolensk, for the Russians were withdrawing to defend Moscow. The Regiment survived Borodino intact, like the rest of the Guard infantry who saw no action even after repeated requests that the Guard would tip the battle in Napoleon‚Äôs favour rather than a long drawn-out stalemate. After Krasnoi the 3rd only had 40 men left; and only 7 reached France after the campaign. http://www.militairmagazijn.nl/bronnen/armamentaria/artikel/bronnen_armas_xml_46a29809-1c0c-43ae-9d9e-364e04677596/ References Category:Regiments of Napoleon I's Imperial Guard Category:Military units and formations established in 1810 Category:Military units and formations established in 1815 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1813 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1815 ","title":"Dutch Grenadiers"},{"id":"53936831","text":"Eucithara angiostoma is a small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.WoRMS (2009).

It is administered by the Rosminians. History When the Rosminians (the Institute of Charity) first arrived in Cardiff in 1854, the town had a significant Roman Catholic population but only one place of worship, St David's chapel in the town centre (this building would be replaced in the 1880s by the church which became Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral). In 1858, a site was secured near City Road (then called Plwcca Lane) on a 999-year lease, and the necessary funds were raised. Owing to Anti- Catholicism in the area, plans to extend East Grove, forming a junction with Richmond Road, were scrapped because the objectors did not want a Catholic church fronting a main street. Charles Hanson designed the original church in 1860. The church was initially designed with a tower and spire, but these designs proved over-ambitious, and when the church was opened in 1861, it was without either. The early days of St Peter's were not easy. The area was much- afflicted by poverty and drunkenness, and was far away from the Catholic districts, making work challenging for early priests, and low attendance figures were often a problem. After the conversion of John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute to Catholicism in 1868, and a rigorous fundraising program, the situation began to improve, with the founding of a school in 1872. The presbytery was also added, in Gothic Revival style, designed by W.P. James. In 1883, the tower was finally added at the expense of Lord Bute (the planned spire was never added). The stained glass in the sanctuary dates from 1882, each window costing ¬£160. A statue of St Peter over the church entrance was added in 1912, and additional dormer windows were installed in 1926. As the Cathedral in the city centre had been very badly damaged during a 1941 air raid, pontifical functions moved into St Peter's between 1941 and 1945. St Peter's was also hit by an incendiary bomb, seeing extensive damage to the roof of the lady chapel. This damage was later repaired, and the church was finally consecrated in 1948 after clearing the last of its debts. A parish hall was built in 1955, and the church became a Grade II* listed building in 1975. The school was moved to a different location in 1977, and the old building was demolished in 1981. Between 1970 and 1987, the priest at St Peter's was Father Gil Jones, who welcomed the visiting Pope John Paul II to Cardiff on 2 April 1982. The church was extensively redecorated in 2001. = Organs = The first organ at St. Peter's was a two-manual English-style instrument built by Thompson and Shackell. It was completely rebuilt in 1963 by R.V. Gill. In 2004, a large donation in the will of Sir Julian Hodge allowed for a new organ to be installed, which was named in his honour. The three-manual Continental-style organ was built by the Swiss firm and was completed in 2006. The inaugural recital was given by Dame Gillian Weir on 4th November 2006.

The seat was strategically relevant as New Zealand First leader Winston Peters threatened to unseat the safe National position. Labour Party leader Andrew Little did not oppose strategic voting, saying \\"We have a candidate in the race, and she's a good candidate, and she's somebody who we want in Parliament. I have a duty to back her. But in the end, I want Northlanders to exercise their choice, to see that they could make a difference here.

Vincent-Joseph van Steenkiste, his real name, was instrumental in the adoption of the modern concert flute. He is the younger brother of Julie Dorus-Gras, the father of the singer and pianist Juliette Vansteenkiste called Dorus, known after her marriage as Rabaud-Dorus, and Henri Rabaud's grandfather. Family and training The birth name of Louis Dorus is Vincent Joseph van Steenkiste called Dorus. Dorus has been the nickname of the family since the 18th century, probably since the arrival of his great-great-grandfather Theodorus in Valenciennes. In 1705 he was a knave-worker (role of capitations) and came from Kortrijk. He is at the origin of all the bearers of the name in the Valenciennois. His family has no ties with another bourgeois family Van Steenkiste, originally from Thielt. Vincent Joseph van Steenkiste was born 1 March 1812 in Valenciennes.Civil State of Valenciennes. The act does not give him the nickname Dorus His mother, Catherine Lionnois, was born in Nancy on 15 May 1772. Vincent Joseph's father, Aim√© Joseph Ghislain van Steenkiste, born 21 June 1772 in Valenciennes,√âtat Civil de Valenciennes: mariage du 24 prairial an 12 was a former lieutenant in the Grande Arm√©e, reconverted into trade and conductor of an orchestra at the Valenciennes theater. His grandfather Jean Fran√ßois Joseph was a painter, his great-grandfather Fran√ßois Joseph was master mulquinier in Valenciennes. Vincent-Joseph quickly became interested in music, which he learned with his father. He went to study at the Paris Conservatory where he obtained the first prize in 1828. Dorus married 8 March 1836 in the 11th arrondissement of Paris with a daughter of painter Jean-Baptiste Singry (Notre Dame de Nancy, 1 March 1782 - Paris 1824), √âmilie (born 11 August 1813 in Paris, died 19 September 1897 in √âtretat). Three children resulted from this marriage. His daughter Juliette married religiously on 24 October 1867 in Saint-Roch, Paris with Hippolyte Rabaud, a cellist at the conservatoire de Paris.Le M√©nestrel, 20‚Äì27 October 1876. Career From 1828 to 1830, Dorus played at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s. During these years, he gave concerts, and impressed those who listened to him, as testified by the newspapers of the time devoted to music: Le M√©nestrel praised \\"The flute solo executed with so much taste and perfection by Mr. Dorus, has earned this young artist the applause of the whole venue\\". From 1835 to 1866, Dorus was a solo flautist at the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des concerts du Conservatoire of Paris and succeeded Jean-Louis Tulou, at the Conservatoire in 1860. This coincided with the fiercely debated adoption of the modern 1847 Boehm flute. Dorus had been leading the adoption of this instrument, performing on the inventor Boehm's designs from the 1830s. He was the origin of the \\"Dorus key\\" along with Louis Lot, and this retrograde improvement was added to the Boehm design first by Lot and then the other key makers of the time. At the height of his musical career, he was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur by Marshall Vaillant in the name of Emperor Napol√©on III.The digitized record for awarding the Legion of Honor is available on the website of the Chancellery Legion of Honor and Chevalier of the Second Empire. This distinction (by virtue of the Code of March 16, 1852, which repeated the code of Napoleon I granting nobility to the Chevaliers of the Legion of Honor, abrogated by the Second Republic and restored by Napoleon III) gave Louis Dorus the title of Imperial Knight. This title was transmitted to his heirs, in particular the Rabaud. In addition, Louis Dorus was a Freemason. End of life Louis Dorus retired with his fortune in 1868. He was domiciled in Paris on the Rue de Copenhague and then in the Rue de Londres. He often went on holiday in √âtretat, where he died on June 9, 1896. A street in the city bears his name. Friends and acquaintances Louis Dorus and his elder sister Julie Dorus-Gras mostly rubbed shoulders with musicians: Hector Berlioz, Giuseppe Verdi, Fromental Hal√©vy and Giacomo Meyerbeer, for whom Julie Dorus-Gras played the role of Alice in Robert le diable. Vincent van Steenkiste witnessed the death of his brother-in-law Simon Victor Gras, first violinist at the Paris Opera in √âtretat on 4 July 1876 and the birth of his grandson Henri Rabaud.

In popular discourse he is known as father of Manuel Irujo Ollo, a Basque political leader. In scholarly historiographic realm he is acknowledged mostly as defense attorney of Sabino Arana during his trials of 1896 and 1902. Politically Irujo is considered a typical case of an identity located in- between Carlism and emerging Spain's peripheral nationalisms, in this case the Basque one.

Early career Estella, Third Carlist War In historiography political antecedents of Daniel are summarized as \\"scarcely homogeneous\\". Some of his paternal uncles engaged in Tafallese Cristinos militia and ancestors of his wife were distinguished Estella Liberals.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 50-2 Garc√≠a-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, pp. 34-5 It is clear, however, that the Carlist leaning prevailed; apart from Daniel's father and other paternal unclesespecially the older brother of Manuel, Mat√≠as, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 22-25 also his maternal uncle, Sebasti√°n Urra Jord√°n, held various posts in the party and represented it in the Cortes.a priest since 1854, he was professor at the Pamplona seminar in the 1860s. Actively engaged in Carlist administration in Navarre during the war, he was member of Diputaci√≥n Foral del Reino de Navarra. Briefly on exile, since 1884 served as a catehdral canon in Le√≥n As it was him appointed by late Manuel cabezalero of his children,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 35 Urra has contributed to their Carlist outlook.Garc√≠a-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, pp. 24-25 Already as a child in Carlist-held Estella Daniel used to collect unexploded cartridges fired by the governmental troops to make sure they do not hurt the Carlists,Paul Vignaux, Manuel de Irujo: ministre de la R√©publique dans la guerre d'Espagne, 1936-1939, Paris 1986, , p. 84, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 43 and he admitted to having \\"sucked\\" Carlism when a child.as he admitted later, \\"hab√≠a yo mamado el carlismo, como tambi√©n vosostros lo mamasteis\\", quoted after Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 59 Education in Ordu√±a college, managed by the Jesuits, is likely to have reinforced this stand; also during academic years in Valladolid Irujo remained in the company of Carlism-minded friends.Garcia- Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 44 Nothing is known about Irujo's engagement either in the Carlist youth organization or in the party structures in the 1880s. However, he demonstrated particular interest in one element of the Carlist political program: restoration of traditional legal provincial establishments, the fueros. He seemed heavily influenced by his brother-in-law Estanislao Aranzadi, co-founder of Asociaci√≥n Euskara de Navarra and its daily, Lau- buru;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 102 politically the grouping tended to fuerismo,in 1883 Lau-Buru referred to Irujo as a close friend, Lau-Buru 05.06.83, available here with return to foral regime placed as the central if not exclusive objective.the fueristas were hostile to Carlism; they rather considered the movement \\"mausoleum of the past\\", somewhat stuck in a millenarian format, compare Lau-Buru 17.09.86, available here Apart from personal links and subscription to fuerista periodicals Irujo did not engage politicallyGarcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 48 before in 1887 he was offered a job in the Jesuit Deusto college.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 57, 207 He assumed the chair of Procedimientos Judiciales y Pr√°ctica Forense and settled in Bilbao either that year or the following one. His focus on fueros matured into a treaty, produced at unspecified time though most likely in the mid-1890s, and intended as sort of a textbook for his Deusto disciples.the manual was titled ¬°Un hombre! Historia del Derecho v√°sco, escrita por el mismo y explicada a sus disc√≠pulos. The text was published in 1932 by one of Irujo‚Äôs disciples. It diivded the history of the region into 3 parts: 1) prior to incorporation into Castille, 2) until 1839, and 3) after 1839. Present-day scholars considers the 1932 printout a reliable insight into Irujo‚Äôs views, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 57-9 It advanced a thesis that until 1839 Navarre and the Vascongadas enjoyed the status of sovereign entities, united with the rest of peninsula mostly by means of personal union. Joaquin Llorens In 1893 Navarre was rocked by the so-called Gamazada, opposition to a ministerial attempt to scrap remnants of the provincial fiscal autonomy. The Carlist deputy to the Cortes from Estella, Juan V√°zquez de Mella, in name of \\"nosotros, fueristas y regionalistas\\"Mar√≠a del Mar Larraza Micheltorena, La Gamazada en el contexto de la pol√≠tica navarra de fin de siglo, [in:] Pr√≠ncipe de Viana 56/204 (1995), pp. 188-189 voiced against the project in the parliament, joined by another Carlist and the only non-Navarrese deputy who voted against it, Joaqu√≠n Llorens.Angel Garc√≠a-Sanz Marcotegui, La insurrecci√≥n fuerista en 1893. Foralismo oficial vesus foralismo popular durante la Gamazada, [in:] Pr√≠ncipe de Viana 49 (1988), p. 696 Irujo most likely remained in touch with the two; when Llorens was cheered in Estella upon return from Madrid, he delivered his triumphant addresses from the balcony of Irujo's house.El Tradicionalista 29.09.93, available here Similarly, the following year Irujo was in Castej√≥n, the first major Navarrese train station, organizing welcome of the Navarrese diputaci√≥n returning from negotiations in Madrid.Gorka Fuentes Megina, El nacionalismo vasco en \\"El Eco de Navarra\\" [MA thesis Universidad Navarra], Pamplona 2013, pp. 20-21. In his article, published 9 years later and intended as homage to Arana, Irujo described the Castejon event as an exclusively nationalist affair, Garc√≠a-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 81-82 Arana link Bizkaitarra, 1894 When in Bilbao Irujo resumed his friendship with the Arana brothers and in 1894 he subscribed to their review Bizkaitarra,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 61 though he did not join the early Basque nationalist organisation, Euskeldun Batzokija. During Gamazada he introduced Arana to the Navarrese fueristas; it was also in 1894 that at one point, taken over by Arana's harangue, he declared \\"I am your man, though I keep being a Carlist\\".\\"soy de los tuyos, per√≥ sin dejar de ser carlista\\". In a nutshell, his view on Vascongadas and Navarre towards Spain was \\"unidad de Rey e independencia de Reino\\", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 59-61 His relations with the Aranas got closer; when in 1895 they faced trial, charged with multiple offences related to reportedly Basque-nationalist, anti- Spanish background,in 1895 there were lawsuits planned against Arana, for assault on Filomena Soltura, for articles published on 21.07.95 in Bizkaitarra, for his responsibility as president of Euskeldun Batzokija and for an anonymous article published on 05.09.95 (Arana refused to disclose its author), Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 61 Irujo was initially supposed to defend Luis Arana in court.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 64-64 The plan was changed and in 1896 he defended Sabino Arana, freed on bail.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 64 Irujo's defense line was that Arana violated no law;Irujo‚Äôs speech (or its version) went to print in 1913 as Inocencia de un patriota. Notable defensa del fundador del partido nacionalista Don Sabino de Arana y Goiri ante el Tribunal por el ilustre Abogado D. Daniel de Irujo he went on to claim that his client campaigned against 1841 regulations, which he was perfectly entitled to do, apart from representing legitimate aspirations of \\"pueblo euskaldun\\", embodied in the God and Old Rights slogan.El√≠as Am√©zaga, Biograf√≠a sentimental de Sabino Arana, Tafalla 2003, , p. 264 With Irujo fully successful, Arana was absolved.Fuentes Megina 2013, pp. 26-27 In the late 1890s Irujo and the Aranas got even closer. In 1897 Irujo was asked to review El Partido Carlista y los Fueros Vasko-Nabarros, a pamphlet written by Arana and denouncing the Carlist vision as \\"plain regionalism\\".detailed discussion in Jos√© Ignacio F√≠nez Garc√≠a, Fuerismo tradicionalista y nacionalismo vasco [MA thesis Universidad de Salamanca], Salamanca 2013, pp. 83-93 Formally Irujo was to ensure that the document provides no basis for legal action;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 72 it is neither clear whether he contributed to the political content nor how he reconciled the task with his Carlist identity.one scholar claims that appearance of El Partido Carlista y los Fueros Vasko-Nabarros changed Carlist perception of the nascent Basque political movement; until 1897 Carlism did not consider the Basque nationalism any force to be reckoned with, F√≠nez Garc√≠a 2013, p. 94 He helped the Aranas also otherwise, e.g. propagating their new periodical, Berritarra, in Estella, or contributing to pro-nationalist turn of a Pamplona daily El Fuerista.Irujo mediated between Arana and jefe of the daily, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 73. El Fuerista was originally founded in 1888 as a daily of an ofshoot Carlist branch, the Integrists, compare El Fuerista entry, [in:] Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia online, available here However, Irujo fell short of open political access to the Aranistas and their Partido Nacionalista Vasco. Prior to the 1898 elections to the Biscay diputaci√≥n provincial Sabino Arana suggested that Irujo runs as his representative, but the latter declined the offer.Mauro Elizondo, Sabino Arana. El hombre y su trayectoria, Bilbao 1992, , p. 27 His exact views are not clear; it is not known what his opinion was about the conflict and rapprochement between the Aranistas and Euskalerriacos or general twists and turns of the PNV strategy. At some point between 1899 and 1902 he entered Centro Vasco in Bilbao and subscribed to militant nationalist periodicals, La Patria and Euskalduna.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 73 Arana in prison In 1902 Sabino Arana was detained in relation to a telegram message he intended to send to president Roosevelt, congratulating him on recognition of Cuba, until 1898 the Spanish possession. The charges advanced referred to assault on Spanish territorial integrity. The defendant again asked Irujo to represent him. In general terms the defense mounted was very much similar to that of 1896, pointing to Basque rights and revocation of the 1840s regulations;\\"Arana no busca la independencia sino el estado de libertades anterior a 1839; no existe delito en el telegrama puesto que no se curs√≥\\", quoted after Javier G. Chamorro, Bitarte: humanidades e historia del conflicto vasco-navarro , s.l. 2009, , p. 204 Irujo reiterated his claim that nationalism was not equal to separatism.Arantzazu Ametzaga Iribarren, Sabino Arana Goiri y su abogado defensor, Daniel Irujo Urra, juicio de 1896, [in:] Nabarralde service, available here In terms of specific charges he argued that the telegram message intended expressed admiration and nothing more.Am√©zaga 2003, p. 269 At the final stage aided by Teodoro Aguirre,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 74, Jos√© Antonio de Aguirre y Lecube, Escape Via Berlin: Eluding Franco in Hitler's Europe, Reno 1944, p. 3 Irujo again emerged triumphant; the defendant was acquitted.1902 Irujo defended also other in other lawsuits, namely against Centro Vasco and one of its members, D√°maso Arana; he was successful in both, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 76-7 He refused to charge his clientGarcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 76 and maintained close friendship with Sabino Arana until the latter's death in 1903.following the death of Arana Irujo published one of his very few known literary pieces known, La bandera nacionalista vulgo Bikaitarra, reproduced in Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 80 Estella oak affair Guernica oak, 1890s Throughout the entire Bilbao period Irujo maintained close links with Navarrein 1901 Irujo was emong co-founders of Circulo Navarro in Bilbao and entered its Junta Directiva; he also remained inscriptred into the Pamplona Colegio de Abogados in Pamplona, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 77, 85. His visits were acknowledged in the Navarrese press, see El Eco de Navarra 17.06.00, available here and with Estella. Around 1904 he returned to his native city; exact reasons remain unclear and perhaps are related to taking care of local family business.Irujo owned some robadas of land near Estella, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 219; upon return he was growing vineyards, Anasagasti 1975, p. 16 He re-entered the local Carlist c√≠rculo; around that time the Carlist jefe in Vascongadas, Tirso Olaz√°bal,the issue is not entirely clear. Olaz√°bal was the Carlist jefe in Vascongadas ,but not in Navarre, where the leader at the time was Francisco Martinez, Agust√≠n Fern√°ndez Escudero, El marqu√©s de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biograf√≠a politica [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 2012, p. 443 offered him the party jefatura in the merindad of Estella and Irujo accepted.Olaz√°bal‚Äôs proposal is mentioned may time in Irujo‚Äôs biography, but never with a clear information that he accepted the offer, see Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 10, 15, 90, 153, 156. From the background it might be understood that he did For the first time he also openly engaged in political strife. In the local realm dominated by the Conservativesin Estella named Ochoistas, after local Conservative leader Enrique Ochoa Cintora and the Carlists,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 92 in 1905 he decided to represent the latter when running for the Estella ayuntamiento;some presented him as independent Carlist , Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 97 PNV at the time did not have its representatives in the area and explicitly banned their sympathizers from voting other parties.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 95 Irujo was successfulthe Ochoistas won 5 tickets and the Carlists claimed 3. Possibly both parties closed a political deal beforehand, which guaranteed success of any of their candidates, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 95-96 and though initially his mandate was revoked on procedural ground,it was raised that Irujo was not resident in Estella and that as juez municipal he was not allowed to be a concejal at the same time. Irujo claimed he was resident and that as juez he was allowed to stand. Indeed, soon ‚Äì and unlike his father 40 years earlier ‚Äì he resigned his juez assignement, El Eco de Navarra 06.12.05, available here he was eventually reinstated in early 1906.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 97-8 In line with official requirements, he declared his political affiliation as Carlist.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 90 The first year of his tenure was a routine one,as a concejal he took part in ayuntamiento stand against the 1906 Ley de Asociaciones, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 107-108 perhaps except minor Carlist political demonstrations he took part in.when Fernando Primo de Rivera was nominated minister of war in 1907, the Estella ayuntamiento planned to send him a routine congratulation note. Irujo and the Carlists opposed the motion; Primo was the military leader who drove the Carlists from Estella in 1876, Garcia- Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 226 In 1908 the Aranista Centro Vasco of Bilbao used the services of Irujo's brother-in-law Aranzadi to offer the Estella city a shoot from the Guernica oak, a symbol of vasco-navarrese fueros.Centro Vasco offered 8 shoots to 8 different ayuntamientos in Vascongadas and Navarre Irujo passed the proposal to ayuntamiento,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 108 which accepted the offerthe offer itself was by no means unusual. In 1898 the Biscay Diputaci√≥n Provinvial offered a shoot of the Guernica oak to the Navarrese Diputaci√≥n Provincial; it was accepted and the shoot was planted, Fuentes Megina 2013, pp. 29-31 and in a pompous ceremony few months later planted the shoot at a patio of a local school.exact location of the spot where the shoot was planted is not clear. Sources refer to it as \\"internal patio of Escuelas Pias\\". The school exists today as the Basque ikastola, yet it seems that the spot is at the courtyard of what is now the nearby Casa de Cultura Fray San Diego; it is not marked anywhow Navarrese press remained largely sympathetic, but a Liberal daily raised alarm, claiming that the local self-government fuels Basque separatism.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 115-116, 229 As nationwide press followed suit the issue turned into a scandal, especially that the ceremony was marked by Basque and Navarrese flavor with almost total absence of official references to Spain;e.g. during an evening orchestra concert the same day the only songs played were those from a Basque and Navarrese repertoire, while the invitation letter commenced with \\"Gora Euzkadi!\\" When speaking, an invited guest from Centro Vasco made frequent references to \\"la naci√≥n pirenaica\\" and concluded with \\"Gora Nabarra! Gora Euzkadi!\\" moderate Irujo's addressIrujo he was specifically asked by the mayor, who at the last minute developed some anxiety about \\"certain flavor\\" of the planned feast, to avoid controversial and personal references. According to some scholars, it was the reason why he mentioned neither Carlism nor Llorens. On the other hand, some claim that Irujo most likely mentioned Arana in his address, Arantzazu Ametzaga Iribarren, El √°rbol de Gernika en Nabarra, [in:] Noticias de Navarra 15.02.17, available here was interrupted by angry \\"Viva Espa√±a!\\" cries from the disgusted crowd.perhaps the most controversial passage of Irujo‚Äôs address was his reference to \\"treason of Maroto\\", the 1839 accord concluded by the Carlist leader general Maroto with the governmental commander. It was at this point that several vivas to Espa√±a were heard, apparently in disapproval of Irujo‚Äôs comments, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 112, 114, Fuentes Megina 2013, pp. 40-42 The council declared they had been unaware that the shoot originated from Centro Vasco and suggested having been maneuvered into a separatist affair, blaming Aranzadi and Irujo for the miscommunication. Estella At the council sittings and in the press Irujo claimed that ayuntamiento was perfectly aware of the shoot origins,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 126 yet his arguments were rejected. The shoot was sent back to Centro Vasco and replaced by new ones, officially provided by the Biscay diputaci√≥n.some suggests that the Estella council was genuinely concerned that shoots provided originally were not original, Fuentes Megina 2013, p. 42 They were planted 3 weeks after the first ceremony. The re- implantation was an equally public though somewhat less pompous event; this time the Spanish and Navarrese features were carefully balanced, while the Basque ones were absent.the original implantation took place on March 15, 1908. The second one took place on April 8, 1908. Among flags of Spain and vivas to Espa√±a, Marcha Real was played a number of times, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 140. Exact fate of the shoot is not clear; according to one source, it grew into a tree and at unspecified time and in unspecified circumstances it was cut down. Another tree was planted in 2004, but it was cut down by unknown perpetrators in 2009, compare Hispanismo service, available here. Some identify the culprits as \\"fanaticos Navarristas\\", see e.g. Xabier Zabaltza, Gernikako arbola, un himno huerfano, [in:] Historia Contempor√°nea 54 (2017), p. 235. This would suggest that the oak keeps generating political controversies, in this case related to Navarrismo and its opposition to Basque nationalism Embittered with the city council blaming him for the affair, in the immediate aftermath Irujo ceased to attend its sittings, excusing himself for the absence.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 155 Later in 1908 the ayuntamiento admitted he was right, but this did not make Irujo change his mind. In early 1909 the mayor and his deputy resigned; technically, as segundo teniente de alcalde Irujo was becoming the interim alcalde. At this point he formally resigned his counselor mandate and did not stand in the successive elections of May 1909. From Carlist to Nationalist Carlist standard from 1935 Initially the Carlist El Pensamiento Navarro acknowledged the first implantation with sympathy, praising the homage to \\"nuestras libertades tradicionales\\" and complaining only about lack of Irujo's references to Carlist champions of Navarrese rights like Llorens.according to some scholars Irujo did not mention Llorens in his address complying with the mayor‚Äôs request to avoid controversial political references, and the Carlist press was perfectly aware of that, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 114, 124, Fuentes Megina 2013, p. 42 However, soon the party press ‚Äì especially in Vascongadas ‚Äì assumed a hostile tone; the Gipuzkoan La Voz de Guip√∫zcoa lambasted Irujo as \\"concejal reaccionario\\"this tag was later repeated by other titles elsewhere, see e.g. a Valencian daily El Pueblo, 17.03.08, available here, or as \\"individuo muy significado por sus tendencias reaccionarias\\", La Correspondencia Militar 17.03.08, available here and El Correo de Guip√∫zcoa linked the event to venomous anti-Spanish separatism.including groups advancing the \\"muera Espa√±a\\" cries, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 127-8 Carlist circlesGarcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 121 and provincial leaderson March 27 the Carlist tycoon marqu√©s de Valdespina congratulated the ayuntamiento for their \\"entusiasmo el patri√≥tico acuerdo\\", ending his address with \\"vivas a Espa√±a y a Euskeria\\", Fuentes Megina 2013, p. 41 were sending messages congratulating the ayuntamiento on their decision to send the original shoot back. Another Carlist in the council, Nicanor Larr√°inzar Senosi√°in, led an all-out charge on Irujo, also publicly,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 117, 133 claiming that his support for the Aranistas was incompatible with Carlism.both Irujo and Larr√°inar address their opened letters to their opponents, virulently listing their official titles as received \\"por gracia de su Majestad don Alfonso XIII\\", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 145. Such a phrase, normally quite innocent, sounded like an insult when penned by a Carlist Irujo denied separatist charges, charged his opponent with political opportunismGarcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 142-143 and initially confirmed his Carlist identity. Things changed when Tirso Olaz√°bal congratulated Larr√°inzar on his stand.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 148 In a public letter to Olaz√°bal Irujo considered himself disauthorised; speculating that apparently he had been erroneous as to fuerista objectives of the Carlists, he declared leaving Carlism.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 156 In a letter to Luis Arana Irujo proclaimed that from then on he would not be any \\"carlo-bizkaitarra\\", but \\"nacionalista vasco a secas\\".\\"en Bilbao me llamaban carlo-bizkaitarra y ten√≠an raz√≥n; ahora no tengo nada de cario, y me abrazo en cuerpo y alma a Jel [Jaungoikoa Eta Lagizarrak], sin aditamento de ning√∫n g√©nero\\", quoted after Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 157, see also here However, when in late 1908 offered a post in Navarrese Partido Nacionalista Vasco structures, he declined. The reasons are not clear. Some scholars speculate that aware of growing controversy between Arana and Aranzadi, Irujo could have not brought himself to taking a stand; another reason might have been growing rivalry between a radical Navarrese wing of Evangelista de Iberopadre Evangelista de Ibero, who nurtured strongly anti-Carlist views, remained on close terms at least with Irujo‚Äôs sons, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 88 and a more moderate one championed by his brother-in-law.Garcia- Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 158-9, 160-161 Nevertheless, he remained in touch with PNV activists both in Navarre and in Biscay. When their new Navarrese periodical Napartarra was launched in 1911, Irujo featured as one of its collaborators.Napartarra, [in:] Gran Enciclopedia Navarra online , available here Some students speculate that had it not been for his premature death,Irujo and his wife developed pneumonia; she got better but he did not, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 164 Irujo would have represented the Nationalists in forthcoming elections.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 163 ikurri√±a One scholar concludes that indeed, apparent Irujo's attempt to match Nationalist and Carlist objectives was mission impossible.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 15 He identifies Irujo's political position as \\"radical fuerismo\\",Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 157 its essence being reversal to pre-1839 regime.Garc√≠a-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, p. 23 Deprived of anti-Spanish venome.g. in 1901, when organizing San Ferm√≠n feast in Circulo Navarro in Bilbao, he ended th event with Vivas to Espa√±a, for which he was later criticised by militant Basque press, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 78 and far from classic separatism, it envisioned Vasco-Navarrese area as sovereign entities united with other Spanish political bodies by a common monarch. It also did not include \\"los aspectos m√°s negativos del aranismo\\", i.e. racism.Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 17 It is not clear to what extent Irujo embraced nationalism as emerging in Europe of the time. He certainly acknowledged and appreciated separated Basque identity, yet it seems that his vision of Basque commonality was based on geography, religion,Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 203; he sent a postcarcd with sagrado coraz√≥n to his nephew and brought up own children in religious zeal history and culture rather than on ethnicity.claiming that the only ambition of \\"nacionalidades vascas\\" was return to pre-1839 rule, Irujo noted also that \\"en una palabra, todo cuanto una naci√≥n necesita para regirse y gobernarse por s√≠ sin injerencias extra√±as aunque constituya parte integrante de un Estado compuesto de nacionalidades distintas\\", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 145 On the other hand, he hailed the newly invented icon of Basque nationalism, ikurri√±a,referred to as \\"shroud which covers all Basques\\", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 81-82 and called for unification of all Basques in \\"tierra euzkeriana\\". Another scholar considers Irujo a typical case of transitory identity from Carlismaccording to a contemporary scholar, the Carlists of the time boasted restoration of fueros as their war cry, but in fact they adjourned it ad calendas graecas, and approached it mostly as means of mobilizing support, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 11. As one of the fuerista activists put it, before their own advent \\"la reintegraci√≥n foral era un sue√±o dorado; nadie pensaba que pudiera llegar a ser una realidad. Confes√©moslo: √©ramos fueristas, pero no ten√≠amos fe, no ten√≠amos esperanza. Bastaba para satisfacer nuestra conciencia afirmar el deseo de la reintegraci√≥n foral y precisar bien el alcance de nuestro deseo\\", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 11-12 to peripheral nationalism,he also summarised Irujo‚Äôs political trajectory somewhat differently, namely that \\"carlista en sus or√≠genes, evolucion√≥ hacia el nacionalismo vasco a finales del siglo xix, para regresar, a principios del Novecientos, a la √≥rbita carlista\\", Jordi Canal, ¬øEn busca del precedente perdido?

Biography Christiansen studied theology during 1904-1909 and worked as a language teacher for Finnish and Sami for priest sent to Finnmark, but he was not himself ordained as a priest. Instead, he took an interest in folkloristics under the guidance of Moltke Moe (1859‚Äì1914). He received a scholarship for a half-year's stay in Finland in 1912, where he studied under Kaarle Krohn (1863‚Äì1933). During 1914-1916 he studied in Copenhagen, studying under Axel Olrik (1864‚Äì1917). He also visited Lund University and studied under Carl Wilhelm von Sydow (1878‚Äì1952). In 1919, Christiansen received money from the Nansen Fund to conduct field studies in Ireland and he published The Vikings and the Viking Wars in Irish and Gaelic Tradition in 1931 drawing on that research. He undertook to learn Irish, in Ballyferriter, Co. Kerry, at the suggestion of Carl Marstrander. In 1920, Osborn Bergin wrote a poem ('Do Ridire Mhac Giolla Chr√≠ost') to Christiansen urging him to return to Ireland. He became archivist of the newly-established Norwegian National Archives in 1921. Christiansen married Karin Lundbad, whom he had met in Lund, in 1921. The couple had five children, living in Blommenholm outside of Oslo. Christiansen conducted comparative research in fairy tales, comparing the Scandinavian folklore and Irish folklore traditions in particular. In his The Migratory Legends (1958) he proposed a type catalogue for the classification of \\"migratory legends\\" (a calque of German Wanderlegenden, i.e. folk-tales transmitted via trans-cultural diffusion), by motif, exemplified with examples from Norwegian folklore. Christiansen became full professor for folkloristics at Oslo University in 1952. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from University College Dublin in 1954. He retired in 1956 and spent a semester at Indiana University Bloomington at the invitation of Stith Thompson , and 1957/9 returned to Dublin, working with Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (1903‚Äì1996). In 1958, he became chairman of the Commission International des Arts et Traditions Populaires of UNESCO. He went on to publish his Studies in Irish and Scandinavian Folktales (1959), European Folklore in America (1962) and Folktales of Norway (1964). Migratory Legends (1958) In his 1958 Migratory Legends, Christiansen proposed a system of eight major categories (with subtypes), as follows: *3000-3025: \\"The Black Book of Magic\\" *3030-3080: \\"Witches and Witchcraft\\" *4000-4050: \\"Legends of the Human Soul, of Ghosts and Revenants\\" *4050-4090: \\"Spirits of Rivers, Lakes and the Sea\\" *5000-5050: \\"Trolls and Giants\\" *5050-6070: \\"The Fairies\\" *7000-7020: \\"Domestic Spirits\\" *7050-8025: \\"Local Legends of Places, Events and Persons\\" See also *Norwegian folklore *Norwegian Folktales *Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification systems *Motif (folkloristics) *Fairy cup legend, ML type 6045 References =Sources=  * * Category:Norwegian folklorists Category:Collectors of fairy tales Category:Fairy tale scholars Category:University of Oslo faculty Category:1886 births Category:1971 deaths ","title":"Reidar Thoralf Christiansen"},{"id":"53937489","title":"We're All Alright!"},{"id":"53937512","text":"The 2017 BBL Playoffs was the concluding postseason of the 2016‚Äì17 Basketball Bundesliga season.

Individuals with emotional spectrum disorder (ESD) include those diagnosed with mood regulating disorders, including: * Depression * Bipolar disorder and related conditions including mania * Persistent anxiety * Borderline personality disorder * Adjustment disorder __TOC__  Commonalities  In psychoanalytic theory, splitting and transference are frequent and common defense mechanisms among ESD patients. In such cases, the individual is unable regulate emotions over perception of objective reality. When those emotions align with objective reality, it goes unnoticed by others. When such emotions conflict with objective reality, the individual is unable to reconcile the two, and their hyperactive emotions rewrite the events of reality in the individual's mind as if that was the objective reality. The individual thinks \\"I would not feel this way if events did not occur like this, and given that I feel this way, events must have occurred like this.\\" Once the patient has rationalized their revised perception of reality, additional stimuli challenging that perception typically causes further depression and/or anxiety until such stimuli can be rationalized to fit the patient's revised perception of reality. In advanced cases of such disorders, and especially with bipolar and borderline personality disorders, some patients react to such challenging stimuli with violence to others or even self-harm.  Gender and biology  Over 25% of women in the United States are actively prescribed antidepressants, anti- anxiety medications, anti-psychotics, or other mood-altering drugs. Women And Prescription Drugs: One In Four Takes Mental Health Meds Women have been measured as suffering from emotional spectrum disorders at 2.5x greater rates than men. Astounding increase in antidepressant use by Americans One prevailing theory suggests abnormalities in hormone levels during prenatal development causes predisposition to spectrum disorders. Autism spectrum disorder can be compared as hypoactivity of emotions, feelings, and other aspects used in emotive, social communications, while emotional spectrum disorder is the hyperactivity thereof. Abnormally high fetal testosterone is likely to be a cause of autism spectrum disorder, while increased fetal estrogen may cause emotional spectrum disorder.Linking autism, sex, gender and prenatal hormones Because males typically have over 10 times the testosterone as females, and autism spectrum is strongly linked to excessive prenatal testosterone, males have significantly higher incidence of autism spectrum disorder than females. Conversely, because females have significantly higher estrogen than males, and emotional spectrum disorder is strongly linked to excessive prenatal estrogen, females have significantly higher incidence of emotional spectrum disorder than males.

Radstube means something like \\"wheelhouse\\" or \\"wheel room\\" and is the German mining term for a surface or underground structure designed to house a water wheel in order to drive a flatrod system. The fast-developing mining industry in Europe in the Middle Ages led to big increases in the quantities of materials used, mineshafts being sunk to ever increasing depths and, in particular, sharply rising demands on the water management of mines, all of which required suitable sources of power. One option for fulfilling these requirements was hydropower and the construction of water wheels. These were enclosed in buildings, or Radstuben, to protect them from the weather. The name Radstube was later also applied to underground chambers designed to accommodate a water wheel. The installation of underground Radstuben was particularly difficult and expensive.

History  Created by Christian Troadec in the 2010 regional elections under the slogan, \\"We'll make Brittany again\\" where the party got 4.29% of the vote. The movement was created as a left wing autonomist party that is independent of the PS. The main spokesman of the party, Christian Troadec, the mayor of Carhaix-Plouguer and a general councillor in the township of Carhaix-Plouguer. The party also includes Christian Derrien, mayor of Langonnet and a councillor in Gourin After the success in the regional elections where the party gained two elected representatives, the leaders then affirmed that they wanted to run in bigger elections notably senatorial and legislative. In the 2011 senatorial elections, the MBP participated in a union with other left wing parties and nominated H√©l√®ne Le Ny to contest the senatorial seat in Morbihan held by Jo√´l Labb√©, an EELV senator. In the legislative elections in 2012, Christian Troadec ran in Finist√®re's 6th constituency and came third with 19.22% of the vote.

The party managed to get 3.05% which allowed it to get reimbursed. This result came despite the presence of an alliance led by the Breton Democratic Union as well as the Breizhistance with help from the NPA. In the 2015 Regional Elections, the party stood under the \\"Yes Brittany\\" coalition with the Breton Democratic Union and received 6.7% of the overall vote in Brittany making Yes Brittany the fourth biggest political force within Brittany. In 2016, both the Breton Democratic Union and Brittany Movement and Progress declared their intention to renew the alliance for the legislative and presidential elections in 2017.

An adept of Wegener's theory, he was the first to precisely reconstruct the layout of the continental masses of Africa, America, Europe and Greenland prior to the fragmentation of Pangaea, thirty years before the article generally credited for this discovery.  Biography  Of Russian origin,. Boris Schuberth, better known as Choubert was born in Saint Petersburg in 1906. He left Russia for Finland in 1917, then for France in 1927. He studied geology at La Sorbonne for two years, then at the ' (now ') in Nancy, where he received his diploma of engineer-geologist. In 1933 he was employed by the Government of Gabon (then a subdivision of French Equatorial Africa). In 1937 he defended his thesis on ' (Geologic study of ancient Gabon terrains). In 1946 he was hired by the ' (presently IRD) and left for French Guiana. In 1949 he founded a multidisciplinary research organization which would become the ' (Institute of the French tropical America) in 1954, then the Guyana office of ORSTOM in 1964. At the end of his stay he was ' and the head of '. In 1960 he came back to continental France. In 1961 he joined the CNRS as a directeur de recherche, then the √âcole des mines de Paris, where he stayed until his retirement in 1976. He then moved to Nice, where he was harboured by the laboratoire de g√©ologie. He died in Nice on December 3, 1983.  Scientific studies  Boris Choubert mainly dedicated himself to three geological fields, of which he significantly advanced the first two:. * prospecting and mining geology; * geological mapping and structural geology; * igneous petrology. = Mining geology = * In Gabon in 1934 Boris Choubert discovered the characteristic minerals, manganite and rhodochrosite, of a huge manganese deposit, which holds a quarter of all world reserves.. * In 1939 he discovered the first diamonds in the alluvial deposits of the Ikoy River basin, near Lambar√©n√© (Estuaire Province, Gabon). He would show later that these deposits are of secondary origin, and that these diamonds come in fact from kimberlites, the same as those from South Africa.. * In Guyane he realized a detailed study of the gold mines of Saint-√âlie and A Dieu Vat, and already drew attention to the problems generated by placer mining.. = Geological mapping = * Boris Choubert achieved, alone or in collaboration, a great number of geological maps at various scales, from mine plans at 1/ to a global tectonic map at 1/, with a particular attention at the magmatic and metamorphic rocks of ancient formations. * In 1935 he published a very important paper. where he reconstructs Paleozoic and Precambrian ranges, and deduces the past existence and contours of the paleocontinent that predated the Atlantic Ocean opening. * In French Guiana he tackles the geological map of the territory ( km) at 1/ scale, a map published in 1949 then, with more details, in 1960.  Boris Choubert and continental drift  = Continental drift in 1935 = Evoked several times between 1596 and 1908, the continental drift concept was chiefly developed and advocated by the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener between 1912 et 1929, on the basis of different criteria, morphological (the nesting of continent shapes, like the Horn of Brazil and the Gulf of Guinea), stratigraphic (stratigraphic continuity between Africa and South America, and complementarity of Paleozoic cratons), paleoclimatic (similarity of Paleozoic striated pebbles of South Africa and South America) and paleontological (same fauna and flora during the Paleozoic era). Wegener's studies obtained but limited success among the geological and geophysical community, for a number of reasons: in part because for every isolated argument one could appeal to coincidence or find some other explanation, but above all because the mechanisms that Wegener invoked as driving drift did not hold water.. Boris Choubert was aware of studies by the South-African geologist Alexander du Toit, who had evidenced the great similarity of ancient South-American, West-African and South-African formations and was a supporter of Wegener's theory. Working on rocks from Gabon, Congo and Brazil, Boris Choubert confirmed the findings of du Toit and in turn became a fervent supporter of continental drift. = Reconstruction of the pre-Atlantic paleocontinent = Boris Choubert's reconstruction of the America-Greenland- Europe-Africa supercontinent (1935). Boris Choubert published in 1935 a reconstruction of the relative positions of America, Africa and Europe before the Triassic. This reconstitution was much more precise than the previous proposals by Wegener. and du Toit,. essentially because Choubert, instead of using coastlines, based his reconstitution on the 1000-m isobath, a much better representation of the limits of continental blocks. That excellent fit was more convincing a proof of continental drift than previous attempts, which left a large gap between Africa and South America. For his reconstruction Boris Choubert dared for the first time the idea that the Iberian Peninsula suffered, after the Triassic, a rotation with respect to the rest of Europe. He also swept the Mid-Atlantic Ridge problem by explaining that it formed posteriorly to Atlantic Ocean opening. The Caribbean Sea does not fit as well as the rest but, as it is known today, it was seriously affected by Cenozoic tectonics. Boris Choubert drew the theory farther than Wegener, who had only considered post-Triassic continental drift. By reconstructing the Paleozoic mountain ranges across the Atlantic (Caledonian range, Hercynian range et Appalachians), he made clear that they were formed by the compression of sediments that had been accumulated between three Precambrian cratons (Canadian Shield and Fennoscandian Shield at north, Gondwana at south). Withdrawing those ranges he concluded that the three cratons had made a single continent at the end of the Precambrian, which was later fragmented during the Paleozoic. Hence he realized that continental drift is a general process, which has affected the Earth all along its geological history. = The fit by Bullard, Everett and Smith = Reconstruction by Bullard et al. of the America-Greenland-Europe-Africa supercontinent (1965). Thirty years later, Edward Bullard and co-authors published a paper. in which a reconstruction similar to Choubert's was achieved with the help of a computer, through the numerical minimisation of distances between continental blocks. This paper rapidly acquired a great reputation among the scientific community, whereas Choubert's work had remained almost unnoticed (and it is even not cited in Bullard et al.'s paper).

Its idea is to represent complex hydrodynamics by a combination of simple flow patterns. This approach is part of the concept of complementary modelling, which was also conceived by Professor Kenig. This concept is based on an efficient combination of modelling methods with different modelling depths. In the context of his research activities, he is involved in kinetic modelling of various processes and phenomena, reactive separation methods, computational fluid dynamics, micro-separation processes and process-related energy efficiency problems. Professor Kenig is one of the founders of the Kompetenzzentrum f√ºr nachhaltige Energietechnik (KET) at Paderborn University. He is currently chairman of the KET board of management.

It served the eastern parts of the town of Pudsey. It was opened to passengers on 1 April 1878 as an intermediate station on the single-track branch line from Bramley to Pudsey Greenside, built by the Great Northern Railway. Freight traffic on this line had already started in 1877. In 1893 the line was double- tracked and extended beyond Pudsey Greenside through Greenside Tunnel towards Laisterdyke and Dudley Hill, forming the Pudsey Loop. Upon the reorganisation of the railways in 1923, the line passed to the London and North Eastern Railway, and in 1948 to the Eastern Region of British Railways. The station was located on a north-south section of the line, south of the bridge of Lowtown street (B6154) across the railway cutting, with the station building standing near the road at the northern end of the station. The platforms flanking the tracks were located west of the station building, the train tracks and goods facilities to the east. The station and the line in its entirety were closed to all traffic on 15 June 1964. The site of the former station is now occupied by housing, and the cutting in its vicinity has been filled in for the most part. A bus stop is located next to the bridge across the former railway line. Pudsey is now served by the station New Pudsey on the Calder Valley Line, opened on 6 March 1967 and located about north of the town centre.

Founded in 1901, it offers Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Science degrees. History Temple University School of Pharmacy was founded in 1901, initially as a two-year program sharing classes with the Medical School. First classes were held in 1901 at College Hall, but moved to Eighteenth and Buttonwood Campus (adjacent to the present Community College of Philadelphia) in 1907. The pharmacy school stayed in this building until 1947. In 1907, School of Pharmacy separated from the Medical School and Dr. John R. Minehart was appointed as the first Dean of Pharmacy, serving until 1932. Dean Minehart oversaw the expansion of School of Pharmacy to a three year course and its accreditation by American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy in 1928. Harvey Evert Kendig succeeded Dean Minehart and oversaw the moving of the School of Pharmacy to a new campus located at 3223 N Broad Street in 1947 which is the current location of Temple University School of Dentistry. Under Dean Kendig, the School of Pharmacy curriculum saw the expansion to a coursework of four years. Joseph B. Sprowles became the Dean of Pharmacy in 1950, serving until 1967. A Master of Science program was established in 1968 in Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs (QA/RA) to serve the needs of professionals in pharmaceutical industry under his guidance. In 1974, School of Pharmacy moved to its current location at 3307 N Broad Street with the help of funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Temple University and federal grants. Peter H. Doukas has been serving the School of Pharmacy since 1990. Under his leadership, the Master's program in QA/RA was moved to the Fort Washington Campus in order to accommodate the increased number of pharmaceutical companies located in the Greater Philadelphia Area. On November 1, 2019, School of Pharmacy saw a change in leadership as Dean Doukas stepped down and was succeeded by Jayanth Panyam.https://pharmacy.temple.edu/node/1286 Academics Temple University School of Pharmacy awards Doctor of Pharmacy degree which is its main offering. In addition, a graduate program in Pharmaceutical Sciences is established with concentrations in Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutics and Pharmacodynamics available offering Master of Science and Doctor of Pharmacy degrees. A Master of Science in Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs has been established since 1968 as the first program of its kind in United States at that time. Kendig Memorial Museum The museum is dedicated to the memory of Dean Harvey Evert Kendig who served the School of Pharmacy from 1907 to 1950. It was opened in 1957 and moved to its current location in 1974. The museum houses fixtures which were originally part of Old Morgan Pharmacy, where Wyeth Brothers worked who went on to found Wyeth. The collection also houses pharmaceutical equipment, specie jars, show globes and other equipment of an apothecary.

Plot In this cartoon short, Donald is the sole- proprietor of a roadside nut butter stand called \\"Don's Nut Butter\\". The stand is in the shape of a giant walnut. Donald begins the day by placing a bucket of nuts into a hopper that will extract the nut from the shell and crush the nut into a butter. The machine starts a conveyor belt of jars and as they pass under the hopper, the jars are filled. Donald is waiting at the end of the line to label and cap the jars and place them on his shelves commenting that, \\"These will sell like hot cakes\\". Donald soon realizes his machine is out of nuts and he must go out to gather more. As he leaves through a backdoor he notices Chip and Dale gathering nuts for the coming winter season. Donald observes the tree they store the nuts in, knocks on the tree to see if anyone's there, then drills a hole in the trunk which fills up his bucket. Donald then happily returns to his stand to start the process again. Chip and Dale fall through the drilled hole only to see their nuts scattered along the ground that Donald spilled as he left. As they gather back up their nuts, Dale sees Donald's stand and faints at the sight of this gigantic nut. Chip revives his friend and he himself marvels at the colossal nut. The two can only imagine at all the meat waiting inside the shell and set about different ways to crack it. Finally the duo get a boulder to roll down hill and crack the top of the stand which alerts Donald who runs out the backdoor looking for the source of the sound. The chipmunks then peer in through the hole in the top and observe Donald's process. They remove a jar from a shelf and, after sampling the butter, quickly decide to take all the jars for their harvest. As they start removing the jars, Dale notices the hopper filling more jars. He removes a jar and sits on the conveyor belt allowing it to fill him with butter. After doing this several times he rides to the end of the line where Donald absent-mindedly labels him and puts a lid on him. Chip removes him thinking he is a jar and bops him on the head for playing around. The two return to removing more jars until Chip drops one which falls onto Donald alerting him of the theft. He sticks his head through the opening at the top where the chipmunks trap him by the neck with branches. Donald watches Dale use his conveyor belt to remove finished jars of nut butter from his stand. Donald then gets angry and frees himself as the chipmunks make their escape. Donald gives chase evading several hazards placed in his way. Eventually Chip and Dale make it back to their tree which Donald runs into, knocking himself out in the process. Using nutshells as helmets, the two chipmunks run outside and peel Donald off the tree. Donald becomes stiff and they carry him to a fallen tree overlooking a cliff. They load him into the tree as if they were loading an army gun of the era. Dale uses a wooden sword to cut a hornet's nest which falls into an open hole in the tree. Both chipmunks then cover their ears as a simulated \\"firing\\" of the gun blasts Donald out over the cliff. The chipmunks run to the end of the tree and watch Donald fall into the river. They then remove their nut shell helmets and bow their heads for a moment of silence before laughing and dancing in victory.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history Hartford's Asylum Hill area was farmland until the mid-1850s, when it began to be developed as a residential area. Collins Street has what is believed to be its oldest house, at #287, which stood on the estate of the Collins family. Over the next few decades the area south of Collins Street was turned into a residential neighborhood much as it is today, with a diversity of architectural styles. Townley Street has one of the more consistent streetscapes, with a collection of brick and brownstone Italianate and Second Empire one and two-family houses. The U formed by Collins, Atwood, and Willard Streets has a series of Shingle style houses, most of which have brick first floors and shingled upper levels and touches of Colonial Revival design. East of Willard, Collins is lined with a row of slightly older Queen Anne and Italianate houses.

Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer Movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.

This battery wore an unusual naval uniform until it adopted the regulation garrison artillery uniform in 1872. The battery was disbanded in 1876 after a shooting competition at Hastings, when the men refused their captain's orders to march back to Rye and instead caught the train. The 4th (Hastings) Corps also had a Cadet Corps affiliated to it from March 1864 to 1868.Westlake, p. 48.

In 1866 the unit won the Queen's Prize at the annual National Artillery Association competition held at Shoeburyness.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 189. In 1870 the corps in the 1st Admin Brigade were numbered consecutively as 1st to 9th Cinque Ports AVCs (in most cases reverting to the numbering of May‚ÄìAugust 1860). On 16 March 1880 the Admin Brigade was consolidated as the 1st Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers, organised as follows: 1st Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers * HQ at Dover * Nos 1 and 2 Batteries at Dover ‚Äì from former 1st Corps * No 3 Battery at Folkestone ‚Äì from former 2nd Corps * Nos 4 and 5 Batteries at Ramsgate ‚Äì from former 3rd Corps * No 6 Battery at Sandwich ‚Äì from former 4th Corps * No 7 Battery at Deal ‚Äì from former 5th Corps * Nos 8, 9 and 10 Batteries at Hastings ‚Äì from former 6th Corps * No 11 Battery at St Leonards ‚Äì from former 7th Corps * No 12 Battery and a half battery at Margate ‚Äì from former 8th Corps * No 13 Battery at Ninfield ‚Äì from former 9th Corps * No 14 Battery at Pevensey ‚Äì from former 9th Corps The unit was later reduced to 13 batteries, and in April 1882 was assigned to the Cinque Ports Division of the Royal Artillery (RA). It was briefly (May 1887 to July 1889) designated the 4th Volunteer (Cinque Ports) Brigade, but reverted to its previous title and joined the Eastern Division, RA. On 1 April 1890 the Sussex batteries were separated to form the 2nd Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers, leaving the 1st with the Kent batteries. As well as manning fixed coast defence artillery, some of the early Artillery Volunteers manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. But the War Office refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns for Volunteers and they had largely died out in the 1870s. In 1888 the 'position artillery' concept was revived and some Volunteer companies were reorganised as position batteries to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. On 14 July 1892 the 1st Cinque Ports AVs were reorganised as 1 position battery and 7 garrison companies:Beckett, p. 178.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 6. 1st Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers * No 1 Battery at Ramsgate * Nos 2 and 3 Companies at Dover * No 4 Company at Folkestone * Nos 5 and 8 Companies at Sandwich * No 6 Company at Deal * No 7 Company at Margate In 1902 the divisional organisation was abolished for the artillery, and the unit was assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) as 1st Cinque Ports RGA (Volunteers) with a ninth company. Territorial Force 15-pounder gun. When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Cinque Ports RGA was transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), initially as the I (or 1st) Home Counties Brigade, then from 1910 as the III (or 3rd) Home Counties (Cinque Ports) Brigade with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 676.London Gazette 20 March 1908.Litchfield, p. 106.Kent at Great War Centenary Drill Halls.

The unit was assigned to the Home Counties Division of the TF.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49‚Äì54.44 Div at Long, Long Trail.44 Div at Regimental Warpath World War I =Mobilisation= On the outbreak of war, units of the Territorial Force were mobilised for home defence and then invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. Duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way the 1/III and 2/III Home Counties (Cinque Ports) Brigades were formed.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75‚Äì82.67 Div at Long, Long Trail. =1/III Home Counties (Cinque Ports) Brigade= India The bulk of the Home Counties Division, including the 1/III Home Counties Brigade without its Brigade Ammunition Column, embarked at Southampton and sailed on 30 October 1914 to India to relieve Regular Army units to fight on the Western Front. The Territorials disembarked at Bombay 1‚Äì3 December, and were allotted to various peacetime stations across India (although the Home Counties Division remained in the order of battle and received a number as the 44th (Home Counties) Division in May 1915, it never served as a complete formation in the war). The 1/III Home Counties Bde went to Jubbulpore where it joined the 5th (Mhow) Division.Perry, pp. 67‚Äì71. Mesopotamia 18-pounder in action in Mesopotamia. The Territorials completed their training in India to prepare them for possible active service, and supplied drafts to units serving in the Mesopotamian campaign. The 2nd Kent Bty moved to Lucknow in June 1915. In 1916 the Home Counties artillery was finally re-equipped with the modern 18-pounder gun. The 1/III Home Counties Bde then left Jubbulpore and sailed to Basra, where it landed on 21 May to reinforce the forces fighting in Mesopotamia.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, pp. 238‚Äì41. The 2nd Kent Bty from Lucknow joined the newly formed 15th Indian Division on the Euphrates front in July and on 11 September the division took part in the action of As Sahilan. In October the whole brigade was assigned to the 15th Indian Division. Shortly afterwards the brigade was renumbered as CCXXII Brigade (222nd Bde) and the batteries became A, B and C.Frederick, p. 688.Perry, pp. 134‚Äì5. In September 1917 the brigade's batteries received numbers as 1070, 1071 and 1072, then rearranged to form two 6-gun batteries, numbered 1070 and 1072. The brigade was joined by 375 and 77 (Howitzer) Btys to bring it up to the new establishment of three 18-pounder batteries and one of 4.5-inch howitzers. 375 Battery was a new six-gun battery formed in 64th (2nd Highland) Division's billeting area round Norwich in December 1916Army Council Instruction 2403 of 22 December 1916 and then shipped to Mesopotamia. 77 (H) Battery was a regular RFA unit that had been stationed at Meerut in India as part of VI (H) Bde RFA at the outbreak of war and then served in the 5th (Mhow) Division. It was replaced by 429 (H) Bty in October 1918. The brigade then had the following organisation for the remainder of the war:Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 262‚Äì4. 4.5-inch howitzer at the Royal Artillery Museum. CCXXII Brigade, RFA * 77 (H) Battery (4 x 4.5-inch howitzers) ‚Äì until October 1918 * 375 Battery (6 x 18-pounders) * 429 (H) Battery (4 x 4.5-inch howitzers) ‚Äì from October 1918 * 1070 Battery (6 x 18-pounders) * 1072 Battery (6 x 18-pounders) Ramadi In September 1917, 15th Indian Division, which had been in reserve round Baghdad, was ordered to capture Ramadi. 222nd Brigade started from Fallujah and joined the concentration at Madhij on 26 September. The plan was to feint along the Euphrates towards Horseshoe Lake, and then attack Mushaid Ridge. The guns were in position by 00.30 on 28 September, and opened fire at 05.30. The infantry quickly seized the ridge. Next the division moved on Ramadi and on Aziziya Ridge. 90th Punjabis and 2/39th Garhwal Rifles of 12th Indian Brigade, supported by rapid fire from 222nd Bde, captured Aziziya Ridge, cutting off the Turks in Ramadi, who surrendered the following day.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 264‚Äì6.Moberley, Vol IV, pp. 50‚Äì9. Khan Baghdadi There was then a pause in the campaign as reinforcements had to be sent from Mesoptoamia to other fronts, but 15th Division resumed its advance in March 1918, seizing Hƒ´t (9 March) and pressing on towards Khan Baghdadi. The Turks had three trench systems (known as P, Q and R) around Baghdadi, and the leading troops (50th Indian Brigade) began their advance towards them at 21.00 on 25 March. 42nd Indian Brigade, supported by two batteries of 222nd Bde and a siege battery, set off at midnight. A mobile column, consisting of 2/39th Garwhalis, 1072 Bty, and a light armoured motor battery, stood ready to exploit any success. At 03.15 on 26 March, 50th and 42nd Bdes began a two-pronged attack on the strongly-held P trenches, with the supporting artillery concentrated on them. As the infantry closed theTurks began to retreat and the divisional commander ordered a general advance. The P trenches were captured by 11.30 and at 13.05 the mobile column was ordered forward. Now 222nd Bde advanced by alternate batteries across rough ground under enemy artillery fire.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 270‚Äì2.Moberley, Vol IV, pp. 121‚Äì8. The second phase of the attack began at 17.30 with 15 minutes of slow bombardment followed by 15 minutes of intense fire. The guns had worked their way forwards to between 1800 and 2200 yards (1650‚Äì2000 metres) of the enemy positions and spotter aircraft were active, so the fire was very accurate. The infantry got into the R trenches with few casualties. The artillery kept up continuous fire during the night while the cavalry worked their way round behind the Turks and the mobile column raced for Haditha.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 272. At 06.30 on 27 March a general pursuit was ordered: 'The gallant 1072nd Battery, RFA, of the Mobile Column, now double-horsed, strained forward keeping up with the Hertfordshire Yeomanry and 10th Lancers in true horse artillery style'. By last light the cavalry had reached Ana, and 1072 Bty had kept up with them. Thousands of prisoners were taken, and the Royal Artillery's historian describes the action as 'a magnificent feat, a true cavalry action, excellent cooperation between cavalry, artillery and infantry and fine leadership'.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 275.Moberley, Vol IV, pp. 128‚Äì35. After the end of the war the 15th Indian Division was quickly run down as its men returned home, and was formally disbanded in March 1919. =2/III Home Counties (Cinque Ports) Brigade= De Bange 90 mm French field gun issued to 2nd Line batteries. Because the 1st Home Counties Division had gone to India, the 2nd Home Counties Division was among the earliest 2nd Line formations to be formed. By 27 November 1914 the division was settled in billets round Windsor, Berkshire and was reported ready to receive its weapons. However, the only guns available for the RFA brigades were obsolete French 90 mm guns, and even then there were only 4 guns per brigade. It was not until January 1916 that the division's gunners received their modern 18-pounders, and even then some time elapsed before sights were received.Becke, Pt 2b, Appendix 3, p. 136. Meanwhile, the division had been numbered as 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division and given a dual role of training drafts for units serving overseas and at the same time being part of the mobile force responsible for home defence. From November 1915 it formed part of Second Army, Central Force, quartered in Kent. Twice the division was warned to prepare for moves to Ireland, and in April 1917 to deploy to France, but these moves never happened and the division remained in England for the whole war. In May 1916 the field brigades were numbered, with 2/III Home Counties becoming CCCXXXVII Brigade (337 Bde) and the batteries were designated A, B and C. In 1917 the batteries were brought up to a strength of six guns and a howitzer battery added when CCCXXXV (formerly 2/I Home Counties) Bde was broken up; D (H) Bty had originally been part of CCCXXXVIII (2/IV Home Counties) Bde. Tigris The brigade left 67th Division on 9 November 1917 and went to Mesopotamia, where it joined the newly formed 18th Indian Division at Baghdad by February 1918. 337th Brigade was completed by the addition of 341 (Howitzer) Bty and was under the command of Lt-Col M.C.J. Hartland‚ÄìMahon.Perry, pp. 147‚Äì50.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 287.Moberley, Vol IV, Appendix XLIII, p. 357.Wilson-Johnston, p. 1; 'Part II: Roll of Officers', p. 52. At the beginning of March 1918 the division began moving up the Tigris to join I Indian Corps, and 337th Bde went to Samarra with 55th Indian Brigade. The force made a demonstration beyond Samarra, but then returned to the town, which became the divisional HQ through the hot summer months.Moberley, Vol IV, Appendix XLV, p. 368; Appendix XLVI, p. 384.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 4‚Äì11. By October 1918 the Turks were in retreat in Palestine and on the Euphrates Front in Mesopotamia, and it was time for the forces on the parallel Tigris Front to exert pressure by advancing on Mosul. 18th Indian Division began its advance up the east bank of the Tigris to the British railhead of Tikrit and was concentrated there by 18 October. The problem was the strong Turkish position on the Little Zab river and the Fat-Ha gorge, 35 miles further on. Rather than make a direct assault with the untried 18th Indian Division, the British Corps commander, Lt-Gen Sir Alexander Cobbe, VC, chose to outflank the gorge with a mobile column.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, pp. 280‚Äì1.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 18‚Äì24. Covered by the 55th Indian Bde, 337th Bde moved into position during the night of 22/23 October and by morning was within a mile of the Fat-Ha trenches, registering guns on its targets. Advancing after dark, the infantry found the outflanked trenches abandoned, and 53rd Indian Brigade passed through the gorge, followed by 337th Bde, despite the appalling terrain for hauling guns. By 11.15 the following day the division had reached Tell-ad-Dhahab, and cavalry patrols were across the Little Zab. Next day, 25 October, the advance continued, with 53rd Indian Bde and C/337 Bty reaching the Shumait Ford early in the morning, followed by the rest of the artillery. By noon the three field batteries of 337th Bde were in action, in the open in full view of the enemy but with magnificent observation posts (OPs) on a nearby hill. 341 (H) Battery reached the Tigris‚ÄìLittle Zab junction and came into action at close range, but was suddenly hit by accurate Turkish shellfire, losing all but two guns, most of its wagons and several men. However, its action allowed C/337 Bty to come into action a couple of miles away undisturbed, and for more of the corps artillery to close up and support the infantry crossing.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, pp. 281‚Äì2.Wilson- Johnston, pp. 20‚Äì28. By 12.30 the following day 337th Bde was across the Little Zab and engaging enemy guns. Once again the position was outflanked by the mobile column, and early on 27 October patrols found the Turkish trenches empty. 53rd Indian Brigade, with A/337 Bty and the surviving section of 341 (H) Bty, was ordered forward to take up position opposite Sharqat on the west bank of the Tigris, later joined by C/337 Bty. At dawn on 28 October the Battle of Sharqat opened, with the guns on the east bank firing across the river, A/337 Bty later crossing the Tigris by a ford and galloping up to join in. The following morning C/337 Bty also crossed to the west bank where an afternoon attack made good progress, A/337 Bty supporting a charge by the 13th Hussars. The force on the west bank was about to attack Sharqat on the morning of 30 October, when the Turks in the town surrendered.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, pp. 283‚Äì5.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 28‚Äì34. The commander of 18th Indian Division, Maj-Gen Hew Fanshawe, was immediately sent on with a mobile column including A/337 Bty to destroy the remaining Turkish forces and capture Mosul. The column forded the Tigris, with artillery horses assisting the mule carts, and pushed on to the city which fell without a fight after news arrived of the signing of the Armistice of Mudros and the end of hostilities on 31 October.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, p. 285.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 36‚Äì9. At the end of the war 18th Indian Division was selected to form part of the occupation force in Iraq and served during the Iraq Rebellion of 1920 before being broken up in 1921. Interwar =59th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) Brigade= The 3rd Home Counties Brigade (now with 1st to 4th Kent Batteries) reformed on 7 February 1920. When the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army in 1921 it was designated the 59th (Home Counties) Brigade, RFA, with the second subtitle 'Cinque Ports' added the following year:Frederick, p. 517.Titles & Designations, 1927. 59th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) Brigade, RFA * HQ at Drill Hall, Liverpool Street, Dover * 233 (Kent) Battery at Dover * 234 (Kent) Battery (Howitzer) at Shallon Street, Folkestone * 235 (Kent) Battery at Victoria Road, Margate * 236 (Kent) Battery at Grove Terrace, Deal (to Ramsgate in 1938) Its CO on re-formation was Brevet Lt-Col the Hon Hugh Scarlett, DSO. One of the officers was Major John Morley Stebbings, who as a young officer had won the Edward Medal leading a rescue party of eight men from his battery into the ruins of the Uplees explosives factory near Faversham after the Great Explosion on 2 April 1916. He had subsequently won a Military Cross (MC) on the Western Front.London Gazette, 22 January 1918.Sale of Stebbings' medals at auction 17 May 2016.Sale of Cpl Ashley's medals at auction 13 December 2007. 1st Battalion The Buffs Cadet Corps was attached to the unit. The brigade was once again assigned as divisional artillery to 44th (Home Counties) Division. On 1 June 1924 the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery and its brigades redesignated Field Brigades, RA.Litchfield, Appendix IV. =75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) AA Regiment= In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA units to the AA role. 59th Field Brigade was one of these. First, in February 1938, the howitzer battery (234) at Folkestone was detached to become 223 (Cinque Ports) Independent AA Battery; the numbering of the other batteries was changed, so that 236 Bty at Deal took the number 234. Then on 1 November 1938 the rest of the brigade was converted, becoming 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) Anti-Aircraft Brigade under the command of Lt-Col Stebbings, and 223 Bty rejoined. The RA's AA 'brigades' were redesignated 'regiments' on 1 January 1939.Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì60, 774. With the expansion of the TA after the Munich Crisis, most units split to form duplicates. In the case of 75th, the CO, Lt-Col Stebbings, left with 234th and 235th Batteries on 1 April 1939 to form a new 89th (Cinque Ports) AA Regiment. The second-in-command, Major N.V. Sadler, was promoted to command the 75th AA Rgt and a new battery was raised at Ashford to give the following organisation:89 HAA Rgt War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2380. 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) AA Regiment * HQ at Drill Hall, Liverpool St, Dover * 223 (Cinque Ports) AA Bty at Shallon St, Folkestone * 233 (Kent) AA Bty at Drill Hall, Liverpool St, Dover * 306 AA Bty at Ashford Both new regiments were under the command of 28th (Thames & Medway) AA Brigade in 6th AA Division of Anti-Aircraft Command.AA Command on 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. World War II =Mobilisation= In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun positions. Full mobilisation of AA Command came in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September 1939.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 306 AA Battery joined 89th HAA Rgt on 30 August, and then departed for training, returning to 75th HAA Rgt in May 1940. From 1 June 1940 those AA units armed with 3-inch or the more modern 3.7-inch guns were termed 'Heavy AA' (HAA) to distinguish them for the Light AA units then being formed. =Battle of Britain= 3.7-inch guns of 75th HAA Regiment at Dover, 1940. The Luftwaffe began its bombing offensive against the British mainland with small-scale raids on coastal targets, then in July 1940 began heavy daylight raids against south coast ports and shipping: the guns at Dover were in action virtually every day. 205 Battery temporarily rejoined from 89th HAA Rgt to boost the numbers of guns at Dover. Lieutenant-Colonel N.V. Sadler of 75th HAA Rgt developed an effective system of HAA barrages over individual points in Dover Harbour and the shipping channels, underpinned by LAA fire. In one day the regiment shot down seven Junkers Ju 87 'Stukas' together with two Messerschmitt Bf 109s and a Dornier Do 215.Collier Appendix XXIIIRoutledge, pp. 381‚Äì6. Sadler, who had won a Distinguished Conduct Medal in the ranks during World War I, was commissioned into 59th Field Bde between the wars. At the end of 1940 he was promoted to Brigadier and sent to Malta as AA Defence Commander during the Siege.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 169.Routledge, p. 167. 28th AA Brigade had responsibility for the 'Thames South' defences as well as Dover, and at times part of 75th HAA Rgt was transferred to 37th AA Bde responsible for 'Thames North' on the Essex bank of the Thames Estuary. These concentrations of HAA guns were in frequent action by day and night during the Battle of Britain and early part of The Blitz as Luftwaffe bombers came up the estuary to target London, Chatham, and the docks along the river.75 HAA Rgt at RA 1949‚Äì45.Routledge, pp. 387‚Äì95; Table LXV, p. 396. =Blitz= On 24 November 1940, as the night-bombing 'Blitz' against British cities got under way, the regiment was shifted to strengthen the defences in Northern England, joining 62nd AA Bde in 10th AA Division, covering Leeds and Sheffield with one battery detached to Derby.10 AA Division at RA 1939‚Äì45.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D. The regiment sent a cadre of experienced officers and other ranks to 211th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry to provide the basis for a new 422 HAA Bty; this was formed on 10 April 1941 and joined the regiment on 7 July. The regiment sent another cadre to 206th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield for 463 HAA Bty; this was formed on 7 August 1941 and later joined 133rd HAA Rgt. The regiment sent a final cadre to 207th HAA Training Rgt at Devizes for 542 (Mixed) HAA Bty, formed on 5 March 1942, which joined 159th (Mixed) HAA Rgt ('Mixed' units were those in which women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated). During the summer of 1941 the regiment moved back to 37th AA Bde in 6th AA Division. The brigade was being reorganised, and for a while in the winter of 1941-42 the 75th was the only unit under its command. 422 Bty was sometimes detached to 28th AA Bde in 'Thames South', and on 30 March 1942 it was permanently transferred to 127th HAA Rgt in that formation, leaving 75th HAA Rgt with the three-battery establishment required for overseas service. Later that month, 75th HAA Rgt left Anti-Aircraft Command in preparation for going overseas.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. =Iraq= The regiment left the UK in August 1942 and joined GHQ Persia and Iraq Command (PAIFORCE) in Iraq in October. The role of PAIFORCE was to protect the vital oilfields of the Middle East against a potential German incursion through the Caucasus. The AA units had to cover oil installations, ports, rail lines and airfields, for which 75th HAA Rgt was placed under the command of the newly reconstituted 4th AA Brigade. In the event the Luftwaffe was never able to penetrate Iraq from its airfields in Russia, and PAIFORCE had a quiet war. As the Germans were pushed back on the Eastern Front there was a general run-down of British forces in PAIFORCE, but 75th HAA Rgt remained until May 1944, when it moved to Middle East Command with 4th AA Bde.Joslen, p. 488.Routledge, pp. 198‚Äì200, Table XXXIII, p. 211. 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt with its three batteries (223, 233 and 306) was placed in suspended animation on 11 July 1944. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 75th HAA Rgt was reformed as 259 (Mobile) HAA Rgt (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports), RA.Frederick, p. 998.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.235‚Äì265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.The regiment came under the command of 53rd AA Brigade (the former 27th (Home Counties) AA Bde) based at Dover, part of 1 AA Group. Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. AA Command was disbanded on 1 March 1955 and there was a major reduction in AA units. 259 (Mobile) HAA Rgt was placed in suspended animation, and the following year merged with part of 11th AA (Mixed) Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals (the signal unit for 1 AA Group). The merged unit was designated Home Counties District (Mixed) Signal Regiment with HQ at Shorncliffe. ('Mixed' indicated that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit.) The unit became 62 (Mixed) Signal Regiment in 1959, regained its 'Cinque Ports' subtitle in 1960, and merged with 44 (Home Counties) Signal Regiment in 1961. In 1967 the merged unit became 44 (Cinque Ports) Signal Squadron in 36 (Eastern) Signal Regiment, which was reduced to 844 Cinque Ports Signal Troop in 2010.Nalder, pp. 598, 618‚Äì9. Uniforms and Insignia The full dress of the original artillery volunteers was based on that of the RA, but for ordinary parade the men wore a loose undress tunic and trousers of blue Baize. The 4th Battery of the 6th (Hastings) AVC, however, wore a naval uniform with sailors' caps until 1872. The badge of the Cinque Ports artillery volunteers was the Coat of arms of the Cinque Ports surrounded by a circlet. On officers' pouches the circlet carried the motto 'PRO ARIS ET FOCIS' (For hearth and home); on later tunic buttons and belt clasps shared with the rifle volunteers the circlet was inscribed 'CINQUE PORTS VOLUNTEERS'. From 1953 to 1955, 259 HAA Rgt wore an embroidered arm badge with 'CINQUE PORTS' beneath 'ROYAL ARTILLERY' in red on a navy blue backing. Honorary Colonels The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * 2nd Earl Granville, KG, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, appointed 23 April 1866 * Edward Vernon Harcourt, former CO, appointed 7 August 1872 * Lord Northbourne, appointed 10 August 1898 * Col F.G.

In New York City, twelve protesters were arrested for civil disobedience after blocking the entrance to the Manhattan JPMorgan building. In Oakland, California, four people were arrested for trespassing at an Alameda County government building. In Denver, a rally began in the city's Civic Center Park before a vigil occurred outside of a for-profit detention center in Aurora owned by GEO Group, which at the time was the second-largest operator of for-profit prisons and facing lawsuits representing 62,000 of their detainees for being threatened with solitary confinement. The protests in Olympia, Washington and Portland, Oregon turned violent and were classified as riots by police. In Portland, protesters allegedly threw lead balls, smoke bombs, paint, glass bottles, and cans of Pepsi at officers. There were multiple cases of property damage and arson. This resulted in 25 arrests and the cancellation of the protest permit. In Olympia, black-clad protesters shattered windows, and threw smoke-issuing devices and rocks at police.

The crime The three boys, aged 12, 13, and 14, were ordered into a police car by the six officers in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley. Each boy was driven in a separate patrol car to a swampy area in Pinkenba, Queensland. The officers threatened to throw the boys into the swampy wasteland, and referred to a place where people's fingers were cut off, in order to get them to comply with their demands. The boys were abandoned after their shoes were removed. The boys later retrieved their shoes and began to walk home. They finished the journey in a taxi paid for by a security guard they met along the way. Outcome Police later admitted that the boys had not previously committed any crimes but were taken to deter them from committing any crimes or being a public nuisance. Following an investigation by the Criminal Justice Commission, the Public Prosecutor laid charges against the police for deprivation of liberty. The charges were later dropped after a magistrate found the boys agreed to go with the police officers, but the police officers were put on probation for one year by the police service, not as a court sentence.

Through a programme of outdoor activities, parades and sports, the organization aimed to indoctrinate its members in the tenets of Nazi ideology. Membership became compulsory in 1939. By the end of World War II, some had become child soldiers. After the war, both the Jungvolk and its parent organization ceased to exist. The Nazi Party (NSDAP) directed propaganda at children in Nazi Germany between the 1920s and 1945 to influence the values and beliefs of the future generation of German citizens according to their political agenda and ideology. The Nazi Party targeted children with mandatory youth organizations, school courses on racial purity, and anti-Semitic children‚Äôs books. The Nazi Party's propaganda took advantage of children's ignorance about the Jewish community. Although the Jewish population in Germany was the largest in central Europe, it was still a relatively small fraction of the overall population, with only 525,000 members (0.75% of the total German population).  Youth organizations  A German family 1943 with 12 children, all dressed in Nazi Party or military uniforms. The mother is decorated with the Cross of Honor of the German Mother. Photo: Bundesarchiv Starting in the 1920s, the Nazi Party \\"targeted German youth as a special audience for its propaganda messages\\". They encouraged the formation of Nazi youth groups for children who were \\"dynamic, resilient, forward-looking, and hopeful.\\" As the Nazi Party grew, the number of children they targeted increased. By 1936, \\"membership in Nazi youth groups became mandatory for all boys and girls between the ages of 10-17.\\" The Hitler Youth organization was founded in 1926 to train young boys for membership in the Sturmabteilung (SA; literally Storm Detachment), the Party's main paramilitary organization at the time. In 1933, leaders of the Hitler Youth decided to integrate boys into the Nazi national community and prepare them for service as soldiers in the Schutzstaffel (SS, also stylized as Runic \\"·õã·õã\\"). Membership of the Hitler Youth skyrocketed from 50,000 in January 1933 to more than 2 million by the end of the year. Before membership became mandatory in 1939, the group had surpassed 5.4 million members, with over 700,000 German youths holding leadership positions. Once membership in the Hitler Youth organization had become mandatory, \\"German authorities ... prohibited or dissolved competing youth organizations\\". The Nazi Party used the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls as the primary tools to shape the minds of the German youth and create the illusion of a mass community that reached \\"across class and religious divisions that characterized Germany before 1933\\".

Photo: Bundesarchiv When boys reached age 18, they were required to enlist in the armed forces or into the Reich Labour Service and \\"were put through three weeks of the most rigorous training. The need for discipline and unquestioning obedience was drilled into the boys.\\" Girls, on the other hand, were sent to Poland to help German farmers cultivate the land that had been seized from the Poles during the course of World War II. They were required to work long hours helping inexperienced farmers work the fields, and they were also forced to act as nursemaids for the sick. In addition to this work, they had the responsibility of overseeing that the \\"Nazi rules and doctrine were not violated\\". From 1943 to 1944, as Allied forces crossed the borders into Germany, the demands on the Hitler Youth intensified. German youths aged 16 were enlisted for active duty. Often these new soldiers fought in units alongside seniors who were over the age of sixty in the national militia (Volkssturm, literally People's Storm). As the war continued to turn in the Allied force's favor, the Nazi Party became desperate and began training boys as young as ten to handle and operate military-grade weaponry (machine guns, hand grenades, bazookas, etc.). Hitler Youth tank divisions were formed to fight in the Battle of the Bulge; the number of casualties rose steeply as \\"barely trained fifteen-year-olds [were] led by sixteen-year-olds\\".  Propaganda through schools  German school children 1934 celebrating Day of the founding of the German Empire with Nazi salutes. Photo: Bundesarchiv Soon after the Enabling Act of 1933 had been passed, Jewish teachers and professors were dismissed from German schools and universities. By April 1933, there were no Jewish teachers remaining in schools attended by 'Aryan' students, a racial term used by the Nazis to describe the Germanic peoples. In the educational system, Jewish children regularly experienced ridicule, from both their peers and teachers. For example, Jewish children would be sent to the back of the classroom to reiterate to the non-Jewish German children the notion that they were inferior to them. Additionally, \\"teachers would begin to pick out Jewish students in classrooms to use as examples during biology lessons about racial impurity. Jewish children would be told to stand at the front of the class, whilst teachers pointed to their eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and hair, comparing these to characteristics on Nazi propaganda sheets\\". Eventually, the Jewish children were completely segregated from the non-Jewish German children in schools. During the period of segregation, Jewish teachers were allowed to set up separate schools for Jewish students. This came, however, with its own set of issues for Jewish children, who were frequently beaten up and attacked by members of the Hitler Youth who \\"would wait outside at the end of the school day and set about beating Jewish boys as they left school\\". In 1938, Jewish children were banned from receiving education completely and were removed from schools prior to being sent to concentration camps. From this point onward, schools heavily used propaganda to indoctrinate children into Nazi ideology. Textbooks and posters were used to teach German youth \\"the importance of racial consciousness\\". Students' school work was often provided in an ideological context. The following math problem is an example: \\"The Jews are aliens in Germany. In 1933, there were 66,000,000 people living in Germany. Of this total, 499,862 were Jewish. What is the percentage of aliens in Germany?\\" Textbook passages like this consistently reiterated the message of the racial inferiority of Jews, as well as the superiority of the German peoples they called the Aryan race. With the dismissal of Jewish educators, the National Socialist Teachers League required that only teachers who could prove they were \\"Aryan\\" were teaching the German youth. Every educator \\"was required to submit an ancestry table in triplicate with official documented proof\\" of their lineage. In addition, the league monitored courses for compliance with the Nazi Party's values. All educational courses had to reflect the aims of Hitler; of the required courses, they believed the most important was to teach German children racial theory and, by extension, the Jewish problem. By 1936, 97% of German educators belonged to the National Socialist Teachers League. Children's books from the Third Reich era: Hermine Morgenroth and Maria Schmidt: Kinder, was wisst Ihr vom F√ºhrer? (\\"Children, what do you know about the F√ºhrer?\\", 1933); Karl K√∂ster: Die Fahnen wehen! (\\"The banners are waving!\\", 1935); Helga Knoepke-Joest: Ulla, ein Hitlerm√§del (\\"Ulla, a Hitler girl\\" 1933). Exhibits in the Lofoten War Memorial Museum, Norway. Children's books were created throughout the Nazi's reign to incite hatred for Jews at a young age. These books contained demeaning illustrations of Jewish people; in these books, Jewish people were depicted as \\"usually stocky ... the posture is crooked or bent; the feet are flat; the hair is dark; there is a lot of coarse body hair. The face usually has dark and bulging eyes, a crooked or bent nose, hanging eyelids, a hanging underlip, and a heavy beard.\\" Furthermore, books such as Trau Keinem Fuchs auf gr√ºner Heid und keinem Jud aufi seinem Eid (in English, Trust No Fox on his Green Meadow and No Jew on his Oath), written by Elvira Bauer, aimed to reiterate to German children that the war \\"was being fought to save the Aryan world from the Jewish alien invaders within the midst\\". These books were distributed in schools with the sole purpose of teaching children Nazi ideologies. Additionally, after-school activities and weekend trips were regularly sponsored by the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls. These activities often acted as recruitment meetings for the participating school children. The Hitler Youth combined sports and physical outdoor activities with Nazi ideologies. Likewise, the League of German Girls emphasized collective athletics such as rhythmic gymnastics, which \\"German health authorities deemed less strenuous to the female body and better geared to preparing them for motherhood\\". This was also used for public display. Authorities wanted these sports and activities to encourage \\"young men and women to abandon their individuality in favor of the goals of the Aryan collective\\".

The ceremony is conducted by members of the SS as a \\"Nazi cult ritual\\". Photo: Bundesarchiv Hitler's ideologies were taught to the entire population of German children. These children were instructed in Nazi ideology from a very young age, and through this and mandatory membership in the youth organizations, children were taught to hate Jews. The youth of Nazi Germany came of age in the 1920s, 1930s, and early 1940s listening to racist and anti- Semitic lectures, reciting Nazi-inspired slogans, reading propaganda publications, and attending national youth rallies. The affected children were instructed to report any activities or conversations that could be considered treacherous. Children reported the activity of neighbors, teachers, religious leaders, and even their own family. Through these means, the youth of Germany were taught to respect, follow, and embrace the ideologies of the Nazi Party and those espoused by Hitler. The effect of propaganda on children would last for years after World War II ended. During the end of the war in Canada members of Hitler Youth members of Werwolf could be heard singing \\"Heute gehoert uns Deutschland und morgen die ganze Welt\\" (Today Germany belongs to us, and tomorrow the whole world). Even after the unconditional surrender of the German forces, many German youths continued to fight on behalf of the Nazi Party in Werwolf. The young members of Werwolf strongly believed that they were fighting for a just cause, and they felt disillusioned after the end of the war. In the ensuing years, Allied occupation authorities required German youths to undergo denazification programs that were designed to counter the adverse effects of the Nazi propaganda.

She is best known for her portrait paintings. Her choices of subjects look to enlarge the genre of American art historical realism by telling African-American stories within their own tradition. She is well known for using grisaille to portray skin tones in her work as a way of \\"challenging the concept of color-as-race.\\" Her style is simplified realism, involving staged photographs of her subjects. Sherald is the first African-American to paint an official First Lady portrait. Her portrait of First Lady Michelle Obama was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC on February 12, 2018.  Early life  Sherald was born on August 30, 1973 in Columbus, Georgia to dentist Amos P. Sherald III and Geraldine W. Sherald. As a child, her parents wanted her career to be in medicine, and discouraged her from pursuing art. Speaking about how her mother's discouragement had increased her determination, Sherald told The Cut: > My mother did not want me to become an artist. She was a black woman born in > 1930s Alabama where everything was really about surviving. I always say that > she was the perfect mother for me, because what I needed was somebody to > prove wrong. I‚Äôm a strong woman because I was raised by one, and I‚Äôm a > better person for that. Despite being Interested in art from a young age, Sherald recalls not realizing it could be a profession until around the age of eight upon visiting a museum for the first time. She recalls how important it was to see artwork in a museum, saying, > What was so shocking when I first went to a museum, was to find out that art > wasn't something in a book, in an encyclopedia, that people did [art] a long > time ago, that it was real life. And then, when I saw an image of a person > of color, it all came together in that moment-that this was something real, > that somebody created this who was alive at the same time that I was alive. Education Sherald received a B.A. degree in painting in 1997 Clark Atlanta University. After an apprenticeship with Arturo Lindsay, an art history professor at Spelman College, she attended the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), receiving an M.F.A. degree in painting in 2004. While attending MICA, Sherald studied with abstract expressionist painter Grace Hartigan, from whom she learned the \\"dripping method\\" of painting. She later followed up her studies with painter Odd Nerdrum in Larvik, Norway. Career Equilibrium mural by Amy Sherald in Baltimore Sherald is based in Baltimore, and documents contemporary African-American experience in the United States through large- scale portraits, often working from photographs of strangers she encounters on the streets. This approach is evocative of the late Barkley L. Hendricks. In 1997, Sherald participated in Spelman College International Artist-in- Residence program in Portobelo, Panama. She prepared and curated shows in the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo and the 1999 South American Biennale in Lima, Peru. She has taught art in the Baltimore City Detention Center, and in 2008 she did a residency the Tongxian Art Center in Beijing, China. She first came to prominence in 2016 when her painting, Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance), won the National Portrait Gallery's Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The competition noted that \\"Sherald creates innovative, dynamic portraits that, through color and form, confront the psychological effects of stereotypical imagery on African-American subjects\\". She was the first woman and first African-American to win the competition. In 2018, Equilibrium was installed on the wall of the Parkway Theatre located in Baltimore. The project was funded through the 2014 Transformative Art Prize grant, an initiative that installs public artworks in underused public places in Baltimore. The original painting is in the permanent collection of the Embassy of the United States, Dakar, Senegal. Sherald's solo exhibition, titled \\"the heart of the matter...\\" took place in fall 2019 at the Hauser & Wirth gallery in New York City. The exhibition featured eight, large scale oil portraits. Writing on the same issue, Erin Christovale, an associate curator at the Hammer Museum noted that ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about the grayness that doesn‚Äôt mute the paintings but allows you to really think about the various skin tones and cultures and spaces that the African diaspora exists in.\\" = First Lady Portrait = Michelle Obama by Amy Sherald The year after Sherald won the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, she was chosen by First Lady Michelle Obama to paint her official portrait. On February 12, 2018 the National Portrait Gallery unveiled the portrait, making Sherald the first African-American to paint an official First Lady portrait. The double portrait unveiling ceremony was attended by Barack and Michelle Obama. It was noted that Sherald and Kehinde Wiley, the painter of Barack Obama's portrait, were the first African-American artists to make official presidential portraits at the National Portrait Gallery, and also as artists who each early on prioritized African-American portraiture. Holland Cotter noted in a review that they both blend fact and fiction in their portraiture. Sherald's portrait of Obama drew high numbers of visitors to the National Portrait Gallery. In response to criticism about the painting, such as, \\"Why is she gray?‚Äô...It doesn‚Äôt look like her,\\" she summarized her responses by saying ‚ÄúSome people like their poetry to rhyme. Some people don‚Äôt.‚Äù With the reveal of Michelle Obama's portrait, there were many criticisms with how it was viewed since it was less formal as many had expected. The portrait itself has hidden \\"personal and societal meaning behind them\\" that allows the audience to feel a connection when they see the portrait. The portrait was meant to show that people could relate to the former First Lady because of the simplicity of the portrait and how the depiction of her was meant to be seen as how others looked up to her. From the portrait, the former First Lady is seen gazing at the audience with deep thought. Amy Sherald painted the portrait in gray was because she was using her \\"signature grayscale\\" to show Michelle Obama's skin tone which can allude to being intentional. Sherald chose this to be intentional to give the viewer an incentive to view Obama simply in her entirety as a person rather than based solely on her racial identity. The choice of colors forces the viewer to look past her identity to see her in the way ‚Äúwomen can relate to‚Äîno matter what shape, size, race, or color. . . .‚Äù The portrait has a voice with a meaningful interpretation that moves others and learn about the history behind it. Personal life Sherald was diagnosed at the age of 30 with congestive heart failure. She was the recipient of a heart transplant in December 18, 2012 at the age of 39.

The charity enables serving prisoners and detainees to record bed time stories which can then be sent home to their children, and aims to maintain connections between serving prisoners and their families. In women's institutions the project operates under the name Storybook Mums. By 2019 the scheme was in place in about 100 British prisons, including women's prisons and has been adopted by members of the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy on active service abroad. The charity's headquarters is in HMP Channings Wood in Devon, and has inspired similar programmes in other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Hungary, Poland and New Zealand. History Berry began the project in 2002 while she was working at BBC Radio Devon and was visiting HMP Channings Wood to help set up a radio station within the prison with the prison's writer-in-residence. Berry then began working at HMP Dartmoor teaching further education in the prison education department where the idea grew from her working on recordings at home in her own time to setting up a registered charity. The scheme was initially difficult to set up because of restrictions on bringing recording equipment and storage cards into secure units. The project originally ran from an empty cell inside the prison but after a few years Berry and the volunteers were given an office in the prison education department which was officially opened by HRH Princess Anne in 2007. In 2010 Berry received an OBE for services to children and families. Storybook Dads aims to engage prisoners in maintaining contact with some of the 200,000 children who are affected each year by having a parent in prison. By 2019 Storybook Dads was reported as operating in around 100 prisons and reaching 20,000 children annually, and in 2017 it was reported 5000 families benefited from a Christmas period initiative. With the possible closure of HMP Dartmoor, in 2015 Storybook Dads moved to HMP Channings Wood with an increased staff of 18. Patrons of Storybook Dads are children's author Julia Donaldson and humanitarian and author Terry Waite. Storytelling The bookreading recording can be carried out by volunteers from the charity, library or education staff, members of the chaplaincy department, the Offender Management Unit or pact. Readers will read aloud from books and may use puppets or toys to animate the story. One prisoner at HMP Dartmoor explained \\"It‚Äôs really weird at first, sitting there reading a story to camera with a toy monkey on your shoulder.‚Äù Readings can be edited to remove mistakes or prompting help for people with reading difficulties, effects and music may also be added. Recordings were originally made on MiniDisc recorders. At HMP Channings Wood, where the charity is based, trained editors (from the prison population) then edit and convert these audio or video recordings onto CD and DVD. The recording is then sent to the child with a personal message. Some additional elements and adaptations to the process have been locally introduced. At HMP Lowdham Grange some prisoners have used the scheme to gain accreditation in video editing to increase job opportunities on release. At HM Prison Hollesley Bay prisoner and child can use activity sheets to support the reading on subjects such as 'memories' or 'hopes' which are then converted into a book, called Me and My Dad by the prisoner. In 2018 the Bedtime Stories programme, run by Stratford Literary Festival in conjunction with Storybook Mums and Dads, ran workshops to help inmates write stories for children which they then either sent or read and recorded to their children outside. Impact According to statistics gathered by the Learning and Work Institute, 95% of prisoners who took part and 92% of family respondents reported that the Storybook Dads project had improved the relationship with the child. At HMP Greenock a report produced by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education in Scotland indicated the scheme was of a high quality and that \\"Positive feedback from children had increased prisoners‚Äô self-esteem and presented them with an opportunity to reflect upon their parenting skills.\\" Research from King's College London in 2014 identified that while caution needs to be exercised in evaluating self-reported feedback, prisoners report increased creativity and children increased well-being. However the report identified methodological flaws because evaluating its impact relies on children's feedback being provided by the home carer who may not have a positive relationship with the prisoner, and no quantitative measurements of literacy or recidivism have been made. The Me and My Dad project aims to address some of these issues but has not yet been independently evaluated. The report also identified that there were positive benefits to reengaging prisoners with the education system and the programme, being privately funded, was not subject to the problems associated with budgetary cuts and competitive tendering. In 2012 Storybook Dads won an award for e-inclusion from the European Commission. In 2017 Liz Truss identified Storybook Dads in a discussion at the House of Commons as part of a reading of the Prisons and Courts Bill 2016-17, stating the importance of such charities in rehabilitating offenders and preventing reoffending. The Guardian questioned whether the new bill would lead to any practical opportunities of funding for such charities or whether they would be expected to continue to make up the deficit between government proposed rehabilition strategies and the actual prisoner's experience inside.

The territory of the province was principally made up of the two subordinate eastern Georgian kingdoms of Kartli () and Kakheti () and, briefly, parts of the Principality of Samtskhe. The city of Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi) was its administrative center, the base of Safavid power in the province, and the seat of the rulers of Kartli. It also housed an important Safavid mint. Safavid rule was mainly exercised through the approval or appointment of Georgian royals of the Bagrationi dynasty, at times converts to Shia Islam, as valis or khans. The eastern Georgian kingdoms had been subjected in the early 16th century, their rulers did not commonly convert. Tiflis was garrisoned by an Iranian force as early as IsmailI's reign, but relations between the Georgians and Safavids at the time mostly bore features of traditional vassalage. Davud Khan (David XI) was the first Safavid-appointed ruler, whose placement on the throne of Kartli in 1562 marked the start of nearly two and a half centuries of Iranian political control of eastern Georgia. During the same period, Iranian cultural influence dominated eastern Georgia. From Tahmasp I's reign onwards (), the province was of great strategic importance. Many ethnic Georgians, generally from Kartli and Kakheti, rose to prominence in the Safavid state. These men held many of the highest positions in the civil and military administration, and many women entered the harem of the ruling class. By the late Safavid period, Georgians formed the mainstay of the Safavid army as well. The establishment of a large Georgian community in Iran proper dates back to the era of Safavid suzerainty in Georgia. As the province was a border entity, the valis of Georgia exercised more autonomy than other provinces of the Safavid empire; it could therefore be compared to the Arabestan Province (present-day Khuzestan Province), in the southwestern part of the empire. The province of Georgia was one of only four Safavid administrative territories where governors were consistently given the title of vali. History =16th century= The first Safavid king (shah) Ismail I (1501‚Äì1524) made the two kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti his vassals as early as the 1510s. However, distracted by the task of establishing power in Iran, he did not tighten his hold on Georgia. He did raid Georgia a number of times, notably in 1518, which reconfirmed its status as a vassal, and in 1522, which resulted in Tiflis being garrisoned by a large Safavid force, but it was only under his son and successor Tahmasp I (r.1524‚Äì1576) that a genuine province with Safavid-appointed rulers and governors began to take shape. Tahmasp I undertook active steps to integrate Georgia into the Safavid domains. His four campaigns against Luarsab I of Kartli (1540‚Äì1541, 1546‚Äì1547, 1551, and 1553‚Äì1554) resulted in the re- occupation of Kartli, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tiflis in 1551. A key outcome of these campaigns, apart from cementing Safavid hold in central-eastern Georgia, was that they brought to Iran proper (hereafter, simply \\"Iran\\") large numbers of Georgian prisoners of war. Beyond this, the sons of notable Georgians were frequently brought up at the shah's court as part of their tributary relationship with the Safavids. Beginning with the rule of TahmaspI, Georgians would contribute greatly to the character of Safavid society and play a major role in its army and civil administration. This newly introduced ethnic element in the Safavid state would later be known in historiography as the \\"third force\\" alongside the two \\"founding elements\\" of the Safavid state, the Persians and the Turkomans. Safavid courtiers leading Georgian captives. A mid-16th century Persian textile panel from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1551 the Safavids gained the eastern part of the principality of Samtskhe. In 1555, during TahmaspI's reign, the Peace of Amasya was signed with the neighboring Ottoman Empire. According to the terms of the treaty, eastern Georgia (including eastern Samtskhe) remained in Iranian hands while western Georgia (including western Samtskhe) ended up in Turkish hands. To speed up the process of integration into the empire, TahmaspI imposed numerous Iranian political and social institutions such as bilingual Georgian‚ÄìPersian farm√¢ns, with the aim of establishing Persian as the official administrative language of Safavid Georgia. It was also during his reign that the first Georgian royal, a convert to Islam named Davud Khan (1569‚Äì1578) was put on the puppet throne in Tiflis. These events marked the start of almost 250 years of Iranian political dominance, with a few brief intermissions, over eastern Georgia. In 1559, the first provincial vizier was assigned to the Azerbaijan province, with authority over the Georgia province as well as Shirvan including Shakki. These provincial viziers, also known as royal viziers, held the title of vazir-e koll, and received instructions from the central government located in the royal capital, instead of the local governor. Challenging the Safavid possession of eastern Caucasus, the Ottomans invaded the Georgian polities in a victorious campaign in 1578. As a result, the Safavids released the Georgian rebel ruler Shahnavaz Khan (SimonI of Kartli) from captivity to enable him to join the fight against the Ottomans. Though Simon achieved considerable success in Kartli, he was eventually captured by the Ottoman troops and died in captivity in Constantinople. In the period 1580‚Äì1581 the Safavid government sent a force accompanied by the tupchi-bashi Morad Khan to Georgia together with a number of cannon founders and the materials needed for casting cannon. By 1582 the Ottomans were in control of the eastern, Safavid portion of Samtskhe. Unable to resist the Ottoman invasion, Manuchar II Jaqeli of Samtskhe accepted the Iranian overlordship as well and moved to the Safavid court, where he lived until his death in 1614. By the Treaty of Constantinople in 1590, the Safavids lost control over Georgia as they were forced to recognize the whole province as an Ottoman possession. =17th century= Rostam Khan (Rostom), vali of Kartli, eastern Georgia, 1633‚Äì1658 At the beginning of the rule of Abbas I, the importance of Georgia and the influence of ethnic Georgians in the Safavid state increased and they came to be known as the \\"third force\\". Already by 1595 an ethnic Georgian from Kartli, Allahverdi Khan, originally surnamed Undiladze, had become one of the most powerful figures in the Safavid state. By the end of the 16thcentury, Georgians, forming an increasingly influential military faction, became a major threat to the Qizilbash, the traditional backbone of the Safavid army. At the same time, the Georgians at the Safavid court vied for influence among each other as well as against their Circassian counterparts. By and large, AbbasI's policy towards the province can be seen as a continuing the previous efforts to fully integrate the area in the Safavid Empire. In the early years of the 17th century, Abbas re-established Safavid influence in eastern Georgia. There was a resistance in Kakheti in 1605, when the rebels overthrew pro-Iranian patricide Constantine Khan and AbbasI acceded to their demands to approve Tahmuras Khan (TeimurazI) as the new king of Kakheti. At the same time, he also confirmed Lohrasb (LuarsabII) as vali of Kartli. However, when Lohrasb started to work against Safavid interests and refused to convert to Islam, AbbasI had him incarcerated in Astarabad and later executed in Shiraz. In 1607 Abbas appointed Manuchar III Jaqeli as ruler of (eastern) Samtskhe. By 1613‚Äì1614 Abbas had restored Safavid control over eastern Samtskhe. In 1614‚Äì1617, as a punishment for disobedience shown by his formerly loyal subjects Lohrasb and Tahmuras Khan, AbbasI launched several major punitive campaigns in his Georgian territories. These campaigns resulted in the sack of Tiflis, the ravaging of the entire area, the massacre of many tens of thousands, and the deportation of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians to Iran. These deportees further augmented the Georgian community in Iran. In the meantime, AbbasI appointed Bagrat Khan as governor of Kartli, and Bektash Beg Torkman as governor of Kakheti. In 1619 AbbasI appointed Bagrat's son Semayun Khan, a loyalist born and raised in Isfahan, as khan, or vali, of Kartli, and appointed another non-royal Safavid official as governor of Kakheti, in order to maintain a tight grip on this part of the province. He also moved many Qizilbash tribal folk to the Georgia province in order to strengthen central control. From the mid-1610s onwards, Kakheti was often under the direct governorship of Qizilbash lords. Around 1620 Abbas relocated some 8,000 Jews from the province, along with 40,000 Armenians, to the newly built city of Farahabad. In these years, he moved a total of about 15,000 families from the Caucasus to Mazandaran. In 1624‚Äì25 Manuchar III Jaqeli, appointed earlier by AbbasI as nominal ruler of Samtskhe, moved to Kartli to join the rebellion of Murav-Beg (Giorgi Saakadze) against Safavid rule. Some time later, while away from Samtskhe, he decided to accept Ottoman suzerainty. However, when he returned to Samtskhe in 1625 for negotiations in the western (Ottoman) part of Samtskhe, he was killed by his own uncle. Subsequently, the Ottomans incorporated the western part of Samtskhe as a pashalik. The Safavids retained control of the eastern part. The remaining century of Safavid rule in Georgia, after AbbasI's death in 1629, was marked by unprecedented Iranian influence. Under the vali Khosrow Mirza, Safavid Georgia saw a period of relative peace and prosperity. In return for his loyalty, the then-incumbent king, Safi (), had given him the title of Rostam Khan, and had made him governor of Kartli, a post which he held for more than twenty years. Kakheti however, came under direct Safavid rule. Rostam Khan was a childless widower, however, and thus needed a wife and offspring. Being the loyal servant he was, after consulting the Safavid king, Rostam was allowed to marry a sister of Levan II Dadiani, ruler of Mingrelia (western Georgia), named Mariam. The marriage fit well with the political ambitions of the Safavid state and of Rostam himself. Not only would this alliance with the Dadiani, i.e. Mingrelia, give Rostam an ally against Tahmuras Khan (TeimurazI) and George III of Imereti, but it would also provide Rostam with a line of successors who would be as loyal to the Safavid crown as he was. Also important was the fact that it would enhance Safavid plans to conquer Imereti. It would create a perfect circumstance if a campaign was needed against the Ottomans, with whom they were at war at the time over Imereti. King Safi paid for the wedding gifts, and sent some 50,000 marchil, roughly half a ton of silver, to the ruler of Mingrelia, and provided him with an annual salary of 1,000 tomans (3-gram gold coins); an alliance was thus founded with the Mingrelians. The marriage preparations alarmed the Imeretians. The groom's party was a 30,000-strong army marching to meet Levan's heavily armed entourage. GeorgeIII of Imereti blocked the border with Kartli, compelling Rostom's wedding party to take a circuitous route via Akhaltsikhe, and intercepted Dadiani on his way to the marriage, but he was defeated and taken prisoner by Levan at the Kaka Bridge near Baghdati. In 1639, by the Treaty of Zuhab which ended the 1623‚Äì1639 war, the Caucasus was decisively partitioned between the Safavids and Ottomans roughly along the lines of the earlier Amasya treaty of 1555. Kartli and Kakheti were reconfirmed as Iranian domains, while everything to the west of it remained in Ottoman hands. Samtskhe‚ÄìMeskheti, including its eastern part, was irrevocably lost. In 1654, during the reign of King Abbas II (), Kartli was turned into crown land (khasseh), and therefore subjected to direct Safavid taxation. The amount of land directly taxed by the state reached its greatest extent in this year. Also during AbbasII's reign, an earlier plan was revived to populate the eastern part of the province, Kakheti, with Turkic nomads. This measure incited a general uprising in 1659. The rebels succeeded in expelling the nomads, but still had to accept the Safavid kings's suzerainty. In 1675 a wall was built around Tiflis by king Suleiman I (1666‚Äì1694). By the 1690s ethnic Georgians formed the mainstay of the Safavid army. =18th century= In 1701 one of the artillerymen (tupchis) in Tiflis was appointed vakil (\\"regent\\") of the tupchi-bashi of Tiflis fortress. Emamqoli Khan (DavidII), born and raised in Isfahan, and known for his loyal service to his Safavid overlords, was made governor of Kakheti in 1703‚Äì1709 by Sultan Husayn () due to his father, Nazar- Ali Khan (HeracliusI), being stationed at Isfahan during the entire period. Emamqoli Khan (DavidII of Kakheti) In 1709, following his father's death, he was formally appointed as the new governor of Kakheti. However, until 1715, he served as vali in absentia due to his being obliged to stay at the court in Isfahan. To the west, in Kartli, the administration was given to two successive governors who both served as vali in absentia due to being stationed in other parts of the empire: Shah-Navaz Khan II, Gorgin Khan (George XI); and Kaykhosrow Khan. Due to this, in the years 1703‚Äì1714, the administration there was led by two successive regents (janeshins) namely Shah-Qoli Khan (Levan) and Hosayn-Qoli Khan (VakhtangVI). In 1712‚Äì1719 Hosayn- Qoli Khan was forced to stay in Iran, and the Safavid king therefore gave the governorships of Kartli to others, amongst them Ali-Qoli Khan (Jesse) and janeshins such as Shah-Navaz, Bakar Mirza. In 1719 the Iranian government decided to send Hosayn-Qoli Khan, who had occupied several other high positions since 1716, back to Georgia with the task of handling the Lezgin rebellion. Assisted by the ruler of neighboring Kakheti, as well as the governor (beglarbeg) of Shirvan, Hosayn-Qoli made significant progress in putting a halt to the Lezgins. However, in the winter of 1721, at a crucial moment in the campaign, he was recalled. The order, which came after the fall of grand vizier Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, was made at the instigation of the eunuch faction within the royal court, who had persuaded the shah that a successful end to the campaign would do the Safavid realm more harm than good. In their view, it would enable Vakhtang, the Safavid vali, to form an alliance with Russia with an eye to conquering Iran. Shortly after, the Lezgins overran Shirvan, whereafter they sacked and looted the provincial capital of Shamakhi and massacred much of its population. In 1722 Emamqoli Khan died and was buried in Qom. Sultan Husayn then appointed his brother Mahmad Qoli Khan (ConstantineII) as the new governor of Kakheti. When the capital of Isfahan was put under siege in 1722, Hosayn-Qoli Khan defied the royal orders and refused to send the requested relief force. In the meantime, Russia took full advantage of the situation. With the Safavids on the brink of collapse, they launched a campaign in 1722‚Äì1723 that resulted in the annexation of the coastal territories. The Ottomans, also taking advantage of the situation, overran the province of Georgia and other territories to the west of the area that the Russians had captured. By the Treaty of Constantinople, the two powers further divided the annexed territories between them, with the Ottomans again retaining Georgia. The rebellious Hosayn-Qoli Khan, who had sided with the Russians during their invasion in 1722‚Äì1723, in what turned out to be an ill-fated alliance, died in exile in Russia in 1737. When the Safavids were restored by Nader Qoli Beg (later known as Nader Shah), the de facto ruler of Iran, he restored Iranian dominance in the Caucasus and made Teimuraz II vali of Kakheti, while appointing an Iranian as the governor of Kartli. In 1736 Nader deposed the Safavids and became king himself, establishing the Afsharid dynasty. Mint Silver abbasis minted in Tiflis during the reign of Sultan Husayn (), with minting dates varying from 1717‚Äì1718 to 1719‚Äì1720. Silver panj shahis minted in Tiflis in 1716‚Äì1717 during the reign of Sultan Husayn. One of the most important Safavid mints was located in the province of Georgia, in Tiflis. Close to the border with the Ottoman Empire, the Tiflis mint was important to the Safavids, for bullion (i.e. silver bars, Spanish reals, Dutch rijksdaalders) for the minting of coins was largely imported from and through the Ottoman Empire (and Russia). Upon arrival in Iran, the bullion was always brought to Tiflis, Erivan, or Tabriz to be melted into Iranian coins. Tiflis was thus a major stopping point for merchants who returned with silver. It was also one of the few mints, alongside the ones at Tabriz and Erivan (Yerevan), where re-minting took place. In the 17th century the Tiflis mint was one of the most active Safavid mints. The Tiflis mint also lay on a route widely used by silk traders. According to French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier, traders who went to Gilan to negotiate over silk, went to the mint at Tiflis, for the mint master (zarrab-bashi) gave a 2%discount on silver for silk traders. Tavernier notes that this is partly due to the silver coins from Tiflis being a little less fine. The coins minted at Tiflis were mostly used for the local citizens, rather than for the local Safavid garrison. The coins always had to bear the Safavid rulers' name and follow the Safavid types, legends, and weight standards. In many other regards, however, the appointed valis were granted a great deal of autonomy in terms of minting practises. For example, the vali reportedly was allowed to benefit from the profit accrued by the mints in the province. During the reign of Suleiman I, the economic situation worsened. The amount of precious metal coming into the country decreased, and as a result the quality of the coins diminished. This deficiency in weight was also apparent in coins from the Tiflis mint; in 1688, the abbasis and mahmudis struck at the mint were 22.5% below the standard weight they were supposed to have. The royal treasury was aware of the issue, and subsequently stopped accepting mahmudis that had been minted in Tiflis. In the years 1682‚Äì1685 the only Safavid mints that were recorded as active were the ones at Tiflis and Tabriz. According to a 1687 report, money played close to no role in Georgia. French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort confirms this: according to his texts of 1701, people in large parts of Georgia preferred to be paid in materials such as bracelets, rings, necklaces, and so forth. Stationed military force The province of Georgia hosted many Safavid soldiers, as it was considered a territory of the utmost importance. At the same time, it was a province that bordered the Ottoman Empire. A Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tiflis from 1551 onwards. According to Venetian reports, some 4,000 Safavid cavalry were stationed in Georgia and Ganja in the 1570s. According to traveller Jean Chardin, towards the end of AbbasI's reign many troops were stationed in Georgia, of which some 5,000 were \\"battle-experienced and trained\\". In the mid-17th century, during the reign of Abbas II (1642‚Äì1666), some 50,000 Safavid troops were stationed in the province according to Chardin's figures. The French missionary and traveller P√®re Sanson, who was in the Safavid Empire during the latter part of King Suleiman I's reign (1666‚Äì1694), wrote that a \\"large number\\" of troops were stationed in Georgia. Towards the end of Sultan Husayn's reign (1694‚Äì1722), the troops at the behest of the then-governor of Kartli, Hosayn-Qoli Khan (VakhtangVI), numbered some 10,000 Georgians and 3,000‚Äì4,000 Iranians. The vali of Georgia had a corps of qurchis at his disposal, including a qurchi- bashi, and a legion of specialized qurchis for his \\"accoutrements\\" (i.e. qurchi-e zereh, qurchi-e kafsh, qurchi-e tarkesh, etc.). They also had the institution of vakil (\\"regent\\"), who could take care of all matters in case it was needed. Silk and wine production Although the province contributed to the overall silk production, its silk was said, together with that of Karabakh‚ÄìGanja, to be of lesser quality than that of Gilan and Mazandaran. Following Abbas I's (1588‚Äì1629) decisive subduing of Georgia, he ordered that the province should produce more silk in the future. According to Nicolaas Jacobus Overschie, a Dutch representative in the Safavid Empire, of the 2,800 bales of silk that had been produced in 1636, the provinces of Georgia and Karabakh‚ÄìGanja had yielded a total of 300 bales. According to Jean Chardin, the wines produced in Georgia and Shiraz were of excellent quality. Every six months the province of Georgia supplied the royal wine cellars of the Safavid court with some three hundred liters of wine, as part of the total amount of taxes it paid. The governors were responsible for the supervision of the viticulture of their province. Cultural influences =Georgian culture= From the 16th century there was an increase of Iranian influence in Georgian culture. The genres in which it was most apparent were literature, painting, and architecture. During the Safavid period, many Georgian rulers, princes, and nobles had spent time in Iran. Therefore, Iranian traditions also spread throughout Georgia. The placement of Davud Khan (David XI) on the puppet throne of Kartli in 1562 did not just initiate a lengthy period of Iranian political dominance; in the same two and a half centuries that followed, until the coming of the Russians in the 19th century, Iranian cultural influence dominated eastern Georgia (Kartli‚ÄìKakheti). According to Jean Chardin, who was in Georgia in 1672, the Georgians followed Iranian traditions. Chardin assumed that the process had been influenced by those nobles who had converted to Islam (in order to obtain positions as state officials), as well as those who encouraged their female relatives to become ladies at court. In the Safavid period, \\"a great number of books\\" were translated from Persian into Georgian. The Rostomiani, the Georgian version of the Shahnameh, was further developed and improved, as well as Visramiani, the Georgian version of Vis o Ramin. According to a letter sent to the Pope by a Catholic missionary who flourished in the 17th century, Padre Bernardi, it was to his \\"great regret\\" that literate Georgians preferred to read works such as the Rostomiani (Shahnameh), Bezhaniani, and Baramguriani and were less interested in religious texts. Teimuraz I of Kakheti (Tahmuras Khan) is perhaps mostly remembered for creating issues for the central government, but he was fluent in Persian and fond of Persian poetry, which he \\"highly valued\\". In his words: Teimuraz wrote several poems influenced by the contemporary Persian tradition, packed with \\"Persian imagery and allusions, loanwords, and phraseology\\". A later Georgian ruler, VakhtangVI (Hosayn-Qoli Khan), was also important in this regard. When he was forced to stay in Iran, he learned to excel in Persian. He later used this skill to translate works into Georgian. He created a Georgian version of the Persian Qabusnameh known as Amirnasariani (\\"The story of Amirnasar\\", Amirnasar being the mythical Iranian king Kaykavus). During his detention in Iran, Vakhtang also translated into Georgian Kashefi's Kalƒ´leh o Demneh. Later, back in Georgia, he ordered the entire story to be translated once more, while his tutor, Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, also made a revised version of Vakhtang's own translation. Though Vakhtang, individually, was heavily involved in further developing Georgian-Iranian literary ties (in other words, by his own writings), he also founded an entire school dedicated to translators from Persian into Georgian. During this period, a number of folk stories (i.e. dastans) that were extremely popular in Iran, were translated into Georgian on his orders. One of these was the Bakhtiarnameh, a collection of several novellas, as well as the Baramgulandamiani (\\"Bahram o Golandam\\"), originally written by Katebi Nishapuri. The many other Persian-Georgian literary efforts of this era include translations of the Qur'an and books on Shia jurisprudence. =Iranian culture= In another, perhaps unorthodox, way Georgia also influenced the culture of Iran. According to a story, an ethnic Georgian named Scedan Cilaze was so renowned for being able to \\"hold\\" his liquor, that Safavid King Safi () invited him to the court in order to hold a drinking competition. After beating everyone at court, the king himself challenged Cilaze, and reportedly died doing so. Though Prof. Matthee reports that the story may be \\"apocryphal\\", as alcoholism did kill Safi, but not in relation to a drinking contest, it does show that Georgian habits had spread to Iran. In the Safavid period, large numbers of ethnic Georgian men entered Safavid government service, whereas many Georgian women entered the harems of the ruling elite and the royal court. Drinking alcohol, a prominent Georgian habits, influenced Iranian society, and more importantly, court culture, during this period. It is especially evident in the taxes the province had to paythey included many liters of wine. The royal harem, the private area of the royal court, was where Safavid rulers grew up; after AbbasI's reign, all Safavid rulers grew up there surrounded by mostly Georgian women. There were also many gholams who drank. Matthee therefore suggests that it is quite likely that the \\"fondness\\" for wine exhibited by Safavid rulers originated in this environment.

A graduate of the United States Military Academy and a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Chamberlaine was most notable for his service as a brigadier general in charge of artillery units during World War I. After graduating from West Point, Chamberlaine specialized in coastal and harbor defenses through the use of Coast Artillery. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he commanded a battery which defended the port of Mobile, Alabama. Chamberlaine's later assignments included military attach√© in Japan, command of posts which defended Boston Harbor, and command of the Coast Artillery School. Chamberlaine served as commander of two artillery brigades during World War I, including the Battle of Belleau Wood. He subsequently commanded the American Expeditionary Force's Railway Artillery Reserve, including combat during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. After the war, Chamberlaine served as chief of staff for the Hawaiian Department before retiring in 1923. He died in a Paris traffic accident in 1925, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Early life and education  William Chamberlaine was born on March 1, 1871 in Norfolk, Virginia, the son of William Wilson Chamberlaine and Matilda Dillaird Chamberlaine. He attended the United States Military Academy and graduated number 18 of 62 in the class of 1892. Start of career After graduation, Chamberlaine was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment. His initial assignments included duty at Fort Adams, Rhode Island, and Fort Hamilton, New York. He completed the Artillery Officers' Course in 1896, and was the honor graduate. Chamberlaine then served at Fort Monroe, Virginia, where he remained until the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, when he commanded a battery at Fort Morgan, Alabama, which defended Mobile Bay. In 1899, Chamberlaine was promoted to first lieutenant. His post-war assignments included acting assistant adjutant for the Department of Texas, instructor of chemistry at West Point, and assistant to the Army's Chief of Artillery at Fort Monroe. He was promoted to captain in 1901. Chamberlaine was assigned to the Artillery Board in 1903; this panel had been created as a result of a 1901 law which reorganized the Artillery branch and created the separate Coast Artillery. As a board member, Chamberlaine provided advice, guidance, and recommendations to the Chief of Artillery for matters including Artillery unit task organization, personnel assignments, and equipment and weapons design, testing, acquisition, and fielding. While serving on the board, Chamberlaine also commanded an Artillery battery at Fort Monroe. After the split of the Artillery branch, Chamberlaine chose to serve with the Coast Artillery, and became a specialist in coastal and harbor defenses. When the Army's General Staff was created in 1906, Chamberlaine was selected to serve on it. His first General Staff assignment was as a military attach√© in Japan, a posting he carried out in conjunction with Brigadier General John J. Pershing and Colonel James A. Irons; Irons also went on to serve as a general officer during World War I. From 1907 to 1909, Chamberlaine served as assistant chief of staff for first the Pacific Division, and then the Philippine Division; in each assignment, he served concurrently as division artillery officer. Among his accomplishments was the strengthening the defensive works that protected the Manila Bay, especially Corregidor Island. On his return trip to the United States, Chamberlaine traveled by way of Europe so he could serve as an observer at the French army's annual maneuvers. Continued career Chamberlaine was promoted to major in 1910, and assigned to commanded Fort Warren, the post which provided defense for Boston Harbor. In 1911, he commanded his battalion as provisional infantry soldiers on the U.S.-Mexico border. From late 1911 until September 1913, Chamberlaine was director of the Coast Artillery School. In his next assignment, Chamberlaine served as assistant to the Chief of Coast Artillery. While carrying out this assignment, Chamberlaine served on boards and committees which made recommendations for improving the coastal defenses of Panama, Guantanamo Bay, and the Chesapeake Bay. From March 1914 to February 1917, Chamberlaine was in command at Fort Andrews in Boston Harbor. He was then assigned to Fort Totten, New York as assistant to the commander of the North Atlantic Coast Artillery District; in this position, Chamberlaine planned for and coordinated the coast defenses of U.S. harbors in New York and New England. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July, 1917. World War I In August 1917, Chamberlaine was promoted to colonel and assigned to command the 6th Provisional Coast Artillery Regiment, which he organized, trained, and led to France. As a result of the contacts and relationships acquired during his previous experience in France, upon arrival, Chamberlaine was assigned as the U.S. liaison officer at the French Army's General Artillery Headquarters. He was promoted to brigadier general on December 17, 1917, and assigned to command the 57th Field Artillery Brigade. Chamberlaine commanded the 2nd Division's 2nd Field Artillery Brigade in May and June 1918. On June 24, 1918 during the Battle of Belleau Wood, Chamberlaine's artillery units fired a 14-hour barrage in preparation for an infantry attack led by Maurice E. Shearer's 5th Marine Regiment. Chamberlaine's success during the Belleau Wood fight led to his selection as commander of the American Expeditionary Force's Railway Artillery Reserve, which he led during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He was recommended for promotion to major general, but the war ended before the recommendation was acted on. Post-World War I In January, 1919 Chamberlaine returned to the United States and his permanent colonel's rank. He was assigned as commander of the Coast Artillery Training Center at Fort Monroe, where he remained until he was posted to Hawaii as chief of staff for the Army's Hawaiian Department. He retired on December 31, 1923, and was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Officers' Reserve Corps.

Sun is considered one of China's most prolific young artists and has received international acclaim. Early life Sun was born in Fuxin, Liaoning Province, China just after the end of the Cultural Revolution. He studied printmaking at the China Academy of Art, graduating in 2005. Career While at the Academy he wanted to make films but could not afford a camera. He decided to hand draw his films and began to create his first animations. The traditional mediums of painting, woodcuts, traditional Chinese ink and charcoal drawings are often combined to create the foundation of expressionistic, contemporary stop-motion animated films. His animated film, ‚ÄúShock of Time‚Äù, was made in 2006, a year after he graduated and met with great acclaim. The after effects of the Cultural Revolution have had a significant influence on the work he has created. He used newspapers from the 1950s to be the background of each frame in ‚ÄúShock of Time‚Äù. He founded an animation studio called Pi after achieving some success from ‚ÄúShock of Time‚Äù. More recently in 2014 he had a solo show called Time Vivarium at Sean Kelly Gallery in New York City. (1) The show was a commentary on how history can be different based on the position and perspective of the person telling it. He frequently uses the perspective of regular people to be part of his work. He creates works using many different mediums and often-using symbolic subject matter. He will often acknowledge or reference key moments of history in his work. (2) He also will depict animals in order to symbolize different people, places or ideas. He captures many different themes in his work such as the past versus the present, and reality versus fantasy. He has had a number of solo exhibitions at prestigious museums and galleries in Asia, Europe and North America including the Hayward Gallery, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Vancouver Art Gallery. His films have been shown at major film festivals, including the Torino Film Festival and The Seoul International Film Festival. In 2016 he was commissioned to do a piece called ‚ÄúTales of Our Time‚Äù for the permanent collection of the Guggenheim Museum.

(6) Works He produces a variety of different artworks that ranges from hand drawn conceptual animations and large scale experimental ink paintings. His artworks commonly display characteristics of an unnatural and dreamlike dimensions. Through his animations and large scale drawings he explores the dynamics between history and personal memory. He draws on subjects like childhood, memory, culture, history and politics for inspiration. Often, of which, he displays in dystopian or dreamlike depictions. Sun has been quoted saying that \\"[he] wants to make fun of peoples failings\\", as modern history is only a small fragment in the grand scheme of time, and countries and politicians have a sense of importance. Sun Xun gets is largely inspired by his travels, and sees his work no longer confined to the politics of china.  Maniac Universe (2018)  In July 2018, Sun Xun displayed a 40 meter long mixed media drawing on bark paper at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia. The painting was commissioned by the MCA for this exhibit only. The piece is a mix of hand drawn animals, insects, and fish painted in ink and UV-A light. The room in which it was displayed was lit up in purple light making the piece glow. The painting, like many of his other pieces, has an alternate universe style to it. The imagery is displayed to connect to a childlike imagination when looking up at the sky, leaving the viewer to decide their own meaning based on personal experience. The exhibit also featured his hand made woodcuts, and one of his animations \\"21 Grams\\". The single channel animation was meant to be an alternate view into the future. The exhibit at the MCA closed in October 2018.  Personal life  He currently lives and works in Beijing.

(Cambridge Peterhouse MS 190 f 214v) The Warkworth's Chronicle, now stylized \\"Warkworths\\" Chronicle, is an English chronicle formerly ascribed to John Warkworth, a Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. Known from only two manuscripts, it covers the years 1461‚Äì1474 and provides information on the recording and reception of historical events including the accession of King Edward IV and the murder of King Henry VI. Background, authorship, publication For a long time the chronicle was known from only a single manuscript, Cambridge, Peterhouse, MS 190, fols. 214v ‚Äì 225r.Manuscript is permanently on loan at Cambridge University Library; see Kaufman 50‚Äì51 n.5. Not until 1972 was a second copy discovered, by Lister M. Matheson, in Glasgow Library, MS Hunterian 83, fols 141r ‚Äì 148v; the chronicle had been overlooked since the catalogue of Hunterian manuscripts incorrectly listed its contents. In both manuscripts, Warkworth follows the Brut Chronicle, as a continuation; that version of the Brut ended in 1419 and is continued until 1461, with the additional text pulled from one of the Chronicles of England printed by William Caxton, itself a continuation of the Brut. Matheson concluded that the continuation in Hunterian 83, covering the years 1461‚Äì1474, was added to the manuscript in 1484, and was thence copied into Peterhouse 190, likely under Warkworth's supervision.Kaufman 50‚Äì51. A third manuscript, British Library MS. Harley 3730, is incomplete but contains material similar or identical to that of the Hunterian and Peterhouse manuscripts.Matheson 77. John Warkworth was Master of Peterhouse from 1473‚Äì1500, and he owned the Brut Chronicle of Peterhouse 190; for this reason the Warkworth Chronicle was ascribed to him as well, and thus named Warkworth Chronicle. Alexander Kaufman describes how Matheson changed its appellation: \\"Matheson chose to remove the italics from Warkworth and place the name instead in quotation marks to signify John Warkworth's involvement with the manuscript that contained the chronicle that was, at one time, attributed to him\\".Kaufman 51 n.6 The author, says Matheson, must have been a Northerner (based on orthographic and linguistic evidence), \\"an educated man with some sense of proportion and critical discrimination\\", likely a bibliophile with access to many texts and connected to the Peterhouse library. Since he was allowed to make additions to a manuscript in that library he must have had a certain standing. Matheson calculates that the author may have been in his late twenties when he wrote the chronicle and identified Roger Lancaster (d. 1502) and Thomas Metcalf (d. 1503), both Yorkshiremen, as the most likely candidates from the list of fellows of Peterhouse.Matheson 80‚Äì87. It was first published in 1839 by the Camden Society,Thomson 657. edited by James Halliwell-Phillipps, and reprinted in facsimile in 1988 and 1990.Matheson viii. Lister Matheson published an edition (collated from the two manuscripts) as Death and Dissent: Two Fifteenth- Century Chronicles (Boydell & Brewer, 1999).Brown. Content The chronicle covers the events of 1461 to 1474; it is \\"a well-known and frequently cited source\\" for that period. Matheson notes that the account of the first eight years are \\"confused\\", but that it improves from the account of the rebellion led by Robin of Redesdale (1469). It is especially valuable since it covers \\"the turbulent events in [the North ofMatheson vii.] England in 1470 and 1471\\", since sources for that period are difficult to come by and since it offers a \\"more provincial viewpoint\\" in contrast to chronicles produced in London.Matheson 61. Given the general propagandistic tone of contemporary chronicles that document the Wars of the Roses, the chronicle is \\"generally moderate\\" in tone, even though its probable author was \\"a Yorkshireman whose sympathies lay with Richard III\\". The descriptions of historical events are accompanied by a number of marvels or portents, which can be organized in two categories: natural phenomena, such as a heat wave and an incident of unstinting rain and flooding, which presage political turmoil;Kaufman 56-7. and true marvels, including two occurrences of the bleeding of the corpse of King Henry VI in 1471, and the appearance of a headless man crying \\"Bowes, bowes, bowes\\" on Dunsmore Heath in Warwickshire. Kaufman suggests that the man might be a barghest, \\"a fiend that is attached to a specific place\\", and that \\"bowes\\" is a conjugation of the verb \\"to bow\\", that is, the barghest signifies that in these difficult times it is good \\"to bend down in reverence, to be obedient and submit to God's will\\".Kaufman 58‚Äì62.

It is a sequel to Darksiders II and the third entry in the Darksiders series.  Gameplay  Darksiders III is a departure from the previous games, borrowing structure and gameplay elements from Metroidvania and FromSoftware's Souls series , the game is viewed as a mashup of elements of previous games and a new direction. Players take control of Fury, sister of War and Death, two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, from a third-person perspective. Fury, a mage who is described as the most unpredictable and enigmatic of the Four Horsemen, relies on whips, swords, flails, daggers and magic in combat. Fury can take on multiple different elemental forms in order to enhance her combat capabilities by granting her new weapons, attacks and traversal abilities. The combat is described as more methodical and straight forward not focusing on large crowds of enemies like the previous games and removing the hit counter. Enemies are stronger than in previous installments but appear in smaller numbers during encounters, so as to make battles feel more personal. Some enemies from previous games return, while other foes are new. Gated combat is not a feature, in an attempt to make everything within the setting contextualized and interconnected like the Souls series. Darksiders III focuses on its leveling system in which Fury's damage, health, and arcane damage can be upgraded. The threats of the game's world will grow stronger as the player progresses through the story. Similar to War, yet dissimilar to Death, Fury collects souls from enemies and from objects in the environment, as a form of currency or an expendable resource. The player can attach \\"Enhancement\\"s to Fury's weapons for different perks and damage boosts. The game takes place in a continuous environment where exploration plays a large role in gathering more lurchers and materials to upgrade Fury herself and her arsenal. While exploring, Fury must solve simple puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles, some of which make use of her whip. Such puzzles include using bombs to blow up obstructed pathways or Fury's Forms to interact with the environment.  Plot  Taking place parallel with Darksiders II and before the majority of Darksiders, Fury, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is summoned by the Charred Council and tasked with hunting down the Seven Deadly Sins, which have escaped imprisonment; one of the Watchers accompanies her on her quest. Upon arriving on the war-torn, post-apocalyptic Earth, Fury encounters the first of the Sins, Envy. Upon Envy's defeat, Fury claims one of her talismans and uses it as a prison to hold Envy. Not long after, she finds her way to a sanctuary named Haven, where she encounters Ulthane (previously introduced in Darksiders) and some humans who survived the Apocalypse. Ulthane tasks Fury with sending any Humans she finds to Haven. She then leaves to find the next Sin, Wrath. Fury comes upon Wrath engaged in fighting and killing angels. Gaining the upper hand, Fury summons her horse, Rampage, which gets killed by a mysterious, angelic weapon. Grief-stricken and enraged, Fury loses focus and Wrath runs her through while she is distracted. With her dying breath, she pulls the blade out and stabs Wrath in the face before losing consciousness. As Fury lays dying on the ground, a fiery portal takes her to the Lord of the Hollows, a powerful entity with the ability to release other beings from the cycle of life, death and rebirth in the Well of Souls. The Lord informs a skeptical Fury that she is being manipulated by the Charred Council for their own schemes, but nonetheless aids her by giving her the Fire Hollow, a mystical artifact that enhances her combat abilities. He also instructs her to hunt down the demon Abraxis and return to him with the demon's soul. As Fury recaptures the Sins after another, the Lord of Hollows continues to gift her with new Hollows to aid in her mission. Confronting Abraxis in the demon's stronghold, Fury demands to know why the Lord of Hollows wants him dead. Abraxis tells her that a new dark lord is coming, known only as The Destroyer, and reveals that the Lord of Hollows intends to hollow the mortal realm to install a new order. At this point in the story, the player is given a choice: ‚Ä¢ If the player chooses to believe Abraxis, the demon will thank Fury and welcome her to his master's home any time. Upon returning to the Lord of Hollows, the player will be given the option to face him in combat or choose to believe him. If the player still chooses to believe Abraxis, the Lord will simply be killed. ‚Ä¢ Alternatively, if the player decides to believe the Lord of Hollows, Abraxis will be killed and his soul claimed as the prize. The Lord of Hollows then reveals details of his own past and the Council's corruption: he was once a welcome delegate who sat at the Council's table, but quickly grew disillusioned with their obsessive ways and half-measures in enforcing the Balance, only monitoring the kingdoms of Heaven and Hell while leaving the Kingdom of Man to fend for itself. This culminated in the Council pleading ignorance, when in truth they deliberately allowed the premature Apocalypse to happen. The Lord goes on to explain that aiding Fury was his way of making amends for an eternity of inaction before ending his own life, leaving behind a mysterious object for future use. Eventually Fury confronts and defeats the final Sin, Pride. Pride lends credence to the Lord of Hollows' claims, revealing that the Council have been secretly betraying the Balance behind everyone's backs from the start. The Watcher that has been trailing Fury the whole time reveals herself to be the game's true final sin, the real Envy. Having tricked Fury and the Council to strengthen herself by absorbing the rest of the sins into her amulet, Envy confirms the truth in Pride's words after taking the Talisman, and with it the powers of those trapped within. Taking advantage of Fury's weakened state, Envy uses the Talisman of Sin to immobilizes the Horseman and absorb her strength. Envy reveals that the Council's plan was to pit the Horsemen and Sins against each other, hoping that both sides would destroy each other, all the while boasting of having been able to take advantage of everything from Fury's egotism to the Council's trickery in order to obtain supreme power for herself; ultimately, Envy intends to use her enhanced abilities to face the Charred Council for control of the Earth. Fury takes a steep fall, but survives her predicament with help from Humans that she had rescued over the course of her adventures and turned over to the Makers care. Ulthane aids her by presenting a means he'd spent the whole story working on. Revealing he knew more than he let on, the Blackhammer has constructed a Reflecting Pool to get her to the Council's domain and confront Envy as well as her former masters. With new resolve, Fury defeats Envy and binds the Sin within the Talisman, but the Charred Council no longer values Fury and wants her dead along with her brothers. If the player has the mysterious stone sigil given by the Lord of Hollows, Fury uses it to block the Charred Council's attack, the latter halting out of fear of its power. Although she does not know what the stone truly is, she realizes the council abhors it and knows it to be a tool of great power. Fury resists when they demand she give it to them and instead detonates the Talisman of Sin, defeating the Council and leaving their citadel to crumble around them, while beating a hasty retreat back to Earth. Returning to Haven, she finds it beset by demons of the Destroyer's army. With Hell's forces converging on their location, the Makers utilize the same portal created to breach the Council Chamber as an exit strategy to save what remains of humanity. Having been changed and humbled by her journey, Fury vows to protect the last surviving humans and prepares to depart. Realizing that War was innocent all along, she requests that Ulthane aid her brother in any way possible should they meet. As she watches the fight before departing, the lone human helping the Makers fend off the demons is revealed as her brother and fellow horseman, Strife; the two share a knowing nod before Fury leaves. With the survivors now safe and hidden away in another realm, Lucifer knows what Fury has done and, depending on the player's choices, is angered at Lilith for not silencing the Lord of Hollows when she had the chance. However, he still intends to carry out his own plans of destruction.  Development and release  Promotion at the 2018 PAX West A third entry in the Darksiders series was originally planned by Vigil Games, however, the fate of its franchise was threatened due to financial complications. Its parent company, THQ, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The company's assets were sold at an auction, excluding Vigil Games, which was shut down along with the parent company, THQ. In April 2013, THQ began a process to auction off the remaining IP that it had not yet sold, including Darksiders. Several companies publicly expressed interest in bidding for the franchise, including the Japanese developer PlatinumGames, and Crytek USA, a new Crytek subsidiary led by former Vigil CEO David Adams, and primarily staffed by former Vigil employees. Adams had expressed interest in allowing Darksiders to come back \\"home\\" to its creators. On April 22, 2013, Darksiders, along with Red Faction and MX vs. ATV, were purchased by Nordic Games in the final transaction of THQ's assets. On June 14, 2013, Nordic Games has stated in an interview with Joystiq that fans \\"[should] not look for a Darksiders III before two years from now\\". On May 2, 2017, a product listing for Darksiders III appeared on Amazon.com. The game was announced the same day by publisher THQ Nordic to be under development by Gunfire Games. The development team largely consists of former Vigil Games employees whose previous work includes development of the first two Darksiders games. The game was revealed to be released on November 27, 2018. Alongside it, THQ Nordic announced various editions for the game; a deluxe edition, which comes with the soundtrack and two future downloadable content packs, the Collector's Edition, which comes with a Fury figurine, and the Apocalypse edition, which comes with figurines of War, Death, Fury and Vulgrim. On December 20, 2018, a patch was released for the game adding a \\"Classic\\" mode to make the game 'feel' more like its two predecessor games, such as allowing Fury to dodge, interrupt her attacks and use items instantly. Reception =Critical response= Darksiders III received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.. The third game was widely criticized for the technical issues in both consoles and PC versions of the game. Eurogamer review criticized the \\"straight forward combat\\" saying it is a matter of \\"upgrade weapon damage\\" and that the few puzzles are too simple, and in concluding that it \\"has done better in the past\\". GameSpot review said that the game is \\"unfocused\\", that the \\"clear inspiration from Dark Souls\\" go against the rest of the series design, that the game has \\"rudimentary puzzles\\" and concludes by saying that \\"Darksiders 3 retrogrades on its predecessors with an unfocused approach that constantly clashes itself\\". PC Gamer review said that the game doesn't commit itself enough on the RPG department due to the game's lack of a loot system and weapons being earned as the plot goes on, \\"you're just bumping up damage output\\". He ends his review saying \\"It doesn't condemn Darksiders to oblivion, but it‚Äôs the lowlight of the series so far.\\" =Sales= The game debuted at 32nd place in the UK's all-format sales charts. According to reports, the game managed to sell 71,000 copies on Steam alone in its first week. On February 18, 2019, in a financial quarter report, THQ Nordic has announced that the game has made its development and marketing budget back and reiterated its commitment to the franchise. Sequel Prior to the game's release, the CEO of THQ Nordic announced that if Darksiders III reached over 100,000 copies sold, the company would look into a sequel. A spin-off game was announced on June 6, 2019 titled Darksiders: Genesis.

It carries California State Route 61 and links the main island of Alameda with Bay Farm Island within the city of Alameda. The present bridge was completed in 1953; it is paralleled by a second bridge (completed in 1995) devoted to pedestrian and bicycle traffic, the Bay Farm Island Bicycle Bridge. The draw opens approximately 360 times per year. The Bay Farm Island Bridge is one of the four bridges and two tunnels linking Alameda Island with the mainland. It is the longest bridge of the four.  History  A toll bridge at this location was first built in 1854, consisting of a wooden trestle surfaced with crushed oyster shells. The owners abandoned the bridge after a failed business deal for land on Bay Farm Island, and the 1854 bridge subsequently rotted. Alameda County constructed a second bridge in 1875. In 1877 the bridge was described as a drawbridge with an overall length of . The second bridge had been repaired in 1890, and was replaced by a third bridge in 1898. Parts of the third bridge had initially been built in 1881 to span the Oakland Estuary at Webster Street, and were moved to span the San Leandro Channel in 1898; the third bridge was a swing-type bridge. By 1904, it was described as a \\"creaking old bridge\\", and by 1912, the bridge had \\"settled dangerously\\" and \\"needed immediate repairs.\\" In 1899, Mr. Gighilone, a vegetable farmer from Bay Farm Island, was ambushed by customs officers while crossing the bridge. The customs officers believed he was in league with opium smugglers who supposedly had their headquarters on Bay Farm Island; the smugglers purportedly used vegetable peddlers to smuggle opium across the bridge to Alameda, where it would be taken to San Francisco for distribution. When Gighilone was commanded to stop, he thought he was being robbed and attempted to escape until several bullets convinced him to stop. The fourth bridge, completed in 1953 and opened for service on July 1 of that year, was constructed by the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) as part of California State Route 61. It is owned and maintained by CalTrans, District 4. The total cost of the 1953 bridge, including right-of-way acquisition, approach structures, engineering, design, and construction, was . The bicycle bridge was constructed between 1993 and 1995 at a cost of approximately . In late 2015 and early 2016, the road and bicycle bridges were temporarily closed at night to accommodate maintenance activities, including repainting the road bridge. It had last been painted in 1978.  Design  The 1953 road bridge is the longest bascule bridge in Alameda County by overall length. It was designed to accommodate a future second leaf, if warranted by marine traffic, to double the navigable channel width from to . The existing leaf is opened by two motors in approximately 135 seconds. The bridge was designed by the California Division of Highways, Bridge Department. The main pier of the 1953 road bridge is the largest cofferdam built on a state highway since the construction of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. The bascule span is long and carries a counterweight of . Interlocks are provided so that traffic gates and bollards must be raised before the draw can be opened. The 1995 bicycle bridge is linked to the 1953 road bridge so that when the road bridge opens, the bicycle bridge also opens; however, the bicycle bridge can be operated manually to open independently of the road bridge. The bicycle bridge is operated using two hydraulic pistons and two motors; the other drawbridges linking Alameda to the mainland operate using gearboxes and gears. It is the only pedestrian bascule bridge in the United States.  References  External links * * . Video showing closing sequence of both bridges.

The self-cleaning functionality of these surfaces are commonly inspired by natural phenomena observed in lotus leaves, gecko feet, and water striders to name a few. The majority of self-cleaning surfaces can be placed into three categories: 1) Superhydrophobic, 2) Superhydrophilic, and 3) Photocatalytic.  History  The first instance of a self-cleaning surface was created in 1995. Paz et al. created a transparent titanium dioxide (TiO2) film that was used to coat glass and provide the ability for the glass to self-clean. The first commercial application of this self-cleaning surface, Pilkington Activ, was developed by Pilkington glass in 2001. This product implements a two-stage cleaning process. The first stage consists of photocatalysis of any fouling matter on the glass. This stage is followed by the glass becoming superhydrophilic and allowing water to wash away the catalyzed debris on the surface of the glass. Since the creation of self-cleaning glass, titanium dioxide has also been used to create self-cleaning nanoparticles that can be incorporated into other material surfaces to allow them to self-clean.  Surface characteristics  The ability of a surface to self-clean commonly depends on the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the surface. Whether cleaning aqueous or organic matter from a surface, water plays an important role in the self-cleaning process. Specifically, the contact angle of water on the surface is an important characteristic that helps determine the ability of a surface to self-clean. This angle is affected by the roughness of the surface and the following models have been developed to describe the \\"stickiness\\" or wettability of a self-cleaning surface. = Young's model = Young's model of wetting is used to describe the relationship between a water droplet and a perfectly flat surface. This model is typically used to explain the self-cleaning mechanism of lotus leaves. Young and colleagues proposed Young's model of wetting that relates the contact angle of a water droplet on a flat surface to the surface energies of the water, the surface, and the surrounding air. This model is typically an oversimplification of a water droplet on an ideally flat surface. This model has been expanded upon to consider surface roughness as a factor in predicting water contact angle on a surface. Young's model is described by the following equation: cos(\\\\theta_0)=\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_{SA}-\\\\gamma_{SL}}{\\\\gamma_{LA}} \\\\right ) \\\\theta_0 = Contact angle of water on the surface \\\\gamma_{SA}= Surface energy of the surface-air interface \\\\gamma_{SL}= Surface energy of surface-liquid interface Wenzel's model of wetting is used to describe the interface between a water droplet and a rough surface. \\\\gamma_{LA}= Surface energy of liquid-air interface = Wenzel's model = When a water droplet is on a surface that is not flat and the surface topographical features lead to a surface area that is larger than that of a perfectly flat version of the same surface, the Wenzel model is a more accurate predictor of the wettability of this surface. Wenzel's model is described by the following equation: cos(\\\\theta)=R_fcos(\\\\theta_0) \\\\theta = Contact angle of water predicted by Wenzel's model R_f = Ratio of surface area of rough surface to the surface area of a flat projection of the same surfaceCassie Baxter's model of wetting is used to describe the interface between a water droplet and a surface when the water droplet creates air pockets between itself and the surface topographical features on the surface. = Cassie-Baxter's model = For more complex systems that are representative of water-surface interactions in nature, the Cassie-Baxter model is used. This model takes into consideration the fact that a water droplet may trap air between itself and the surface that it is on. The Cassie-Baxter model is described by the following equation: cos(\\\\theta_{CB})=R_fcos(\\\\theta_0)-f_{LA}(R_fcos(\\\\theta_0)+1) \\\\theta_{CB} = Contact angle of water predicted by Cassie-Baxter's model f_{LA} = Liquid-air fraction, the fraction of the liquid droplet that is in contact with air  Mechanisms  = Use of water = A) A superhydrophobic surface with a high contact angle nearing 180 degrees. B) A surface with a low water sliding angle. C) A surface with a higher sliding angle which will be less efficient when self-cleaning water from its surface. Control over surface wettability is a critical aspect of self-cleaning surfaces. Both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces have been used as self-cleaning materials.  Superhydrophobic  Superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a number of different ways including plasma or ion etching, crystal growth on a material surface, and nanolithography to name a few. All of these processes create nano-topographical features which imbue a surface with superhydrophobicity. The ultimate goal in developing superhydrophobic surfaces is to recreate the self-cleaning properties of the Lotus Leaf that has the inherent ability to repel all water in nature. The basis for superhydrophobic self-cleaning is the ability of these surfaces to prevent water from spreading out when in contact with the surface. This is reflected in a water contact angle nearing 180 degrees. Superhydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces also have low sliding angles which allows for water that is collected on the surface to easily be removed, commonly by gravity. While superhydrophobic surfaces are great for removing any water-based debris, these surfaces likely will not be able to clean away other types of fouling matter such as oil.  Superhydrophilic  A) A water droplet on a superhydrophilic surface has a very low water contact angle since water will spread out on the surface. B) Dirt or debris (blue circle) on a super hydrophilic surface can be lifted off of the surface as water spreads beneath it. When water slides off of the surface, the debris is removed with the water. Superhydrophilicity allows for surfaces to clean away a wide variety of dirt or debris. This mechanism is very different than the aforementioned superhydrophobic surfaces. For superhydrophilic self-cleaning surfaces, cleaning occurs because water on the surface is able to spread out to a great degree (extremely low water contact angle) to get between any fouling debris and the surface to wash away the debris. = Photocatalysis = One of the most commonly used self-cleaning products, titanium dioxide, utilizes a unique self-cleaning mechanism that combines an initial photocatalytic step and subsequent superhydrophilicity. A titanium dioxide coating, typically on glass windows, when exposed to UV light, will generate free electrons that will interact with oxygen and water in the air to create free radicals. These free radicals will in turn breakdown any fouling organic matter deposited on the surface of the glass. Titanium dioxide also changes the normally hydrophobic glass to a superhydrophilic surface. Thus, when rainfall occurs, instead of water beading up on the window surface and instantly falling down the glass, rain drops will rapidly spread out on the hydrophilic surface. The water will then move down the surface of the window, as a film rather than a droplet, essentially acting like a squeegee to remove surface debris.  In nature  = Plants =  Lotus leaf  The lotus flower has been known as a symbol of purity in some Asian cultures. The lotus leaves (Nelumbo nucifera) are water-repellent and poorly adhesive which keep them free from contamination or pollution even being immersed in dirty water. This ability, called self-cleaning, shows that Nature shields itself from dirt and pathogens and self-cleaning plays a vital role in the resistance towards invading microbes. Indeed, numerous spores and conidia of pathogenic life forms, mainly fungi, need aqua for germination and taint leaves within the sight of water. It had been a curiosity how lotus flower could remain clean even in muddy water, until German botanists, Barthlott and Neinhuis, introduced the unique dual structure of leaves with the help of a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Papillose epidermis cells carpet the exterior of a plant, particularly the leaf. These cells generate papillae or microasperties which make surface very rough. On top of microscale roughness, the papillae surface is superimposed with nanoscale asperities consisting of three- dimensional (3-D) hydrophobic hydrocarbons: epicuticular waxes. Basically, the plant cuticle is a composite material composed of a network of cutin and low surface energy waxes, designed at different hierarchical levels. The various leveled surface of lotus leaves is made out of convex cells (looks like bumps) and a much smaller layer of waxy tubules. The water beads on plant leaves rest on the apex of the nanofeatures since air is enclosed in the valley of convex cells which minimizes the contact area of water droplet. Hence, the lotus leaves represent remarkable superhydrophobicity. Static contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of the lotus leaf are determined around 164¬∞ and 3¬∞, respectively. With small tilting angles, water droplets on the leaf roll off and take any dirt or contaminant along, leading to self-cleaning. The ability of drops to form and roll off, depends not only on hydrophobicity, but also on contact angle hysteresis. In plants world, the lotus leaf is not the only example of natural superhydrophobic surfaces. For instance, taro (Colocasia esculenta) leaves were found to exhibit self-cleaning behavior, too. They have a binary roughness built up by averagely 10 mm elliptical protrusions in diameter and nano-sized pins. India canna (Cannageneralis bailey) leaves and the rice leaves (whatever the kind of rice) also represent superhydrophobicity, arising from the hierarchical surface morphology.  Nepenthes pitcher plants  The Nepenthes carnivorous pitcher, widespread in a lot of countries such as, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia, possesses a superhydrophilic surface, on which wetting angle approaches to zero to create uniform water film. Therefore, it increases the slipperiness of the surface and the prey slides off from its rims (peristome). Surface topography of Nepenthes rim demonstrates multiple scale radial ridges. The second order ridges are quite small in size and generated by straight rows of overlapping epidermidis cells. The surface of epidermidis cells are smooth and wax-free. The absence of wax crystals and microscopic roughness enhance the hydrophilicity and capillary forces, in doing so, water can swiftly wet the surface of rim. = Animals =  Butterfly wings  Butterfly wings possess not only ultra-hydrophobic trait but also directional adhesive characteristics. If the water bead is along the radial outward (RO) direction from the body‚Äôs central axis, it rolls off and cleans the dirt away, leading to self-cleaning. On the other hand, if droplets stand against the opposite direction, they are pinned at the surface, leading adhesion and securing the flight stability of the butterfly by preventing deposit of dirt on the wings near the center of the body. SEM micrographs of wings exhibit hierarchy along the RO direction, arising from aligned microgrooves, covered by fine lamella- stacking nanostripes.  Water striders (Gerris remigis)  Water striders (Gerris remigis), most commonly called Jesus bugs, have an extraordinary ability that lets them walk on the water. In a fashion similar to superhydrophobic plants, their legs are highly water repellent due to their hierarchical morphology. They are built up with hydrophobic waxy microhairs, microsetae, and each hair is covered with nanogrooves. As a result, air is entrapped between micro- and nanohairs, which repels water. Feng et al. measured how deep the leg can dip into water and the contact angle of the leg. They found the contact angle at least 168¬∞ and the maximum depth reported 4.38 ¬± 0.02 mm.  Gecko feet  Gecko feet are the most famous reversible adhesion mechanism in nature. The anti-fouling ability of feet allows geckos to run on dusty ceilings and corners without the accumulation of dirt on their feet. In 2000, Autumn et al. revealed the origin of gecko‚Äôs strong adhesion by investigating the surface features of the toes under electron microscope. They observed a hierarchical morphology of each foot which is composed of millions of small hair called setae. Moreover, each setae is composed of a smaller hair, and each hair is tailed with a flat spatula and these spatulae are bonded by the van der Waals forces. This surface feature, regardless of the surface type (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, dry, wet, rough etc.), enables geckos to stick the surface. In addition to strong adhesion, the gecko foot has a unique self-cleaning property which does not require water as the lotus leaf.  Shark skin  Shark skin is another example of antifouling, self- cleaning and low adhesion surfaces. This hydrophilic surface allows sharks to maneuvers fast in water. Shark skin is composed of periodically arranged diamond-shape dermal denticles, superimposed with triangular riblets.  Fabrication and characterization  To fabricate synthetic self-cleaning surfaces, there are a variety of methods used to obtain the desired nanotopography and then characterize surface nanostructure and wettability. = Templating strategies = Templating utilizes a mold to add nanostructure to a polymer. Molds can come from a variety of sources including natural sources, such as the lotus leaf, due to their self-cleaning properties.  Nanocasting  Nanocasting is a method based on soft lithography which uses elastomeric molds to make nano-structured surfaces. For example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was cast over the lotus leaf and used to make a negative PDMS template. PDMS was then coated with an anti-stick monolayer of trimethylchlorosilane and used to make a positive PDMS template from the first. As the natural lotus leaf structure enables pronounced self-cleaning ability, this templating technique was able to replicate the nanostructure, resulting in a surface wettability similar to the lotus leaf. Further, the ease of this methodology enables translation to mass replication of nano- structured surfaces.  Imprint nanolithography  Imprint nanolithography also utilizes templates, pressing a hard mold into a polymer above the polymer glass transition temperature (Tg). Thus, the driving forces for this type of fabrication are heat and high pressure. Porous templates consisting of aluminum with anodized aluminum oxide (a hard mold) were used to imprint polystyrene. To achieve this, the polystyrene was heated well above its Tg to 130 degrees Celsius and pressed against the template. The template was then removed by dissolving the aluminum and producing either nanoemboss or nanofiber surfaces. Increasing the aspect ratio of the nanofibers disrupted the uniform hexagonal pattern and caused the fibers to form bundles. Ultimately, the longest nanofibers resulted in the greatest surface roughness, which significantly decreased surface wettability.  Capillary nanolithography  Similar to imprint nanolithography, capillary nanolithography employs a patterned elastomeric mold. However, instead of utilizing high pressure, when the temperature is raised above the Tg, capillary forces enable the polymer to fill the voids within the mold. Suh and Jon used molds made from poly(urethane acrylate) (PUA). These were placed on spin coated, water-soluble polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), which was raised above PEG's Tg. This study found that the addition of nanotopography increased the contact angle, and this increase was dependent on the height of the nanotopography. Often, this technique produces a meniscus on the tip of the protruding nanostructures, characteristic of capillary action. The mold can later be dissolved away. Combinatorial lithography approaches are also used. One study used capillarity to fill PDMS molds with PUA, first partially curing the polymer resin with UV light. After microstructures were formed, pressure was applied to fabricate nanostructures, and UV curing was used again. This study is a good example of the use of hierarchical structures to increase surface hydrophobicity.  Photolithography or X-ray lithography  Photolithography and X-ray lithography have been used to etch substrates, often silicon. A resist, or photosensitive material, is coated onto a substrate. A mask is applied above the resist that often consists of gold or other compounds that absorb X-rays. The region exposed to light either becomes soluble in a photoresist developer (e.g. radical species) or insoluble in a photoresist developer (e.g. crosslinked species), ultimately resulting in a patterned surface. X-ray sources are beneficial over UV-visible light sources as the shorter wavelengths enable production of smaller features. = Other fabrication strategies =  Plasma treatment  Plasma treatment of surfaces is essentially a dry etching of the surface. This is achieved by filling a chamber with gas, such as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine, and accelerating ions species from an ion source through plasma. The ion acceleration towards the surface forms deep grooves within the surface. In addition to the topography, plasma treatment can also provide surface functionalization by using different gases to deposit different elements on surfaces. Surface roughness is dependent on the duration of plasma etching.  Chemical deposition  Generally, chemical deposition uses liquid or vapor phases to deposit inorganic materials or halides onto surfaces as thin films.Self-cleaning Coatings, Editor: Junhui He, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2017, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78262-399-1 Reagents are supplied in the appropriate stoichiometric amounts to react on the surface. Types of chemical deposition include chemical vapor deposition, chemical bath deposition, and electrochemical deposition. These methodologies produce thin crystalline nanostructures. For example, brucite-type cobalt hydroxide crystalline surfaces were produced by chemical bath deposition and coated with lauric acid. These surfaces had individual nanofiber tips with diameters of 6.5 nm, ultimately resulting in a contact angle as high as 178 degrees. = Surface characterization methods =  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  SEM is used to examine morphology of fabricated surfaces, enabling the comparison of natural surfaces with synthetic surfaces. The size of nanotopography can be measured. To prepare samples for SEM, surfaces are often sputter coated using platinum, gold/palladium, or silver, which reduces sample damage and charging and improves edge resolution.  Contact angle  As described above, contact angle is used to characterize surface wettability. A droplet of solvent, typically water for hydrophobic surfaces, is placed perpendicular to the surface. The droplet is imaged and the angle between the solid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces is measured. Samples are considered to be superhydrophobic when the contact angle is greater than 150 degrees. Refer to section on Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter models for information on the different behaviors of droplets on topographical surfaces. For drops to roll effectively on a superhydrophobic surface, Contact angle hysteresis is an important consideration. Low levels of contact angle hysteresis will enhance the self-cleaning effect of a superhydrophobic surface.  Atomic force microscopy (AFM)  Atomic-force microscopy is used to study the local roughness and mechanical properties of a surface. AFM is also used to characterize adhesion and friction properties for micro- and nano-patterned superhydrophobic surfaces. Results can be used to fit a curve to the surface topography and determine the radius of curvature of nanostructures.  Biomimetic synthetic surfaces  Biomimicry is the imitation, or mimicry, of biological systems, models, or structures, in synthetic areas. Oftentimes, biological materials can produce structures, that have properties and qualities far exceeding what synthetic materials can achieve. Biomimicry is being used to create comparable properties in synthetic materials, particularly in wettability and self-cleaning abilities of self- cleaning surfaces. = Superhydrophobic biomimetic surfaces = There are several biological surfaces that have superhydrophobic properties far superior to any synthetic materials: lotus leaves, rice leaves, cicadia wings, and butterfly wings.  Lotus leaf  Researchers have been using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to mimic the papillae of lotus leaves. CNT nanoforests can be made using chemical vapor deposition techniques. CNT‚Äôs can be applied on a surface to modify its water contact angle. Lau et al. created vertical CNT forests with a polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) coating that was both stable and superhydrophobic with an advancing and receding contact angle of 170¬∞ and 160¬∞. Jung and Bhushan have created a superhydrophobic surface by spray coating CNTs with an epoxy resin. The spacing and alignment of the CNTs have been shown to impact the degree of hydrophobicity a surface has. Sun et al., have found that CNTs aligned vertically with a medium spacing display the best hydrophobic properties. Small and large spacing shows increased drop spreading, while horizontal orientation may even display hydrophilic properties. Glass silica beads in an epoxy resin, and the electrochemical deposition of gold into dendritic structures has also created synthetic biomimetic surfaces similar to lotus leaves.  Rice leaves  Carbon nanotubes have also been used to create surfaces similar to rice leaves. Similar to the lotus leaf, a hierarchical structure provides the hydrophobicity of rice leaf. Unlike the lotus leaf, rice leaves have an anisotropic structure. When CNT‚Äôs are made to mimic rice leaf papillae patterns, the contact angle to differ along the CNT direction or perpendicular. Sun et al. observed anisotropic dewetting of this CNT film. They then hypothesized and tested a three-dimensional anisotropic CNT array, which in fact exhibited anisotropic dewetting depending on the CNT spacing.  Cicadia wing  Cicadia wings have a surface of hexagonally close packed nanopillars that have been shown to have self-cleaning properties. Similarly templated nanopatterned silica arrays have been shown to have hydrophobic, anti-reflective, and self-cleaning properties. These silica arrays begin as non-close packed monolayers, and are patterned in a series of etching steps involving chlorine and oxygen reactive ion etching, and a hydrofluoric acid wash. These properties have implicated that this surface pattern may prove to be useful in solar cell applications. Biomimetic materials based on the cicadia wing have also been made from polytetrafluoroethylene films with carbon/epoxy supports treated with argon and oxygen ion beams. A nanoimprint patterned surface based on the cicadia wings has been made by electrochemically templating and aluminum sheet with alumina oxide, and using this template to pattern a polymer surface.  Butterfly wing  Butterfly wings also exhibit anisotropic self-cleaning, superhydrophobic properties. The butterfly wings exhibit anisotropy on a one dimensional level, compared to the other biological materials, which exhibited the anisotropy on a two dimensional level. Butterfly wings are composed of overlapping layers of scales, that have the best self-cleaning properties in the radial directions. This anisotropic interface my prove important for fluid controllable interfaces. Alumina layers patterned from the original butterfly wing have been used to mimic the structure and properties of the butterfly wings. Additionally, butterfly wing mimetic structures have used to fabricate anatase titania photoanodes. Butterfly wing structures have also been made using layer-by-layer sol-gel-based deposition and soft lithography molding.  Gecko feet  Gecko feet are hydrophobic, but that is not the only property that assists in their self-cleaning nature. Estrada and Lin created polyproppylene, polyethylene, and polycaprolactone nanofibers using a porous template. These nanofiber geometries were shown to be self-cleaning in fiber dimensions of 5, 0.6, and 0.2 microns. However, a hydrophobic surface alone does not explain the perpetually clean toe pad of the gecko, even in dry environments, where water is not available for self-cleaning. This resulting fouling is a common problem for reversible adhesives modeled after the gecko toe pad. Digital hyperextension, or a movement of the toe with each gecko step, contributes to the self-cleaning. A surface or system that mimics this dynamic self-cleaning process has yet to be developed. = Hydrophilic biomimetic surfaces =  Snail shell  FE-SEM images of a hierarchical synthetically made ZnO film. The hierarchical structure of this particular film makes it more hydrophilic. Other biomimetic surfaces are created with similar structures to control wettability properties. Magnifications are (a) √ó800, (b) √ó20000, (c) √ó40000, (d) √ó80000. Snail shell is an aragonite-protein composite, with a hierarchical groove structure. The regular roughness of the structure creates a hydrophilic structure, a thin layer of water trapped on the surface, that doesn‚Äôt allow oil to attach to the snail shell, thereby keeping the shell clean. These surface properties of snail shell have inspired the use of similar surface patterns on ceramic tiles and ceramic structures by the INAX corporation, which applies these techniques to kitchens and bathrooms.  Fish scale  Fish scales are calcium phosphate composites coated with a mucus layer. Fish scale properties have been mimicked by polyacrylamide hydrogels, which are both hydrophilic and mimic the mucus‚Äô retention of water. Additionally, fish scales have been used as a template for a casting technique, and as a model for a lithography and chemical etching techniques on silicon wafers that exhibited oleophobic contact angles of oil in water of 163¬∞ and 175¬∞, respectively.  Shark skin  Molded and laser-ablated shark skin replicas have been fabricated, and shown to be oleophobic in water. The molded replicas use a negative made of polyvinylsiloxane dental wax and the positive replica was made of epoxy. These replicas have also shown that the structure of shark skin reduces the fluid drag caused by turbulent flow. The fluid dynamic properties of sharkskin have been mimicked in swimsuit, nautical, and aerospace applications. = Super hydrophilic biomimetic surfaces =  Pitcher plant  Wong et al. developed a surface inspired by the system on the pitcher plant. This surface, named ‚Äúslippery liquid-infused porous surfaces‚Äù (SLIPS) is a micro- or nano- porous substrate, with a lubricating liquid locked in place. For the system to work, the lubricating liquid must fully wet the substrate, the solid must be preferentially wetted by the lubricating substrate when compared to the repelling substrate, and the lubricating and encroaching liquid must be immiscible. Although the concept of SLIPS was biomimetic of the pitcher plant, it is not superhydrophilic with a contact angle of 116¬∞, though it does repel blood and oil.

The West coast is notably consistent, with big swells and high winds, whereas the east coast is dominated by cyclone season swells; the North island is notably warmer than the South, but less consistent; mean temperatures range from 7 ¬∞C to 20 ¬∞C, depending on location and time of year. Winter is more consistent than Summer, with a southeasterly swell. The climate of New Zealand is varied, so different surf conditions are encountered across the islands. History Surfing was a part of MƒÅori culture before the arrival of European settlers in the 19th century. The practice was called whakahekeheke, and was carried out using a variety of craft, including boards, or kopapa, and even bags of kelp (poha). The influence of Christian missionaries led to a noted decline in surfing. It was later revived following a tour of New Zealand by Hawai'ian surfer Duke Kahanamoku in 1915, when he gave demonstrations to locals. By the 1920s and 1930s, New Zealanders were surfing using solid wooden boards. Surfing was utilized in the Surf Lifesaving movement, which used heavy hollow longboards to paddle through the surf. Imported magazines in the 1950s contained plans for longboards, which were improved upon to incorporate features such as a rocker and fin. These boards helped attracted younger members to lifesaving. Up until this point, surfing consisted of riding the wave in a straight line perpendicular to the beach. In 1958, two American lifeguards, Bing Copeland and Rick Stoner, came to stay at Piha Surf Lifesaving Club and introduced the concept of surfing across the face of the wave on a smaller board. Copeland and Stoner also helped locals to make copies of their boards, introducing modern surfing and surfboards to New Zealand. These new surfing techniques put more emphasis on the surf conditions, causing surfers to go in search of better locations and conditions, resulting in a decline in the number of surfing lifesavers. In 1963 the first National Surfing Championships was held at Mt Maunganui, followed by the establishment of the New Zealand Surf Riders' Association. In 1966, New Zealand sent its first representative team to the World Surfing Championships in San Diego. By the late 1960s, more surfboard builders were setting up business, using improved technology which resulted in shorter boards. This allowed for greater speed in executing turns and cutbacks. Conflict between surfers and the New Zealand Surf Lifesaving Association over the safety of surfing in close proximity to swimmers was partially resolved by the introduction of \\"surf lanes\\" and leg ropes. Governing body Surfing New Zealand is the governing body for the sport of surfing in New Zealand. It was established in 1963, and is involved in the organization of competitions, the development of local training programmes and the education of surfing coaches and judges.  MƒÅori and surfing  Water sports were popular in MƒÅori culture, and considered important for ensuring children were comfortable in water. There are a number of modern surfing clubs and championships which cater to MƒÅori surfers. The Auahi Kore MƒÅori Titles, held since 1992, is a national surfing championship open to MƒÅori contestants in eight categories. The Auahi Kore Aotearoa MƒÅori Surfing Team compete in the Oceania Surfing Cup, an international surfing championship for indigenous nations of the South Pacific.  Culture  The practice of searching for better surf conditions led to the establishment of certain cities and towns as surfing centres, with a distinctive surfing culture. These include Raglan, Mt Maunganui and Gisborne. Raglan is particularly known for its consistent surf, and many people visit the small town to learn surfing from one of the local surf schools. Green Wave Raglan is currently the top-rated surf school in the country. RaglanManuBay Demographics In 1963 there were approximately 300 surfers in the country, but this number grew to an estimated 15,000 by 1967, and estimated 240,000 today.

In a partnership with the ASHRAE, the International Code Council (ICC), and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the NGBS was developed to provide a uniform national platform for recognizing and advancing green residential construction and development. To date, over 100,000 residential units have been certified green with the National Green Building Standard.  Rating System  The NGBS is a point-based system, wherein a single-family or multifamily building(s) can attain certification depending on the sustainable and green practices included in design and construction, and planned for its operation and maintenance. Projects can qualify for four certification levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Emerald) by earning the required number of points for each level. = ANSI-approved consensus = The 2015 edition of the NGBS is the third iteration of the NGBS, building upon the previous 2012 and 2008 editions. All editions of the Standard were developed by Consensus Committees of industry and nonprofit individuals, and in partnership with the ICC and NAHB. The 2015 edition of the NGBS introduced a new partner in the development process, ASHRAE. Staff of these three organizations did not serve as members of the Consensus Committee, and aided only in the facilitation of meetings. The NGBS remains the only residential-specific green building rating system to undergo the full consensus process and receive approval from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ANSI approval is critical as it serves as third-party confirmation of balance, representation, openness, consensus, and due process in the development process. The Consensus Committee that developed the 2015 version of the Standard was composed of 42 individuals representing a variety of government agencies, municipalities, home building industry stakeholders, and non-profit organizations, including but not limited to: * National Multifamily Housing Council * National Institute of Standards & Technology * Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships * Texas A&M; University * U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) * U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) * American Institute of Architects (AIA) * City of Des Moines = Green practice categories = Points are earned when a project complies with the numerous green building practices laid out within the Standard. These practices fall into six general categories: * lot design, preparation, and development * resource efficiency * energy efficiency * water efficiency * indoor environmental quality * operation, maintenance, and building owner education = Certification levels = Projects can qualify for four levels of certification by earning the required total number of points for each level: * Bronze: 231 Points * Silver: 334 Points * Gold: 489 Points * Emerald: 611 Points The NGBS was designed so that a project team must take a multifaceted approach to green building. It requires that a project achieve a minimum number of points in each green practice category to be certified, as well as earn a minimum number of additional points from any category it chooses. This prevents project teams from obtaining all of its points by focusing on a handful of categories, and ignoring other categories due to difficulty. A building‚Äôs highest rating depends upon the lowest threshold met by any of the six categories. For example, if a project missed the threshold for Emerald in one category by a single point, it will still only achieve Gold certification even if it reached the required number of points for Emerald certification in all other categories. Furthermore, for dwelling units greater than 4,000 square feet, the number of total points required to receive certification levels increases by one point for every additional 100 square feet. This makes it more challenging for larger dwellings to receive the same certification as smaller dwellings to account for the larger environmental impact of larger dwelling spaces.  Eligible Project Types  = Residential buildings = The NGBS was designed specifically for residential construction, development, and renovation. Eligible building types which can earn certification through the Standard include: * single-family houses * low-rise multifamily * high-rise multifamily * residential portions of mixed-use buildings * affordable housing * renovations of existing houses = Land development = Within the NGBS, and separate from individual buildings and renovations, a development can receive a certification for design and preparation in accordance with green practices. Similar to buildings, lane development projects can qualify for four different rating levels: * 1-Star: 95 points * 2-Star: 122 points * 3-Star: 149 points * 4-Star: 175 points For land development projects, points are not divided among separate categories, but are a total collection of varying practices, such as stormwater management, natural resource conservation, and planning.  Certification Process  Conformance with the NGBS is verified through construction documents, plans, specifications, inspection reports, and other data that demonstrates conformance with the points being pursued. All NGBS project teams must include a NGBS Green Verifier, who serves as an independent, in-field representatives of the NGBS Green certification system. Verifiers work with project teams to perform the rough and final construction inspections described below. To achieve certification, these inspection reports, along with relevant information regarding pursued practices, are provided to Home Innovation Labs for technical review and verification. Every project is subject to two independent and mandatory, third-party verification inspections. The accredited Verifier is responsible for the visual inspection of every green building practice in the building. The verifier must perform a rough inspection before the drywall is installed in order to observe the wall cavities in every apartment, and a final inspection of every apartment once the project is complete. The required verification imbues a high level of rigor, continuity, and quality assurance to the system and to the projects that are certified.  Designations  = Green Verifier = Home Innovation Labs qualifies, trains, and accredits building professionals to provide independent verification services for builders participating in our NGBS Green Certification program. Verifiers must first demonstrate they possess experience in residential construction and green building before they are eligible to take the verifier training. Most verifiers are also HERS Raters and/or LEED Accredited Professionals. Potential verifiers must complete thorough training on exactly how to verify every NGBS practice. After completing the training, verifiers must pass a written exam before receiving accreditation, and must have their accreditation renewed annually. Home Innovation Labs regularly audit Verifiers and the verifications they perform as part of our internal quality assurance program. NGBS Green Verifier accreditation is earned by individuals, and does not extend company-wide. = Certified Green Professional = The Certified Green Professional (CGP) designation is offered by the NAHB, and recognizes builders, remodelers and other industry professionals who incorporate green and sustainable building principles into homes. The required courses provide a background in green building methods, as well as the tools to reach consumers, from the organization leading the charge to provide market-driven green building solutions to the home building industry. CGP coursework is closely aligned with the ICC/ASHRAE 700-2015 National Green Building Standard, which includes chapters on energy, water and resource efficiency, indoor environmental quality, lot and site development and home owner education, and is the core curriculum for the required CGP classes. There are nearly 3,000 active CGPs in the United States working in all aspects of the high-performance home building and remodeling industry. = Green Certified Products = The NGBS Green Certified Product program bridges the gap between manufacturers who produce NGBS-certified products and the builders/designers who want to use them in homes. To be eligible for the NGBS Green Certified Products program, manufacturers must provide appropriate third-party evidence to Home Innovation Labs that their products meet the criteria for recognition in buildings seeking NGBS Green Home Certification. NGBS Green Certified Products earn a certificate that identifies the specific NGBS section(s) where points for the product are available. This information facilitates designers' selection of products to be used in green homes, and the approval of those points by Home Innovation-accredited green building verifiers.  Notable NGBS Buildings  = Salmon Creek Net Zero = The Salmon Creek Net Zero Home is a single- family house built in Vancouver, Washington. It earned an NGBS certification at the Emerald level, the highest available certification level. The home was built by Urban NW Homes in a neighborhood featuring only Emerald level homes, the first of its kind on the West Coast. Notable features of this home that helped it earn certification included: * staggered stud construction for reduced material consumption * triple-pane windows for increased energy efficiency and less heat loss * cork entry flooring, a highly renewable resource * refurbished interior doors, for reduced resource consumption * washing machine that waters the yard, allowing for reduced water consumption * lifebreath air purifier, for great indoor air quality = Norcross Remodel = The Norcross Remodel project is a single-family home remodel located in Dallas, Texas. It earned an NGBS certification at the Bronze level. According to the owners, as their family grew, they needed more space. Ferrier Builders completed the addition onto their existing home, withy sustainable and high- performance features, including: * new high-efficiency windows and doors * spray foam insulation in the walls & roof * ENERGY STAR kitchen and laundry appliances * solar tubes to aid with natural daylighting = Roxton = This is multifamily mixed-income remodeling project located in Denton, Texas. It earned an NGBS certification at the Emerald level, the highest available certification level. This urban, low-rise multifamily apartment complex consists of 16 buildings containing 126 residential units. The project was a gut remodel of a 1970s building, and green building practices helped lead to an estimated 63% savings in water compared to the original building.

Since 1991 she has been a member of the Berlin House of Representatives. In 2009 she became a member of the Senate of Berlin in which, between 16 October 2009 and 2011, she served as senator for Integration, Work and Social Affairs in the Red‚Äìred coalition administration of Klaus Wowereit. Carola Freundl was her married name. However, following the break up of her marriage she announced in 2005 that she was reverting to her maiden name.  Life  Carola Bluhm was born in East Berlin. Her parents were both lawyers. Despite spending her first two and a half decades in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), she grew up in an \\"open academic household\\" where \\"critical debate [on the issues of the time] took place every day\\". By her own account, she was encouraged to think for herself, an attitude of mind which later found its way into her political approach. She undertook a vocational education at school, passing her school leaving exams (Abitur) in 1982. This opened the way for a career in fruit and vegetable production, a valued profession in a country where, at least in the cities, fresh produce was usually in short supply. The experience was formative. After ten years at school in Berlin with the same classmates she was based in Brandenburg an der Havel, for the first time away from the capital and working with new colleagues. Ruefully she would look back on the apple harvest period when comrades started work sometimes as early as 04.00 in the morning each day, not taking time off at weekends, in order to harvest the apples with a teutonic determination to ensure that apples sorted and packed were of perfect quality, only to suffer the bitter experience of seeing their work become pointless as the fruit deteriorated in the crates because of logistical failures whereby the authorities were unable to arrange timely transportation to the shops. She joined the party in 1982 and became a candidate for local political office soon afterwards, but was never blind to the practical imperfections of the one-party East German state in action. Passing her Abitur and her \\"fruit gardening education\\" had opened the way to a university level education: between 1982 and 1987 she attended the Humboldt University of Berlin. Her mother was fiercely opposed to her subject choice, preferring that she should obtain a degree in something less politically charged, possibly involving landscape gardening. However, Bluhm picked Sociology which, consistent with the time and place, was taught through the prism of party approved Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. The teaching was nevertheless soundly structured and she emerged with a degree in 1987. Much of the focus of her studies involved the difficulties arising with the massive housing redevelopments that were a feature of East Germany in the 1980s. Older people whose children had left home were reluctant to relocate and lose all the friends and associations of the areas where they had brought up their families, while for younger people with children there was a resulting shortage of sufficiently large apartments. There was no attempt to avoid studying social issues and processes arising in the country, but any thought of discussing the interaction of such issues with the overall political structure of the country was a total taboo for academics involved in sociological or empirical social research work. Her daughter was born in 1985. East Germany had long suffered from a desperate shortage of working age population thanks to the slaughter of war in the 1940s and industrial scale emigration from east to west during the later 1940s and through the 1950s. The government was eager to encourage more children: supported by a flexible system and by her family Bluhm was able to combine intense study with motherhood. Her son was born in 1988 after she had concluded her undergraduate studies. Between 1987 and 1991 she was employed as a research assistant at the Institute for Socialist Economic Management at the Berlin Economics Academy (\\"Hochschule f√ºr √ñkonomie Berlin\\"). During the later 1980s the East German political establishment suffered a crisis of confidence as the winds of Glasnost blowing across from Moscow left old certainties looking less than certain, while intensifying industrial and commercial rivalry between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic made the future look less secure, highlighting the dire fiscal position of the savagely indebted East German economy. In university sociology departments there was little appetite for undermining the state by focusing on the increasingly stark dysfunctionalities of the socialist state, but nor was it possible to overlook objective facts. Someone in Bluhm's position might have been expecting to work towards a doctorate and pursue a university career as a sociology professor, but as academic career opportunities faded away Carola Bluhm switched to politics not necessarily by design, but in response both to her personal situation, as the mother of two very young children, and to national events. Matters came to a head after November 1989 when protesters breached the wall and it became apparent that the fraternal Soviet forces had no instructions to suppress the street protests by force, as they had in 1953 (and, more recently, in Prague in 1968). A succession of seemingly unstoppable events were set in train, leading to East Germany's first (and as matters turned out last) free and fair election in March 1990 and then, formally in October 1990, German reunification. At the hitherto important Berlin Economics Academy Carola Bluhm's career prospects disappeared. In 1990 she was informed succinctly in writing that she was being temporarily laid off (\\"in Warteschleife geschickt\\") and six months later, her job disappeared permanently (although according to her own website she remained, at least formally, an employee of the Berlin Economics Academy till early in 1991). Unemployment, hitherto a theoretical issue that she had researched and on which she had taught as an academic, became her personal reality. The old Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), hitherto the ruling party in the East German one-party dictatorship, now embarked on a sometimes uncomfortable relaunch for a democratic future, part of which involved rebranding itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). Bluhm was one of those who stuck with the party, becoming a PDS member during 1990. The switch to more active involvement in politics happened almost by accident that same year when an elderly longstanding friend from her local district became ill and asked her to attend a party meeting called to select candidates as his representative. She attended and was herself and spontaneously decided to apply for a candidacy on her own account. Her commitment to using the unfolding political changes as a chance to reform the German Democratic Republic from a left wing perspective but embracing emancipation and democracy in ways that, traditionally, the SED had not. There was talk of a \\"third way\\". Her ideas caught the mood of the meeting and she found herself selected as a PDS candidate for the city centre electoral district of East Berlin in the forthcoming city council elections - the first such elections to be held on a free and fair basis. The party's lead candidate was a man called Hans Luft, but Bluhm's second place on the party list turned out to be sufficient to ensure her election to the city council (\\"\\"). Following reunification, from January 1991 she became a member of Berlin's House of Representatives (\\"Abgeordnetenhaus\\"), now covering what had previously been both East and West Berlin. Working with city politicians who had cut their teeth with the very different socio-economic preconceptions and in the very different democratic context of West Berlin involved an intense learning curve for all concerned, and \\"very intensive debates\\" were not infrequent. Between 1995 and 2001 she chaired the PDS group in the Berlin House of representatives, jointly with Harald Wolf: then, in 2001, she became deputy chair. Between 2006 and 2009 she was herself chair of the PDS parliamentary group in the assembly. Directly before that, from 2004 and 1006, she was a member of the assembly's enquiry commission \\"A future for Berlin\\". between 2009 and 2011, she served as senator for Integration, Work and Social Affairs in the Red‚Äìred coalition administration of Klaus Wowereit, taking on the post following the retirement 0of the previous incumbent, Heidi Knake- Werner. At the 2011 local election the Red‚Äìred coalition lost its majority. The PDS went into opposition while city governance passed to a grand coalition of the SPD and CDU. Bluhm, with the other PDS senators, accordingly resigned her senatorial responsibilities. The party recovered its position in the 2016 state election and returned to city governance. Bluhm now returned, albeit briefly, to her position as chair of the party group in the assembly, this time jointly with Udo Wolf.

Santiago. Plot In a future in which war and cataclysm have destroyed society as we know it, the survivors scrape by and warriors, bandits, mutants, mercenaries, and thugs battle on the highways with people just trying to make lives for themselves caught in the middle. The only semblance of order is an organized militia called ‚ÄúThe ownership‚Äù which seeks to peacefully convert scattered settlements to stable governments loyal to them through use of gasoline and protection as incentives. Trace is a wanderer who once worked for The Ownership but has since left that life for one on the highways. He makes a stop at a small outpost where his sister and former traveling companion Arlie is staying with her current boyfriend, Bo. Trace arrives just in time to witness a prize fight set up between Bo and a local gang member, with Bo having bet the keys to Arlie‚Äôs car against the gang members. The gang member switches places with a more menacing and capable accomplice before the fight begins and Bo is quickly outclassed and defeated. Trace jumps in to recover his sisters car keys and defeats the gang member. The crowd erupts into a melee and in the ensuing chaos The trio escape to their vehicles. Gang members give pursuit but Trace in his car and Arlie in hers are able to defeat them. Just as things seem safe, Trace notices a group of vehicles approaching in the distance and they are identified as a band led by a dangerous man called ‚ÄúScourge.‚Äù After a brief argument, Arlie and Trace agree to split up and meet the next day 90 miles away. Before leaving Trace warns Arlie he does not trust her boyfriend, and Bo is just using her for whatever he can get. Most of Scourge‚Äôs men follow Trace, but some follow Arlie and Bo. Trace gets into a drawn out battle with the men who followed him and emerges victorious before heading on his way. Bo and Arlie stop to make out and are captured by scourages men. Bo betrays Arlie and asks to join the bandits. He is told he may, but only if he survives the initiation, and is then beaten and dragged behind a truck. Arlie is taken by scourge to be his sex slave. Trace shows up too late to stop it, but stops Bo being tortured. He questions Bo before shooting him. Back on the road trace sees a soaring bird of prey, and sees a commotion in the distance. He investigates and finds a mercenary being attacked and outnumbered by Scourge‚Äôs men. Her car is destroyed and there is no one left alive to question, but Trace and the mercenary are victorious. After a stand off in which she tries to steal his car, the mercenary introduces herself as ‚ÄúStinger,‚Äù and tells him she is also looking for Scourge. She also calls to her the bird of prey Trace saw earlier and he realizes it is her trained bird. The two join forces and continue on. When Trace and Stinger stop for the night, Stinger wanders off and falls into an entrance used by ‚ÄúThe Sand People,‚Äù a tribal society of subterranean dwelling cannibalistic mutated humans. Stinger meets a young woman named Spike, who was previously captured. Spike tells Stinger of their predicament, and explains that she can understand the sand people despite their strange language because Spike can read minds. Trace wakes and notices Stingers bird circling and Stinger gone. He follows the bird to find the entrance. Inside he saves the two women in the nick of time and they make an escape, in part due to the discovery the mutants fear fire. Stinger, Spike, and Trace leave together and find an Ownership fuel convoy that was attacked and left. It is being scavenged by cave man like humans in cloths carrying crude club like weapons. There is one survivor, a small man who speaks through babbling and hand signs. Spike user her mind reading to communicate and they discover that he is a ‚ÄúTrue believer,‚Äù part of a peaceful commune building a make shift Rocket they believe will take them from the plights of the Earth. Returning the man to his camp they are welcomed warmly and Spike is delighted by the people‚Äôs happy thoughts. In the camp the Ownership ambassador meets the group as well. He and Trace are old acquaintances. The ambassador tells Trace the convoy was a fuel supply for the Believers Rocket, and that the Ownership wishes to supply the fuel to gain allegiance from the believers. Trace is non pleased. He speaks with Stinger and discovers she is working for the Ownership to kill Scourge. The two fight, and then make love. Trace decides to leave to find his sister. Meanwhile, Scourge has decided to attack the True Believers camp as part of his plan to destroy the Ownership and ensure his personal philosophy is the only governing power. Scourge‚Äôs men attack and destroy the True believer camp, killing the leader of the believers, the Ownership Ambassador, and many others. Trace returns to find Stinger and the Ownership forces plotting a retaliatory strike on Scourge. Trace notices his sisters locket around the neck of one of Scourge‚Äôs dead men- taken from her after Scourge allowed his men to use Arlie as a sex slave as well. In a rage, Trace ignores Stingers requests for him to wait for the Ownership forces and a joint strike. Trace has Spike use the locket and her powers to find Arlie and Trace leaves alone to get her. He goes to Scourge‚Äôs fortress and finds Arlie, battered and traumatized by her ordeal. He is captured trying to rescue her however and is tainted by Scourge. Trace manages to escape with Arlie and the Ownership forces advance on Scourge. While escaping Trace sees Stingers bird and realizes that the Ownership is on the move, and heading straight into a trap set by Scourge that will wipe the entire force out in one blow. Trace has no way to earn the Ownership forces in time, and a firefight breaks out between Trace and Scourge‚Äôs men. Arlie rushes to detonate the trap early and save the Ownership forces. She is shot in the heart, but manages to push the detonator and the trap is disarmed. Scourge prepares for a battle and the Ownership forces advance and over power Scourge. His forces retreat to the fortress under fire. Trace follows Scourge, but Scourge manages to make it to his car and speed off. Trace takes Arlie‚Äôs car which was seized when she was Algiers and once again chases Scourge. Stinger leads the Ownership troops in claiming the fortress. Stinger is knocked from the fortress ramparts by Scourge‚Äôs second in command after she shoots him. Spike finds Stinger as she is dying and comforts her in her final moments. Trace crashes Arlie‚Äôs car into Scourge by jumping it of a cliff after exiting the vehicle and landing it on Scourge. Trace meets up with Spike who informs him of Stingers death. Trace gives Spike his sisters locket and leaves her to rebuild a better society before driving off in his own car into the wastes. We see Stingers bird soar overhead and the credits roll.

While at BofA she became introduced to a very young software company focused on people management. She saw enough value in the software that she joined the company, PeopleSoft, as its 9th employee. Following PeopleSoft, Zecher joined Oracle as Senior Vice President in 1977 with responsibility for building Oracle's Application business in Public Sector, Higher Education, Healthcare, Telecommunications, Financial Services and the Utilities markets. She tendered her resignation in March 2002 to become CEO of Evolve Corporation. Evolve Corporation, an enterprise professional services automation software company, was a publicly traded company controlled by Private Equity firms. The company had gone through difficult times following the dot com boom. During a one-year time frame, she stabilized the company, sold the assets and took the liabilities through a bankruptcy. = Microsoft = Zecher joined Microsoft in 2003 to lead the US Public Sector organization which focused on government, education and health customers. Within 3 years, she grew the revenue from just under $1B to $2B. The catalyst for growth was an extensive reorganization resulting in 40% more customer-facing employees. Accompanying the realignment was a focus on accountability and customer satisfaction. Her success in the US Public Sector led to her being named Corporate Vice President of Microsoft's Worldwide Public Sector organization. The worldwide business unit had over 2,000 employees serving government, education and health customers in over 100 countries. Under her leadership the business experienced double digit growth each year rising to over $10B. She resigned from Microsoft in September 2011 when she was recruited to lead Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt = Zecher was named President, CEO and Director of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH), a global education and learning company in September 2011. With origins dating back to 1832, the company is among the world's largest providers of Pre-K‚Äì12 education solutions and one of the longest-established publishing houses. Within six months of joining HMH, Zecher led the company through a pre-pack bankruptcy resulting in a successful financial restructuring in which $3.1B of debt was eliminated and converted to equity. The company emerged 32 days later. HMH deepened their market penetration by acquiring the culinary and reference portfolio of John Wiley & Sons that included Webster's New World Dictionary and CliffsNotes. Zecher engineered a successful IPO in 2013. Several leading news organizations have interviewed her about her success, family focus, and leadership style. Using mobile applications for consumer markets and leveraging brand awareness of Curious George, Carmen Sandiego and The Polar Express Zecher began to move HMH to an e-business. HMH launched Curious World in 2015 as interactive education subscription software curated by early education experts and aligned to eight key learning areas. Zecher resigned from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt on September 2016 after a wave of disappointing earnings announcements and greater than 50% decline in the stock price. = The Barkley Group = Zecher launched a boutique consulting firm, The Barkley Group, in 2017. The firm focuses on Digital transformation across industries, Educational consumer interests, and business strategy  Board activity  Zecher has previously served on the U.S. State Department's Board for Overseas Schools, The Emily Couric Leadership Forum, James Madison University Board of Visitors, the Tandem Friends School Board, Cradles to Crayons Board, and the Intelligence and National Security Association (INSA) Board. Zecher currently is a member of the Hasbro Corporation Board where she serves on the Audit committee and Chairs the Cyber Security committee, The Tenable Corporation Board where she serves on the Nominating and Compensation committees, the John F. Kennedy Foundation Board where she serves on the Finance and Technology committees, and the Chesapeake Maritime Museum Board.

In addition to running the orphanage, she was also active in the temperance movement. Clarke was born in Luce, Township, Indiana. Her father, Dr. William T. Everton, was a physician and her mother was Martha Everton. Sources differ on whether she was of English or Irish heritage.S Clarke was educated at Xenia College. After Clarke's first husband Lee Eckols died in 1894, she married Rev. Alan G. Clarke in 1896; divorced in 1898. Of her spouse, she stated, \\"My husband wore himself out trying to dominate me, and I am still on top of the sod.\\" Clarke had a daughter named Nora with Eckols in addition to two stepchildren. Clarke was reportedly a devout member of the Church of Christ. According to the U.S. Census for 1900, she was operating an orphanage with five children in 1900. This was the first orphanage run by a member of the Church of Christ in Texas or other Western states. A 1918 article written by C.L. Edson in American Magazine gave a very flattering account of Clarke's efforts to provide a strict, but loving home for the boys in Belle Haven. In the article, Edson noted that it was unusual for a woman at that period in history to run a dormitory that had boys. Also, Clarke only accepted children who didn't have any living parents, or \\"true orphans.\\" Some of the boys in her orphanage were described as the \\"toughest cases\\" and Clarke insisted on them obeying her rules. However, she claims to have never dismissed a boy from Belle Haven for violating her rules. She stated, \\"If I can't win a boy's confidence and show him the right road in life to travel, I'm a failure with that boy.\\" Clarke's goal was for the children under her care to become self- sufficient. She expected the boys to care for their living quarters and assigned them tasks such as washing the dishes. Belle Haven was located on 50 acres of land. Domestic sciences, music, art, and farming were taught to both girls and boys. The boys were responsible for the farm work. In addition, there was a store on the property that opened July 20, 1922 to help raise funds. In November 1921, Belle Haven was incorporated with the goal of it continuing for another 50 years. Belle Haven was purchased for $15,000 and Jennie Clarke, along with the Rev. George M. Rance, J.P Hook, C.F. Dye, and Nora Levy were appointed as life directors. Clarke's health began failing in the 1920s; she died in 1929, Belle Haven closed in 1930. It is speculated that Clarke's efforts inspired the Tipton home in Tipton, Oklahoma and the Boles Home in Quinlan Texas, both operated by Church of Christ members. Following Clarke's death, the Luling Signal praised her efforts for working with children.

De Solla Price, first published in 1963. The book presents the 1962 Brookhaven National Laboratory Pegram Lectures, a series of lectures dedicated to discussing science and its place in society. Price's goal in the lectures is to outline what it may look like for science to be analysed scientifically, by applying methods of measuring, hypothesizing, and deriving to science itself. With this goal in mind, he sets out to define quasi-mathematically how the shape and size of science has shifted from \\"small science\\" to \\"big science\\" in a historical and sociological way. Price presents a quantification of science as a measurable entity via an analogy to thermodynamics, conceptualizing science like a gas with individual molecules possessing individual velocities and interactions, a total volume, and general properties or laws.  Prologue to a Science of Science  Price begins the lectures by setting forth a demarcation in science centered around the modern period. He describes the phenomenon that, at the time of the lectures, 80 to 90 percent of important scientific work had occurred in one normal human life span. With this facet in mind, he sets out to describe the development of the term \\"Big Science,\\" as coined by Alvin M. Weinberg in 1961. As a general directive, he seeks to show that the transition from \\"Little Science\\" to \\"Big Science,\\" specifically the socio-economic and methodological changes to science in the 20th century, have been mostly gradual. To illustrate this point, he presents empirical statistical evidence from various aspects and fields of science, all of which show that the mode of growth of science is exponential, growing at compound interest. This assertion Price claims is the \\"fundamental law of any analysis of science,\\" stating that it even holds accurately over long time periods. With this fundamental law in mind, he states that for general measures the size of science in manpower or number of publications doubles in size every 10 to 15 years. If this rate of expansion is considered broadly, then from the 1600s until now such size measures of science have increased by a factor of 106. From this observation, Price moves to describe the \\"coefficient of immediacy:\\" the number of scientists alive compared to the number of scientists who have ever been, a ratio or percentage he states as 7:8 and 87.5% respectively. This measure serves to show numerically how the majority of important science has taken place within the average human life span at the time of the lecture presentation. As a result of the consistent exponential growth rate and immediacy of science, the statement that the majority of scientists throughout history are alive at any given moment must be consistent throughout history as well, meaning that in 1700 the majority of all scientists ever were alive, true also for 1800 and 1900 and so on. As a result of this facet, Price states that science has been constantly exploding into the population, increasing its size at a rate faster than the increase of total humans able to conduct it. However, Price asserts that this exponential growth rate cannot simply explain the transition from \\"Little Science\\" to \\"Big Science,\\" as the constant growth would not make the modern period under question any more likely to produce \\"Big Science\\" than any other. He conjectures that two statistical phenomena hold true for science generally, that individual metrics of science may grow at rates different from that of the exponential growth, and that the exponential growth rate may be starting to diminish. In response to his second point, he claims that the normal exponential growth may give way to a logistic growth rate, growing exponentially until it reaches a maximum size and then ceasing to grow. The possibility that science follows a rate of growth modeled by a logistic curve is suggested further by the fact that if science had continued to grow at an exponential rate in 1962, then by now there would be more scientists than people. With his claim that the growth rate actually observes a logistic curve, he provides a second basic law of the analysis of science, namely that the exponential growth rates previously mentioned must be in fact logistic. If this claim is correct, then the exponential growth rate previously observed must break down at a point in the future, and Price implies as a conclusion to this section that the onset of this breakdown may be associated with an upper bound to the size of science brought on by \\"Big Science.\\"  Galton Revisited  In this chapter, Price suggests various ideas and methods about conducting a science of science, or scientometrics, by first narrating some peculiar contributions to statistics made by Francis Galton. His overall goal is to further the possibility of applying scientific methods to science itself by suggesting various metrics and measures of the size, growth rate, and distribution of science. He focuses on Galton's work concerning the distribution of high achieving scientists and statesmen in the upper echelons of British society, specifically Hereditary Genius and English Men of Science. These works are reviewed with the goal of understanding a basic metric for the number of people or papers in science that reach different levels of quality, an idea basic in Price's formulation of scientometrics. Further, he suggests that understanding such a metric would allow predictions to be made of science and scientists when changes associated with Big Science arrive. Galton's original approach was to estimate the distribution of high achieving practitioners of science among the eminent parts of British society, and Price takes this as a starting step in grasping a scientific metric of the productivity of science. In analyzing Galton's work and the work of another statistics researcher, Alfred J. Lotka, Price suggests that there may be a rough inverse-square law of productivity. Price moves next to define a quantity he calls someone's \\"solidness\\" s, as the logarithm of the total papers published in one scientist's life. Keeping in mind the previous productivity law, for each unit increase in a scientist's solidness, the total number of scientists of that solidness decreases at a constant rate. With these two observations, among others, Price asserts that the foundations for an econometric-like study of science have been suggested, with the analysis of time series suggesting exponential or logistic growth and the distribution law of scientific productivity comprising them. He concludes by suggesting that these distributions and analyses contain errors relating to the non-uniform distribution of scientists across populations, noting that they tend to congregate in certain fields, institutions, countries, and journals. In keeping with his gas analogy, he maintains that just as one cannot measure the exact positions and velocities of gas molecules, one cannot pinpoint the exact productivity or contribution levels of individual scientists within science.  Invisible Colleges and the Affluent Scientific Commuter  This chapter serves multiple purposes but overall achieves the same goal as the previous, providing a further conception of the productivity measure in science. This conclusion is reached through defining historically, sociologically, and from a communications perspective what a scientific paper is for, specifically what the purpose of this form of scientific communication is. To begin this analysis, he begins by looking at the history of the scientific paper, tracing its original purpose to discovering what was of interest within scientific practice. With the emergence of this scientific social practice, seen not as a means of publishing new knowledge but of communication between practitioners, the process of situating papers within the general body of literature came in to play. Specifically, each scientific paper is built from the foundation created by all previous papers, and with this facet exists a possibility of quantifying this foundation, the citation of references. With the idea that scientific papers were a social device of scientific communication, Price suggests that the driving force behind their emergent usage was the ability to assert and claim intellectual property within science. The possibility of communicating priority in disputes over scientific discoveries promoted the scientific paper as the best means of communication, leaving the information dissemination quality of papers as incidental in their overall purpose. With the quantification of scientific productivity by citation number and rate, there arrives a metric in science that gives the scientific importance of an individual's work or journal as its total usage within scientific practice, its total citations or references in other papers or journals. With this in mind, Price observes the fact that the total number of scientific references at a specific date across science is proportional to the total literature available within science at that date. Moving from the ability of scientific papers to facilitate communication and interactions between scientists, Price outlines an idea that allows further maximization of interactions between scientists. His term for this organizational method is the \\"invisible college,\\" specifically the circuit of institutions, research centers, journals, and conferences that allow intermingling and interactions within specific fields of science. Groups of scientists naturally form as a result of collaborations between individuals focusing on similar problems, but the ability for researchers to move around the globe in order to achieve interpersonal relationships with their fellow researchers is what Price suggests maximizes the group size able to keep up regular productive interactions. Thus Price defines the sociological structure of scientific practice communicating through published papers.  Political Strategy for Big Scientists  The final section of the lectures focuses on a larger-picture analysis of science and the monetary trends within it. As a general first statement, Price proposes that the cost of science has been increasing proportional to the square of the number of scientists. He points out that the cost of research in terms of the GDP did not increase in the years preceding World War II, yet afterward began increasing at the rate previously mentioned. As research amounts increase, the current and necessary number of researchers increases, promoting the inducement of scientists with higher salaries and better facilities in turn increasing the overall costs of science. Price suggests that it is this feedback loop that is a potential decelerator for the growth of science, and the main difference between Little Science and Big Science. What follows is his analysis of the \\"explosion of science\\" within non-developed countries, specifically Japan. He shows through this analysis that the United States' lack of experience of this explosion of science within the 20th century up to this point is due to the saturation of society with the activities of science, nearing costs not maintainable by the country. In countries where science has not yet reached an exponential growth curve, this saturation is not present, which allows the growth rate to set out at an exponential pace. The final conceptual measure that Price offers is the idea of the \\"mavericity\\" of a scientist, or the likelihood that an individual will test new and unique combinations of theories and experiments unexpected in the current literature. The reactions and interactions within science to this mavericity also characterizes Big Science over Little Science, where the former serves to limit and restrain the most maverick investigators due to collaborative work and specific directed goals for scientific research. Thus the emergence of Big Science not only influences the growth rate, connectedness, and significance of science, but also the individual facets of the scientific pursuit.

He was shot in the back of the head while riding in the front passenger's seat of a vehicle driving away from officers that attempted to stop it. He was unarmed during the encounter. Oliver was fired from the department and arrested on May 5, 2017. On August 28, 2018, he was found guilty of murder.nypost.com: White cop found guilty of murder for killing unarmed black teen On August 29, 2018, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Incident According to initial reports, the officers were responding around 11:00 p.m. to a 911 call \\"reporting several underage kids drunk walking around\\" at a party of approximately 100 people. Upon arrival, the officers allegedly heard gunshots, which created panic and caused party- goers to flee. Officer Roy Oliver fired three rifle rounds into a vehicle, striking Edwards in the head and killing him. Oliver was reportedly armed with a Modern Carbine MC5 rifle. Along with Edwards, the car contained two of Edwards's brothers and two friends. Edwards's 16-year-old brother was driving the car. Lee Merritt, a lawyer for Edwards's family, said Oliver shot through the front passenger side window. Edwards was pronounced dead at a local hospital. According to police, Edwards's brother was held in police custody overnight for the purpose of questioning him as a witness. Police originally said there was an \\"unknown altercation with a vehicle backing down the street towards the officers in an aggressive manner\\". After reviewing body cam footage, Police Chief Jonathan Haber later admitted that the vehicle was not moving toward the officers, but rather away from them. Haber said he \\"misspoke\\", saying, \\"I was unintentionally incorrect yesterday when I said that the victim's vehicle was backing down the road.\\" A later statement by the police department said, \\"The vehicle then pulled forward as the officer continued to approach the vehicle giving verbal commands. The vehicle continued [on] the main roadway driving away from the officer as an officer shot into the vehicle striking the passenger.\\" Oliver was fired from the police department as a result of the shooting. He had been a member of the Balch Springs Police Department for six years. Victim Jordan Edwards was a 15-year-old boy who lived in Balch Springs, Texas. He was a first-year student (freshman) at Mesquite High School where he played football. Aftermath Oliver, the officer who killed Edwards, was placed on administrative leave following the shooting and fired on May 2, 2017. Chief Haber said Oliver's behavior \\"did not meet our core values\\". The Dallas County Sheriff's Department and the Dallas County District Attorney's Office conducted an investigation into the shooting. On May 5, 2017, Oliver was charged with murder and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He turned himself into police later that day and was released after posting $300,000 in bail. On May 3, 2018, Oliver's murder trial was postponed for a second time and was rescheduled to begin August 20. On August 28, 2018, Oliver was found guilty of Edwards's murder. On August 29, 2018, Oliver was sentenced to 15 years in prison. His attorneys stated they intend to appeal both the sentence and guilty verdicts. Responses A vigil was held at Edwards's school on the evening of May 1, 2017. A lawyer for Edwards's family demanded the arrest of Oliver. Public and media reaction compared Edwards's death to the killings of other young black children by police officers. Reactions also noted the discrepancy between the original police account of the incident stating that the vehicle carrying Edwards had backed up aggressively toward the officers, and the body cam video showing the vehicle pulling away from the officers. Thousands of people began using the hashtag #jordanedwards on social media in response to the shooting. The American Civil Liberties Union's division in Texas tweeted, \\"We need answers. @BalchSpringsPD should immediately release footage of #JordanEdwards shooting. #BlackLivesMatter\\". Shaun King published an article in the New York Daily News calling for the arrest of Oliver. A local protest rally was postponed at the request of Edwards's family.

The estate lies on the eastern shore of Loch Fyne, and the house is located close to the village of Cairndow. Dating back to the 14th century and originally a Campbell property, the estate now covers more than of rolling hills and landscaped parkland. The centre of the estate was Ardkinglas Castle until this was replaced by a new house in the 18th century. This house was itself replaced by the present Ardkinglas House in the early 20th century, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer for Sir Andrew Noble. It remains the property of the Noble family, and is open to the public on a limited basis. The 18th- century woodland gardens are open all year round. Estate history =Ardkinglas Castle= Ardkinglas Castle is thought to date from the 14th century. It was built in the form of a quadrangle around an inner courtyard measuring in each direction. There were large turrets on three of the corners, to the front there was a large gate tower with two flanking defensive turrets. By 1769 the castle was reported destroyed. On 23 March 1679, Colin Campbell of Ardkinglas was made a baronet. His son Sir James Campbell, 2nd baronet, (died 1752) sat in the Parliament of Scotland from 1702 and, following the Union of Scotland and England, in the Westminster Parliament until 1741. He purchased the Dunderave estate around 1700, and was succeeded by his grandson, Lt.Col. Sir James Livingston-Campbell, son of his eldest daughter Helen. =The first Ardkinglas House= During the 18th century the Campbells commissioned designs for a new house at Ardkinglas from some of the leading architects of the day, including Colen Campbell, Robert Adam and James Playfair. None of these designs were built, and the house constructed in 1795 has been described as \\"rather dull\\". This house was destroyed by fire in 1831 and, despite further designs from architects including William Burn and Alexander Binning, the family moved into the stable block which was adapted as the main house. In 1810, when Sir Alexander Livingston-Campbell died, Ardkinglas was inherited by his cousin James Callander of Craigforth, who subsequently changed his name to Campbell and adopted the style of a baronet, although he was not entitled to do so. =The present house= In 1905 Ardkinglas was purchased by Sir Andrew Noble, an expert on ballistics and gunnery who was chairman of Lord Armstrong's artillery works in Newcastle. Ardkinglas House was designed by architect Sir Robert Lorimer, and construction began in May 1906. Although Noble's deadline for completion of 1 August 1907 was not met, the house was fully completed in 21 months. The house was lit with electricity powered from a hydro-electric plant on the estate. John Noble inherited the estate in 1972, and began farming oysters in the loch. In 1988 he opened the first Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, now a national chain. The house has been used as a filming location for television series, including The Crow Road and films including The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep. It is open to the public, although not on a regular basis. The house's original \\"Butler's Quarters\\" can be rented out. Ardkinglas Gardens The Woodland Gardens, dating back to the 18th century, are open year round with views of the exterior of Ardkinglas House and its backdrop onto Loch Fyne. The Arboretum was planted in the 1860s-70's by the Callander family and has some specimens of large trees. One of these trees a Grand Fir (Abies grandis) held the record for many years as \\"The Tallest tree in Britain\\", another tree a Silver Fir (Abies alba) is described as the \\"Mightiest Conifer in Europe\\" with a trunk girth of over . Ardkinglas Railway The Ardkinglas Railway was a narrow gauge estate railway built to serve the Ardkinglas Estate, former seat of Sir James Campbell, 2nd Baronet, of Ardkinglass, on the shores of Loch Fyne. The railway ran along the shore of the loch from a boat house at Caspian. The railway was built as a transportation system for the estate and as a garden toy for the estate's 17th Laird, George Livingston-Campbell-Callander. A single steam locomotive operated the line; rolling stock consisted of a two seat open passenger carriage and several wagons. The railway had been dismantled by 1897 and the equipment sold. The boiler from the locomotive was still in situ on the beach at Tayvallich on Loch Sween until the early 1950s.

It is part of the pedestrian and bicycle Bow River pathway that links a vast network of urban parks on both sides of the river. Baker Park is situated across the river from Bowness Park east of the Bearspaw Water Intake Pump Station. With its river observation point overlooking the Bow River and Bowness Park and its archways and arbours, it is the \\"most popular\\" park in Calgary for outdoor weddings. History Baker Park is named after Dr. Albert Henry Baker (1883‚Äì1953), the director of a tuberculosis (TB) sanitorium located on the same site from 1920 to 1979 and demolished in 1989 by Alberta Public Works. The federal government's Soldiers' Civil Re- establishment Department constructed the first buildings in 1918. Established in 1919 for returning World War I veterans who suffered from TB, the Central Alberta Sanatorium as it was then called, was typical of its era, \\"isolated, treed and divided into many separate buildings.\\" It was \\"downstream from the old Alberta Ice Company warehouse\\" (now the Shriner's storage area for antiques). In 1916 Dr. A. H. Baker served on a medical advisory committee investigating the prevalence of TB among Canadian indigenous populations and in 1917, as a member of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps, he served in China. In 1918, following a diagnosis of TB he was discharged‚Äîthough he never required hospitalization. He came to Alberta where he served as Medical Superintendent of the Central Alberta Sanatorium from 1920 to 1950 and as the Alberta Department of Health's director of the tuberculosis division. When Baker retired in 1950 after thirty years of service, the sanitorium was renamed the Baker Memorial Sanatorium in his honour. The site was nearest what would become the village of Bowness and eventually many Bowness villagers worked at the Sanitorium. By 1962‚Äîas more accommodations for TB patients were created elsewhere‚Äîthe Sanitorium was gradually converted to the Baker Center for the Services of the Handicapped. One of the legacies of the Baker Centre that is part of Baker Park, is the stand of 1,800 mature trees planted by gardeners from the former sanitorium. Features Unlike most Calgary parks Baker Park's \\"old-fashioned formality\\" with its \\"geometrical walkways\\" and \\"arrow-straight\\" tree-lined avenues, reflects its history as a World War I sanitorium. Along with the riparian native plants and shrubs, Alberta author Terry Bullick noted that the list of family trees include White Spruce, Green Ash, Colorado Spruce, Manitoba Maple, Lodgepole Pine, Bur Oak, Scots Pine, Aspen, Douglas Fir, Larch, Poplar, May Day Tree, Paper Birch, Mountain Ash, Weeping Birch, Hawthorn, Manchurian Elm, and Flowering Crabtree. Along with the usual picnic areas and pathways, Baker Park also has and a disc-golf course. Its promenades, archways, arbour, grass amphitheater, and river observation point make it a prized area for wedding photos. The Baker Park section of the Bow River Pathway runs through rows of trees past the former sanitorium site to a large river observation point. It also features a wildflower mount and a sun bowl in the middle of the park. The park is maintained by the city of Calgary Recreation Department.

Individual patients may have leftover medicines at the end of their treatment. Health care organizations may keep larger amounts of drugs as part of providing care to a community, and may have unused drugs for a range of reasons. Causes Various circumstances may cause a consumer to have unused drugs. The consumer might find that their medication is ineffective and quit taking it. The medicine might be effective, but the consumer might not adhere to their treatment and fail to take it for any reason. A patient might die, leaving their medications behind. A patient might move, such as from a hospital to their home, and somehow leave their unused drugs behind with the health care provider. Some medical professional practices lead to patients having unused drugs. Physicians may prescribe more than they should. Physicians and patients might see each other less often than they should, and the physician might agree to prescribe medication for a longer period of time than is best. The physician might neglect to review what medications a patient already has, and recommend more. The medical office might have confused records about what drugs a patient has, especially for offices without full computer records. Also a physician might provide drugs inappropriately in unnecessary health care. Scope of the issue Many consumers store unused drugs. Many health care organizations come to acquire large amounts of unused drugs. Responses Consumer organizations recommend that individuals be thoughtful about their unused drugs. Storing unused drugs at home can be a safety hazard. Drug disposal is often the right choice for consumers. Some regions offer government or nonprofit programs for the collection of unused drugs. Governments and organizations can have larger stockpiles of drugs than any consumer and a different set of concerns. With large supplies of drugs, drug pollution and negative environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products becomes a concern. Also, drug recycling might be a possibility. Collection Collection of unused drugs, also called drug return or drug take-back, is any program for individual consumers to dispose of drugs by returning their unused drugs to a collection center. One survey of consumers found that individuals like the idea of pharmacies accepting drug returns. Drug return programs can reduce the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Various research projects have investigated drug return programs at pharmacies in particular regions. Studied places include the United States, Britain, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Serbia, and Germany. Leftover opioids People in the United States tend to store unused opioids if any remain unused after medical treatment. Keeping unused opioids is a dangerous because it they become a risk for misuse.

With a crew of three and twin jet engines, it featured a tailless swept-wing layout and heavy armament. An order for three prototypes was received just weeks before the war ended. History During 1944-45, under its chief designer Richard Vogt, Blohm & Voss evolved a tailless wing layout through a series of studies. The ≈†koda-Kauba SK SL6 was the straight-winged SK V6 modified with twin tailbooms on the wing tips, each with a separate fin and outboard horizontal stabilizer. It was built to verify the control characteristics of the configuration.Zdenek Titz and Jaroslav Zazvonil; \\"Kauba's Dwarfs\\", Flying Review International, November 1965, pages 169-172. The first B&V; project to feature the outboard tail was the P 208, a single-engined fighter with pusher propeller, swept wings allowing much shortened tail booms and with downturned outer stabilizers in place of tail fins. The next study, the P 209.01, used the same wings and was jet powered. The P 212 saw further evolution of the design through three iterations, with the wing being more steeply swept, the tailbooms eventually eliminated altogether and small fins with rudders placed at the junction of wing and stabilizer. In January 1945 a requirement for a night fighter with crew of three was issued. B&V; developed a twinjet variant of what had to date been a single-engined single-seater. The resulting P 215 design was heavily armed and would have been a formidable opponent.Sharp (2015), pages 80-81, 84-87. An order for three prototypes was awarded on 17 March 1945, but the war ended just a few weeks later, before any significant detail design work could be begun.Pohlmann (1982), pages 190-193. Design The P 215 featured a main wing of constant chord and moderate sweep, with small landing flaps forming rear root fillets. Stub tailbooms at the wing tips supported tapered outboard tail surfaces. The horizontal stabilisers and attached elevators were angled downwards both in incidence and, more sharply, in anhedral. The neutral or negative angle of incidence provided longitudinal stability and, in conjunction with the anhedral, contributed to directional stability. Small vertical fins added to the directional stability and supported rudders. The thin, high-speed wing was unsuited to Vogt's trademark single tubular main spar, which in these designs was replaced by a broad wing box which shared the tubular construction's use of steel and doubling-up as fuel tankage. The short fuselage carried twin Heinkel HeS 011 jet engines set low to the rear, with the large cockpit located at the front of the main wing junction. The pilot and navigator sat side by side, with the radio/radar operator immediately behind them and facing rearward. A single engine air intake at the nose fed a steel duct which formed the structural spine of the craft. It passed beneath the cockpit and between the main undercarriage wells, before running under the main wing box and dividing to feed the two engines. This structural system allowed large removable panels to be cut in the duralumin skinning, allowing easy maintenance. A single nosewheel retracted beneath the front of the duct. Several armament options were proposed, with the main armament clustered around the nose intake and comprising a mix of heavy 30 mm or cannon with or without rockets. An unusual feature was a further pair of 30 mm cannon set either side of the rear fuselage and pivoting more than 90¬∞ to fire either rearwards or upwards. Provision was also made behind the cockpit for a single rearward-facing 20 mm gun with up to 50¬∞ elevation, and for two 500 kg bombs beneath the fuselage.Cowin (1963), October, page 316. Avionics included a comprehensive all-weather radio navigation suite and the advanced FuG 244 target acquisition and gun-laying radar. The first iteration of the design, the P 215.01, formed the basis of the brochure which accompanied the proposal. Following an initial assessment of competing designs, a revised specification was issued, with greater focus on a three-man crew, better armament and greater endurance. The revised P215.02 was therefore significantly larger and incorporated a number of refinements, including a higher aspect ratio and revised cockpit canopy.Sharp, Dan; Luftwaffe: Secret Wings of the Third Reich, Mortons 2017, pp.82-89.

This would happen through a specialized pharmacy or medical organization which would oversee and mediate the process. It is traditional to expect that consumers get prescription drugs from a pharmacy and that the pharmacy got their drugs from a trusted source. In a drug recycling program, consumers would access drugs through a less regulated supply chain and consequently the quality of the drugs could be lower. Advocates and opponents of drug recycling programs differ in judging the risk of the less regulated supply chain lowering the quality of drugs which reach the consumer. Various regional governments in the United States offer drug recycling programs. As of 2010, Canada had fewer drug recycling programs than the United States. Various organizations and governments are experimenting with different ways to manage drug recycling programs. Many drug recycling programs only take drugs from professionals, and never from patients. Drug recycling programs are not designed to be useful for consumers seeking to dispose of drugs. These programs also are not intended to lessen the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Typically they only accept medication which has not expired and which is in unopened packaging. When re-using recycled drugs, they only go to specific pharmacies which are prepared to address the special requirements of participating in a recycling program. Usually, drug returns happen without financial compensation. SIRUM, an acronym for \\"Supporting Initiatives to Redistribute Unused Medicine\\", is a nonprofit organization which advocates for drug recycling.

Academician of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences (1947). Hero of Socialist Labour (1965). Twice winner of the USSR State Prize of the first degree (1946, 1949).  Life  V. Gel'freykh was born on March 12 (24th), 1885, in St. Petersburg in the family of a civil servant. He graduated from the real school, and studied in private drawing school for two years. In 1906 he entered the Architectural Department of the Imperial Academy of Arts, which he graduated with honours in 1914, having completed the thesis project of the building of the State Council under the supervision of Professor Leon Benois. Even while studying at the Academy, he started to work in the studio of Academician Vladimir Shchuko, who had a significant influence on the further creative path of Gel'freykh. Beginning in 1918, Gel'freykh was the permanent co-author of Vladimir Shchuko; their cooperation continued until the death of Shchuko in 1939. The first cooperation work of architects after the October Revolution was the design and construction in 1922‚Äî1923 of the pavilions of the Foreign Department of the Russian Agricultural and Handicraft Exhibition in Moscow. During the 1920s, architects were working on projects in Petrograd ‚Äì Leningrad ‚Äì Smolny Propylaea, the monuments of Vladimir Lenin (near the Trinity Bridge, the Revolution Bridge and the Finland Railway Station), the Moscow-Narva Culture House. Shchuko and Gel'freykh took part in a number of competitions, including the draft of the Soviet pavilion at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, the project of the Ukrainian industrial building in Kharkov, the Palace of Labour in Ivanovo, the House of Councils in Tula, and several others. The design of the Palace of the Soviets played an important role in cooperative activity of architects: they participated in the first and second closed competitions for the Palace project (1932‚Äì1933, co- authored with Alexandr Velikanov, Leonid Polyakov, Igor Rozhin, G. Selyugin, Selyakova-Shukhaeva, Alexandr Khryakov, Georgy Shchuko, and others). The project executed by architect Boris Iofan, was adopted as a basis. Later Boris Iofan, Vladimir Gel'freykh and V. Shchuko with their architectural team were entrusted with the subsequent development of this project (1933‚Äî1939) In 1918‚Äî1935 Gel'freykh taught in the Leningrad Higher Artistic-Technical Institute (Russian –í–•–£–¢–ï–ò–ù ‚Äì –í—ã—Å—à–∏–π —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç). He taught in the Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry (1959‚Äì1967). Since 1935, the architect actively participated in the reconstruction of Moscow, he developed a version of the layout of the south- west of Moscow (1935‚Äî1937). His significant work during the war years were the constructions of the third stage of the Moscow metro ‚Äî the ground vestibule and the platform of the Elektrozavodskaya station (the project of 1938, opened in 1944, co-author Igor Rozhin), the ground vestibule of Novokuznetskaya station (1943). Gel'freykh created the project of the platform of the station \\"Botanical Garden\\" (now \\"Prospekt Mira\\", 1949, co-author Michail Minkus, sculptor Georgy Motovilov); the project of the Pantheon ‚Äì the Monument to the Eternal Glory of the Great People of the Soviet Land on the Lenin Hills (1954, co-author Michail Minkus, competition). In 1957‚Äî1958 Vladimir Gel'freykh took part in architectural competitions for the project of the Palace of Soviets on the Lenin Hills (co-author Michail Minkus). In the 1950s he developed a project for the reconstruction of the Smolenskaya Square (together with Pavel Shteller, Viktor Lebedev, with the participation of V. Zhadovskaya and A. Kuzmin).

The Leningrad avant-pop experimenter Sergey Kuryokhin was their regular collaborator. Six of Strannye Igrys songs featured in a 1986 split double album Red Wave which also featured Aquarium, Kino and Alisa. The band was formed in 1980 by the singing guitarist Alexander Davydov and bass guitarist Viktor Sologub, soon joined by the latter's brother Grigory (guitars), Alexey Rakhov (saxophone), Nikolai Kulikovskikh (keyboards) and Alexander Kondrashkin (drums). In 1982 they became part of the Leningrad Rock Club.

Born in Saint Lucia, she lives in New York City. Early life Ross was born in Castries, Saint Lucia, a country in the Caribbean. She lived her earlier years in the Caribbean and grew up speaking a mixture of English and French patois. It wasn't until she was ten years old when she moved to the United States, arriving first in Virginia. She attended Pennsylvania State University and began writing poetry, focusing on a nostalgia for the past, geography and the languages and voices she left behind. She moved to New York and received her Master of Fine Arts degree in poetry from New York University (NYU). Career * She was nominated for a Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowship when she was studying poetry at NYU. * She taught Creative Writing at NYU, and also taught high school English at the Student Center program in New Orleans. * She was a member of the Nommo Literary Workshop at the Student Center in New Orleans. * She received second place in the Katey Lehman Creative Writing contest * She served as the managing editor of Calabash, a NYU publication. * Her work has appeared in Prairie Schooner, Caribbean Beat, the Caribbean Review of Books, Calabash: A Journal of Caribbean Arts and Letters, Poetry International, Kalliope, and online journals such as M√©lange and Timbooktu. Analysis Sassy Ross's poems hinge on the echoes of a past she left behind in the Caribbean. She remembers the landscapes of St. Lucia, and explores the central themes of home in relation to her departure, and return. She balances the dichotomies of hyphenated slaves dives into her mother-daughter relationship, and mother-father relationship .Among many themes that arise throughout her poetry, displacement, language, conflict, and trauma arise from the perils of the island and her past. Her conversational poem between a brother and a sister, displacement is clearly evoked through language. While the sister speaks in English, her brother speaks in a St. Lucian dialect. Ross intentionally displaces the brother and sister not only by language, but by distance as well. In the poem, the sister is returning to the Caribbean for her brother that she left behind and plans on taking him back with her to the U.S. It is in the brother's voice, in Ross's poem \\"Brother to Sister\\", where a sense of memory of the Caribbean is revealed. Conflict is revealed through the separation of their family and the traumas that resulted in effect. The brother's pained memory of his sister is of her leaving when he was a young boy. He writes: He remembers his sister's urgency to leave, but doesn't fully understand why. The space between them is not only physically wide, from the United States to the Caribbean, but their ability to connect is also further distanced by their different upbringings, and clashing of cultures. The sister's response to her brother, in Ross's poem \\"Sister to Brother\\", shows how nostalgia becomes a place of remembering the struggles that came with the conflicts of being in St. Lucia. She is aware of her reason to return, which she writes, She revisits the landscape of the island and admits the need to revisit its beauty, but ultimately has returned for her brother. She speaks of the pains that accompanied her anxieties of leaving her brother and the years they have wasted being apart from each other when she writes: Her poetry life reveals the perils of her childhood. She doesn't stroll down memory lane as a means to glorify her childhood memories, but explores the complexity of her past and how it was marked by the need to survive. References to the drug culture in the Caribbean arise, as her memory is shaped by her father and his addiction. \\"The Rottweiler\\" is a poem where she and her mother, \\"searched parking lots where one \\"Could trade turntables for a fix,\\" for her drug addict father, she later describes as \\"a thief who had his own set of keys\\" (\\"The Rottweiler\\"). Her relationship with her father, and her feeling of connect/disconnect with him is shown in her poem \\"History Shelves\\". Her skepticism in feeling a part of him but apart from him at the same time, and she is infatuated by his words and capability to convey, she reveals, (\\"History Shelves\\"). Furthermore, her liberation in her voice and language is seen at the end of the poem, where she is able to find her own understanding of identity and self without the burden of her father validating it for her through his rendering of words, she has found her own lyric. At the end of \\"History Shelves\\" she writes: Excerpts from her poems are taken from Coming Up Hot an anthology of Caribbean poets where Sassy Ross appears.

Site history During the Late Preclassic, Guayt√°n was densely populated, although buildings were generally of perishable materials. At the time, the site had contacts with the Guatemalan Highlands and with the Pacific coastal lowlands. Guayt√°n was one of two sites (the other being La Vega de Cob√°n, in Zacapa) that controlled most of the trade passing along the Motagua River. In the Early Classic, the city underwent a population explosion and there was contact with the great metropolis of Teotihuacan, in the distant Valley of Mexico. By the Late Classic, contacts extended to the Pet√©n lowlands, the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. =Modern history= The site was first reported in 1926 by archaeologist Gustavo Espinoza, although no serious investigations were undertaken until 1943.

They were record- setting four-time Raw Tag Team Champions and one-time SmackDown Tag Team Champions, making their team overall five-time champions in WWE. The duo were originally in a feud together from July to September 2016, but after a Best of Seven series culminated in a tie, the two were forced to work as a team by then-Raw General Manager Mick Foley. \\"The Bar\\", originally an informal nickname until they joined SmackDown in 2018, originates from their catchphrase: \\"We don't just set the bar, we are the bar!\\". The team was forced to disband in April 2019 due to Sheamus suffering an injury and Cesaro being drafted to Raw.  History  = Feud and formation = Cesaro (right) wrestling with Sheamus On the July 19 episode of SmackDown Live, Cesaro and Sheamus were drafted to the Raw brand in the 2016 WWE draft, being the last two televised picks for the brand. The two men started a feud shortly after the draft. Cesaro defeated Sheamus in two consecutive matches, resulting in Cesaro earning a match for the United States Championship, which he received on the August 8 episode of Raw against Rusev, but lost after interference from Sheamus. Both men had issues about being on Raw, with Cesaro saying he would have more opportunity on the SmackDown brand, and Sheamus having been in a career slump since The League of Nations dissolved. Raw General Manager Mick Foley then announced that the pair would face each other in a best-of-seven series with the winner to receive a future championship title match. Sheamus won the first match at SummerSlam. Sheamus would defeat Cesaro in the second and third matches, but Cesaro defeated Sheamus in the fourth, fifth, and sixth matches, tying the series 3-3. At Clash of Champions, Cesaro fought Sheamus to a no contest when neither man could continue, leaving the outcome of their best-of-seven series undecided. Since Foley did not want to insult the impressive effort and performance the two had in the seventh match, and because he did not want the two to potentially injure themselves from an extra eighth match, he decided to reward both men with a championship match in the form of an opportunity at the Raw Tag Team Championship. = Raw Tag Team Champions (2016‚Äì2018) = Cesaro and Sheamus defeated Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) in a non-title match on the October 24 episode of Raw, and defeated them by disqualification at Hell in a Cell, but did not win the title. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Cesaro and Sheamus were announced as part of Team Raw for the 10‚Äìon‚Äì10 Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match at Survivor Series on November 20, 2016, which Team Raw won. Cesaro and Sheamus were the sole survivors for their team, and for this reason, Foley gave them a title opportunity the following night on Raw. On Raw, however, Cesaro and Sheamus again failed to capture the tag titles from The New Day following interference from Xavier Woods. After a scripted bar fight on the November 28 edition of Raw where they initially spoke of their apparent split as a tag team, the two men finally began to co- operate, reforming their team. They lost to The New Day in a triple threat tag team match on the December 12 episode of Raw also involving Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. They received another title shot after winning a fatal four way #1 contenders match at Tribute to the Troops and at Roadblock: End of the Line, Cesaro and Sheamus defeated The New Day to win the Raw Tag Team Championship, marking Cesaro's second reign and Sheamus' first reign. In winning the title, they ended New Day's record setting reign of 483 days. They then retained the title against New Day in a rematch on the December 26 episode of Raw, ending their feud. On January 16, Cesaro and Sheamus announced their participation in the Royal Rumble match. Before that match, however, they were scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against Gallows and Anderson on the Royal Rumble pre-show, where they lost the titles, ending their reign at 42 days. The duo then began to show tension between each other and were both later eliminated from the match by Chris Jericho. Their championship rematch was sabotaged by Enzo Amore and Big Cass, who interfered and caused a disqualification loss for the pair. Cesaro then defeated Enzo before he and Sheamus were defeated by the duo the week after to become the number one contenders to the title. At Fastlane, Cesaro defeated Jinder Mahal. It was later announced that Cesaro and Sheamus were to compete for the Raw Tag Team Championship against Enzo and Cass and Anderson and Gallows in a triple threat ladder match at WrestleMania 33. At the event, however, the match was made a four-way ladder match when the returning Hardy Boyz were added, who won the match. The Bar as Raw Tag Team Champions at WrestleMania 34 At Payback, they were defeated by The Hardys, and attacked them after the match, turning heels in the process. They began calling themselves by the collective nickname The Bar, stating \\"We don't just set the bar, we are the bar!\\", and their entrances became further synchronized, wearing the same attire to the ring. They regained the titles at Extreme Rules in a steel cage match and defended them in a 30-Minute Iron Man match against The Hardy Boyz at the Great Balls of Fire pay-per-view. During the Summer, The Bar started a feud with Seth Rollins, who allied with his former stablemate Dean Ambrose. At SummerSlam they lost the titles against Rollins and Ambrose and lost the rematch at No Mercy. Cesaro and Sheamus aligned with The Miz as a result of the continuing feud with this eventually resulting in the reunion of the Shield when Rollins and Ambrose re-aligned with Roman Reigns. At TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs, the team of The Miz, Cesaro, Sheamus, Braun Strowman and Kane lost to Ambrose, Rollins and Kurt Angle, who replaced Reigns due to Reigns being removed from the match on medical grounds, in a five-on-three Handicap Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. On the November 6 episode of Raw in Manchester, England, Cesaro and Sheamus defeated Ambrose and Rollins following a distraction from their former rivals The New Day to win the titles. By winning this match, it set them up to face SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos in a champions vs. champions match at Survivor Series. Cesaro and Sheamus lost the match. Cesaro and Sheamus then lost the Raw Tag Team Titles to Rollins and Jason Jordan on the Christmas episode of Raw. They had their rematch at the Royal Rumble, where they regained the titles, becoming record four-time champions as a team and marking an individual record fifth reign for Cesaro. After Braun Strowman singlehandedly won a tag team battle royal for a Raw Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania 34, Cesaro and Sheamus were scheduled to defend the titles as long as Strowman found a partner. After weeks of failed attempts of finding out who Strowman's partner was, Cesaro and Sheamus walked into WrestleMania clueless. At the event, Strowman chose a 10-year old fan named Nicholas as his partner and they defeated Cesaro and Sheamus for the Raw Tag Team Titles. = SmackDown Tag Team Champions (2018‚Äì2019) = The Bar as SmackDown Tag Team Champions in January 2019 On April 17, as part of the Superstar Shake-up, Cesaro and Sheamus, now officially known as The Bar, were traded to SmackDown. Despite the trade, they still had an opportunity to win the Raw Tag Team Championship as they faced Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt at the Greatest Royal Rumble, but failed to win the Raw Tag Team Championship. They entered a brief feud with The New Day, losing to them and failing to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match. After going on a hiatus, the duo returned in late-July to take part in a No. 1 Contenders Tournament for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, beat The Usos to advance to the finals, where they lost to The New Day. After failing to become number one contenders again, the duo finally were gifted a title match. At Super Show-Down, The Bar failed to win the title. At the 1000th episode of SmackDown on October 16, The Bar defeated The New Day to capture the titles with unlikely help from Big Show. They subsequently retained the titles against The New Day at Crown Jewel and Starrcade. On the November 27 episode of SmackDown Live, The Bar and Big Show's brief alliance ended after a confrontation backstage. They later entered a feud with The Miz and Shane McMahon, culminating in a match at the Royal Rumble on January 27, where The Bar lost the SmackDown Tag Team Championship to Miz and McMahon. The following SmackDown they lost a number one contenders match to The Usos. The Bar defeated Kofi Kingston at Fastlane in an impromptu 2-on-1 handicap match. The team then lost to New Day, DIY, The Hardy Boyz, and Aleister Black and Ricochet over the next two months on SmackDown. At WrestleMania 35 in April, The Bar lost to The Usos in a match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championships. At the Raw following WrestleMania, The Bar interrupted a Winner Takes All match between Seth Rollins and Kofi Kingston, resulting in a tag team match. This resulted in \\"bullshit\\", \\"AEW\\" and \\"CM Punk\\" chants from the crowd, voicing their displeasure in the match they were given instead. The next day on SmackDown, Sheamus suffered a concussion in a six-man tag team match with New Day. Cesaro was drafted to Raw a few weeks later and started competing as a solo performer. Cesaro stated in a later promo that The Bar had broken up due to Sheamus having to take the time off.url=https://twitter.com/WWE/status/1163220083780521984?s=20 Sheamus returned to action in 2020 and resumed his career as a singles wrestler. = Reunion (2020‚Äìpresent)= On the October 16, 2020 edition of the season premiere of SmackDown, the team reunited with Shinsuke Nakamura to face the New Day in a farewell match which they lost.

Other notable works of this group are cantata Hinemoa, opera Tapu, his most popular song Waiata Poi and two String Quartets (No. 1 and No. 2).

History The IWDG was founded in December 1990 to establish a cetacean stranding and sighting scheme, and to campaign for the establishment of a cetacean sanctuary. In June 1991, the Irish Government responded by declaring Irish Waters to be the first European whale and dolphin sanctuary. The group was granted a charitable status in December 1999. Organisation The IWDG is a Limited Company with charitable status. It is guided by a number of officers, of which Dr. Simon Berrow is the current Acting CEO, who are overseen by a Board of Directors. The charity is a member of, and funded by, the Irish Environmental Network. Current activities =Stranding and sighting scheme= One of the main activities carried out by the IWDG is the collection and storing of reported cetacean sightings and strandings in Irish waters. The complete database of reports is disseminated through the IWDG website. The main objective of this scheme was to ensure that cetacean stranding reporting was done in a geographically uniform and objective manner. Part of the scheme involves training a network of local observers through both training workshops and the provision of identification material. In the case of humpback whales, the group maintains a catalogue of fluke identification photos in order to distinguish between individuals. =Cetacean welfare= The IDWG lists the importance of engaging with external groups and promoting responsible whale watching in its mission statement. To this aim, it has released a document outline guidelines to be followed by groups who may come in contact with live cetaceans, such as fishermen, whale-watching groups and research vessels, in order to better safeguard the wellbeing of the creatures. As part of these guidelines, the group advises against swimming with cetaceans. =Cetacean conservation= The IWDG has been involved in the collection of biopsy samples from stranded large baleen whales since 2003. They have also applied for a licence to attach tracking tags to fin whales in order to determine their distribution outside of Irish waters. Outreach Whale Watch Day at Galley Head Lighthouse, Co. Cork, in August 2004. One of the stated objectives of the IWDG is to promote Ireland's suitability for observing cetaceans. In addition to engaging with the press, the group organises workshops to train members of coastal communities in the identification of cetacean species and reacting to live strandings. As part of these outreach activities, the group organises an annual Whale Watch Day to promote land-based whale watching, with the assistance of volunteers. Vessels =RV Celtic Mist= RV Celtic Mist is a 56ft steel-hulled ketch, donated to the IWDG in 2011 by the Haughey family. The vessel underwent an EU-sponsored refit, before being relaunched in August 2012. It is used for training members in cetacean identification and monitoring, and for research projects, including the use of acoustic survey techniques. On its maiden voyage, the research vessel encountered 11 cetacean species, including blue whales. =Other vessels= Prior to obtaining use of the RV Celtic Mist, cetacean surveys were carried out by IWDG members onboard the Marine Institute's RV Celtic Voyager and RV Celtic Explorer ships for many years.

Born in Yeovil, Somerset, Chant was the daughter of James Chant, a merchant captain involved in the Asian spice trade, and Elizabeth Rowe Wills; she was one of nine children. She claimed that before she was seven she had sailed the world as one of her father's passengers. With her family she immigrated to the United States in 1873, settling in Hawley, Minnesota, with numerous other Yeovil residents; upon her mother's death, her father moved the family to Minneapolis and opened a market. She early displayed a taste for art, but was encouraged to turn her talents elsewhere, so she enrolled in the Training School for Nurses at Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children and graduated in 1886. She continued taking art lessons, studying with Douglas Volk between 1890 and 1893 and receiving instructions in the evenings from Burt Harwood. The outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898 saw her transferred by the American Red Cross to the American South, where she worked in Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. She was discharged in 1899 and returned to Minneapolis, becoming active with the Handicraft Guild and the Minneapolis Art League and creating murals and decorative paintings as well as pottery and prints. During a two-year sojourn in England beginning in 1901 she traced her family's relationship to King Arthur and his court, with the result that much of her work became focused on medieval legends. The tour also provided fodder for a series of feature articles for the Minneapolis Journal. A decade later she moved to Springfield, Massachusetts for work, remaining for six years at a firm that specialized in various interior fittings and furnishings. Chant long had a reputation as an eccentric ‚Äì in later years she dressed in an outr√© manner and claimed to talk to \\"spirits\\" ‚Äì and in July 1917 concerns about her well-being led members of her family to have her arrested and committed to the Minnesota Sanitarium. Later in the year she was transferred to the Rochester Hospital in Rochester, where she underwent treatment for manic depression, a condition which may have been exacerbated by the deaths of several family members and a close friend. On her release in 1920 she began a trip to China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines, all of which she had visited in childhood; upon her return to the United States she settled in Wilmington, North Carolina, forswearing nearly all ties with her family. In Wilmington Chant first attempted to establish an art colony; when prevented by limited finances and poor health, she turned her attention instead to supporting the local artistic community. In 1923 she established the Wilmington Art League, which later led to the creation of the Wilmington Art Association. She was also active in promoting the creation of the Wilmington Museum of Art, which opened in 1938 and which was the forerunner of the town's current museum. She taught design, painting, and batik, both in her own studio and at the museum; pupils included Claude Howell, Henry Jay MacMillan, Helen MacMillan Lane, Hester Donnelly, and Joe Nesbitt. She encouraged her pupils to look to the wider world for influence; her own work was informed by the Arts and Crafts Movement, the work of the Pre-Raphaelites, and the art of William Morris. Chant died in Wilmington and is buried there in Oakdale Cemetery.

This theory has implications for the development of political science as well as other secular worldviews.

Born in 1706, he ruled over various domains in the Jodhpur and Marwar states and was a major political force during his life.  Early life and political ascension  Maharaja Bakht Singh at the Jharokha window of the Bakhat Singh Mahal, Nagaur Bakht Singh was born on 16 August 1706 as the second son of Ajit Singh. At the time of Bakht's birth his family was in active revolt against the Mughal Empire due to an ongoing territorial dispute over Gujarat.N.S. Bhati, Studies in Marwar History, page 6 His father was pardoned by Muhammad Azam Shah in 1708, granting the Rathore clan control over the Kingdom of Marwar and the city of Jodhpur.Munis pp. 316Richards pp. 180‚Äì181 In 1724 Bakht Singh and his elder brother Abhai Singh plotted to kill their father and usurp his position as Raja. They succeeded, and Abhai Singh became the Maharaja of the Kingdom of Marwar and Jodhpur. This abrupt change of leadership sparked a brief civil war among the Rathore in Marwar, during which the brothers employed Maratha soldiers to fight their enemies. At this time Marwar was a vassal of the Mughal Empire, which was in constant conflict with the Maratha Empire. The allowing of Maratha soldiers onto Mughal territory to solve a domestic dispute effectively estranged the Rathore from the Mughal government.Gupta, Bakshi pp. 152‚Äì155 = Siege of Ahmedabad = In 1730 a taxation depute against Sarbuland Khan (Nawab of Gujarat) resulted in Abhai Singh laying siege to the city of Ahmedabad.Google Books 2015, pp. 256‚Äì257. Bakht Singh personally led the storming of the city, the Marwar army lost 120 soldiers and 700 were injured while Sarbuland Khan lost his son in the cannonade and most of his men were slaughtered along with high ranking Mughal Mansabdars (nobles), some ranking as high as 3,000. Sarbuland Khan surrendered after three days of fighting, after which the Mughal emperor was forced to make Abhai Singh the lord of Ahmedabad and the governor of Gujarat.Visheshwar Sarup Bhargava,\\"Marwar and the Mughal emperors (A. D. 1526‚Äì1748)\\", page 153 Bakht Singh was commended for his bravery during the battle.  Lordship and Battle of Gangwana  Bakhat Singh rejoices during Holi, Nagaur c. 1748‚Äì50; 44.1 x 65.1 cm. Mehrangarh Museum Trust By 1739 Bakht Singh had been appointed lord of Nagaur. Seeking to expand his influence, he attempted to force concessions from the Bikaner State, calling on his brother for support. The Raja of Bikaner sent a letter to Jai Singh II, the powerful Maharaja of the Kingdom of Jaipur, requesting assistance. Jai Singh sent a letter to Abhai Singh asking for leniency to be shown to Bikaner, a request Abhai sharply refuted. Seeking to end the conflict, Jai Singh dispatched his minister Vidyadhar to Bhakt Singh. Bakht agreed to withdraw his men from the conflict if he were paid by Jaipur and given the town of Merta. This was done, and with Bakht Singh now removed as a threat, Jai Singh was able to force a peace with Marwar. Unable to face Jaipur alone, Abhai Singh was forced to sign a treaty with Jai Singh. The Kingdom of Marwar was forced to pay 1 lakh (100000) rupees to the Mughals, 20 lakh (2000000) to Jaipur, give up hostages, and was prohibited from sending emissaries to the Mughal court without the express approval of Jai Singh. The latter condition effectively made Marwar a vassal of Jaipur, as Abhai could no longer request aid from the Mughal government. The treaty enraged many members of the Rathore clan, most of whom felt that Bakht Singh was responsible for the disaster. In 1741 Abhai Singh began to gather his forces in Jodhpur in preparation for a war of revenge against Jaipur. Jai Singh detected these movements and gathered his army (of 40000-100000 men) to invade Marwar.Sarkar pp. 200 As the Jaipur army advanced, Bakht Singh arrived at Merta, the forward camp for the Rathore and Marwar army. He entered the Raja's durbar, where he was chastised by his fellow Rathors for his betrayal. Bhakt accepted his wrongdoing, and promised to lead his personal cavalry contingent (of 1000 men) against the oncoming Jaipur. In the ensuing Battle of Gangwana Bakht Singh and his cavalry Of 1000 Rathores succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Jaipur army. Over 12000 Rajputs and Mughals were killed, losses so high that Jai Singh ended the campaign and was forced to accept a mediated peace with Abhai Singh. Bakht Singh, wounded by both a bullet and an arrow during the fighting, was once again praised for his valor. Jai Singh never recovered from shock suffered from losses of this battle and died 2 years later.  Later life  On 17 June 1749 Abhai Singh died, with his eldest son Ram Singh succeeding him. Bhakt Singh (his uncle) disagreed with this primogeniture and rose up in revolt. Bakht Singh emerged triumphant in the battle of Luniawas, becoming the Maharaja of Marwar and Jodhpur in July 1751. Bhakt Singh's first step as a ruler was to raise an army in Ajmer and to start fortifying his holdings to protect Marwar from external threats like the Mughals, Marathas and Afghans. However, not much was achieved, due to his sudden death on 21 September 1752. According to Persian historians, he died by cholera while Vir Vinod claims that he was poisoned by Madho Singh I.Rajasthan Through the Ages By R.K. Gupta, S.R.

She was a member of the feminist group Acci√≥n Feminista Dominicana (AFD) that helped secure suffrage for women in the Dominican Republic in 1942 under dictator Rafael Trujillo. She served as a senator from her home province from 1942-1944 and also as governor of both Monte Cristi and Santiago. A number of foreign journalists referred to her as a celestina, or madam, for Trujillo during the regime.  Early life  Isabel Mayer was born on February 7, 1885 to a wealthy land-owning family in the Monte Cristi province of the Dominican Republic. Her parents were Emilio Mayer and Virginia Rodr√≠guez. She attended Welgelegen School in Cura√ßao. In 1909 she was crowned the queen of carnival in Monte Cristi. She married Manuel Tav√°rez Ramos and had one child, Carmen Isabel Tav√°rez Mayer, in the early 1910s but soon divorced and never remarried. In the 1920s Mayer became very involved with the incipient feminist movement, becoming the President of the local \\"Club de Damas.\\" By the 1930s she was involved in the national movement for women's rights as a founding member of Dominican Feminist Action (AFD) and active participant in the collective's gatherings and events. She had also become very close with Rafael Trujillo, the leader who would become dictator from 1930 - 1961 through her prominent social connections in the northwest province of her birth.  Political career  After Rafael Trujillo moved to grant women the vote in 1942, he designated Mayer one of the first senators for her provincial home of Monte Cristi. She would later serve as the governor of Monte Cristi province and neighboring (and more politically significant) Santiago de los Caballeros. In the late 1940s she became head of the \\"Dominicanization of the Border\\" committee and she worked exhaustively through the next decade to demonstrate her loyalty to the dictator and his party, the Partido Dominicano (Dominican Party, or Trujillo's main party).  Conflict with Rafael Trujillo  In 1960 Mayer fell into disfavor with the Trujillo regime as a result of her extended family's resistance activities. Manolo Tav√°rez Justo, the son of her ex- husband, had become a key leader in the resistance activism against the dictator. As was a standard tactic of the regime, Mayer found her name on a list of individuals \\"invited\\" to form their own party due to their apparent dissatisfaction with the reigning Partido Dominicano. Mayer responded indignantly that she had no interest in joining any new political collective and would remain, until she died, a loyal follower of the \\"enlightened\\" policies of dictator Rafael Trujillo. She was written up in an infamous section (\\"El Foro P√∫blico\\") of the nation's main newspaper, El Caribe, as a detractor, and even briefly jailed. Despite her denials, she was fired from her political post and became persona non grata to the regime. Death and legacy Mayer died in 1961 in Monte Cristi not long after falling from favor in the regime's eyes. Her legacy as a pioneering feminist and early female politician has been largely overshadowed by the many foreign journalist reports that she was a celestina, or madam, for the dictator. As a result of foreign reporters being led to her house in their travels across the country, she was described in multiple English publications variously as a madam, wheel-horse, adventuress, harridan, octaroon, and celestina. The label of celestina, or procuress, has been the most long-lasting and is included in many, if not all, Dominican publications that mention her role in the dictatorship.

Teachers and students are in an equitable relationship and listen to multiple points of view.  History  Although modern interest in dialogic pedagogy seems to emerge only in the 1960s, it was a very old and probably widespread educational practice. Perhaps one of the best known examples of dialogic pedagogy in the Ancient times is the Socratic method described by his student Plato. However, dialogic practices and dialogic pedagogy existed in Ancient Greece, before, during, and after Socrates' time, possibly in other forms than those depicted by Plato. There has been a long tradition of dialogic pedagogy, called Chavruta/Chavrusa/Havruta, in Jewish Yeshivas, involving dialogic studies of Talmudic texts, that goes back to the eras of the Tannaim (Rabbis of the Mishnaic period, 10-220 CE). Economist Amartya Sen argues that dialogic pedagogy has been well situated within the Indian religious and civic traditions and spread across Asia with the rise of Buddhism. In more recent times, Mikhail Bakhtin introduced the idea of dialogism, as opposed to \\"monologism\\", to literature. Paulo Freire's work, Pedagogy of the Oppressed introduced these ideas to educational theory. Formats  There are a number of formats of instruction, that have been recognized as \\"dialogic\\" (as opposed to \\"monologic\\"). * Interactional: Dialogue involves a high student-teacher talk ratio, short utterances/turns, and interactive exchanges. * Question-answer: Dialogue involves either a teacher asking students questions and eliciting answers from the students or students asking questions and eliciting answers from the teacher and/or one another.Matusov, E., Bell, N., & Rogoff, B. (2002). Schooling as cultural process: Shared thinking and guidance by children from schools differing in collaborative practices. In R. Kail & H. W. Reese (Eds.), Advances in Child Development and Behavior (Vol. 29, pp. 129-160). New York: New York: Academic Press. * Conversational: Instructional dialogue is modeled after natural mundane everyday conversations.Echevarria, J., Silver, J., & Hayward, D. (1995). Instructional conversations: Understanding through discussion (video). Santa Cruz, CA: Regents of the University of California. * Without authority: Dialogic guidance occurs among equal peers as authority distorts dialogic processes. Jean Piaget was the first scholar who articulated this position. Types There are a number of types of dialogic pedagogy, that is, where the form and the content is recognized as \\"dialogic\\". * Paideia: Learning through asking thought-provoking questions, challenging assumptions, beliefs, and ideas, that involves argumentation and disagreements. This notion comes from Socratic dialogues described and developed by Plato. * Exploratory talk for learning: Collective mindstorming and probing ideas, enabling \\"the speaker to try out ideas, to hear how they sound, to see what others make of them, to arrange information and ideas into different patterns\\" (p. 4). * Internally persuasive discourse: Bakhtin's notion of \\"internally persuasive discourse\\" (IPD) has become influential in helping conceptualize learning. There are at least three approaches to how this notion is currently used in the literature on education: # IPD is understood as appropriation when somebody else's words, ideas, approaches, knowledge, feelings, become one's own. In this approach, \\"internal\\" in IPD is understood as an individual's psychological and personal deep conviction. # IPD understood as a student's authorship recognized and accepted by a community of practice, in which the student generates self- assignments and long-term projects within the practice. # IPD is understood as a dialogic regime of the participants' testing ideas and searching for the boundaries of personally-vested truths. In this approach, \\"internal\\" is interpreted as internal to the dialogue itself in which everything is \\"dialogically tested and forever testable\\" (p. 319). The map of the existing dialogic pedagogy approaches  Instrumental  Curricular space of conventional (monologically manipulative) education. Instrumental dialogic pedagogy uses dialogue for achieving non-dialogic purposes, usually making students arrive at certain preset learning outcomes. For example, Nicolas Burbules defines dialogue in teaching instrumentally as facilitating new understanding, \\"Dialogue is an activity directed toward discovery and new understanding, which stands to improve the knowledge, insight, or sensitivity of its participants\\". The teacher presets the endpoint of the lesson, for example, \\"At the end of the lesson, the students will be able to understand/master the following knowledge and skills.\\" However, the teacher's method of leading students to the endpoint can be individualised both in instruction techniques and in time taken. Different students are \\"closer\\" or further\\" from the endpoint and require different strategies to get them there. Thus, for Socrates to manipulate Meno to the preset endpoint - what is virtue is not known and problematic - is not the same to manipulate Anytus to the same endpoint. It takes different and individualized instructional strategies. Socrates, Paulo Freire and Vivian Paley all strongly critique the idea of preset endpoints however in practice they often set endpoints. Instrumental dialogic pedagogy remains influential and important for scholars and practitioners of dialogic pedagogy field. Some appreciate its focus on asking good questions, attendance to subjectivity, use of provocations and contradictions, and the way it disrupts familiar and unreflected relations. However, others are concerned about the teacher's manipulation of the student's consciousness and its intellectualism.  Non-instrumental  In contrast to instrumental approaches to dialogic pedagogy, non-instrumental approaches to dialogic pedagogy view dialogue not as a pathway or strategy for achieving meaning or knowledge but as the medium in which they live. Following Bakhtin, meaning is understood as living in the relationship between a genuine question seeking for information and a sincere answer aiming at addressing this question. Non-instrumental dialogic pedagogy focuses on \\"eternal damn final questions\\". It is interested in the mundane only because it can give it the material and opportunity to move to the sublime. This is seen, for example, in the work of Christopher Phillips. The non-instrumental \\"epistemological dialogue\\", a term introduced by Alexander Sidorkin, is a purified dialogue to abstract a single main theme, a development of a main concept, and unfold the logic. According to Sidorkin, ontological dialogic pedagogy priorities human ontology in pedagogical dialogue: Sociolinguist Per Linell and educational philosopher Alexander Sidorkin evidence a non- instrumental ecological approach to dialogic pedagogy that focuses on the dialogicity of the mundane everyday social interaction, its non-constrained nature, in which participants can have freedom to move in and out of the interaction, and the absence or minimum of pedagogical violence. Using the metaphor of \\"free-range kids\\", Lenore Skenazy defines the participants in this ecological dialogue as free-range dialogic participants.

Early life Jessie Mary Trout was born to Archibald Trout on July 26, 1895 at Owen Sound off of Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada. She graduated from Owen Sound Collegiate Institute and studied at the teachers college, Toronto Normal School. She was a school teacher, when she traveled to Indianapolis in 1920. She also studied at The College of Missions in Indianapolis, which trained missionaries in the Campbell Movement. The school was founded by the Christian Woman's Board of Missions. Career =Japan= Inspired by a church member, Trout served as a missionary in Japan for the American Presbyterian Board from 1921 to 1940, spending the first two years learning Japanese. The she served women and girls in Akita. She taught at the Margaret K. Long for Girls (Japanese: Joshi Se Gakun, meaning Girl‚Äôs Holy School) in Tokyo beginning in 1931. She worked from 1935 to 1940 in an ecumenical program in Kagawa, under Toyohiko Kagawa. She entertained notable people and translated his works. She took a leave in 1940 and due to increased nationalism was unable to return to Japan, losing her belongings, including an extensive print collection. While in Japan, she met and mentored Itoko Maeda, a young girl attending the Christian school. Trout aided Maeda in getting scholarships to continue her Christian education, both in Japan and the United States. Itoko Maeda would later go on to become an important missionary in her own right. =Japanese-American internment camps= During World War II, Trout left Japan and returned to the United States. She was one of the church leaders who visited Japanese Internment camps during World War II to conduct \\"mass meetings, seminars, open forums, ministers' conferences, [and] Bible study sessions,\\" serving the Emergency Million Movement as Associate Director. The Disciples of Christ was outspoken in its opposition to the internment of Japanese Americans and as Conner writes, \\"[It] took a leading role in a well-coordinated, national public and private effort to move Japanese Americans out of internment camps and resettle them in towns and cities across the nation‚Äôs heartland.\\" Trout, as a Disciples missionary, aided in this effort by touring rural Indiana communities to determine the availability of employment for, and sentiments towards, the internees. =Leadership= In the 1940s, she was the national security of the magazine of the United Christian Missionary Society, World Call.

Trout helped co-found the Christian Women's Fellowship in 1950 and served as chief executive of the Christian Women's Fellowship. Throughout United States and Canada, there were about 250,000 members in more than 4,200 groups. This was a significant effort to organize efforts of women and make their efforts more meaningful during a conservative period when women's leadership roles within the Christian Church was limited. It merged local women's guilds and missionary organizations. She founded the International Christian Women's Fellowship (1953). Trout also helped establish women's groups in Britain and visited women's groups in Thailand, Germany, Japan, the Philippines, Britain, and Pakistan.

Early life and education The son of a doctor, O'Donnell graduated from Tufts College in 1920 with a B.A. degree. He then did graduate work at Harvard University and Dijon University. Career O'Donnell served as an infantry lieutenant in World War I. In 1923, he became a reporter and assistant city editor at the New York American, a post he held until 1927, when he joined the New York Daily News. After others noticed his knack for political journalism, he was assigned to report on Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1932 presidential inauguration. In 1939, after World War II broke out, he became a correspondent for the Daily News; in this capacity he spent time with the British military's forces on the Maginot line in France. O'Donnell followed his publisher's turn from admiration to intense criticism of President Roosevelt. In 1942, Roosevelt gave an Iron Cross to Earl Godwin, whereupon he asked that it be given to O'Donnell. Roosevelt cited O'Donnell's reporting on former White House correspondent George Durno (viewed by other reporters as the President's favorite) as the reason for this gesture, which was criticized by the Chicago Tribune as a \\"new low in vilification\\". According to an Army history, even with its hasty retraction,Ann Pfau, Miss Yourlovin: GIs, Gender, and Domesticity during World War II (Columbia University Press, 2008), chap. 2, online \\"Forced to retract his allegations, O'Donnell and his publisher remained determined to discredit the corps. Soon after this incident, O'Donnell was discovered 'canvassing Army general hospitals.' He sought [to] ascertain the number of Waacs hospitalized for pregnancy and thus defend his reputation with undeniable proof of promiscuity.\\" Footnote omitted. O'Donnell's June 8, 1943 \\"Capitol Stuff\\" column did \\"incalculable damage\\" to the Women's Army Corps, thwarting recruiting efforts in war time. That column began, \\"Contraceptives and prophylactic equipment will be furnished to members of the WAACS, according to a super secret agreement reached by the high ranking officers of the War Department and the WAAC chieftain, Mrs. William Pettus Hobby‚Ä¶.\\" This followed O'Donnell's June 7 column discussing efforts of women journalists and congresswomen to dispel \\"the gaudy stories of the gay and careless way in which the young ladies in uniform ‚Ä¶ disport themselves‚Ä¶.\\" Although the allegations were refuted, the \\"fat was in the fire. The morals of the WAACs became a topic of general discussion‚Ä¶.\\" Denials of O'Donnell's fabrications and others like them were ineffectual. According to Mattie Treadwell's Army history, as long as three years after O'Donnell's column, \\"religious publications were still to be found reprinting the story, and actually attributing the columnist's lines to Director Hobby. Director Hobby's picture was labeled 'Astounding Degeneracy' ‚Ä¶.\\" Personal life O'Donnell married and divorced three times. His second marriage, in 1930, was to fellow journalist Doris Fleeson; their daughter, Doris, was born two years later. O'Donnell and Fleeson divorced in 1942, after their political views had begun to diverge. During his marriage to Fleeson, he worked with her on a column called \\"Capitol Stuff\\". He died on December 17, 1961 at Georgetown University Hospital.

The team is named after the previous Birmingham-area teams in the World Hockey Association and East Coast Hockey League. History In 1992, Art Clarkson obtained the rights to an East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) franchise for Birmingham and named it after the former World Hockey Association team, the Birmingham Bulls. However, he sold the ECHL team in 1997 and it eventually relocated in 2001. In early 2017, Clarkson began proposing a new Bulls team to begin play due to the increased presence of hockey in the area. Due to arena issues, the team could not play at the Birmingham‚ÄìJefferson Convention Complex like the other former teams, but instead settled on the smaller Pelham Civic Center in nearby Pelham, Alabama, in February 2017. The Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL) announced its approval of the Bulls as an expansion team on April 26, 2017. Longtime ECHL Bulls' player Jamey Hicks was named as the inaugural head coach and director of hockey operations. In their inaugural season, the team finished second-to-last and missed the playoffs. In their second season, the team improved and had the second best regular season record in the league led by the SPHL's most valuable player Josh Harris, goaltender of the year Mavric Parks, and coach of the year Jamey Hicks.

She was the second wife of Alexander Campbell. The daughter of Samuel and Anna Maria (Bean) Bakewell, her birth was registered as having occurred in the Parish of St. Mary at Lichfield in Staffordshire County, England. Her birth record notes that her family were non-conformists, indicating they were not members of the Anglican Church, but were either Presbyterian, Independent, or Baptist. Selina Bakewell was baptized at nineteen years of age by her mentor, Alexander Campbell, and had a close relationship with his wife, Margaret Brown Campbell. She became a member of the Wellsburg, West Virginia, Church of Christ and formed a very close relationship with the Campbell family. So close that, as Margaret lay dying of tuberculosis, Margaret secured a promise from her husband to consider the young miss Baker for the role of stepmother to their five daughters. Campbell was instrumental in the planning of Bethany College with her husband. In 1856, she became the first woman within the Disciples of Christ to call for funds to support foreign missions in her Millennial Harbinger article \\"To My Christian Sisters in Common Faith\\". The article was written in support of Mary Williams, the sole missionary of the Stone-Campbell movement at the time. Campbell's efforts to promote the Gospel outside of preaching served as an example of how women could take on a more active role within the Disciples of Christ. Campbell \\"believed women's preaching was in no way supported by Scripture, but she found plenty of evidence for participation in other ways, such as teaching children, in the New Testament.\\" Selina believed that scriptures in the Bible should be the final authority regarding the subject of female preachers. One of her foundational arguments rested on the fact that Jesus chose all men to be his twelve disciples. Another of her arguments related to Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 14:34, \\"women should remain silent in the church.\\" Selina believed there was a lack of scriptural precedent to support female preachers. In addition, she questioned the motives of the women of her time, stating, \\"Many of my sex are seeking notoriety by coming forward without being called or sent to do the work.\\" It is worth noting that \\"Selina did not use her prominent position as a soapbox. Instead she shared her views with other women, hoping they would find truth in her words.\\" She later served as president of the West Virginia chapter of the Christian Woman's Board of Missions. In 1881, Campbell completed a book about her husband's life, Home Life and Reminiscences of Alexander Campbell, which provides domestic and biographical details of Alexander Campbell.

Personal life and career  Rockline was the daughter of a Russian man and a French woman, and started her career in Moscow, studying in the studio of Ilya Mashkov, who considered her one of his most brilliant students. In 1918 she became an apprentice at Aleksandra Ekster's studio in Kiev, Ukraine. Ekster, who personally knew Pablo Picasso and Guillaume Apollinaire had great influence on Rockline's initial style, also inspiring her creative and free painting spirit. In 1918 and 1919, she exhibited at the 24th Moscow Artists Association Exposition, and in other gallery and association exhibitions. Also in 1918, she married a Mr.Rokhlin, from whom she adopted his name. In 1919 she left Russia, spending two years in Tbilisi and in 1921 she immigrated to France, where she eventually obtained French citizenship. At first, Rockline and her husband lived with relatives of her mother, in Burgundy. In 1922, they moved to Paris, where there were a large Russian community, of which Rockline became part, living at Rue de Hambourg, n¬∫ 12, near Montmartre. = Road to success = In 1922, Rockline exhibited paintings in the Russian section of the Salon d'Automne, at the Salon des Independants and at the Salon Tuileries, where she had a positive reception from media and visitors. Some of her paintings won prizes in the expositions. The journalist and art critic Raymond Escholier (1882-1971), curator of Petit Palais museum, called her series of artistic nude paintings a \\"symphony of flesh\\". After styling herself on Cubism and Impressionism, Rockline started to develop her own style, \\"something between Courbet and Renoir\\", according to the critics from L‚ÄôArt et les Artistes\\" magazine'. Paul Poiret was one of her admirers and bought two of her paintings, helping to promote her art and introduced her to the French poet and art aficionado, Charles Vildrac (1882-1971), who helped Rockline on her first solo exhibition in his gallery in 1924. In 1927, she became member of Salon d‚ÄôAutomne Society, a privileged position and became independent of her husband, probably divorcing him and moved to Montparnasse. Her financial independence coincided with a change in her art style. Her works became lighter, free, closer to Impressionism, with a softer color palette, predominantly with Renoir-styled brushstrokes. Always focused on depicting female nudes, who predominated on her studio, she joined the Women Artists' Society and established close contact with several art colleagues, in particular Zinaida Serebriakova. Rockline had several solo art exhibitions in Paris galleries, including Vildrac (1925), Bernheim (1926), La Boetie (1930) and Barreiro (1932, 1933). At the peak of her fame and success, Rockline committed suicide on 4 April 1934, in Paris. She was buried in Recey-sur-Ource, C√¥te-d‚ÄôOr,in Burgundy.  Legacy  Although Rockline was almost forgotten in the later half of the 20th century, from 2000 on a new interest on her art arose from galleries and art collectors. In 2002 a large exhibition of her work was held in Montparnasse, ‚ÄúElles de Montparnasse\\", where her works were shown together with works by Tamara de Lempicka, Marie Laurencin, Hannah Orlova, Sonia Delaunay and Natalia Goncharova. A retrospective exhibition of Vera Rockline's works was held in Galerie Drouart (Paris, France) in 1984. Since 2017 Galerie Drouart (now Cabinet Expertise Drouart) is preparing the catalogue raisonn√© of Vera Rockline. In June 2008, her painting Card Players (1919) was sold in an auction at Christie's, in London, for 2 million pounds.

The company was the special effects industry leader for decades, until Industrial Light and Magic surpassed them in the late 1980s. In 1990, CRC began to concentrate its efforts on titles and opticals, and became the industry leader in those categories, by providing the titles and opticals for over 400 productions in the decade before the CEO's passing in 2000. Business card for CEO of Cinema Research Corporation from 1971 with old area code for Hollywood, California with defunct phone number. History Cinema Research Corporation was founded in 1953 by Charles Pati from Brooklyn, New York. He moved to California at the age of 40 with the dream of getting involved with the film industry in Hollywood. By 1954, he had his first title, The Black Pirates, for which he created the special effects. By the end of that decade, he owned the largest special effects studio in Hollywood. His company, Cinema Research Corporation did titles, opticals, trailers, and special effects. The Compound was located at 6860 Lexington Avenue, in Hollywood, California. It took up a square block. CRC was an early pioneer in the special effects community, and evolved into all areas of film related to pre- and post-production, until Charlie Pati's death in 2000 at 86 years old. During its heyday, his company was involved in over 670 full-length Hollywood movies. Charles Pati's passing ended Cinema Research Corporation, however others have used a DBA (Doing Business As) CRC, but none succeeded, and all are now defunct.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. In this species, the non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single small, shiny green and white flower with leaves on the flowering spike. Description Pterostylis alveata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of dark green leaves, each leaf 10‚Äì25 mm long and 5‚Äì15 mm wide. Flowering plants have a single flower 12‚Äì15 mm long and 7‚Äì10 mm wide borne on a spike 100‚Äì200 mm high with between three and five spreading stem leaves. The flowers are shiny green and white. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward with a pointed tip. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have a thread-like tip 12‚Äì15 mm long and a flat, protruding sinus between their bases. The labellum is 8‚Äì9 mm long, 3 mm wide, dark brown and blunt, just visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from May to June.  Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis alveata was first formally described in 1939 by John (\\"Ros\\") Garnet from a specimen collected on Snake Island. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (alveata) is a Latin word meaning \\"hollowed out\\". Distribution and habitat The coastal greenhood grows among grasses in moist coastal woodland and scrub between Melbourne in Victoria and Nelson Bay in New South Wales.

Frank received the 2008 Award for Research in Mood Disorders from the American College of Psychiatrists, and the 2011 Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize in Mental Health from the National Academy of Medicine for her research on mood disorders and their treatment. She also received the 2015 James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award from the Association for Psychological Science.  Biography  Ellen Frank graduated from Vassar College in 1966 with a bachelor's degree in Drama. She pursued her master's degree in English at Carnegie Mellon University. Frank worked as a research assistant with David Kupfer and Thomas Detre at the University of Pittsburgh, who inspired her to investigate the science of treatment in psychiatry. Frank completed her PhD in Clinical Psychology in 1979 at the University of Pittsburgh. Frank is the director of the Depression and Manic Depression Prevention program at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh. She received a MERIT award from the National Institute of Mental Health which supported her work in developing Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy. Frank was named an honorary fellow of the American Psychiatric Association in 1991 and served as a member of the Mood Disorders Workgroup of the American Psychiatric Association DSM-V Task Force. She served as Chair of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Panel and as a member of the U.S. National Advisory Mental Health Council. She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 1999.  Research  Ellen Frank is an expert on mood disorders and their treatment. She and her colleagues developed Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), a hybrid of Interpersonal Psychotherapy and Social Rhythm Therapy, which aims \\"to help people improve their moods by understanding and working with their biological and social rhythms.\\" IPSRT assumes that disruptions in circadian and social rhythms, including eating and sleeping schedules, place vulnerable individuals at an elevated risk for onsets of episodes of depression or mania. Therapists using IPSRT aim to teach their clients how to stabilize their social routines to create order in their lives. Frank's book titled Treating Bipolar Disorder: A Clinician's Guide to Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy provides a manual for beginning therapists interested in adopting this treatment approach. In collaboration Jessica Levenson, Frank co-authored the book Interpersonal Psychotherapy (Theories of Psychotherapy), which endorses interpersonal therapy as an effective and easy-to-implement treatment for depression and other mental health conditions. Some of Frank's most cited research has focused on individuals who suffer from recurrent depression; these studies examined the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy as maintenance treatment alone or in combination with medication in preventing relapse.

Those who spoke out about the abuses of their side in the conflict were seen as traitors to their community, and therefore, only a few became witnesses in war crime trials. The international institutions ICTY, UNMIK and EULEX, and national courts in Serbia and Kosovo, have all had problems in ensuring safety for testifying protected witnesses. According to observers, one of the main reasons that the Kosovo Relocated Specialist Judicial Institution will partly operate outside Kosovo is the past failures of the international institutions to protect witnesses. According to Carla Del Ponte, the former ICTY prosecutor, \\"the investigation of the Kosovo Liberation Army fighters appeared to be the most frustrating of all the investigations done by the ICTY\\", and stated \\"witnesses were so afraid and intimidated that they even feared to talk about the KLA presence in some areas, not to mention actual crimes\\". She further stated that \\"I am convinced that UNMIK and even KFOR officers were afraid for their lives and the lives of their missions‚Äô members. I think some of the ICTY judges were afraid that they would become a target for the Albanians\\" and believes that witness intimidation seriously affected the acquitting verdicts against KLA officials Fatmir Limaj and Ramush Haradinaj. Numerous witnesses did change their testimonies during trials, while others were killed or mysteriously disappeared. Avni Zogiani, leader of an anti-corruption nongovernmental organization in Kosovo, said \\"Intimidation and even killings of witnesses are nothing new or shocking in Kosovo\\". EULEX prosecutor Charles Hardaway said that \\"Witness intimidation, not only in war crimes but in other cases too, is happening from people with high competencies in government who are powerful\\". According to Belgian author Jelle Janssens, it was reported that judges and prosecutors became terrified at the mention of high-ranking KLA officers or politicians in case files. Del Ponte asserts that there were serious abuses of witnesses in Kosovo local criminal proceedings, and also alleged that UNMIK leaked sensitive information about witnesses to defendants, which UNMIK denied but later admitted that it had stopped some investigations into high-level perpetrators due to political reasons. The Humanitarian Law Center concluded that a large number of acquittals were due to witnesses changing their stories, suspecting intimidation. A bomb was placed under the car of a witness in 2002, and in 2003, witness Tahir Zemaj was murdered in Peƒá after testifying against a senior KLA official, while Sadik Musaj and Ilir Selamaj, witnesses at the same trial, were also killed. Kujtin Berisha was run over in Montenegro, Bekim Mustafa and Auni Elezaj were shot dead. Kosovo policemen Sabaheta Tava and Isuk Hakljaja were found dead in a burnt car. Agim Zogaj, a former KLA commander turned witness, was found dead in 2011. He was a key witness in the case against Fatmir Limaj. A potential witness to the Kleƒçka killings feared for his safety and decided not to testify, following news of Zogaj's death. In 2016, former KLA local commander Bedri Curri was shot dead, and in 2017 his daughter was killed in a car crash, the two deaths linked in Kosovo media to Curri's planning to testify against KLA crimes.

It is located on the highest point of the hill of Epipolae (about 120 metres above sea level), around 7 km northwest of Syracuse.  History  The third moat. In the background, the remains of the drawbridge are visible. During the Athenian invasion of Sicily (415-413 BC), the fortress did not yet exist, but the strategic importance of the area was clear; the Athenians initially captured the hill, but their failure to retain it prevented them from effectively besieging the city. The name Euryalus is mentioned by Thucydides in the course of the first Athenian attack on the city.Thucydides 6.97 Later in his account, after the reconquest of Epipolae from the Athenians by the Syracusans, a Syracusan garrison on the site is mentioned.Thucydides 7.43 In light of this experience, the fortress was first established by Dionysius I, tyrant of Syracuse. Construction took place between 402 and 397 BC, with the intention that the fortress would protect the city from siege and attack by the Carthaginians. Various renovations were subsequently undertaken in response to developments in siege weaponry, under Agathocles and Hiero II. After the Roman conquest of the city in 212 BC by Marcus Claudius Marcellus, the fortress continued to be modified until the Byzantine period when parts of it were torn apart in order to repair the rest in light of Muslim invasion. In 1939, King Victor Emmanuel III visited the monument in an official capacity. In 1941, during the Second World War, the artefacts in the Syracuse archaeological museum were carried by mule to the fortress and hidden in its tunnels, so that they would be safe from aerial bombardment. On 30 September 2016, an antiquarium was opened on the site, after a long closure resulting from the Santa Lucia earthquake of 1990. This building contains some of the discoveries from the site, including a sword, a helmet, and the missiles from a stone-throwing catapult.  Description  = Moats = The entrance to the fortress is protected by three ditches and one lateral ditch. The first and smallest ditch is 6 metres long and 4 metres deep (see A on the map below). The second is 86 metres away from the first and is around 50 metres long (B). It defends a forward bastion, behind which is a third ditch which is 17 metres long and 9 metres deep (D) which links the defensive system with the tunnels. In the south part of this ditch, there is a draw bridge which allows one to cross the ditch from one set of fortifications to the other (C and E). There was also an internal staircase which allowed access to C from ditch D. Finally, on the south side, there was a fourth ditch (H), which protected the shallowest part of the lateral slope of Epipolae. Tunnels link this ditch with ditch D. = Fortifications = Between the ditches is the central fortress which has a rectangular shape (G, erroneously listed as \\"C\\" on the map). Beyond ditch D, the central fortress which was open in the Greek period, is closed by five square towers (), which were probably about 15 metres high with crenellations on top as well as 4th century BC rainwater spouts in the shape of lions' heads, now kept in the Museo Paulo Orsi. The towers were probably platforms for catapults. Near the central fortress there are three large cisterns which could provide water in the event of a siege. Plan of the fortress Beyond the central fortress, there is a large wall, where the entrance to the castle was (called the Tryolon because it is made up of three gates) at the east end, which is about 5 metres thick which links the whole complex to the Dionysian walls. It was defended by further towers and a double vaulted entranceway. The west end was linked to the fortress at a high point of the plateau, near a cistern and a watchtower. = Strategic elements = water spout in the shape of a lion's head, from the central fortress The whole construction consists of different strategic elements which serve to surprise attackers. The complex system of galleries allowed troops to move from one part of the fortress to another without being seen from outside. The ditches on the north side of the castle are visible only when one is very close to them, so that in an attack, there would have been a real danger of falling in and being killed by sentries, especially during rapid assaults. Additionally, there are many places in which it is possible to conceal defending troops in ambush - like the large number of galleries The was built in a way that limits frontal attacks on the city and such that the Dionysian walls limited line-of-sight to the right of the gate, as well as attacks with battering rams. The side towers and the fortifications also limit the effectiveness of an attack. The gate is linked to a gallery which allows movement between ditch D and H.

The settlement was located next to Mill Creek, a tributary to the Kansas River. Vera was noted for its fertile agricultural land. History Frederick L. Raymond was an early settler. When the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a line through the area in 1887, part of it ran through Raymond's farm. Raymond was influential in getting a flag station and post office named \\"Vera\\" erected at the location. The residents of Vera paid for a siding to be built, and donated of land on which the flag station, as well as a platform and stock yard, were built. The railway was soon after acquired by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. In 1893, residents of Vera filed a complaint with the Kansas Board of Railroad Commissioners, claiming the settlement needed a depot and additional storage facilities. They argued that because Vera was separated from its two neighboring rail stations at Paxico and Maple Hill by ranges of hills, it was difficult to haul grain and farm products to these places. The Railroad Commissioners ordered the railroad to erect a depot at Vera which could shelter passengers and protect local freight. Vera was noted as having a store, operated by John Verity. References were made in 1913 and 1939 to a school existing in Vera. In early 1920s, a steel bridge was built along Vera Road where it crossed Mill Creek north of the settlement.

He served as the archbishop of Besan√ßon from 1355 until his transfer to the diocese of Metz in 1361. He was transferred to the prince-bishopric of Basel in 1365. In all three dioceses, he was unable to live peacefully with the townspeople, finally resulting in open warfare in Basel. In each of his bishoprics he was the third bishop of his name, Jean III.\\"Vienne, Jean de\\", Saarl√§ndische Biografien.Romain Jurot, \\"Vienne, Jean de [Johann von]\\", in Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse ‚Äì Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz ‚Äì Dizionario storico della Svizzera (2013). Jean's father was Gauthier or Vauthier (died 1344), the lord of Mirebel. His mother was the heiress of the lordship of Achillande de La Roche-en-Montagne. In 1337, Jean was a canon and choirmaster of the diocese of Chalon. In 1339, he was the treasurer of the cathedral of Saint-Jean in Besan√ßon. Shortly after, he became the dean of Besan√ßon's church of Sainte-Madeleine. On 8 June 1355, Jean was appointed to succeed his relative, either an uncle or a second cousin, Hugues de Vienne, as archbishop of Besan√ßon. His archiepiscopate was not a success. In 1356, he served as a councilor to Philip, count of Burgundy. He then got involved in a conflict with the citizens of Besan√ßon, a free imperial city. As a result, he was transferred to the see of Metz on 15 November 1361 by Pope Innocent VI. In Metz, another free imperial city, Jean encountered the same problem keeping peace with the citizens of the town. He moved the episcopal residence to Vic- sur-Seille, but on 13 August 1365 he was transferred to the diocese of Basel. There he encountered for the third time the same difficulty in getting along with the citizens of a free imperial city, owing to his vigorous assertion of the church's temporal rights. He also fell out with his own cathedral chapter. He went to war over Nidau with the noble families of Kyburg and Thierstein. When the episcopal town of Bienne made an alliance with Berne, it was burned to the ground by Jean. The Bernese responded by burning the episcopal property in the city. The bishop was finally defeated in battle at Malleray in 1367. The diocese of Basel was heavily in debt when Jean took it over. After years of war, he was forced to pledge his minting rights and his control of customs and tolls in order to raise money. He resided primarily at Del√©mont. At the start of the Western Schism in 1378, Jean supported the Antipope Clement VII of Avignon, for which he was excommunicated by Pope Urban VI of Rome. Jean died at Porrentruy and was buried there in the parish church of Saint-Pierre.

A plaque signed with Trump's name states that the monument marks what the site's owner purports is an American Civil War battle site having significant casualties, although no listed battle nor publicly disclosed event with any recorded casualties took place at the site.  Monument  The site is on one of two golf courses belonging to the Trump National Golf Club on Lowes Island. Donald Trump acquired the club (formerly known as the Lowes Island Club) in 2009 for $13 million. On the course, between the 14th hole and the 15th tee, Trump had a stone pedestal built with a flagpole on it, and had a plaque placed on the pedestal with the inscription: > Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this > spot, \\"The Rapids\\", on the Potomac River. The casualties were so great that > the water would turn red and thus became known as \\"The River of Blood\\". The plaque bears Trump's name and the Trump Organization's crest. The accompanying text reads, \\"It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River!\\"  Historical accuracy  No such event ever took place at this site. One local historian, Craig Swain, cited the killing of two soldiers by citizens in 1861 as the only Civil War event that occurred on the island. Two years later, on June 27‚Äì28, 1863, General J.E.B. Stuart led 4,500 Confederate soldiers north across the Potomac at Rowser's Ford from the Lowes Island area, on the ride to Gettysburg, but no fatalities were recorded. According to the president of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, the only Civil War battle in the area was the Battle of Ball's Bluff, 11 miles upriver. Other historians consulted by The New York Times for a story in 2015 agreed; one of them had written to the Trump Organization about the falsehood. Trump himself disputed the historians' statements: > That was a prime site for river crossings. So, if people are crossing the > river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were > shot ‚Äî a lot of them. \\"How would they know that?\\" Mr. Trump asked when told > that local historians had called his plaque a fiction. \\"Were they there?\\" Trump said that \\"numerous historians\\" had told him the story of the River of Blood, though he later changed that to say the historians had spoken to \\"my people\\". Finally he said, \\"Write your story the way you want to write it. You don't have to talk to anybody. It doesn't make any difference. But many people were shot. It makes sense.\\" The story broke while Donald Trump's presidential campaign was in full swing, and journalist Rob Crilly noted that at that time he \\"has had more weighty facts to clarify, such as his claim that Muslims in New Jersey cheered on the day of the 9/11 attacks ‚Äì an old rumour that has long been discredited ‚Äì and his latest boast, that he watched people jumping to their deaths from the Twin Towers from his Manhattan flat, four miles away\\". According to Jack Holmes of Esquire magazine, the ahistorical marker is symptomatic of the Trump administration; Jack Holmes points at other historical blunders made by members of the Trump administration, including Kellyanne Conway's reference to the non-existent Bowling Green massacre and Sean Spicer's claim that even Hitler had not used chemical weapons in conventional warfare, although Zyklon-B was used to exterminate prisoners in the Holocaust. Other commentators looked at Trump's golf-course plaque in the context of his many-time expressed admiration for President Andrew Jackson‚Äîespecially evident in May 2017, when President Trump appeared to suggest that he believed that Jackson lamented the Civil War (and could have stopped it) despite Jackson having died sixteen years before its outbreak.

The Exile and the Rock Limpet War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet is an oil painting of 1842 by the English Romantic painter J. M. W. Turner (1775‚Äì1851). Intended to be a companion piece to Turner's Peace ‚Äì Burial at Sea, War is a painting that depicts a moment from Napoleon Bonaparte's exile at Saint Helena. In December 1815, the former Emperor was taken by the British government to the Longwood House, despite its state of disrepair, to live in captivity; during his final years of isolation, Napoleon had fallen into despair. Turner's decision to pair the painting with Peace was heavily criticized when it was first exhibited but it is also seen as predecessor to his more famous piece Rain, Steam and Speed ‚Äì The Great Western Railway (1844).  Background  At the conclusion of his Hundred Days, Napoleon Bonaparte, who suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, had fallen under the custody of the British after considering a bid for an escape to the United States. In December, the former Emperor was exiled to Saint Helena in the South Atlantic and housed under guard in the Longwood House, his situation worsened by the building's poor living conditions. Without any realistic hopes of escape from Saint Helena, Napoleon lived out his final days on the island until his death in 1821. J. M. W. Turner was often inspired by conflicts from the Napoleonic era: his works The Battle of Trafalgar (1807) and The Fighting Temeraire are realizations of the artist's influences. Political overtones also are found in some of Turner's most famous pieces, including Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps (1832). In 1840, Napoleon's ashes were returned to France for a state burial on request by Louis Philippe I, inspiring Turner to make the former Emperor the subject of War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet. War depicts a moment during Napoleon's exile on St. Helena. While on guard of a British sentry, a prevalent reminder of his captivity, Napoleon bows slightly to study a lone rock limpet. In his portrayal of him, Turner sought to embody the futility of war. The sunset behind the figure -- Turner's \\"sea of blood\\" as he described it -- symbolizes the past hardships of war experienced during Napoleon's military campaigns. War debuted at the Royal Academy of Arts besides Turner's other artwork Peace. Burial at Sea in 1842. Peace commemorates Turner's friend Scottish artist Sir David Wilkie who, while on a return voyage from the Far East, died of an illness in 1841. Like its companion piece, War was painted on a smaller canvas and was exhibited in an octagonal frame design. Together, War and Peace contrast the heroic figure that was Napoleon with Wilkie's lonely burial at sea. However, War fared poorly with critics who questioned Turner's decision to pair it with Peace, widely considered the better of the two pieces. Turner's abstract approach to War is noted as an early stepping stone toward his more well-received painting Rain, Steam and Speed ‚Äì The Great Western Railway (1844).

Modeled on Venezuela's El Sistema, a program which brings classical music education to children from low-income communities, YOLA provides free instruments, music training, and academic support to nearly 800 students age 6-18. A \\"social project first and artistic project second,\\" 100% of YOLA's 2016 graduating class completed high school, and 90% went on to college. History Inspired by the Los Angeles Philharmonic's music and artistic director Gustavo Dudamel's experience with Venezuela's El Sistema youth orchestra movement, the LA Phil founded YOLA in 2007. The program was first established at EXPO Center in the mainly Latino and African American community of South Central Los Angeles. Created in partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks and the Harmony Project, it included 80 students. Dudamel began working with YOLA at EXPO in 2008, and in 2009 he inaugurated his tenure at the LA Phil wearing a \\"Youth Orchestra Los Angeles\\" t-shirt. The first official downbeat of Dudamel's Los Angeles career was a performance of \\"Ode to Joy\\" with YOLA at the Hollywood Bowl. Juan Felipe Molano became the conductor of YOLA in 2014 after an international search and audition by the LA Phil. The music and artistic Director of the Yucatan Symphony Orchestra for five years, he had previously conducted the Colombian Youth Philharmonic and was the national director of orchestras for Batuta Colombian System of Youth Orchestras (El Sistema ‚Äì Colombia). From 2009 until 2014, YOLA was conducted by Bruce Anthony Kiesling. YOLA at 10 As of its tenth anniversary in 2017, nearly 800 students participated in YOLA annually. In addition to YOLA at EXPO Center, it includes YOLA at HOLA in LA's Rampart District, a partnership between the LA Phil and the Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA) and YOLA at LACHSA, a partnership with the LA Phil and the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Annually,YOLA provides more than 600 hours of music instruction and more than 120 residency hours with members of the LA Phil as well as programming which includes leadership camps, college prep, and skills training for the program's most advanced students. YOLA has performed with conductors including Simon Rattle, David Robertson, Marin Alsop, Mirga Gra≈æinytƒó-Tyla and Thomas Wilkins and worked with Journey, Stevie Wonder, Juanes, Gloria Estefan, Gwen Stefani, and Hilary Hahn. In addition to the Hollywood Bowl, YOLA performances have taken place at Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Barbican in London, Suntory Hall in Tokyo, and Kresge Auditorium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2016, alongside Beyonc√© and Bruno Mars, 50 YOLA students played the halftime show at the Super Bowl with Coldplay for an audience of 111.9 million viewers. It performed at the 2016 Ojai Music Festival, curated by Peter Sellars, and presented the world premiere of a commissioned work by composer Tania Le√≥n with guest artists the International Contemporary Ensemble. That same year, 80 of YOLA's most advanced students toured for the first time, performing in Los Angeles, Visalia, Fresno, and Oakland, where they were conducted by Dudamel. The Judith and Thomas L. Beckmen YOLA Center at Inglewood In August 2018 YOLA announced the construction of its first dedicated facility, the Judith and Thomas L. Beckmen YOLA Center at Inglewood. The 260-seat concert hall will be housed in a former bank branch which has been redesigned by Frank Gehry, who also designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall. That venue's acoustician, Yasuhisa Toyota, will also work on the YOLA Center. In addition to the main hall, the new center will include a choir room, an ensemble room and a practice studio, with all spaces totaling about 25,000 square feet.

Ramaiah Dass is an Indian poet and script writer who wrote mainly in the Tamil language. He has written more than 500 lyrics for Tamil films. Early life Born to Narayanasamy and Pappu at Manampoochavadi in Thanjavur district, he had his primary and secondary education at St. Peters Higher Secondary school in Thanjavur. Then he graduated as a Pulavar from Karanthai Thamizh Sangam. He was trained as a teacher. Career He started his career as a teacher in a primary school in Thanjavur. While he was working as a teacher, he became interested in stage plays. Soon he joined a drama troupe Sudharsana Ghana Sabha founded by Jagannatha Naidu, as a writer. Then he created his own drama troupe Jayalakshmi Ghana Sabha and produced plays like Macharegai, Dhuruvan, Kambhar, Vidhiyin Pokku, Valli Thirumanam, Alli Arjuna, Pavalakodi and Pahadai Pannirendu. He staged these plays in several towns in Tamil Nadu. Actor and Film Producer T. R. Mahalingam once watched one of his plays and produced it as a film with the same title Macha Regai in 1950. Though the film failed in box office, it opened the way to Ramaiah Dass to settle in Chennai and work in Tamil films. Vijaya Productions was one of the leading film makers who made Tamil and Telugu films. Ramaiah Dass became a permanent writer in this film company from 1950 till 1960. He wrote screenplay, dialogues and lyrics to almost all the Tamil films produced by this company during this period. His songs in films like Pathala Bhairavi, Missiamma, Mayabazar became hits. He was famous for coining words to suit the tune but without any meaning. They were called Jigina words and he was nicknamed as Dappanguthu Paadalaasiriyar (means one who writes lyrics to the beats on a tin box). However, those songs became hits. A case in point is the song \\"Jaalilo Jimkhaanaa, Dolilo Kumkaanaa\\" from the film Amara Deepam. None of the words had any meaning but the song was a hit. In all he wrote 532 lyrics in 83 films, wrote screenplay and dialogues for 25 films and wrote story for 10 films between 1950 and 1963. Producer He produced a film titled \\"Lalithangi\\" with M. G. Ramachandran in the lead role. As per the story the main character is a religiously devoted young man. He created a scene with a song praising God. But M. G. R. who was a front-line member in Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam that had atheist policy, refused to act in the scene. 10 thousand feet of the film had already been shot. Anyway, Ramaiah Dass stopped the production and produced the same story with the title Rani Lalithangi with Sivaji Ganesan in the lead role. MGR challenged him in judicial courts but Ramaiah Dass was unperturbed. He won the case. However, MGR continued to be in good terms with him. His daughter said by producing films he lost what he earned as a writer. Writer He wrote a book titled Thirukural Isai Amudham in 1962. The book was released by M. G. Ramachandran who was the President of the South Indian Artistes Society at that time. The Government of Tamil Nadu paid ‚Çπ600,000 to his family and made his works as public property. Guru In 1952, a young man, Jesudoss was introduced to Ramaiah Dass. He made the young man as his assistant and christened him as Aroordas. (Jesudoss was from Thiruvarur.) Aroordas later turned out to be a most popular writer in Tamil films. Family Ramaiah Dass had two wives - Thaayaarammal and Ranganayagi. He had a daughter, Vijayarani and a son, Ravindran from each wife. Ravindran is an Editor in Prasad Lab while Vijayarani is a housewife. Death Ramaiah Dass died on 16 January 1965.

After the 2015 purchase, a Hawthorne executive told the press, \\"the lion's share of General Hydroponics business in North America is cannabis growers\\". Scotts' CEO decided to spin off a cannabis business after a 2013 visit to a garden store in Yakima, Washington with a large section of hydroponic equipment. According to Forbes, Scotts had invested more than $250 million in the subsidiary by mid 2016. In March 2018, the Hawthorne Gardening Company and The Flowr Corporation (a Canadian Licensed Producer of medical cannabis) announced an R&D; partnership, building North America's first dedicated facility for cannabis research and development.

Driscoll is introduced as a false protagonist, only to be exposed as a member of Mona's army and a close friend of Jenna Marshall. Sydney returns in the series' seventh season, later revealed to be a helper of \\"A.D.\\" and a member of the A-Team.  Casting  On April 3, 2014, it was announced that Chloe Bridges was cast as Sydney Driscoll. Showrunner I. Marlene King stated that she had wanted Bridges for the role of Sydney for a few seasons, but waited until she would be able to cast her.  Development  = Characterization and introduction = The character is introduced in the fifth-season episode \\"Surfing the Aftershocks\\", as a new swimmer at Rosewood High. She befriends Emily, who begins helping her with her swimming. Driscoll initially appears to be a sweet and soft-spoken student with an identity crisis, although she's later revealed to be working against the Liars.  Story lines  = Season 5 = Emily first notices Sydney in \\"Surfing the Aftershocks\\", staring at her by the staircase at Rosewood High and later again at the lockers. Thinking that she is staring because of Alison, Emily confronts her, only for Sydney to disclose that she admires her swimming talent and would love to hear Emily's opinions on her own abilities. At first, Emily is hesitant, but agrees to help Driscoll. Having watched Sydney swim, Emily and Driscoll head into the locker rooms, where Emily begins to measure Sydney's height to arm span ratio. Paige walks in and starts helping Emily, leading to an awkward conversation filled with suggestive innuendos. Walking into the locker rooms in \\"Thrown From the Ride\\", Sydney is disappointed in her 58-second time. Emily informs Driscoll that her technique has gotten better and then asks if they want to meet up the next day. Sydney replies that she'll have to ask her parents first, but it should be okay. Emily explains that her mother keeps asking questions about Alison's return to Rosewood, and Sydney tells her it's only natural and that she has questions too. The following day, Sydney meets Emily in the locker room and apologises for being late. Emily asks if Paige wants to join them, and Sydney backs her up, saying they're only doing sprints on the track. At the Pizzeria in town, Driscoll is spotted with Emily and Paige grabbing some food. As Alison walks into school during \\"Miss Me x 100\\", Paige tells Sydney she can't stay and leaves. In the locker room, Sydney discloses to Emily that the school's Glee club is sponsoring a Frozen sing along event, but Emily displays very little interest. Sydney reminds her that there will be free pizza and that Emily will avoid \\"playing 20 questions with her mother\\" in regards to Ali's return. Emily agrees to go. In the Rosewood High courtyard, Sydney and Emily are buying popcorn, when Paige divulges that Jenna is back in town and Shana is deceased. She explains to Sydney that Marshall is a blind girl who used to attend Rosewood High, and that her and Shana were in a romantic relationship. Emily is uncomfortable and explains to Sydney that Jenna and Alison hate each other and that she alongside the other Liars were drafter into their feud. When the Liars walk into the cafeteria at school, Mona and her army - including Sydney - confront the girls, with Mona coming forward and exposing Alison's lie with a video that proves Ali slapped her at the town's church. Near the end of the episode, Driscoll and Marshall step out of Jenna's car, pulling up a picnic ground. Sydney comments on the mustang parked in front of them, and Jenna discloses to Driscoll that it used to be hers. Walking over to Mona, Sydney informs her that the Liars do not want things to go back to the way they were. Jenna further divulges that they remember the way Alison treated them. Mona is happy to hear this and muses that maybe they can get rid of Alison. The three girls turn to look as a third car pulls up. During \\"The Silence of E. Lamb\\", Sydney walks out of a stall in the girls' bathroom as Alison and Emily are talking. She introduces herself to Alison and compliments her scarf. Sydney later discloses to Emily that someone left a rat in Paige's locker after practice. When Emily asks who did it, Sydney tells her no one has fessed up, and the coach wants a team meeting, but Sydney doesn't think it was someone on the Sharks as everyone loves Paige. Emily comments that she hasn't seen Paige yet, and Sydney deduces she skipped school. As Emily walks up to Mona and asks what she knows about Paige's incident, Mona greets Sydney, and Sydney greets her back. At the Brew, Driscoll is standing behind Hanna in the line where she introduces herself and mentions that she's having a hot date with her homework. After asking if Hanna's on her way out, Hanna replies she just had dinner at Emily's. Sydney senses a whiff of alcohol coming from Hanna's breath and asks if she would like to sit for a minute. When Hanna tells her she's just going to head home, Sydney suggests Hanna to wait for her so they can split a Panini. During their meal, Sydney lifts a newspaper that has the Cavanaugh house explosion on the front, and mentions to Hanna that she was just reading about what happened. Hanna says that they were at Emily's house when it happened, and when Driscoll asks if she knew who lived in the house, Hanna tells her that their friend Toby grew up there with his stepsister Jenna. Sydney states that Jenna's name keeps popping up, and that people seem to have a lot of beef with her and asks Hanna if she's ever wanted to make peace with Hanna. Hanna informs her that there was always the possibility that they could have done so and almost slips about the events that took place in New York with Shana. Having grabbed some more coffee, Sydney suggests dropping off Hanna off at home, but Hanna tells her she'll walk home instead. After asking if she's sure, Driscoll picks up her books and tells Hanna that she'll see her at school before walking out. In \\"Scream For Me\\", Sydney is changing in the Rosewood High locker rooms when Emily approaches her. Emily couldn't watch practice because she got hung up in the language lab before thanking Sydney for helping Hanna sober up the night before. She questions Sydney about what Hanna might've said and whether she mentioned New York. Sydney says she didn't and wonders why Emily really came into the locker rooms. Sydney discloses to Emily the team wants her to be the assistant coach, but Emily says she already has a lot going on. Walking into Emily's bedroom, Sydney hands Emily the hooded sweatshirt and says she got ahead of herself. She explains that since they've stopped training together, Driscoll just wanted to have someone in the bleachers cheering for her, since her boyfriend is off in college and her parents aren't into it. Sydney lets it slip that she knows Emily and her friends were in New York, but covers when Emily points out her lie by saying she must've been mixed up from too much time in the pool. Walking out of a consulting room during \\"March of Crimes\\", Jenna and Sydney stop when Emily calls out Sydney. As Emily asks Driscoll what she's doing at the Optometrists office, Marshall explains that Sydney was her ride, before asking if it posed a problem. Emily wonders when Jenna and Sydney became friends, and when Marshall attempts to get Sydney to walk away with her, Spencer instructs Sydney to answer Emily's questions. Stepping in, Jenna says that it sounded more like an accusation, and when Emily asks Driscoll why she never mentioned being friends with Jenna. This leads to a heated argument, and Marshall eventually leaves accompanied by Sydney. Later on the episode, Driscoll reveals to Emily that she met Jenna when she volunteered at a school for the visually impaired and have remained friends ever since the day Alison visited Marshall to threaten her. Driscoll returned to Rosewood per Marshall's request, fearing that Alison would bully her once more. In order to get back at Sydney for her betrayal, Emily decides to accept the coaching position in order to keep an eye on her as much. Emily then proceeds to drive away and leave Driscoll stood up in the middle of the street. Throughout \\"How the 'A' Stole Christmas\\", Jenna is part of the school choir who are singing Christmas songs for the Shady Days Nursing Home, alongside Paige, Emily, Lucas and Sydney. Unbeknownst at the time, Jenna is one of Alison's followers at the Masquerade Ice Ball. Still wearing a mask, Jenna and another one of Alison's followers, later revealed as Driscoll, pose for a photo with Lucas, who is dressed as Santa Claus. Lucas tells the two masked beauties to come in closer, and after the photo is taken, he wishes them a Merry Christmas. After gaining Emily's attention, Marshall and Sydney begin walking through the crowd, with Driscoll looking over her shoulder to make sure Emily would follow her trace. As Emily enters the room which has been draped off with fabric, Jenna sits on the couch, while Sydney reveals herself to Emily and explains that she led Emily to an isolated location because she didn't want Alison to witness them talking. As Driscoll walks towards Jenna, Emily tells Sydney that she really gets around, and questions if Jenna knows Sydney is with Alison now. Jenna then takes off her mask and reveals to Emily they suspect Alison of being accountable for Mona's murder. = Season 7 = In \\"The DArkest Knight\\", Mona and Caleb manage to bug Jenna's cellphone and eavesdrop a voice message she left for Noel after he failed to return any of her calls. Afterwards, Hanna contacts Mona to help her return to Rosewood with a convincing narrative after having abducted Noel. Once Hanna successfully fabricates a story to the police on how she went to Hollybrook to track down the girl Kahn pushed down a flight of stairs at a frat party, Mona purposely bumps into Marshall at The Radley. Jenna is given an ultimatum to conspire with the Liars, after Mona implies that Marshall's partnership with Noel would send both of them to prison. Jenna initially subdues to Mona's coercion, seeing as her and Caleb later await for Marshall by the Radley's bar. Nonetheless, Jenna manages to trick the duo after hiring Sydney to pose as a decoy and serve them coffee in order to buy Marshall sufficient time to track down the Liars at gunpoint at an abandoned school for blind students. Throughout \\"Hold Your Piece\\", Aria and Emily team up to track down Sydney's whereabouts in hopes of finding Jenna. After searching her name online, they discover that Driscoll graduated from Berkeley College, with a double major in Economics and French. Sydney currently resides in a loft at Fishtown, Philadelphia, whilst working as a bank teller at a private department that services extremely wealthy clients. The girls also learn that Sydney checked into a charity gala for the Manhattan Children's Hospital, the same ball where Katherine made an appearance wearing Hanna's dress. Following this enlightenment, Emily googles the event and comes across a picture of Daly posing on a red carpet whilst Driscoll sneakily uses a phone to photograph her dress. The girls deduce that Sydney's loyalty to Marshall places her as the strongest contender serving as Spencer's shooter. They conclude Driscoll most likely made adjustments for Marshall to be clothed in a duplicate of Hanna's dress so Jenna could omit the truth from the authorities. Aria promptly suggests for her and Emily to head over to Sydney's address to gather more insight into the situation. Following a quick lesson from Caleb on spying techniques, Aria instructed Emily to approach Driscoll and clone her phone. During a conversation with Emily at an outdoor diner, Sydney explains that she tried to distance herself from Marshall over the years. Driscoll further adds that she did the coffee delivery unbeknownst that Noel and Jenna were intending to kill the girls. Their interaction is cut short once Sydney informs Emily that she has conference calls all afternoon. However, this information is quickly proven to be false. Through access to Driscoll's phone, the girls discover that Sydney had an appointment at the Vogel Vision Institute and eavesdrop the meeting. Turns out Driscoll was paying for an operation to give Jenna her sight back and she uttered the initials \\"A.D.\\" as the donor for the cost. After Sydney exits the clinic, Aria and Emily aggressively confront her. Driscoll still claimed to not knowing where Marshall was, so Aria slipped a tracker in her bag to maintain her under their radar. In \\"Power Play\\", Emily reveals that Driscoll played them and left the device on a greyhound to Philadelphia. Aria receives a FaceTime call from a blocked number on her iPad. Once she answers, we see \\"A.D.\\" in a black hoodie on the other end. The mysterious entity divulges to Aria they own a stolen file from Jessica DiLaurentis' burnt lair at Carol Ward's storm cellar containing information that could send Ezra to jail. Aria immediately disconnects the call, marches over to the board game, and hurls her player piece across the room. Later in the episode, Aria and Alison are following the game's directions for Ali's turn. Abruptly, the game phone starts making a quacking sound in Ali's purse, which confuses the two girls momentarily until Aria spots a nearby store called the Darling Duck. Suddenly, Aria gets another FaceTime request on her phone, so she urges Ali to go inside, assuring her that she'll meet her in a minute. When Aria glances down at her phone, she sees a message from \\"A.D.\\" that reads: ‚ÄúMeet me now,‚Äù with a GPS location. She immediately turns and heads in the opposite direction of the store to her secret rendezvous with \\"A.D.\\". Once Aria arrives at the specified location, she makes her way inside a black limo, where she's greeted by \\"A.D.\\", revealed to be Sydney. Aria begins to question her about of all of the things she had done to them, namely shooting Spencer, helping Jenna escape, and creating the board game. Sydney admits to doing so and attempts to lure Aria into A-Team. As the two are talking, Aria notices that Sydney is using an earpiece to communicate with the driver and confronts her about it, revealing that Sydney is not \\"A.D.\\" and is just a member of the team. Sydney reveals that Aria has earned her first piece of \\"A.D.'s\\" trust by leaving Ali and agreeing to meet her in the limo. When Aria questions Sydney's motives for being on the A-Team, she explains that working for their enemy means being a part of the \\"winning team\\". After being dropped off, Aria reunited with her friends but didn't mention anything about her run-in with Sydney. She received a text message from \\"A.D.\\" asking if she had made a decision about Sydney's offer. During \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", Spencer's identical twin sister, Alex Drake is revealed to be the elusive \\"A.D.\\" Spencer questions her sister about the blind school shooting, asking if it was her and Sydney who were there shooting. Alex reveals that Sydney was not there, meaning she previously lied to Aria, and then describes Sydney as merely a \\"one-off\\". Alex reveals she blackmailed Sydney to work for her after finding out that she was stealing from the bank she works at and because she fit the \\"A\\" hoodie.  Reception  When Driscoll was revealed to be one of \\"A.D.\\"'s minions, reception was largely positive. De Elizabeth from Teen Vogue was particularly favorable towards the scene when Sydney offers Aria Montgomery a chance to work with the Liars' tormentor. Gavin Hetherington from SpoilerTV labeled her reveal as an accomplice a \\"sigh of relief\\".

Started as an online- only business, the company has expanded to include physical retail operations. History Near West Side showroom Brideside was started by Lamba and Staple, who met at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in 2010. They founded and incorporated the company in 2012, and it had its major launch in January 2014. The company allows brides to post dress selections online in digital galleries for feedback from bridesmaids and then mails selections to bridesmaids for trials. The business effectively delegates much of the bridesmaid fashion decisions to a Brideside stylist because once the bride has her consultation and posts choices, the stylist works with the bridesmaids. After Lamba and Staple graduated from Kellogg, they moved to Philadelphia to work in a business incubator, but they returned to launch the business in Chicago, which they felt was the biggest bridal market in the country by spending. After operating for some time as an online only business, the operation added a brick-and-mortar presence in the summer of 2014 by moving to the Fulton River District of the Near West Side community area of Chicago. In 2015, the company got $1.5 million in seed funding. In 2016, the company expanded its website operation along several dimensions. In March 2017, the company made its first partnership with a major retailer, Lord & Taylor. In April 2017, the company opened its second flagship location in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company has visions of more expansive product lines. It already markets and sells maternity wear.

It was first located at the southeast corner of Crockett Street and Washington Avenue. James Turner, an attorney and former Confederate soldier, acquired the house in 1866. He had moved to Marshall from Sumner County, Tennessee in 1858. Turner and his wife had nine children and he built a separate structure as a \\"dormitory\\" for the expanding family. Turner became mayor of Marshall. In 1890, his son Robert added the Victorian columns and front porch, after he moved into the house with his new wife. Robert owned the house after the death of his father in 1913. It was moved in the 20th century from Lot 1, facing Crockett Street, to Lot 2, now facing North Washington Avenue. At that time, the \\"dormitory\\" was razed and the salvaged wood was used for an addition of a new kitchen, a bathroom, and another room. The house had been unoccupied and fallen into disrepair several years after being used as an office building by the Harrison County Charities. The house was restored in 1977 by Robert's daughter and last surviving child, Eleanor Turner Gillespie, to essentially its original design; She removed the addition and replaced the roof and damaged plaster. The house was made a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark and a historic marker was installed in 1979. It was also listed as a National Register of Historic Places that year.

Formed in 1995 by an Italian architect, Hotelito Desconocido used an architectural style of that combined both rustic and luxurious designs. It was built on an UNESCO- designated natural reserve that was home to a number of endangered bird and turtle species. The hotel won international and domestic awards for its unique architecture and sustainable energy model, and it was a famous getaway spot for international tourists and celebrities. Its construction, however, created tensions with a local group of fishermen that protested against the alleged ecological violations caused by Hotelito Desconocido's construction and expansions. In 2007, Hotelito Desconocido was acquired by W&G; Arquitectos, a company headed by Wendy Dalaithy Amaral Ar√©valo. She is the wife of Gerardo Gonz√°lez Valencia, a former suspected drug lord of Los Cuinis and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, two allied criminal groups based in Jalisco. After years of resistance from the local fishermen, three members of their group went missing in Guadalajara, Jalisco in 2011 after attending an ecological preservation meeting. They had reportedly previously received death threats from the hotel's management and local farmers who were also opposed to their protests. The hotel was shut down for money laundering on 19 August 2015, when the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Hotelito Desconocido under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. In 2018, however, it was revealed that three months prior to the hotel being shut down, W&G; Arquitectos had sold the hotel to Immobiliaria Anfe, a property management firm based in Jalisco. Immobiliaria Anfe has brought a lawsuit against the Mexican federal government to have property returned to them. Origin and location In 1995, Marcelo Murzilli, an Italian architect and businessman, formed Hotelito Desconocido. His decision to create a solar-powered resort made of clay and bamboo was inspired by replicas of lake villages in Veracruz that he had seen at the National Museum of Anthropology. For three years, he worked with the municipal, state, and federal authorities in the Mexican government, along with locals from Tomatl√°n, to get the construction plans approved. His goal was to make a resort that was environmentally and ecologically friendly. The hotel was built along Costalegre in Tomatl√°n, Jalisco, Mexico, close to a fishermen village known as . This location was in the UNESCO-designated natural reserve area Play√≥n De Mismaloya, on Bah√≠a de Banderas bay, situated between the Pacific Ocean and the Sierra Madre Occidental, just 96.5 km (60 mi) south of Puerto Vallarta. A typical drive from Puerto Vallarta to Hotelito Desconocido took about two hours. Private transportation was available upon request for guests. Hotelito Desconocido was closed for visitors from May to October due to low season. During this time, it employed around 20 people, mostly security guards, carpenters, artisans, and cleaning staff. The hotel opened its doors once the water temperatures decreased during autumn because this was the time of the year when turtles started arriving from the northern parts of the ocean. October to the end of April was considered high season and had a large influx of visitors. The hotel used to employ around 75 people during this time. La Cruz de Loreto also experienced a large number of visitors this time of the year. According to local residents, the town's street food vendors and other hotels were busy during high season. Style and accommodations The hotel had 29 rooms and suites built on palafittes located on the edge of an estuary. The rooms were named after Mexican loter√≠a card riddles; each room was decorated according to the theme of its card. To reach their rooms, guests had to use rowboats on a waterway, and raised a flagpole for means of communication. Morning coffee was given to guests after they pulled a rope from their room that erected a red flag. The absence of mobile phones and telephones was intended to provide an isolated experience. In addition, Hotelito Desconocido did not use external electricity and was secluded from nearby human settlements. During the night, the hosts lit candles, torches, and lanterns to light the hotel and pathways. The illumination of the moonlight was also an intended part of the night experience. Throughout the afternoon, guests were encouraged to ride on horseback along the beach, bike through the palm trails, kayak, and play volleyball or billiards. There were also opportunities for bird-watching and baby turtle release activities since the area had over 150 bird species and 3 different turtle species. Once their day activities were over, Hotelito Desconocido offered guests baths and spa services including aromatherapy or stone therapy. The water used in the spas and baths was heated through the solar-powered panels the hotel had on its roofs. Each room was non-smoking and equipped with small battery-powered fans. The restrooms were open-air and had walls made of bamboo. Frames on the walls were made of unfinished tree trunks. Other furniture and decorations had a rustic Mexican style. Hotelito Desconocido was a boutique hotel and ecotourism resort that pioneered the \\"ecoluxe\\" architecture style in Mexico, which championed rustic architecture along with ecofriendly and luxurious designs. The hotel had daily housekeeping, two restaurants, free breakfast, and courtesy bottled water for guests. The restaurants offered a wide range of Mexican cuisine dishes. The meals were prepared by Federico Tobares, an Argentine citizen and the main chef of the hotel. Most of the guest rooms were painted, tiled, or decorated with Mexican colors or handicrafts. The stools and chairs, known as equipales, were made of wood and leather. They originated from the region's cattle ranchers. Its combination of rustic Mexican decor and luxurious accommodations attracted mostly international guests. Around 65% of the clientele came from the United States. Another 25% came from Europe, while the remaining 10% of the visitors were from Mexico or other countries. During low season, prices varied between $US350 and $US625, while high season prices were between $US410 and $US790, depending on the room of choice. This did not include the 17% tax added on each reservation. Because rooms could book quickly during some parts of the year, reservations were strongly recommended by travel agencies. The hotel also attracted celebrities and millionaires from across the world because of the privacy and seclusion offered by the resort. Hotelito Desconocido's staff and management had a strict privacy policy and refused to comment on the celebrities that visited the hotel. =Awards and recognition= On 18 January 2012, SPRB Arquitectos, a Jalisco-based architecture group led by Laura S√°nchez Penichet and Carlos Rodr√≠guez Bernal, won a contest sponsored by the International Hotel Awards and Bloomberg Television in London for their work redesigning Hotelito Desconocido; the award granted Hotelito Desconocido a five-star status, and was voted by the contest organizers as the best hotel in terms of architecture in Mexico and Latin America for the 2011‚Äì2012 edition. The two Mexican architects explained that their work at Hotelito Desconocido started in 2009 after the owners recognized that the hotel needed major renovations. Since the hotel was initially built using the model, which uses guayabillo trunks tied together and compressed with mud, the owners decided to demolish the original construction and build the hotel on palafittes. It was also during these renovations that the rooms of the hotel were given their individualized loter√≠a themes. For the landscape design, they kept the agave and fruit gardens; they decided to change the look of the entrance and beach by adding 200 palm trees. They also added additional gardens and new sand. On 14 November 2014, Hotelito Desconocido was nominated by Food and Travel Magazine as one of the best hotels in Mexico. They were finalist of the \\"Best Hotel with Charm Award\\" (Spanish: \\"Mejor Hotel con Encanto\\"). On 19 February 2015, Hotelito Desconocido was part of an art exhibition called 21 Arquitectos J√≥venes Mexicanos, relevo generacional (English: \\"21 Young Mexican Architects, generational reveal\\"). The exhibition intended to show contemporary Mexican architecture; Hotelito Desconocido was described as regionalist architecture style that supported sustainable energy. Ecological violations = 1990s = According to a local group of fishermen, the Cooperative Society of Fish Production La Cruz de Loreto, Hotelito Desconocido had violated environmental laws since 1995 and was damaging the ecosystem. Fisherman from the area filed a complaint to the (INECC) saying that the construction of the hotel damaged the jungle and estuary known as Ermita√±o in La Cruz de Loreto. The INECC later conducted an investigation and discovered that Hotelito Desconocido had only obtained an endorsement from the Tomatl√°n municipal authorities at the time of its inauguration. This meant that the hotel had lacked permission to operate from state and federal authorities since its opening. The INECC also discovered that Hotelito Desconocido had been violating several municipal ecological laws since 2010. The hotel was also in violation of a presidential decree issued on 28 October 1986. According to the law, the Mexican government designated sixteen ecological reserve areas along the Gulf of Mexico as well as the Mexican coast along the Pacific Ocean where Hotelito Desconocido was located. The decree also included a number of regulations intended to protect these areas from contamination or other damage. Hotelito Desconocido was located on part of a 69.3 km (43 mi) stretch of beach where construction was legally prohibited. This construction ban was put in place to protect the nesting grounds of sea turtles. By constructing wooden platforms and palafittes on the beach area, Hotelito Desconocido also violated Mexico's Federal Maritime Land Zone Law (ZOFEMAT). Local fishermen complained to municipal authorities that Hotelito Desconocido's construction was illegal and that Murzilli's plans had not been legally approved. However, municipal officials reportedly told them that the investment brought by the construction was important for Tomatl√°n's economy. The group decided to establish a working relationship with Hotelito Desconocido; they allowed the construction to continue because they believed that Hotelito Desconocido would bring new jobs to Tomatl√°n. The hotel ownership was eventually passed down to another Italian national, Giuliano Gasparotto. The group of fishermen stated that once Gasparotto was in charge of Hotelito Desconocido, he ignored the previous concessions and stopped compensating fishermen MXN$10,000 for every day they could not fish in the sea. = 2000‚Äì2010s = In 2009, Hotelito Desconocido planned to build a large expansion on the beach and tried to get two concessions from the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) to permit the construction. The first request was to expand the hotel on the beach by 5,577.1 m2 (60,031.4 sq ft) on one part, and 5,330.9 m2 (57,381.3 sq ft) on another. The petition passed through the Tomatl√°n Customs Agency without significant difficulties. It then went to the SEMARNAT offices in Jalisco, where it was reviewed and passed after they concluded that Hotelito Desconocido met the required regulations. The following year, however, the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP) federal agency analyzed the expansion project and rejected it after finding that the natural reserve area Play√≥n De Mismaloya would be affected by the construction. It specifically mentioned that the endangered turtle and bird species were at risk of harm if the construction took place. On 28 September 2010, the fishermen's group filed a complaint with the (PROFEPA) stating that Gasparotto tried to dig up land with a backhoe in Play√≥n de Mismaloya on 28 July. They stated that he did it without permission and that he had made death threats against one of the group members who opposed such action. Gasparotto's actions were prevented after the fisherman stopped his backhoe from further altering the land and possibly affecting their fishing activities. By 17 August, the fisherman stated that Gasparotto had managed to use the backhoe to alter the beach and that authorities were not aware of this. The fishermen also stated that on 21 August, six members of the Mexican Navy saw that the staff of Hotelito Desconocido were using the backhoe again, but that the staff fled the scene when discovered. Mass disappearance incident Jos√© de Jes√∫s Romero Quintero, the president of the fisherman organization, filed a report to the police on 21 November 2010, stating that he and Espinoza D√≠az had received death threats from Gasparotto. He also complained that government officials were not taking his requests seriously and that Gasparotto was acting with impunity. The fishermen group told the press in 2011 they had evidence of Gasporotto's death threats against them. They filed a video and several documents reportedly implicating Gasparotto to PROFEPA. In one of the documents, they showed that the Ermita√±o estuary was a protected wetland under the Ramsar Convention. Another document asked authorities to investigate the constructions done by Hotelito Desconocido along with the wastewater discharges in the area. On 24 March 2011, three members of the fishermen group, Romero Quintero, Jorge Ru√≠z L√≥pez, and Rafael Espinoza D√≠az, went missing after attending an ecological preservation meeting in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Their family members stated that they were kidnapped by people who knew they were attending the ecological meeting in Guadalajara, and said that state and federal authorities were not interested in helping them locate their relatives. The three men were supposed to go to the (Conagua) after the meeting but never arrived. One of the family members stated that it was difficult to file a kidnapping report with Jalisco officials. = Investigation and aftermath = After they officially filed the case in Jalisco, the family members sent a letter to Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n. Calder√≥n responded to their request and assigned the investigation to the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). However, the family stated that the PGR did not follow-up with them for over a month after officially being assigned to the case. The fishermen group had attended a meeting on 17 March in Guadalajara, where they reportedly received death threats from a man named Antonio V√©lez. The family members believe that the disappearance of their three members stemmed from conflicts they had with Gasparotto and ejido members from Portezuelos, La Barca, Jalisco in those two meetings. According to their version of the story, former Governor of Jalisco Francisco Javier Ram√≠rez Acu√±a hosted parties at Hotelito Desconocido and they believe he might be responsible for the mass disappearance. They also said Calder√≥n visited too. The mother of one of the missing members stated that Efra√≠n Ar√©chiga, the lawyer who was in company of the three men in Guadalajara, did not return to La Cruz de Loreto for six months after they went missing. She believes that his six-month hiatus was suspicious and that he might have been involved in the mass disappearance as well. The fishermen's group provided economic help to the three widows and ten orphan children left behind after the disappearance of Romero Quintero, Ru√≠z L√≥pez, and Espinoza D√≠az. Once Calder√≥n's presidency concluded, the family members sent additional letters for help to President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto (2012‚Äì2018). Gasporotto decided to give up the ownership of Hotelito Desconocido after suffering an accident where he lost his eye. Members of the fisherman group said that Gasporotto left to Uruguay, but lost track of him after he moved to South America. Money laundering activities On 5 November 2007, Hotelito Desconocido's ownership was transferred to W&G; Arquitectos, a parent company owned by Wendy Dalaithy Amaral Ar√©valo, the wife of Gerardo Gonz√°lez Valencia, a former suspected high-ranking drug lord of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and Los Cuinis, two allied criminal groups in Jalisco. W&G; Arquitectos paid US$7.7 million for the land and the buildings on the property; for the construction equipment, they paid US$285,000; and for trademark rights, they paid US$250,000. Each of these transactions included three additional value-added tax payments totaling US$182,250, US$42,750, and US$37,500 respectively. The real estate purchase contract cost US$78,370. This meant that W&G; Arquitectos spent over $US8.5 million dollars (approximately MXN$91.3 million in 2007) to acquire Hotelito Desconocido. According to a notarized document, W&G; Arquitectos took out several loans from , a bank based in Guadalajara, to purchase Hotelito Desconocido. W&G; Arquitectos and V√≠ctor √Ångel Garc√≠a P√©rez, a second beneficiary, received MXN$40 million from Bans√≠. W&G; Arquitectos was formed in 1 April 2005, by Amaral Ar√©valo and her brother H√©ctor Alonso. They created the company in a notary firm owned by Alejandro Sober√≥n Alonso in Mexico City. Both of them were previously involved in the construction industry. According to registry documents, the company was headquartered in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, and provided services in construction, engineering, architecture, and real estate. Its variable capital in 2005 was of MXN$18 million. Amaral Ar√©valo had MXN$5.95 million in stock; Mar√≠a del Carmen Ar√©valo Monz√≥n and Areco Construcciones had MXN$3.6 million and MXN$8.4 million in stock respectively. On 1 January 2007, prior to buying the hotel, Amaral Ar√©valo asked for a MXN$58 million loan from Juan Carlos Cortez Orend√°in. The variable capital of W&G; Arquitectos increased by MXN$73.5 million after this loan was given. Hotelito Desconocido paid the loan back to Bans√≠ on 9 August 2012. For a period of at least 8 years, from the time it was purchased to its closure in 2015, several shareholders passed through Hotelito Desconocido's management. According to local residents, once the ownership of Hotelito Desconocido was passed on to W&G; Arquitectos, they began to see suspicious activity near the hotel. One of the members of the fishermen's group stated that some of the hotel workers said they sometimes saw helicopters deliver packages at the hotel. He also stated that he had seen suspicious convoys of black vehicles in some of the dirt roads leading to the hotel. = Economic sanctions = On 19 August 2015, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned 15 Mexican businesses, including Hotelito Desconocido and W&G; Arquitectos, and 6 Mexican nationals, under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. Hotelito Desconocido and W&G; Arquitectos were charged with providing financial and material assistance to Los Cuinis and their leader Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia (brother of Gerardo), who was responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking operations. Their assets were frozen in the United States, and U.S. citizens were prohibited from carrying out transactions with the entities and individuals in mentioned. This measure was also extended to Amaral Ar√©valo and businessman Fernando Torres Gonz√°lez, who was linked to Hotelito Desconocido. Amaral Ar√©valo was also linked to HD Collection S.A. de C.V., a business managed by her and Torres Gonz√°lez that was also linked to Hotelito Desconocido. According to the OFAC, this sanction was part of a joint effort with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles working with the Mexican government. The intention of this sanction was to dismantle Los Cuinis' business network and uncover the businesses that were operating illegally and laundering drug money. The U.S. government first heard of Hotelito Desconocido through a wire tapped phone conversation between Abigael Valencia and Diana Mar√≠a S√°nchez Carl√≥n, one of his financial assistants. S√°nchez Carl√≥n had been introduced to Abigael by Jennifer Beaney Camacho C√°zares, a close friend of hers and wife of Abigael. Both S√°nchez Carl√≥n and Camacho C√°zares were sanctioned through the Kingpin Act for their alleged role in money laundering. =Closure and aftermath= The same day the Kingpin Act sanctions were made public, the PGR seized Hotelito Desconocido and closed it down. In addition to money laundering concerns, the Mexican government also suspected that CJNG may have used the hotel as a meeting spot for its members. The seizure was executed following a formal request performed through the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit. The National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) also froze several Mexican bank accounts from a previous investigation that they had opened. Torres Gonz√°lez's assets were temporarily frozen in Mexico. The 14 other businesses sanctioned through the Kingpin Act were not confiscated by the Mexican government that day. A few days after Hotelito Desconocido was shut down, local authorities from Tomatl√°n expressed their worries about the effects that it would have on tourism and employment in the municipality; they stated that its closure would impact the economy and make Tomatl√°n less attractive for international tourists, and that it would cause around 100 people to lose their jobs. The Jalisco Secretariat of Tourism stated that one less hotel in town was a huge loss for meeting accommodation demands for visitors. According to a spokesperson from the agency, Hotelito Desconocido had met all the requirements lawmakers had requested of it. He also stated that the hotel had participated in campaigns to promote local tourism. Another local tourism official said that he hoped that the closure of Hotelito Desconocido would not negatively affect the ecosystem of the area (particularly the turtle release programs). On 4 April 2016, the OFAC sanctioned 7 other companies under the Kingpin Act for being associated to the business network of Los Cuinis and Abigael. One of the companies was Status Administrativo, which was linked to Hotelito Desconocido and W&G; Arquitectos. According to the bulletin, Status Administrativo had the same address as Hotelito Desconocido and was authorized to charge its credit card debts on the hotel's behalf. It also managed a parking lot address in Guadalajara that was shared with W&G; Arquitectos. This investigation was also a result of a joint operation between the OFAC and the DEA. As a result of the sanction, Status Administrativo's U.S.-based assets were frozen, and U.S. citizens were prohibited from doing business with this entity. In late 2016, Hotelito Desconocido was put up for sale by the Mexican government's Asset Administration and Disposal Service (SAE) agency, with signs asking people interested in buying the property to contact the SAE.  New management and lawsuits  In 2018, the press published information on the new management of Hotelito Desconocido. Though not publicly known at the time, it was revealed that three months prior to its closure, on May 2015, W&G; Arquitectos had sold the hotel to a man known as Luis √Ångel Orend√°in for MXN$50 million. Orend√°in sued the Mexican government and issued a writ of amparo demanding them to give him back the property, which was no longer owned by W&G; Arquitectos as had previously been believed. According to court documents in a Jalisco appeals court, Hotelito Desconocido was sold by Maribel Torres Su√°rez and Ar√©valo Monz√≥n, who were part of W&G; Arquitectos and had owned the hotel since 2013, to Inmobiliaria Anfe, a property management firm owned by Orend√°in and based in Jalisco. When the hotel was closed by the government, Inmobiliaria Anfe issued a lawsuit against the PGR and asked them to return the property to them, arguing that their firm was not guilty of the wrongdoings the hotel's previous management was accused of. Court documents explained that in 2007, W&G; Arquitectos bought the hotel for US$8.5 (approximately MXN$90.7 million in 2007). The hotel's variable capital was of MXN$72,750 at the time of purchase. Later that year, on 31 December 2007, suspected CJNG member Julio Alberto Castillo Rodr√≠guez became the owner of a significant portion of the firm's shares, owning a stake in the hotel valued at MXN$59.9 million. Three months later, his stake in the firm increased to a total of MXN$152 million. By 31 July 2008, he owned shares in Hotelito Desconocido equivalent to MXN$267 million, and by 30 July 2009 his stake was valued at MXN$515 million, 86% of the hotel's capital variable capital. In 2015, he sold his investments for MXN$11 million, a sum 50 times cheaper than their prior valuation.

It is a sequel to the 2016 film Bad Moms. The plot follows the three moms from the first film (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn) dealing with their own mothers (Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon) visiting during the Christmas holiday. The film was released in the United States on November 1, 2017, and grossed over $130 million. It received mixed reviews, with criticism aimed at the thin story and raunchiness. In April 2019, it was announced that a sequel was in development. Plot Amy (Mila Kunis) is now in a happy relationship with Jessie (Jay Hernandez) and is looking forward to having a simple Christmas. Her plans are derailed when her overly critical mother, Ruth (Christine Baranski), texts her to say that she is coming for Christmas. Meanwhile, Kiki (Kristen Bell) is still overworked with her four kids but now her husband Kent is much more helpful. Kiki is surprised when her mother Sandy (Cheryl Hines) shows up three days earlier than expected and is planning to spend the next three weeks with Kiki. Sandy's love for Kiki is overwhelming, and smothering Kiki. When Carla (Kathryn Hahn) gets home, her mother, Isis (Susan Sarandon), has arrived, telling her she intends to spend time with her for the first time in years. Surprised by this turn of events, Carla is excited to spend time with her. Eventually, Amy, Kiki and Carla go to the mall where they express their misery over the holidays. But while commiserating about the pressures of the holidays they make a pact to \\"take Christmas back\\". Ruth tries to create a spectacle out of Christmas, rather than keeping it simple like Amy wanted. In an effort to tamp down those plans Amy takes the family to Sky Zone to meet up with Kiki and Carla and their families. Ruth, Sandy and Isis all meet and chat while their daughters have fun with their kids. At work, Carla meets an erotic dancer named Ty (Justin Hartley), who says he is competing in a Sexy Santa competition and he asks Carla to be his date, which she enthusiastically accepts. Kiki continues to have issues with her mother's overbearing ways and decides to bring Sandy to Dr. Karl (Wanda Sykes) to discuss these issues. This leads to a breakdown in communication leading to Kiki scolding Sandy and causing her to leave the session. Amy and Kiki join Carla as they attend the Sexy Santa show. All the ladies in the room are impressed with Ty's dancing. To everyone's surprise, Isis gets up on the bar and starts dancing with Ty. Carla runs up to get Ty back, leading to a fight. When Carla brings Isis home, Isis tells her she needs money for a new investment, but Carla knows she's just going to gamble it all away and then disappear from Carla's life like it's been for years. Nonetheless, Carla relents and loans Isis the money. On Christmas Eve, Sandy tells Kiki that she put up a cash offer for the house next door so that she can live right next to Kiki. Finally, Kiki lashes out and tells Sandy she cannot live next door and that she wants some space. Sandy leaves the room crying. Amy gets angry with Ruth when she discovers Ruth has invited a bunch of strangers over to her home to throw an elaborate Christmas party, exactly what Amy did not want. Amy loses her temper and demands everyone leave her home and tells Ruth to leave and get out of her life forever. Her kids, Jane and Dylan, witness this outburst and become upset with Amy. Meanwhile, Carla finds a note from Isis indicating she has just taken off with the money she lent her. Kiki is all alone as well. Ruth goes to church for Midnight Mass and is, surprisingly, joined by Sandy and Isis. All the ladies criticize each other for their efforts as mothers, with each of them realizing their flaws. Amy's father, Hank, goes to her to talk about Ruth and the horrible fight they had, but acknowledging that while Ruth can be difficult to deal with, Ruth has always been incredibly insecure, always worried whether or not she was doing a good job as a mother, but she always had the right intentions and loved Amy unconditionally. Amy goes to the church where Ruth is in order to try and repair her relationship with her mother. The two apologize to each other, with both confessing how much they genuinely love each other. Ruth tells Amy that she is a wonderful mother. The two embrace tightly. As the clock strikes midnight, Amy realizes that she needs her mother to help her fix Christmas. The two rush home to start decorating the house properly. On Christmas morning, Jane and Dylan go downstairs to see that Ruth has returned, the relationship has been repaired and the house looking wonderful with decorations and gifts. Kiki makes up with Sandy, who tells her she put the neighboring house on the market and admits that she's just always felt lonely on Christmas since Kiki's father died. Carla is then visited by Isis, who is serious about turning her life around and has a new job at Sky Zone. All the families get together and Ruth, Sandy and Isis announce that they have become friends and are now planning to take a trip to Las Vegas.

It was originally scheduled for November 3, 2017, but was brought forward two days to avoid direct competition with Thor: Ragnarok. In Australia, the film was released under the title Bad Moms 2. =Home media= The film was released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu- ray on February 6, 2018, in the United States and Canada. Reception =Box office= A Bad Moms Christmas grossed $72.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $58.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $130.6 million, against a production budget of $28 million. In North America, the film was projected to gross around $25 million from 3,615 theaters in its first five days (including $17 million over the weekend).

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Featuring twice the moms but roughly half the laughs, A Bad Moms Christmas is a slapdash holiday sequel that falls short of the original with a disappointing dearth of good cheer.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, down from the \\"A\\" earned by the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a \\"very low\\" 68% overall positive score. Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"A Bad Moms Christmas should appeal to the same‚Äîdare I say it?‚Äîdemo that Bad Moms did, even though it's not nearly as wild a comedy. It has one halfway original idea, which is that when you're a mom yourself, the ability of your own mom to drive you nuts is heightened to the third power, because you're competing on levels that are almost primal.\\" Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it a \\"good time movie\\" and writing: \\"...it goes way over the top, but I have to confess I laughed‚Äîa lot‚Äîand that's obviously the point even if this is not critic's fodder or meant to be. Subtle this is not, but A Bad Moms Christmas is the perfect tonic to lift your spirits and forget your troubles in these dark times.\\" Sequel In April 2019 during CinemaCon, it was announced that a sequel - Bad Moms' Moms - is in development. Sarandon, Baranski, and Hines will reprise their roles.https://variety.com/2019/film/news/bad-moms-moms- susan-sarandon-cheryl-hines-christine-baranski-1203178770/ References External links  A Bad Moms Christmas on Rotten Tomatoes Category:2017 films Category:2010s buddy comedy films Category:2010s Christmas films Category:American Christmas comedy films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American female buddy films Category:American films Category:American sequel films Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore Category:Films scored by Christopher Lennertz Category:Films with screenplays by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Huayi Brothers films Category:STX Entertainment films Category:2010s Christmas comedy films Category:2017 comedy films Category:Films produced by Suzanne Todd ","title":"A Bad Moms Christmas"},{"id":"53945888","text":"Yellow Lake is located by Wegatchie, New York.

She was the third woman to become a mathematics professor in Australia, following Hanna Neumann and Cheryl Praeger. She was the author of several textbooks, and her work on sum- free sets became a standard reference for its subject matter. She helped found several important organizations in combinatorics, developed a researcher network, and supported young students with interest in mathematics. Early life and education Street was born on 11 October 1932 in Melbourne, the daughter of a medical researcher. She earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Melbourne in 1954, while working there as a tutor in chemistry and also studying mathematics. She finished a master's degree in chemistry at Melbourne in 1956. During this time she married another Melbourne chemist, Norman Street, and in 1957 the Streets and their young daughter moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign where Norman Street had a new job. At Illinois, Street took up mathematics again. After moving to Mildura and then returning to Urbana, she completed her doctorate at the University of Illinois in 1966, with a dissertation on group theory supervised by Michio Suzuki. Career After earning her doctorate, Street became a lecturer at the University of Queensland in 1967. While continuing to hold this position, she took a year of postdoctoral research at the University of Alberta, and on her return to Queensland in 1970 was promoted to senior lecturer, promoted again to reader in 1975, and given a personal chair as professor in 1985. At Queensland, she directed the Centre for Discrete Mathematics and Computing from its formation in 1998 until 2004. She has also held visiting positions at the University of Waterloo, University of Reading, University of Manitoba, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, University of Western Australia, Auburn University, and University of Canterbury. Service to mathematics Street became the founding editor-in-chief of the Australasian Journal of Combinatorics in 1990, and continued to serve as editor-in-chief until 2001. She helped found the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications (ICA), became one of its founding fellows, and served as an editor of the Bulletin of the ICA from its founding in 1991 until 2014. She was president of the ICA from 1996 to 2002. She was the founding president of the Combinatorial Mathematics Society of Australasia, for the 1997‚Äì1998 term. She also served as President of the Australian Mathematical Olympiad Committee from 1996 to 2001. Awards and honours The Australian Mathematics Trust gave Street the 1994 Bernhard H. Neumann Award for excellence in mathematics enrichment. The University of Waterloo gave her an honorary doctorate in 1996. In 1999, the Combinatorial Mathematics Society of Australasia gave her their inaugural medal for outstanding service.

The Hollywood films of this period that were scrutinized by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) included spy and private eye thrillers, political melodrama and film noir. HUAC echoed fears that movies could shape attitudes and affect both foreign and domestic politics. Investigators were especially focused on the screenwriter's guild. Screenwriters, in particular, were targeted by interest groups who sought to purge Hollywood of subversive and \\"Un-American\\" sentiments. Nine of the Hollywood Ten were screenwriters and several had worked on wartime films that contained explicitly \\"instructional\\" anti-fascist sentiment. They had been successful \\"planting messages\\" into officially sanctioned projects like Tender Comrade (1943), Sahara (1943), Action in the North Atlantic (1943), The Cross of Lorraine (1943), None Shall Escape (1944) and The Master Race (1944) and thus, it stood to reason, they could also add \\"subversive sentiments\\" into postwar films. The prevailing belief was that the screenwriter's guild was infiltrated by Communists who were trying to use propaganda to \\"subvert the American way.\\" Films deemed \\"suspicious\\" by HUAC were rejected by film goers - some were pulled from circulation. In a preliminary FBI report from 1943, the Los Angeles FBI identified seven released films that contained \\"Communist propaganda\\" and nine other films \\"that have been made or are now in the process of being made but have not yet been released\\" that contained \\"propaganda.\\" The LA office stated that the screenwriters who write \\"propaganda material [are] known to be Communists or followers of the Communist party line.\\" In reaction to the initial hearings of the Hollywood Ten, film studios released the Waldorf Statement where they agreed to create the blacklist barring the employment of Communists. Some blacklisted filmmakers continued to make films. Salt of the Earth was written by Herbert Biberman, one of the Hollywood Ten, and made outside Hollywood with support from the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.

Much of the collaboration's music capitalized on the style of music popularized in Southern California in the early 1960s. They reached the national charts with their song \\"Stick Shift\\" which became the Duals' only Top 40 hit. A studio album named after the Duals' hit song was released the following year.  History  The Duals featured the partnership of Henry Bellinger (lead guitar) and Johnny Lageman (rhythm guitar), two friends who lived in the same neighborhood in Los Angeles. In 1961, the duo approached H.B. Barnum with hopes that the record producer would record them in Hollywood. Barnum, however, had little faith in the songs the Duals had written but recommended them to Ron Barrett, an aspiring producer who recently established his own record label, Star Revue.http://www.starrevue.com/History.htm Barrett was more receptive to the duo's simple, but upbeat, sound influenced by California's burgeoning surf scene. After extensive rehearsals, the Duals recorded \\"Stick Shift\\" and \\"Cruising\\". Not yet satisfied, Barrett audio mixed car noises and police sirens to \\"Stick Shift\\", the intended A-side to their debut single. Sensing potential in \\"Stick Shift\\", Barrett took the single to Sonny Bono who helped the record receive extensive airplay in California. Sue Records bought the master tapes and distributed the single to wider audiences late in 1961. The single, the first instrumental hot rod recording to chart nationally, influenced the popularity of car songs as it reached number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following the release of \\"Stick Shift\\", the Duals performed in Philadelphia and New York City. Despite their success, neither the Duals nor Star Revue, however, received any royalties from Sue Records for record sales until 2004. In 1962, the duo released their first and only studio album, named after their hit song. Two singles, \\"Cha Cha Guitars\\" and \\"The Big Race\\", were also released later in the year but flopped immediately. The Duals disbanded soon after.

Velocity (blue line) and particle excursion (red dots) as a function of the distance to the wall. In fluid dynamics, Stokes problem also known as Stokes second problem or sometimes referred to as Stokes boundary layer or Oscillating boundary layer is a problem of determining the flow created by an oscillating solid surface, named after Sir George Stokes. This is considered as one of the simplest unsteady problem that have exact solution for the Navier-Stokes equationsLandau & Lifshitz (1987), pp. 83‚Äì85.. In turbulent flow, this is still named a Stokes boundary layer, but now one has to rely on experiments, numerical simulations or approximate methods in order to obtain useful information on the flow. Flow descriptionBatchelor, George Keith. An introduction to fluid dynamics. Cambridge university press, 2000.Lagerstrom, Paco Axel. Laminar flow theory. Princeton University Press, 1996. Consider an infinitely long plate which is oscillating with a velocity U \\\\cos \\\\omega t in the x direction, which is located at y=0 in an infinite domain of fluid, where \\\\omega is the frequency of the oscillations. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations reduce to :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = u \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2} where u is the kinematic viscosity. The pressure gradient does not enter into the problem. The initial, no-slip condition on the wall is :u(0,t) = U \\\\cos\\\\omega t, \\\\quad u(\\\\infty,t) = 0, and the second boundary condition is due to the fact that the motion at y=0 is not felt at infinity. The flow is only due to the motion of the plate, there is no imposed pressure gradient. =SolutionAcheson, David J. Elementary fluid dynamics. Oxford University Press, 1990.Landau, Lev Davidovich, and Evgenii Mikhailovich Lifshitz. \\"Fluid mechanics.\\" (1987).= The initial condition is not required because of periodicity. Since both the equation and the boundary conditions are linear, the velocity can be written as the real part of some complex function :u = U\\\\Re \\\\left[e^{i\\\\omega t} f(y)\\\\right] because \\\\cos \\\\omega t = \\\\Re e^{i\\\\omega t}. Substituting this into the partial differential equation reduces it to ordinary differential equation :f - \\\\frac{i \\\\omega}{ u}f = 0 with boundary conditions :f(0)= 1, \\\\quad f(\\\\infty) =0 The solution to the above problem is :f(y) = \\\\exp\\\\left[- \\\\frac{1+i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{ u}}y\\\\right] :u(y,t) = U e^{- \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2 u}}y}\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\omega t -\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2 u}}y \\\\right) The disturbance created by the oscillating plate travels as the transverse wave through the fluid, but it is highly damped by the exponential factor. The depth of penetration \\\\delta=\\\\sqrt{2 u/\\\\omega} of this wave decreases with the frequency of the oscillation, but increases with the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The force per unit area exerted on the plate by the fluid is :F = \\\\mu \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_{y=0} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho \\\\omega\\\\mu}U\\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\omega t - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right) There is a phase shift between the oscillation of the plate and the force created. =Vorticity oscillations near the boundary= An important observation from Stokes' solution for the oscillating Stokes flow is that vorticity oscillations are confined to a thin boundary layer and damp exponentially when moving away from the wall. Phillips (1977), p. 46. This observation is also valid for the case of a turbulent boundary layer. Outside the Stokes boundary layer ‚Äì which is often the bulk of the fluid volume ‚Äì the vorticity oscillations may be neglected. To good approximation, the flow velocity oscillations are irrotational outside the boundary layer, and potential flow theory can be applied to the oscillatory part of the motion. This significantly simplifies the solution of these flow problems, and is often applied in the irrotational flow regions of sound waves and water waves. =Fluid bounded by an upper wall= If the fluid domain is bounded by an upper, stationary wall, located at a height y=h, the flow velocity is given by :u(y,t) = \\\\frac{U}{2(\\\\cosh 2\\\\lambda h -\\\\cos 2\\\\lambda h)}[e^{-\\\\lambda(y-2h)}\\\\cos(\\\\omega t-\\\\lambda y) + e^{\\\\lambda(y-2h)}\\\\cos(\\\\omega t+\\\\lambda y) - e^{-\\\\lambda y} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t-\\\\lambda y+2\\\\lambda h) - e^{\\\\lambda y}\\\\cos(\\\\omega t+\\\\lambda y-2\\\\lambda h)] where \\\\lambda=\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega/(2 u)}. =Flow due to an oscillating pressure gradient near a plane rigid plate= Stokes boundary layer due to the sinusoidal oscillation of the far-field flow velocity. The horizontal velocity is the blue line, and the corresponding horizontal particle excursions are the red dots. The case for an oscillating far-field flow, with the plate held at rest, can easily be constructed from the previous solution for an oscillating plate by using linear superposition of solutions. Consider a uniform velocity oscillation u(\\\\infty,t)=U_\\\\infty \\\\cos \\\\omega t far away from the plate and a vanishing velocity at the plate u(0,t)=0. Unlike the stationary fluid in the original problem, the pressure gradient here at infinity must be a harmonic function of time. The solution is then given by : u(y,t) = U_\\\\infty \\\\left[\\\\, \\\\cos \\\\omega t - \\\\text{e}^{-\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2 u}}y}\\\\, \\\\cos\\\\left( \\\\omega t - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2 u}}y\\\\right) \\\\right], which is zero at the wall z = 0, corresponding with the no-slip condition for a wall at rest. This situation is often encountered in sound waves near a solid wall, or for the fluid motion near the sea bed in water waves. The vorticity, for the oscillating flow near a wall at rest, is equal to the vorticity in case of an oscillating plate but of opposite sign.
