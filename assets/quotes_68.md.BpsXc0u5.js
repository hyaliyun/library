Between 1916 and 1930, she designed houses in Victoria and the surrounding area. Her most noted design is a house built for the Moran family in 1926 called \\"Little Milton\\". Biography Muriel Millicent Stott was born in 1889 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia to Annie (n√©e Twyford) and Leonard Sydney Stott She began her training at the firm of Fisher and Bradshaw and completed her articles (certification requirements) in 1916. She spent the following year in the employ of J. J. Meagher, during which time she built 2 to 3 commissions of her own. One was a brick house on High Street in East Malvern and another brick home in Malvern. In 1917 she renovated a house in Malvern and designed a timber bungalow located in Castlemaine. In 1917, she opened her own practice, probably becoming the first woman with her own architectural firm in Australia. Stott was hired in 1918 to design a timber residence in Olinda on Coonara Street called Rainbow End. The house was built for friends of her family, the Morans, who would later have her build her most noted commission. In 1919 after finishing Rainbow End, Stott built a brick home in Hawthorn. In 1920, she made a trip with her father to the United States and upon their return, built a home in 1921 at the corner of High Street and Malvern Road in East Malvern. In 1923, Stott registered as an architect and in 1926 built another dwelling for the Moran family. The house, known as Little Milton is on Albany Road in Toorak. She built the property in conjunction with Stephenson & Turner and when completed, the home was featured in Australian Home Beautiful. The house was modelled after an English manor house called Great Milton in Oxfordshire. The 1925 design, features a two-story brick fa√ßade topped with a pitched gable roof tiled in terra cotta. The entryway is accessed through a Tudor arch, leading into a grand hallway with parquet flooring. The lower floor has a large living room, dining room, galley kitchen and billiard room and the upper floor contains five bedrooms and baths. The gardens were designed by landscape architect Edna Walling and the grounds contain both a swimming pool and a tennis court. On 20 August 1998 the property was listed in the Victorian Heritage Register. Little Milton may have been her last commission, as though still advertising as an architect, Stott neither joined the Victorian Institute of Architects nor had commissions which have been identified after 1926. In 1931, she went to Europe and met Desmond Leech, whom she married in 1932. Leech was a mining engineer from Johannesburg, South Africa and in 1933 she moved with him there. She designed her home at 39 Currie Street, Oaklands, Johannesburg, which was her last known design. Leech died in 1946 and Stott subsequently married James Davies, an Englishman, in 1955. She died in South Africa in 1985.

In her very first paper, she proved that a generic Riemannian metric on a closed manifold possesses infinitely many closed geodesics. In the 1990s, she proved that the growth rate of closed geodesics in Riemannian 2-spheres is at least the one of prime numbers. In the years 2000s, she proved the long- standing Conley conjecture from symplectic geometry: every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a standard symplectic torus of any even dimension possesses infinitely many periodic points (the result was subsequently extended by Viktor Ginzburg to more general symplectic manifolds).

In this episode, Hook challenges Mr. Gold to a sword fight on the Jolly Roger, while Emma Swan and Henry get the memories of the past six weeks back. In Camelot, Hook casts the Dark Curse. Plot =Opening sequence= The Jolly Roger is featured in the forest. =Event chronology= The Camelot flashbacks take place after \\"The Bear King.\\" The Enchanted Forest flashbacks and the Storybrooke events take place after \\"Birth.\\" =In Camelot= In the Vault of the Dark One, the Darkness enters Hook, making him remember all of the darkest moments of his life, including the time when Rumplestiltskin killed Milah and took his hand, when Rumplestiltskin took his heart as part of a (failed) plan to absorb Emma into Merlin's hat, and when Emma became the Dark One. This causes him to scream in agony, before he emerges outside of the Vault from dark energy, as the newest Dark One. Like Emma, he is greeted by a manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, who offers Hook a chance to seek revenge on the living Rumplestiltskin, but Hook is reluctant to take up the challenge, knowing what the manifestation is, and not wanting to give in to the darkness. David, Mary Margaret, Merlin, and the others search for Hook near the Vault of the Dark One, but they are too late, as Hook is no longer there. David expresses his frustration at being thwarted when they were so close to wiping out the Darkness, but Mary Margaret reminds him that they would have chosen to save their loved ones in any situation, which Emma did. Merlin tells them that this was the darkest possible future he saw for Emma, and that now, their fight to destroy the Darkness had become much more difficult. Merlin sends Lancelot to find his mother, the Lady of the Lake, as she can help them defeat the Darkness. Merlin heads back to the diner, while the others continue their search for Emma and Hook around the restaurant. When Hook says that the manifestation is lying, that there's no way to go back to Storybrooke, the manifestation taunts him by saying that he could use the Dark Curse to return. When Hook says that he would never use Emma's heart to enact the Curse, the manifestation says that for Dark Ones, \\"there is always a loophole.\\" Suddenly, Emma appears as the other Dark One, to convince Hook that they can work together to stop the Darkness by bonding together in love, and their kiss causes the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin to disappear. Later that night, Hook feels the \\"pull\\" of Excalibur towards the Dagger of the Dark One, despite Emma's claim that Excalibur had disappeared. When he calls Emma back, she admits that she has Excalibur, because Hook told her that he couldn't resist the darkness, making Hook furious with her lack of trust in him. Hook tells her that he had always trusted her, and that he was the one who told Emma's parents that she had to decide on her own not to crush Merida's heart in the past, before disappearing. Later on, Emma is forced to summon him with the Excalibur fragment later, just to have a conversation, angering him even more by the fact that she had used Excalibur to \\"force\\" him to come. She gives him Excalibur so that he can be in control of himself and they share a kiss. Emma and Hook arrive at Granny's Diner together, with both of them telling a concerned David and Mary Margaret that they were fine, despite Emma's change in appearance, and with Hook adding that he \\"didn't look like a Crocodile just yet.\\" The others tell them that they can finally continue their quest to destroy the Darkness, with Hook volunteering to get Merlin from the Diner. As Merlin was finishing the message that would be later be received in Storybrooke, Hook appears and locks the doors, revealing that he planned to cast another Dark Curse in order to get his revenge on Gold. Merlin says that this is impossible, since he would have to crush the heart of \\"the thing they love most\\" to enact it, and Hook would never kill Emma. Hook then takes Merlin‚Äôs heart, and the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin morphs into one of Nimue, who appears to see Hook crush the heart. Just then, Emma enters, devastated to find out that Hook has tricked her. Hook says that he had always planned to get his revenge on Gold, and adds that no one will ever control him again, before sending Excalibur back into the Stone to ensure this. When Emma asks Nimue why she was helping Hook, Nimue reveals that Hook had made a deal with her: the Darkness would ensure Hook vengeance on Gold while Hook in turn would help the Darkness snuff out the Light, which devastates Emma. Nimue goes on to explain that when Hook crushes Merlin's heart, it also counts as her crushing his heart, since she is \\"in all the Dark Ones,\\" which will allow Hook's Curse to work. Emma tries desperately to convince Hook to stop, telling him that he doesn't need revenge, and that his happy ending was with her. She warns Hook that if he crushes Merlin's heart, he will destroy his happy ending. However, Hook states that it was her \\"lovesick puppy dog\\" \\"Killian Jones\\" who had fallen in love with her, claiming that his former self was killed when she \\"turned him into a Dark One.\\" Then, he suddenly crushes Merlin‚Äôs heart in his hand, to enact the Curse. When Merlin dies, Emma tells Merlin that she was sorry, before dissolving his body and telling him to rest in peace. Unable to stop the Curse, a heartbroken Emma knocks Hook out, before using a dreamcatcher to erase Hook's memories, to prevent him from remembering why he cast the Curse. Then, at the behest of the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, Emma brings her parents, Henry, Regina, Robin, Belle, their friends and Zelena (whom she reinstalled the magic-inhibiting cuff on) back to Granny's Diner in an unconscious state, before using the dreamcatcher to erase all of their memories, and to add a forgetting spell to the Curse, to keep Hook from ever finding out that he was a Dark One. Meanwhile, in Camelot, Arthur is shocked to find Excalibur's fragment returned to the Stone, and Guinevere points out the cloud of the Curse, which Arthur describes as \\"extremely dark magic.\\" Then, Merida (who was riding her way back to Camelot to fight Arthur), Arthur, and Guinevere look on as the purple cloud of the Dark Curse engulfs Camelot and part of the Enchanted Forest. =In Storybrooke= At Emma's home, Hook, now endowed with the Dark One's powers, starts to embrace his new life in darkness, as Zelena watches in delight in front of an immobile Emma. Upset over what she did to him, Hook takes the dreamcatcher to erase Emma's memories of the events in Camelot, while Zelena places the anti-magic cuffs on her. Mary Margaret, David, Henry and Regina arrive to find Emma unconscious on a couch, and powerless. When she awakens, she tells them about Hook's becoming a Dark One. They reason that they can simply use the dreamcatchers to regain their memories and find out what Hook‚Äôs plans are, but Hook had taken all of the dreamcatchers. At the pawn shop, Hook shows up to challenge Gold to a battle on the Jolly Roger, so that he can finally get his revenge, giving Gold a cutlass to use for the battle, while Hook wields Excalibur. As Gold and Belle alert the others about Hook's challenge, they debate about whether they should leave the cuffs on Emma, and with Henry's distrust of Emma, they agree to leave her at the house with the cuffs, as they devise a plan to stop Hook. Zelena heads to the hospital to find her child but finds only Regina, telling her that the child is Robin's and that their feud has to end. However, she allows Zelena to meet with Robin and the baby back at David and Mary Margaret's loft; she tells Zelena that she hopes that her love for her child will change her, the same way it did for her because of her love for Henry. Vowing that they will never be a family, Robin tells Zelena he will allow her to visit the child, as long either he or Regina are present. Zelena then has her first real bonding moment with her new baby. Regina asks Merida to keep an eye on Emma, only to have Hook appear in front of the archer and knock her out. When Emma asks Hook what he plans on doing, he replies by saying that since he was now the Dark One, he was a \\"free man\\" and now sought revenge on Mr. Gold. He says that he is no longer bound by love or by Emma as \\"a distraction\\" from his true goal. He tells her that each time Emma is in trouble, she pushes away all of her loved ones, including Hook, because she thinks that she can solve all of her problems on her own, and that this trait will keep her as an \\"orphan\\" forever. He goes on to tell her that she didn't need any villains to destroy her happiness, because she was already good at doing that to herself. When Emma asks Hook why he's telling her that, Hook says that he's doing it because he wants to hurt her like how she hurt him, before vanishing. However, Hook's appearance had given Emma enough time to escape, to warn Gold and ask him to succeed in distracting Hook during their upcoming duel, so that she can retrieve the dreamcatchers. Emma then teams up with Henry to form \\"Operation Cobra: Part II.\\" Henry offers to create a locator spell, using a magic potion from Gold's pawn shop. On board the Jolly Roger, Hook and Gold begin their battle, with Hook using magic to repair Gold's crippled leg to give him \\"a fair fight.\\" Despite Gold's efforts, Hook backs Gold into a corner and draws blood with his hook, saying that he will enjoy the final blow. This gives Henry and Emma enough time to find the dreamcatchers, which happen to be located inside the clock tower, only for them to discover that they are protected by a spell. Henry decides to trust Emma again, and uses a magic potion to remove her cuffs, which allows her to remove the dreamcatchers from Hook's protection spell. Back on the ship, Gold is able to take control of the fight, when the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin distracts Hook by telling him to kill the actual Mr. Gold, who seizes the opportunity to drop a weight on Hook and seize Excalibur. When Hook recovers from the impact, Gold decides to let Hook live forever, with the memory of being beaten by Gold. Hook says that his victory was only temporary, and disappears. When Gold meets Belle at the well, she informs Gold she wants to \\"step back\\" in their relationship. She tells him that she spent too many years trying to mend Gold's heart and now, she wants to protect her own heart, leaving a heartbroken Rumplestiltskin at the well. As Emma and Henry distribute the dreamcatchers to everyone and restores their memories, Emma has a realization as she learns that Hook intentionally lost the duel to Gold, so that he could get a drop of Gold's blood. It turns out that Hook planned to use the blood at the pond, for a spell that opens a portal into the Underworld. Hook opens the portal and summons all of the previous Dark Ones (minus Rumplestiltskin), led by Nimue, to aid him in destroying light magic. Production Rachel Shelley, who appeared as Milah in the episode \\"The Crocodile\\", is shown in a flashback scene. Reception The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, \\"All in all, while ‚ÄúBroken Heart‚Äù had its shortcomings, I thought it was a fun episode for Once Upon a Time. Everyone has their memories back, and we‚Äôre right at the point the season started. So, presumably, we won‚Äôt be getting any more flashbacks. Rather, the story will move forward, hopefully, and show us just how the Darkness and the Light will clash. Knowing Once Upon a Time, there will probably be some sort of compromise, but I think it‚Äôd be bold if the show snuffed out one or the other, just to show us what a world without Light, or a world without plot-driving evil, looks like.\\"\\"Once Upon A Time‚Äô Review: ‚ÄòBroken Heart‚Äô Takes Us Back to the Start\\" from Rickey.org (November 29, 2015) Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly notes in her assessment of the review: \\"We‚Äôve got one more week until the winter finale of Once Upon a Time, and we‚Äôre finally getting some answers to what happened in Camelot all those weeks ago. Namely: We have memories! Finally! Which is good because those memories are definitely going to come in handy with what currently is threatening Storybrooke...\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: Broken Heart\\" from Entertainment Weekly (November 29, 2015) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"This week's Once won the day in the small moments. Years of fleshing out characters and their relationships paid off in scenes like the one with Henry and Emma reconciling and Regina bringing Zelena over for a visit with her daughter. We got to see Belle stand up for herself, and we saw the biggest threat of them all introduced. But as far as Emma and Hook are concerned, the story fell short. Hook's fall was too rushed and sort of undermined Emma's turn to the dark side.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.7 rating out of 10. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5.

In this episode, Hook and the Dark Ones try to take over Storybrooke, but in the end, Hook is redeemed, and dies. Also, in the end, Emma, her parents, Regina, Robin, Henry, and Mr. Gold go to the Underworld to bring back Hook. In flashbacks, Hook is reunited with his father. Plot =Opening sequence= The cloaked forms of 11 resurrected Dark Ones are featured in the forest. =Event chronology= The Enchanted Forest flashbacks with young Killian take place years before \\"The Brothers Jones\\" and the Enchanted Forest flashback with Hook and the Evil Queen take place during \\"Queen of Hearts\\", before Hook leaves for Wonderland. The Storybrooke events take place after \\"Broken Heart\\" and before \\"Devil's Due\\". The final scene where everyone leaves for the Underworld, takes place after the scene where Mr. Gold says goodbye to Belle in \\"Souls of the Departed\\". =In the Characters' Past= On board the Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son that he would become the person that he was meant to be, only to suddenly abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, who is now the tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan fell in love with the sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become a better man. =In Storybrooke= Hook, remembers about the last time he saw his father, when Gold arrives to confront him but Hook is steadfast in carrying out his plan. Meanwhile, Emma is determined to stop Hook and everyone follows her and tell the others to split up. Regina and Robin then run into Zelena, who vows to get custody of her daughter, only to be confronted by a group of Dark Ones who then place a mark on Emma's family and friends in a similar fashion. Gold explains to Emma that it is the Mark of Charon, who navigates the ferry to the Underworld. The Dark Ones plan to sacrifice the souls of the marked living, who will replace them in Hell. Then, the 21 resurrected Dark Ones march through Storybrooke, led by Nimue, to prepare for their final battle. Regina confronts Hook at the docks to remind him about what happened back in the Enchanted Forest, but Hook chokes her, saying times have changed. At Granny‚Äôs, Mary Margaret, David, and Henry choose to spend their last hours alive, while Emma reveals her plan to Regina that she wants to sacrifice herself of the darkness inside. Gold then hands over Excalibur to Emma and arranges for Belle to escape town and live her life. Regina and Robin then confront Zelena again ready to take full custody of her and Robin's baby and everything Regina owns once they both die with the others. However Robin tells Zelena that their daughter deserves her best chance with Regina also stating that it's not with her, so she uses Merlin's Wand to conjure up a magic tornado to send Zelena to Oz, with Zelena vowing to return. Emma prepares her plan to confront Hook, who appears at her house, but he has the upper hand after he transforms into Henry, fooling her into handing over Excalibur, which leaves her defenseless. The 21 past Dark Ones, led by Nimue, bring the residents to the lake that will take them to the Underworld, and act as a barrier to keep them from escaping. Hook appears to help Nimue carry out the plan as Emma is left to watch. Regina then reminds Hook that he is unable to destroy Emma's family because he has changed as a person, and urges him to choose what kind of person he wants to be. Emma attempts to stop the Dark Ones from sacrificing her family, but Nimue starts choking Emma, despite being unable to kill her, to keep her from interfering. As Hook watches, he realizes the truth behind what Regina said, and uses Excalibur to absorb all of the darkness from Nimue and the Dark Ones into himself, which also traps all of the past Dark Ones inside Excalibur. Hook then asks Emma to kill him to destroy the Darkness, in order to allow him to die as a hero. A sad, crying Emma goes through with his wishes and kills Hook with Excalibur, which kills all of the previous Dark Ones. As Hook dies, his neck wound from Excalibur returns, and Emma is transformed back into her normal self, with Excalibur disintegrating afterwards. The next day, Belle returns to Gold and forgives him. However, after Emma hears the whispers of the dagger, she meets with Gold, who reveals the truth to Emma, about him using a magic potion to turn Excalibur into a conduit, so that when Emma killed all of the Dark Ones, their magic was transferred into Gold, allowing Gold to reclaim his life as the Dark One, and creating a new Dagger in the process, with a reversed color scheme of a black blade with silver engravings. (Excalibur was still tethered to the Darkness, so when Gold became the Dark One again, the Dagger reappeared.) He adds that he is more powerful than ever before, since he now wields the combined power of every Dark One that ever lived including her. Emma is very cross about this and tells him that she now has leverage over Gold, threatening to tell Belle at any moment the truth about her husband. In exchange for Emma keeping the secret, Gold agrees to help her enter the Underworld to rescue Hook. At the lake, Emma is joined by Gold, Regina, Mary Margaret, David, Robin, and Henry, as they approach the ferry to descend into the Underworld. Reception The episode received positive reviews with many critics praising both O'Donoghue and Morrison's performances. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, \\"With Disney owning Star Wars now, it was only a matter of time until we saw elements of that universe incorporated into Once Upon a Time. The winter finale incorporated a climax that was straight out of Return of the Jedi, and it was remarkably powerful in its application. But make no mistake: while ‚ÄúSwan Song‚Äù is an undoubtedly emotional hour of television, it‚Äôs also incredibly frustrating in how it restores the status quo. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\\"\\"Once Upon A Time‚Äô Winter Finale Review: The Ultimate Sacrifice Is Made In Emotional ‚ÄòSwan Song‚Äô\\" Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly notes in her assessment of the review: \\"From Camelot to Neverland, the show has never quite been able to sustain itself when it‚Äôs simply Storybrooke, as much as some of the better stories have been rooted there. So it‚Äôs not a shock to find out that, after tonight, we‚Äôre probably going to be spending some time in the Underworld next month. We already know we‚Äôre meeting Hercules and Megara; given tonight‚Äôs events, does that also mean we‚Äôre meeting Hades? The bigger (and more interesting) question at stake is the fact that now that we‚Äôre in the Underworld, how many previously dead characters are going to get a chance to return? We‚Äôve already had confirmations of past-dead characters like Cruella and Cora, though both of those characters are supposedly strictly for the show‚Äôs 100th episode. Regardless, moving to the Underworld opens up a host of options for 5B in terms of characters and plot, and I‚Äôm curious to see what those options are.\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: Swan Song\\" from Entertainment Weekly (December 6, 2015) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"The twists in Emma's and Hook's paths carried the episode. Death is an amorphous concept in Once Upon a Time, but whatever ends up happening with Hook, his sacrifice had an impact. The scene between him and Emma was painful to watch; both O'Donoghue and Morrison brought so much emotion to Hook and Emma's goodbye. The fact that Emma wielded the sword should mean interesting twists for her development too.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.9 rating out of 10. Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode an excellent review, giving it a B. In her recap, she points out: \\"It was a fun half-season, one of the series‚Äô best, and one it will be tough for OUaT to top, even with a fun spring break in Hades.\\" Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.6 out of 5.

Banks initially thought it would receive favorable reception from the labels; however, the representatives told Banks that she had not recorded a \\"hit\\" single for the album. Ultimately, Banks ended the record deal with Interscope and Polydor in July 2014. She later approached Jeff Kwatinetz and signed a contract with his company, Prospect Park, which ultimately led to the long-awaited release of Broke with Expensive Taste on November 7, 2014. Throughout December 2014, Banks released a series of videos in which she gave a track-by-track commentary for all of the songs from Broke with Expensive Taste, and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed the '16 Days of Azealia'. During the commentary video for \\"BBD\\", Banks described the song as \\"another one of those records\\", going on to compare it to her earlier \\"rowdy\\" songs such as Fantasea's \\"Fuck up the Fun\\" and \\"L8R\\". She described the creation of the song as a process, summing it up in as \\"I was like, ok, I'm gonna make a trap record\\". Composition Banks performed \\"BBD\\" at the 2013 alt=Azealia Banks \\"BBD\\" is a hip-hop song with heavy trap influences, that runs for a total duration of three minutes and eighteen seconds. Manny Faces from BirthPlace described the track as \\"a musically frantic, bass heavy stuttery-snare Apple Juice Kid/Sup Doodle-co-production\\", while one The Huffington Post writer described the song as \\"Chicago rave meets southern rap\\". HipHopWired writer Kazeem Famuyide thought that the track was \\"EDM-inspired\\", which allowed Banks to \\"show off of her rapid-fire flow\\", whereas MTV writer Phillip Mlynar described the tracks instrumental as a \\"slinky bopping beat\\". Genevieve Oliver from Pretty Much Amazing thought that the track \\"effortlessly amalgamates hip- hop and dance trends (a little trap-y, a little rave-y, Azealia said on Twitter; not to mention the song's title appears to reference Bell Biv Devoe) with her own already-classic rapid-fire, sassy wordplay\\". Maura Johnston from Pop Dust described the track as witch-hop, calling the song \\"minimalist and dark\\". Critical reception The song received general acclaim from critics. Manny Faces from BirthPlace cited the song as an improvement from her previous material, writing \\"It‚Äôs a little harder, a little less sloppy and a little more promising than some of her previous efforts, many of which have drowned in sonic experimentation that, in some opinions (mine), haven‚Äôt done her any favors\\". A writer for PAPER hailed the track as \\"[The] first 2013 party jam\\", adding that the song \\"will jolt you awake this Wednesday morning more quickly than that venti coffee you've been nursing since 9 am\\". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen gave \\"BBD\\" three-and-a-half stars out of five, describing the song as \\"a typically fleet, flashy collection of disses and boasts that glory in estrogen power, Sapphic delights, and the fun of cuckolding stupid dudes\\". Spin writer Marc Hogan thought that the track reflected well on Banks' sense of style, writing \\"With the squiggly high-end and wobbly sub-bass of what we‚Äôre really calling trap-rave now, huh, plus some masterfully timed quiet- loud dynamic shifts, the track displays the virtuosically foul-mouthed rapper‚Äôs usual immaculately stylish beat selection\\". Live performances Banks first performed \\"BBD\\" at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival, on June 29, 2013. She later performed the track during her set at the 2013 Reading Festival, on August 25, 2013. One writer for NME deemed \\"BBD\\" to be a highlight of Banks' set, citing its \\"explicit, bumping rhyme\\". Banks also included \\"BBD\\" on the set list to her Broke with Expensive Taste World Tour (2014‚Äì15). According to Dianca Potts, during Banks' gig at the Irving Plaza, \\"'BBD' and 'Wallace' were similarly received, the audience's enthusiasm building as each second passed\\". The track was also well received when performed in Europe, with The Independent writer David Pollock highlighting it as one of the best received numbers of the night, along with \\"No Problems\\" and \\"212\\".

Early life He was born in Tottenham to Royal Navy officer William Ogilvie of Clan Ogilvie, and Mary White. On 2 September 1858 he married Theodosia de Burgh, with whom he had ten children; he later remarried Alicia Georgiana Loftus Tottenham on 21 December 1890. He and his family migrated to Sydney in 1825, and Ogilvie worked for his father on stations on the Upper Hunter and Liverpool Plains, developing a property called Yugilbar along with his brother W. K. Ogilvie and C. G. Tindal, the son of his father's Royal Navy colleague. Yugilbar By 1850, Yugilbar was approximately 777 square kilometres in territory.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ogilvie-edward- david-777 Ogilvie befriended the local Aboriginals, employing them where they were willing and allowing them their land rights with respect to his. He began buying the territories that would be amalgamated as Yugilbar from 1853 onwards, until attaining full ownership and bequeathing it to his children. Yugilbar has since been sold to the Myer family. Later life In the 1860s, Ogilvie moved from sheep to cattle.

They cover rituals and symbolism associated with the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry in question and answer form. During the second half of the 19th century, the Lectures gradually ceased to be used regularly in English Lodges. Purpose The question and answer procedure was the traditional way in which Freemasons were instructed in Masonic ritual and symbolism before printed ritual books became more widely available.Peterborough booklet 'After the First Degree', Q.C.C.C. Limited, 1990 Usually, the members of a Masonic Lodge would sit around a table and the Worshipful Master would ask set questions of each member in turn to test their knowledge of the Masonic ritual and moral teachings. Replies and questions were stylized and a Freemason would have to demonstrate proficiency in answering the questions about his Masonic Degree before he would be allowed to proceed to the next degree. These catechisms became known as \\"Lectures of the Craft\\" and were gradually developed into a comprehensive instructional system that covered not only the ritual and symbolism, but also the spirit and morals of Freemasonry.Lectures of the Three Degrees in Craft Masonry, Kessinger Publishing, 2010 () Like the actual Lodge rituals, also the Lectures were revised from time to time as Freemasonry developed. History William Preston, from the 1812 edition of \\"Illustrations of Masonry\\" =Origins of the Lectures= From the 18th century onwards, there were different systems of Masonic Lectures in circulation. William Preston's system of Lectures, developed from 1772 onwards, and John Browne's Master Key, first published in full in 1801, were the first to reach a broader audience. By the time the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) was formed in 1813 there were at least three systems of Masonic Lectures current in the London area. =Union of 1813= At the formation of the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) in 1813, the various Masonic rituals then in use in England and Wales were standardized under the supervision of the Duke of Sussex.After the Second Degree: Notes for a Fellowcraft, Q.C.C.C. Limited, 1990 A new Masonic ritual for use by UGLE was worked out by the \\"Lodge of Reconciliation\\" and it was soon realized that the system of Lectures would also have to be adapted, for the purpose of instruction in the new UGLE procedures and to suit the Masonic symbolism to the new UGLE practice. When the Duke of Sussex was asked what should be done about the Lectures, he replied to the effect that the Worshipful Masters of the various Masonic Lodges should adapt their existing Lectures to the new standardized UGLE ceremonies and give them in their own words. Accordingly, none of the different systems of Masonic Lectures then in circulation ever received formal approval from UGLE in the same way as approval was accorded in 1816 to the new Masonic ritual worked out by the \\"Lodge of Reconciliation\\". The result was that the Lectures were not revised and they gradually ceased to be given as part of regular Lodge meetings. Only a few Lodges continued using the Lectures regularly. =Grand Stewards' Lodge= Over time, the version of the Lectures developed for the Grand Stewards' Lodge in London became the most widely accepted. The system of questions and answers demonstrated regularly by the Grand Stewards' Lodge was based closely on the catechism contained in John Browne's Master Key, which itself represented the standard usage of the Lectures by the former Premier Grand Lodge of England. By 1817, this had been adapted to conform to the new UGLE ritual put forward by the \\"Lodge of Reconciliation\\", and arranged into 15 individual sections that were grouped into three Lectures, one for each degree of Craft Freemasonry. =Emulation Lodge= When the regular demonstrations of the Lectures by the Grand Stewards' Lodge ceased in the 1860s, the Emulation Lodge of Improvement, formed in 1823, became the leading body regularly working them. The Emulation Lodge of Improvement has demonstrated the Grand Steward's Lodge system of Lectures continuously since 1823, although rehearsal of the Emulation Ritual has always been its main work. While some light alterations have been made since the 1860s to the version of the Lectures that was originally developed for the Grand Stewards' Lodge (indeed the Grand Stewards' Lodge made some revisions in the early 1860s), the Lectures still demonstrated by the Emulation Lodge of Improvement are largely those which were worked in 1817 and, except for the necessary corrections to fit them to the new UGLE procedures after 1813, they have very much the same content as the Lectures worked in English Freemasonry in the late 18th century.

Gary sounds on great form ‚Äì hear him especially on ‚ÄòNature Boy‚Äô, a testing piece for any singer ‚Äì and pianist James Pearson & his Trio are perfect accompanists throughout.\\"Russell Davies, BBC Radio 2, 16 March 2011 Clive Fuller of In Tune said: \\"I have always found Gary‚Äôs voice to have excellent clarity and here again he sings and phrases songs that you immediately associate with Nat King Cole but given the Gary Williams treatment. In modern day terms Gary is one of the few real song stylists never imitating or mimicking but rather giving his own interpretation of a well loved song.\\"Clive Fuller, In Tune, 24 February 2011 David Ades of Journey into Melody commented: \\"Gary sings in the kind of relaxed and confident manner that can only be achieved by a performer with plenty of experience and bucketfuls of talent. Both Gary and Andrew have deservedly enjoyed considerable success in their careers since 2004, and long may they both continue to regale us with top quality popular music.\\"David Ades, Journey into Melody, 10 June 2011  Track listing   References   External links  * Official Gary Williams web site: Let There Be Love Category:2011 live albums Category:Gary Williams (singer) albums Category:Nat King Cole tribute albums ","title":"Let There Be Love (Gary Williams album)"},{"id":"48365827","title":"Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council, 1887‚Äì1889"},{"id":"48365873","text":"Florian Kondi (28 February 1976, Qyteti Stalin ‚Äì 17 November 2014, Tirana), known professionally as Dr. Flori, was an Albanian recording artist, singer- songwriter, and rapper. Kondi was one of the founding members of the group , which had great success with songs such as Tirona and O √ßike √ßike'. Until his death, Dr. Flori worked with many singers and actors, most notably with Aurela Ga√ße and Ermal Mamaqi. Career =West Side Family (1996‚Äì2008)= Dr. Flori, along with Landi and Miri, in 1996 created the group West Side Family. They wrote and sang their first songs, such as Tik-Tak, and other songs, but in 2002 they sang their first well-known song, which became a hit for their time. Called Tirona, this song was of a political nature and aimed support for politician Edi Rama in the election campaign for the Socialist Party. This song was very well received in Albania and Kosovo. In 2002, the group took part in the K√´nga Magjike show with the song Mesazh. Next year they took part in the contest again with the song O √ßike √ßike' , which later would become one of their hit songs. In the final they took 87 points which was enough to secure fourth place and they won a public price. After three years, more precisely in 2006, Dr. Flori and the West Side Family took part again in the show with a pleasant song, titled Ne krah√´ e tu dua te jem, which secured third place in the final with 215 points, behind Ledina √áelo and the winner ; However, he saved the group from obscurity by winning the award for the best lyrics. Their first participation in the Festivali i K√´ng√´s in December 2008, where the winner would be selected as the representative of Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest for the following year (2009). The group took part in the song \\"Jehon√´\\" written and composed by Dr. Flori himself. In the semi- finals, the group also sang other songs with another famous Albanian singer, Aurela Ga√ße. Ga√ße was also involved in the band's official song that was issued for the final. In the final, they were against 19 other artists, and came in third place overall with 118 points, being defeated by Juliana Pasha and Luiz Ejlli by only one point, and the eventual winner Kejsi Tola by eight points. If they had won, they would have been the first group to represent Albania within the song contest. =Solo career (2008‚Äì2014)= Despite dissolving the West Side Family in 2008 and becoming a solo singer, in 2010, he had successfully collaborated with Ga√ße and Marcellin with the song \\"Origjinale\\", which became the hit of the summer. He continued his success in the next year by launching the song \\"√áa na ke\\", which soon became very popular. In 2011, he participated for the K√´nga Magjike in 2013 with the song \\"S'ma ndjen\\" and became a hit. A month later, he was ready for the 50th edition of the Festivali i K√´ng√´s with the song \\"Personale\\", reaching 8th place. In 2012, he participated in Top Fest along with with the song \\"Passion\\". They reached the semi-finals on 6 June 2012. In December 2012, Dr. Flori again participated in the 51st edition of the Festivali i K√´ng√´s together with the singer Fabi with Jam ti!, reaching 9th place, tying with Rosela Gjylbegu. In 2013, Dr. Flori released \\"Zem√´rthyer\\", a reworked version of Personale. The song was described the struggle ahead of parliamentary elections in Albania in 2013. He wrote his final song \\"M√´ rr√´mbe\\", which was sung by Rezarta Smaja in the 53rd edition of the Festivali i K√´ng√´s. Death In November 2014, Dr. Flori's health began to deteriorate, thus Flori died at the emergency area of the Mother Teresa Hospital. The cause of his death was unclear, but according to the newspaper and other media outlets, he died of a drug overdose. Dr. Flori died at age 34, leaving his wife and two children. The official cause of death in his autopsy was a drug overdose.

The film is based on the novel of the same name written by The New York Times best-selling author Carl Weber. The Man in 3B stars an ensemble cast that includes Lamman Rucker, Christian Keyes, Anthony Montgomery, Robert Ri'chard, Nafessa Williams, DB Woodside, Kellita Smith, James Black, Jack√©e Harry, Marla Gibbs, and Billy Dee Williams. The film was released on November 6, 2015. Plot Darryl Graham moves into an apartment complex, meeting his new neighbors: Connie and Avery, who have a troubled marriage; couple Slim and Krystal, who is Avery's daughter; Ben and his son Benny; and several gossiping women. As Benny helps Darryl move into his apartment, the two become friends. Connie, who initially disbelieves the gossips when they say Darryl is the most attractive man they've ever seen, makes a fool of herself when introducing herself to him. She later encounters Darryl while exercising in the park, explaining that she is trying to get back into shape to save her marriage. Darryl offers to be her personal trainer. Avery angrily quits his job when a promised promotion goes instead to the owner's incompetent son. Drunk and upset with his disappointing life, he contemplates suicide. He is stopped by a wealthy man named Cain, who explains he, too, considered suicide at the same bridge several years ago. Cain offers him a job and shares his life philosophy: one's old life and problems must be left behind at the bridge. Meanwhile, at the apartment complex, Darryl and Krystal have sex, revealing they had previously been in a relationship. Krystal, however, blows off Darryl once Slim proposes to her. Benny counsels Darryl to forget about Krystal, impressing Darryl with his maturity for a 20-year-old. As they talk, Benny finds On the Down Low, a non-fiction book about closeted gay African-American men. Benny becomes uncomfortable and quickly leaves. Under Cain's guidance, Avery becomes an armed robber. After spending time with Cain and becoming intoxicated with his decadent lifestyle, Avery tells Connie he wants a divorce. Upset and hurt, Connie turns to Darryl, and the two begin a relationship. She is surprised when the police come asking about Avery and Cain, searching her apartment with a warrant. Krystal comes on to Darryl, offering to maintain an affair, which Darryl rejects. When Slim catches her coming on Darryl, she accuses Darryl of attempted rape. Darryl's life is further complicated when Benny makes a pass at him, assuming Darryl to be gay. Benny is crushed when Darryl explains he is straight and was only trying to understand his gay brother's struggles by reading On the Down Low. In denial that his son is gay, Ben angrily accuses Darryl of trying to corrupt Benny. At the same time, Avery learns of Darryl's and Connie's relationship. Amid these issues, Darryl is found dead in his apartment after an arson. Detectives Thomas and Anderson question each of the occupants. Eventually, evidence is found in Ben's apartment, and he confesses to the murder, assuming Benny is the killer. The police become suspicious when they learn Avery was seen in the apartment complex prior to Darryl's death, and they press Connie for details, also learning from Krystal that her mother died mysteriously in a fire. Krystal, who blames Connie for her mother's death, is shocked when the police reveal evidence tying her father to the murder of both her mother and Darryl. After making a plea bargain to avoid jail time for aiding her father's escape, she works with the police to set a trap. Three months later, Connie leaves the apartment complex. She hands Darryl's brother's number to Benny, who has reconciled with his now-freed father. In Jamaica, she meets up with Darryl, who is revealed to be alive. Connie flashes back to the day of Darryl's faked death: after being abandoned by Cain, Avery returns to the apartment to rob Connie. When Avery threatens to kill Darryl, Connie kills him, then helps Darryl make it look like Avery had killed him. After Connie leads the police to Avery as a suspect, she helps him impersonate Avery by sending incriminating text messages to Krystal, whose trap he ignores.

Founded in 1932, it is the city's second oldest synagogue. Edmonton's first rabbi was Hyman Goldstick, recruited from Toronto in 1906; he was later elected mayor of Edson, Alberta. The congregation's Hebrew school, founded in 1907, would share space with the congregation until 1925, and later became Canada's first Jewish day school. In 1928, because the existing Beth Israel was overcrowded, a group of men and women decided to hold High Holiday services in the hall of the Talmud Torah, which had been built on 103rd street, just south of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1925. The Beth Israel supplied a cantor and a reader. The idea of a new congregation that would have a more modern approach where men and women sat together was conceived. On October 14, 1932, under the direction of J.H. Samuels, the congregation was formally organized and Rabbi Jacob Eisen was hired as spiritual leader. He gave the synagogue its name, Beth Shalom. After the Second World War, under the direction of Rabbi Leon Hurwitz, a Men's Club and Sisterhood were organized. The concept of a new synagogue building was suggested by H.A (Harry) Friedman and M.I. (Moe) Lieberman with other leaders in the congregation. They began fund raising and bought the lots on Jasper Avenue between 119 Street and 120 Street. The fundraising began in 1943 but the organizers decided to put the funds towards the war effort. The sod turning for the new Beth Shalom building took place on September 15, 1950 and the congregation began to use the partially finished building on April 23, 1951. Early history Edmonton had only sixteen Jews living in it in 1901, but the Jewish population grew rapidly as a result of immigration from Eastern Europe, and in-migration from small towns and Jewish agricultural colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan. In 1906, Edmonton's Jews, in concert with Jews in Calgary, began recruiting in eastern Canada for a rabbi to organize their communities. Hyman Goldstick arrived from Toronto in August to take on the role. Born in Latvia in 1882, Goldstick was Edmonton's first rabbi, and also served as Calgary's rabbi. He was also the Edmonton community's mohel (circumciser), and ritual slaughterer (subsequent rabbis would, for decades, also fill all three roles). On September 16, 1906, the Edmonton Jewish community founded the Edmonton Hebrew Association. Its role was to provide for all Edmonton's Jewish needs, including Jewish education, circumcision, prayer services, kosher meat, and burial. High Holiday services were held in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows hall. In April 1907, the Edmonton Hebrew Association registered the Edmonton Hebrew Congregation of Beth Israel under the Religious Societies Lands Act of Alberta. In May of that year it purchased land for a cemetery, near Clover Bar, in Edmonton's east end. In September of that same year William Diamond was appointed president of the congregation. Diamond ran a clothing business he had started in Edmonton. Diamond would serve as congregational president until 1938, the same year the synagogue transferred title of its cemetery to the local chevra kadisha (burial society). In September 1907, the Edmonton Hebrew Association also created the Edmonton Talmud Torah for the community's five children, and purchased its first Torah scroll. The Edmonton Talmud Torah would operate out of the synagogue's location for over twelve years, and later became Canada's first Jewish day school.

The church is situated in the Frederiksbjerg neighbourhood on Skt. Lucas Kirkeplads by Ingerslevs Boulevard. St. Lukas Church is a parish church under the Church of Denmark, the Danish state church, under the Diocese of Aarhus. It is the parish church of St. Lukas Parish which has some 11.000 parish members. The church was designed by architects Anton Frederiksen and Kaj Gottlob in neoclassical style with a 35 meters tall tower. It was constructed between 1921 and 1926 but the crypt under the church, with room for 200 graves, was opened before the church itself, in 1923.  History  During the late 19th century the city of Aarhus was growing rapidly and the central St. Pauls Parish had become the largest in Jutland. It was decided to divide the parish and establish a new church and at the same time, in 1896, the city bought the Marselisborg estate, intending to develop it into a new city neighbourhood. The state engineer of Copenhagen, Charles Ambt, and the royal surveour Hack Kampmann was commissioned to draw plans for what would become the Frederiksbjerg neighbourhood and the result was a large residential area with Ingerslevs Boulevard as a central, open boulevard to accommodate markets and recreational spaces. Construction of the church began in 1921 and was finished in 1926.  Architecture  The church was designed by Kaj Gottlob and Anton Frederiksen and situated by the central Ingerslevs Boulevard in Frederiksbjerg on the axis of Stadion All√©. It is designed to fit into the overall plan of the neighbourhood and the surrounding areas are reflected in the architecture. The boulevard and Stadion All√© are defined by stringent straight lines and the neoclassical Atletion stadium at the southern end of Stadion All√©. The straight lines and symmetry are repeated in the design of the neoclassical church. Surrounding buildings are 5-6 stories which roughly corresponds to the height of the church tower but while the area is dominated by red brick buildings, the church is made of light gray limestone from Faxe. The structure architecturally presents a monumental appearance with a tall superstructure, dominating tower, large windows, baluster and wide granite stairs. It has a clean, puritanical appearance with few decorations and an open tower with free hanging bells. The church interior is minimalist with few decorations, a wide hall in the nave and a small elevation to the baptismal font.

Palma was known for uncovering alleged corruption within the local government, and he had received death threats before his assassination.  Personal life Pedro Palma was born in Rio de Janeiro, he lived until he was 47-years old. His funeral was held at the Miguel Pereira Atl√©tico Clube.  Career  Pedro Palma was the founder, publisher and director of Panorama Regional since 15 May 1994. It was a local newspaper that circulated in several nearby municipalities. It was distributed in the region around Miguel Pereira, such as Barra do Pira√≠ and Vassouras The newspaper frequently exposed alleged irregularities in local administrations. Five months prior to his death, Palma was using the Panorama Regional to report cases of corruption, embezzlement and lack of public money transfers, mainly involving the mayor Claudio Valente and the first lady and Social Development secretary, Kathy Kozlowski.  Death  Pedro Palma was gunned down by two men outside of his home on Rua Dona Carola around 8 p.m. on 13 February 2014 in the Governador Portela district, Miguel Pereira, Brazil. Two unknown individuals wearing helmets shot him at least three times from a motorcycle, which was recorded by security cameras. According to the military police, Palma died instantly. Palma's body was referred to the Instituto M√©dico-Legal de Barra do Pira√≠. Palma's daughter witnessed the murder. A suspect from Rio de Janeiro was arrested in the case.  Context  According to Reporters Without Borders in 2013, Brazil was declared the deadliest country for press workers on the American continent. Natalia Mazotte quoted the minister of justice Jose Eduardo Cardozo, stating that in 2013 there were 175 cases of violence against press workers. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 31 other journalists were murdered in direct reprisal for their work. Brazil is ranked the seventh country with the highest journalist murders, and the deadliest country in Latin America for journalists in 2013.  Impact  A friend of Palma told O Globo newspaper that Palma had been receiving death threats for many weeks but was not taking them seriously. Palma had been denouncing wrongdoing in the office of the mayor Miguel Pereira, a city located 62 miles from the state capital, and the city where Palma was murdered. The Committee to Protect Journalists lists his murder as confirmed that he was killed as a result of his journalism.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"I am shocked at the killing of Pedro Palma. The toll levied on media workers is tragic and unacceptable, and I call on the authorities to ensure that each of these cases is investigated thoroughly and brought to justice. Freedom of expression cannot thrive under the threat of guns.\\" \\"These murders are sadly indicative of the dangers to which the media are exposed in Brazil. Five journalists were murdered in 2013 and none of these cases has so far been solved. We fear that more cases will go unpunished in Brazil, which one was one Latin America's worst performers in the 2014 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index ‚Äì ranked 111th out of 180 countries.\\" Committee to Protect Journalist's senior program coordinator for the Americas, Carlos Laur√≠a, said, \\"Brazilian authorities must fully investigate the murder of Pedro Palma, determine the motive and bring those responsible to justice.\\" A statement released by the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism said, \\"Everything points to the criminals wanting to stop Pedro Palma's journalistic work ‚Äì a flagrant attack against freedom of the press and an attack on the residents' right to information. Abraji hopes that the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted. Impunity in cases like these can provide incentive for new attacks against the press and its workers.\\" \\"It is very sad when I receive such news, because the journalist's weapon is a pen that prevents him to defend himself. The journalist who speaks the truth and ends up brutally murdered,\\" said JC Moreira, president of the Union of Professional Journalists of Sur Fluminense.

He was granted permanent residency in Canada in 1996 and has applied for refugee status as protection from political persecution due to the accusation of corruption and being considered a fugitive of law by the Chinese government along with his father, Cheng Weigao, a high-ranking Chinese politician. Biography Cheng Muyang was born on November 14, 1969 as one of three children and the only son of Cheng Weigao, who at the time was the head of a tractor factory in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. The elder Cheng was known for his role as the Communist Party Secretary of Hebei province between 1993 and 1998. Ching attended Zhengzhou Industrial College in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan. He later acquired permanent residence in Hong Kong, and in 1996, he was granted permanent residency in Canada. Michael Ching was accused by the Chinese government of having taken illicit commissions for a business deal using his father for political backing. Michael Ching moved to Canada in 2000, shortly before the Hebei procuratorate issued his arrest warrant. In 2006, the Chinese Central Commission for Discipline Inspection concluded that there was no evidence for criminal punishment of Cheng Weigao. After moving to Vancouver, Canada in July 2000, he founded a land development company called Mo Yeung International. In 2002, he founded Sunwins which is a real estate development company in Vancouver. In 2012, Michael Ching received the Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Medal. In 2013, Michael Ching's application for Canadian citizenship was rejected, and as of 2015, his bid for refugee status was denied. Ching denies all allegations and is suing the Canadian government for $1.75 million (CAD) for conspiring against him. In July 2015, a Canadian federal judge ordered that Ching‚Äôs bid for refugee status be reconsidered. According to the judge, Justice Yvan Roy, the refugee panel that denied Ching‚Äôs application relied too heavily on Chinese court findings that had little or no evidence of illegal activity. As of September 2016, Interpol no longer listed Ching as an international fugitive and deleted its \\"red notice\\" for him. Ching has filed legal action against the South China Morning Post and its reporter in the British Columbia Supreme Court for defamation and false statements.

Its founder Baltimore City Health Department official Robert Mehl recognized a need in the community for such services during the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in the United States. He assembled a committee at the direction of then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke, and the organization was founded in 1990. In its first year the organization's staff of three provided food and services to 60 clients biweekly and twice per day. By 2001 this had increased to attending to the nutrition needs of about 550 people in the region. In 2003, the organization launched a program to train people with culinary skills which they could then apply towards gaining employment in the workforce. Trainees in the program included prisoners on parole, homeless shelters, and halfway houses; it graduated 11 people in 2004. By 2004 its staff had grown to 32 with additional volunteers, and gave food to 700 people five days weekly. Initially created with a focus of helping AIDS patients, its service outreach had expanded by 2007 to include those diagnosed with breast cancer and terminal illnesses. It received a $200,000 unrestricted grant from Bank of America in 2013 which assisted the organization with creation of a new distribution center on the Eastern Shore of Maryland to help expand their delivery efforts to people throughout the region. The Washington Post profiled the group early in its existence in 1990, noting it provided vital goods and services to sick people in the region who had difficulty leaving their residences. The Baltimore Afro-American reported on the organization and noted how crucial volunteering was to its success. The Baltimore Sun called it an important group providing sustenance to ill people in the area. Because of their efforts encouraging their employees to volunteer with Moveable Feast, the company SC&H; earned the Mayor's Business Recognition Awards for outstanding community service from the mayor of Baltimore in 2014. History During the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in the United States, Baltimore City Health Department official Robert Mehl persuaded the city's mayor at the time, Kurt Schmoke, to direct him to form a committee to address the ongoing crisis within their region. Mehl, original founder of the organization, was himself diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. Members of the founding committee included Robert Mehl, Joseph Lawrence Myers III, Skip Harting, David Glasser, Yvonne Veney, Esther Baker, and Sean Carriler. Services to the community based on this initiative first began in 1989. After deliberations within the committee, the organization Moveable Feast was formed in 1990. The organization was structured as a nonprofit organization with the aim of benefiting the local community through social services. It signed a US$3,000 contract in 1990 with the Baltimore City Health Department to bring food to AIDS patients. It operated in 1990 out of the Heritage United Church of Christ located in Northwest Baltimore. That year, the organization began providing services of two food portions biweekly to their 60 total clients, with a staff of three people. Its 1990 operating budget was $54,000, and they were provided both office space and telecommunications services via Baltimore's health department. Individuals provided services by the organization began at ten and soon thereafter increased to over 150. Delivery of meals was assisted by fellow organizations Groceries to Go, Ryan White Medical Transportation, and People On the Move. In 2001, after seeing publicity about the organization on television, Karen Brewer was inspired to help Moveable Feast. She organized an initiative of volunteers at her home in Ellicott City, Maryland to bake monthly desserts which she then delivered to Moveable Feast. Brewer brought together approximately 50 bakers from Howard County, Maryland and the surrounding area to bake goods for her project. In 2001, Moveable Feast provided food and services to about 550 people in Baltimore and 13 additional counties. The organization started an initiative in 2003 to teach individuals how to create meals so as to gain employment in the food services sector themselves. Culinary Arts and Life Skills Training Program training chef William J. Antonio told the Baltimore Afro-American that trainees in the program included prisoners on parole, homeless shelters, and halfway houses. The culinary training program graduated 11 people in 2004. Transportation of meals directly to clients was broadened from HIV/AIDS to those afflicted with breast cancer and subsequently other ailments as well. In 2004, Moveable Feast provided food and services to more than 700 people five-days-per-week, and maintained a staff of 32 individuals in addition to volunteers. Victor Basile served as executive director of the organization in 2007. Dietitians craft the quality of the meals for recipients. Executive director Basile described the clientele of the organization to The Baltimore Sun, stating: \\"These are pretty sick people. They're all poor. They're sick, so they don't have jobs. All of our services are free\\". Its services in 2007 were focused on clientele suffering from additional diseases including those with a terminal illness. The organization took up residence in 2008 at 901 N. Milton Avenue in Baltimore. In 2009, the event Gay Expectations Too as part of the University of Baltimore live performance series Spotlight UB, helped raise US$2,400 for the organization. By 2010, the organization's region of service had expanded from merely Baltimore to include all of the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Barcoding Inc. General counsel Jeffery Zinn served on the board of the organization in 2011, and while simultaneously working in its kitchen. He told The Daily Record it was his favorite activity outside of work. In 2013 the organization received a $200,000 unrestricted grant from Bank of America. This was given by its charitable foundation arm, through its awards initiative called Neighborhood Builders. Moveable Feast said it would use the funding to create a distribution center on the Eastern Shore of Maryland so as to better service their clients in that area with sustenance. Additionally the grant assisted the organization to obtain new kitchen capital purchases, and train staff with leadership skills. Commentary In an early profile in 1990 by The Washington Post, the paper described the initiative as a \\"Baltimore organization that delivers bountiful portions of healthful meals to AIDS patients who are homebound\\". The Baltimore Afro-American noted the importance of volunteering to the organization, especially after cutbacks by the U.S. federal government in the amount of support they were previously given: \\"Volunteers at Moveable Feast work as kitchen assistants, delivery drivers, bakers and clerical assistants, and they are even more important now that federal funding cuts have eliminated 5 percent of the organization's annual budget.\\" The Baltimore Sun described it as an important \\"group that feeds the sick\\" in the Baltimore area. In December 2014, Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake recognized the company SC&H; as a recipient of the Mayor's Business Recognition Awards for outstanding community service, because of their annual day of service arranging for their employees to volunteer at Moveable Feast and other organizations. Popular culture Moveable Feast was featured in the 2013 season premier of the television show The Secret Millionaire in which Anne Beiler, the founder of Auntie Anne's pretzel company, masqueraded as a volunteer then made a donation to the charity.

Built in 1908, it originally carried the St. Johnsbury and Lamoille County Railroad line over the Lamoille River. Now closed, it was the last covered bridge in Vermont to carry railroad traffic, and is a rare surviving example in the state of a double Town lattice truss. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history Interior of the bridge showing railroad tracks The Fisher Covered Railroad Bridge stands in a rural area southeast of the village center of Wolcott, south of Vermont Route 15. It spans the Lamoille River in a northwest-southeast orientation, and is accessed from a small parking area just to the north. The bridge is a two-span doubled Town lattice truss, with a total length of and a width of , with an inside track width of . It rests on stone abutments capped in concrete. The bridge is covered by a gabled roof which has a distinctive central monitor for much of its length. The exterior of the bridge is clad in vertical board siding which rises most of the way to the roof, leaving an open strip at the top of the sides. The siding extends into the portals a short way, and there is a band of skirt-style siding extending below the main siding. The decking now has a steel I-beam substructure, leaving the trusses to only support the superstructure. with The bridge was built in 1908, and was, at the time of its listing on the National Register in 1974, the last covered bridge in the state to carry railroad traffic. It was built by the Boston and Maine Railroad on the route of the St. Johnsbury and Lamoille County Railroad, which it controlled. In 1968, it was threatened with demolition in favor of a steel truss. A pier was built under the bridge, and four steel girders were installed to support the bridge's load.

With Amundsen In the summer of 1910, Beck boarded the polar schooner Fram as an ice captain for Roald Amundsen's planned North Pole expedition. Few people knew that Amundsen had already planned a \\"detour\\" to the South Pole, and that Beck was actually brought in to guide the \\"Fram\\" through the southern polar ice.Flaherty, Leo. 1992. Roald Amundsen and the Quest for the South Pole. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, p. 76. He signed a contract with Amundsen in April 1909, after Amundsen had been informed that his friend Frederick Cook had reached the North Pole, which was Amundsen's real goal. Beck was recommended by Amundsen's friend and contact man in Tromso, the pharmacist and Morgenbladet correspondent Fritz Gottlieb Zapffe. Amundsen even traveled to Troms√∏ to obtain Beck's signature on the contract. From Oslo, the Fram sailed to Madeira, where Beck and the rest of the crew were informed about the change of plans and were given the opportunity to withdraw from the expedition. All of them chose to continue. After having guided the Fram through the polar ice much faster than anticipated and landing the expedition at the Bay of Whales in January 1911, Beck and the Fram departed for an oceanographic cruise lasting several months in the South Atlantic. Helmer Hanssen, one of the five men that Amundsen chose to accompany him to the South Pole, wrote the following in his book Gjennem Isbaksen. Atten √Ör med Roald Amundsen (Through the Ice-Packs. Eighteen Years with Roald Amundsen): \\"Beck was a giant of a figure and, as usual for large, strong people, he had an outstanding good humor. Despite his size, nobody was faster in the rigging. He had that quality that certain ice captains have‚Äîhe could sense the ice moving. Amundsen held Beck in high esteem and, when Beck had an opinion or suggestion, Amundsen went along with it.\\" In January 1912, Beck and the Fram returned to the Bay of Whales and retrieved the expedition, which had planted the Norwegian flag at the South Pole on December 14, 1911. They then traveled to Hobart, Tasmania and on to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where the Fram was laid up to await the expeditions continuation to the North Pole. In Buenos Aires, Norway's special envoy and plenipotentiary minister to Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, Peter \\"Don Pedro\\" Christophersen, hosted a celebration and the expedition was awarded a medallion from the Norwegian La Plata Society. Beck and the rest of the crew traveled by passenger steamer to Oslo, where they were received by the king, and they received the Norwegian South Pole Medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), established by King Haakon to commemorate the expedition.Store norske leksikon: Sydpolsmedaljen. Amundsen also gave each of the expedition participants a gold pocket watch decorated with the expedition participant's monogram and the inscription \\"Fram 1910‚Äì1912.\\" Beck received the King's Medal of Merit in gold in 1912. Death In 1913, Beck traveled to Buenos Aires to inspect the Fram in preparation for Amundsen's expedition to the north. The journey took him to Panama, where the intention was to go through the new Panama Canal. However, difficulties with the canal work would have created too long a delay, and they decided to go south and around Cape Horn instead. Along the way, Beck fell ill and died on March 18, 1914. Beck was buried at sea (at 33¬∞30‚Ä≤ S 49¬∞30‚Ä≤ W) outside Montevideo, Uruguay.Bomann-Larsen, Tor. 2006. Roald Amundsen. Transl. Ingrid. Christophersen. Stroud, UK: The History Press, pp. 161‚Äì162. Amundsen was in Norway at the time and, for various reasons, canceled the expedition and sailed Fram back to Norway, which would be the vessel's last voyage. Amundsen traveled in person to Troms√∏ to offer his condolences to Beck's family and he gave Beck's widow Josephine NOK 10,000. Beck Peak On Amundsen's map of the South Pole, Beck was honored by having a mountain named after him. Amundsen named an elevation at 87¬∞20‚Ä≤ S 148¬∞0‚Ä≤ E Andreas Becks Top (Andreas Beck Peak).

It is a parish church in the √Öby Parish along with √Öby Church and serves some 11.000 parish members. The church was designed by the Danish architect Harald L√∏nborg-Jensen and inaugurated in 1945. The church is architecturally linked with a church in L√∏gumkloster from which L√∏nborg-Jensen drew inspiration. The original church spire featured a fl√®che but as construction took place during the Second World War there was a shortage of lead and copper which meant it could not be properly finished. In 1973 it suffered from rot and was replaced with a new and slimmer version. In the interior the altar faces north and is made of grey and yellow travertine and adorned with a gilded crucifix. Colors are kept discrete throughout the church and the floor is paved in red brick. In 1994 the church got a new organ and new windows in the choir. The church has a cemetery which was inaugurated on 16 November 1927 with the first burial taking place December 23 of that year. The cemetery is divided around a system of paths which splits the cemetery into smaller units.

In August 2007, upon the sudden retirement of Ram√≥n H. Dovalina, Maldonado assumed the LCC presidency. Maldonado retired from LCC effective August 1, 2016. LCC trustee elections In the fall of 2014, Maldonado became actively involved in LCC trustee elections when he stood on street corners and wrote two letters to the Laredo Morning Times to express support for two candidates, Jackie L. Ramos and Ed Gonzalez, who ran, respectively, against trustees Jesse Porras, a former LCC employee, and Hilario Cavazos, Jr., a former educator with the Laredo Independent School District. Maldonado also endorsed Carlos Carranco, Jr., for a seventh term as trustee, but Carranco was unseated by Tita Cantu Vela, a former LCC employee. Porras and Cavazos subsequently lost their reelection bids to Jackie Ramos and Michelle de la Pe√±a, respectively. The defeats of Porras and Cavazos were considered major victories for Maldonado. In October 2014, Maldonado took nearly two weeks of leave time while the trustee campaign was underway, in his words, \\"to reinstate a sense of professional decorum and integrity to our beloved LCC and its governing board.\\" He affirmed that his leave time was not directly related to the trustee election campaign. Because of his political involvement, a letter writer to the Laredo Morning Times called for Maldonado to step down immediately.Intelius.com lists fourteen \\"Rudy Ramirezes\\" in Laredo, Texas; the \\"Letter to the Editor\\" gives no middle name or address by which to identify the person. The Laredo Morning Times questioned Maldonado's politicking in trustee elections; its education reporter, Judith Rayo, suggested that he could have been \\"walking on thin ice\\" legally in support of the three favored candidates, noting that in 1992 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans upheld the firing of a school superintendent for similar \\"electioneering\\". After the November elections, the board in 2014 elected three new officers, with Hilario Cavazos as the temporary board president to succeed Cynthia Mares, but Cavazos' defeat at the polls a few weeks later in the runoff contest removed him from the ranks of the trustees. During his short tenure as board president, Cavazos was served a temporary restraining order initiated by fellow trustee Mercurio Martinez, a former county judge for Webb County, to block the board from reviewing the employment contracts of two employees accused of engaging in sexual relations on campus. Hilario Cavazos accused President Maldonado of \\"covering up a scandal, and he didn't do anything about it. I owed it to the public to try to correct this.\\" In April 2015, Maldonado banned Cavazos from being on the LCC campus for fourteen days because of what Maldonado termed the former trustee's disruptive behavior at a public meeting on January 22. =Nora Stewart case= In January 2015, Maldonado suspended with pay LCC chief financial officer Nora Stewart, another member of his management teamOther Maldonado management team members were Vincent R. Solis, vice president for instruction and student services; Luciano Ramon, information technology officer, and Nora Ramirez Garza, a former reading instructor and the vice president for resource development in charge of grantsmanship. whom he claimed misused her staff to obtain an undisclosed college document that Maldonado considered to be \\"confidential.\\" Her attorney, George Altgelt, subsequently elected to one of the eight seats on the Laredo City Council, said that Stewart had been \\"retaliated against for doing exactly what her job requires her to do.\\" Stewart claims that Maldonado belittled her as \\"Miss Righteous\\" and then said in question form, \\"You are now the \\"auditor?\\", rather than the title of chief financial officer. Without revealing details of the investigation conducted into the Stewart matter by a McAllen firm, Anderson and Walsh, the trustees on May 18, 2015, directed the administration and its attorney to prepare an \\"amicable agreement\\" for Stewart's separation from the college. Stewart joined LCC in 2002; she was previously the asset management officer.Judith Rayo, \\"Financial officer may be on way out\\", Laredo Morning Times, May 19, 2015, pp. 1, 12A. However, the trustees reversed course and voted 5-3 to renew Stewart's contract for another year. Altgelt had threatened to sue the members individually had they not done so. Stewart had also clashed with preceding President Ram√≥n Dovalina, whom she accused, along with the then the retiring chief financial officer Daniel J. \\"Dan\\" Flores, Jr. (1938-2016), of \\"retaliation, verbal abuse, harassment, mental anguish, creation of a hostile work environment, and excessive stress and harm to her professional reputation.\\" Dovalina announced his pending departure within a month of the raising of Stewart's allegations.Tricia Cortez, \\"LCC feud: Auditor's complaint against President, CFO alleges retaliation, harassment\\", Laredo Morning Times, February 23, 2007, pp. 1, 12A Stewart continued in her position when Maldonado succeeded Dovalina.Laredo Community College 2007-2008 Catalog, pp. 309, 312 President Juan L. Maldonado (left) converses on September 15, 2010, with Jesse Poras, then the incoming LCC trustee, at the groundbreaking of the Rodney Lewis Education and Academic Center. Four years later, Maldonado campaigned successfully to defeat Porras in the trustee elections. Maldonado announced his own retirement several months thereafter. =Retirement issues= In June 2015, the LCC trustees took formal action not to extend the president's contract for another year. This action forced Maldonado to retire earlier than he had planned. Successor In May 2016, the trustees voted 6-1, with two members absent, to name as Maldonado's successor Ricardo Solis, the former dean of academic, professional, and technical education at GateWay Community College in Phoenix, Arizona. A month later, the trustees bought out the last remaining month of Maldonado's contract and hired Solis as the replacement under a three-year contract at an annual salary of $180,000. Maldonado had started as president with $150,000 in annual compensation in 2007.Tricia Cortez, \\"LCC ups perks; Board gives additional $3,000 per month to incoming president\\", Laredo Morning Times, April 21, 2007, p. 1. Upon his departure from LCC, Maldonado received some $100,000 in unused sick leave and vacation days. In 2017, Juan and Linda Maldonado were residing in San Antonio, Texas, where he died the following year. His obituary was published in the Spanish language edition of The Laredo Morning Times. U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas' 28th congressional district, who worked with Maldonado on various college projects, called him a \\"great leader and visionary\\" whose work greatly benefited the students.

He became an influential Jainism scholar and comparative religion writer between 1910s and 1930s who translated and interpreted Digambara texts. In early 1920s, he became religiously active in India and published essays and articles defending Jainism against misrepresentations by colonial era Christian missionaries, contrasting Jainism and Christianity. He founded Akhil Bharatvarsiya Digambara Jain Parisad in 1923 with the aim of activist reforms and uniting the south Indian and north Indian Digambara community. He visited various European countries to give lectures on Jainism. He was conferred with the title Vidya-Varidhi (lit. Ocean of Wisdom) by Bharata Dharma Mahamandal (The India-Religious Association).  Life  Champat Rai Jain was born on 6 August 1867 in Delhi, India. He was married at the age of 13. In 1892, he went to England to study law, and became a barrister. Champat Rai Jain was a Digambara, whose writings represent that sect's propaganda with his personal interpretations, according to Robert Williams. Jain became a part of a Digambara group presenting Digambara point of view in the 1920s and 1930s such as with Jagadarlal Jaini, Nathuram Premi, Jugalkishor Mukhtar and Hiralal Jain. Jain was the founder of the Jaina mission in London. He died on 2 June 1942. He was a barrister-at-law, orator, writer, and attempted to explain Jainism with modern age psychology and science terminology. According to Padmanabh Jaini, the colonial-era Champat Rai Jain was an apologist of Jainism, defended the Jain doctrines that were criticized by Christian missionaries, and authored the first Jaina text aimed at the Christian world when Christian missionaries were extremely frustrated at Jain people they understood to have \\"no pagan gods\\" and refused to convert to Christianity. He was among the early 20th-century Jain activists who participated in the colonial discussion about whether Jains are culturally Hindus or a minority community. He became a part of Digambara activists who sought to energize and reform Digambara community. He participated in several Digambara societies, and founded Akhil Bharatvarsiya Digambara Jain Parisad in 1923 with the aim of activist reforms, reducing caste divisions within Jainism, and uniting the south Indian and north Indian Digambara community.  Lectures  Champat Rai Jain attempted to present Jainism as a scientific religion: * Jaina Doctrine - Lecture delivered before the \\"Association des Amis de l'Orient\\" (Paris) on 28 November 1926 * Jainism And Its Power To Stop Human Warfare- Lecture delivered before \\"Le Trait d'Union\\" Society at Nice * Religion and Comparative Religion- Lecture delivered at Genova, Italy (6 January 1927) * Ahimsa as the Key to World Peace at the World Fellowship of Faiths (1933)  Publications  Champat Rai Jain wrote in three main languages of his time: English, Hindi, Urdu. According to Williams, the translations of Champat Rai Jain were of \\"no high merit\\", he added his own interpretation often \\"disfiguring the sense of the original\\" Jain texts about monastic life and doctrines for Jain laypeople. *The Key of Knowledge (1915, 1919, 1928) *The Householder's Dharma (1917): English translation of the Jain text, Ratnakaranda ≈õrƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅra. *The Practical Dharma (1929)- Second edition of \\"The Practical Path\\" (1917) Alt URL *Confluence of Opposites (1921) *The Jain Law (1926) ** *Nyaya- The Science of Thought (1916, 1924) *Jainism, Christianity and Science (Allahabad, 1930) *The Lifting Of The Vell or The Gems Of Islam (1931) Alt URL *The Practical Dharma (1929) *Risabha Deva- The Founder of Jainism (1929, 1935) *Sannyasa Dharma (1926) * ;Essays and Addresses *What is Jainism (Essays and Addresses- I) *Jainism and World Problems (Essays and Addresses- II) *The Change of Heart (Essays and Addresses- III) = Hindi = * Jain Law * Sanatana Jain Dharma = Urdu = *Jawahrat-e-Islam Gallery Confluence of opposites.JPGConfluence of opposites (1921) book authored by C.R.

The temple has a clear view overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Channel Islands of California. The Vedanta Temple is part of the Vedanta Society of Southern California and is a Western branch of the Ramakrishna Order of India.  Facilities & Activities  The temple bell dates approximately to the period of the Sung dynasty (circa 960-1279). Facilities adjacent to the temple include; a bookstore, a shaded sitting area for congregating after services, and a 12th-century bronze Japanese-cast temple bell (which was once fastened to a Chinese military ship) that is rung three times per day at dawn, noon, and dusk. A path behind the temple leads up a hill to a pavilion where classes are held with the swamis and the nuns. The temple is open daily to the public. A convent of nuns manage the bookstore, oversee maintenance of the grounds, and facilitate the temple's public activities; including daily worship (i.e. Puja), meditation, and vesper services (i.e. Arati). There are also regular Sunday lectures and pujas. The temple hours run from 6:30 am to 7:00 pm every day with a daily puja, and arati at 6:00 pm. Sunday lectures are at 11:00 am. The bookstore is open Monday through Saturday (except on Wednesdays) from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, and on Sundays from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm. The inner sanctum of the temple is adorned with a 44\\" x 50\\" oil on canvas painting of the Indian Paramahansa and yogi Sri Ramakrishna, painted by Swami Tadatmananda (1932-2008) in 1962. (Revised from an entry in Vedanta Voices, February, 2008)  History  The temple was built on a mostly undeveloped estate donated by Spencer Kellogg to the Vedanta Society of Southern California in 1944. The property was largely covered with thick chaparral shrub, and included a house, a small shrine building, and an art room. Swami Prabhavananda (the founder of the Vedanta Society of Southern California) first met Spencer Kellogg in 1941 through Swami Nikhilananda. It has been published that Kellogg offered the property on two occasions to Swami Prabhavananda, but was turned down due to the Swami's concern for possible financial imprudence or solecism. However, he eventually changed his mind on the following account: Initially the property was used as a retreat for monks, nuns, and lay members of the Vedanta Society in Hollywood. From 1946-47, a retired contractor and a group of monks constructed four bedrooms surrounding the art room. In 1947, the estate was then designated as a full-time convent for a group of nuns from the Hollywood Center. The first monastic vows were given to three of the convent members. In 1954, the first public lectures were given in the living room of the main house. It was soon determined that a temple was needed to accommodate some seventy regular attendees. The temple was constructed and dedicated in 1956. In 1959, the temple became the venue for taking the vows of sannyas for women in America for the first time by the Ramakrishna Order of India. In 1970, at the request of architect Lutah Maria Riggs, Daniel Donahue (an associated client) donated a large bronze soft-green patina-tarnished Chinese bell to the Santa Barbara Temple. Said to produce \\"deeply resonant tones\\", the bell is estimated to date approximately to the era of the Sung dynasty (circa 960-1279).  Architecture  Interior view of the temple The temple was designed by Lutah Maria Riggs (1896-1984) who styled the structure after the ancient wooden temples of South India, along with Japanese and Chinese architectural styles. Surrounding the temple there are rock gardens with native plant species, which were landscaped by Riggs with guidance from renown architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Serving as an example to international architects, the building has received several awards for its design. The temple has thus been described: Riggs had also designed the temple lanterns (1960) and other structures on the temple grounds, including the gatehouse (1958‚Äì59, 1963), a carport (1960), the pavilion (1960, 1964‚Äì65), and the Eva Herrmann House (1968‚Äì70). Years later she conveyed that initially she had a limited grasp of oriental architecture before delving into various literature on the topic, which included; \\"Japanese Houses and their Surroundings\\" by Edward S. Morse (published 1886), and \\"Impressions of Japanese Architecture\\" by Ralph Adams Cram (published 1905), as well as other literature on Chinese and Japanese landscape architecture, including \\"Gardens of China\\" by Osvald Sir√©n (published 1949) An architectural analysis describes the temple as a work of both traditionalism and modernism: References  External links  * Santa Barbara Temple - Photo Gallery Category:Montecito, California Category:Hindu temples in California Category:Indian-American culture in California Category:Religious buildings and structures in Santa Barbara County, California Category:1956 establishments in California Category:Buildings and structures in Santa Barbara County, California ","title":"Santa Barbara Vedanta Temple"},{"id":"48368763","text":"Justin Daniel \\"JD\\" Rossetti (born November 12, 1981) is an American politician of the Democratic Party.

Among the vampires, Wong Ching (Jude Poyer) and Jenny (Emana Leung) were a pair of lovers whom were poisoned to death. The imperial government is still tracking the killer. Since the killer was worried that his crimes will be brought to light, he hires black magician Ha Lai-cheuk (Yuen Wah) to destroy the corpses. However, this case involves a secret letter written by the emperor, thus, Ha orders his followers, Mo and Ma to find the whereabouts of the letter. Mo and Ma were never fond of one another. In order to get his job done, Ha secretly alienates them from one another and causes internal conflict between the two.

Summary The Castle Perilous series revolves around Castle Perilous (the name is drawn from the Siege Perilous of Arthurian fable), whose lord is Incarnadine, a sorcerer. 144,000 doors (or \\"aspects\\") of the Castle each lead to another parallel universe. Some of these dimensions are magical, while others have little or no magic; one of the latter is Earth. Those who find themselves at the Castle often stay to become residents, and (to their surprise) develop a magical power of their own.

The way modern physicians approach healing of the sick differs greatly from the methods used by early general healers or elite physicians like Hippocrates or Galen. In modern medicine, the understanding of disease stems from the ‚Äúgerm theory of disease‚Äù, a concept that emerged in the second half of the 19th century, such that a disease is the result of an invasion of a microorganism into a living host. Therefore, when a person becomes ill, modern treatments ‚Äútarget‚Äù the specific pathogen or bacterium in order to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù or ‚Äúkill‚Äù the disease. In Ancient Greece and Rome, disease was literally understood as dis-ease, or physical imbalance. Medical intervention, therefore, was purposed with goal of restoration of harmony rather than waging a war against disease. Surgery was regarded by Greek and Roman physicians as extreme and damaging while prevention was seen as the crucial first step to healing almost all ailments. In both prevention and treatment of disease in classical medicine, food and diet was central. The eating of correctly-balanced foods made up the majority of preventative treatment as well as to restore harmony to the body after it encountered disease.  Food and Diet in Ancient Greece  = Humours and Causes of Disease = Ancient Greek Medicine is described as rational, ethical and based upon observation, conscious learning and experience. Superstition and religious dogmatism are often excluded from descriptions of ancient Greek medicine. It is important, however, to note that this rational approach to medicine did not always exist in the ancient Greek medical world, nor was it the only popular method of healing. Along with rational Greek medicine, disease was also thought of as being of supernatural origin, resulting from the unhappiness of the gods or from demonic possession. Exorcists and religious healers were among the ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô that patients sought out when they became ill. Sacrifices, exorcisms, spells and prayers were then carried out in order to reconcile with the gods and restore health to the patient. It was not until the time of Hippocrates, between 450 and 350 BC, that rational, observation and the humoral theory of medicine began to become highly influential. The theory of the humours or ‚ÄúHumorism‚Äù understood the human body to be composed of fluid (humours) and regarded disease as a result of an imbalance of the four humors: yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood.The four humours and their qualities These humours contain qualities such as hot, cool, moist, dry, etc., which must also remain in balance. Foods can be heating, cooling, or generative of one humour. Some foods produce good juices and others bad juices and often cooking and preparation of the foods can change or improve the juices of the foods. In addition, foods may be easy to assimilate (easy to pass through the body), easily excreted, nourishing or not nourishing. In Hippocratic medicine, the qualities in foods are analogous to the four humors in the body: too much of a single one is bad, a proper mixture is ideal. Therefore, the consumption of correctly-balanced foods and life- style of the patient was crucial to the prevention and treatment of disease in Ancient Greece. This brings us to the way in which seasonal food played an important role in the treatment of ancient disease. According to the Hippocratic author of ‚ÄúAirs, Waters and Places‚Äù (there remains debate as to whether Hippocrates himself wrote the Hippocratic Corpus), it is important that a physician learn astronomy because, ‚Äúthe changes of the seasons produce changes in diseases,‚Äù. In the same Hippocratic text, the author goes on to explain that villages facing east and that are exposed to winds from the north-east, south-east and west tended to be healthy and, ‚ÄúThe climate in such a district may be compared with the spring in that there are no extremes of heat and cold. As a consequence, diseases in such a district are few and not severe,‚Äù. As an example of the importance of seasonal food on maintaining balance of the humours and preventing disease is given by Hippocrates in ‚ÄúOn Regimen‚Äù when the authors state that, ‚Äúin winter, to secure a dry and hot body it is better to eat wheaten bread, roast meat, and few vegetables; whereas in summer it is appropriate to eat barley cake, barley meat and softer foods,‚Äù (qtd. in Wilkins et al., p. 346). = Food and Diet in the Hippocratic Aphorisms = Food and diet feature prominently in the aphorisms of the Hippocratic Corpus. For example, in one aphorism in the first section, Hippocrates states, ‚ÄúThings which are growing have the greatest natural warmth and, accordingly, need most nourishment. Failing this the body becomes exhausted. Old men have little warmth and they need little food which produces warmth; too much only extinguishes the warmth they have. For this reason, fevers are not so acute in old people for then the body is cold‚Äù. Another aphorism says, ‚ÄúIt is better to be full of drink than full of food‚Äù. And finally, an aphorism that generally sums up treatment of disease in Hippocratic times states, ‚ÄúDisease which results from over-eating is cured by fasting; disease following fasting, by a surfeit. So with other things; cures may be effected by opposites,‚Äù. This concept of treating diseases opposite to the way it manifests in the individual is concept that is carried over into Roman medicine. = Gout in Ancient Greece = Gout was called podagra in ancient Greek medicine and is a common arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within the joints. Gout usually affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe and later the other joints of the feet and hands. Hippocrates considered gout to be the result of an accumulation of one of the body humours that distended the joint and caused pain. Hippocrates also believed gout to be a result from sexual excess or too rich a diet as alluded to in three of his aphorisms ‚ÄúEunuchs do not take the gout nor become bald‚Äù, ‚ÄúA woman does not take the gout unless her menses has stopped‚Äù, and ‚ÄúA young man does not take the gout until he indulges coitus‚Äù. As with other diseases, physicians in antiquity believed that diet was the best way to manage gout. Hippocrates recommended high doses of white hellebore because he believed that the best and most natural relief for gout was dysentery. However, purging with white hellebore was probably for the more chronic cases due to the fact that wine and barleywater drinks were very strongly recommended. = Legumes in Ancient Greece = The importance of legumes in ancient Greek diet and medical practice is often disregarded. However, legumes improved the quality of the soil and were considered very important to the agriculturalists of the time. Additionally, legumes contain a high amount of albumen, which led them to be a critical dietary supplement in countries where meat was in short supply and difficult to store. Such was the case with Greece. People in the Graeco-Roman world consumed less meat than we do today and therefore, legumes were a necessary source of protein. Of all legumes, the lentil appears most frequently in Greek and Roman literature.The lentil plant Medicinally, Hippocrates recommends lentils as a remedy for ulcers and hemorrhoids. Bitter vetch, or Vicia ervilia, was also an important legume in ancient Greek medicine. The extensive medicinal qualities of the bitter vetch were thought reliable enough to later administer to Roman emperors such as Augustus. Bitter vetch was thought to heal pimples, prevent sores from spreading and soothe spots or sores when they appear on the breasts. It was also reported to relieve painful urination, flatulence, liver problems, and indigestion when roasted and mixed with honey and Hippocrates cautioned that when eaten boiled or raw, the consumption of bitter vetch may cause more flatulence or pain.  Food and Diet in Ancient Rome  = Humours, Anatomy and the Causes of Disease = The Eminent Galen of PergamumAt the heart of Roman Medicine and central to the development of Western Medicine is Galen of Pergamum (AD 129‚Äìc. AD 210). Galen was a prolific writer from whose surviving works comes what Galen believed to be the definitive guide to a healthy diet, based on the theory of the four humours. Galen understood the humoral theory in a dynamic sense rather than static sense such that yellow bile is hot and dry like fire; black bile is dry and cold like earth; phlegm is cold and moist like water; and blood is moist and hot. He also understood the humours to be produced by food through digestion and it is with digestion, and respiration, that Galen applies his knowledge of anatomy. According to Galen, digestion begins in the mouth because this where food comes into contact with the saliva. The chewed food is then pulled into the stomach where the heat of the stomach cooks the food into chyle. The chyle is then carried to the liver where the nutrients are converted to blood and transported throughout the body,. With this understanding of the humours as being dynamic, and his knowledge of anatomy, Galen was able to categorize illnesses as hot, cold, dry or moist and attribute the causes of these illnesses to specific types of foods. For example, in Galen's own ‚ÄúOn the Causes of Disease‚Äù, as cited by Mark Grant, Galen says when describing hot diseases that, ‚Äú[one cause of excessive heat] lies in foods that have hot and harsh powers, such as garlic, leeks, onions, and so on. Immoderate use of these foods sometimes sparks a fever,‚Äù. Galen believed that a good physician must also be a good cook. Therefore, in Galen's dietary treatise ‚ÄúOn the Powers of Foods‚Äù, recipes are often given in addition to descriptions of foods as being salty or sweet, sour or watery, difficult or easy to digest, costive or laxative, cooling or heating, etc. Galen insists that the balance of the four humours can be beneficially or adversely effected by ‚Äòdiet‚Äô which in Galenic medicine includes not just food and drink but also physical exercise, baths, massage, and climate = Food and the Treatment of Disease in Ancient Rome = As mentioned, certain types of food can affect the balance of the humours in different ways. According to Galen's ‚ÄúOn Humours,‚Äù as referenced by Wilkins et al., beef, camel, and goat meat, snails, cabbage, and soft cheeses produce black bile; brains, fungi, and hard apples cause phlegm; bitter almonds and garlic reduce phlegm. Additionally, for the treatment of gout, Galen suggested a range of dressings to be applied to the affected area made of mandrake, caper, and henbane and for the acute phase, creams made of seeds of conium, mushroom, and deer brain were administered.

A skilled engineer and inventor; he was instrumental in providing the Confederacy with much-needed gunpowder throughout the American Civil War. He also was the younger brother of fellow Confederate general Gabriel J. Rains. Biography Rains was born in Craven County in North Carolina in 1817. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1842 as third out of a class of 56; being commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers. In the next year he transferred to the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment and then became an assistant professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology back at West Point. He participated in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, fighting at Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey and Chapultepec. For his services he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and brevetted Captain. Over the next years he frequently changed stations and often served on recruiting duty. The full Captain's promotion came in February 1856 when he was stationed in New York but he resigned his commission half a year later.Cullum, pp. 40-41Eicher, p. 444Aztec Club Rains became a proprietor of the Washington & Highland Iron Works in Newburgh, New York and became a patent holding engineer for steam engines and boilers.Robbins He also married local Frances Josephine Ramsell (1838‚Äì1919) with whom he¬¥d have a daughter, Fanny Powell Rains. When the American Civil War began Rains joined the Confederate army. George Rains became a major in the Ordnance Department and was tasked to procure, and prospect for, gunpowder ingredients and to initiate the production. His work did much for the establishment of Gen. Isaac M. St. John's Bureau of Nitre and Mining, to which he transferred, in 1862. Being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he went to Augusta, Georgia and established the Confederate Powderworks at the Augusta Arsenal. Inspired by, and learning from, British material, his methods and inventions provided for comparably safe and efficient production. At its peak the powderworks regularly produced about a day, more than throughout the war, making it the second-largest gunpowder factory in the world at that time. Rains was promoted to colonel on July 12, 1863. Rains also commanded the local defense regiment and led it during Sherman's March to the Sea. Shortly before the war ended he additionally received command of the ordnance depots and arsenals in the lower Confederacy. Apparently in 1865 he had been made a brigadier general in the Georgia Militia, too, though he also kept his Confederate rank. His older brother Gabriel J. Rains was a West Point absolvent of 1827 and served as Confederate brigadier general as well. The older Rains had specialized in the creation and use of mines, booby traps and torpedoes; and headed the Torpedo Bureau.Eicher, p. 443 Though not working together the brothers were collectively known as Bomb Brothers while George Rains on his own had been called the Chief Chemist of the Confederacy.

A Marine pump is a pump which is used on board a vessel (ship) or an offshore platform. Upper category It is a kind of general equipment, usually driven by an electrical motor, refer to pump category. It is widely used as a machine in marine industry, refer to marine industry category. General A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action. A marine pump is an important auxiliary equipment in marine industry and ship building industry. It is widely used in all kinds of marine vessels, such as barges, tug boats, containers, carriers, ships, vessels, fixed offshore structure, drilling jack-up rigs and so on. These marine pumps can be serviced for cooling, circulating, ballast, general service(G/S), fire- fighting, boiler feed water, condensate water, fresh(drinking) water, sanitary water, bilge & sludge, F.O. transfer, L.O. transfer, F.O. and F.S. cargo pumping, cargo stripping, hydrophone tank unit, sewage treatment unit, oil water separator, incinerator, fresh water generator, and so on. Type Marine pump is named by its usage or application, it covers a lot of types of pumps, such as: The marine centrifugal pump is used to transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor. The fluid enters the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated by the impeller, flowing radially outward into a diffuser or volute chamber (casing), from where it exits. The gear pump is a marine gear pump that uses the meshing of gears to pump fluid by displacement. It is one of the most common types of pumps for hydraulic fluid power applications. Gear pumps are also widely used in chemical installations to pump high viscosity fluids. There are two main variations; external gear pumps which use two external spur gears, and internal gear pumps which use an external and an internal spur gears (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below). Gear pumps are positive displacement (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution. Some gear pumps are designed to function as either a motor or a pump. The screw pump is a positive- displacement (PD) pump that uses one or several screws to move fluids or solids along the screw(s) axis. In its simplest form (the Archimedes' screw pump), a single screw rotates in a cylindrical cavity, thereby moving the material along the screw's spindle.

The band initially played jazz fusion in the 1970s, which was popular at the time. At the beginning of the 1980s, they changed their style and became one of the most influential new wave bands in Czechoslovakia. Between the years 1983 and 1986, they were banned by the Communist regime, and it wasn't until the second half of the decade that they returned to performing and releasing new material. They disbanded in 2006 due to disagreements between the two band leaders, Koc√°b and Michal Pavl√≠ƒçek. Koc√°b started a new band, called Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr II, which performed until 2009. In 2012, the original Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr reunited. The band has released four studio albums since their inception in 1976. ≈Ω√≠ze≈à (1978), V√Ωbƒõr (1987), Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr (1988 - also known as Straka v hrsti), and Bƒõr (1997). Biography Singer and keyboard player Michael Koc√°b formed Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr in 1976 after leaving the jazz group Prague Big Band, and they played jazz fusion for the first few years. Their debut album, ≈Ω√≠ze≈à (Thirst), came out in 1978 and reflected the band's signature genre. They were joined towards the end of the 1970s by Michal Pavl√≠ƒçek, a classically-trained guitarist who was already known on the music scene as a proficient musician. Thanks to Pavl√≠ƒçek, Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr became influenced by new wave music and hard rock, and their subsequent compositions followed this style, with hints of punk added in. The band was rounded out by bass player Ond≈ôej Soukup and drummer Ji≈ô√≠ Tomek. In 1981, Soukup left Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr to join Karel Gott's backing band. He was replaced by Vil√©m ƒåok. Tomek also departed and Ji≈ô√≠ Hrube≈° took over on drums, stabilizing the band's lineup for a few years. In 1982, director Juraj Herz made the film Straka v hrsti (Magpie in the Hand) in collaboration with Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr, who provided the soundtrack. This inspired the band's second album, which they recorded that same year but didn't release until 1988, due to a prohibition which was placed upon them by the Czechoslovak government, effectively banning them from performing or releasing any material. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 1983 due to this ban, and drummer Hrube≈° emigrated. When the ban was lifted in 1986, the group reformed under the name V√Ωbƒõr. They released an eponymous album in 1987, followed by the shelved project Straka v hrsti, officially released under the title Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr, a year later. In 1992, the group staged a concert to celebrate the departure of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia. The performance was recorded and released the same year under the name Adieu C.A. The concert included a guest appearance by Frank Zappa. Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr's fourth album, Bƒõr, came out in 1997. The band was inducted into the Czech Rock Hall of Fame, known as Beatov√° s√≠≈à sl√°vy, in 2005, and a year later they split up due to internal divisions. Michael Koc√°b then launched his new project, titled Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr II, composed of bass player Richard Scheufler, vocalist Zlata Kinsk√°, drummer Klaudius Kry≈°p√≠n, and guitarist Glenn Proudfoot. The group performed in this lineup for three years, until 2009. In April 2012, the original Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr announced a reunion and played five concerts in the autumn of the same year. They went on tour with two drummers, Ji≈ô√≠ Hrube≈° and Klaudius Kry≈°p√≠n. In 2015, Michal Pavl√≠ƒçek won an Andƒõl Award for lifetime achievement. In December of the following year, Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr played their biggest concert ever, perfoming at Prague's O2 Arena. They were joined onstage by Ond≈ôej Soukup, Iva Pazderkov√°, and Vojtƒõch Dyk. On 4 July 2018, Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr opened for The Rolling Stones at Let≈àany airport in Prague.

These men were often members of a pipe band, that chose to enlist at the outbreak of World War I to assist with the Canadian war effort. Although most of the pipers were trained to fight, many of them played the bagpipes throughout the war as a way to encourage the troops as they walked into battle.  Overview of the Bagpipes in Canada  The use of bagpipes in wars is believed to have originated from the Battle of Culloden whereby Scottish Pipers would play war tunes while marching their troops into battle. Since the Highland Regiment never went to battle without a piper, the bagpipes in turn become known as both an instrument and a weapon of war.Williams, Ian S, \\"Piper James Reid: Culloden,\\" , The Pipes of War, 2011 The Great Highland Bagpipe, which is native to Scotland and was used in the Battle of Culloden, is the type of bagpipe that the Canadian pipe bands played during World War I.Allen, Greg Dawson, \\"Pipes and Pipers: Bagpipes in War,\\" The North Eastern Folklore Archive. After the defeat of Scotland in the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the British sought to destroy Scottish culture by placing a ban on everything in the Highlands, which included the bagpipes. As a result, many Scots immigrated to Canada bringing along their culture and traditions. During the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution, the English government employed Scottish pipers in the Highland Regiments to fight alongside the Canadian troops.Stewart, Tim, , \\"The Pipes Play On: Canadian Pipers at War, 1914‚Äì1918 An Inspired Tradition,\\" The Journal of Military History, Pg. 58.  History of Canadian Pipers in WWI  At the outbreak of World War I, many Scottish-Canadian's felt a sense of duty of enlist in the war. Various battalions such as, the 16th Battalion, the 13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF, the 15th Battalion (48th Highlanders of Canada), CEF, the 107th Battalion (Winnipeg), CEF, the 1st Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles, CEF, the 224th Battalion, CEF, the 208th Battalion (Canadian Irish), CEF, the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, and the Canadian Railway Troops, employed pipers from all across Canada, except Prince Edward Island, to fight in the war.Stewart, \\"The Pipes Play On,\\" Pg. 59. The purpose of having pipers play for the troops as they marched into battle was to encourage the troops to march on and face the enemy with courage. The sound of the bagpipes often lifted the spirit of the pipers fellow comrades and drowned out the sounds of the battle. The use of pipers in the First World War was often criticized due to the belief that the sound of the bagpipes would not be heard during the battles, and that the pipers were too vulnerable since they did not have a weapon to defend themselves with against the enemy fire. The commanding officer in several battalions would allow pipers to march to and from the front, but they did not allow them to play during the battles as there were too many piper casualties. The pipers who did play during the battles were faced with gas attacks and constant gunfire by enemy troops. For this reason, pipers were assigned other duties such as, stretcher-bearers and supply runners.Stewart, \\"The Pipes Play On,\\" Pg. 61‚Äì62.  The Canadian Pipers and the 16th Battalion  Canadian Regiments in World War I often had a pipe band also known as Canadian military bands. The most well known Canadian pipe band during World War I played alongside the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF. The 16th Battalion was formed in September 1914, shortly after Canada entered the First World War. After the enlistment process began, the 16th Battalion called for an entire pipe band to escort them in the war. After arriving on the front, and throughout the war, the 16th Battalion rarely fought without the Canadian pipers.Corporal D.M. Drysdale, \\"Pipe Band of the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish) C.E.F.\\" Pipes of War. Pg. 1. During the war, many of the 16th Battalion pipers served as runners who brought orders, rations, and ammunition to the front, while others acted as stretcher-bearers responsible for bringing wounded troops to the rear. Although some pipers were permitted to play during the battles, most would play while the troops marched to the front, and during the ceremonies that were held between battles.Drysdale, \\"Pipe Band of the 16th Battalion,\\" Pg. 3. For the first part of the war, the tune \\"Scotland is my ain Hame\\" was used during the marches, which was later was changed to \\"All the Blue Bonnets are O'er the Border.\\" In total, the 16th Battalion had thirty pipers enlist during the First World War.Drysdale, \\"Pipe Band of the 16th Battalion,\\" Pg. 8.  Canadian Pipers in The Battles of WWI  Canada's most famous piper during World War I was James Cleland Richardson; however, other pipers also risked their lives to play alongside the Canadian troops during the war. During the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915, pipers James Thomson and William McIvor of the 16th Battalion died of wounds they received following a German gas attack. A month later, pipers George Birnie and Augus Morrison of the 16th Battalion died from enemy fire.Stewart, \\"The Pipes Play On,\\" Pg. 59. In 1917, piper John Park of the 16th Battalion was killed. In August 1918, piper George Paul, who later received a Military Medal was killed while playing the bagpipes atop a tank in Ameins.Stewart, \\"The Pipes Play On,\\" Pg. 60. Piper Alec McGillivray of the 16th Battalion, who also received a Military Medal, was killed by a shell burst. In September 1918, Pipe Major James Groat was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for playing his colonel (Cyrus Peck VC) into action.Stewart, \\"The Pipes Play On,\\" Pg. 61. Pipers Walter Teller and W. Brand of the 25th Battalion (Nova Scotia Rifles), CEF were both awarded Military Medals for playing the bagpipes during the Battle of Vimy Ridge. Other pipers were awarded medals for their bravery during the war including Corporal William Curries and piper Hugh Mackenzie of the 21st Battalion. Each battalion suffered piper casualties, with the total number of casualties of pipers during the war is estimated to be over one thousand, five-hundred of which were fatal.Stewart, \\"The Pipes Play On,\\" Pg. 63.  Canadian Piper James Cleland Richardson  Canada's famous piper James Cleland Richardson and his family immigrated to Canada from Scotland in 1913, and when war broke out in 1914, James enlisted as a piper with the 16th Battalion. Richardson was involved in the Capture of Regina Trench, during the Battle of Somme, where he volunteered to pipe his troops through the battle.Forsythe, Mark, and Greg Dickson, From the West Coast to the Western Front: British Columbians and the Great War, British Columbia: Harbour Publishing Company Limited, 2014. During the attack, Richardson was ordered to take care of a wounded comrade and some prisoners, forcing him to leave behind his bagpipes. Upon returning to retrieve the bagpipes, Richardson was killed. On October 22, 1918, James Richardson became the only Canadian piper to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery and action at Regina Trench.Reginald H. Roy, , \\"RICHARDSON, JAMES CLELAND,\\" Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Vol. 14, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003.

Career Educated at Rugby School, he joined the 2nd Battalion of the 30th Regiment of Foot, as a volunteer, in 1814, at the age of 16. Macready later served under Lord Lynedoch in Holland. At the Battle of Waterloo, when still only an ensign, he commanded the light company towards the close of the battle. At the end of the battle he was the only surviving officer, along with 16 men, of the original three officers and 51 men. For his gallantry he was promoted to lieutenant on 20July 1815 and remained with the Army of Occupation at the end of the Waterloo Campaign. In one of his private journals Macready tells of his experiences at Waterloo. He is quoted from in Henry Havelick's Three Main Military Questions of the Day published in 1867, in order to show repeated cavalry failures in their attempts to break through infantry squares well provided with ammunition in addition to bayonets. \\"Here come these fools again,\\" Macready remarks at the repeated charges of the French curassiers in the face of significant firepower from the infantry square. He was at the siege of Asseerghur in Central India during the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817‚Äì1818), and afterwards became military secretary to Sir John Wilson, the governor of Ceylon. He was subsequently aide-de-camp to Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, James Mackenzie. Macready was promoted from captain to major by purchase on half pay and unattached on 22November 1839. He died at Clevedon on 4November 1848 and is buried in St. Peter's Churchyard, Leckhampton, Gloucestershire. Works Macready wrote a posthumously published biography of the Russian general Alexander Suvorov. * He was a prolific keeper of journals, a number of which are in the collection of the National Army Museum. Extracts from his journals from his time in India were also published in Henry Colburn's United Service Magazine and Naval and Military Gazette during the 1850s. Family life In 1840 he married Martha Sarah Rolls, who in 1839 had published a series of etchings of Macready's thespian brother. She died on 7August 1886 and in her will bequeathed ¬£100 to the senior officer other than the colonel-in-chief of the 30th Regiment of Foot for the benefit of the wives, widows and children.

The episode premiered on Comedy Central on October 28, 2015. The episode parodies the slash fiction genre of yaoi art and the acceptance of the LGBT community, while continuing its season-long lampoon of political correctness. Plot PC Principal and Wendy host an assembly to introduce students to the Asian art of yaoi, which has increased due to the influx of Asian students. The pictures shown are all manga-style drawings of Tweek and Craig engaged in homoerotic and homosexual activity, and the gang is confused at this. Tweek and Craig are brought in to Principal's office where they both assert that they are not gay, but Principal tells them that if there is a relationship between them, they must have affirmative consent. Stan talks with his father Randy about his confusion over who \\"the Asians\\" arbitrarily decide to portray as gay in yaoi. Randy, who knows nothing about the topic but is desperate to appear politically correct, comes to the conclusion that Asians are allowed to decide who is actually gay or not. Meanwhile, Randy is thrilled at the appearance/coming out of the closet of the \\"gay couple\\", citing the Whole Foods Market in town as part of the reason. At Whole Foods, Craig's father Thomas is congratulated for Craig being gay, but he is unwilling to accept this. At Tweek's home, Tweek's parents celebrate and accept his gay status by rewarding him with money. As Cartman ponders the relationship of Tweek and Craig, he starts fantasizing again about his Cupid-like alter ego Cupid Me (last seen in \\"Cartman Finds Love\\"). Cupid Me visits Craig in his sleep and shoots him with a love arrow to help with their relationship. Cupid Me then begins to express his homosexual feelings for Cartman, who rejects him. The next day at school, the growing tension between Tweek and Craig leads to them fighting, but it is dismissed as a lovers' quarrel, and they are given money and dismissed without punishment. When Randy calls Chinese President Xi Jinping to ask for clarifications about yaoi, the Chinese President angrily replies that the Japanese, not Chinese, do this and begins ranting about the rape of Nanking. As Thomas turns to alcohol, Randy tells him that he has no control of whether or not Craig is gay: it is the Japanese who make those decisions and they even got away with \\"raping Don King\\". Craig convinces Tweek to announce that they are gay and then stage a fake breakup in order to put the matter to rest. Initially reluctant, Tweek gets carried away with the performance, portraying himself as the wronged party. Craig becomes massively unpopular, with yaoi artists getting even more inspired by Tweek's heartbreak. Cartman meets Cupid Me at a gay bar to ask him for help, and Cupid Me agrees but insists on having a date with Cartman as payment. Tweek apologizes to Craig for making him appear to be manipulative but Craig rejects his idea to pretend to get back together. Thomas becomes willing to accept his son thanks to a love arrow shot by Cupid Me, and encourages Craig to be gay and gives him money. Tweek and Craig reunite and begin holding hands together in public and playing games together, bringing joy back to the town. Meanwhile, Cartman has his date with Cupid Me, which involves a massage in his bed. As Cupid Me attempts to molest Cartman, Cartman is revealed to be alone in his bathroom masturbating.  Production  Prior to the airing of the episode, producers solicited viewers to submit yaoi-style fan art drawings of Tweek and Craig, which were incorporated into the episode.  In other media  There is a side-mission for collecting yaoi art of Tweek and Craig for Craig's dad in the video game South Park: The Fractured But Whole. Reception IGN's Max Nicholson gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10, and commented in his review that the yaoi theme \\"resulted in one of the funniest episodes of South Park for [him] in recent memory ‚Äì definitely this season\\". Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 3 out of 5 stars and stated that \\"Slowly turning the town of South Park into a liberal bastion of modern Millennial and social media values has opened a whole new side of not just the town folks, but of Matt and Trey's humor. Yeah, the [South Park] residents are still bigoted shit-kickers, but now their hearts are in the right place.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Dan Caffrey noted that he did not know of the actual existence of Tweek and Craig yaoi art, while giving the episode an A‚àí rating and commenting: \\"if anything, 'Tweek x Craig' is critical not of homophobia, but of something much more general, something that's become the target of many, many South Park episodes since the show first aired: following a trend without doing the research\\". Series co-creator Matt Stone received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance for this episode.

His experiences were recorded by his son Thomas Grey in his chronicles, and provide a rare picture of the day to day realities of the Wars. His career, blemished by his suicidal charge at the Battle of Bannockburn, a contributing factor to the devastating English defeat, is perhaps best known for his role in the tale of Sir William Marmion the chivalric knight of Norham Castle. Career and Life =Early life= Grey was serving under William de Hesilrig, Sheriff of Clydesdale as early as 1297. Following William Wallace's nighttime assassination of the Sheriff at Lanark, Grey was left for dead, stripped naked in the snow. He only survived because of the heat from the houses burning around him and was rescued the next day and his wounds healed. Grey was knighted before September 1301 and served with the king's lieutenant for Scotland, Patrick IV, Earl of March at Ayr. In May 1303 Grey found himself under the command of Hugh Audley encamped at Melrose Abbey when they were attacked at night by a much larger force led by John Comyn. Grey was beaten to the floor and taken prisoner but most of his comrades were slain. =Siege of Stirling Castle (1304)= Springald Edward I had captured most of Scotland by April 1304 and embarked upon a nineteen-week siege of the last significant uncaptured fortress at Stirling Castle using twelve siege engines which included the massive trebuchet called \\"Warwolf\\". Grey fought at the siege under the command of Henry de Beaumont. A hook thrown from a siege machine ensnared de Beaumont one day, and was about to haul him to his death upon the castle walls, when Grey freed him in the nick of time and dragged him to safety. Just as Grey had performed this act of bravery he was struck in the head by a large bolt fired from a springald (a large multi- man crossbow) just below his eyes. He collapsed to the ground lifeless and preparations for a quick burial were made. Just as the funeral ceremony started, Grey suddenly stirred and opened his eyes, much to the astonishment of the funeral party. He subsequently staged a full recovery. It is from this event that Grey perhaps adopted a ram's head as the crest of his coat of arms as a light-hearted reference to his thick skull. Grey became closer to the Beaumont family, who were kinsmen of both the king and queen, and was drawn into court life. In 1305 Grey acted as attorney for de Beaumont's sister Isabella de Vesci. In December 1307 Grey took custody of Robert Bruce's sister Christina following the execution of her husband Christopher Seton for his part in the murder of John Comyn, Guardian of Scotland. =Ambush at Cupar Castle (1308)= Upon the death of Edward I he was succeeded by his son Edward II and Grey attended the coronation at Westminster Palace in February 1308. As Grey returned to Cupar Castle, of which he was the then warden, he was ambushed by Walter de Bickerton, a supporter of Bruce. Grey was heavily outnumbered, having only 26 man-at-arms compared to the 400 men commanded by Bickerton. Deciding that he could not avoid the ambush he decided to charge the heart of Bickerton's men using lance and the shock of his horse to down many of the enemy. Seeing the success of his aggression he was joined by his men at arms and together they succeeded in overthrowing many of the enemy and stampeded their horses. Before starting the charge, Grey had instructed his grooms to follow at a distance carrying a battle standard. As they came into view of Bickerton's confused men they mistook the grooms for another formation of soldiers and took flight. Grey and his men drove one hundred and eighty of Bickerton's abandoned horses to his castle as booty. =Battle of Bannockburn (1314)= Grey's capture at the Battle of Bannockburn was undoubtedly the low point of his career. Grey served under Beaumont and Robert Clifford when they tried to go around the Scottish army on the first day of the battle and met with defeat at the hands of the forces of Sir Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray. On the second day of the battle, the English were heavily defeated and the king fled the field with a force of some 500 knights and was pursued by Sir James Douglas with only a small force, leaving hundreds of English dead on the field and a large number of English nobles and knights taken prisoner. =Norham Castle= The ruins of the keep of Norham Castle. Following their victory at Bannockburn, the Scottish attacked and raided the north of England repeatedly over the ensuing years. Grey was garrisoned at Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1318 which fell to Bruce following an eleven-week siege. Grey was subsequently recompensed ¬£179 arrears of wages for himself and 14 man-at-arms and for horses he had lost. In 1317 Grey's patron de Beaumont and his brother Louis de Beaumont, soon to be installed as Bishop of Durham, were kidnapped by Guy de Middleton before being freed by William de Felton. Middleton was executed and his lands confiscated. In May 1319, as reward for his services, Grey was granted 108 acres at Howick, Northumberland that formerly belonged to a supporter of Middleton, John Mautulent. Grey was appointed in 1319 as Sheriff of Norham and Islandshire and Constable of Norham Castle where he was to be based for 11 years. During this time Norham remained under a state of almost perpetual siege and it is Grey's rescue of William Marmion that he is probably best known for. A two year truce expired in 1322 and Grey promised the king to recruit an extra 20 men at arms and 50 hobelars to reinforce Lewis de Beaumont's existing garrison to protect both Norham castle and the March. By 17 September Norham found itself besieged by 100 Scottish men at arms and 100 hobelars. The king sent Grey money to pay his garrison and requested that he send frequent reports of the situation and reassured the people around the castle that any losses in crops and goods would be made up to them. Edward II agreed to a 13 year truce with Bruce in May 1323 and, three months later, Grey was given permission to go to Scotland to resupply Norham Castle with corn and ammunition and to replace its ploughs and carts which had been destroyed in the preceding years. He imprisoned 80 Scots at Norham who had, coming from overseas, landed at Lindisfarne and attempted to reach Scotland and on 2 October was ordered to send them to the Sheriff of York at York Castle. On 9 July 1325 Grey was ordered to accept back into the king's peace all those of Northumberland who had joined the Scottish through poverty or other urgent needs. =Later career= During the buildup to the impending Invasion of England of 1326 Grey was first granted more land at Howyk and then in August ordered to join John de Sturmy, Admiral of the Fleet of the North, alongside other captains and their ships, to help defend the hugely unpopular Edward II from his wife Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. Grey was ordered to \\"compel\\" ships from Northumberland ports to join the fleet and to supervise their departure for Orwell, Suffolk in early September. No naval conflict occurred and, landing at Orwell on 24 September, Isabella and Mortimer seized control of England with virtually no opposition, with most of Edward's orders having been ignored. Edward II was imprisoned and replaced on the throne by Edward III. Edward III resumed hostilities with the Scottish and, shortly after the defeat of the Scottish at Halidon Hill in July 1333, Grey was appointed as deputy constable of Berwick. In about 1334 Grey was granted Mitford Castle and the hamlet of Mollisdoun and in October 1335 he was granted custody of the lands and marriage of the heir of Andrew de Grey in Berwick. Family and descendants Grey married Agnes de Bayles and had the following issue: * Sir Thomas Grey, Soldier and Chronicler Thomas is an ancestor of the Earl Greys of Tankerville, Baronet Grey of Chillingham, Baron Greys of Powis and Baron Greys of Werke.

In 2015, she qualified for the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, selected for the T37 100m and 200m. She took the gold in the 400m sprint, setting a new world record. Personal history Hermitage was born in Guildford, England in 1989. She has cerebral palsy which mainly affects the left side of her body. She was educated at George Abbot School in her home town. In 2012 Hermitage gave birth to her first child. Sporting career Hermitage took up athletics as a school girl and joined Guildford & Godalming Athletics Club. At the age of 14, frustrated by her lack of progress compared to her peers, she was approached by coach Hazel Childs who suggested she switch to parasports. Hermitage took the advice badly and quit athletics in protest, though she later admitted regretting this decision. In 2012, following the London Paralympics and inspired to leave a legacy to her new born daughter, Hermitage decided to become classified as a parasport athlete. She was classified as a T37 competitor and in 2013 she entered her first meets as a disability runner. She intended to compete throughout 2014, but a stress fracture to her foot saw her miss the majority of that year's competition including the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea. In February 2015 Hermitage made her international debut when she travelled to Dubai to take part in the Fazaa International, the first IPC Grand Prix of the year. At the meet she ran 14.22 to set a new personal best in the 100m sprint, winning gold in the process. In June that year Hermitage represented Great Britain again when she competed at the Berlin IPC Grand Prix. There she entered the 100m, 200m and 400m sprints. She won all three events, posting personal bests in the 100m (13.80s) and 200m (28.48s) and beating Lisa McIntosh's 15-year-old record in the T37 400m sprint with a time of 1:02.70.

A year after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972 because of NPA (New People's Army) rebellion against the government, he announced the decision to build a nuclear power plant at Bataan. This was in response to the 1973 oil crisis, as the Middle East oil embargo had put a heavy strain on the Philippine economy, and Marcos know that nuclear power is the solution to meeting the country's energy demands and decreasing dependence on imported oil.ABS-CBN News.

Mt. Pinatubo, which erupted in 1991. In 2016, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defence secretary under the Marcos administration, claimed that the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was intended to be used in a development of a nuclear weapons program. While he maintained that the facility's main purpose was for electricity generation he alleged that the nuclear power plant's second purpose is for nuclear weapons production. Enrile speculated that if the Philippines had successfully developed nuclear weapons, China would be deterred in pursuing aggressive claims in the South China Sea. However he admitted that he was not aware on the mechanics and technology in the production of nuclear weapons himself. During the Cold War, specifically at the time of Ferdinand Marcos from 1965 to 1986, American nuclear warheads were secretly stockpiled in the country. The Filipino public never knew of it until much later after the regime, and only Marcos knew of it as he was secretly informed by American military advisers as early as 1966. Currently, however, there was a movement in the country that aims to stop construction of nuclear power plants in the country and terminate American military presence in the country, which were believed to house nuclear weapons on Philippine soil. Despite provocations by China since 2010s amidst the South China Sea disputes, President Benigno Simeon Aquino III disagreed on letting the Philippines have nuclear weapons.Aquino thumbs down nuclear weapons for AFP He justified it from the lack of government funds to create such weapon, coupled with the fact that having such weapon would only escalate tensions between the two countries. In 2019, Juan Ponce Enrile reiterates his earlier claims in 2016 that the Philippines should have developed nuclear weapons to assert its claims, particularly in reinforcing the Philippines v. China international arbitration ruling, regarding its territorial disputes with China.http://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2019/4/15/Juan-Ponce-Enrile-nuclear- weapons.html Defense secretary Delfin Lorenzana in response to Enrile's statement said that the Philippines is not planning to develop nuclear weapons due to the country's limited technological capabilities as well as legal obligations such as being party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

He was the chief ing√©nieur des ponts et chauss√©es for the States of Burgundy ().  Biography  In 1706, the (\\"States of Burgundy\\") had decided to appoint a chief Ing√©nieur des ponts et chauss√©es (literally \\"Engineer of Bridges and [High]ways\\", more naturally in Modern English \\"Civil Engineer\\") for the province. The first was a Mr. Jerson, who was replaced in November 1710 by a Mr. Morin, an architect. He held the post until 1736, when the States replaced him with a Mr. Bonnichon. When Bonnichon fell ill, Dumorey was appointed as his assistant. Dumorey became the Chief Engineer himself in 1750. In 1735, he drew up plans for the town hall at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, which was completed in 1742. In 1752, the States of Burgundy decided to create two assistant chief posts. Dumorey became the chief engineer of . In March 1752, \\"commissioning\\" was given over to Joseph Pierre Antoine, an alumnus of the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es, and to Charles Joseph Le Jolivet, a student. In 1758 a third assistant post was created and awarded to √âmiland Marie Gauthey.Who replaced Dumorey on his death. He was the architect of the Ch√¢teau d'Arcelot from 1761 to 1764. In 1762 he worked on a plan for the provision of water to the public water fountains in Dijon, as a contractor for Dufour, the superintendent of Villeneuve-sous-Charigny. In 1768 he built a water fountain in Marjonzin, near the hamlet of √âtroyes, where he owned land. This project perhaps replaced another, one to build a pump to supply the city of Chalon from the River Sa√¥ne. That project was abandoned.In 1988, some citizens suggested moving the fountain from the middle of the field in which it had lain abandoned to the entrance to the commune. Since 1751, ideas had been floated by the √âtats de Bourgogne to study the improvement of the ports and quays along the River Sa√¥ne. Dumorey submitted simplified plans in 1762, but not much happened. In 1770, superintendent Amelot asked the Mayor of Chalon, Claude Perrault, for a feasibility study with Gauthey and the town's tradesmen to ensure the project was workable. On 5 January 1771 the superindentant signed an order that Dumorey could continue the project \\"in the presence of interested parties\\" to give detailed estimates for the projected works. The decision was finalised in 1774, and in 1775, Dumorey took over responsibility for the project, with Gauthey. In 1777, Dumorey signed a contract for the . Work was completed in 1780 under Gauthey. Between 1772 and 1778, with Gauthey, he planned the enlargement and rebuilding of the electoral chamber oaround the (\\"Floral Court\\") of the Palace of the States of Dijon. At this time, Dumorey was the States' chief architect. In 1776, together with Gauthey, he designed the at Givry (Sa√¥ne-et-Loire). He made studies for the (\\"Joly Bridge\\") at Semur-en-Auxois. The foundation stone was laid on 12 September 1779, and construction lasted until 1786. In 1780, Dumorey drew up plans for the barque bridge at Louhans. With Gauthey, Dumorey drew up plans for the (\\"Stone Bridge\\") over the Baulch stream on the road from Mon√©teau to Auxerre (both in the Yonne department in Burgundy). This was built between 1781 and 1786.

Between 1945 and 1956, especially after the Government of India announced plans to reorganize states along linguistic lines, the people of Tamil-majority Kanyakumari campaigned for its inclusion in the Madras State (later Tamil Nadu) instead of the Malayalam-majority Kerala state. In Tamil, the campaign is also known as Therkku Ellai Porattam (\\"South Frontier Struggle\\"). The campaign was successful: Agastheeswaram, Kalkulam, Thovalai, Vilavancode and half part of Shenkottai taluks were merged with Madras as per the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The first four were combined to form the present-day Kanyakumari district, while Shenkottai was merged with the Tirunelveli district.  Background  Tamils lived in large numbers in the Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, sengottai taluks of erstwhile Tranvancore State. In the Tamil regions, Malayalam was the official language and there were only a few Tamil-medium schools. So the Tamils met many hardships. Travancore State Government continued rejecting the requests of Tamils.V. S. Sathianesan - Tamil Separatism in Travancore During that period the Travancore State Congress favoured the idea of uniting all the Malayalam speaking regions and the formation of a \\"Unified Kerala\\". In protest against this idea, many Tamil leaders vacated the party. Although 80% of the place where malayalam speakers ,a few tamil peoples argue for making kanyakumari with Madras Presidency .They gathered together at Nagercoil on 16 December 1945 under the leadership of Sam Nathaniel and formed the new political party All Travancore Tamilian Congress. That party was continuously compelling for the merger of Tamil regions in Travancore with Tamil Nadu.R. Isaac Jeyadhas - Kanyakumari District and Indian Independence Struggle (Tamil)  Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress (T.T.N.C)  In the working committee meeting of Tamilian congress at Eraviputhur on 30 June 1946, the name of the political party was changed to Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress (T.T.N.C). T.T.N.C was popular among the Tamils living in Thovalai and Agateeswaram Taluks. Mr. Ma. Po. Sivagnanam (Ma.Po.Si) was the only leader from Tamil Nadu who functioned in favour of T.T.N.C.D. Daniel - Travancore Tamils: Struggle for Identity. After the independence of India, State Assembly Elections were announced in Travancore. As a consequence, T.T.N.C improved its popularity among Tamils. A popular and leading advocate from Vilavancode Mr. A. Nesamony organised a meeting of his supporters at Allan Memorial Hall, Nagercoil on 8 September 1947. In that meeting it was declared that they must achieve their objective through their political organisation, the T.T.N.C. And T.T.N.C started gaining strength and momentum in Kalkulam - Vilavancode Taluks.B. Yogeeswaran - History of Travancore Tamil Struggle (Tamil)  1948 police firing  During the election propaganda campaign, clashes occurred between the Tamil Nadar community and the Malayali Nair community at various places in Kalkulam - Vilavancode Taluks. police force suppressed the agitating Nadars. On February 1948 police opened fire and two Tamil speaking Nadars were killed. T.T.N.C won in 14 constituencies in the election to the State Legislative Assembly. Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as the legislative leader of the party. Then under his leadership, the awakened Tamil population was prepared to undergo any sacrifice to achieve their goal.D. Peter - Malayali Dominance and Tamil Liberation (Tamil)  1952 general elections  In 1950, a meeting was held at Palayamkottai to make compromises between state congress and T.T.N.C. The meeting met with failure and Mr. Sam Nathaniel resigned from the post of president of T.T.N.C Mr. P. Ramasamy Pillai, a strong follower of Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as the New President. The first general election of Independent India was held on 1952. T.T.N.C won 8 legislative assembly seats. Mr. A. Chidambaranathan became the minister on behalf of T.T.N.C in the coalition state government formed by the Congress. In the parliamentary Constituency Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as M.P. and in the Rajyasabha seat. Mr. A. Abdul Razak was elected as M.P. on behalf of T.T.N.C. In due course, accusing the Congress government for not showing enough care the struggle of the Tamils, T.T.N.C had broken away from the coalition and the Congress government lost the majority. So fresh elections were announced. In 1954 elections, T.T.N.C gained victory in 12 constituencies.  1954 police firing  Pattom Thanu Pillai was the chief minister for Thiru - Kochi legislative assembly. He engaged hard measures against the agitations of Tamils. Especially the Tamils at Devikulam - Peermedu regions went through the atrocities of Travancore Police force. Condemning the attitude of the police, T.T.N.C leaders from Nagercoil went to Munnar and participated in agitations against the prohibitive orders. The leaders were arrested and an uncalm atmosphere prevailed in South Travancore.R. Kuppusamy - Historical foot prints of a True War (Tamil) On 11 August, Liberation Day celebrations were held at many places in South Travancore. Public meetings and processions were organised . Communists also collaborated with the agitation programmes. Police opened fire at the processions in Thoduvetty (Martandam) and Puthukadai. Nine Tamil volunteers were killed and thousands of T.T.N.C and communist sympathizers were arrested in various parts of Tamil main land. At the end, Pattom Thanu Pillai's ministry was toppled and normalcy returned to the Tamil regions.  States Reorganization Commission  The central government had appointed Fazal Ali Commission(1953 dec) for the states reorganisation based on language. It submitted its report on 10 August 1955. Based on this report, Devikulam - Peermedu and Neyyattinkara Taluks were merged with Kerala state.B. Mariya John - Linguistic Reorganisation of Madras Presidenty On 1 November 1956 - four Taluks Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, Kalkulam, Vilavancode were recognised to form the New Kanyakumari District and merged with Tamil Nadu State. Half of Sengottai Taluk was merged with Tirunelveli District. The main demand of T.T.N.C was to merger the Tamil regions with Tamil Nadu and major part of its demand was realised. So T.T.N.C was dissolved thereafter.

Initially launched as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel, Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the internet and specialty television channels in multiple languages. Al Jazeera Media Network is a global news organization with 80 bureaus around the world. The original Al Jazeera Arabic channel's willingness to broadcast dissenting views, for example on call-in shows, created controversies in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. One of the station's office was the only channel to cover the War in Afghanistan live. Al Jazeera Media Network is a news channel for public benefit under Qatari law. Under this structure, the channel receives funding from the government of Qatar but maintains its editorial independence. Critics have accused Al Jazeera of supporting the positions of the Qatari government, though Al Jazeera platforms and channels have published content that has been critical of Qatar or has run counter to Qatari laws and norms. The network is sometimes perceived to have mainly Islamist perspectives, promoting the Muslim Brotherhood, and having a pro-Sunni and an anti-Shia bias in its reporting of regional issues. Al Jazeera insists it covers all sides of a debate; for instance, the network says it presents Israel's views and Iran's views with equal objectivity. Al Jazeera has aired videos released by Osama bin Laden. In June 2017, the Saudi, Emirati, Bahraini, and Egyptian governments demanded the closure of the news station as one of thirteen demands made to Qatar during the 2017 Qatar crisis. Other media networks have spoken out in support of the network. According to The Atlantic magazine, Al Jazeera presents a far more moderate, Westernized face than Islamic jihadism or rigid Sunni orthodoxy and though the network has been criticized as \\"an 'Islamist' stalking horse,\\" it actually features \\"very little specifically religious content in its broadcasts.\\" Etymology In Arabic, ' literally means \\"the island\\". However, it refers here to the Arabian Peninsula, which is , abbreviated to . (Compare the Arabic name () for Upper Mesopotamia, another area of land almost entirely surrounded by water.) Also Algeciras. History =Launch= Al Jazeera Satellite Channel, now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the BBC's Arabic language television station, a joint venture with Orbit Communications Company. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views. The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, provided a loan of QAR 500 million (US$137 million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West. Shares were held by private investors as well as the Qatar government. Al Jazeera Arabic Building Al Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001. At the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch, Arabsat was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak C-band transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful Ku-band transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, Canal France International, accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia. Al Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of Operation Desert Storm on CNN International underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world. In presenting \\"The opinion and the other opinion\\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking Hebrew on Arab television for the first time. Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called The Opposite Direction, were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect. Al Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the Operation Desert Fox bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by Western media. =Around the clock= 1 January 1999, was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting. Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25 million at the time. However controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored Middle East Broadcasting Centre (MBC) and London's Arab News Network (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via British Sky Broadcasting. =War in Afghanistan= Al Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists. Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the Unabomber's messages in The New York Times. The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience. Many other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage. CNN International had exclusive rights to it for six hours before other networks could broadcast, a provision that was broken by the others on at least one controversial occasion. Prime Minister Tony Blair soon appeared on an Al Jazeera talk show on 14 November 2001, to state Britain's case for pursuing the Taliban into Afghanistan. Al Jazeera's prominence rose during the war in Afghanistan because it had opened a bureau in Kabul before the war began. This gave it better access for videotaping events than other networks, which bought Al Jazeera's footage, sometimes for as much as $250,000.Mohammed El-Nawawy, 2003. Al-jazeera: The Story of the Network That Is Rattling Governments and Redefining Modern Journalism. Cambridge, MA: Westview Press, p. 166, The Kabul office was destroyed by United States bombs in 2001. Looking to stay ahead of possible future conflicts, Al Jazeera then opened bureaux in other troubled spots. The network remained dependent on government support in 2002, with a budget of $40 million and ad revenues of about $8 million. It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, Al Arabiya, an offshoot of the Middle East Broadcasting Center, which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing. On 21 May 2003, Al Jazeera broadcast a three-minute clip from a tape that was obtained from Al Qaeda. The tape about Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian physician and the intellectual supporter of Al Qaeda. In the tape, Zawahiri mentioned the 11 September attack and more terrorism against the Western countries saying that \\"The Crusaders and Jews understand only the language of killing and blood. They can only be persuaded through returning coffins, devastated interests, burning towers and collapsed economies.\\" In September 2003, Tayseer Allouni, the Al Jazeera journalist who handled to interview Osama bin Ladin several weeks later the 11 September attack was arrested by Spanish government agency. Allouni was accused of being close to Al Qaeda, eventually was found guilty, and sentenced to seven years of house arrest. In October 2003, the managing editor of the Saudi newspaper Arab News, John R. Bradley accounted that the Bush administration had told the Qatari government that \\"If Al Jazeera failed to reconsider its news context, the US would, in turn, have to consider its relation with Qatar.\\" =2003 Iraq War= Before and during the United States- led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences. Al Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel. An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told The New York Times. There were 23 bureaux around the world and 70 foreign correspondents, with 450 journalists in all. On 1 April 2003, a United States plane fired on Al Jazeera's Baghdad bureau, killing reporter Tareq Ayyoub. The attack was called a mistake; however, Qatar had supplied the US with a precise map of the location of the bureau in order to spare it from attack.Robert Fisk: The Independent, 2 November 2011. Retrieved 5 November 2011 Afshin Rattansi became the channel's first English-language broadcast journalist after he left the BBC Today Programme, after the death of UK government scientist David Kelly. =2017 Qatar blockade= The closing of the Al Jazeera Media Network was one of the terms of diplomatic reestablishment put forward by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis. On 23 June 2017, the countries that cut ties to Qatar issued a list of demands to end the crisis, insisting that Qatar shut down the Al Jazeera network, close a Turkish military base and scale down ties with Iran. The call, included in a list of 13 points, read: \\"Shut down Al Jazeera and its affiliate stations.\\" Agencies, media outlets, journalists and media rights organisations have decried the demands to close Al Jazeera as attempts to curb press freedom, including Reporters Without Borders; CPJ; IFEX; The Guardian and The New York Times. Earlier, Saudi Arabia and the UAE blocked Al Jazeera websites; Saudi Arabia closed Al Jazeera's bureau in Riyadh and halted its operating licence, accusing the network of promoting \\"terrorist groups\\" in the region; and Jordan also revoked the licence for Al Jazeera. Saudi Arabia also banned hotels from airing Al Jazeera, threatening fines of up to $26,000 for those violating the ban. On 6 June 2017, Al Jazeera was the victim of a cyber attack on all of its platforms. Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, has said Doha will not discuss the status of Al Jazeera in any negotiations. \\"Doha rejects discussing any matter related to Al Jazeera channel as it considers it an internal affair,\\" Qatar News Agency quoted the foreign minister as saying. \\"Decisions concerning the Qatari internal affairs are Qatari sovereignty - and no one has to interfere with them.\\" In June 2017, hacked emails from Yousef Al Otaiba (UAE ambassador to US) were reported as \\"embarrassing\\" by Al Jazeera because they showed links between the UAE and the US-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. UAE news outlets claimed that the extensive media coverage of the email hack was a provocation and that the hacking was a move orchestrated by Qatar. On 24 November 2017, Dubai Police deputy chief Lieutenant General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim accused Al Jazeera of provoking the 2017 Sinai attack and called for bombing of Al Jazeera by the Saudi-led coalition, tweeting in Arabic \\"The alliance must bomb the machine of terrorism ... the channel of ISIL, al-Qaeda and the al-Nusra front, Al Jazeera the terrorists\\". In 2018, Al Jazeera reported apparent new details regarding a 1996 Qatari coup d'√©tat attempt accusing the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt, of plotting to overthrow Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. According to Al Jazeera, a former French army commander Paul Barril was contracted and supplied with weapons by the UAE to carry out the coup operation in Qatar. UAE minister of foreign affairs Anwar Gargash responded to the documentary and stated that Paul Barril was in fact a security agent of the Qatari Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani who visited Abu Dhabi and had no relationship with the UAE and the documentary was a falsification attempt through a pay-rolled speaker to inculpate the UAE in the coup. =United Arab Emirates lobbying= As of June 2019, the United Arab Emirates had paid the lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld $1.9m in the preceding year, principally concerning Qatar government-owned media. Lobbyists met with the FCC nine times and with 30 members of the House and Senate during the same time period. A spokesman for the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley, said that the committee had been \\"reviewing Al Jazeera's activities\\" prior to the UAE's lobbying effort. During this time the firm lobbied for Al Jazeera to be reclassified as a foreign agent as defined by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which was simultaneously the focus of a Twitter campaign. On 20 September 2019, Twitter announced it had shut down two groups of accounts with links to UAE spreading disinformation primarily focused on Qatar. According to Bloomberg, the archive of the incriminated accounts tweets showed \\"hundreds of messages attacking Al-Jazeera\\". Organization The original Al Jazeera channel was launched 1 November 1996 by an emiri decree with a loan of 500 million Qatari riyals (US$137 million) from the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa.Hugh Miles, 2005.

Tauris, p. 57, Books.google.com By securing its funding through loans or grants rather than direct government subsidies, the channel seeks to maintain independent editorial policy.Naomi Sakr, 2001.

Al-Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the West. New York: Grove Press, p. 347, Books.Google.com The channel began broadcasting in late 1996, with many staff joining from the BBC World Service's Saudi-co-owned Arabic-language TV station, which had shut down on 1 April 1996 after two years of operation because of censorship demands by the Saudi Arabian government. The Al Jazeera logo is a decorative representation of the network's name written using Arabic calligraphy. It was selected by the station's founder, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, as the winning entry in a design competition. =Staff= Wadah Khanfar, Former Director General of Al Jazeera Media Network Al Jazeera restructured its operations to form a network that contains all their different channels. Wadah Khanfar, the then managing director of the Arabic Channel, was appointed as the director general of Al Jazeera Media Network. He also acted as the managing director of the original Arabic Channel. Khanfar resigned on 20 September 2011 proclaiming that he had achieved his original goals, and that 8 years was enough time for any leader of an organization, in an interview aired on Al Jazeera English. Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani replaced Khanfar and served as the director general of the channel from September 2011 to June 2013 when he was appointed minister of economy and trade. The chairman of the channel is Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani. The Director General and editor-in-chief of the Arabic website is Mostefa Souag, who replaced Ahmed Sheikh as editor-in-chief. It has more than 100 editorial staff. The managing director of Al Jazeera English is Al Anstey. Mohamed Nanabhay became editor-in-chief of the English-language site in 2009. Previous editors include Beat Witschi and Russell Merryman. Prominent on-air personalities include Faisal al-Qassem, host of the talk show The Opposite Direction, Ahmed Mansour, host of the show Without Borders (bi-la Hudud) and Sami Haddad. Its former Iran and Beirut Bureau Chief was Ghassan bin Jiddo. He became an influential figure on Al Jazeera with his program Hiwar Maftuh, one of the most frequently watched programs. He also interviewed Nasrallah in 2007 and produced a documentary about Hezbollah. Some suggested that he would even replace Wadah Khanfar. Bin Jiddo resigned after political disagreements with the station. Reach Many governments in the Middle East deploy state-run media or government censorship to impact local media coverage and public opinion, leading to international objections regarding press freedom and biased media coverage. Some scholars and commentators use the notion of contextual objectivity, which highlights the tension between objectivity and audience appeal, to describe the station's controversial yet popular news approach. Increasingly, Al Jazeera Media Network's exclusive interviews and other footage are being rebroadcast in American, British, and other western media outlets such as CNN and the BBC. In January 2003, the BBC announced that it had signed an agreement with Al Jazeera for sharing facilities and information, including news footage.BBC in news deal with Arabic TV BBC News, published 17 January 2003 Al Jazeera's availability (via satellite) throughout the Middle East changed the television landscape of the region. Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of freedom of speech on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program El-Itidjah el-Mouakass (\\"The Opposite Direction\\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen. TV programme feat. Lawrence Velvel, Dean of the Mass. School of Law, interviewing author Hugh Miles who reveals a lot about the channel (a, c: 48:30, b: 55:00) cf.Further reading By and large, however, Al Jazeera's popularity can be more substantively attributed to its in-depth coverage of issues considered to be of great importance to the international Arab population, many of which received minimal attention from other outlets, such as: the Palestinian perspective on the second Intifada, the experiences of Iraqis living through the Iraq war, and the exclusive broadcast of tapes produced by Osama Bin-Laden. At the time of the aforementioned incident in Algeria, Al Jazeera Media Network was not yet generally known in the Western world, but where it was known, opinion was often favorableE.g. in 1999, The New York Times reporter Thomas L. Friedman called Al-Jazeera \\"the freest, most widely watched TV network in the Arab world\\". ‚Äì and Al Jazeera claimed to be the only politically independent television station in the Middle East. However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by al-Qaeda leaders. Some observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the Columbia Journalism Review, argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.CJR.org, Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha? > The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a > shaper of public opinion.

Al Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \\"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\\", has been perceived as playing a part in the Arab Spring, including the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. The New York Times stated in January 2011: \\"The protests rocking the Arab world this week have one thread uniting them: Al Jazeera, ... whose aggressive coverage has helped propel insurgent emotions from one capital to the next.\\" The newspaper quoted Marc Lynch, a professor of Middle East Studies at George Washington University: \\"They did not cause these events, but it's almost impossible to imagine all this happening without Al Jazeera.\\"\\"Seizing a Moment, Al Jazeera Galvanizes Arab Frustration\\", The New York Times, 27 January 2011 With Al Jazeera's growing global outreach and influence, some scholars including Adel Iskandar have described the station as a transformation of the very definition of \\"alternative media.\\" Al Jazeera presents a new direction in the discourse of global news flow and shows voices underrepresented by traditional mainstream media regardless of global imbalances in the flow of information. Expansion In 2011, Al Jazeera Media Network launched Al Jazeera Balkans, which is based in Sarajevo and serves the ex-Yugoslavia region in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian. The look and feel of the network is similar to Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera launched a Turkish-language news website in 2014; it was shut down on 3 May 2017. =Al Jazeera English= Al Jazeera English newsroom In 2003, Al Jazeera hired its first English-language journalists, among whom was Afshin Rattansi, from the BBC's Today Programme. In March 2003, it launched an English-language website.aljazeera.com On 4 July 2005, Al Jazeera officially announced plans to launch a new English-language satellite service to be called Al Jazeera International. The new channel started at 12:00 GMT on 15 November 2006 under the name Al Jazeera English and has broadcast centers in Doha (next to the original Al Jazeera headquarters and broadcast center), London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C. The channel is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week news channel, with 12 hours broadcast from Doha, and four hours each from London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C. Al Jazeera launched an English language channel, originally called Al Jazeera International, in 2006. Among its staff were journalists hired from ABC's Nightline and other top news outfits. Josh Rushing, a former media handler for CENTCOM during the Iraq war, agreed to provide commentary; David Frost was also on board. In an interesting technical feat, the broadcast of the new operation was handed off between bases in Doha, London, Washington, D.C., and Kuala Lumpur on a daily cycle. The new English language venture faced considerable regulatory and commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes. At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the Arabic language. There were hundreds of millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be interested in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007. Today, evidence of U.S. antipathy at the Arabic network has dissipated significantly, though not entirely, several analysts say. =Al Jazeera America= In January 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network purchased Current TV, which was partially owned by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Using part of Current TV's infrastructure, Al Jazeera launched an American news channel on 20 August 2013. Though Current TV had large distribution throughout the United States on cable and satellite television, it averaged only 28,000 viewers at any time. The acquisition of Current TV by Al Jazeera allowed Time Warner Cable to drop the network due to its low ratings, but they released a statement saying that they would consider carrying the channel after they evaluated whether it made sense for their customers. Time Warner Cable later began carrying Al Jazeera America in December 2013. In August 2014, Gore and fellow shareholder Joel Hyatt launched a lawsuit against Al Jazeera claiming a residual payment of $65 million of the sale proceeds, due in 2014, remained unpaid. Al Jazeera later announced a countersuit. In 2016, the case was settled outside of court on the basis of a mutual agreement, under which: Gore and Hyatt had their claims waived, Al Jazeera was ordered to pay the $2.35 million in legal fees incurred by the plaintiffs, and the network forfeited its rights to pursue any indemnification claims related to the ordeal. On 13 January 2016, Al Jazeera America CEO Al Anstey announced that the network would cease operations on 12 April 2016, citing the \\"economic landscape\\". =Sport channels= beIN SPORTS, formerly Al Jazeera Sport channels, was legally separated from Al Jazeera Media Network on 1 January 2014 and is now controlled by beIN Media Group. beIN SPORTS currently operates three channels in France ‚Äì beIN Sport 1, beIN Sport 2 and beIN Sport MAX ‚Äì and launched two channels in the United States (English and Spanish) in August 2012.Al Jazeera to Kick Off Pair of Soccer Channels in U.S. this August Bleacher Report, 2 June 2012 The network also has a Canadian Channel and holds Canadian broadcast rights to several sports properties, The network also has an Australian channel. beIN Sport holds the rights to broadcast major football tournaments on French television, including Ligue 1, Bundesliga, the UEFA Champions League and the European Football Championships.

It had been available through live streaming over the Al Jazeera website, DVB-S, Galaxy 19, free to air and Galaxy 23 satellites, and it had been broadcast over the air in the Washington, DC DMA by WNVC on digital channel 30-5, and on digital channel 48.2 in the New York metro area, but those broadcasts were discontinued on 20 August 2013. Al Jazeera English had also been available to cable TV viewers in Toledo, Ohio, Burlington, Vermont, New York City (WRNN rebroadcast), Washington State, and Washington, D.C (a rebroadcast of WNVC's feed), but those sources were switched to Al Jazeera America on 20 August 2013. Many analysts had considered the limited availability of Al Jazeera English in the United States to be effectively a \\"blackout\\".Grim, Ryan (30 January 2011) Al Jazeera English Blacked Out Across Most Of U.S., The Huffington Post The live stream and programming over the internet that had been geoblocked was made available to viewers in the United States again in September 2016. Online. Al Jazeera English can be viewed over the Internet from their official website. The low-resolution version is available free of charge to users of computers and video streaming boxes,Aljazeera.com and the high-resolution version is available under subscription fees through partner sites. Al Jazeera's English division has also partnered with Livestation for Internet-based broadcasting. This enables Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera live to be watched worldwide. =On the web= Al Jazeera Media Network's web-based service is accessible subscription-free throughout the world, at a variety of websites. The station launched an English-language edition of its online content in March 2003. This English language website was relaunched on 15 November 2006, along with the launch of Al Jazeera English. The English and Arabic sections are editorially distinct, with their own selection of news and comment. Al Jazeera and Al Jazeera English are streamed live on the official site, as well as on YouTube. On 13 April 2009 Al Jazeera launched versions of its English and Arabic sites suitable for mobile devices. The Arabic version of the site was brought offline for about 10 hours by an FBI raid on its ISP, InfoCom Corporation, on 5 September 2001. InfoCom was later convicted of exporting to Syria and Gaddafi-ruled Libya, of knowingly being invested in by a Hamas member (both of which are illegal in the United States), and of underpaying customs duties. In 2014, Al Jazeera Media Network launched an online only channel called AJ+. The channel is based out of the former Current TV studios in San Francisco and has outposts in Doha, Kuala Lumpur and other locations. It is independent of all of Al Jazeera's other channels and is mostly in an on demand format. The channel launched on 13 June 2014 on with a preview on YouTube. This was followed in 2017 by the launch of Jetty, a podcast network which is also based out of the former Current TV studios in San Francisco. Al Jazeera recently launched a Mandarin-language news website. It is the first Arabic news provider to target the Chinese audience. The staff of the project will be in contact with their audience via Chinese social media like Weibo, Meipai and WeChat. Creative Commons On 13 January 2009 Al Jazeera Media Network released some of its broadcast quality footage from Gaza under a Creative Commons license. Contrary to business \\"All Rights Reserved\\" standards, the license invites third parties, including rival broadcasters, to reuse and remix the footage, so long as Al Jazeera is credited. The videos are hosted on blip.tv, which allows easy downloading and integration with Miro. Al Jazeera Media Network also offers over 2,000 Creative Commons-licensed still photos at their Flickr account. Citizen journalism Al Jazeera Media Network accepts user-submitted photos and videos about news events through a Your Media page, and this content may be featured on the website or in broadcasts. The channel used the Ushahidi platform to collect information and reports about the Gaza War, through Twitter, SMS and the website. =Plans= Future projects in other languages include Al Jazeera Urdu, an Urdu language channel to cater mainly to Pakistanis. A Kiswahili service called Al Jazeera Kiswahili was to be based in Nairobi and broadcast in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. However, those plans were cancelled due to budget constraints. The channel also has plans to launch a Spanish-language news network to cater mainly to Spain and Hispanic America, like the Iranian cable TV network HispanTV. Al Jazeera has also been reported to be planning to launch an international newspaper.Al Jazeera plans to launch Arab newspaper Arabian Business; 4 November 2006 Al Jazeera Arabic began using a chroma key studio on 13 September 2009. Similar to Sky News, Al Jazeera broadcast from that studio while the channel's main newsroom was given a new look. The channel relaunched, with new graphics and music along with a new studio, on 1 November 2009, the 13th birthday of the channel. Controversies  While Al Jazeera has a large audience in the Middle East, the organization and the original Arabic channel in particular have been criticised and involved in a number of controversies. =Bahrain= In May 2000, Bahrain banned Al Jazeera's broadcasts due to the channel's comments about Bahrain's municipal elections, labelling it as \\"serving Zionism\\". =United States= Several Al Jazeera staff were killed by U.S. military \\"friendly-fire\\" incidents. The United- States-controlled Iraqi interim government closed the offices of Al Jazeera in Baghdad in August 2004 during the United States occupation on Iraq. The interim Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi then accused the channel of \\"inciting hatred\\" in the country. At the end of April 2013, the Iraqi government led by Nouri Al Maliki once again ordered Al Jazeera to stop broadcasting due to the alleged role of the channel in \\"encouraging the sectarian unrest\\". In response to the restrictions imposed by Al Maliki, Al Jazeera issued a statement in which the organization expressed its astonishment at the development, and reiterated their assertion, \\"We cover all sides of the stories in Iraq, and have done for many years.\\" The network further objected to the ban, saying, \\"The fact that so many channels have been hit all at once though suggests this is an indiscriminate decision. We urge the authorities to uphold freedom for the media to report the important stories taking place in Iraq.\\" In 2019, congressman Jack Bergman wrote in the Washington Examiner that \\"Al Jazeera's record of radical anti-American, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel broadcasts warrants scrutiny from regulators to determine whether this network is in violation of US law\\". =Egypt's Tahrir Square= During the 2011 Egyptian protests, on 30 January the Egyptian government ordered the TV channel to close its offices. The next day Egyptian security forces arrested six Al Jazeera journalists for several hours and seized their camera equipment. There were also reports of disruption in Al Jazeera Mubasher's Broadcast to Egypt. The channel was also criticized for being sympathetic to Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood and former IAEA director Mohammed ElBaradei. It was closed for the same reasons in September 2013. Twenty-two members of staff of Al Jazeera's Egyptian bureau announced their resignation on 8 July 2013, citing biased coverage of the ongoing Egyptian power redistribution in favour of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al Jazeera says that the resignations were due to pressure from the Egyptian military. =Syria= Al Jazeera has been criticized over unfair coverage of the Syrian Civil War. The channel's reporting has been described as largely supportive of the rebels, while demonizing the Syrian government. The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir cited outtakes of interviews showing that the channel's staff coached Syrian eyewitnesses and fabricated reports of oppression by Syria's government. In January 2013, a former Al Jazeera employee from Syria stated their belief that there was ongoing strong pressure to conform to biased coverage of the Syrian Civil War.An exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel at AxisOfLoginAn exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel at FilmBoxOffice However, according to Pew Research Center study, in its coverage of the Syrian crisis, Al Jazeera America cable news channel provided viewers with content that often resembles what Americans saw on other U.S. cable news outlets. =India 5-day ban= The Indian government banned the Al Jazeera TV channel in April 2015 for five telecast days as it repeatedly displayed disputed maps of India. The suspension concerns maps of Pakistan used in 2013 and 2014 that did not demarcate the part of Kashmir under Pakistani control (Pakistan-administered Kashmir) as a separate territory. Once notified by Indian authorities, the channel said it ensured all maps from 22 September 2014, onward used dotted lines and unique shading for the disputed portions. =Israel= On 19 July 2008, Al Jazeera TV broadcast a program from Lebanon which covered the \\"welcome-home\\" festivities for Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese citizen who had been imprisoned in Israel for killing four people in a Palestine Liberation Front raid from Lebanon into Israel. In the program, the head of Al Jazeera's Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, praised Kuntar as a \\"pan-Arab hero\\" and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel's Government Press Office (GPO) announced a boycott of the channel, which was to include a general refusal by Israeli officials to be interviewed by the station, and a ban on its correspondents from entering government offices in Jerusalem. A few days later an official letter was issued by Al Jazeera's director general, Wadah Khanfar, in which he admitted that the program violated the station's Code of Ethics and that he had ordered the channel's programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident does not recur. On 15 March 2010, Channel Ten (Israel) broadcast a video story about the Coastal Road massacre on 11 March 1978, with two photographs of a victim and an attacker, both women, with Al Jazeera's logo. Photographer Shmuel Rahmani, who took these photos, sued Al Jazeera in the Jerusalem District Court, for copyright infringement of the two photographs. On 19 February 2014, the court ruled that Al Jazeera would pay 73,500 ILS to Rahmani.Articles 15 and 31 in the verdict which was made by the Judge Rafael Yaacobi on 19 February 2014 in case 45542-12-11, Shmuel Rahmani vs Al Jazeera International Limited and Al Jazeera Satellite Network On 23 November 2017, a second verdict of 30,000 ILS against Al Jazeera was made in the Nazareth District Court. At the end of 2017, a third lawsuit was brought by Michael Ganoe, an American Christian who has lived in Israel, in the Tel Aviv District Court, after infringing copyrights of his private videos of volunteering for the Israel Defense Forces, in which he was also compared by Al Jazeera to volunteering for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. On 15 November 2018, Ganoe won in a settlement deal 96,199 ILS from Al Jazeera. =Website attacks= Immediately after its launch in 2003, the English site was attacked by one or several hackers, who launched denial-of-service attacks, and another hacker who redirected visitors to a site featuring a Flag of the United States.Al Jazeera and the Net ‚Äì free speech, but don't say that by John Lettice; The Register; 7 April 2003Al-Jazeera hacker pleads guilty BBC News; 13 June 2003 Both events were widely reported as Al Jazeera's website having been attacked by \\"hackers\\". by Dominic Timms; Guardian Unlimited; 26 March 2003 In November 2003, John William Racine II, also known as 'John Buffo', was sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service and a $1,500 U.S. fine for the online disruption. Racine posed as an Al Jazeera employee to get a password to the network's site, then redirected visitors to a page he created that showed an American flag shaped like a U.S. map and a patriotic motto, court documents said.Al-Jazeera cracker charged by John Leyden; The Register; 12 June 2003 In June 2003, Racine pleaded guilty to wire fraud and unlawful interception of an electronic communication.Guilty plea in Al Jazeera site hackAl Jazeera hacker gets community service As of 2012, the perpetrators of the denial-of-service attacks remain unknown. =Shariah and Life= Shariah and Life (al-Sharƒ´ øa wa al-·∏§ayƒÅh) is an Al Jazeera Arabic show with an estimated audience of 60 million worldwide and stars Muslim preacher Yusuf al- Qaradawi, who is described as \\"Islam's Spiritual 'Dear Abby'\\".No.9 Sheikh Dr Yusuf al Qaradawi, Head of the International Union of Muslim Scholars ‚Äì \\"The 500 most influential Muslims in the world 2009\\", Prof John Esposito and Prof Ibrahim Kalin ‚Äì Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University The format of Sharia and Life is similar to that of al-Qaradawi's earlier programing on Qatar TV as well as Egyptian television shows going as far back as the 1960s. Programs interpreting the Quran or dealing with religious issues were popular from Morocco to Saudi Arabia. The now defunct show has been the repeated subject of controversy. In January 2009, Qaradawi stated: \\"Throughout history, Allah has imposed upon the [Jews] people who would punish them for their corruption. The last punishment was carried out by [Adolf] Hitler.\\" In October 2010, Qaradawi was asked if Muslims should acquire nuclear weapons \\"to terrorize their enemies.\\" Qaradawi said he was pleased Pakistan had such a weapon, that the goal of nuclear weapons would be permissible, and provided religious justification quoting Koranic verses urging Muslims \\"to terrorize thereby the enemy of God and your enemy.\\" Editorial independence Al Jazeera Media Network is a Private Foundation or Public Benefit under Qatari law. Under this structure, Al Jazeera Media Network receives funding from the government of Qatar, but maintains its editorial independence. Critics have accused Al Jazeera of supporting the positions of the Qatari government though Al Jazeera platforms and channels have published content that has been critical of Qatar or has run counter to Qatari laws and norms. Al Jazeera's editorial independence has been affirmed by journalism associations and organizations including the National Press Club and Reporters Without Borders. In 2010, United States Department of State internal communications, released by WikiLeaks as part of the 2010 diplomatic cables leak, said that the Qatar government manipulates Al Jazeera coverage to suit political interests. In September 2012, The Guardian reported that Al Jazeera's editorial independence came into question when the channel's director of news, Salah Negm, stepped in at the last minute to order that a two-minute video covering a UN debate over the Syrian civil war include a speech by the leader of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Although the order came from internal editorial staff, staff members protested that the speech was not the most important aspect of the debate, and that it was a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention. Documentaries * Al Jazeera's coverage of the invasion of Iraq was the focus of a documentary film, Control Room (2004) by Egyptian-American director Jehane Noujaim. * In July 2003, PBS broadcast a documentary called Exclusive to al-Jazeera on its program Wide Angle. * In 2008, Al Jazeera filmed Egypt: A Nation in Waiting, which documented trends in Egypt's political history and foreshadowed the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.Egypt: A Nation in Waiting Retrieved . * Another documentary, Al Jazeera, An Arab Voice for Freedom or Demagoguery? The UNC Tour was filmed two months after 11 September 2001 Terrorist Attack. * ISIL and the Taliban. Filmed in 2015 by an Arab Al Jazeera reporter named Najibullah Quraishi, it covers Islamic State's presence in Afghanistan and how they groom children for their causes. It is about Taliban commanders angry about Islamic State's presence, Afghan National Army starting offensives in Achin and 2 suicide bombers targeting Jandal, a former warlord. * Tutu's Children (2017), a documentary about Desmond Tutu's experiment of coaching young professionals to be African leaders. * The Lobby TV series, is about an undercover Al Jazeera reporter who infiltrates several pro-Israel advocacy organizations in Washington, D.C. including Stand With Us, The Israel Project, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Israel on Campus Coalition, and the Zionist Organization of America's (ZOA) Fuel For Truth. * Four Dead in Ohio (2010), a documentary about the 1970 Kent State shootings at Kent State University. Also known as the 4 May Massacre or the Kent State Massacre, the incident involved unarmed college students shot by Ohio National Guard members on campus during a mass protest against bombing of Cambodia by U.S. military forces. Awards * In March 2003, Al Jazeera was awarded by Index on Censorship for its \\"courage in circumventing censorship and contributing to the free exchange of information in the Arab world.\\"Index: Free speaking voices in the wilderness * In April 2004, the Webby Awards nominated Al Jazeera as one of the five best news Web sites, along with BBC News, National Geographic, RocketNews and The Smoking Gun. According to Tiffany Shlain, the founder of the Webby Awards, this caused a controversy as [other media organisations] \\"felt it was a risk-taking site\\". * In 2004, Al Jazeera was voted by brandchannel.com readers as the fifth most influential global brand behind Apple Computer, Google, IKEA and Starbucks. * In January 2013, Al Jazeera was nominated for the Responsible Media of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards. Competitors * Al Mayadeen is a pan-Arabist Shia- centric satellite television channel supported by the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was launched on 11 June 2012 in Lebanon. The channel, claims Gulf- supported media, aims at reducing the influence of the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya networks, both funded by oil-rich Sunni Arab countries in the Persian Gulf. However, it is said to plan to present an alternative to mainstream Arab satellite media, largely dominated by these two channels. * In response to Al Jazeera, a group of Saudi investors created Al Arabiya in the first quarter of 2003. Despite (especially initial) skepticism over the station's Saudi funding (cf. History) and a perception of censorship of anti-Saudi content, Al Arabiya has successfully emulated Al Jazeera, garnered a significant audience share, and has also become involved in controversy ‚Äì Al Arabiya has been severely criticised by the Iraqi and US authorities and once had journalists killed on the job. * In order to counter a perceived bias of Al Jazeera, the U.S. government in 2004 founded Al Hurra (\\"the free one\\"). Al Hurra is forbidden to broadcast to the US under the provisions of the Smith‚ÄìMundt Act. A Zogby poll found that 1% of Arab viewers watch Al Hurra as their first choice. while an Ipsos-MENA poll from March‚ÄìMay 2008 showed that Al Hurra was drawing more viewers in Iraq than Al Jazeera. Citing these figures, Alvin Snyder, author and former USIA executive, referred to Al Hurra as a \\"go to\\" network in Iraq. * Another competitor is Al Alam, established in 2003 by Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, which broadcasts continuously. It seeks to address the most challenging issues of the Shia Muslim and Arab world and the Middle East. * A further competitor is the Rusiya Al-Yaum channel ‚Äì the first Russian TV news channel broadcasting in Arabic and headquartered in Moscow, Russia. Rusiya Al- Yaum started broadcasting on 4 May 2007. The Channel is established and operated by RIA Novosti, the same news agency that launched Russia Today TV in December 2005 to deliver a Russian perspective on news to English-speaking audiences, and \\"Rusiya Al-Yaum\\" is indeed a translation of \\"Russia Today\\" into Arabic. * The BBC launched BBC Arabic Television on 11 March 2008, an Arabic- language news channel in North Africa and the Middle East. This is the second time that the BBC has launched an Arabic language TV channel; as mentioned above, the demise of the original BBC World Service Arabic TV channel had at least contributed to the founding of the original Al Jazeera Arabic TV channel. * Deutsche Welle began broadcasting in Arabic in 2002. On 12 September 2011, the German international broadcaster launched DW (Arabia), its Arabic language television channel for North Africa and the Middle East. The network has expanded from an initial two-hour block to 16 hours of daily programming in Arabic starting March 2014. The schedule is completed with 8 hours of English language programming. In February 2014, DW (Arabia) announced the acquisition of reprise transmission rights of Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef's popular show AlBernameg. * When Euronews started broadcasting its programs in Arabic on 12 July 2008, it entered into competition with Al Jazeera. Arabic is the eighth language in which Euronews is broadcast, after English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. * Since the launch of Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera directly competes with BBC World and CNN International, as do a growing number of other international broadcasters such as Deutsche Welle, France 24, NHK World, RT, Press TV, CGTN, and PTV World.

Slicher commenced his studies in history at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen in 1930 and moved to Utrecht in 1934 where he studied under the German medievalist Otto Oppermann. Having graduated in 1936, he took an assistant position with Oppermann, typing the professor's manuscripts and maintaining his library, which brought him into contact with the journal Annales d'histoire √©conomique et sociale. Slicher van Bath then worked for some time as an archivist in Gelderland, being able to avoid conscription as a former sufferer of polio, and returned to Oppermann's service in 1941. Oppermann's research interests took an ever more ideological turn toward national socialism; when he suggested, in 1942, that Slicher should research the Dutch role in the Ostsiedlung, Slicher quit his job. During the war time, Slicher van Bath pursued a doctorate degree, initially with Oppermann but soon with the Amsterdam-based historian Jan Romein, visiting Romein at his home and later at his hiding place. The thesis was finished in 1944, the doctorate degree awarded half a year after the end of World War II in November 1945. Slicher van Bath finally settled in Wageningen, where he was appointed special professor in agrarian history and formed what was termed the \\"Wageningen school\\" of quantitative history (a label that Slicher vehemently rejected, not wishing to be constrained by the methods of any particular \\"school\\"). At the request of the Cambridge Economic History of Europe's editorial board, Slicher van Bath wrote The agrarian history of Western Europe, AD 500‚Äì1850, his magnum opus (initially published in Dutch as De agrarische geschiedenis van West-Europa (500‚Äì1850), 1960). The book got him a guest professorship at the University of Chicago (1967‚Äì68), where Slicher van Bath became interested in the methods of the new economic history and shifted his attention to the history of Latin America. The history of this continent, rather than Annales-style regional studies of the Netherlands and Western Europe, would be his primary research topic until his 1975 retirement.

He was a member of the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848, and after 1871 a member of the national Reichstag. He was also, at various stages, a member of the Saxony Landtag (regional parliament). Life =Early years= Wilhelm Michael Schaffrath was born, one of his parent's ten children, in Sch√∂na, a small town in southern Saxony, close to the frontier with Austria. Two years after his birth the family relocated in connection with his father's work the short distance to Lauterbach (Stolpen). His father, Michael Gotthold Schaffrath, worked at one stage as a master weaver, and later, in Lauterbach, as a village school teacher. Because the family was poor they were obliged to live in the school house, and from the age of eight Wilhelm was contributing to the family budget by working as a part-time shepherd boy. Wilhelm was identified early on by the local priest as a talented scholar, and his ability was encouraged, notably by the Stolpen deacon who taught him Latin. The Stolpen municipality awarded him a free school place which enabled him to obtain a first-class education at the Saint Afra School for gifted students in the city of Meissen. Here he was talent-spotted by the crown prince Frederick (who later became King Frederick August II) who facilitated Schaffrath's entry to the Law faculty at Leipzig University in order to study Jurisprudence. He completed his first degree in only three years, and took his doctorate a year after that, receiving his teaching qualification. At the age of 23 Wilhelm Schaffrath prepared to settle down to an academic career. Events intervened, however. During the time that he was working for his doctorate he undertook the legal defense of 19 Student Association (Burschenschaft) members who had faced charges of \\"participation in secret and revolutionary associations\\" (¬ªwegen Teilnahme an geheimen und revolution√§ren Verbindungen¬´). The charges arose because membership of a student association was at the time considered sufficient to support them. The defendants were convicted and faced several years of detention. Schaffrath succeeded in obtaining their acquittal at an appeal hearing before the High Court (\\"K√∂niglich-S√§chsische Oberappellationsgericht\\") at Dresden. He then took the matter a stage further by publishing a report of the case. As a result, he found himself denied a university teaching post, or indeed any job in public service. In 1840 he was elected a district judge in Sebnitz and in 1841 mayor in M√ºhltroff, but he was not able to take up either position because the central government refused to confirm the appointments. =A career in law and politics= In 1841 Schaffrath set himself up as a lawyer in Neustadt bei Stolpen where in 1842 he was elected as a town councillor. In 1845/46 he was able to participate in the Saxony regional assembly (Landtag) as an \\"urban deputy\\" following an exhaustive investigation by the authorities which failed to find any reason to block the election result. He was described by the liberal radical contemporary Bernhard Hirschel as the \\"conscience\\" of the assembly (‚ÄûRechtsgewissen‚Äú der Zweiten Kammer) because of his \\"exceptional legal knowledge\\" (wegen seiner ‚Äûau√üerordentlichen Gesetzkenntnis‚Äú). It was also during this time that he developed his friendship with the Leipzig based politician and democracy-activist, Robert Blum. Together they produced two politically radical newspapers entitled \\"Verfassungsfreund\\" (\\"The Constitution's Friend \\")\\"Verfassungsfreund\\" was the title of a number of radical liberal publications in various parts of Germany at this time. and the \\"S√§chsischen Vaterlandsbl√§tter\\" (\\"The Saxony Fatherland's journal\\"). Schaffrach was present at meetings of the Hallgarten Circle, and was elected a member of the Frankfurt Parliament when it convened in May 1848. Because of his participation in the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848/49 he was unable to return to the Saxony Landtag. Instead he remained in Frankfurt. He did not join in the popular uprising later in 1848, but was still a member of the Frankfurt parliament when it relocated to Stuttgart, and was still a member of what came to be known as the \\"Stuttgart Rump Parliament\\" when it was closed down at gunpoint in June 1849. After the year of revolutions he emigrated to Switzerland where he successfully claimed political asylum till 1852. He returned to Saxony and was able to negotiate a full judicial pardon, which opened the way for a return to his political career. He returned to Neustadt bei Stolpen where in 1852 he became an authorized public notary. In 1856 he relocated to Dresden, where in 1872 he obtained permission to undertake public notary work. The move to Dresden was followed by an almost ten-year break in his political career. Schaffrath was one of the founders, in 1863, of the \\"Saxony Progressive Association\\" (\\"S√§chsischen Fortschrittsverein\\"), the Saxony component of what was becoming the pan-German left-wing liberal Progressive Party. Between 1865 and 1872 he sat as a member of the Dresden City Council, remaining active in city politics till the mid 1870s. In February 1867 he was elected as a Progress Party member to the Reichstag of the newly created North German Confederation. Both the confederation and its Reichstag proved short-lived. Following unification, however, in 1871 they were replaced by a new German state and a new national Parliament (\\"Reichstag\\"). Wilhelm Schaffrath was a member between March 1871 and 1874, and again between 1878 and 1879. At the same time, in October 1871 he was also elected a member of the Saxony Landtag (regional parliament), where he would sit as a member till 1879. Despite the unceremonious nature of his exclusion from the chamber in 1849, following his high-profile participation in the political aspects of the \\"events\\" of 1848, in 1871 he was promptly elected president of the Saxony Second Chamber, and the king confirmed the appointment. However, he lost the presidency of the chamber in 1875 following fresh regional elections in 1874 which had given the conservative parties a majority in the chamber, and the presidency passed to Ludwig Haberkorn. During the ten years from 1883 till his death he served as an elected judge in the Saxony district court. He also undertook other senior functions of a political and administrative nature, both locally and on a national level.

The visitors opened well and starting off at a brisk pace opened the score from a penalty taken by Finnegan, and Wynne tipped over a point. Ballybay's big following sent their hats in the air over this sweeping bit of play. Tassan soon settled down, Maguire sending in a rasping shot that found the net. Several rushes by the home side were successfully warded off by Duffy and Dowd on the defence line and Ballybay was leading by a point at half time. On the change over Mulligan leveled the score and Wynne was again in the limelight for Pearse Bros. Excitement ran high when he put the town lads leading by a goal. Tassan's turn came when their sure shot Maguire drew even. Up to this the contest was an equal battle, but towards the close Tassan took over control and kept scoring at regular intervals. Final result Tassan 4 goals 5 points ; Ballybay 2 goals 2 points. The forward line from the town was a weak combination that needs overhauling. The defence was praiseworthy, but it was impossible to hold those hefty gaels from the border. Mr. P. Duffy was an impartial referee.\\" The Northern Standard, 26 March 1937 =Junior, Ballybay 2-1; Tassan 0-7= The return game with Ballybay was recorded in the Northern Standard on 9 April 1937: \\"Sunday last saw a great turnout of people to the Athletic grounds where the County Board had arranged a double fixture. The opening Junior tie was between Tassan and Ballybay. The town team playing with the wind were slow to settle down. For the first 15 minutes the exchanges were kept in mid-field, then John Wynne that clever forward, moved up and scored the first point. After this there was good tackling and the contest grew livelier. Several onsloughts by Tassan tested the Ballybay backs and the second score came to Tassan when in a melee round the Ballybay goals, Mc Elroy tipped over. The visitors kept pressing and added two further minors and the score at half time was Tassan 3 points ; Ballybay 1 point. On the change over Ballybay got away, their forwards, Wynne, M. West and Linden, in good hand passing, netted a goal per West. On the kick out Leo Kearney rushed into the net from about 20 yards out. Tassan then pointed per F. Mulligan (2), Mc Elroy (2), and the full time result read: Ballybay Pearse Bros. 2 goals, 1 point; Tassan 7 points. Mr. Flanagan was an impartial referee.\\" The Northern Standard, 9 April 1937 =Tassan 3-2; Latton 1-0= The next game was covered on page 7 of the Northern Standard Friday 23 April 1937: \\"Latton juniors made a rather poor display in their opening game of the season at home on Sunday against Tassan. They need a lot of training on the nice points of the game. Tassan, a new team, are a well selected team of promising youths, who bid fair to shed lustre on central Clontibret this season. Latton made a brilliant opening and were first to goal per Carragher, who with Mc Guinness and Mc Cabe made a strong trio. Wm Mc Caughey from a rasping shot replied for Tassan. When the visitors spread out they took possession, Maguire pointing and Mc Mahon goaling, put the issue beyond the region of doubt. Several tries by Latton saw the forwards finish weakly and the Clontibret team won easily on the score: - Tassan 3 goals, 2 points ; Latton 1 goal. Mr. Sweeney made an admirable referee. Tassan were well served by J. Connor in goals, P. Brennan (capt.), Mulligan, Morgan, Maguire, Mullen (2), Woods, Mohan, McMahon, Cravens, M. Brennan.\\"The Northern Standard, 23 April 1937 =Junior, Doohamlet 1-1; Tassan 0-4= Recorded in the Northern Standard from Friday 14 May 1937: \\"There was a stiff tussle for honours in the Junior game at Tassan on Sunday where Doohamlet travelled and was early to goal per M Cormack. Tassan made several drives to reply but O'Neill's concentrated on defence work and Mc Gahey's scores were restricted to minors. However, he tipped over three, but Keenan put his side ahead by a point and looked like winning when near the close Craven's drew level.

Tassan is an historic townland in Clontibret, near Annyalla, where Archbishop Sylvester Mulligan was born. Latton went over there last Sunday for a junior league fixture and a fast game of points resulted. These minor scores came frequently throughout the hour as every inch of sod was contested and it was mere luck that give the same side victory on score : Tassan Rovers, 9 points ; Latton O'Rahilly's, 7 points\\"The Northern Standard, 28 May 1937 =Promising progression in the division, 1937= By 18 June 1937, Tassan had progressed to the top of the Mid - Monaghan Junior division with 9 points on the table, two points ahead of Doohamlet, three points ahead of Castleblayney and seven points ahead of Ballybay and Latton. 1938 1938 commenced with a pre-season friendly against Cremartin on 25 February, listed on the Tassan team were T.

It was the only fixture of note in central Monaghan last Sunday and as both sides have won honours on the field many who followed the fortunes of the game were anxious to see them play. The Shamrocks were a little lucky to get a great goal win, but they adapted themselves better to the prevailing local conditions and made good ground work. Maguire was prominent for the visitors, and Atkinson got into his usual stride near the close to win for the home team.

Britain and France then declared war on Germany after Hitler had refused to abort the invasion. Ireland which was neutral depended on supplies of coal and fuel from Britain. The main industry in Ireland was agriculture, many small farms in Tassan produced flax, potatoes, corn, vegetables and had an abundance of bog which provided fuel to neighboring areas. The closeness of the border with Armagh also provided an opportunity to make an income from smuggling goods and supplies which were scarce on either side, this was always risky but the challenge of evading the Customs and making a few bob was attractive and fostered a sense of close community spirit and resilience during difficult times. The outbreak of war disrupted the fixture list for football games, rationing of fuel made it difficult for players to get to games, scarcity of the day to day items lead to rationing of tea, sugar and other goods, the reporting on games was also impacted by a shortage of paper. Ireland remained neutral during the war and a state of emergency was declared in 1939, which included censorship of the press and correspondence. The local paper focused on events in Europe and on National issues with little emphasis being placed on sporting activities. * Northern Standard extract Friday 17 March 1939.

Because of the outbreak of war the 1939 Junior football competitions were not completed until 1940. Tassan played Cremartin in the 1939, Dr. Ward Cup Semi-Final in their new pitch located in Annyalla at the end of March 1940.The final score on 31 March 1940, was Tassan 1 ‚Äì 3, Cremartin 0 ‚Äì 3, with Tassan progressing to the Dr. Ward Cup Final. 1940 =GAA Ward Cup Final, Killany 1-3; Tassan 1-3= Northern Standard extract Friday 12 April 1940: Report on the 1939 Dr. Ward Cup Final drawn game held between Tassan and Killanny in Castleblayney on Sunday 7 April 1940. \\"It was probably due to the Second World War and the restriction censorship requirement for secrecy, that the names of players were omitted from the Northern Standard reports of the Dr. Ward Cup final.\\" \\"Killanny and Tassan played a drawn game in the Junior Ward Cup final at Castleblayney on Sunday. It was a thrilling game; Killanny having much the better of the play in the first half. Both teams, however, played good football, Tassan in the second half showing up well, and a draw was a fitting result. Killanny had the advantage of a strong breeze in the first half, and after a few minutes play had two points to their credit. The tackling was keen but clean and Killanny would have had many scores but for good and keen play on the part of Tassan fulls. Killanny succeeded in scoring a goal just before the half time whistle, but Tassan who had many chances failed to register a score. With the advantage of the breeze in the second half Tassan attacked strongly and after ten minutes play raised the white flag and followed this up with a further minor. Killanny were not to be denied and worked back to the other end where they sent over for a point to again take the lead. Tassan now fought keenly and missed several easy chances of scoring. Maintaining the attack, Tassan stormed the sticks but after being beaten off several times they returned to score the equalizer just before the final whistle went; leaving score ;- KILLANNY, 1-3; TASSAN, 1-3. It was a well contested game and the re-play will be eagerly looked forward to. Mr. Duffy, Ballybay , refereed.\\" =GAA Ward Cup Final replay, Killany 0-2; Tassan 1-1= Northern Standard extract Friday 26 April 1940: The 1939 Dr. Ward Cup Final re-play between Tassan and Killanny was held in Castleblayney on Sunday 21 April 1940. \\"TASSAN‚ÄôS TRIUMPH\\" \\"There were two finals played in Castleblayney on Sunday ‚Äì the re-play of the Dr. Ward Cup and the Minor final. The latter game between Inniskeen and Castleblayney preceded the cup final. Blayney won the minor final by five points. Towards the end of the Minor game rain commenced to fall, and continued heavily throughout the cup game. It proved to be a great game not withstanding the heavy rain, and although most of the spectators were drenched to the skin they remained on the side line to the end. Only a fortnight previously the teams treated the spectators, at the same venue, to a thrilling game which ended in a draw. The replay was eagerly looked forward to, and once again the spectators were treated to a great game, marred only by the rain and slippery pitch. Killanny won the toss and had the advantage of a slight breeze. Both teams were playing well having regard to the conditions and the ball was flicked from end to end at a very fast pace. The Tassan back line was exceptionally good, and many attempts on the Killanny forwards to get through failed. After a spirited attack Tassan sent through for goal and then followed a point. Killanny worked down and had two points from close frees. Then followed splendid play in kicking, passing and catching. The tackling was keen but clean, and on the whole the football was of a high standard. There were no further scores in this half . Half time score;- TASSAN 1 GOAL, 1 POINT ; KILLANNY 2 POINTS. On resumption Killanny attacked vigorously, and the Tassan goalie brought off a great save. Tassan were next attacking but a wide resulted. Up and down play followed for a considerable time, and it was surprising the high standard of football served up having regard to the conditions prevailing. Time and again Tassan back line held up the Killanny onslaughts, and returned the ball to the other end. Back came Killanny but still they could not get through and as the ball each time was flicked out of the Tassan goal mouth loud applause was heard from the Tassan supporters. Time was now running short, and Tassan put the game beyond all doubt by sending through a rasper to the net. Killanny were not discouraged, and in a lightning raid looked like getting through but the Tassan goalie brought off a great save. Renewing the attack Killanny had a point just before the final whistle went, leaving the score; TASSAN 2 GOALS, 1 POINT ; KILLANNY 3 POINTS. Mr. T Bradley, Castleblayney refereed both games. Following the Tassan team's victory over Killanny there were great celebrations locally in Tassan when bonfires were lit at road junctions and the victory was celebrated in Peter Flanagan's barn. A victory dance was arranged for St. Mary's hall where there was a large attendance of support from all areas of the parish. The Dr. Ward Cup final triumph by Tassan was the pinnacle of the teams success and instilled a sense of pride and achievement locally during the dark years of World War II. * Northern Standard extract Friday 24 May 1940 page 6.

The scarcity of resources and rationing had taken its tole on the community and by 1943 the Tassan Rovers team was no longer functioning. With the ending of the war in 1945 the Clontibret O‚Äô Neills team was re- formed. 1977 reunion Picture by Boylan Studios shows six survivors of the Tassan team which won the 1939 Dr. Ward Cuo at a meeting in the Braeside Ballroom, Clontibret, on Monday night last to make arrangements for the belated presentations of the medals in the Braeside on Thursday, 28 April.

He specialises in keyhole surgery for bowel cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, hernias and gall stones, amongst other conditions. Qureshi underwent undergraduate training at King‚Äôs Colleg Hospital in London. His ‚ÄòHouse Jobs‚Äô were of Professorial Units, a House Physician to Professors McGregor and Swift at King‚Äôs College Hospital and House Surgeon to Professors Bailey and Marks at the Royal Surrey County Hospital. He spent a year at the busy accident and emergency department of King‚Äôs College Hospital, London. Following his basic surgical training in West Sussex, he was appointed to Higher Surgical Training in the Wessex region, finishing his surgical apprenticeship with a laparoscopic fellowship in Portsmouth with Professor Parvaiz. Qureshi was appointed as a Consultant Laparoscopic Surgeon at Poole NHS Foundation Trust and was asked to introduce the latest laparoscopic techniques for bowel cancer surgery. He was also tasked with establishing an ‚ÄòEnhanced Recovery Programme‚Äô, the success of which was recognised when the programme he set up was short-listed for the National Patient Safety Awards in 2011. Since his appointment, Qureshi has been the Lead Laparoscopic Surgeon and also Enhanced Recovery Lead. Soon after his arrival, Qureshi was invited to form part of the nationally accredited Dorset Endometriosis Centre and is the Lead General Surgeon for this. Qureshi‚Äôs expertise was recognised in 2011 when he was selected by the Department of Health to become a national trainer in Laparoscopic Surgery (LAPCO). This role required him to teach and assess other Consultant Surgeons around the UK, to ensure they were safe to perform laparoscopic surgery. In more recent years, Qureshi was asked to form part of a faculty which trains consultant surgeons in other countries. The aim is to disseminate safe laparoscopic techniques so these surgeons can set up training programmes in their own countries. He also offers an international Laparoscopic Fellowship in Poole. Qureshi has strong links with the local University in Bournemouth; he is clinical supervisor at the National Centre for Computer Animation at the university. The aim of this project is to develop a laparoscopic simulator which would help train surgeons in advanced laparoscopic techniques. During his time at Poole Hospital, Qureshi has attracted significant funds enabling the hospital to purchase ¬£4 million worth of equipment. This included a ‚Äòstate of the art‚Äô Integrated Laparoscopic Theatre in 2009. More recently, the generosity of one of his patients, Robert Braithwaite (CEO Sunseeker), has enabled Qureshi to purchase a surgical robot which will increase the precision offered during cancer surgery. Personal Qureshi is married, with a family.

Alternatively, seipin can be referred to as Bernardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 protein (BSCL2), and it is encoded by the corresponding gene of the same name, i.e. BSCL2. At protein level, seipin is expressed in cortical neurons in the frontal lobes, as well as motor neurons in the spinal cord. It is highly expressed in areas like the brain, testis and adipose tissue. Seipin's function is still unclear but it has been localized close to lipid droplets, and cells knocked out in seipin which have anomalous droplets. Hence, recent evidence suggests that seipin plays a crucial role in lipid droplet biogenesis.  Function  Though it was initially dubbed \\"mysterious protein\\", recent empirical studies are gradually starting to unveil some of seipin's most compelling physiological functions. Among these, the following have been identified: central regulation of energy homeostasis, lipid catabolism (essential for adipocyte differentiation), lipid storage and lipid droplet maintenance, as well as prevention of ectopic lipid droplet formation in non-adipose tissues. Additionally, mutations of BSCL2 have been recently linked to the Silver-Syndrome and Celia's Encephalopathy. Seipin. Subcellular location  Structure  =Primary structure= The seipin gene BSCL2 was originally identified in mammals and the fruit fly, and later extended to fungi and plants. The human seipin gene is located on chromosome 11q13, with protein coding on the Crick strand. There are three validated coding transcripts in GenBank. The primary transcript originally described, contained 11 exons with protein coding beginning on exon 2 and ending in exon 11 (transcript variant 2), resulting in a 398 amino acid protein with two strongly predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs), coded in exons 2 and 7 (isoform 2). However, a longer transcript (variant 1) is generated with an alternative first exon containing a translational start site that results in an additional 64 amino acids at the N-terminal extension, 462 amino acids in total (isoform 1). A third coding transcript (variant 3) splices out exon 7 and produces a shortened and altered carboxy terminus in exon 10, generating a protein of 287 amino acids (isoform 3). =Secondary structure= The secondary structure of seipin includes a conserved central core domain, and diverse cytosolic N- and C-termini. =Tertiary structure= The protein has a short cytoplasmic region, a transmembrane alpha-helix, a water-soluble beta- sandwich domain located in endoplasmic reticulum, and second TM helix. Pathophysiology There are three different variations of seipin's amino acid sequence: * a N ‚Üí S change in position 88, does not affect protein subcellular location. * a S ‚Üí L change in position 90, does not affect the function in lipid storage. * a A ‚Üí P change in position 212 that increases localization to nuclear envelope. All seipin mutations occur within its loop domain. Between some of these, four large deletions can be found which indicate that at least exons 4 and 5 are required for seipin function in humans. In addition, other six mutations have been identified in the loop domain. The majority of these cluster at the single asparagine-linked glycosylation site (NVS) in seipin. The two mutations that cause neuronal seipinopathy, N88S and S90L, are located directly within this site. Apart from suspending the glycosylation process, these mutations engender an aggregation of seipin and, consequently, the initiation of the ER stress response. The seipin protein can also have a modification residue, that can transform the 289‚Äô and 372‚Äô serine into a phosphoserine, an ester of serine and phosphoric acid. Overexpression of mutated seipin proteins N88S or S90L can also activate autophagy, and substantially altering the sub-cellular distribution of the autophagosome marker GFP-LC3, which leads to a number of large vacuoles appearing in the cytoplasm. The sub-cellular location of GFP-LC3 and mutated seipin proteins highly overlap. Moreover, these seipin proteins can diffuse small lipid droplets to fuse into larger lipid. Seipin mutations have been associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (see below), and mutations in an N-glycosylation motif links seipin to two other disorders, i.e. Silver syndrome and autosomal-dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V.  Disease associations  = Congenital generalized lipodystrophy = CGL (congenital generalized lipodystrophy) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by almost complete loss of adipose tissue (both metabolic and mechanical adipose depots) and an increase of ectopic fat storage in liver and muscle. Of the four CGL types, BSCL2 (Berardinelli-Seip Congenital lipodystrophy type 2), resulting from mutations in the BSCL2/seipin gene, exhibits the most severe lipodystrophic phenotype. Furthermore, these patients could suffer dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to a cell-autonomous defect in cardiomyocytes. = Neurological seipinopathies = For many years mutations of the seipin gene were associated with a loss of function, such as in CGL (see above). However, recent studies show that mutations such as N88S and S90L seem to have a gain-of-toxic-function which may result in autosomal dominant motor neuron diseases and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. Owing to the wide clinical spectrum of these mutations, it has been proposed to collectively refer to seipin-related motor neuron diseases as seipinopathies. Symptoms can vary and include: developmental regression of motor and cognitive skills in the first years of life leading to death (encephalopathy), muscle weakness and spasticity in lower limbs (spastic paraplegia type XVII), weakness of distal muscles of upper limbs (distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V) as well as wasting of the hand muscles (in both cases). Complex forms of seipinopathies may include deafness, dementia or mental retardation. = Male infertility = Testicular tissue-derived seipin is essential for male fertility by modulating testicular phospholipid homeostasis. The lack of seipin in germ cells results in complete male infertility and teratozoospermia. Spermatids devoid of seipin in germ cells are morphologically abnormal with large ectopic lipid droplets and aggregate in dysfunctional clusters. Elevated levels of phosphatidic acid accompanied with an altered ratio of polyunsaturated to monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids show impaired phospholipid homeostasis during spermiogenesis .

He was Minister of Public Works in 1928‚Äì29. After leaving politics in 1936, he was administrator of the French arm of Hispano- Suiza, the automobile and armaments manufacturer. Early years (1888‚Äì1914) Pierre Forgeot was born on 10 March, 1888 in Anglure, Marne. His grandfather was a train conductor on the line between Paris and Troyes who settled in Anglure after his marriage to Eug√©nie Duterme and became a small manufacturer of bonnets. His father, Gustave Forgeot, was a businessman. Gustave was mayor of Anglure from 1898 to 1919 and from 1925 to 1927, councilor of the canton of Anglure from 1895 to 1899 and councilor-general from 1899 to 1927. He owned a vineyard and was a Radical. Pierre Forgeot studied law in Paris. He was admitted to the bar in 1909, and became secretary to the Conf√©rence des avocats. He obtained his Doctorate in Law in 1911 for a brilliant thesis on Les lapins de garenne devant la loi et la jurisprudence (Cottontail rabbits before the law and jurisprudence). Political career (1914‚Äì36) In the general elections of 26 April 1914 Forgeot ran on the Federation of the Left platform for the 3rd district of Reims. He won in the second round. He was the second-youngest member of the chamber of deputies. Forgeot was noted for his eloquence in the chamber of deputies. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he was not mobilized, and was involved in issues of requisitions, rents and war damages. In the elections of 16 November 1919 Forgeot was elected on the platform of the conservative Entente r√©publicaine d√©mocratique. He joined the committees on Finance, Customs and Liberated Regions. When Aristide Briand formed his government in January 1921 Forgeot immediately asked him whether he wanted to fully calculate all damages before presenting a bill for World War I reparations to Germany, which could take some time, or whether he would make an arbitrary but final claim, which would be faster but could be for a lesser amount. Briand avoided giving a straight answer. Forgeot and Andr√© Tardieu denounced the London Schedule of Payments of 5 May 1921, but the majority voted to approve it. Forgeot did not compete in the election of 11 May 1924. After the election of Maurice de Rothschild in the Hautes-Alpes was invalidated he ran in the by-election of 3 October 1925, but was defeated. Forgeot was elected for √âpernay on the Republican-Socialist platform in the elections of 22 April 1928. He joined the committees on Commerce & Industry, Liberated Regions, Public Works and Civil & Criminal Law. He was appointed Minister of Public Works in the cabinet of Raymond Poincar√© on 11 November 1928. He retained that post in the cabinet of Aristide Briand from 29 July 1929 to 3 November 1929. He was reelected for √âpernay in the elections of 1 May 1932. Forgeot left politics in 1936. Later career (1936‚Äì56) Forgeot became president of the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 he arranged for the Mateu family, owners of the Spanish parent, to move to France. From there Miquel Mateu went to Burgos to report to General Francisco Franco. Under the law of 1936 the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza was obliged to concentrate on making war material for the French forces. The French company ceased automobile manufacture and concentrated on production of aircraft engines. A wind tunnel was built in Bois-Colombes for testing engines. Forgeot objected to interference in the company operations by the Minister for Industrial Production. On 10 March 1938 L√©on Blum came back into power. In response to the recent Anschluss, Blum was committed to national defense and wanted to boost armaments production. In the last week of March there were strikes in a number of aviation and metalworking factories in the Paris region. The CGT leaders had accepted a shift system but were willing to work longer hours in the aviation industry as long as they earned overtime pay for anything over 40 hours per week. Forgeot wanted to keep the single-shift system, but with a 48-hour week. Eventually a compromise agreement was reached on 12 April 1938 after Blum had been forced out of office. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Forgeot replaced Raoul Dautry as president of the Hispano-Suiza operating company when Dautry was named Minister of Armaments in September 1939. In January 1940 Forgeot met Henri Queuille on 5 January 1940 and expressed optimism about the superiority of the French fighter aircraft and the new turbo-charged engines. After the German invasion of France Forgeot was directed on 10 September 1940 to continue the Hispano-Suiza operations in the occupied zone. He replied that he had refused and continued to refuse to make war materials ‚Äì airplane engines, cannons and munitions ‚Äì for the German authorities. He proposed to turn over the factories to the French state, at no charge, and they could use them as they saw fit. In December 1940 Forgeot resigned from the presidency of the manufacturing company, but retained the presidency of the French holding company. Pierre Forgeot died on 30 June 1956 in Paris aged 68.

Ascyreia that is native to China and known as jian e jin si tao locally.  Taxonomy  The species was first collected in Yunnan, China, by George Forrest, who brought it back to England to be grown for botanical studying. This specimen became the type specimen under the number F.19448, but was incorrectly referred to as H. patulum var. henryi, and when cultivated as H. kouytchense or H. oblongifolium, both names of species with similar flower structures. The species was first formally described by Norman Robson in the J. Roy. Hort. Soc. 95:490 in 1970. = Clade 'Acmosepalum' = Dr. Robson placed two other species into an unofficial clade with H. acmosepalum because of their very close similarities to one another in both distribution and appearance. The two other species, Hypericum beanii and Hypericum pseudohenryi, and H. acmosepalum therefore form the unofficial clade 'Acmosepalum' within section Ascyreia. This clade seems to be directly related to H. siamense. Description From N. Robson's original description of the species: > Shrub 0-6-2 m tall, with branches erect to ascending. Stems orange, 4-angled > and ancipitous in first year (or longer), then terete; internodes 10-50 mm > long, shorter than to exceeding leaves; bark grey-brown. Leaves broadly > petiolate, with petiole 0.5-1(1.5) mm, long; lamina 18-42(-60) x 6-15(-20) > mm, oblong or elliptic-oblong to narrowly elliptic (sometimes lanceolate > towards apex ef shoot and oblanceolate towards base), obtuse (rarely > subacute) or apiculate to rounded, margin plane, ¬± recurved, base cuneate, > markedly paler to glaucous beneath, chartaceous to subcoriaceous; venation: > 1-2 pairs main laterals (the upper forming distinct, often ¬± straight > intramarginal vein), with midrib rather obscurely branched distally, with > rather dense but very obscure or invisible tertiary reticulum; laminar > glands ¬± small dots and sometimes short streaks, ventral glands sparse to > rather dense. Inflorescence l-3(-6)-flowered, from apical node, > subcorymbiform; pedicels 7-17 mm long; bracts foliar to lanceolate, > persistent. Flowers 30-50 mm in diam., stellate; buds ovoid, acute to > subapiculate. Sepals (5-)6-9(-11) x 3-4(-6) mm, free, imbricate, subequal, ¬± > outcurved in bud and fruit, ovate to narrowly lanceolate, acute or > acuminate, with margin subentire or minutely and ¬± irregularly denticulate > (especially towards apex); midrib ¬± conspicuous, veins not prominent; > laminar glands linear or interrupted, c. 8. Petals deep yellow, sometimes > tinged red, spreading or reflexed, 16-25 x 10-15 mm, 2.5-3 x sepals, > obovate, with apiculus lateral, subacute to obtuse, margin entire or often > minutely glandular-denticulate especially around apiculus. Stamen fascicles > each with 40-65 stamens, longest (10)15-18 mm, long, 0.75-0.85 x petals; > anthers yellow to orange-yellow. Ovary 5-7 x 3.5-4.5 mm, ¬± narrowly ovoid- > conic; styles (3-)4-6(-8) mm, long, equalling to slightly longer than ovary, > free, suberect, outcurved near apex; stigmas truncate to narrowly > subcapitate. Capsule 9-15 x 8-10 mm, ovoid to narrowly ovoid-conic, turning > bright red during maturation. Seeds dark orange-brown to reddish-brown, 1-1.1 mm long, narrowly cylindric, narrowly carinate with terminal expansion, shallowly linear-foveolate. Seed dry mass is 0.05mg Its usually oblong or elliptic, apically ¬± rounded leaves, glaucous abaxially and with a conspicuous intramarginal vein, enable Hypericum acmosepalum to be recognized even when sterile. It can be differentiated from H. kouytchense specifically by the deeper yellow of the petals, the petal apiculus which is not as sharp, and the fact that it grows taller than that species.  Distribution and habitat  The species' range includes the Chinese autonomous region of Guangxi and the Chinese provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan. The species is most often found in forest glades, roadside banks, scrubby hillsides, and open stream sides at elevations of above sea level.  Uses  Hypericum acmosepalum extract has been found to contain hyperenone A and hypercalin B, two newly discovered chemotypes that expressed antibacterial activity against drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Hyperenone A also exhibited growth-inhibitory activity against several species of Mycobacterium, which suggests the plant's extracts could have extensive antibacterial properties.

He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before commissioning into the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers in 1926. He initially served in India and was promoted to lieutenant in 1929. In 1933 he returned to the United Kingdom and served as Adjutant of his regiment between 1933 and 1935. He retired from the army with the rank of captain in 1937. On 28 April 1938, he was elected unopposed to the London County Council to fill a casual vacancy. He sat as a Municipal Reform Party councillor representing Lewisham West and held the seat until elections were resumed after the Second World War in 1946. Hardy- Roberts' commission was reactivated in 1939 following the outbreak of war. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1941 and that same year was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He saw active service in the Western Desert Campaign and the Italian Campaign, before working as Chief of Staff to General Sir Miles Dempsey between 1943 and 1945. In 1944, Hardy- Roberts was appointed a CBE and mentioned in dispatches while serving in the North-West Europe Campaign of 1944‚Äì1945, and he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1945.

Founded in 1901, it was the first racecourse in the country and one of the oldest golf courses. Originally serving Western expatriates and Thai aristocrats, the club was at the centre of development in the introduction of modern sport to the country during the early 20th century. The club has since maintained its exclusivity, and has a reputation as a domain of high society.  History  The RBSC's history dates to 1890, when English expatriate Franklin Hurst made a request to Prince Devawongse Varoprakar, the Foreign Minister, for permission to establish a club, with a racecourse and sports field, in Bangkok. Permission was granted in 1892, along with a lease of land in the Sa Pathum area (now Pathum Wan District) from the government. The original club, known as the Bangkok Gymkhana Club, remained operational for less than a decade. In 1901, a group of expatriates and high-ranking Thais, led by Russian Consul-General Alexander Olarovsky, submitted a request to establish a new club, \\"for the purpose of improving the standard of horse breeding and various other field sports.\\" Royal assent was granted by King Chulalongkorn, and the Royal Bangkok Sports Club was established by royal charter on 6 September 1901. It took over assets of the Gymkhana Club and secured use of the racecourse land. Olarovsky became the club's first chairman. Horse racing began at the club in January 1903. Other sports were gradually introduced, including cricket in 1905, golf (the second oldest course in Thailand) in 1906, rugby in 1907 and squash in 1909. The RBSC served as a central venue where the Thai elite adopted modern, Western sports, building an image of Thais as a civilized people as part of the country's modernization under Chulalongkorn's reign. The clubhouse in around 1910 In 1911, the club served as the site of an aviation meet, where Belgian aviator Charles Van den Born made the first demonstration of an aeroplane flight in Siam (as Thailand was then known). From 1913 to 1914 part of the club's grounds served as the country's first airfield, known as Sa Pathum Airfield. It was used by the country's first Army pilots, before permanent facilities were established at Don Mueang Airport. In 1916, as a result of a dispute over funding being diverted to other sports at the expense of horse racing prize money, a group of Thai members split off from the RBSC to form the Royal Turf Club of Thailand. The new club largely catered to Thai members, while the RBSC continued to remain very Western-oriented, leading them to become known as Sanam Thai (the \\"Thai racecourse\\") and Sanam Farang (\\"Farang racecourse\\"). The RBSC continued to be chaired by Western expatriates until 1941, when the Japanese Army occupied the club in the course of World War II and Prince Rajadabhisek Sonakul became the first Thai chairman. The club continued to grow over the years, adding new facilities and introducing new sports. Its clubhouse was first rebuilt in 1912‚Äì1915. An Olympic-sized swimming pool, the first in the country, was opened in 1933. A sports pavilion was added in 1977, and a new multi-purpose building, named the Rajkreetha Sports Complex, was opened in 2005. In 1978, the RBSC took over the Bangkok Riding and Polo Club (situated 1.5 km away on Witthayu Road), which was having financial difficulties. It became the RBSC Polo Club, and operates as a subsidiary of the RBSC, although the memberships are kept separate.  Location and facilities  The RBSC's grandstand is the only area open to the public The RBSC occupies of land on Henri Dunant Road, opposite Chulalongkorn University. (The road was previously known as Thanon Sanam Ma (, \\"Racecourse Road\\") after the club.) It is surrounded on other sides by the Royal Thai Police Headquarters, Ratchadamri Road and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital/Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine. Its location is among the city centre's prime real estate, and has been estimated to be worth around 100 billion baht (US$3 billion). RBSC members have access to facilities for badminton, basketball, billiards, bridge, chess, cricket, field hockey, football (soccer), golf (an 18-hole course and a driving range), jogging, lawn bowls, martial arts, physical fitness, qi gong, rugby, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis and yoga. It also has a dining room, multiple bars, and banquet facilities. The fortnightly horse races are the only occasion where the RBSC is accessible to the public, and serve as its main source of income. Races are held every other Sunday, from about noon to 18:00. The club holds three major events annually: the King's Cup in February, the Chakri Cup in April, and the Queen's Cup in August.  Membership  A race at the RBSC The RBSC is among the most exclusive clubs in Thailand, and is highly selective of its members. Descriptions of the application process in 1990 include being proposed and seconded by existing members, going through a vetting process, and after sitting through a waiting list of up to a decade, being interviewed by the General Committee (the club's executive board), who must give unanimous approval for the application to be successful. New members are also required to pay an entrance fee, reportedly up to 2 million baht ($65,000) in 2011. Children of current members, however, are entitled to membership once they turn 21 years old. The number of members is limited at 12,500 accounts.RBSC Magazine, Vol.7 No.73 July 2007, p. 35 Polo Club membership, which is less exclusive, has served to help absorb the excess potential members. (RBSC members may use the Polo Club's facilities, while the reverse is not true.) The club, once described in a golf guidebook as \\"one of Asia's remnants of the great age of Imperialism\\", Cited in Cohen 1995. is also very conservative in its values, derived from its gentlemen's club origins. Female members do not have voting rights, and although its membership is now mostly Thai (87% in 1990), proposals to amend the club's articles of association to allow more than half of the General Committee seats to be held by Thais have repeatedly failed, as have suggestions that memberships be made transferable.

It debuted on Chicago's WGN in 1930, then moved to the NBC radio network Blue Network on April 6, 1931. It aired until April 26, 1942. Together with Skippy (1932‚Äì1935) it is seen as the oldest US children's radio program. Radio historian Jim Harmon attributes the show's popularity in The Great Radio Heroes to the fact that it was the only radio show to deal with and appeal to young children. Concept Ovaltine cup manufactured exclusively for the Wander Company, makers of Ovaltine. \\"Little Orphan Annie\\" was based on Harold Gray's eponymous and equally popular comic strip series Little Orphan Annie. The show debuted on WGN/Chicago in 1930, but only became a national hit when it moved to NBC radio's Blue Network in 1931. It was broadcast in the late afternoon and ran for twelve successful years. In 1931, when the show debuted, radio had yet to establish coast-to-coast networks so two separate casts performed‚Äîone in San Francisco starring Floy Margaret Hughes and the other in Chicago starring Shirley Bell as Annie, Stanley Andrews as \\"Daddy\\", and Allan Baruck (and later Mel Torm√©) as Joe Corntassel. When coast to coast networking was established in 1933, the Chicago cast became the permanent one. Merchandising The show was initially sponsored by Ovaltine, a flavored milk supplement, and its scripts were written by Ovaltine's Chicago ad agency staff. They shunned the overt political themes of Gray's newspaper strips and concentrated instead on pitching Ovaltine, using almost seven minutes of each broadcast to do so. Fans could redeem Ovaltine proofs of purchase for a secret decoder badge that decoded brief messages airing in the last moments of the show. Contrary to Jean Shepherd's assertions, the messages were never advertisements for Ovaltine, but were usually related to the following episode. In 1940, Quaker Puffed Wheat Sparkies became the show's sponsor and brought fictional aviator Captain Sparks to the show. Sparks eventually became the star, relegating Annie to secondary player. The product placement and exploitation of premiums to retain and attract new listeners was notable. Among those items were secret decoders, shake-up mugs for drinking Ovaltine (the show's sponsor product) and secret decoder rings for the Little Orphan Annie secret society.CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT AND DECODER RINGS, Stephen A. Kallis, Jr. The 1934 fan club's member's handbook included a simple substitution cipher with a resulting numeric cipher text. This was followed the next year with a membership badge or pin that included a cipher disk - enciphering the letters A-Z to numbers 1-26. Announcer Pierre Andre often talked about the virtues of the shows' products, sometimes stretching towards three minutes in length. Cast * Annie - Shirley Bell Cole (Bobbe Deane briefly played the part between 1934 and 1935 during a contract dispute involving Shirley Bell. Between 1940 and 1942 Janice Gilbert performed the role.) * Mr. Silo - Jerry O'Mera * Mrs. Silo - Henriette Tedro * Joe Corntassel - Allan Baruck (later Mel Torm√©) * Oliver \\"Daddy\\" Warbucks - Henry Saxe, Boris Aplon, Stanley Andrews * Punjab - Quentin Young * Sandy the dog - Brad Barker Theme song The theme song was sung by announcer Pierre Andre, as \\"Uncle Andy\\". Leonard Salvo was the show's organist. Who's that little chatter box? The one with pretty auburn locks? Whom do you see? It's Little Orphan Annie. She and Sandy make a pair, They never seem to have a care! Cute little she, This Little Orphan Annie. Bright eyes cheeks a rosy glow, There's a store of healthiness handy. Mite-size, always on the go, If you want to know - \\"Arf\\", says Sandy. Always wears a sunny smile, Now, wouldn't it be worth the while, If you could be, Like Little Orphan Annie? In popular culture Jean Shepherd used the show as the basis for his short story \\"The Counterfeit Secret Circle Member Gets the Message, or The Asp Strikes Again.\\" In the story, first-person narrator Ralphie Parker is an avid listener of the program and eagerly awaits the arrival of his decoder ring to find out the secret messages in each episode. When the ring arrives, he anxiously decodes the secret message in that day's episode, only to be disappointed when the resulting secret message was an Ovaltine commercial. The short story was included in Shepherd's compilation book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, and the story was also included as one of the scenes in Shepherd's 1983 film A Christmas Story. Legacy As with most daily radio serials, very few recordings of the series' thousands of episodes survive. The Internet Archive has 38 15-minute recordings in its Old-Time Radio collection. In 1990 the show was inducted in the National Radio Hall of Fame. In 1995, Shirley Bell Cole was heard in a reenactment of Little Orphan Annie on Chuck Schaden's Those Were the Days radio show.

Personal life Blair was born in Richmond, Virginia on June 21, 1834 to John Geddes Blair and Sara Ann Eyre Heron Blair. He had some formal schooling, but received most of his education through reading. During the Civil War Blair fought with the Confederate States Army with the Company A, 13th Battalion Virginia Light Artillery, where he was known for \\"challenging authority, engaging in fistfights, and spending time in stockade confinement\\". Blair would later consider his time spent with the Confederate army a waste, as he considered slavery a \\"most monstrous institution\\". Blair was married twice. He married his first wife, Alice Wayles Harrison, in 1867 and the two had seven children together. Harrison memoirs indicate that Blair and his wife took Alice's mother Lucy Harrison into their home and cared for her during her long final illness until she died there in 1881.[Memoirs of Rev. Harrison's granddaughter.] Alice herself died in 1894. Blair married again in 1898 to Martha Ruffin Feild, with whom he had four daughters. He died on November 26, 1916 in Richmond of a heart attack and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery. Business opinions and career Blair ran a wholesale auction business after returning from the Civil War and later ran a retail store, as well as a wholesale grocery business. His business ventures were extremely successful and Blair became very wealthy. He would frequently write to newspapers to criticize the concept of the New South, saying that it was something that was made up by people like Henry W. Grady. He argued that most of the South lived in abject poverty and that it was little better than it was prior in 1860. In one instance Blair allegedly demonstrated a callous approach in his business affairs. He had made a loan to his brother-in-law, Rev. John Hartwell Harrison in Amelia County to enable payment of the taxes owed on his home; Harrison gave Blair title to the home to secure the debt. According to Harrison family memoirs, in 1896 the loan went into default in the third year of the depression. Blair sold the Harrison farm property, and the brother and sister-in-law of his deceased wife Alice, as well as her nephews, aged 17, 15, 9 and 7, were obliged to move from their home, after recently putting in their crops.[Memoirs of Rev. Harrison's granddaughter.] Views on race In his 1889 book The Prosperity of the South Dependent upon the Elevation of the Negro Blair called for greater equality, equal rights, voting rights, and better education for African Americans - even endorsing integration. He argued that trying to repress them would only bring the South down and was a waste of energy. Historian Fred C. Hobson later commented in his research that while Blair's opinions were similar to those of George Washington Cable, he was able to voice them without receiving as much criticism as Cable. Hobson credits this to Blair living further North than Cable (who lived in New Orleans) and because Blair was wealthy and came from a prominent family. Later in life Blair rejected his earlier opinions, stating in an unpublished manuscript that he believed African Americans to be inferior to whites, called for the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to be repealed, and also argued for disenfranchisement and segregation. His change in stance has been compared to Thomas E. Watson.

It was built from 1872 to 1980s. It is also known as Colonial Sugar Refining Company Refinery of Yarraville. It was added to the Victorian Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.Sugar Australia, 2004, Refineries  History  The CSR Refinery at Yarraville was erected by the Colonial Sugar Refinery Company in 1872. Founded in Sydney in 1855, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (now CSR Limited) has come to dominate the Australian and South Pacific sugar industry. Attempts at growing sugar cane had been made in Queensland prior to separation of the colony, however it was Captain Louis Hope's success in the 1860s which saw government encouragement of the growing of sugar cane in the colony. Plantations developed in the Cleveland, Beenleigh, and Caboolture districts and new areas along the coast quickly opened up including by the 1870s in the Maryborough, Bundaberg, and Mackay districts with sugar refining beginning on a small scale with the opening of the Yengarie sugar mill near Maryborough in 1873 and later the Millaquin refinery at Bundaberg in 1882. By 1874, Queensland was exporting sugar to other Australian colonies. By the 1880s sugar was being grown further north in the Burdekin River, Herbert River, and Cairns districts. Moreover, encouraged by Queensland Premier Thomas McIlwraith, southern capital and advanced technology was beginning to reach northern plantations. The most important of these southern companies was the Colonial Sugar Refining Company who acquired large tracts of land for the cultivation of sugar in the Mackay district and established 3 large mills in North Queensland. To serve the growing Australian cities, CSR erected a chain of refineries around Australia's capital cities by the late 19th century, with Melbourne (Yarraville; purchased ), Sydney (Pyrmont 1878 which became the largest in Australia), Adelaide (Glanville 1891), and Brisbane. The Perth refinery was added in 1930. These dispersed plants were necessary because the refined product would otherwise be contaminated by sea voyages if distributed from the growing areas. CSR's monopoly was defended through the imposition of prohibitive intercolonial import duties on sugar products (in particular increases in taxes on syrup and molasses in the late nineteenth century) which would otherwise have had substantially compromised CSR's share in the golden syrup market in Queensland. The establishment of a local refinery enabled the company to compete in the protected refined sugar markets. Technological advances in the refining process in the mid nineteenth century transformed sugar from a luxury item to a staple food and saw a corresponding dramatic increase in the consumption of sugar in western countries. the Colonial Sugar Refinery company established a number of works around Australia and NEw Zealand, of which the Melbourne site was the first to be developed on the already established Joshua Brothers Company refinery of 1873, which was constructed to compete with the rival Victoria Sugar Company, a sub-company of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The Victorian Sugar Company Refinery (built c. 1857) burnt down in 1875, so CSR took over the Joshua Bros. Yarraville site. CSR established a sugar refining monopoly in the South Pacific, which continued into the 20th century.Maribyrnong Heritage Review - Industrial Places Description The CSR Sugar Refinery Complex comprises buildings dating from three main periods: 1870s, 1900s and 1910s. The original five storey bluestone and brick pan house and brick stores face the sugar wharf on the Maribyrnong River. The former Packing Station, (now drier station) was constructed c.1913, while the Cistern House and Char Ends construction from the 1870s to the 1930s employ a proprietary prefabricated iron or steel frame The Pan House formed the original refinery building and was constructed to a design of Thomas Watt in 1872-73. Other structures include the Retail Packing Station; c.1880 with its distinctive timber framed structural system; the former Melting House, 1902 which has a prefabricated cast iron internal frame; the Golden Syrup and Treacle Packing Store, 1880s with cast iron columns and timber beams, which housed a CSR designed Golden Syrup filling machine; and the Power House with gas engines and generators.ABLative No.6, Spring 1987, pp 3-4 'Head Office, Branch Office and Factory: Sydney, Melbourne and Yarraville.

It is located on the museum's 4th floor overlooking Wellington harbour, and was officially opened on 30 November 1997. The design, described as \\"postmodern\\", was overseen by Te Papa's inaugural kaihautu (MƒÅori leader), master carver Cliff Whiting. As \\"the only one of its kind expressly built for that purpose in a museum\\", this marae is \\"arguably the most prominent embodiment of [Te Papa's] commitment to biculturalism\\". In October 2020, the Government committed $887,291 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae and 4 others in the Central Hawke's Bay area, creating 12 jobs.  Purpose and usage  P≈çwhiri [welcoming ceremony] for the repatriation of 17 MƒÅori and Moriori ancestral remains at Rongomaraeroa (2018) Rongomaraeroa is used for many events, not only as a museum exhibit ‚Äì it was always intended to be a \\"'living marae' used for p≈çwhiri, functions, and tangi\\". For example, in May 2017 and July 2018 the marae was the site of ceremonies of repatriation of MƒÅori and Moriori remains ‚Äì including toi moko ‚Äì from several European and American institutions. Rongomaraeroa is unique in its ability to serve as the location for such ceremonies as it is a \\"nationalised, pan-iwi marae\\". As traditional gathering spaces, marae are always located on the ground. However, given the situation of this one on an upper level of the building, Whiting nicknamed Rongomaraeroa \\"the marae in the sky\\". The name also helped to differentiate it as a marae belonging to the museum \\"with its own special Te Papa kawa [protocols]\\", and not to Te ƒÄti Awa ‚Äì the local iwi [tribe] of the Wellington area. Although initially controversial and charged with being a \\"reappropriation\\" of complex MƒÅori practices and protocols \\"...to serve its reconciliatory, bicultural remit, often at the expense of more contested issues such as MƒÅori self-determination...\\", it is now widely accepted as a genuine marae, \\"by intention if not by inheritance\\". Rongomaraeroa is also available for hire from Te Papa for commercial and private events. Te Hono ki Hawaiki is not to be confused with the traditional wharenui of the Rongowhakaata iwi: Te Hau ki T≈´ranga. Dating from the 1840s, this is the oldest extant carved meeting house and is on long-term loan to Te Papa. It is displayed in the nearby exhibition of MƒÅori culture Mana Whenua.  Design  Rongomaraeroa has a usable space of 350m¬≤ and can accommodate 250 people. Carvings for the wharenui were made by Whiting using the non-traditional material medium-density fibreboard (MDF) rather than rare native timber. This enabled the forming of unusual and elaborate three-dimensional shapes. Non- traditional colours as well as European, Asian, and Polynesian design references were incorporated in order to include all cultures of contemporary New Zealand. \\"It reflects the nation's bicultural foundations while embracing everyone. It's innovative in its story-telling and its design...[Cliff] extended the boundaries of MƒÅori art by using contemporary materials and resources\\" stated his successor Arapata Hakiwai in 2013. For example, the wharenui includes a triptych shrine featuring a Christian dove, \\"in order to come up with something that not only MƒÅori could relate to but Europeans as well.\\" Carvings in arches and pillars of Te Hono ki Hawaiki representing MƒÅori myths and legends include: * The story of MƒÅui slowing the sun depicted on the maihi [arms] of the wharenui. * The story of the creation of the first woman, Hineahuone, by her father TƒÅne Mahuta the god of the forest, represented in the doorway. * MƒÅui turning his brother-in-law, Irawaru, into a dog. * The story of Paikea the whale rider. * And \\"the changing relationship between MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ [European New Zealanders] is portrayed inside the cupboards housed in the poutokomanawa (the central heart post of the meeting house)\\".

As an engineer for the (), he was the creator of a great deal of the region's civil infrastructure, such as the Canal du Centre between Digoin and Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne (1784‚Äì1793), bridges including those at Navilly (1782‚Äì1790) and Gueugnon (1784‚Äì1787), and buildings such as the (\\"Church of St Peter and St Paul\\") at Givry (Sa√¥ne-et-Loire) (1772 ‚Äì 1791) and the theatre at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne. Gauthey became Chief Engineer of the √âtats de Bourgogne in 1782, on the death of his predecessor and close collaborator, Thomas Dumorey. After the French Revolution, he held several important posts in the (\\"High Commission for Bridges and [High]ways\\") in Paris. He was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur in 1804 on its creation by Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1805 until his death, he was the highest-ranked engineer in France. Biography √âmiland Marie Gauthey was born at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne on 3 December 1732 into a provincial petty bourgeois family. His father, Pierre Gauthey, was the local doctor: and his mother, Louise (or Louyse) n√©e was born at Chagny on 27 August 1700 as the dauter of Emiland Lafouge, a company lawyer and Official Receiver for the salt store in Toulon-sur-Arroux. From 1740 to 1748, he studied with brilliance at the Jesuit college in Chalon. At the age of sixteen, after his father died, he continued his studies at Versailles under the auspices of an uncle who was Professor of Mathematics at the √âcole des pages du roi (). He continued his education under the architect Gabriel Dumont before entering the (which became the √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es, literally \\"National School of Bridges and [High]Ways\\"), which had been newly created and was under the direction of the notable engineer Jean- Rodolphe Perronet. He met with the Dumont architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot, and started a lifelong friendship. He consulted Soufflot on the construction of the dome of Sainte-Genevi√®ve, which became the Panth√©on. Graduating in 1758, he was awarded the post of deputy engineer at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, under Thomas Dumorey. He would wait twenty-four years, until Dumorey's death in 1782, to become the Chief Engineer of the √âtats de Bourgogne (States of Burgundy) and to makeDijon his home. Shortly after, he was named Director.General of Burgundy Canals () in 1783. A brilliant technician, he was an exponent of the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment and of the Encyclop√©die ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers (\\"Encyclopaedia or Rational Dictionary of Sciences, Arts and Crafts\\"), as evidenced by his investigative Essay on Philosophical Language () of 1774 ‚Äì in which he envisages a kind of language of universal graphical signs like stenography ‚Äì; and in his use of scientific advances in the building trade. His monumental works on building, (\\"On the application of mechanical principles in the construction of vaults and domes\\") and (\\"On Navigation Canals\\") posthumously published by his nephew, became standard reference works. His civil engineering works, such as the bridges of Gueugnon, Navilly and Chalon-sur- Sa√¥ne, helped to transform transportation methods and accelerated the Industrial Revolution in 19th-century Burgundy. It was in this forward-looking spirit that he participated in improving river navigation and building canals. He collaborated in the project to build a canal in Burgundy between the River Yonne and River Sa√¥ne (completed much later, in 1832) and he puis se consacre au canal de Franche-Comt√© de Saint-Jean-de-Losne/Saint-Symphorien-sur-Sa√¥ne √† Dole (also known as the ): this part of the project to connect the River Rhine with the River Rh√¥ne, built between 1783 and 1803, is also known as the because it was opened by Louis V Joseph de Bourbon-Cond√©, lately Prince and Governor of Burgundy. But his master work, \\"The greatest public work of the 18th Century\\", was the Canal du Centre (or \\"Canal du Charolais\\"), (built 1783‚Äì1793) between Digoin and Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne. Over with 62 locks, it connected the River Loire to the River Sa√¥ne, thus creating the primary route for boats from the English Channel to the Mediterranean Sea (the River Loire having been connected to the River Seine by the Canal de Briare). Gauthey remained interested in development in Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, his home town, where he rebuilt the quayside and built a theatre. These constructions are among many examples of neoclassical style in the area, including the dome of the pharmacy in the town, the churches at Givry and Louhans, the town hall at Tournus and the Ch√¢teau de Clermont-Montoison at Chagny. Changes after the French Revolution brought √âmiland Gauthey honours and high office: he was named the first in 1791. At the age of 60 he moved to Paris, married his cousin and adopted his nephew Claude-Louis Navier, one of the most brilliant mathematicians and engineers of the early 19th century. in 1801 he became a member of the Conseil g√©n√©ral des ponts et chauss√©es en 1801 and in 1805 its vice-president. He worked on Somme-Escaut link and several developments in Paris, such as a new water supply which would become the Canal de l'Ourcq), and projects on the Seine bridges and the Passerelle des Arts, built by Jacques Dillon. The French Consulate awarded him the civil L√©gion d'honneur on its first issue on , and he was to be promoted to Commander but died suddenly, in Paris, on . Perhaps surprisingly, his place of death is unknown, but it is likely to be in a Parisian cemetery.

Created originally for the children of the Portuguese living in Angola, the Luanda Portuguese School has requested teachers from the Ministry of Education of Portugal and follows the programs and school calendar in force in Portugal. Considered to be the most prestigious non-university educational institution in Angola, the Portuguese School of Luanda has also opened its doors to Angolan students, particularly the children of Luanda's upper classes and leaders of the former Angolan independence movement. Built with a capacity of 1,500 students, Luanda's Portuguese School provides pre-school, primary, secondary and tertiary education levels (1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles). In the academic year 2007/2008 it had eighty-one teachers and one thousand two hundred and six students. In 2009 the number of students reached the threshold of 2000 and in 2010 the maximum capacity was exceeded with 600 students waiting for a place to enter. The Portuguese government has showed willingness to support the implementation of a second phase that would allow the increase of the capacity of the Portuguese School of Luanda to 3,000 students. However, to date this has not yet occurred.

It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a major strategic deception intended to misdirect and confuse German high command about Allied invasion plans during 1944. Ferdinand consisted of strategic and tactical deceptions intended to draw attention away from the Operation Dragoon landing areas in southern France by threatening an invasion of Genoa in Italy. Planned by Eugene Sweeney in June and July 1944 and operated until early September, it has been described as \\"quite the most successful of 'A' Force's strategic deceptions\\". It helped the Allies achieve complete tactical surprise in their landings and pinned down German troops in the Genoa region until late July. Background Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 the main thrust of deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion. The Allied nations invaded Italy in September 1943 and by mid-1944 had pushed the Germans back to the Gothic Line in the North of the country. Ferdinand was intended to develop a threat against Genoa, as part of an expected Allied assault on the Gothic Line in August/September 1944. German forces in the French Riviera (originally threatened by Vendetta) were to be put at relative ease, but not left feeling too secure lest they be moved to re-inforce Normandy. Planning for the operation was handled by 'A' Force; the department in charge of deception in the Middle East. A large part of the operation planning was handed to Major Eugene J Sweeney, an Irish-American career officer who had joined the department in late 1943 with the express task of learning the arts of deception before the war ended. Working out of Algiers, at Advanced HQ (West), Sweeney helped implement several deceptions. The most notable of these was Operation Oakfield, the cover plan for Operation Shingle and the Battle of Anzio. John Bevan, head of the London Controlling Section, met with Colonel Dudley Clarke (head of 'A' Force) in Algiers in early June to decide on the outline for Ferdinand. After four days he returned to London leaving 'A' Force to work on the draft. On 4 July the draft was approved by Field Marshall Henry Wilson, Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean theatre. In July, Seventh Army HQ (the army due to be used for Dragoon) moved from Algeria to Naples. Sweeney moved with them, as the head of the newly formed No. 2 Tac HQ, and tasked by Colonel Clarke to focus entirely on planning for Ferdinand. Sweeney worked on the plan until its final form on 28 July. Despite not being completed until the end of the month Ferdinand went into effect as soon as the first draft was approved. Operation Ferdinand was a complex plan, involving misinformation and extensive physical deception. The underlying plot was the Allied forces had been surprised to find the Germans had not moved forces from the Mediterranean to re-inforce Normandy. Therefore, plans to invade southern France and the Balkans were looking less appealing. Instead the Allied commanders had decided to focus all of their resources on the Italian campaign. The real force assigned to Dragoon, the US VI Corps, would land in Genoa. Meanwhile, notional formations, such as the Seventh Army and the British 5th Airborne Division would support pushes along the Italian front and threaten targets in the Balkans. Ferdinand also recycled some of Zeppelin's threats against Turkey with the fictional British Ninth and Twelfth Armies. The key to Ferdinand was the threat to Genoa. Intelligence intercepts showed that the Abwehr (German military intelligence) listed it as one of the main areas they expected an Allied attack. It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region, which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance. German commanders identified both Genoa and southern France as the only logical targets, so the task for Allied double agents was to convince them that the former was the true goal. The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself, with a tactical deception. The Dragoon fleet travelled on a course toward Genoa until late at night on 14 August, when they turned west toward their real target. The Ferdinand threat was continued until 8 September, to support the Allied efforts in France and Italy. It was 'A' Force's last major operation, a brief follow up called Braintree was designed but never implemented because the overall Bodyguard strategy had been mothballed in late August. Related operations At the same time as Ferdinand, Tac HQ ran Otterington. This deception built a threat against Rimini in the east of Italy, in support of Alexander's proposed assault on the centre of the Gothic Line. It developed a pincer movement, in tandem with Ferdinand's threat to the west. However, once Otterington had gotten underway, with a major buildup of dummy armour, Alexander changed his plans and decided to push against Rimini. Clarke hastily implemented Ulster, a double bluff in which Otterington was revealed as a sham in the hope it would distract attention from that sector. Impact Ferdinand successfully led Fremde Heere West (German military intelligence for the Western Front, also referred to as FHW) to expect a landing in Genoa. In late July and early August the buildup of forces in Italy made it clear that a seaborne invasion was imminent, and the deception was successful in creating this as a realistic threat to Genoa. As a result, the Dragoon landings achieved complete tactical surprise. In his history of British wartime intelligence, historian Michael Howard calls it the \\"most successful of 'A' Force's strategic operations\\". However, Howard states that the overwhelming force used for Operation Dragoon meant that the element of surprise was less important than on D-Day.

The name iCalamus derives from the software Calamus by the same manufacturer but neither offers document compatibility nor shares a single line of source code with the latter. (Calamus derives from the Latin name of a writing instrument made of reeds; see Kalamos.) In April 2018 iCalamus was acquired by Lemke Software, makers of GraphicConverter.  History  After invers Software had marketed and maintained the DTP software Calamus for various computer platforms since 1996, at latest in 2001, after the takeover of the Calamus program rights, the question came up whether Calamus should still be maintained as a native Atari application or better be ported to Windows or Mac OS. The port was too costly and lengthy to the developers. There was the idea of a whole new layout application natively to write in Objective-C for Mac OS X. The development of iCalamus 1.0 started in November 2003 and was completed with some delay in October 2006. iCalamus is often compared with InDesign, PageMaker and QuarkXPress in magazine reviews.Magazine 'Deutscher Drucker', issue 24/2008, pg. 16f, \\"Satz- und Layoutprogramme: Ersatz f√ºr Indesign und Xpress\\" Because of the similar name, it is often regarded as the new Calamus for Mac. In March 2018, invers Software announced the cessation of its business operations and hence the distribution and development of iCalamus. In May 2018 it was announced that the GraphicConverter manufacturer Lemke Software took over iCalamus. Since then, Lemke Software has been distributing iCalamus on its own - and will further develop the program.  Versions  Thanks to a special plug-in which handles print orders for photo books, calendars and other print products of the Photographerbook company, it is also possible to print photo books and calendars created in iPhoto with the free, unregistered version of iCalamus. Standard iCalamus documents can be created with some limitations in the unregistered version. The registered version's current price is 129 EUR. Being a Universal Binary, iCalamus 1 supported Mac OS X as of 10.4.5. Version 2 was released at the end of 2013, requires (since v2.14) OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and is a 64 bit application. The software offers eleven languages: Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Spanish, Swedish. There is still no option to load Calamus SL documents directly into iCalamus.  Features  iCalamus can take whole web pages as PDF screen shots into documents. Using grouped shape frames, images can be masked in real-time. Like his namesake Calamus, iCalamus supports real virtual copies of frames, where there is no mother-child relation; all virtual frames change at the same time. All layout elements can be adjusted infinitely transparent. For creating masks and textflow polygons, a Tracer engine is integrated. iCalamus supports all PDF blend modes. The print output does not convert or touch ICC profiles of imported images. iCalamus is the first DTP application to support the LinkBack protocol which allows to plug external applications like plug-ins or modules into the GUI of the software.

She was the first woman to publish a book of poetry in Honduras and she is now regarded as its premier female poet. Life Su√°rez was a Bohemian whom loved to frequent cafes. Since she was little she got used to getting whatever she wanted and doing whatever she felt like. It didn't bother her that she was the only woman who frequented the tobacco shop \\"Mam√° llaca\\" in the neighborhood La Ronda de Tegucigalpa. Truthfully Clementina's education was that of the people. Clementina was called the \\"New Woman\\" in Honduras. Su√°rez was born in Juticalpa in 1902 to Amelia Zelaya Bustillo and Luis Suarez. She attended public school until fifth grade. In 1923 her father died, and Su√°rez left her rural family home without financial support or the support of her mother. Her first destinations were towns where she had relatives who provided a place for her to stay. She lived and worked various jobs in Trujillo, La Ceiba, San Pedro, Tela, and finally Tegucigulpa, all while writing. She eventually moved in with Antonia Rosa, also a writer. They had two daughters together, however, never married. Shortly after the birth of her second daughter, the poet, now 27, left Rosa, and married Guillermo Bustillo Reina, but the marriage ended after less than a year. Then, in 1948, she married the prominent visual artist, Jose Mejia Vides. She worked as a waitress to feed herself and her two children, but she still wrote. She wore shorts and a bikini, celebrating her body not only in life but also in her poetry. She was seen as a free woman, independent and outspoken. Tegucigalpa was shocked because of her modern way of behaving and breaking established rules traditionally attached to \\"feminine\\" behaviour. She was also the first woman to publish a book in Honduras. In December 1991 delinquents were merciless to her. The poet Roberto Sosa did her final interview. Her first two published poems reflected her independent character. She walked the streets of the capital dressed as a bellboy to sell her work when she published six issues of a journal named Mujer (woman). In 1936-7 she was in Cuba seeing its resistance against fascism. This observation and the news of the Spanish Civil War is thought to have expanded Su√°rez's horizons. She founded the Gallery of Central American Art while in political exile in Mexico in the 1940s. In the 1950s she created an artist's gallery El Rancho del Artista in El Salvador which was open to the public as well as serving as a community.Introduction: Why Are There So Many Women Writers?, bookmaniac.org, Retrieved 26 October 2015 She returned to her home country in 1958.

Early life and career Fehmi Demir was born on 2 January 1957 in the Turkish town of Yeniceoba (ƒ∞ncov) in the district of Cihanbeyli, Konya Province. He was the eldest of 6 children. He was educated at the Yeniceoba town school and completed his middle and high school education in Cihanbeyli. He graduated from the Eski≈üehir Commercial Sciences Academy Faculty of Economics, which would later become the Anadolu University. During his student years, he was active in pro-Kurdish university and political societies, also taking up roles in the Eski≈üehir Halkevleri.http://www.hakpar.org.tr/root/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=813&Itemid;=124‚ü®=tr Political career During the 1990s, Demir was active in pro-Kurdish political parties in Turkey. He was a founding member of the People's Labour Party (HEP) and was part of the party council. He was also a founding member of the Democracy Party (DEP) and became the party's Vice General Secretary. He later became a founding member of the Democracy and Change Party (DDP) and was the General Secretary until the party was closed down. He was part of the founding members of the Peace and Democracy Party (DBP) and served as the General Secretary of the DBP until the founding of the Rights and Freedoms Party, in which he served as Deputy Leader until he was elected as its Leader. =Leader of the Rights and Freedoms Party= The HAK-PAR held its 6th Ordinary Grand Congress on 26 October 2014, where 278 delegates cast their votes for a new leader to succeed Kemal Burkay. Demir won 164 votes against his rival Bayram Bozyel's 114, though the election was annulled since less than 50% of the registered delegates participated. However, after Bozyel withdrew from the race, Demir was automatically declared the leader. As leader, Fehmi Demir led the HAK-PAR into a general election for the first time since the party was founded, contesting the June 2015 general election in 78 provinces. The party won just under 60,000 votes, well below the 10% election threshold necessary to win seats in Parliament. At the time of Demir's death, the party was campaigning for its second general election, due to be held on 1 November. Death On 25 October 2015, Demir suffered a traffic accident on a motorway in Tarsus, Mersin Province, after his vehicle crashed into another car with an Austrian license plate that had broken down. Both Demir and Hacƒ± Murat Doƒüu, the driver of the Austrian vehicle, were critically injured and later died at the scene. They were transferred to Tarsus State Hospital after the crash.http://www.mustilife.com/guncel/hak-par-genel-baskani-fehmi-demir- hayatini-kaybetti-oldu-fehmi-demir-kimdir-26102015-h4273.html His funeral took place in his hometown of Cihanbeyli, Konya Province and was attended by many pro-Kurdish political leaders including the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) co-leader Selahattin Demirta≈ü.

She was Kuwait's first female to serve as an editor of a publication. She was a feminist and secularist, and she campaigned against corruption and on behalf of women's rights and suffrage in Kuwait. She was the first journalist to be killed in Kuwait since the Committee to Protect Journalists began recording these acts in 1992.  Personal  Hidaya Sultan al-Salem was born in Shuwaikh, Kuwait, to the ruling family. As a child, she attended the private Koranic girls' school of Mutawia Saleema and the Mutawia Mariam Al Askar until 1946. Her education came to an end when she was married at the age of fifteen. At the time of her husbands' death, she was a widow and a mother of four sons and one daughter.  Career  Hidaya Sultan al-Salem was a journalist and author, editor and publisher for 40 years. However, she began her career as a teacher. She was the sixth woman to ever become a teacher in Kuwait. While she was a teacher, she started writing articles for Lebanese and Egyptian newspapers. In 1961, she became a journalist in Kuwait. In 1964, she was a founding member of the Kuwaiti Literary League. She published five non-fiction books while working as a journalist. Two of the books were The Arabs (1965) and Women in Koran. In 1970, al-Salem bought the weekly magazine al-Majalis and became its publisher and editor-in-chief. She was also the owner of Arab Sport. In 1972, she became part of a second wave of Kuwaiti women writers when she published a short story \\"Kharif bila matar\\" (Translated: \\"An Autumn Without Rain\\"). In addition, she published an underground newsletter Children And Women of Kuwait during the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990-1991. She was also a member of the Kuwaiti Journalists Association and served on its board as a prominent woman.  Death  She was shot and killed in Kuwait City on 20 March 2001 while she was being driven to a Women and Culture Conference that was being hosted by the Kuwaiti Women's Association. The conference was being held to declare Kuwait City as the \\"capital of Arab culture\\" for a year. On the way, al-Salem was stopped at a traffic stop when Lieutenant Colonel Khaled Diab al-Azmi got out of his four-wheel drive vehicle and shot six bullets into al-Salem's head with a government-issued gun while she was in her Rolls Royce. The Lt. Colonel was a high ranking police officer, and he was wearing a long traditional robe at the time of the shooting. Investigation Hidaya Sultan al-Salem lived and worked in Kuwait City, Kuwait.Originally four people were investigated for the murder of Hidaya. Many motives for the murder were reviewed. At the beginning of the investigation, some believed the murder was political. Hidaya had written an article about money being embezzled, and the office in the Gulf Emirate not being used appropriately. Her lawyer believed it was too early to assume Hidaya was killed for political reasons. Another motive included financial problems and disputes with her employees. The investigation led to the actual motive for the crime. A year before the murder al-Salem had published an article, the article had criticized his Al- Awazem tribe. In the article al-Salem had published her thoughts about women dancers in the tribe.http://journalisten.no/story/22807 The dancers were women that al-Salem's family had hired. The article described the women dancers as 'all temptation and sexual suggestion'. Many members of the tribe took offense to this, due to the fact that al-Salem had talked about the tribe living outside the Kuwait walls. The members of the tribe believed al-Salem was implying that they were not real Kuwaiti people. Later, al-Salem explained that she did not mean that. The Lt. Colonel was thought to have killed al- Salem to protect the honor of his tribe. At first, the Lt. Colonel claimed innocence but later admitted that he was infuriated by the criticism of his tribe in her magazine. Later, the Lt. Colonel recanted his confession and suggested the police had forced the confession. In February 2002, Lt. Colonel Khaled al-Azmi was convicted by a criminal court for the murder of Hidaya Sultan al-Salem and sentenced to death by hanging, which was upheld on appeal. However, the sentence was later commuted to life by Kuwait's court of cassation. Lt. Colonel Al-Azmi was released in the second quarter of 2019 after 10,000,000.00 KD in blood money was paid to the victims' family.  Context  Even though the Constitution of Kuwait guaranteed women equality in 1961, women were not granted rights until 1999, which was opposed by the reactionary tribal-fundamentalist alliance. Hidaya Sultan al-Salem was a campaigner for women's rights and suffrage in Kuwait, as well as a female leader in publishing. Women media professionals surveyed by the Beirut-based Institute for Women‚Äôs Studies in the Arab World concurred that important editorial decisions in all media were still invariably made by men. While women were occupying more spots in journalism training programs, they were employed at the same level. She also played a role in the emergence of women in the literary scene in Kuwait in an era when magazine publishing was a new development. Impact While Hidaya Sultan al-Salem was the first journalist killed in Kuwait, she was one of 51 journalists killed while on the job in 2001. The rate of professionals in the media being attacked and killed increased during the year of 2001.  Reactions  Hidaya Sultan al-Salem wrote articles primarily about corruption in Kuwait. Kuwait News Agency reported 80 percent of her more recent articles before her murder was about corruption. The fundamentalist tribe alliance banned the publication of books written by two of her peers Aalia Shuaib and Laila al-Uthman.

Of disputed status, it is considered a distinct variety by some botanists, among them Henry (1913), Kr√ºssmann (1984),Kr√ºssman, Gerd, Manual of Cultivated Broad-Leaved Trees & Shrubs (1984 vol. 3) and Bean (1988),Bean, W. J., Trees and shrubs hardy in Great Britain, 8th edition (1988), Murray, London; p.643 and is sometimes cloned and planted as a cultivar. Henry said the tree \\"appears to be a common variety in the forests of central Europe\\", Bean noting that it \\"occurs in dry habitats\\". By the proposed rule that known or suspected clones of U. minor, once cultivated and named, should be treated as cultivars, the tree would be designated U. minor 'Suberosa'.Coleman M. (2002) 'British elms.' British Wildlife 13 (6): 390-395. The Sp√§th nursery of Berlin distributed an U. campestris suberosa alata Kirchn. [:'corky-winged'] from the 1890s to the 1930s. Green and Richens, however, dismissed var. suberosa as just a genetically random, maritime or juvenile form of U. minor, insufficiently differentiated to merit varietal status, its name a relic of taxonomic conservatism.Richens, R. H., Elm (Cambridge 1983), p.83, p. 278 Richens noted (1983) that some Soviet botanists still accorded the tree species status, as U. suberosa. Description Henry, having seen specimens in Slavonia, Croatia, and in Gisselfelde, Denmark, as well as at Kew, described the tree as having \\"branchlets of the second to the tenth year furnished with corky wings\\", but with \\"leaves and samarae as in the type\\". Kr√ºssman and Bean report it to be \\"rather dwarf\\" in comparison with most U. minor. The Kew specimens (see below) suggest that its slow growth is probably not related to dry habitat. Given the widespread occurrence of variable suberose Field Elm across Europe, it is likely that most photographs of Field Elm with corky flanges on branches do not show the cultivated dwarf variety. Young and semi-mature trees of some Ulmus √ó hollandica cultivars, notably 'Major', the 'Dutch Elm' of Britain and Australasia, also develop corky bark. Image:Ulmus minor 'Suberosa' (ex-Fa. C.

It has been classified as a Monument historique since 1921. History The H√¥tel de Hanau stands on a site originally owned by the rulers of Hanau-Lichtenberg, a county of the Holy Roman Empire. The current building, a typical h√¥tel particulier with a grand portal, a grand courtyard and two ornate fa√ßades, was commissioned by Johann Reinhard III, the last Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg, in 1728. It was constructed between 1731 and 1736 by Joseph Massol, who was also the executive architect of Palais Rohan at roughly the same time. It became state-owned (bien public) in 1790 in the wake of the French Revolution. Today the building is the H√¥tel de ville or city hall for the city of Strasbourg, a role it has had since 1805 and the first visit of Napoleon, who bestowed propriety of the h√¥tel to the city. It is now principally used for weddings, official receptions and banquets, whilst the administration of the city and the Strasbourg Eurom√©tropole is run from the centre administratif (also known as mairie) near Parc de l'√âtoile (built 1973-76).

The regular 120-gon has Dih120 dihedral symmetry, order 240, represented by 120 lines of reflection. Dih120 has 15 dihedral subgroups: (Dih60, Dih30, Dih15), (Dih40, Dih20, Dih10, Dih5), (Dih24, Dih12, Dih6, Dih3), and (Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, Dih1).

When Radio Atlanta was taken over by Radio Caroline in July 1964, Spence resigned and left the station. At some point that year he worked briefly as a DJ at Radio City, which broadcast from an old army fort at Shivering Sands in the Thames Estuary. A short time later he was as at Radio Invicta, a \\"sweet music station\\" which broadcast from a second world war fort at Red Sands, near Whitstable in Kent.Skues (2009) Pop Went the Pirates, p.21, p.98, p.111 Late in 1964 a demo tape won Spence a lunchtime spot on Radio London, which was due to begin broadcasting in December that year from the motor vessel MV Galaxy. Along with the other launch presenters he adopted a new on-air name, Dave Dennis. Among his early colleagues were Earl Richmond, Kenny Everett, Dave Cash, and senior DJ Tony Windsor, who had been with Spence at Radio Atlanta. Later arrivals included Tony Blackburn. The station was ground-breaking for UK pirate radio, in that unlike its major rival Radio Caroline it used a tight American top-40 format. \\"Caroline had always been what I call catch-as-catch-can radio,\\" said Dave Cash: \\"You used to go out there with a bunch of records and play them. No one had any idea what order they were in. No one had any idea of format at all.\\"http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/bigl1.htm After a shaky start, Spence became comfortable with the Radio London format and quickly established his lunchtime show as the most popular on the station, working live for three hours a day, often in rough seas where gramophone needles skipped across vinyl records, and with blankets to deaden the echo from the steel walls of the studio. His ratings could not be put down to formatting or music choice alone, as every DJ followed a similar tight format, based on the Dallas station KLIF. It was almost unheard of for a lunchtime radio show on any station to be a bigger draw than the breakfast show. An eventful two years saw Spence in his fast-talking persona of Dave Dennis keep his lunchtime show at the top of the station's ratings despite later competition from a wildly comedic teatime show presented by Kenny Everett and Dave Cash. In April 1966 Spence took his holiday in New York, where he was influenced by the high-pressure presentation style of DJs such as Bruce Morrow and Jack Spector, and the formatting skills of WABC's Rick Sklar and WMCA's Ruth Meyer with her team-radio approach to presentation known as the 'Good Guys.'Billboard, 14 May 1966, p.24Billboard, Letters, 23 October 1971 Spence quit Radio London in December 1966. His parting shot was a hit single which reached number 19 in the station's own chart, featuring his sickly-sweet reading to music of a Victorian newspaper editorial,http://www.newseum.org/exhibits/online/yes-virginia/ 'Yes, Virginia', reassuring a young girl that Santa Claus did indeed exist.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ndploWfH-c He went to live in Southern Ireland with Jo Spence, then a photographer's assistant and later a pioneering feminist photographer of the 1970s and eighties, who changed her name to his by deed poll.Jo Spence, 1986, Putting Myself in the Picture, p.90, p.217 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hsJTAAAAMAAJ Radio programming career Radio London closed down in 1967 with the introduction of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act in 1967, and BBC Radio 1 began broadcasting the same year. On his return to England, Spence began making jingles and trails for Radio 1, where many of his pirate radio contemporaries were forging on-air DJ careers. Kenny Everett in his first BBC broadcast in May 1967 jokingly named the Double-D as one of his \\"best friendships.\\"Skues (2009) Pop Went the Pirates, p.256-57 Spence later said he had worked for all four BBC Radio networks, including the classical station BBC Radio 3 and the speech based BBC Radio 4.Billboard, 30 April 1977, p.96 In 1970 he was appointed the first programme controller of the United Biscuits Network, UBN, a station which began broadcasting by landline to two of the UK factories of United Biscuits in September that year. The aim of the station was to keep workers entertained and productive, reducing staff turnover and absenteeism while providing safety and hygiene information. A year later UB chairman Hector Laing announced the station was achieving its objectives despite many doubters, and would expand to other factories. Spence told the Financial Times with some justification that the station's quality equaled BBC Radio 1 and was \\"a great sound.\\"'Tuning in to United Biscuits.' Financial Times [London] 7 Oct. 1971: 22. The Financial Times Historical Archive, 1888-2010. Accessed 27 Oct 2015 Spence developed a station which provided a top-40 format during the day, a middle- of-the-road MOR format in the evening, and a soul, blues and reggae format at night.Billboard, Letters, 23 October 1971 Spence also gained a reputation for talent spotting, and for developing the careers of DJs, who frequently moved on to regular broadcast stations. Among those whose early careers he helped to forge were Graham Dene, who he discovered in the BBC Gramophone Library, Adrian Love, and Roger Scott.http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html As Independent Local Radio (ILR) began to expand, many UBN presenters left to work at the new stations. In 1977 Spence himself moved to ILR, taking over as programme controller at Radio Trent from former UBN presenter Bob Snyder.Billboard, 30 April 1977, p.96 At Trent, Spence developed formats to appeal to a broad local audience, and continued to find and develop new talent. Among his hires there was Dale Winton, another DJ who had been at UBN.Dale Winton, 2012, My Story, p.146-47 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC Radio training career Spence's first training job was in the late 1960s at the \\"London Broadcasting School\\" run by his ex-colleague Earl Richmond. Among his first trainees was James Whale.http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html Spence developed a strong commitment to training and development during his years at UBN and Radio Trent, and that, together with his ability to talent spot, led Michael Bukht, then programme controller at Capital Radio, to ask him in 1980 to join the newly established National Broadcasting School as head of programming. From 1980 to 1985, Spence led intensive three-month courses to train music radio presenters. The school's aim was to develop talent for ILR, but many also went on to work for the BBC and in television as well as overseas, including in pirate radio. Alumni from his presentation courses included BBC presenter Jeremy Vine John Leech and the musician Mikey Dread. When the school closed in 1985, it appears Spence refused offers of work and was believed to have returned to farming. He resisted all invitations from former colleagues to attend reunions, particularly those from his pirate radio days. He died in Lincolnshire in 2007.http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html Presentation style When the founders of Radio Atlanta had discussed where to find suitable voices for a commercial station broadcasting to the UK, they concluded that no British broadcasters were capable of the task as they were so firmly rooted in the BBC style.http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/odds48.htm However, they took Spence on, together with a number of DJs well-versed in commercial broadcasting in Australia. Surviving recordings give a flavour of Spence's conventional and actorly British delivery. Although formal by comparison to US and Australian commercial stations, his style was far more relaxed than the BBC of the time.Neil Spence, Radio Atlanta, 1964 http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/audio/nspence.mp3 Moving to Radio Invicta, Spence maintained his actor-DJ style. However, by the time he arrived at Radio London in late 1966 his performance was still considered \\"stuffy\\" by senior DJ Tony Windsor and programme director Ben Toney.Dave Dennis, Radio London, 9 January 1965 http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/audio/bigl03.mp3 Windsor was tasked with turning Neil Spence the announcer and presenter into Dave Dennis the DJ, and was asked by Toney to \\"break in\\" Spence and \\"give him a few tips on how to present a proper deejay show.\\" Spence, who had grown up with little else to listen to except the BBC, responded poorly to Windsor's direction. \\"In the end I could tell he was about to drive Dave around the bend,\\" said Toney, who then asked Spence to use his acting training and in effect to create \\"Dave Dennis, the Double-D\\" as a character to be played on air. Toney was using off- air tapes of the Dallas top-40 station KLIF as a formatting aid for Radio London, and instructed Spence to listen to them carefully. \\"I then told him that if he were any kind of actor, he would be able to create the style of programming recorded on the tapes. As it turned out, Dave went from being a stuffy announcer to a top-notch deejay in a matter of weeks,\\" said Toney.Ben Toney, 2011, The Amazing Radio London Adventure http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl/bentoney/bookp3.html Toney later said that of all the DJs he encouraged towards the new style of British commercial broadcasting, Spence \\"made the greatest amount of progress of them all.\\" As new voices came on board, Spence the actor-DJ resolutely maintained the Dave Dennis character, catchphrases and all, in the face of a rising tide of ever more elaborate jokes aimed against him. His cabin mate Kenny Everett began the trend by making on-air references to his smelly feet and terrible temper.Stafford, David & Caroline Stafford (2013) Cupid Stunts https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Tn_AgAAQBAJ As the comedy became more sophisticated, Spence found himself on air with Everett having been invited to recite the weirdly obscure lyrics of the song 'Along Comes Mary' by The Association in his best actorly voice. After the words of the final chorus, \\"When we met I was sure out to lunch, Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch,\\" Everett announced: \\"That was 'Along Comes Mary,' ladies and gentlemen, as Dave Dennis crawls out of the studio on his knees.\\" Everett told his audience that Spence deserved an OBE for his performance.http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html Recordings of Spence's lunchtime programme as Dave DennisDave Dennis, Radio London, 14 March 1965 http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/audio/dennis1.mp3 show his own humour breaking through his former style, as he combines a rich British-accented voice with an irreverent approach which slyly and then more confidently sends up the BBC announcers of the day, with the speed of his delivery matching the rhythm of the music he plays and his theme tune 'Go Mean' by Ruffle. In April 1966 Spence spent his holiday from Radio London in New York, where his reputation gave him access top radio DJs and programmers.Billboard, 14 May 1966, p.4, p.24 On his return, his presentation style was even faster than before, as if to eliminate any possibility of dead air, and his microphone technique was adapted to cut through mush by making maximum use of the station's transmitter power.Dave Dennis, Radio London, June 1966 https://audioboom.com/boos/1099627-dave-dennis-neil-spence-radio-london- june-66 \\"DD's on-air style became machinegun-like with the volume at+3dB,\\" said fellow London Radio DJ Duncan Johnson. \\"I made a comment and he said the top man in New York says you have to push the compressor to hold the listener. I didn't bother to ask why.\\"http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/dennis.htm Spence's later on-air style remained contemporary and continued to hold the large audience he had built. \\"Dave Dennis swings,\\" said one of his jingles made by Kenny Everett. But photographs began to show his newer colleagues taking on the fashions of the Swinging Sixties, while Dave Dennis remained in the swing of an earlier era. After his departure from the station, Spence's Christmas single recorded under his own name made full use of his actor-DJ talents and his acerbic humour - any eight-year-old listening would genuinely believe there was a Santa Claus, while anyone older would hoot with laughter at the cloying sentimentality. Training and mentoring style The veteran radio presenter John Peters has described his own broadcasting style as bright, tight, brief and real.http://www.community- net.co.uk/members/aircheck/johnpeterstracker.htm Peters was trained and mentored by Spence at UBN, and these were precisely the qualities Spence emphasised to trainees from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. Spence's own presentation style when he left Radio London at the end of 1966 was far removed from the style he encouraged in later years as a radio executive and trainer. But despite his abandonment of what he later called the \\"disc jokey\\" style, his approach was entirely consistent in having respect for the audience. If the audience had moved on, then so should the presenters. As a trainer and mentor, Spence became a ferocious critic of the on-air performances of radio DJs. Dale Winton described him as \\"a very hard taskmaster who took no prisoners and could be terrifyingly blunt and honest if he didn't like your performance.\\" On listening to Winton's second show at Radio Trent, Spence \\"true to form, pulled my performance to pieces with all the skill of a friendly surgeon without the use of anaesthetic.\\"Dale Winton, 2012, My Story, p.146-47 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC Spence liked Winton enough to give him a regular afternoon show. If he didn't like a DJ, the words he used might be much the same, but the surgeon's delivery would be icily dismissive. However, most DJs with the talent on which to build a career came to respect and admire Spence, who despite an abrasive personality at times, could warm towards those in whom he saw significant potential.http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html Certainly he was keen to ensure that every presenter he trained and mentored produced their best possible performances on air. Given the qualities and immediacy of the medium, it was crucial for DJs to have the ability to recover from a mistake or a setback and continue to broadcast effectively and entertainingly, and Spence's withering critiques could be seen as essential to build on-air resilience. At UBN in the early 1970s he ran in effect a different radio station for each factory shift. A morning top-40 format gave way to an evening middle-of-the-road feel, and then a soul, blues and reggae station at night. \\"The whole station is run on tight commercial lines,\\" he told trade magazine Billboard, but added: \\"Unlike US Top 40 we allow much scope for a DJ's personality - and for factories in England this is just what is needed and indeed, required. This does not necessarily mean more rap [i.e. chat] - just better rap.\\"Billboard, Letters, 23 October 1971 At the National Broadcasting School, Spence distilled the lessons of his pirate days as well as his experience of UBN and Radio Trent. He brought on presenters suitable for ILR stations, which although they carried advertising, had a strong public service requirement as well as a commercial need to appeal to as many people in their local area as possible. At Radio London, Spence had been scrupulous in meeting and talking to his listeners, and listening to them in return, and he now instilled this approach into a new generation. He was disparaging about presenters from his pirate days who went into ILR without changing their style to reflect a different audience and different times, telling one trainee in the early 1980s that if she listened to his old Radio London colleague Dave Cash, at that time a presenter at ILR's Radio West, she would never find an audience.Dave Cash, 2012, He Sounds Much Taller - Part 1, Chapter 2 https://play.spotify.com/album/2vIDbwlKVDW4xx5W4p5SDh Any trainee who mentioned Spence's own pirate radio past was given a cold stare and a cold shoulder. He told a former Radio London colleague who invited him to a reunion that he refused to get involved in \\"this dated, rebarbative and otiose subject.\\"http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/dennis.htm The actor-DJ who had thrived on a comedic onslaught by Dave Cash and Kenny Everett was careful to tell trainees that the only result if they did this to their own colleagues would be to make the butt of their jokes more popular, and their own ratings slide. Spence took a high standard of technical competence as a basic requirement to present a tightly formatted show, and a bright personality was an absolute essential. But above all he insisted that presenters should be their authentic selves, despite his own success as a DJ having come from adopting an on-air persona. However, the personable Dave Dennis was still a recognisable part of Spence's often spikey off-air personality. His ferocious assessments of trainees' performance seemed designed to strip away any artifice or pretension, and force presenters to be genuine and real. Authenticity also meant they should use their own accent. Presenters who acquired a mid-Atlantic twang should be taken to the mid-Atlantic and left there. And he insisted DJs should be brief and to the point: \\"Just remember they want to hear the record. It's the people who made the record who have the real talent, not you.\\" Spence's critiques were always delivered while wearing his trademark dark suit and polished shoes, with every inch of his angular six foot two frame reinforcing that he was in charge. Spence played the part of programme controller with aplomb. He used the quintessential English upper- middle class accent that many successful actors adopted. His vocabulary was extensive to the point of baroque. His volume would rise and the speed increase as a trainee tried to get a word in edgeways, but in keeping with his ingrained professionalism, there was never a swearword, just in case somewhere a microphone was open. Influence and legacy During Spence's 1966 trip to New York, the editors of the trade magazine Billboard were interested not only in his ability to build and hold a large radio audience, but in his views on the regulatory environment and the likelihood of commercial radio being introduced in the UK.Billboard, 14 May 1966, p4, p.24 Spence was demonstrable proof to the US industry that British audiences wanted more than the BBC was prepared to offer, and that US top-40 format commercial radio could be adapted to attract large advertising spends while still being authentically British. He was not the only DJ broadcasting to the UK to develop the American top-40 format for a British audience, but he was the first to master it, and he took it further and faster than his contemporaries, making early pirate radio colleagues like Earl Richmond and Tony Windsor look stuffy in their turn. In doing so, he helped prove to the British government that British audiences had a thirst for something other than the staid BBC approach. In the event, in 1967 the British government introduced the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, and the BBC established its national pop music station Radio 1. Once commercial radio had been ruled out by the British government, interest in Spence in the US was nil.Billboard, 2 October 1971, p.28 Spence's legacy as what Dale Winton called \\"one of the best ever DJs on pirate radio\\"Dale Winton, 2012, My Story, p.146-47 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC could easily have been a host of imitators in the same Dave Dennis Double-D mould. David Lloyd, a former member of the Radio Authority, acknowledges Spence's impact saying: \\"His was a powerful voice and influence on the station from launch.\\"http://www.davidlloydradio.com/#!insight/ckzl But perhaps Spence's greatest achievement was to know when the pirate days had become tired and old, well before parodies like Smashie and Nicey started to bite those pirate DJs who became part of the BBC Radio establishment. At UBN he turned what would have otherwise been a minor industrial radio station into an unlikely but significant source of major talent for ILR.Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010 p.120 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ Together with his work at Radio Trent and the National Broadcasting School, he produced not one but several generations of presenters who knew how to respect an audience in the best possible way - by keeping as many of them as possible entertained. His contribution to making independent radio a viable alternative to the monolithic BBC radio of the day was significant. As Dale Winton put it, he was already \\"an influential guy\\" before he even began to play a pivotal role at the National Broadcasting School. Spence's former Radio London colleague Dave Cash, acknowledging that Spence as Dave Dennis had been a superb DJ, added: \\"His true vocation was teaching.\\"Dave Cash, 2012, He Sounds Much Taller - Part 1, Chapter 2 https://play.spotify.com/album/2vIDbwlKVDW4xx5W4p5SDh In a profession tending naturally towards self-obsession, while Radio 1's ex-pirate DJs matured into their comfortable berths, Spence was developing not his own presentation style but that of others - together with a finely tuned ear for how a station should sound, what made it distinctive from its competitors, and most importantly how it could stay in touch with its audience.

Kituyi was known for writing and publishing investigative journalism about Kenyan politics. Kituyi was murdered by unknown assailants.  Personal  John Kituyi, 63, was married to Esther Kituyi, and the couple had seven children. Kituyi resided in the western part of Eldoret, Kenya in Pioneer Estates, and he also had a rural home in Naitiri, Bungoma County.  Career  In the early stages of his career, John Kituyi worked as a journalist for The Standard, a daily newspaper in Eldoret, Kenya in the late 1980s, where he was at one point a bureau chief. After working at The Standard for more than ten years, Kituyi left in 1995 to establish the weekly newspaper, The Mirror Weekly, based out of Eldoret. Kituyi worked as the editor and publisher of this weekly newspaper while also writing some of his own articles. The Mirror Weekly is known for reporting local issues while also featuring controversial national matters. As a journalist, Kituyi's articles mainly focused on investigative reporting and the politics of local and national government.  Death  A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists raised a possible connection that Kituyi's murdered was the result of an article he both wrote and published in The Daily Nation (\\"Now ICC plot to jail Ruto\\") about a case before the International Criminal Court involving Deputy President William Ruto and former radio journalist Joshua Sang. At the time of his death, Kituyi was investigating the disappearance of court witness, Meshack Yebei. Two assailants on motorcycles attacked John Kituyi while he was returning home by foot after work around 7:30 p.m. on 30 April 2015. Kituyi had first stopped at the Country Lodge Club and at the time of his attack, he was walking the short distance between the club and his home. The attackers repeatedly hit Kituyi with blunt objects and then stole his mobile phone but they did not rob him of his valuables. After the attack, witnesses found Kituyi on the street in a pool of blood and called for help. He was first taken to Eldoret's Reale Hospital, which rejected him because its facility was over occupied, and then he was moved to Eldoret Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, and he was finally identified at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. Kituyi suffered from a severe back injury and multiple bruises across his body. Kituyi was laid to rest on 16 May 2015 in Naitiri, Bungoma County, Kenya. There were two guards who were questioned shortly after the murder. More progress in the case was made in July when a man with the Kenyan Defense Forces had possession of Kituyi's sim card and was charged with robbery and pleaded innocent.  Context  In Kenya, violence targeting journalists has increased, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Journalists are currently uncertain because of the conflict between Kenya's Constitution, which was adopted in 2010 and grants press freedom, and laws created under President Uhuru Kenyatta that impose restrictions. Since January 2015, there have been 19 reports from journalists stating that they have been threatened or attacked; all but three of these cases involved public officials of Kenya. Cases like this in Kenya are rarely prosecuted.  Reactions  Street scene in Eldoret, Kenya.John Kituyi was the founder, publisher, and editor of The Mirror Weekly in Eldoret, Kenya. The Mirror Weekly was known for publishing articles about politics of Western Kenya and its investigative reporting. Kituyi's murder while investigating a missing witness in Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto's ICC case, has increased uncertainty about safety and press rights in the country. Irina Bokova, director-general of the UNESCO, condemned the death of John Kituyi and urged Kenyan authorities to launch an investigation. Kituyi's family and colleagues also called for an investigation. Henry Maina, Eastern Africa regional director for Article 19 said, \\"Kituyi's murder is an assault on press freedom and part of a sustained pattern of intimidating and harassing journalists, while nothing is done to the perpetrators even if they are known.\\" He refers to the many journalists across Africa who are being harassed, kidnapped, and/or murdered.

It is set in a post apocalyptic world that mixes reality led to the decay of the society with real manifestations of mythological beliefs and superstitions of different cultures. The main plot is presented in a trilogy of graphic novels with illustration made by both artists. The protagonist Luz travels through the universe of Malefic Time and meets different people, allies, enemies and their way of surviving in this broken world. The project has been carried to other media (comics, novels, RPG, music, shorts) that much develop different aspects of the universe expanding and making it deeper. Fictional setting Malefic Time is a fantasy universe where humanity is not alone in creation: there are other creatures, called in many ways over the years, now known as Celestials and Fallen. These creatures of immense power have been influencing, manipulating us and waging a war in which each side tries to crush the other. In 2019 the world began to sink: social structures crumbled, the world economy disappeared and riots began due to a disease that began to spread worldwide. It was then in 2020 when Celestials and The Fallen showed openly to the world. This is 2033, and everyone has in mind that it is the end of an era. According to astrology the Age of Aquarius comes, a shift to inward development of individuals and the rejection of imposed laws that will strongly influence human behavior.  Plot summary  = Luz ‚Äì Malefic = She is presented for the first time on the cover of the illustrated book with the same title more than 20 years ago. But it is not until in 2010 when Luis Royo and Romulo Royo retake the character, her story is told and the ‚ÄúMalefic Time‚Äù project is founded. Malefic is the protagonist, all the plot consists of her development and in the search for her identity. Her real name is Luz. She moves through New York City looking for libraries and museums, she knows that there, in the old books and ancient paintings are all the keys to understand this new world and to find out who she is. In the dilapidated warehouse where she lives there are hundreds of books and papers that she brings from her walks through the city libraries, all of them with apocalyptic themes, Romanesque paintings books, books of Masons, witchcraft, alchemy, notes of prophets and seers, oriental writings, Aztec and African art, reproductions of paintings from ancient times, Greek mythology or Egyptian hieroglyphics studies. All part of a puzzle about the final judgment. The search for identity, answer her questions, the cracks and falls are what determine her. It is a broken character built on the bipolarity between her power, determination, great resolute and combat skills, and her apparent role in the future destiny against the huge fragility supposed by the doubts, questions, and frequent states of obsession, disease, collapse and trance. She is a charismatic character with multiple layers that make her an atypical heroine/anti-heroine through which the deep folds and nuances of the story are known. The course of his journey is from New York City to Tokyo and Paris. On a trip of spiritual quest. A road full of mysticism and forbidden topics by the current culture. A symbol of change for the man. An uprising against the oppression of the laws and regulations that govern the world. = Celestials and The Fallen = These beings have the easy association with the Angels and Demons in the Judeo-Christian biblical tradition in appearance but are much more. They have been the origin of all gods for all cultures, they changed names throughout history, but their conflict and their intervention goes back to the earliest days of mankind. The first indications of their existence are dated back to Sumerian religion (the cradle of human civilization) and then extends, altered, contaminated, adapted to all forms of religion in the ancient Mediterranean and soon after to other societies of the world. The initial conflict, represented biblically with angel Lucifer's rebellion against God establishes an unbridgeable rift between these two positions that have continued settling their disputes over human existence. Both positions represent two diametrical ways of understanding existence with the following association, among others, these inherent values: *Celestials: The Sun, the masculine, the Authority, order, the standard, foreign, Age of Pisces. *The Fallen: The Moon, the Feminine, Nature, Spirituality, instinct, the inside, Age of Aquarius.

In 2016, Bagley joined a House bipartisan majority to enact a one-cent increase in the state sales tax. =Attempt to end automobile inspection stickers= In April 2017, Representative Bagley proposed legislation which would halt most automobile inspection stickers required annually since 1961 on all vehicles in Louisiana. Bagley's bill would limit inspections to student transportation and commercial vehicles and would not impact the parishes of Ascension, East Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, and West Baton Rouge, which are required under the Clean Air Act of 1963 to conduct specialized inspections for vehicle emissions, Displayed on windshields, the stickers are considered proof that the inspections was conducted. On May 15, 2017, the House Transportation Committee, citing skepticism for Bagley's legislation by the Louisiana State Police, tabled the bill. Bagley claimed that the legislation would end what he called a $6 million per year industry in fraudulent stickers. Representative Terry Landry, a former state police superintendent from Lafayette Parish, said that he thought ending inspections would be \\"sacrificing safety. I just fundamentally disagree with your bill.\\" As the issue played out, lobbyists representing those who perform the inspections also lined up against Bagley's proposal. These businesses make nearly half of their overall income from the inspections. Bagley favored adding the inspection fee to one's motor vehicle registration. However, the Louisiana Constituiton of 1974 places a cap on the amount of that fee. Hence the proposed change would require a constitutional amendment to adjust the vehicle registration fee structure. Bagley vowed, assuming that he is reelected in 2019, to bring back the matter in the 2021 economic session of the legislature. Bagley said that he wants to hire 150 new state troopers with money that the state spends on the inspections. Louisiana hence remains one of thirteen states with motor vehicle inspection laws.

He was murdered as a result of exposing illegal mining and land grabbing.  Personal  Before his murder, Kothari told police he had received threats. He was already known to police, since as a result of his controversial reporting, Kothari had a long list of over 19 false accusations on record in various police stations in his home state, including common goat theft and rape. Although he was jailed for over 16 months awaiting trial for rape, none of the cases led to a conviction. Both Kothari‚Äôs sister Sandhya and brother Rahul begged him to stop reporting about the sand mafia as it was risking his life.  Career  Kothari came from a business family. His father had a small convenience store, known in India as a kirana store. Kothari and his two brothers were forest contractors and shared this family business before his brothers opened an automobile repair shop and Kothari went into journalism at Deshbandhu. Sandeep Kothari was a Hindi-language journalist since 2005. Over his career, he wrote for prominent newspapers, such as Nai Duniya, Hari Bhoomi (sometimes transliterated as Haribhumi), and Deshbandhu around Jabalpur. After 2012, he left Nai Duniya to freelance. He specialized in investigating illegal chit fund schemes, manganese and sand mining and land grabbing around Katangi and Tirodi, and he became adept at using India's Right to Information (RTI) Act to get information about his subjects. More recently, Kothari had turned to freelance work as journalist and published his own work out of Katangi. The police called him a \\"history sheeter\\" -- a term used to disparage journalism -- in reference to his recent investigations around Katangi.  Death  Sandeep Kothari's murderers first attacked him and his friend, who were on their way to the village of Umri, in the Balaghat district, by ramming their four-wheel motor vehicle into their bike on 19 June 2015. While his friend managed to escape, Kothari was beaten and kidnapped from the site of the wreckage. After the abduction, Kothari's friend was the one who reported to the police that Kothari was missing. The men first strangled him, dumped him next to a railroad track and then burned him alive. His autopsy showed he had been alive when he was burned but also lists strangulation as a cause of death. After the murder, the Madhya Pradesh Police appointed a Special Investigation Team to look into the murder. Three arrests have been made after the murder. Taken in to custody were Brijendra Geharwar, Vishal Tandi (both from Katangi), and Rakesh Naraswani. The three suspects are alleged to have been involved with illegal mining and confessed to the murder. They had previously tried to frame Kothari on a charge of rape but were unsuccessful in court. The accused led police to the site where they had left Kothari for dead. Police found his body at Butibori, Nagpur, Maharashtra, which is 50 km from Wardha, Maharashtra. Police received complaints that Kothari was a blackmailer, however, his family and colleagues assert that these are just more false accusations like the ones made during his final years. There has not yet been a conviction in the case  Context  Illegal sandmining operation in India.Kothari‚Äôs murder was connected to the local sand mining mafia as he was exposing their practices. Sand mining is an illegal process of removing sand and selling it as material to a construction company. Worldwide sand mining is a $70 billion industry. The activity is primarily a local operation that is set up close to construction work. India does not have enough legal sand to fill demand. However, the Indian Planning Commission estimates that sand mining constitutes almost 9 percent of the nation's GDP. While sand mining has a high profit margin for those who run it, it has environmental impacts and is therefore regulated. Sand mining companies, therefore have been known to rely on bribing government and law enforcement to work untouched. The mining mafias in India have been implicated in hundreds of deaths, including government officials, police officers, journalists, and citizens.  Impact  Sandeep Kothari was targeted by the mining mafia because of his reports to expose the sand mafia and illegal mining activities. However, Kothari was not the only journalist to suffer this fate at the hands of the sand mafia. Weeks before Sandeep's murder, Jagendra Singh, a journalist from Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, was burned 1 June 2015 and he died from the attack on 8 June. And Haider Khan, a journalist from the same area as Singh, was beaten by the sand mining mafia.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, director- general of UNESCO, has called for an investigation into the death of Sandeep Kothari and is urging authorities to bring the crime‚Äôs perpetrators to trial. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said, \\"It is critical for the safety and independence of media in India that these incidents be investigated swiftly and transparently and with immediate steps taken to remedy the situation.\\" The Indian Journalists Union (IJU) and the Press Council of India (PCI) addressed the \\"intolerance\\" directed at Indian journalists that raises their security risks, and have called on the police departments of India to investigate Kothari‚Äôs murder along with the other recent.

The church is situated in the southern H√∏jbjerg neighbourhood on H√∏rhavevej. Frederik's Church is a parish church, and the only church in Sk√•de Parish, under the Diocese of Aarhus within the Church of Denmark, the Danish state church. The church serves some 11.000 parishioners in Sk√•de Parish and holds weekly sermons along with weddings, burials and baptisms. Frederik's Church is the last Danish church which draws obvious inspiration from the medieval architectural tradition; in the years following the Second World War architecture generally diverged in many different directions. The architect was Harald L√∏nborg-Jensen who also designed √Öbyh√∏j Church. In the first years Frederik's Church was an annex church of Holme Parish and the first priest was also the priest of Holme Parish but Sk√•de Parish was created and got its own pastorate in 1949 when Holme Parish was divided. The church is named after crown prince Frederik, later king Frederick IX and the initials for the royal couple of the time is engraved in the front most benches. Frederik's Church had an adjacent building for parish council meetings and communal work added in 1973. Growing population through the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the church itself being too small for the needs of the community so it was decided to add a building specifically for other activities. The building was named Frederiksg√•rden to follow the tradition of the church. Frederik's Church is a Green Church (Gr√∏n Kirke). Green Churches is a network of Danish churches dedicated to implement and further an environmentally friendly operation and climate actions in relation to the current climate crisis. The network agenda was launched by the National Council of Churches in Denmark (NCCD) in 2011.

In 2015 the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) came to an end and the process of defining an international development agenda to replace them culminated with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP21, which aims to achieve a global agreement on climate action, will also be held at the end of 2015. In this context 2015 was considered a timely opportunity to raise awareness on the European Union's current development co-operation and to encourage engagement of EU citizens in development policy.  Objectives  The objectives of the European Year for Development are to: # Inform Union citizens about EU development co-operation, the results that the EU, together with Member States, has achieved as a global player and will continue to pursue # # Foster direct involvement, critical thinking and active interest of Union citizens and stakeholders in development co-operation. # # Raise awareness of the mutual benefits of EU development co- operation, achieve a broader understanding of policy coherence for development and foster a sense of joint responsibility, solidarity and opportunity in an increasingly interdependent world.  Target audience  The campaign aims to reach the broadest number of people in EU member states. While particular focus is placed on young people (primarily between 15‚Äì24 years old), other key target audiences include European development experts, academia, civil society in the 28 EU Member States, policy makers, media and the broader public. = Communication strategy = The EYD2015 is a synergistic campaign, coordinated by the European Commission and implemented in a decentralised manner in the participating EU member states and in partnership with other EU development stakeholders. Partners include EU institutions, international organisations, development NGOs, academia, private sector and among others. Central to the EYD2015 communication campaign are the principles of co-communication, co- branding and co-creation of content. Partners initiate and carry out their own EYD2015 activities in line with the EYD2015 objectives and make use of communication guidelines and toolkits provided by the European Commission. The official EYD2015 website brings in one space all the elements of the EYD2015 campaign, featuring all participating organisations, a calendar of events at EU level and in the member states and stories and posts from all partners, showcasing the plurality of perspectives on EU development co-operation. The EYD2015 Twitter and Facebook accounts are curated by campaign partners in turns of one week.

The series is about four kids who navigate through middle school and fight evil assassins at the same time. It first premiered on Cartoon Network in the United States and Ireland on November 2, 2015. Supernoobs was created by Scott Fellows, who also created Johnny Test, Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, Big Time Rush, and 100 Things to Do Before High School. On January 11, 2018, DHX announced that the second season will air on its Family Channel, and YTV instead of Teletoon. The second season has been picked up by Cartoon Network across Europe, United States, the Middle East and Africa, and Hulu in the United States.https://www.dhxmedia.com/financial-news/dhx-media-announces-season-two- supernoobs-turner-family-channel/ The show ended on February 7, 2019. Plot 12-year-old nerdy best friends Tyler, Kevin, Shope, and the Roach not only need to contend with the harrowing halls of their Canadian middle school, but must survive microcosmic assassins infecting earthlings bent on destroying them and the entire world. Characters =The Supernoobs= Four middle school students from the town of Cornbury unexpectedly find themselves gifted with alien orbs known as Battle Balls that grant them amazing powers. However, when the Supernoobs aren't fighting the virus, they tend to use their powers irresponsibly and/or end up losing their Battle Balls which lead them into crazy disasters. * Tyler Bowman (voiced by Matt Hill) ‚Äì The wielder of the blue battle ball, which gives him the power to teleport and enhances his natural senses, giving him abilities such as mind-reading. It transforms his blonde hair to blue. Tyler is the group's leader and oftentimes moral compass, but is also distracted by his feelings for fellow student Amy Anderson. After his battle ball was damaged due to paint corrosion, he and the noobs go to the Ball Master to have them repaired. Not only did she restore his old powers but he also gained a new one as well. His newly acquired power is telekinesis. * Kevin Reynolds (voiced by Richard Ian Cox) ‚Äì The wielder of the red battle ball, which enables him to shapeshift into various animals. A running gag involves Kevin turning into an opossum or something other than what he intended to turn into. The battle ball transforms his black hair to red. Kevin is the most selfish and irresponsible member of the team, often employing his Battle Ball for his own amusement and personal gain or making suggestions that get the group into trouble. After his battle ball becomes damaged due to paint corrosion, he and the noobs go to the Ball Master to have them repaired. Not only did she restore his old powers but he also gained a new one as well. He is now able to transform into a Virus version of animals. Kevin is also implied to have feelings for Shope as he stated under mind control; he hoped to one day \\"marry\\" Shope. * Jennifer Shope (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain) ‚Äì The most scientifically minded of the group, who also considers herself to be the smartest but she sometimes relies on her friends to do some of her work so she could get her \\"Easy A\\". Shope wields the purple battle ball, which allows her to harness the natural forces around her like water and electricity. It transforms her black hair to purple. She is commonly known by her surname Shope to her friends, whereas most adults refer to her by her given name Jennifer. Oddly, the sign on her shirt closely resembles the logo of the Santiago Metro. After her battle ball was damaged due to paint corrosion, she and the noobs go to the Ball Master to have them repaired. Not only did she restore her old powers but he also gained a new one as well. She can now bend subatomic frequencies. * Theodore Roachmont (voiced by Lee Tockar, usually just called Roach or The Roach) ‚Äì The shortest member of the Supernoobs with unruly red hair in which various objects can be found in. Roach wields the green battle ball, which grants him the power of flight and super strength through enlarging his fists. It transforms his red hair to green. He is shown to be the most innocent and least selfish member of the noobs although he can be the most clueless and gullible member as well. Though not usually the team's strategist, he does occasionally stumble onto brilliant ideas, such as discovering that the Battle Balls could combine to create a vehicle. He also tends to develop crushes on mature female characters, such as XR4Ti, the Noobs' theater teacher, and an alien princess. After his battle ball was damaged due to paint corrosion, he and the noobs go to the Ball Master to have them repaired. Not only did she restore his old powers but he also gained a new one as well; the power to disarm himself (as in remove his arms from his sockets). =Civilians= * Jock Jockerson (voiced by Michael Adamthwaite) ‚Äì A classmate of the Noobs noted for his large size and athletic ability, Jock is a bully who often refers to himself in the third person. He is not highly intelligent, quick to anger, and often ends up in his underwear as a result of the Noobs' misadventures. * Principal Warmerammer (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse) ‚Äì The stern administrator of the Noobs' school who is suspicious of their activities. (She was finding what's the noobs are hiding ) * Amy Anderson (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse) ‚Äì A classmate of the Noobs whom Tyler has a crush on, though he lacks confidence in approaching/speaking to her. Despite this, she seems to reciprocate his feelings to some degree, and unwittingly develops a crush on his superhero alter ego after he saves her from a Virus attack. * Sue Newswoman (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain) ‚Äì A newscaster who often covers stories of the Noobs' misadventures. * Mr. and Mrs. Shope (voiced by Doron Bell and Kathleen Barr) ‚Äì Jennifer Shope's mild-mannered parents, who are somewhat skeptical of her friendship with the other Noobs. Due to being unaware of their daughter's superhero status, they become fearful that the boys are having a negative influence on her due to her displaying uncharacteristic behavior and once threatened to send her to a boarding school if she continued to display such behavior. Fortunately, Zen-disguised as Jennifer -manages to convince them to trust in her judgment and ability to stay on top of things, though they remain strict. Mem later impersonated Mr. Shope at Jennifer's parent-teacher conference, as the Noobs' evil-fighting activities had affected their schoolwork and they didn't want their real parents to know. * Mrs. Bowman ‚Äì Tyler's mother whom he greatly resembles; Tyler's father has not been seen or mentioned, possibly indicating that she is divorced or a widow. Her first outfit-seen when Zen and Kevin impersonated her for Tyler's parent teacher conference-consists of a purple shirt with a nametag and black pants, possibly the uniform of her job. * Mr. and Mrs. Roachmont ‚Äì The Roach's parents, who appear to be fairly well-to-do based on their home and usual clothing. Mr. Roachmont is a large man with brown hair who often wears a suit, while Mrs. Roachmont is a shapely blond-haired woman who was first seen in a red dress. The two are both apparently afraid of mice, as Kevin once scared them out of their home by taking the form of a mouse. * Coach Huntz (voiced by Lee Tockar) ‚Äì the gym teacher and coach of the football team at Cornbury Middle School, known for yelling and blowing his whistle. * Emmas ‚Äì Three little girls who witness the Noobs fighting evil in civilian form and threaten to expose them unless they concede to all of their demands. They later relent after the Noobs save them from a virus-infected eagle. =Benevolent Alliance= An intergalactic organization dedicated to battling the virus and bringing the people responsible for creating the virus to justice. * Zenblock/Zen (voiced by Michael Adamthwaite) ‚Äì A blue alien who is constantly accompanied by Mem, whom he is virtually identical to physically apart from their coloring, teeth, and nose shape. Zen is the gruffer of the pair, but like Mem is largely unfamiliar with Earth culture and can be as immature and childish as Mem on occasion. They were sent to Earth by the Benevolent Alliance to recruit warriors for the battle against the virus, but mistook the four children in mismatched football gear and armed with slingshots for soldiers. While he is often disparaging of the Noobs' skills- having been the one to give them their less-than flattering team name-he does have a soft spot for them, which led to him being assigned along with Mem to train the group. He is also shown to have a strained sibling-like friendship with Mem as he and Mem often disagree and blame each other on many things although they do many activities together and have some similar interests. He is also shown to have a sleepwalking problem, which he calls \\"sleepfighting\\". Zen often speaks with an Austrian accent similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger and is capable of disguising himself as an adult male human with brown hair who usually wears a blue outfit including a sweater vest, during which he employs the alias \\"Rob\\". * Memnock/Mem (voiced by Bill Mondy) ‚Äì A green alien and companion to Zen, who like Zen, also possesses special armor that grants him similar powers to the Noobs. Mem is the softer spoken and more sensitive of the pair but like Zen, he is often annoyed and embarrassed by the irresponsible shenanigans of the Noobs and sometimes falls victim to them. Despite being a virus warrior Mem is often shown as the most immature and childish member of the duo as his willingness to understand Earth culture often distracts him from taking care of the noobs. Mem and Zen are shown to have a friendship that is similar to that of brothers as they have the tendency to blame each other for things, such as the mistake of selecting the Supernoobs, though they usually come to their aid during battles. He is also shown to like cooking food as a hobby. In human form, Mem appears as a blonde man named \\"Bob\\" who usually wears a green outfit that includes a sweater that he wears with the arms tied around his neck. * XR4Ti (voiced by Rebecca Shoichet) ‚Äì The feminine artificial intelligence controlling Mem and Zen's ship, the Galacticus. XR4Ti is often the voice of reason, even more so than the occasionally irresponsible and immature Mem and Zen, but deals with limitations of being a computer with no power to act on her own. Because of her role as a voice of reason, XR4Ti has a stern mother-child like relationship with both Mem and Zen and the noobs although she is unaware of Roach's crush on her. Her name is reused from a spaceship from Scott Fellows' previous animated series, Johnny Test. * General Blorgon (voiced by Scott McNeil) ‚Äì The leader of the Benevolent Alliance, a blue-skinned and bald alien with telepathic abilities. Blorgon is Mem and Zen's superior, and usually appears with two aides or colleagues who assist him in his duties. Though noble, Blorgon is known for his harsh methods, such as subjecting new virus warrior recruits to harsh tests or punishing those irresponsible enough to misplace their battle balls by having their brains sucked out (though the latter is only implied). * Secretary Hedies(voiced by Maryke Hendrikse) One of the Elders of the Benevolent Alliance. * Secretary Techn'ut (voiced by Lee Tockar) One of the Eldersof the Benevolent Alliance. * Rovu ‚Äì An alien who appears to be of the same or a similar species to Mem and Zen, but with reddish brown skin and a blue pod on his armor. Like Mem and Zen Rovu is assigned to recruit warriors to battle the Virus, but has been much more successful than them and won the Recruiter of the Year award seven times in a row. He is highly egotistical and enjoys rubbing his success in the faces of others, especially Mem and Zen, who are occasionally bullied by him every so often. He was humbled when the Supernoobs rescued the entire New Virus Warriors convention from Count Venamus, resulting in Mem and Zen receiving the Recruiter of the Year award and breaking his streak. =Villains= * \\"V\\"irus ‚Äì It comes from outer space and infects different planets. Its purpose is to infect any living organism and turn their hosts into rampaging monsters in order to wreak havoc on other planets, including Earth. The Virus is produced by the unknown alien creators for reasons unknown. The Benevolent Alliance and the Supernoobs battle the Virus and also seek to find out who are the creators of the virus. * Count Venamus (voiced by Trevor Devall) ‚Äì One of the creators' agents and he's a wanted criminal throughout the galaxy. His job is to infect the warriors that are battling the virus. The Benevolent alliance and the Supernoobs are trying to capture him in hopes that he'll have the information about the creators of the virus. Until his first encounter with the Supernoobs his invisibility power/technology had made him a mysterious figure whose very existence was uncertain; however, the Noobs manage to thwart his plan and his identity now exposed, leading him to swear vengeance. He has engaged the Noobs on several occasions since, but is usually defeated through the Noobs' quick- thinking and/or dumb luck. * Venaminions - Bestial creatures in service to Count Venamus; they are strong and flight-capable but seem to rely on Venamus' leadership in order to function at any level of competence. * The Creators of the Virus ‚Äì Very little about the creators is known only that they created the virus and unleashed it throughout the universe. They have agents like Count Venamus to help infect the universe. One such creator is revealed to have six glaring red eyes and speaks in a language only Venamus understands * Mr. Wertz (voiced by Michael Adamthwaite) ‚Äì Formerly a science teacher at the Noobs' school, Mr. Wertz suffers from paranoia and megalomania, having believed in the existence of aliens before he ever encountered Mem and Zen and learned of the Noobs' powers. Upon learning of these he attempted to expose them, but without proof was dismissed as insane. He later tries to enslave all of Cornbury by inventing goggles that allow him to use mind control on those who wear it but Shope manages to stop him. He got hold of the virus and tries to use to take over the world; however, he was defeated by the Noobs and was taken back to the School Board. * The Incredibly Amazing Man (voiced by Andrew Francis) ‚Äì A galactic \\"superhero\\" who fights the virus and is more competent than the Noobs but proves incredibly destructive in the process; he refuses to acknowledge this fact due to his highly arrogant, narcissistic, and egotistical personality. He possesses various abilities such as flight, laser vision, super strength, and elongation. He is also obsessed with selling his merchandise to his fans, and says \\"you're welcome\\" quite often, even when it makes absolutely no sense.

It seeks \\"to provide a platform for groundbreaking architectural projects and spatial experiments that demonstrate how creativity and innovation can radically transform our lived experience.\\" Founded in 2014, the biennial is managed by a charitable corporation under the auspices of the city's Cultural Affairs department, and sponsored by public and private organizations and individuals. Expositions The first of its kind in North America, the inaugural iteration of the biennale took place in Chicago between October, 2015 and January, 2016, and was headquartered at the Chicago Cultural Center. Its first directors were Sarah Herda and Joseph Grima. The event was championed by then-mayor Rahm Emanuel who told the Financial Times: \\"This biennial is an ode to the city's past and an echo to our future.\\" The 2015-16 biennial had entries from 104 architects or practices. The exhibitors were invitees, many from North America and Europe, but also from Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Israel, Japan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Territories, South Africa, and South Korea. The theme of this biennial was The State of the Art of Architecture. The title of the first biennial originates from a 1977 conference organized by Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman, which invited leading American designers to Chicago to discuss the current state of the field. The first biennial announced it had more than 500,000 visitors, and plans for its return in 2017. The second iteration was in 2017 with the theme Make New History, and ran from September 16, 2017 through January 7, 2018. The lead curators were Mark Lee and Sharon Johnson of Johnson Marklee. Associate curators include Sarah Hearne and Letizia Garzoli. The opening coincided with EXPO Chicago, the international contemporary art fair. More than 100 architectural practices from the Americas, Asia and Europe were selected to participate. In addition to the main site at the Cultural Center, the biennial partnered with the Chicago Community Trust to hold 2017 events at six satellite locations in other parts of Chicago: The Beverly Arts Center, DePaul Art Museum, DuSable Museum of African American History, Hyde Park Art Center, the National Museum of Mexican Art, and the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture. The second biennial drew a crowd of 550,000 and dates for a third biennial beginning in September 2019 were announced. The third biennial, under the title . . . And Other Such Stories, explores the circumstances that make the urban architectural environment. Its lead curator is Yesomi Umolu, and it is co-curated by Sepake Angiama and Paulo Tavares. It is open to the public from September 19, 2019 to January 5, 2020. The exposition features over 80 contributors from more than 20 countries. The third iteration of the biennial focuses on four main themes: land and belonging, architecture and memory, rights and advocacy, and collaboration and discussion. The Los Angeles Times found the 2019 biennial \\"eerily prescient\\" in its examination of contested urban land use issues at a time of international protest.

Its bottom layer includes pieces of cake and it is often garnished with pistachio or coconut, and chocolate chips.  Etymology  The name supangle comes from soupe anglaise, French for English soup. It can be thought to be the literal translation of the name of the Italian dessert Zuppa Inglese, but Zuppa Inglese is known by its Italian name in France and the name soupe anglaise is not used. Despite possible etymological link, the dessert supangle bears no resemblance to zuppa Inglese other than the inclusion of cake under a creamy pudding.  Preparation  Supangle is cooked from milk, sugar, flour, and cocoa powder, with butter and chocolate added. The bottom layer of supangle consists of cake, cookie, or biscuits, for which leftovers may be used. Eggs and hazelnut chocolate spread (e.g. Nutella) are also used in some recipes. It is decorated with ground pistachio or shredded coconut and served cold. Serving it with ice cream is also growing in popularity.

His work has informed the areas of social anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, trauma reactions (such as post traumatic stress disorder), obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. His research has particularly focused on developing models and treatment for these disorders using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and metacognitive therapy (MCT). He has authored over 200 publications in books and peer-reviewed journals.  Key publications  Wells' first book Attention and Emotion: A Clinical Perspective (co-authored with Gerald Matthews) presented a critique and framework for applying cognitive psychology to the understanding of psychopathology. It was awarded the 1998 British Psychological Society Book Award for significant contributions to psychology and remains a definitive text in this field; recently being reprinted for a 20th anniversary edition. Wells has authored a comprehensive treatment manual for anxiety disorders using cognitive behavioural therapy, which is widely used in UK mental health settings and includes a model and treatment for social anxiety disorder (developed with D.

It is focussed on the Walthamstow Reservoirs, built by the East London Waterworks Company between 1853 and 1904 as part of the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain. The site is one of the largest urban wetland nature reserves in Europe, and is particularly important for wildlife due to its position within the Lee Valley; a byway for migrating, wintering and breeding birds. Visitors can freely access the site's natural, industrial and social heritage in one of the capital's most densely populated urban areas. The reservoirs, under the ownership of Thames Water, also form part of a larger Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation, noted for the mixture of aquatic and terrestrial habitats on site, and for their London-wide importance (especially for birds). Setting The Wetlands, and the rest of the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain are part of the Lee Valley Park, an area stretching from Ware in Hertfordshire (9 miles north of London) to the confluence of the Lea and Thames at Blackwall. The part of the Lee Valley Park within London forms a green wedge, a mile wide at its broadest at the Walthamstow Wetlands, which extends south to include the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. South of Stratford the green wedge becomes little more than an accessible towpath along the Lea which links a number of open spaces.  History  The Walthamstow reservoirs were built on marshland adjoining the River Lea over fifty years between 1853 and 1904 by the East London Waterworks Company, growing in scale and height as the needs of London grew. The company was one of eight private water companies in London absorbed by the Metropolitan Water Board in 1904, which was subsequently abolished in 1974. Control was then transferred to the Thames Water Authority, now Thames Water. Walthamstow Reservoirs There are two significant Victorian industrial buildings still standing on the site, the Coppermill and the Marine Engine House. Several of the reservoirs were damaged during the Blitz, and the level of the (raised) Lockwood Reservoir was lowered in order to mitigate potential damage if its banks were breached by bombs.From the Wetlands official site https://www.walthamstowwetlands.com/heritage Historically the reservoirs were used and maintained purely as an element in the supply of water to London's homes, businesses and industries, but in recent decades, the site has been justifiably recognised for its ecological, landscape and amenity value. Walthamstow Reservoirs Path running between reservoirs 4 and 5 The Walthamstow Reservoirs complex is a mix of statutory (raised) reservoirs and non-statutory (in ground) reservoirs, owned and managed by Thames Water in order to supply drinking water to London.pp3 Reservoir information Retrieved December 10, 2007 The complex comprises ten water bodies: *Lockwood Reservoir *High Maynard Reservoir *Low Maynard Reservoir *East Warwick Reservoir *West Warwick Reservoir *Reservoirs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Nature Reserve =Establishment and management= The reservoirs have been developed as a public nature reserve, the Walthamstow Wetlands project, by London Wildlife Trust, in partnership with Thames Water and London Borough of Waltham Forest. The site opened to the public in October 2017. The Walthamstow Wetlands project is managed by London Wildlife Trust, in partnership with Thames Water and London Borough of Waltham Forest. The project was made possible after the Heritage Lottery Fund provided ¬£4.4 million in funding. In total Walthamstow Wetlands has a value of ¬£8m from capital works and revenue funding over five years, with Thames Water committing ¬£1.84m to the project. The Greater London Authority have also funded the Wetlands to Wetlands Greenway, improving the cycle links between Woodberry Wetlands in Manor House and Walthamstow Wetlands to encourage visitors to visit both sites. =Designations= The nature reserve is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) on account of the reservoirs' national and international importance to breeding, migratory and wintering waterbirds. It is part of a larger Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation. The Coppermill building is a Grade II listed building.  Architecture  There are two Victorian industrial structures on the site, including the Coppermill which gives its name to nearby Coppermill Lane, Coppermill Stream, and the Coppermills Water Treatment Works.http://exploringeastlondon.co.uk/Walthamstowest/Westwalthamstow.htm#Copper The Coppermill = The Marine Engine House = Constructed in 1894, the Marine Engine House, previously named the Ferry Lane Pumping Station, was built during the development of the reservoir complex. thumbThe Marine Engine House prior to renovation works and conversion into a cafe and visitor centre 300x300pxThe structure is relatively complex in form, but consists primarily of a two-storey building with a single storey building attached to its northern side. To the west of this is a further single storey building which includes, on its western side, the base of a now-demolished chimney stack. The Marine Engine House is constructed throughout in brick and architecturally is in the simplified Italianate style much used for Victorian industrial buildings, with semi-circular heads to all of the principal door and window openings. Roofs are generally finished in plain clay tiles with extensive use of patent glazed roof-lights and ridge lights in the single storey sections. The roof of the Engine House is pitched at around 45 degrees, and is half- hipped at its northern and southern ends. Doors and window frames are in painted softwood. Despite the missing chimney, and some external alterations, the building is still an imposing piece of Victorian industrial architecture. The Marine Engine House is to be repaired and refurbished with further plans for it to become an education and learning centre for visitors to the reserve. The proposal is that it will house: * Interpretation material on the site's natural and industrial heritage and amenities * A multi-functional educational space, created for use as a classroom and as a venue for seminars and events * A ‚ÄòWater and Life‚Äô exhibition * A central lobby area containing a reception and information resource * A caf√© with capacity to spill out onto an outdoor decked area; * Toilet facilities * A modest retail outlet = The Coppermill = 310x310px The Coppermill building is Grade II Listed and has undergone a number of alterations over the centuries, including the addition of an Italianate tower in 1864. The mill at Walthamstow has been mentioned several times throughout historical records. It was noted that in the 14th century, the mill was powered by the Coppermill Stream that diverted from the River Lea for use in grinding corn. In 1611, four mills are mentioned in association with the Manor of Walthamstow. From 1659 until 1703, the mill was known to have been used as a paper mill with the adjacent stream being referred to as the Paper-mill River. However, in 1699 the adjacent marshes are noted to have been referred to as Powder Mill Marsh which questions the use of the mill and suggests that it may have been used in the production of gunpowder for the English Civil War between 1642 and 1651. A number of gunpowder mills operated in the Lower Lee Valley, suggesting that the mill may have been used as such during this time. Accounts from 1703, 1710, 1712 and 1718 record the mill being used as a leather mill, with Pierre Montier, a skin-dresser, first referred to as ‚Äòthe Miller‚Äô in 1703 to be followed in turn by Peter Lefevre in 1711 and Daniel Lefevre in 1713. The mill was noted as an ‚Äòoyl mill‚Äô until 1806 when it was rebuilt and put up for sale. In 1859 the mill was acquired for ¬£4,000 by the East London Waterworks Company, which repurposed it as a pumping house. At present, the Coppermill serves as an operational hub for Thames Water  Ecology  Wood Sandpiper The Walthamstow Reservoirs support the most notable variety of breeding wetland birds among all of London's drinking water reservoirs. Supporting a significant wintering population of pochard, shoveler and gadwall, Walthamstow Wetlands is regionally important to breeding populations of grey heron, tufted duck, little egret, cormorant and other waterfowl. Because of its location in the Lee Valley, Walthamstow Wetlands attracts a range of wading birds that stop off during their often long-distance journeys. The wooded islands on No. 1 reservoir are the location of the famous heronry, at which the numbers of breeding pairs reach a level placing it in the country's top five sites. Formerly also a heronry, the two islands in No. 5 reservoir are now home to large numbers of cormorants.http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/corp/hs.xsl/6253.htm Thames Water information page Great crested grebe, pochard, tufted duck, coot, yellow wagtail, sedge warbler and reed warbler are all regular breeding visitors, whilst other regular visitors to the reservoirs include green sandpiper, common sandpiper, dunlin, redshank and lapwing, while less common species include ringed plover, little ringed plover, curlew, ruff, snipe, oystercatcher, wood sandpiper, whimbrel, golden plover and little stint. Zebra mussels, native to southern Russia and Ukraine, have become naturalised in the reservoirs and present an ongoing challenge to the water companies, as over time, their colonies can build up and cause blockages to the pipes leading from the reservoirs.Metro article on the recurring Zebra Mussel problem https://metro.co.uk/2017/03/21/massive-wall-of-molluscs-native-to-ukraine- block-london-water-network-6524082/ Nearly 300 species of plant have been recorded in the wooded areas, grass banks, fen and open water habitats of the reservoirs.  Recreation  The ten reservoirs, grounds and the Coppermill Stream form an extensive enclave of natural habitats, albeit within a man made and securely fenced infrastructure. They are visited by birdwatchers and naturalists Angling information Retrieved December 10, 2007 Thames Water Retrieved December 11, 2007 but especially by anglers. All the reservoirs are variously stocked with fish, providing both coarse fishing and fly fishing. Carp over 40 pounds have been recorded, and rainbow trout up to 5 pounds. An inexpensive day permit is required to visit the site.

He led the Garda Panteri during the war. His actions in the war included the securing of Bijeljina to Republika Srpska forces as well as the defense of the villages Smoluƒáa and Tinja. After the war, he became the chief of police in Bijeljina. He was killed in Bijeljina in 2000, due to suspected gang violence in the city after three gunmen reportedly fired upon his jeep. The first attempt on Saviƒá's life happened in July 1998. Two former Republika Srpska soldiers, Stojan Maksimoviƒá and Vladimir Neretljak, were killed in an explosion outside his house. Saviƒá accused Momƒçilo Kraji≈°nik, the then leader of the SDS, and pro-Belgrade elements in the entity's security services of attempting to plant a bomb under his car. He had been involved in anti- corruption campaigns, and had arrested many corrupt people, even supporters of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, including Joja Tintor. The Garda Panteri had also been known to have busted smugglers during the Bosnian War that were controlled by both the SDS, as well as the Republika Srpska government.  Life  Before the Bosnian War, Ljubi≈°a Saviƒá worked in Bijeljina as a social worker. In the Bosnian war between 1992 and 1995, Saviƒá commanded the Garda Panteri (), which was later incorporated as a special unit in the armed forces of the Republika Srpska. In addition to other paramilitary Serb units such as the Serb Volunteer Guard under ≈Ωeljko \\"Arkan\\" Ra≈ænatoviƒá, Saviƒá and his unit were involved in the conquest of his hometown of Bijeljina. After the conquest, it came to the massacre of Bijeljina, in which 48 to 78 civilians were killed. Saviƒá's unit also broke through the sieges of several smaller towns during the war. Saviƒá was the commander of the Batkoviƒá prison camp at Bijeljina, which was established in June 1992 on a farm where around 1,200‚Äì1,700 non-Serb prisoners of war and one-third of civilians were also allegedly detained \\"for their own protection\\". In the camp, the prisoners were housed in poor conditions, and there was mistreatment of military and civilian prisoners by Serb soldiers, even with fatalities. After the war, Saviƒá became police chief in Bijeljina. As he fought against corruption in Republika Srpska as well as had some high-ranking government officials, including Karad≈æiƒá sympathizers arrested, his number of enemies grew steadily. Joja Tintor, Karad≈æiƒá's former adviser, was arrested by Saviƒá in the spring of 1998, but was ordered by his superiors to release Tintor despite the burden of proof. He responded to this request, but continued his efforts against corruption. Saviƒá was since the victim of a repeated number of attacks. In July 1998, he narrowly escaped death by a bomb placed under his car. In this assassination, however, two of his former comrades died. After the attempted capture of Milovan Bjelica, a close friend of Saviƒá, Srdjan Kne≈æeviƒá, was shot dead outside his home in Pale. Saviƒá was also a member of the special police unit founded after the attack. Shortly after the assassination, he arrested seven suspects, including Karad≈æiƒá sympathizers once again. However, following torture allegations, he was subsequently prohibited from doing any further police work, and released the suspects. As a result, Saviƒá went further into isolation and was only able to protect his former comrades of the Garda Panteri.  Death  Saviƒá was shot dead in his vehicle near a railway station on June 7, 2000, when he stopped briefly to escort an elderly woman home. According to eyewitness reports, another vehicle suddenly appeared, from which ≈Ωdrale, already convicted of murder and unofficially released, opened fire with an automatic firearm. Saviƒá was hit by six of the thirteen bullets fired and was killed instantly. It is believed that he fell as victim to organized gang crime. His death was preceded by several months of constant observation and analysis of his way of life by ≈Ωdrale, who, together with two unknown persons, prepared the assassination. He acquired weapons, ammunition, a vehicle, clothing and radios. It was not until 2010 that he was convicted, since his clearance was not registered in the files and he therefore had an alibi. Saviƒá was buried in his home village Kovaƒçiƒái near Bijeljina in the circle of his family, friends and former comrades.  Politics  Ljubi≈°a Saviƒá was one of the founding members of Srpska Demokratska Stranka (SDS) in Bijeljina. In 1996 he left the SDS, whose leader was Radovan Karad≈æiƒá for a long time. He then founded his own party called Demokratska Stranka (RS); this participated in the party alliance consisting of five parties, Demokratski Patriotski Blok (DPB), which succeeded in the election on 14 September 1996 with two deputies (including Saviƒá himself), gaining entrance into the Parliament of the Republika Srpska. In the summer of 1997, he also supported the anti-corruption campaign of the then President of Republika Srpska, Biljana Plav≈°iƒá, who also resigned from the SDS.

Most countries with a two-round system require a candidate to win at least 50 percent of the vote to win the presidency in a single round without a follow-up election (ballotage). In Argentina a candidate wins with at least 45 percent of the vote, or with at least 40 percent of the vote and at least 10 percentage points more than the runner-up. Lower-level Argentine districts, such as the city of Buenos Aires, use the conventional two-round voting system.

Another journalist, Marvin T√∫nchez, was an injured victim of them same attack but survived. In the same area, camera operator Giovanni Guido Villatoro was killed in an unrelated crime just days after the deadly attack on the first three journalists. Death The three journalists attacked were covering an event for International Women's Day. Two suspected gunmen on a motorbike killed two journalists and injured the other while in Mazatenango Park, Mazatenango, Guatemala. The attack occurred at approximately 12:45 p.m., 10 March 2015. In all four shots were fired by the gunman. Danilo L√≥pez was shot twice and died on the scene. Frederico Salazar was shot in the back and died later at the hospital. Marvin T√∫nchez was injured by one shot fired in the incident. According to T√∫nchez, L√≥pez was the intended target of the attack. Lopez identified the source of threats against him as coming from Jos√© Linares Rojas, mayor of San Lorenzo, Suchitep√©quez. The mayor was said to have made this threat as early as July 2013, which was reported on then by Prensa Libre with the headline, \\"Mayor Threatens Journalist\\". L√≥pez repeated this claim in an interview in February 2014 and the Guatemala Human Rights Commission also made this claim after his murder.  Victims  Danilo Efra√≠n Zap√≥n L√≥pez studied at Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. He was survived by his 5-year-old daughter, and his wife was pregnant at the time of his murder. L√≥pez was a reporter for the Guatemala City daily Prensa Libre for about 10 years. He covered politics, sports and other news but he often reported on corruption with politicians and use of public funds. He had been receiving threats since 2013 but had called the attorney general's office for assistance an hour before the attack. Federico Salazar was a reporter and radio journalist for the Guatemala City station Nuevo Mundo radio for the last 3 years. Both L√≥pez and Salazar were leaders of the Suchitepequez Press Association in Guatemala. L√≥pez was its vice-president. Salazar served as its secretary. Marvin T√∫nchez is a reporter for a local Canal 30 cable TV station on channel 23 in Guatemala. He also reported for a newspaper called Publinews. Perpetrators Shortly after the murder on 10 March, police arrested two suspects in connection to the murders of L√≥pez and Salazar. An image of the two fleeing the scene on a motorcycle was captured on video at the event. The first occurred hours after the attack when Sergio Valdemar Cardona Reyes, 31, considered a suspect, was arrested on a blue motorcycle in Cuyotenango, Suchitep√©quez Department. He was accused at his hearing of being the driver. Later, Artemio de Jes√∫s Ram√≠rez Torres, alias \\"El Barbas\\" or \\"Fluff\\", 29, was captured by police in the village of El Carmen, Champerico, Retalhuleu Department. He was accused at his hearing of being the shooter. The prosecution said in March the identities of the source who ordered the attack was still under investigation. In June 2015, three more suspects were arrested in connection with the murder, including two members of the Polic√≠a Nacional Civil de Guatemala. They were Jorge Le√≥n Cabrera Sol√≠s and Artemio de Jes√∫s Ju√°rez Pichiy√°. The prosecutor said Ju√°rez Pichiy√°'s phone number was linked with the suspected perpetrators. The third arrested was German Am√≠lcar Morataya Beltr√°n.  Context  Guatemala and Honduras rank high among countries in Central America with the most unsolved murders involving journalists. Many arrests have been made but no convictions. Guatemala is historically one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. According to the Guatemala Human Rights Commission, 342 journalists were killed over the 36 years of the Guatemalan Civil War. More recently, 2014 World Press Freedom Index ranked Guatemala 125 out of 180 countries. The Committee to Protect Journalists lists 22 journalists who have been killed confirmed or unconfirmed as a result of their journalism in Guatemala since 1992. The Inter American Press Association (IAPA) reported during Guatemalan President Otto P√©rez Molina's government alone, seven journalists have been killed, four in 2013 and three on the week of 10 March 2015. From 2012 to 2015 during his term, there have been more than 200 attacks against journalists.  Impact  Danilo L√≥pez received a number of threats from politicians throughout his career. The Unit for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in Guatemala revealed that L√≥pez first reported being threatened in 2008, when the ex-governor of the department of Suchitep√©quez, Leonor Toledo allegedly threatened him by phone following critical reports of the department's management. Another article by L√≥pez in 2011 caused then-mayor of Mazatenango, Juan Manuel Delgado, to attack the journalist in the street.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"The cold-blooded murder of Danilo Lopez and Federico Salazar must not go unpunished. Press freedom and freedom of expression are backbones to democratic societies, where citizens can count on being kept informed, where they have a voice. Defending these rights means journalists must be able to work without fearing for their lives. Criminals must know that their acts will be punished.\\" Guatemala Human Rights Commission said, \\"The Guatemalan government is directly responsible for these assassinations; its inaction has allowed previous attacks against journalists to remain unsolved. This impunity has opened the door for countless cases of spurious criminal charges to be made against journalist and, as a result, there has been an increase in the censure and silencing of journalists. The government has been negligent in the development of a Protection Program for Human Rights Defenders...\\" Miguel √Ångel M√©ndez Zetina, director of Prensa Libre, said, \\"We're alerting the international community that it's time that as Guatemalans we be more concerned about the terrible climate of insecurity and ungovernability that we are experiencing in this country.\\" Memorial A memorial was constructed at the park where the two journalists were murdered.

Most of the buildings that line the square date from the rebuilding of the surrounding neighbourhood in the years after the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The square is a quiet alternative to the much busier squares Amagertorv and H√∏jbro Plads. The former church houses an exhibition space and a restaurant with outdoor service and a small playground is also located at the site. History Gedde's district map of Copenhagen St. Nicolas' Church was established in the 13th century. A graveyard was located on its eastern side. Other properties at the site belonged to Church of Our Lady, Roskilde Cathedral and Our Lady's Abbey in Sor√∏. The graveyard lay open until it was closed off from the surrounding city with a fence following the plague outbreak of 1711. The church ruin painted by C. A. Lorenzen in about 1800 The church and the surrounding neighbourhood were hit hard by the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The first houses on the square were rebuilt shortly after the fire but initial plans to rebuild the church were not realized and the church building was instead pulled down except for its large tower. The congregation was dissolved in 1804 and the graveyard was also closed down. The Fire Brigade took over the church tower in 1807 and converted the ruin into a proper fire station in 1820-23. P. C. Kl√¶strup: The Meat Market at Nikolaj Plads The new market stalls in about 1850 In 1810,the butchers on H√∏jbro Plads received permission to move their market stalls to the site of the former graveyard. Especially on warm days, the market activities resulted in a foul odor and the conditions were described as a potential health threat in 1818. The architect Christian Frederik Hansen made a proposal for a market building on the square in the 1820s but it was not realized. In 1842, the number of market stalls had grown to 82. The debate about better conditions for the market trade resurged and a complex of market building design by Peter Heinrich Christoph Hagemann was built in 1834-46\\\\. It was made of cast iron and contained 68 large and 10 small shops. The market stalls ran along the streets Lille Kongensgade, Nikolajgade, Ving√•rdsstr√¶de and Admiralgade.Dahlerup's proposal for the renovation of the church ruin and square The butchers that faced the street sold meat of superior quality while the market stalls that faced the central yard, colloquially known as \\"The Stomach\\" (Danish: Maven), sold second-rate, \\"black label\\" meat. The market stalls remained in use until they were pulled down in the early 1900s. In 1896, Vilhelm Dahlerup made a proposal for the adaptation of the church tower and square into a monument but it was not realized. At the initiative of Carl Jacobsen it was instead decided to rebuild the church. The market building remained in use until it was demolished when the new church building was inaugurated in 1917. More recent changes include the construction of a small playground. Notable buildings and structures No. 30: Sankt Nicolai Hus No. 30 is a former school for poor children operated by St. Nicolas' Parish. It was built by Andreas Hallander and Andreas Kirkerup. Andreas Hallander was also responsible for the construction of the neighbouring Sankt Nikolai Hus at No. 32 and No. 28 at the corner with Lille Kirkestr√¶de (No. 1).

The club runs senior adult and junior teams for all ages. The 1st XV senior side compete in Durham and Northumberland Division 3 and the 2nd XV play in the Northumberland Rugby Union River Coquet league. Senior games are played on Saturday afternoons. The junior boys and girls teams train and play on Sunday mornings with ages 4+ catered for. Senior training takes place at St Peters Playing Field, St Peters Road, Wallsend, NE28 7JN on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 6.45pm. Junior training takes place at St Peters Playing Field, St Peters Road, Wallsend, NE28 7JN on Tuesday evenings from 5.45pm and Sunday mornings from 9.45am.  Modern Era  In 2012 the club was finally given permission to set up home on Battle Hill Playing Field, just off St Peter's Road in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear. The area required major works to bring it up to playing standard and in 2013, thanks to funding and grants from North Tyneside Council, Sport England and the RFU, the first turf was cut in creating two first class playing pitches with adequate drainage. The new site was officially opened on Sunday 5 October when the club held Northumberland Rugby Union's inaugural Friendly Festival, which saw hundreds of children in the Under 14 age range from across the region showcasing their skills in Wallsend. The first senior team game to be played on the site was on Saturday 20 December, which saw a mixed Wallsend side face a Northern XV in a friendly fixture. Wallsend ran out comfortable winners in the end to mark a memorable day in the history of the club. thumb  Rugby World Cup 2015  Club President, Jimmy Wrightson, wrote and performed a song, along with juniors from the club, to celebrate the Rugby World Cup. You can see the video here: Wallsend RWC Song.  Notable players  *Stan Anderson, one Test match for England in the 1899 Home Nations Championship. *Micky Ward, one of Wallsend's most successful players and former Newcastle Falcons and England Saxons player. Ward was born and raised in Wallsend, having attended Burnside Community High School. He is now Director of Rugby at Blaydon RFC and scrum coach at Newcastle Falcons.  History  The earliest reference in the club's archives is a typewritten A5 sheet referring to the 1st A.G.M. of Wallsend R.F.C. at the Coach and Horses on 10 May 1881. Early Wallsend fixture lists in the club's possession are: 1889-90 which includes games against Percy Park II‚Äôs, Rockcliffe IIs and Tynedale IIs. 1890-91. Opponents include Consett, Gosforth, Percy Park and Tynedale firsts. The club also won the County No3 competition. 1897-98. Matches versus Percy Park Ists, Carlisle, Westoe, West Hartlepool, Tynedale, Durham City, Rockcliffe and Northern, (who were beaten 45-0 at home and 18-0 away). In 1899 and 1900 Wallsend won the County No2 competition. Another fixture list is 1933-34 including Ashington, Consett, Tynedale, Swan‚Äôs (relevant later), Blaydon, Westoe and North Durham, although at what level isn‚Äôt evident. The Club seems to have led a nomadic existence in the 1920s and 1930s, with no permanent home. There are conflicting records from the Club's late ‚ÄúOld Boys\\". From 1926 to 1929 the Club's home was the ‚ÄúBoundary Ground‚Äù, this being the terminal point of the tram service from Newcastle. In the early 1930s the Club were at either Stott's Farm (adjoining Swan Hunter's Recreation Ground) or ‚ÄúSanderson‚Äôs Farm‚Äù at Daisy Hill. Mid to late 1930s found the Club at ‚ÄúDene Park‚Äù Battle Hill (which may have been Bowran's Farm). During the Second World War all the Club's fixtures were played away at local Armed Services bases. The war brought the loss of seven players killed in action. A great revival took place after 1945 due to the generosity of Farmer Day and his sons Peter & Tom. ‚ÄúDay‚Äôs Farm‚Äù at Willington Square was home ground for a further nine seasons until old members hung up their boots and interest was lost locally. One of the Club's correspondents from those days states that from 1954 to 1959 Wallsend combined with Swan Hunters under the name of ‚ÄúWallsend‚Äù, but this is doubtful as the Club have a copy of a card originally headed ‚ÄúWallsend RFC‚Äù and annotated & altered to ‚ÄúSwan Hunters RFC‚Äù ‚Äî this is dated 1954 & signed by Alf Yeoman ‚Äì known to be a stalwart of Swan Hunter's Club. The connection with Swan Hunters was carried on until recent times of course, but the Club has records from the Company's magazine ‚ÄúThe Shipyard‚Äù with references to matches against Wallsend in 1935, 1937 & 1938, when Swan's teams were still ‚Äúcutting their teeth‚Äù. The Wallsend Club of today came about due to the Swan Hunter Recreation Ground being given up during the great amalgamation of Swan's, Vicker's, Hawthorn Leslie's and Readhead's into ‚ÄúBritish Shipbuilders‚Äù. Fortunately, the sports centre at Bigge's Maine had been opened and the Club were invited to move ‚Äúlock, stock & goalposts‚Äù providing it changed its name to ‚ÄúWallsend RFC‚Äù and its colours to Green & Gold. So the Club left behind ‚Äúthe Hut‚Äù and the communal concrete bath for its new home in 1969. The metamorphosis from ‚ÄúSwan‚Äôs in blue‚Äù to ‚ÄúEagles in green‚Äù was not easy. The Club had been its own masters with virtually no outside interference, but at the sports centre it was just another section and difficulties arose with regard to changing room availability and pitch condition control; plus the fact that the Club no longer had its own income, but now had fees and charges imposed upon it. With regard to playing, those were the days before leagues were formed, all fixtures apart from cup competitions were arranged on a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù basis. The Club found that, despite its asking the ‚Äúsenior‚Äù clubs in the County for 1st XV games, most would only grant 2nd or 3rd team fixtures. Wallsend, it seemed, had few ‚Äúfriends‚Äù at its own level. However, perseverance eventually led to the Club's winning the Northumberland Junior Shield in 1975, beating the much-vaunted Gosforth Falcons by 17 points to 13 at the old County Ground. Playing in that match were present-day stalwarts Jim Wrightson, Doug Pearson and Brian Thirlaway, who produced the longest drop-goal in the Club's memory ‚Äì from the halfway line and a mere couple of yards from touch! In 1983 Wallsend won the County Junior Cup (No3 Competition). That team, ‚ÄúLowery‚Äôs Men‚Äù, included Jim Wrightson, Stu Robinson, Alan Flockton and the Robison brothers Gavin & Stu (L.F.P.). Also in 1983, the Club's long-serving County Representative Dennis Douglas was appointed President of Northumberland Rugby Union, an honour not previously attained by any Wallsend member. By 1991 life at the Sports Centre had become untenable and the Club moved over the hedge to Benfield School, where the ‚Äúclubhouse‚Äù was Sam Smith's Pavilion, under the auspices of Benfield Residents‚Äô Association. The move brought about an almost immediate success in the Club's 3rd Team, ‚ÄúWallsend Eagles‚Äù being victorious in the final of the County Junior Plate Competition. With the advent of Leagues in 1992, the Club began at last to prove its worth on the field in an officially recognised way. The Club's efforts came to fruition with its winning the County Senior Plate in 2007 against Gosforth and promotion as Champions of Durham & Northumberland Division 2, holding its own in the first season at the higher level, culminating in beating Northern at McCracken Park for the first time since 1897-98. Once again though the Club began to have trouble with financial matters and availability of pitches, so once again sought playing and changing facilities elsewhere. To the Club's rescue came Beacon Hill School, who offered a pitch along with a new small block of changing rooms. On the social side of things (essential for any rugby club) the Club were made welcome at ‚ÄúThe Barking Dog‚Äù, a long established sports set-up catering mainly for football and whippets ‚Äì hence the name. 504x504px A major step towards attaining the Club's own ground took place on Wednesday 31 July 2013, when the first turf was ceremoniously cut at Battle Hill Playing Fields at the top of St. Peter's Road. That was to signal the start of levelling the playing area and installing drainage, which proceeded over the autumn and winter, then continued into the early months of 2014. Since then, the area has been completely fenced off, with gates at strategic positions for ball recovery. The principal entry for vehicles is on Caesar Way, this being the first exit from the small roundabout at the top of St. Peter's Road. For the time being the Club's Junior sides will play on a Sunday on the new pitch ‚Äì but the Club's Senior Fifteen played a special friendly fixture against a Northern RFC side to officially open the new pitches on Saturday 20 December 2014, during which, at half time, mince pies and port wine were served to players, match officials and spectators. Eventually, of course, the Club's aim is to have (at long last) a genuine home of Rugby in Wallsend, but most importantly under its own control. Development of the new site continues with car parking facilities planned for the near future and bricks & mortar, the Club's own clubhouse, as its long term aspirations.

It was produced by Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd, and uses the \\"Cortex Action\\" variant of Margaret Weis Production's proprietary Cortex Plus game system. On 1 November 2016, Margaret Weis Productions released a statement announcing that Cam Banks and his new design studio Magic Vacuum had licensed the original Cortex System and Cortex Plus system and would be \\"taking over the design, development, and publishing of games based on these rules... for 2017 and beyond,\\" coinciding with \\"Margaret‚Äôs retirement from RPG development to focus on her current novel and film projects.\\" After a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised $84,430 for a new edition of Cortex, to be called 'Cortex Prime,' on May 29, 2017, it was announced on September 19, 2019, that Fandom had purchased the rights to the Cortex system from Margaret Weis publications and would be fulfilling all pledges from the crowdfunding effort. Setting and themes The Firefly setting is an example of the space western genre, a blending of science fiction and western genres, where high technology mixes with frontier life on newly terraformed planets. This is how the game's core rules describe the game's setting: > Firefly is a space western television series that debuted on the Fox > Television Network in 2002. The show takes place in the 26th century and > follows the comings and goings of a close-knit crew led by Captain Malcolm > Reynolds. ...The show follows the trials and tribulations of Mal and eight > other folks as they fly around on a Firefly-class transport from job to job, > planet to planet, in the year 2517. Part of what makes the Firefly TV series > so much fun to watch is that you find out more about Mal, Zoe, Wash, Simon, > River, Jayne, Book, Inara, and Kaylee with each passing episode. Admittedly, > life for Mal and his crew is harder than it needs to be. As it turns out, > there's a darn good reason for it-- they insist on surviving on their own > terms instead of settling down on Alliance-friendly planets.Valentinelli, > Monica. \\"Firefly Role-Playing Game,\\" page 7. Margaret Weis Productions. > Williams Bay, WI. 2014. In an interview with the GeekNative website, Firefly line developer and lead writer Monica Valentinelli described how the show's setting and theme were central to her process in designing the game: > At their core, every game asks two questions regardless of genre: What do > players do when they‚Äôre sitting around the table? What does your character > do for themselves and for the group? Once you answer those two questions, > you will have a strong foundation for a game. Think of these questions as > the elevator pitch or tagline ‚Äì but for a game. In Dune, you‚Äôll play a > member of the Spacing Guild who‚Äôll work with other diplomats to ensure the > spice keeps flowing from Arrakis. In Firefly, you‚Äôll join a crew to find a > job and keep flying across the ‚ÄòVerse in spite of many obstacles, e.g, 'Find > a Crew, Find a Job, Keep Flying.' Then, once a game designer has those > questions answered, we extend out from there: System. Pacing. Conflict. > Naming conventions. Worldbuilding. Characters. Equipment. Valentinelli also said that, in designing this game, \\"My primary responsibility is to the Browncoat fans, and making sure that I give them as much as possible, both setting-wise and system-wise, to make sure that this is done really well.\\" Licensing Although the Firefly RPG is sometimes mistaken for a spin-off from Margaret Weis Production's earlier Serenity Role Playing Game, the two games were produced under separate licenses and utilize very different game systems. In an interview with BoardGameGeekTV, line developer and lead writer Monica Valentinelli described the differences between the two licenses this way: > In 2005, Margaret Weis Productions put out another game called the Serenity > RPG. ...[The Firefly RPG] is only based on the TV show‚Äîit's a completely > different license. It's really kind of fascinating how that works because a > lot of fans didn't realize that Universal put out the movie and Fox [put out > the TV show]. ...From a business standpoint they're two separate things, but > from a universe / continuity standpoint they're not. Margaret Weis, the game's publisher, described being surprised about receiving a license to produce the Firefly roleplaying game: > Well, it was kind of odd. We turned in a proposal to Fox, just because it > was something I had always wanted to do. I can't remember how long ago, and > we didn't hear-- I guess we got a nice little 'thank you' note or > something-- and we said, 'Okay, that's that,' and just kind of forgot about > it. And then one day, out of the blue, Fox came to us and said, 'Hey! You > know, we really liked what you guys did-- and we were wondering if you'd be > interested in having a license?' System Monica Valentinelli explained the game systems' design process in an interview with Dungeon Crawlers Radio: > Margaret's vision for the game was to make it really fun and easy to play. > But we kind of had a really interesting situation because we have fans of > Margaret Weis Productions that remember when the Serenity RPG came out and > played the Cortex System, and then for the past eight years we've also had > the Cortex Plus system in its various iterations... So what we did was went > back to the drawing board, and our systems team developed a game based on > Margaret's wish for this to be easy to play, but also give somewhat of a nod > to our roots, without essentially shutting off everything that's been done > in the last eight years. So what we have is a new streamlined system that's > been adapted for Firefly. Cortex Plus‚Äîunlike its predecessor, the Cortex System, which was used in the Serenity RPG‚Äîis a roll and keep system, in which you roll one die from each of several categories and keep the two highest dice in your dice pool. Cortex Plus uses polyhedral dice common to many roleplaying games and utilizes standard dice notation, ranging from d4 (a 4 sided tetrahedral die) to d12 (a 12-sided dodecahedral die). The cubed d6 is the \\"default\\" die used in the game. Cortex Plus uses dice pools ranging from d4 (terrible) to d12 (the best possible). Every die in your pool that rolls a natural 1 (called an 'Opportunity') not only doesn't count toward your total, but also causes some form of negative consequence for the characters to overcome. Players may voluntarily reduce some of the dice in their pool to a d4, decreasing their likelihood of success and increasing the likelihood of a negative consequence, in exchange for \\"Plot Points\\" which may be spent in several ways to influence the game's plot. In their review of the game, Steven A. Torres-Roman and Carson E. Snow point out that \\"the Cortex Plus system serves as the engine for several other genre games\\" and that \\"Margaret Weis Productions also publishes the Cortex Hacker's Guide, so players who want to dig into the intricacies of the system can do so more easily and come up with a variety of new ideas for their games.\\"Torres-Roman and Snow, ibid.

The campaign is presented in five interconnected adventures which can either be run consecutively in a single story arc, or as individual adventures. When played as a campaign, player characters get caught up in the mystery of a missing Alliance vessel called the Westlake. Firefly Role-Playing Game brand manager Monica Valintinelli described the Westlake as \\"a ghost ship from the Unification War‚Äîso there's this legendary battleship that's out there, somewhere, in the black‚Äîit's got all these rumors about it.\\" In the course of the adventures, the player characters are able to collect enough of these rumors to set out in search of the Westlake themselves. Ghosts In the Black describes its own campaign premise as follows: > Some folk think that the Westlake disappeared after the first battle of the > war.

SVOM will study the explosions of massive stars by analysing the resulting gamma-ray bursts. The light-weight X-ray mirror for SVOM weighs just . SVOM will add new capabilities to the work of finding gamma-ray bursts currently being done by the multinational satellite Swift. Its anti-solar pointing strategy makes the Earth cross the field of view of its payload every orbit. Objectives Using synergy between space and ground instruments, the mission has these scientific objectives: * Permit the detection of all known types of Gamma-ray bursts * Provide fast, reliable GRB positions * Measure the broadband spectral shape of the prompt emission (from visible to MeV) * Measure the temporal properties of the prompt emission (from visible to MeV) * Quickly identify the afterglows of detected GRBs at X-ray and optical wavelengths, including those which are highly redshifted (z>6) * Measure the broadband spectral shape of the early and late afterglow (from visible to X-rays) * Measure the temporal evolution of the early and late afterglow (from visible to X-rays) Scientific payload The selected orbit is circular with an altitude of and an inclination angle of 30¬∞ with a precession period of 60 days. The payload is composed of the following four main instruments: ; ECLAIRs : ECLAIRs is a wide-field (‚àº2 sr) coded mask camera with a mask transparency of 40% and a detection plane coupled to a data processing unit, so-called UGTS, which is in charge of locating GRBs in near real time image and rate triggers. The trigger system of the coded-mask telescope ECLAIRs onboard SVOM images the sky in the 4-120 keV energy range, in order to detect and localize GRB in its 2 sr-wide field of view. The low-energy threshold of ECLAIRs is well suited for the detection of highly red-shifted GRB. ECLAIRs is expected to detect ‚àº200 GRBs of all types during the nominal 3 year mission lifetime. To reach a 4 keV low- energy threshold, the ECLAIRs detection plane is paved with 6400 4√ó4 mm2 and 1 mm-thick Schottky CdTe detectors. The detectors are grouped by 32, in 8x4 matrices read by a low-noise ASIC, forming elementary modules called XRDPIX. ; Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GRM) : A gamma-ray non-imaging spectrometer (GRM), sensitive in the 50 keV to 5 MeV domain, will extend the prompt emission energy coverage. GRB alerts are sent in real-time to the ground observers community. ; Microchannel X-ray Telescope (MXT) : A spacecraft slew is performed in order to place the GRB within the narrow fields of view of two instruments - a soft X-ray telescope (MXT) and a visible-band telescope (VT), to refine the GRB position and study the early phases of the GRB afterglow. ; Visible Telescope (VT) : A visible telescope operating from 400 to 950 nm, with a FOV of 21√ó21 arcminutes. It will reach a sensitivity of about 23 magnitudes, in the R band, in a 300 s exposure time, at 5 s. Ground segment The ground segment includes a set of three ground-based dedicated instruments ‚Äì two robotic Ground Follow-up Telescopes (GFT) and an optical monitor, Ground Wide Angle Camera (GWAC) ‚Äì which will complement the space borne instruments. A large fraction of GRB will have redshift determinations, an observing strategy optimized to facilitate follow-up observations by large ground-based spectroscopic telescopes. A key elements of the SVOM mission are the Ground Wide Angle Cameras (GWACs) and the Ground Follow-up Telescopes (GFTs). The GWACs, an array of wide FoV optical cameras operating in the optical domain, will permit a systematic study of the visible emission during and before the prompt high-energy emission. It will cover a field of view of about 8000 deg^2, with a sensitivity of about 15 magnitudes at 5 s (under the full Moon condition), in the V band and with a 15 s exposure time. It will monitor continuously the field covered by ECLAIRs in order to observe the visible emissions of more than 20% of the events, at least 5 minutes before and 15 minutes after the GRB trigger. The GFTs, two robotic 1-meter class telescopes (one managed by France, another one by China), will point automatically their field-of view towards the space-given error box within tens of seconds after the alert reception and will provide panchromatic follow-up (visible to near-infrared). They will contribute to the improvement of the link between the scientific payload and the largest telescopes by measuring the celestial coordinates with an accuracy better than 0.5, and by providing an estimate of its photometric redshift in less than 5 minutes after the beginning of the observations. This data will be available to the scientific community through an alert message. Evenly placed on the Earth (one in South America in a place to be defined, the other one in China), they will be in a position to start the research of the GRB optical emission immediately after the alert reception in more than 40% of the cases.

It stars Riz Ahmed, Cush Jumbo, James Floyd, Billie Piper, and Roshan Seth. Set in London, it tells the story of a private detective who investigates the disappearance of a Russian prostitute. The film had its world premiere in the Special Presentations section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on 12 September 2016. It was released in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2017.  Plot  Tommy Akhtar, the son of immigrants, works as a snoop in London. Melody Chase visits him to ask him to look for her missing roommate Natasha, a Russian prostitute. Tommy steals a keycard from the cleaning staff and sneaks into the hotel room where she met her last client but only finds the dead body of Usman Rana, a Pakistani businessman. Tommy takes the dead man's mobile phone as evidence, calls the police with an anonymous tip about the murder from a payphone at a bar, and has the phone's PIN cracked by Avid, a young weed dealer whose mother wants Tommy to help get out of trouble. Two of the last calls made from the phone were to Hafiz \\"Lovely\\" Ansari, a childhood friend of Tommy's, to discuss an investment. Tommy visits him at his home and Lovely asks him to investigate the matter because the murder is scaring away other investors. Tommy learns from a police contact that by the time the police arrived the room had been cleaned and the hotel was crawling with SO15. The SIM card in the phone is decrypted and found to contain a spreadsheet documenting large donations to the Islamic Youth League. Tommy visits the organisation and is photographed doing so by the SO15. The leader of the organisation indicates that Usman's death was the will of Allah as punishment for the false idols and lustful desires of Western society. After leaving, Tommy is approached by an American federal agent in a bar who tells him that he knows that Tommy was at the hotel and that he called in the anonymous tip and warns Tommy to stay away from the investigation. Tommy speaks with Tunde, one of the men working at Natasha's club the night she was last seen, and learns that Melody was with one of her regular clients there the night of the murder. As he leaves he is assaulted by two strangers who scream that the case is closed before fleeing. Tommy begins sending Avid to the Islamic Youth League to gather information. Tommy is abducted in a black van and taken to speak with the federal agent, who shows him a video of Usman calling for jihad and takes him to a crime scene to show him the freshly discovered body of Natasha. Tommy returns to Melody and confronts her. She says that she is being followed and confesses that the customer with her the night of the murder was Hafiz. As they are leaving, a stranger shoots at them from the elevator. They escape to Tommy's father's house, where Tommy looks at the spreadsheet and discovers large profits being made from property acquisitions at low prices. The next day Mullah Al-Dabaran, the leader of the Islamic Youth League, is arrested. His followers protest in demonstrations demanding his release, where Hafiz attempts to calm them. Tommy warns Hafiz that the people from the night of the murder are being killed. When Avid is attacked by American federal agents and put into a coma, Avid's mother blames Tommy for getting him involved. Tommy returns home, where he finds Hafiz and another man holding Melody prisoner at gunpoint. Hafiz confesses to using drug dealers to bring property prices down then allowing the Islamic Youth League to run off the drug dealers to enable him to buy the properties at a low price. Tommy's father returns and shoots the gunman, but Tommy convinces him to not also shoot Hafiz. Hafiz is then arrested. In the closing scene, Tommy returns home to eat with his father, Melody, Avid, Shelley and Emma.  Cast   Production  On 21 April 2015, it was announced that Pete Travis would be directing a London-set crime film City of Tiny Lights based on the 2005 novel of same name by Patrick Neate, who also adapted the novel into the film. Riz Ahmed was attached to play the lead role of a British detective Tommy Akhtar, and Billie Piper to play Akhtar's long-lost love, Shelley, while the other cast would include James Floyd, Cush Jumbo and Roshan Seth. BBC Films and BFI developed the script and would finance the film in association with Lip Sync Productions, Fel UK and Ingenious Media. Ado Yoshizaki Cassuto and Rebecca O'Brien would be producing the film for NDF International and Sixteen Films. Protagonist Pictures would handle the international rights while Icon Film Distribution would release the film in the UK and Ireland.

The first edition was published in 1758, and the second edition, revised by Lennox was published in 1761. It was adapted by Lennox into a 1769 play The Sister, performed at Covent Garden Theatre.  Overview  Charlotte Lennox's novel Henrietta depicts the difficulties and dangers faced by young, unprotected women in the eighteenth century. Throughout the story, Lennox uses Henrietta, the protagonist, to describe problems women faced having to do with men, money and social value in the 18th century. Henrietta struggles to figure out her role in society, and, through a series of events, she finds herself overwhelmed with what society has to offer her. Lennox creates tension and elements of suspense throughout the story. The novel fundamentally uses an idea of romance and relationships, along with independence, to build characters and the plot. In the beginning, Lennox tells us Henrietta leaves the comfort of her aunts because they want her to have an arranged marriage and she wants to marry for love. Her pitfalls and successes give Henrietta likability and show how her character is relatable to others. Henrietta is the heroine and the reader wants her to succeed and find true love. Henrietta can be categorized under the German genre known as Bildungsroman. The book focuses on its heroine's steadfast moral beliefs, while also showing her growth as she develops a new sense of self through her many experiences. Henrietta is also known as a comedy of manners because the satirical depiction of other characters throughout the novel teach Henrietta eighteenth-century social norms.  Author  Charlotte Ramsay Lennox was born in 1729 in Gibraltar. She initially set out to become an actress, but began to write literature after that proved unsuccessful. In 1747 she married Alexander Lennox, an employee of the printer William Strahan, but their marriage ended within about ten years. Charlotte and Alexander had two children, a boy born in 1771 and a girl born in 1765. Lennox published a poem in 1747, called \\"Several Occasions\\". She is also known for composing the first comparative critical study of William Shakespeare's source material, Shakespear Illustrated between 1753 and 1754. Some other popular novels Lennox wrote are The Life of Harriot Stuart (1751), and The Female Quixote (1752).alt=Author and poet Charlotte Lennox - \\"As my readers depend on it, I will always be as witty as I can, as humorous as I can, as moral as I can, and upon the whole entertaining as I can.\\" - The Lady's Museum Lennox is also known for publishing a controversial poem that was published in Gentlemen's Magazine, titled \\"The Art of Coquetry\\", in which she directed young to \\"Employ feminine wiles in order to subdue men to their 'empire'\\", promising that such women will \\"control the world by love.\\"  Plot summary  VOLUME I Pretty and gentile dressed, the main character, Henrietta Courteney, acquires a seat in the already full stage-coach to London. Henrietta keeps to herself at first but towards the end of the ride comes in contact with Miss Woodby. In tradition of romance heroines, Ms. Woodby gives Henrietta and herself nicknames, Celia and Celinda, and declared a ‚Äúviolent friendship‚Äù (Lennox, 9). Arriving at Ms. Woodby's stop, Henrietta asks for help to find an appropriate lodging, so that her friend gives Henrietta a letter of recommendation for Mrs. Egret, a milliner friend. Unfortunately, Henrietta does not have the address and thus misguides to another milliner's house of Mrs. Eccles. Mrs. Eccles takes Henrietta in once realizing that she seems lost. Henrietta sends Ms. Woodby a letter because she realizes she does not want to spend any more time at this place. During the time that Henrietta is in Mrs. Eccles's home, a gentleman becomes interested in Henrietta and Mrs. Eccles seems to encourage the potential relationship. Henrietta is pleased but doesn‚Äôt look into it much. Miss Woodby comes over for tea. Then, they begin to talk about the misfortune of ending up at Mrs. Eccles‚Äô home and Henrietta starts to tell her backstory: about her deceased unmarried parents, her brother being away for school, and her life at her aunt's. Henrietta leaves Mrs. Eccles‚Äô house, and finds accommodation at Lady Manning's. Henrietta trusts her, but Lady Manning is only housing Henrietta to set her up with Mr. Jones. We then begin reading about Henrietta being flirted with once again. With this we learn the man's name is Mr. Damer, who is a known merchant in the city, but also a liar. We learn he is a liar when he introduces Henrietta under the false name of Benson, rather than her real name of Courtney. This man gives Henrietta money and tries to persuade her into a relationship with him, which she is not fond of. Mrs. Damer finds out and she questions her husband who blames Henrietta. As a result, Henrietta receives the name of an adulteress, which shames her and leaves her without money. Also, she receives a letter from her aunt telling her that she is ashamed of Henrietta and thus can no longer consider Henrietta a niece, and that she can no longer live with her. Henrietta then approaches Mrs. Willis for advice about her letter back to Lady Meadows. Along with this, she asks Mrs. Willis for help to find her a job as well as new place to stay. Thus, Henrietta works and lives with Mrs. Cordwain. However, this is short lived as Mr. Cordwain believes that she had stolen his daughter's diamond bracelet. VOLUME II As a result of her conflicts with Woodby and young Mr. Damer, Henrietta feels betrayed and angry towards those who have tried to take advantage of her. Henrietta tries to return to her aunt, Lady Meadows, however she sends Henrietta a letter stating that her fortune will not be restored to her unless she goes to a convent or marries a Catholic. Henrietta then writes a letter back to her aunt, stating that only time will reveal the truth about what had happened. She then goes to Mrs. Willis for guidance and to help her find a job in service. Mrs. Willis helps her become employed by Miss Cordwain, a young lady who is spoiled and struggling to find a suitable husband. She was intended to marry a noble man but her father was short on her dowry and thus the engagement was broken off and she is still searching for a husband. After Henrietta is employed, she accompanies Miss Cordwain to the home of Lord B‚Äî. Lord B‚Äî and Henrietta have met previously at Mrs. Eccles. He immediately takes an interest in Henrietta, trying to talk to her and expressing his feelings. Henrietta knowing that any interaction with Lord B‚Äî would be inappropriate as she is a servant, and the fact that Lord B‚Äî is a possible suitor for Miss Cordwain. He questions why a well-born girl such as Henrietta is now a servant girl. Miss Cordwain sees them talking and she becomes jealous. Miss Cordwain hides one of her diamond bracelets in order to place the blame on Henrietta. Henrietta then becomes friends with Lord B‚Äî‚Äôs mother the countess. She confides in the countess and tells her that the immediately terminated her employment knowing that Lord B‚Äî is a suitor for Miss Cordwain. She then leaves the employment of Miss Cordwain and leaves for London. Lord B‚Äî is conflicted with his feelings for Henrietta as he confesses that he is in love with her but she lacks the fortune that Miss Cordwain can offer. After leaving the employment of Miss Cordwain, she returns to Miss Willis looking for another place of employment. She then goes to the Countess's sister Lady D--, who recommends Henrietta to work for a woman named to Mrs. Autumn. Mrs. Autumn is a woman in her 40s and 50s who is very immature for her age. It is soon discovered Mrs. Autumn has a lover named Languish, who she uses in hopes to make her husband, Mr. Autumn, Jealous. However the existence of Languish is neither confirmed or denied. Mrs. Autumn wants to employ young girl like Henrietta to entertain her girlish fantasies. However, Henrietta finds that she cannot flatter Mrs. Autumn's schemes as she finds her actions ridiculous and childish. Mrs. Autumn asks Henrietta to copy a letter to Languish to test his loyalty, since the letter will be written in another woman's hand. However, Henrietta refuses this task due to the fact that Mrs. Autumn is married and does not want to be a part of her adulterous schemes. Due to this, she leaves the employment of Mrs. Autumn. After leaving the employment of Mrs. Autumn, Henrietta then returns to Mrs. Willis. She is also visited by Lord B‚Äî, who again professes his love for her. Lord B--‚Äôs father the Earl also comes to Henrietta to discusses her potential of marrying Lord B‚Äî given that she has a fortune. In order to marry his son, he wants Henrietta to pretend she is Catholic, so she can become Lady Meadows heir again. As a result, Lord B‚Äî will marry her and she will have her fortune and his title. He suggests that she remain Protestant at heart but in public proclaim she is Catholic. She refuses his offer, as she will not compromise her religion for a man she will never love. Lord B‚Äî suggests to her that she only pretend until she receive her fortune. Lord B-- being a man concerned about appearance, wants Henrietta to appear as a martyr. She then meets a woman named Miss Belmore, who is the daughter of Lady D‚Äî. She then becomes Miss Belmore's servant. It is discovered that Miss Belmore is having an affair with a man named Mr. Morely. Mr. Morely is a married man, however Miss Belmore is convinced that he is in a loveless marriage, so she is his lover. Henrietta does not approve of her choices, but she is paid to be her companion and advisor. Belmore wants to set up a meeting with Morely and announces her intentions to leave for Paris. Belmore wants to write to him, but Henrietta suggest she first leaves for Paris and write Morely then. On their way to Paris, we are introduced to two new characters, Freeman and Marquis Melvil. Melvil is the son of a Duke and Freeman is his companion. The pair is returning to London from Paris until Melvil sees Henrietta and immediately falls for her. Melvil then convinces Freeman to divert their journey, so they can escort Belmore and Henrietta to Paris. Freeman reluctantly agrees but seeing Melvil's interest in Henrietta, allows for the extension to their journey. Knowing that Henrietta and Miss Belmore are traveling with no chaperone, that Miss Belmore is a woman of loose morals, therefore Freeman sees the potential of Henrietta becoming a mistress to his master. Freeman then goes to Henrietta to suggest that she becomes a mistress to Melvil. Freeman suggest this type of relationship since Melvil has feelings for her and he cannot marry her due to status. However, as Freeman is about to speak to Henrietta, Henrietta receives a letter from Mr. Damer. Although Henrietta has been going by the alias of Miss Benson the letter is addressed to Miss Courtney. In this moment, we discover that Freeman is Charles Courtney, Henrietta's brother. He is then happily reunited with his sister, and immediately asks Henrietta to leave the employment of Miss Belmore. Freeman also asks for Henrietta to stay at a convent until he makes arrangement for them to return home. Henrietta agrees to this, and is taken to a convent while Freeman returns to Melvil. Freeman reveals to Melvil that Henrietta is sister. Melvil is overjoyed in knowing that his friend is the brother of the woman he loves. However, Freeman does not give Melvil his blessing to marry Henrietta until Melvil has the Duke's blessing. Freeman's concern is that the Duke will not approve of the match as Henrietta is of a lower status than Mevil. Freeman does not want Melvil to be disinherited by the Duke therefore repeating the mistakes and struggles of their parents. To resolve this issue, they return to Lady Meadows. Henrietta acquires a 10,000 pound dowry. In order to resolve the marriage issue they return to Lady Meadows with Freeman plans to give her 10,000 pounds for her dowry. Mr. Courtney finds out that Lady Meadow leaves everything to Mr. Courtney in her will. However, the dowry the Duke expects is 20,000 pounds which is double the amount Lady Meadows has to offer. Freeman convinces Lady Meadows that the title and status Henrietta will receive is incentive enough to pay the dowry set by the Duke. Lady Meadows agrees with Freeman's suggestion, but the dowry set is too high. Luckily Mr. Damer, helps contribute 10,000 pounds to her dowry. The first 10,000 goes the day of her wedding, and the other 10,000 the day of her aunt's death. Henrietta is able to marry Lord Melvil, and at their wedding ceremony, all that characters in the novel make an appearance. After receiving letter from Mr.Courtney, Melvil presents the letter to the Duke and asks for his blessing. As the Duke read the letter he plans to meet with Lady Meadow and Mr. Damer as well as Henrietta. Being Catholic, Lady meadows allowed the wedding to take place at her house, which after the newly married couple, the old lady, the Duke, Mr. Courtney, and Mr. Damer went out for Grace's country seat. Unfortunately after a few short months after the wedding, Lady Meadows passed which gave Mr. Courtney great joy because her death released his obligations to Mr. Damer.  Style  Henrietta is broken up into two volumes. Volume I contains two books with a total of 25 chapters and volume II contains three books and a total of 30 chapters. Lennox includes a brief and witty description of each chapter as a title of sorts, such as \\"a very short chapter\\" in chapter IX of book two, or a chapter VI \\"in which our heroine again appears very foolish.\\" This style of opening chapters was characteristic of Henry Fielding in the early 18th century. Each book focuses on a specific part of Henrietta's life. In book one, Lennox focuses on Henrietta and her interactions with Mrs. Woodby, along with Henrietta telling her backstory. Book two focuses on Henrietta's life while living with Mrs. Eccles and several characters trying to use Henrietta for her money or her name. Book three starts off the second volume, and describes how Henrietta branches out and finds a job working for Mrs. Cordwain. In the fourth book, Henrietta leaves Mrs. Cordwain because she is getting jealous of Henrietta, and then goes to work for Mrs. Autumn. To wrap the story up, in the fifth book, Henrietta accompanies Lady Belmour to London and meets her brother, Freeman, and her love, Melvil. The novel is narrated in the third person. The narrator describes Henrietta throughout the story to give the reader more insight about what is going on in her life. Throughout the story, the narrator makes humorous and witty remarks about Henrietta and the situations she is in. While for most of the novel the narrator focuses on telling Henrietta's story, when Freeman is introduced in the story, the focus of the narrator shifts to his movements and actions. The author gave context and social cues at the time that added towards the situations in which Henrietta was faced with. For instance, when Henrietta was living by herself, this event highlights the severity of this issue on the fact that living alone today would be much more female friendly now than in time in which the story was written.  Critical Contexts  Charlotte Lennox‚Äôs Henrietta offers a criticism of women and their roles in the 18th century. In a time where women were bargaining chips and their marriages brought needed funds to respectable names of the noble class, women were encouraged to agree to engagements that either brought money or titles. Criticizing the snobbery that occurred between noble names and ‚Äúupstart cits‚Äù who were successful in business, Lennox offers a blank straight character in the titular character Henrietta, who's equal parts pious and respectable, while the characters surrounding her are caricatures of the roles played at the time: Miss Cordwain, for instance, is a haughty woman with little name but due to her father's successful business ventures is able to marry into a respectable family, though her attitude and behavior would be disgraceful if the dowry her father offered wasn‚Äôt so desirable. Miss Belmour is from a respectable family but dishonors her name by engaging in a romance with an already married man. These women are stark contrast to the virtuous Henrietta, who refuses to marry someone with a title, like Sir Isaac Darby, for the sake of becoming a titled woman, if there is no love or respect between them, an ideal that is a novelty among the upper echelon surrounding Henrietta. The concept of religion becomes an important part of Henrietta's story, as her aunt Lady Meadows is adamant about her heir keeping the Catholic faith. Catholicism in England at the time was more of a novelty religion, laughed at by Protestants and considered a rarity. In order to become Lady Meadows‚Äô heir, Henrietta must convert, or, as Lord B- suggests, maintain an appearance of Catholic piety to appease her aunt long enough to become her sole or major heir. Henrietta ends up being put in a convent by her brother while he goes off and sorts her life out for her. She happily stays there waiting for him to call for her. Henrietta offers an unusual view of women in 18th century literature, her wit and common sense are a refreshing aspect of a woman traveling alone, or without counsel. Women of her time had a tendency to be viewed in a way that made it necessary for them to be given permission from either their fathers, or husbands, or male ‚Äòsuperiors‚Äô to do anything. Henrietta denounces the marriage her aunt had set for her, leading her to embark upon an adventure that leaves her relatively penniless, and alone. She knows she has a brother out in the world, but is unsure as to when she will see him. Her decision to go against the family she has, and go out on her own shows a sense of independence not typically seen amongst 18th century female characters. Lennox encapsulates many of the time period's social nuances in a way that probes the reader to think more deeply about how limited women's capabilities appear to be. Henrietta is a poised individual, yet fairly na√Øve, and her independence repeatedly places her in positions of vulnerability, both physically and in the social sphere. In an attempt to make her actions less conspicuous, she utilizes several aliases, however is unable to successfully conceal her identity, which only serves to further compound her shame. Despite her efforts to conform to the behavior expected of women, her resistance to having others dictate her marital status is her most prominent recurring problem. Each time a conflict arises, Henrietta chooses to flee rather than confront it, and only when she reunites with her brother does she cease to flee, instead opting to put him in control of her every decision. While Henrietta's behavior throughout the novel initially seems benign, women's etiquette in the 18th century had many intricate and at times paradoxical rules; although she was not as boisterous as some other women she encountered, her steadfast personal morals made her enemies nearly everywhere she went. That said, Henrietta is a realistic, relatable portrayal of a woman who wants to be considered dignified, but also wants to retain her own personal morals, and struggles to maintain balance between the two. Henrietta is an independent woman that is getting around mostly on her own, despite growing up in a sheltered life where she did not have much to worry about. She is able to observe everything around her, and infer what a woman's role in society is and what is expected of her. Henrietta is concerned about the idea of having to 'marry a man' and does not want to be forced into something she does not want to do. This should not be confused with not wanting to be married at all, throughout the book she is never insinuating she does not want to marry period, but that she does not want to be forced into something she has not chosen. This is an important distinction since almost all women of status were 'forced' into a marriage, whether they were happy about it or not. It was not their choice based on love, it was a usually a choice made by a father or older brother in order to further advance their family, or business. Henrietta is a work of domestic fiction, providing an outline for what is expected within the social realms of its contemporary society. Despite being a novel, it serves as a practical manual for English middle class readers. For example, Book I of Henrietta, which recounts the protagonist's familial trials and somewhat complicated standing within the class hierarchy, demonstrates the struggle of intermingling between classes. Writer and literary scholar Elizabeth Langland argues that given the historical context of these works, a successful romance between a working class woman and a middle-class man is ‚Äúun narratable.‚Äù Such seemingly unbreachable social boundaries are abundant in Lennox's text. There appear to be immediately dismissed by the character's morality, cautioning against them. Henrietta's odd circumstances (being financially frozen, wandering from place to place with no home, yet remaining esteemed as a respectable elite) place her ideally to act as a conduit through which the reader can observe the rigid class divide of England and be instructed how to navigate it. The history of Henrietta's parent's marriage- for-love scandal is a perfect example of the 18th century British obsession with maintaining its cultural hierarchy. Early on, Henrietta explains her father's (Mr. Courtney's) station as elite ‚Äì being son to an earl ‚Äì while her mother embodies ‚Äúbirth, beauty, virtue, [and] every perfection but riches.‚Äù By choosing to marry the woman he loves from a lower social standing, Mr. Courtney condemns his family to economic struggle, as opposed to the prosperity he could have given them if the earl had not ‚Äúrenounced him‚Äù as a son. Even the support Mr. Courtney's mother, the countess, had for him could not change what society had deemed irreparable to his character. ‚ÄúUnequal‚Äù matches were perceived to create chaos and consequently figured in domestic novels as one of the paramount examples of poor conduct taught through cautionary tales; one learned how they ought to behave by being shown how not to behave. Another concept frequently addressed in the domestic novel, and specifically in Henrietta, is duty to family, both older, whose legacy one was to carry, and younger, whom one was to support and endow with what fortune and respect they could. The choice that Henrietta's father makes in marrying a women of lower social standing and sentencing them both to a pauper's life is portrayed as a failure to his family for which Henrietta continues to suffer on his behalf. Hers is a complicated circumstance: a noble last name gives her some social agency, yet the economic misfortune of a lower class mother restricts her and in some cases defines her. Lady Meadows, too, represents a failing here: Henrietta brings dishonor to her aunt which results in their being estranged. While the consequences of Henrietta's choices are often more swift and exacting than those in a real life situation, the progression of cause and effect instructs that every action has a righteous result, and that good and bad behavior are both rewarded in kind.  Themes  = Family honor = One theme of the novel is the importance of family honor and class. for example, Lady Manning's values of family reputation and pride. She accepts Henrietta as one of her own because of her thirst for power and rank. Her goal from the start is to marry Henrietta off to a person of lower rank, a steward, so that she can advance in ranking and obtain more power among her family. Lady Meadows attempts to marry off Henrietta to Sir Isaac Darby because of his class. In the third book, Lady Meadow worries that Henrietta's actions will taint their family reputation, so she disowns her. She values the family's reputation more, and anybody affecting its title would not be recognized. Again and again, characters either pursue the marriage of Henrietta or wish to regulate her decisions. Henrietta successfully evades many of these hurdles by holding to her virtues and values. = Independence = Independence has made the best out of Henrietta's life compared to how other women would view living by themselves. She reacts to living alone quite well. Even though she gets emotional about this, Henrietta is known for using her virtues of compassion, honesty and humbleness into her day to day situation. An example would be when a man in a chariot offers Henrietta his seat. She gracefully rejects his proposition at first since she would not want to impose. Henrietta's parents were not around and able to support her, much like single women at the time were used to. The novel also portrays a harsh view of females, that make them seem dependent on men. Charlotte Lennox removes women's independence and depicts several female characters as romantic (Ms. Woodby), dramatic (Lady Manning), jealous (Mrs. Damer), conniving (Ms. Cordwain), and easily charmed (Ms. Belmont) by male voices. There are only a few women in Henrietta that are not flawed with feminine traits of romantic novels. Women's imprudent actions in the story create a situation that can only be corrected with male assistance. = Bildungsroman = The Bildungsroman tradition is carried though the century with the help of this novel. Henrietta spends a lot of time throughout the story observing her environment and learning what a woman's role in society consists of, as well as how the role of money plays a part in such a society. Several times she is put in difficult situations where she has to choose between her morality or something that goes against what she believes in. For example, she constantly is in \\"fear of being forced to marry a man\\" she dislikes, and several characters throughout the story try to get her to do this. She always chooses her morality over something she believes to be immoral or unethical. This shows that she is very aware of her principles which she develops as she gains more experiences in society. Due to her stubbornness and unyielding beliefs, Henrietta contrasts heavily with her female counterparts who are willing to bend for the sake of their family, reputation, or progress in marriage opportunities. Many of Henrietta's contemporaries are solely focused on marriage, whereas she from the start has been avoiding this. = Comedy of manners = Henrietta is a \\"comedy of manners\\", valuing the appearance characters portray in a social class, and manners consisting of lust, greed, and self-interested cynicism. This is displayed in Miss Woodby's love life, how she is falling in love so fast. On the other hand, Miss Woodby marries a young \\"red coat\\" a week after meeting each other,just so the man does not kill himself. Lennox tells the reader how Henrietta advances from one guardian to the next, such as from Lady Manning to the protection of Lady Meadows. Lady Meadows cherishes the name of the family, and will not let Henrietta's actions defile their families' reputation. Lennox shows how Henrietta's behavior soon causes the development of her independent behavior.  Characters  Henrietta Courteney: Henrietta Courteney is the novel's main character that is a young, beautiful, na√Øve orphan having come from an aristocratic family, finds herself resisting the bonds of marriage despite the alternative until she meets Marquis Melvil in book four.

Knowing that family name and titles are important to her it is important to acknowledge that Lady Manning received her title from her deceased husband. ‚ÄúMr. Manning‚Äù obtained his title by paying for it: which is seen as the lowest and most dishonored way possible. Lady Meadows: Henrietta's aunt comes across as a selfish, superficial woman who values fame and money like other high ranking social women.

She wants Henrietta to marry sir Isaac Darby, who is old enough to be Henrietta's father. \\"My aunt indeed allowed that there was some disproportion in our years; but then he had a good estate, and I was wholly dependent upon her; his person, she acknowledged, was not very amiable, but he was a baronet, and could give me a title\\".

These are the three coelomic cavities that form as separate compartments from the intraembryonic coelom. More milky spots are found on the greater omentum in the peritoneal cavity than anywhere else. The milky spots are made up of mesenchymal cells and are covered in a layer of mesothelium. These structures surround the small blood vessels. The enclosing mesothelium contains macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells. They are also known as secondary lymphoid organs. Most milky spots contain extremely thin-walled lymphatic capillaries. The macrophages are usually located on the edge of the milky spot and the lymphocytes in the middle. Other structural elements are plasmocytes and various connective tissue cells including reticular and elastic fibres. There is seen to be a delicate framework of reticular fibres supporting the structure. Blood supply is from the gastroepiploic arteries. Nerve supply is found underneath the mesothelium. Milky spots first appear in the human fetus at week 26 (becoming apparent as such at 35 weeks) and continue to develop after birth until they reach maximum numbers by the end of the first year. The numbers then start to decline with age. Milky spots are seen as playing an important first-line defence role in the immune system as well as other functions. They have been identified as being an early target of secondary tumors and their response is seen to be possibly of use in therapy.

Plot Al Talcott (Arthur Aylesworth) is released from prison after serving 15 years for helping to kidnap Jimmy Stafford (Kane Richmond), now an adult and in college. The warden assigns FBI agent Farraday (Onslow Stevens) to follow Al, the only member of the gang to know where the still-missing ransom money is found. Farraday suspects that Al's old gang, headed by Tony Bernardi (Sidney Blackmer), also after Al. Bernardi calls Al's old girl friend, cabaret singer Ruby Anatole (Esther Ralston), who does not want anything to do with either of them. Ruby's lover, banker Martin Byrd (Willard Robertson), is going on a year-long second honeymoon with his wife and wants to end their affair. Ruby decides to go to New York and coincidentally gets on the same aircraft as Martin, his wife, Al, Bernardi and Jimmy, who is eloping with his fianc√©e, Amelie Darrell (Toby Wing). Also aboard the aircraft are Farraday, Ruby's traveling companion, Steven Greer (Bradley Page), elderly Fanny Townsend (Julia Griffith), pilot Jim Redfern (Edward Nugent) and stewardess Nancy Rhodes (Barbara Pepper). During the flight, there is a storm and the aircraft is forced to land on a seldom used airstrip near an abandoned hotel. Everyone disembarks except Al, and when Nancy returns to get him, she discovers that he has been shot. The group goes to the hotel, which is presided over by caretaker Mr. Jolly, and Farraday searches everyone for guns, confiscating five revolvers, but none had been fired. While looking through Martin's bag, Farraday finds $100,000, which Byrd claims he is transporting to New York for his bank. With everyone considered under arrest, Farraday goes to the airstrip's teletype office to send in his report. While Farraday is gone, Bernardi steals his gun back and disappears with Martin's bag. Farraday returns and, after sending Redfern in pursuit of Bernardi, goes with Jimmy to the aircraft to retrieve Amelie's luggage. Jimmy accidentally locks Farraday in the aircraft, and when he finally gets out, Farraday finds the teletype operator, dead outside the hotel. Farraday realizes that the murderer killed the operator to prevent him from passing on the last report received from FBI headquarters. Determining Byrd's gun was the murder weapon, however, during a chase, Byrd kills himself. Farraday finds the last message received in Byrd's pocket, indicating he was not transporting funds for his bank. Ruby then confesses that the money Byrd was carrying, was the ransom money Al placed into a safe-deposit box in Martin's bank. Ruby told Byrd about the money, but he was attempting to double-cross her by going to Europe without her. Amelie proclaims that the money belongs to Jimmy, whose family was bankrupted by the kidnapping, and the happy youngsters return to Los Angeles to be married.

History The ship was built by William Dobson and Company in Walker Yard for the Goole Steam Shipping Company and launched on 12 June 1888. The engines were manufactured by the Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company, and she was constructed under the supervision of Mr Sisson, the inspecting engineer for the Goole Company. On 19 September 1898 she was hit by her sister ship Dresden which was inward bound to Goole. In 1905 she was acquired by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. In October 1908 she was in collision with the British brigantine Enterprise of Folkestone, and caused her to sink. All hands on the Enterprise bar one were lost. On 28 August 1912 she was anchored midstream in Goole waiting to enter the lock, when a strong southerly wind caused her to sheer into her sister ship which was outbound with a full cargo of coal. Derwent‚Äôs anchor chain became caught in Ralph Creyke‚Äôs propeller and her engines were stopped. The accident required Ralph Creyke to be drydocked to remove the chain. In 1922, Derwent was acquired by the London and North Western Railway and one year later by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. She was scrapped in 1931 by T Young in Sunderland.

Biography Valery Nosik was born in 1940 to Benedict Nosek, a Pole who in the 1900s came to settle in Ukraine, and 'simplified' his surname by changing a letter. He then married Alexandra Subbotina, a Russian girl from Kashira, and moved to Moscow. Valery's younger brother Vladimir Nosik was born in 1948 (to become later an actor too). As a schoolboy, Valery Nosik attended the Youth Theatre studio based at the ZiL Culture Club, where he was tutored by Sergey Stein. After the graduation he enrolled in the VGIK institute to study in Mikhail Romm's class. Long before the graduation in 1963 Nosik made his screen debut in Knock Every Door (1958) directed by Maria Fyodorova. From then on he was cast regularly, mainly in peripheral, but memorable comedy roles which, according to a biographer, \\"had a way of lightening up even the dullest of films.\\" Only occasionally was he provided the opportunity to demonstrate his dramatic talent, which he did in Horizon (1961), Scrambled Boots (1977) and Shura and Prosvirnyak (1987), to impressive effect. Up until 1965 Nosik worked at the Moscow Young Viewer's Theatre, then joined the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre. In 1972 he moved to the Maly Theatre where he worked up until his death of heart attack, on 4 January 1995. Valery Benediktovich Nosik is deterred at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

The film premiered at the 2011 Vancouver International Film Festival.https://archive.viff.org/e-blasts/viff-2011/2011-10-10-PR.html Plot Sarah Matthews, a creative eleven-year-old girl on the brink of puberty in 1962 suburban Winnipeg, is starved for attention in the midst of her chaotic family life. With a distracted, hardworking father and a seemingly unstable mother, Sarah's loneliness leads her to make a new friend at school. But after meeting his seemingly perfect mother, her own mother's shortcomings become harder to ignore. From the erotic seduction of dinner guests to the bouts of tortured distress in the middle of the night, Sarah grows increasingly concerned and confused with her mother's erratic behavior. As the situation dramatically worsens following an emotional visit to her mentally ill grandmother, Sarah becomes painfully aware of the extent of her mother's own illness. Sarah must force her family to come to terms with her mother's increasing mental instability. Cast *Kassidy Love Brown as Sarah Matthews *Kristen Harris as Beatrice Matthews *Darcy Fehr as David Matthews Inspiration and themes Shelagh Carter's \\"director's statement\\" asserts that as a filmmaker, she is interested in \\"truth in life and in relationships\\", and that she needed to start with herself: > Passionflower is the film that had to be done first as an artist. It is > personal, honest and very committed to that \\"child\\" I was long ago. It is > also a story about loving unconditionally, even if in the film, as in life, > you have no way of knowing what will happen. As a child, she had a troubled relationship with her mother; there was a family history of mental illness going back to Carter's grandmother. In an interview, Carter asserted that Passionflower was her own story, that her experience of her mother is \\"85% of what is seen on the screen\\": > A lot of women at the time, an era of being perfect, staying in the home, > repressed their anger from not being able to express themselves. The mental > health industry at the time made women the problem and treated them with > electroshock therapy. Production =Development and writing= The idea for a film started to solidify when Carter was accepted into the Canadian Film Centre's Directors Lab in Toronto in 2009. > We had to send in two feature film treatments. I had written about my mum > and me and the cat... I had written it as a short film around that time, and > I showed it to my friend John and he said, \\"Shelagh, I think this is > actually a feature, for some reason.\\" Scenes started to come to me, all > kinds of scenes, they were all over the map. To the best of my ability I > wrote a treatment. It was called Hello Darling at the time. I sent it in. > And ... one of the advisors said, \\"You're not ready to do Hello Darling\\" and > one of the other advisors, John Paizs, who I actually knew from Winnipeg, > said, \\"Nope, I think that's the one she should do.\\" I wrote the party scene > and I did a six minute short. It was the first time that I started to think > about it as a feature. On her return to Winnipeg, Carter was introduced to producer and fellow CFC alumna Polly Washburn in November 2009, who read the treatment and said they would make the film. Washburn would talk to Telefilm Canada while she was in Vancouver for the Olympics, assuring Carter: \\"We're not going to worry about going into development, we're going to go straight to production.\\" In January 2010, Carter took a screenwriting course, \\"got a structure going,\\" and sent it to Washburn for editing. > I met with Telefilm in Vancouver, and they knew me from my shorts. I told > them, \\"We're going to make this film out in the prairies, and you want to be > part of it? Because we're gonna make it anyway.\\" I happened to take some of > my drawings, of the Vargas girls, and they loved the drawings. By April, we > submitted it. We had three tough phone calls. By June 1, we had the go- > ahead. Because I had to be back to work in September, we had to film in > August, and that's what we did. It just came out of me. I was ready. I think > I was the only director that showed up at the CFC where they didn't think of > me as a writer. I didn't think of myself as a writer, and that was based on > my mother telling me that that wasn't my thing, and me buying into it. So it > was also breaking that spell. =Financing and marketing= The film was made with the support of Telefilm, Manitoba Film and Music, and the Winnipeg Arts Council. In addition, Carter and Washburn raised US$5,920 on crowdfunding website Indiegogo towards Passionflower, when the film's working title was still Hello, Darling. The working title appears in the film's first official trailer, and was used in notices published as late as early 2011. =Casting= All of the actors were from Manitoba. Carter knew she wanted Darcy Fehr, whom she had seen in several Guy Maddin films as \\"Guy's alter ego\\": \\"I knew he was right and I had to put my foot down. He was busy working on Keyhole and Polly said, 'Well, I don't know if we can get him' and I said, 'No, we gotta have him.'\\" Carter had a meeting with Kirsten Harris and \\"she talked about how much she loved the script\\", asked some questions and Carter made a point of telling her: > I just want you to know that this is not a hate fest, this is not Mommie > Dearest ‚Äì this is about the illness, this is about the truth of how it all > went down ‚Äì so the film has to be honest that way.\\" My mum was a tragic > figure. In the early readings, I could just feel Kristen's intelligence. She > just said to me, \\"I'm going to ask you to trust me. If I have questions, > I'll ask.\\" We hit it off. I just tried to stay out of her way. Several years later, after Kirsten Harris had won an award for Before Anything You Say, Carter's second feature, and playing again opposite Darcy Fehr, Harris said Passionflower was one of the two most memorable roles of her career: > It was the most difficult role I've played in that she was in quite a dark > place mentally and emotionally throughout, so to sustain that took a bit of > a toll (suffice it to say there were some late night calls to my mom!). But > maybe because of that, it was also just so magical. I'll never forget it. The child actors were found through Carter's connections locally, as Carter intended. Even so, through Telefilm, they put the script out in a national call and received tapes from some \\"very serious actors across Canada ... but I just felt I could do it out of Manitoba.\\" > In an earlier workshop, just to hear the script, I invited Kristen, Darcy, > Jacqueline Guertin, Cindy Marie Small and a couple other people to do the > party scene, and I had them riff off of my script. I had them in my back > pocket, although I certainly looked at other actors. One of the questions > was about the children working on the script, especially the little girl in > that scene in the kitchen and how was that filmed? The script was given to > the parents. Quite frankly, they all felt it was a piece of art, and they > wanted to support the story. And Kristen and Darcy really made the kids feel > that all the drama is on the screen, and off the screen, everything's cool. The hardest character to cast was Sarah. Most the children were too \\"theatrical\\", and Carter had in mind \\"the little girl who played the lead in Atonement.\\" One day she turned to a camera man and asked if he knew anyone like that, and he said: \\"Oh! I know someone like that! Here's a picture!\\" This led to Kassidy Love Brown coming in to read the scene about the cat. \\"And she was so true, and there was so much going on inside of her. Polly and I just turned to each other with tears running down our faces\\". =Filming= Some time was devoted to rehearsals during the week before principal photography, which took place over fourteen days, of August 2010, in Winnipeg. The scene with Sarah crying on the floor shot twice. Carter described her directorial style: > I would speak to the actors in the most basic way, always in terms of a > verb. It had to be active. If they needed a little bit more, we would talk > about the conflict, we would talk about the circumstance, we would talk > about the event, and I would really try to keep it as succinct, but loaded, > as possible. I could tell when they would get it and then I would just leave > them alone. There is a scene with Kirsten Harris on a road which takes place in complete silence, which was controversial among Carter's team in post-production. The idea for the silent moment is based on Carter's experience on first arriving in New York City: > When I first got to New York, and I escaped my family, I was walking in > Greenwich Village, 8th Street, and there was a moment when my body cut off, > and I was suddenly in a silent movie. I knew then that I had to deal with my > feelings. I wanted that experience in the film with that character.

It commemorates one of the key events in the process of attaining independence, namely withdrawal of the last Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) soldier from the territory of present-day Slovenia. It is designated state holiday, but not a work-free day. Background Last Yugoslavian army troops leaving Slovenian soil by sea The Ten-Day War, a civil war, started in the former Yugoslavia on 27 June 1991 between the Yugoslav army and the Slovenian Territorial Defence, ending on 7 July with Slovenia's decisive victory and Slovenia becoming independent. In the Brioni Agreement signed by both parties, Slovenia agreed to postpone its independence by three months and the Yugoslav military was allowed to leave Slovenian territory in stages, with a deadline of the end of October. The last Yugoslav army soldier left around midnight of 25‚Äì26 October 1991, the day now declared as \\"Sovereignty Day\\".The War in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1991‚Äì1995, ed. Branka Maga≈° and Ivo ≈Ωaniƒá. Frank Cass, London, 2001 =Date issue= The key event, the departure of the ship with the last remaining JNA soldiers from the Port of Koper, actually happened on the night of 25‚Äì26 October 1991. Therefore, some consider 26 October to be the real anniversary. However, the last two ships that were still moored in the port at midnight were flying foreign flags, and thus constituted foreign territory according to admiralty law. All the troops on board therefore left the Slovene territory as soon as they boarded ‚Äì which was before midnight. History The bill was sponsored by a member of the ruling Modern Centre Party on the initiative of two veterans' societies, and was enacted with a large majority of 70 to 4 by the National Assembly on 9 March 2015. Regarding celebrations, Marjan Dolin≈°ek, a member of the Modern Centre Party, said, \\"The new holiday would be celebrated as day of pride, unity and confidence in memory of what preserved the nation through centuries\\". No official state celebration was organized on the first Sovereignty Day on 25 October 2015, nor is one planned for future years. An open day was organized by the president's office, with the president Borut Pahor making a speech on this occasion. Apart from that, commemorations took place on the municipal level, most notably in Kamnik where the two veterans' societies unveiled a monument to the actions by members of Slovenian Territorial Defence and police force during the Ten-Day War.

Its contents are now integrated with the rest of the collections. In the mid-1970s she and other catalogers worked to start the Library of Congress Professional Guild (AFSCME Local 2910), because they felt that managers were demanding unreasonable quotas of books cataloged per day. In 2006 she became a founding member of Capitol Hill Village, an organization created to help seniors age in place. She was also a founding member of the Hill Havurah on Capitol Hill. Most of her papers are held at the United States Holocaust Memoriam Museum, others are at the Army Heritage and Education Center and the University of Washington Special Collections. The Ruth Rappaport Wisdom Award was created \\"to recognize the work of one individual annually that has displayed remarkable warmth, wisdom, and commitment to the Capitol Hill Community.\\" She died in 2010 and her memorial bench is located in Congressional Cemetery.

The film features Kalaiyarasan along with debutant Rameez Raja in the lead roles. The film was earlier titled Jinn. K. E. Gnanavel Raja, impressed with the film, acquired the rights for the film and renamed it to Darling 2, making it a sequel to Darling (2015). The film released on 1 April 2016 to poor reviews from critics. Plot The film opens with a girl coming to see her parents getting possessed by a ghost. The scene shifts to five friends who plan for a trip to Valparai. Aravind, initially reluctant to go, later accepts to have fun with his friends. They travel together when one of his friends, while clearing up his room, visualizes eerie things but refuses to tell his friends as he would be teased. They all reach Valparai and meet Valparai Varadhan, who gets things done for them. Ayesha, the lover of their friend Ram, brings them dinner. Mysterious things occur, and the friends think that Krishna, Ram's brother, is possessed. Later, when they check the photo taken, they see Ram with them and understand that Ram is responsible for all the eerie things. When they go to Aravind to tell him about Krishna, they come to know that Aravind who is possessed by Ram and not Krishna. Ram narrates the story, telling that Aravind promised him to get permission for Ram from his parents to marry his girlfriend Ayesha. His parents did not accept her as she is a Muslim. Aravind tells Ram and Ayesha to stay at Valparai for few days, and by then his parents would accept. One day, Ram's parents make another arrangement for his wedding, but Aravind calls and tells Ram that convincing his parents can never happen as they dislike Ayesha. Then later, Aravind receives a call from Rafiq that Ram has slit his hands and committed suicide. In order to avoid Ayesha getting hurt, Aravind hides it from her and goes to Ram's house. The scene shifts to Aravind possessed by Ram, who tells that he needs only Aravind to be killed and will never do anything to his Krishna or the other three of them. The friends seek help from Varadhan and try to tie a holy string. After several attempts, they do it and bring Aravind back. They go to the place where Ayesha lived and are shocked to see that she has already committed suicide on knowing about Ram's death. It was her spirit who brought dinner for them. On that day when they are about leave Valparai, they are confronted by Ram and Ayesha, Aravind says that he is ready to die for this friend and says the story. It was Ram's birthday, so to surprise him, Aravind had told him to come to a place. The place is then revealed to be the register's office to get Ram and Ayesha married. Aravind wanted to surprise Ram by giving him a birthday gift, who is going to be Ayesha. So he mischievously lies, telling him that his parents will not accept Ayesha and tells him to stop spoiling Ayesha's life. Taking this seriously, Ram commits suicide. Aravind feels sorry for him and asks to take his life but after forgiving him. Ram says he either has to kill Aravind or needs to live a life through Aravind. The screen goes blank, and after few weeks, Aravind is engaged to the same girl who was possessed in the beginning, which implies that Ram and Ayesha will live together with the help of Aravind and his wife.

After crossing the border the loyalists proceeded to vandalise many buildings in the village and beat up two police officers before being dispersed by the Garda S√≠och√°na. The incident occurred in the context of unionist opposition to the recently signed Anglo-Irish Agreement. Background The invasion can be considered part of the campaign by unionists to undo the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Agreement, signed by the British and Irish governments in November 1985, gave the Irish government an advisory role in Northern Ireland's government. This provision caused outrage amongst the Unionist community of Northern Ireland. Many felt it was a 'stepping stone' towards a united Ireland. They were determined to show their opposition and even reverse the Agreement. All Unionist MPs in the British House of Commons resigned their seats in protest. 400,000 signatures were signed in a petition against the Agreement. A mass rally was held in protest outside Belfast City Hall. On 3 March 1986, a unionist 'Day of Action' shut down Northern Ireland's shops, offices and factories. The homes of police officers were petrol bombed.Tim Pat Coogan (2002). The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal and the Search for Peace. Palgrave. p.233The constitutional issue in Irish politics in David Hill, The British and Peace in Northern Ireland, David Spencer, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 65 Incursion Clontibret is about one mile from the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in the Republic. The incursion took place on the night of 7 August 1986. The number of loyalists that took part is uncertain. Initial police reports stated that about 150 took part.Irish Protestants clash with police, Lewiston Daily Sun, 8 August 1986 This figure was repeated by some news reports on the incident.. One news report stated a figure of about 200, apparently based on estimates made by locals.. The figure of 500 is often stated in secondary sources, based on the estimate that Peter Robinson gave speaking to a radio station from custody. Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and a sitting MP, was the most prominent figure involved. The extent of his involvement in planning the raid and leading the mob is unclear, though the incident has become very much associated with him. Many loyalists took cudgels with them. However, none are believed to have brought firearms. After reaching the village, the mob proceeded to damage property. They damaged cars, broke windows and lights and uprooted small trees. Anti-Agreement graffiti was sprayed throughout the village. Graffiti was sprayed on a wall which, unknown to the invaders, was the perimeter wall of a Protestant church.Living behind the Emerald Justine McCarthy Irish Independent, 14 April 2005 The iron gate of a school was ripped out and thrown onto the road. The village's unoccupied Garda station was attacked, with the Garda sign being stolen. With many wearing paramilitary uniforms, the loyalists marched up and down the village's main street in a military fashion. Two unarmed Garda√≠ arrived at this stage and were attacked by the mob. The Garda√≠ were beaten up, with both of them later being sent to hospital. Armed Garda√≠ then arrived. Shots were fired into the air, causing the mob to disperse. All of the invaders made it back over the border except Peter Robinson, who was arrested. It was suggested in one official report on the incident that Robinson may have deliberately held back to get himself arrested. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had tipped off the Garda√≠ about a possible incursion in the area, assistance welcomed by authorities south of the border.'RUC tipped off the Garda about Robinson‚Äôs ‚Äòinvasion‚Äô of Clontibret', The News Letter, Sam McBride, 29 December 2014 Other loyalist shows of strength were planned for the same day. However, due to RUC activity, these were limited to the predominantly Catholic village of Swatragh in Northern Ireland, where a group of loyalists marched down the main street and caused property damage.'NI state papers 1985/86: RUC tipped off gardai over Robinson 'invasion', Eamonn Phoenix, BBC News, 29 December 2014 Aftermath Although the incident has gone down in history as being quite farcical, it was met with strong condemnation at the time. Government ministers from both the United Kingdom and Ireland condemned it. The leaders of the Alliance Party and the Social Democratic and Labour Party also condemned it. Ken Maginnis of the Ulster Unionist Party was also critical of the loyalists involved.MacBridge (2014). Peter Robinson and the DUP justified the incursion by saying that it was done to highlight the lack of cross-border security, despite reform in this area being promised under the Agreement. They claimed that the takeover of Clontibret proved that no real reforms had taken place, and was thus a propaganda victory for opponents of the Agreement.'RUC tipped off garda√≠ over Robinson 'invasion', The Irish News, 29 December 2014 Peter Robinson was charged under the Offences Against the State Act. He was granted bail and appeared in court in Dundalk in August. He pleaded guilty to unlawful assembly, and was fined IR¬£17,500. The alternative was a prison sentence, which would have resulted in Robinson losing his Westminster seat. He was forced to give up deputy leadership of the DUP but he was later reinstated. The court hearing caused some 'Belfast-style rioting and petrol-bombing in DundalkCoogan (2002), p. 233 between local nationalists and police. Cars belonging to Robinson's supporters were damaged and petrol bombs were thrown. Robinson's supporters had had any items that could be construed as offensive weapons taken from them when they crossed the border into the Republic. Robinson and DUP leader Ian Paisley made a formal complaint about the 'totally inadequate protection' they were given during the hearing. Ultimately, the incident had no effect on the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Agreement went through, despite continuing opposition from loyalists, including the founding of the paramilitary organisation Ulster Resistance. Speaking in January 2014, Ian Paisley claimed that the incursion had been planned by Robinson, who hoped for 'a tremendous uprising'.The secret split with Robinson and the 'beasts' who backed him, Nicola Anderson, Irish Independent, 2014 This renewed speculation that Robinson had really sought to increase his standing within the DUP, and become leader.Anderson (2014). Robinson rejected Paisley's account as a 'failure of recollection'.'Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson: A very public falling out', Rebecca Black, The Belfast Telegraph, 11 January 2014 He claimed that Paisley was initially meant to go and that Robinson only stood in for him after Paisley had to go to a funeral in the United States. DUP sources speaking to the Belfast Telegraph backed Robinson's account, saying that Paisley was among the organisers. References External links * Compilation of news reports on the incident.

The two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival home is owned by the Canadian Crown and has traditionally been inhabited by persons associated with the Governor General of Canada, including the viceroy's private secretary. It has been occupied by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family since 2015. History Construction on the building, which was based on a design by architect F. P. Rubidge, began in 1866 and concluded in 1867. Though intended in the early days to serve as the residence of the governor general's secretary, the cottage was later designated for use by the government as an official guest house for visiting dignitaries. On his arrival in Canada in 1883, incoming governor general the Marquess of Lansdowne resided at Rideau Cottage while waiting for Rideau Hall to be vacated by the outgoing Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne. Other residents included: Lionel and Lilias Massey during Vincent Massey's time as governor general; Georges Vanier, as Aide-de-camp to Governor General the Viscount Byng of Vimy; and Barbara Uteck, private secretary to the Governor General from 2000 to 2006, and her husband, Graham Fraser. Uteck's successor, Stephen Wallace, resided in Rideau Cottage until the weekend of 24‚Äì25 October 2015, when he vacated the premises to allow then prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau and his family to live in the house while the traditional official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada, 24 Sussex Drive, was undergoing assessment for repairs and restoration. Rideau Cottage was designated a Recognized Federal Heritage Building on 3 October 1986. Design Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the structure had 14 rooms on a single floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013. Rideau Cottage is characterized and distinguished by its symmetry, simple lines, classically inspired central entrance with pedimented porch, sash windows flanked by decorative shutters, and paired chimneys.

STOP program  In 1994, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department developed a program called Stop Turning Out Child Prostitutes (STOP). It aims to identify and arrest child sex traffickers and provide an avenue for child prostitutes to live a successful life. It does this by using the following steps: # Arrest - The police arrest the victim. A team of detectives is then sent to investigate the victim in hopes to locate the trafficker. # Detention - The victim is detained through a material witness hold until after the trafficker has been prosecuted. # Maintenance and Protection - Investigators maintain frequent contact with the victim. They explain the process of the trial and discuss what the victim plans to do after the trial. # Court Appearance - The victim gives testimony at court and the hold is released # Aftercare - If a satisfactory home environment cannot be found, the city may use a program such as the Paul and Lisa program or Children of the Night. No statistics were kept before the program, but the police department said that most children would return to prostitution shortly after their arrest. Since the program has been implemented, 9.6% of prostitutes were rearrested for prostitution. They also increased the arrests of traffickers to 380.STOP: Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Vice Section Shared Hope International said that the prosecution of traffickers is strong in Las Vegas, but criticized the city for arresting known victims of human trafficking, saying that victims of sex trafficking often get longer and more severe punishments than other youth arrested for misdemeanors.Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: Las Vegas, Nevada Family Court Judge William Voy agreed, saying \\"These kids don't really belong in juvenile justice but don't fit anywhere else in the system.

High levels of estrogen in breast tissue increases the risk of developing breast cancer and the enzyme aromatase is considered to be a good therapeutic target when treating breast cancer due to it being involved in the final step of estrogen biosynthetic pathway and also its inhibitation will not affect production of other steroids. Aromatase Inhibitors are classified into two categories based on their structure, nonsteroidal and steroidal; the latter resemble the structure of androstenedione. Steroidal aromatase inhibitors irreversibly inhibit the enzyme by binding covalently to the binding site of aromatase so the substrate can't access it. History Figure 1: The steroid scaffold. Base structure of steroids =Collaboration leading to discovery= In 1944 the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology (WFEB) was established. The foundation was the center point of collaboration of many scientists interested in reproduction, neurophysiology and steroid biochemistry. One of the foundations work was the understanding of the mechanism of conversion of androgens to estrogens. The group worked on understanding the biosynthesis and metabolism of steroids that are produced by adrenal glands, testes and ovaries. Andre Meyer later hypothesized that the aromatization of androstenedione was enzymatic and this was proven in the 1980s with the purification of aromatase. In the early 1970s the investigators agreed upon the fact that aromatization of ring A was facilitated by a cytochrome P450-mediated enzyme, proven with the blockade of aminoglutethimide (AG, known to block P450-mediated enzymes. =Harry and Angela Brodie= Harry Brodie, a chemist, joined the WFEB group and started working on understanding steriochemistry of hydrogen elimination at the C-1 position during aromatization. His mechanistic studies led him to recognizing the therapeutic potential of targeting aromatase, in the early 1970s he started the development of selective aromatase inhibitors. The collaboration with his wife Angela Brodie led them to report in 1973 the first series of these compounds. They made systematic structure/function studies on nearly 100 steroidal aromatase inhibitors which led to the discovery of 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (4-OH-A), a potent selective aromatase inhibitor. = Shift towards breast cancer treatment and clinical trials = After the Brodies demonstrated the reduction of estrogen levels in rodents and its biological efficacy with regression of rat mammary tumors, Angela Brodie went to Rome in the fall 1981 to give a presentation about her research. At the presentation was Charles Coombes a medical oncologist who expressed his interests in conducting a clinical trial with 4-hydroxy-androstenedione (4-OH-A) to treat breast cancer. The collaboration of Angela Brodie, Charles Coombes a clinical oncologist, Paul Goss a clinical ongologist and Mitch Dowsett a clinical chemist and made this possible. Further clinical development was made with the help of Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis), (4-OH-A) given the new name Formestane. In 1993, Formestane was introduced as Lenatron in to the market with the indicators for advanced cancer in postmenauposal women, the first selective aromatase inhibitor to do so. Due to the unfavourable characters of 4-OH-A, poor oral bio-availability and unfavourable metabolism, a group led by E. Di Salle and P. Lombardi at Farmitalia-Carlo Erba (part of Pfizer) started working on a new selective aromatase inhibitor. The group designed, synthesized and evaluated a new novel steroid, exemestane. Exemestane went through clinical trials in the 1990s and received FDA approval in 1999, marketed as Aromasin. Indication for exemestane is advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, where the cancer has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. Exemestane is the first oral aromatase inactivator. =Steroidal aromatase inhibitors today= Clinical use of steroidal aromatase inhibitors today is more or less limited to exemestane. Use of formestane (Lentaron) is very limited and in some countries it is not used anymore. Formestane has been superseded by newer and better inhibitors with better oral availability and fewer side effects, exemestane and the newer generation of nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. Clinical use =Cancer= A majority of breast cancers are hormone dependent and most of them express either estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor. That is the reason that compounds that inhibit biosynthesis of estrogen have been researched and are now the standard adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It has been proven that breast cancer in postmenopausal women can be treated or prevented by modulating the estrogen receptors or its ligands and as aromatase is part of the final step in estrogen conversion it is a good target for medicine. Because aromatase catalyses the final step in estrogen conversion, inhibiting it does not have any effect on synthesis of other steroids except estrogen. In postmenopausal women the production of estrogen in the ovaries has ceased. The main source of estrogen is therefore aromatization of androgens produced by the adrenal glands. Estrogen production in postmenopausal women mainly occurs in peripheral adipose tissue. Brain, skin, adipose tissue, normal breast tissue and breast cancer cells have aromatase but estrogen that is synthesised in breast tissue and around the cancer cells have effect on growth of the cancer. Aromatase inhibitors stops this conversion and lowers the levels of estrogen. Treating breast cancer with aromatase inhibitors is only effective in postmenopausal women because of high levels of aromatase ligands (substrate) in ovaries of premenopausal women. By inhibiting aromatase in premenopausal women the estrogen levels are reduced for a short time but it leads to activation of the hypothalamus and the pituitary axis which promote gonadotropin secretion that causes rise in estrogen levels by stimulating the ovaries. A study has shown that cross resistance does not always occur between nonsteroidal aromatase Inhibitors and steroidal aromatase inhibitors. If nonsteroidal aromatase Inhibitors are not working or patients are relapsing, then the use of steroidal aromatase inhibitors could be applied for better results before patients will be forced to switch from endocrine therapy to cytotoxic chemotherapy and therefore avoiding or delaying the side effects and complications of the latter. =Fertility= Aromatase Inhibitors have been used to preserve fertility by stimulate ovulation in premenopausal breast cancer survivors. By inhibiting aromatase in premenopausal women the estrogen levels are reduced temporarily which leads to increased gonadotropin secretion and stimulate ovaries and that causes rise in estrogen levels. Examples of agents =1st and 2nd generation= Testolactone and formestane are 1st and 2nd generation aromatase inhibitors. Formestane was the first selective aromatase inhibitor that was used for breast cancer treatment but it is not in clinical use today. =3rd generation= Exemestane is the only steroidal 3rd generation aromatase inhibitor and it has the advantage over formestane in being more potent and can be administrated orally. Clinical studies have shown that 25 mg/day causes 97,9% suppression of aromatase. { class=wikitable !rowspan=1 Figure 2: Structure of testolactone Figure 3: Structure of formestane Figure 4: Structure of exemestane } Mechanism of action Estrogen plays a major part in the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation in hormone-dependent breast cancer. High concentrations of estrogen seem to promote the development of breast cancer. Consequently, two main approaches to control and block the pathological activity of estrogens have been developed. The first approach focuses on the inhibition of estrogen action by antiestrogens, which interact with the estrogen receptors. The second focuses on directly inhibiting estrogen production by inhibiting the estrogen synthetase aromatase. Steroidal aromatase inhibitors are identified as Type I inhibitors which interact with the substrate-binding site of the aromatase enzyme. Figure 5: Aromatase. Figure 6: Estrogen biosynthetic pathway. =The aromatase enzyme= Aromatase is a cytochrome P450 which catalyzes three consecutive hydroxylation reactions, converting C19 androgens to aromatic C18 estrogens. After gaining electrons from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, the aromatase converts androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol, respectively. The aromatization of androgen is the terminal and rate-limiting step in estrogen synthesis. Recent studies have focused on defining the active site region of the aromatase enzyme and to evaluate the most promising reaction mechanism. Three-dimensional models of the aromatase active region have also been generated, though the exact nature of the structure has not yet been fully defined. Figure 7:General reaction of the conversion of testosterone to estradiol catalyzed by aromatase Figure 8: Catalytic mechanism of aromatase Figure 9: Structure of 17-hydroexemestane =Steroidal structure= Drugs like exemestane and other steroidal aromatase inhibitors have a steroidal structure that competes with the natural aromatase substrate androstenedione. The inhibitor must share important structural features with the endogenous substrate, and as features of the androgens, allowing them to interact with the catalytic site on the enzyme protein. This renders the steroidal aromatase inhibitors inherently selective. Due to its selective inhibition it will not affect the production of the other steroids in the estrogen biosynthetic pathway. =Binding to the active site= The drugs bound to the catalytic site are often metabolized to intermediates which have much higher affinity for the androgen receptor. The binding of the intermediate metabolite 17-hydroexemestane for the androgen receptor is about 100 times that of the parent compound, exemestane. When the metabolite attaches to the active site on the enzyme, the enzyme initiates its typical sequence of hydroxylation, but hydroxylation produces an unbreakable covalent bond between the inhibitor and the enzyme protein. Even if all unattached parts of the inhibitor are removed, the enzyme activity of the aromatase can only be restored by new enzyme synthesis. The inhibitor thereby blocks the activity of the enzyme even after the drug is cleared from circulation, thus having a lasting effect in vivo. There is no need for continued presence of the drug to maintain inhibition, which in turn reduced the chance of toxic adverse effects to the patient. Due to the irreversible nature of the inhibition, the steroidal AIs are often marketed as inactivators or suicide inhibitors. Structure‚Äìactivity relationships (SAR) Planarity of the A ring is very important for the affinity of the compounds to aromatase. As can be seen in table 1, where compounds 2 and 3 show substantial inhibition and also have the same stereochemical requirements. Same effect can be observed with compound 5, with inhibition of 34,6% and its 4-keto derivative, compound 7, with inhibition of 83,3%. These differences in the structure of AIs show the importance of planarity in the A ring for interaction with the active site of aromatase. Important aspect to the binding properties of the compounds is the stereochemistry in the C-5 section where the position of the hydrogen atom can be in alfa or beta positions (pointing up or down). The 5Œ±-epimers exhibit much greater binding properties then their 5Œ≤ counterparts, as can be seen with compounds 3/4 and 5/6 in table 1. These results indicate the importance of a correct angle between the A and B-ring junction for better binding to the active site of aromatase. { class=\\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" + class=\\"nowrap\\"  Table 1: Inhibition of A- and D-ring modified aromatase inhibitors !rowspan=1Compound  Formestan  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 - !rowspan=1Structure of inhibitor  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px  100px - !rowspan=1Inhibition (%) for 2ŒºM  99.1  11.0  95.9  96.4  14.6  34.6  10.1  83.3  8.1  72.5  16.6  17.6 } Changing the D-ring cyclopentanone to a six-membered Œ¥-lactone decreased the binding ability of the compounds. Compound 9 combined the D-ring structure of testolactone and the A-ring structure of formestane but had considerably lower inhibition of aromatase than formestane. C-4 region is important for the interaction of AIs with the binding region and hydrophilic bonds such as hydroxyl or carbonyl bonds in that position can improve interaction with aromatase. Experiments using 3-deoxy steroids, yielded that 4Œ≤,19-diol had the greatest inhibition of aromatase. This is likely the cause of two polar amino acids in the active site and underlines the importance of hydrophilic groups in the steroids for better binding properties. Synthesis The synthesis of steroidal aromatase inhibitors is done with various methods, they all have in common that they are synthesized from a starting point that is the base structure of steroids. With various methods there a various starting point of synthesis, f.e testosterone, androstenedione and other variations of these compounds. The synthesis of Formestane from testosterone is a facile three step synthesis, as shown in figure 2. The synthesis has an overall 23% yield of Formestane. The first step is an oxidation of testosterone with Jones reagent to afford androst-4-ene-3,17-dione with a 73% yield. Step 2 is hydroxylation of androst-4-ene-3,17-dione with OsO4 followed by step 3 with alkaline dehydration of the resultant diols to give formestane. The synthesis of exemestane also consists of three steps, as shown in figure 3. First off, a Vilsmeier-Haack reagent is prepared by refluxing paraformaldehyde and dimethylamine hydrochloride in isopentanol at a temperature of 131 ¬∞C while removing water from the isopentanol using a Dean-Stark separator. The internal temperature of the reagent is then cooled to 10‚Äì15 ¬∞C, before adding commercially available boldenone (androsta-1,4-dien-17Œ≤-ol-3-one). The reaction mixture is then refluxed for 15 hours to give the 6-methylene derivative, 6-methyleneandrosta-1,4-dien-17Œ≤-ol-3-one. Subsequently, Jones oxidation of the derivative in acetone at ‚àí10 ¬∞C gives exemestane in 79% yield after recrystallization. A mixture of 65:35 ethanol and water is used for the recrystallization process.

Founded in July 2015 as The Know, the campaign was relaunched in September of that year with its name changed to \\"Leave.eu\\" to reflect altered wording in the referendum question. The campaign, along with rival organisation Vote Leave, aimed to be formally designated as the lead campaign for the \\"Leave\\" referendum vote by the Electoral Commission; however, on 13 April 2016, Vote Leave was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official campaign in favour of leaving the European Union for the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. In the referendum held on 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union by 51.9% to 48.1%. The campaign was fined ¬£70,000 in May 2018, after the Electoral Commission found that they failed to report at least ¬£77,380 in spending. In February 2019, Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance owned by its founder Arron Banks were fined ¬£120,000 over data law breaches. In April 2019, Channel 4 News found that an anti immigration viral video produced by Leave.EU during the campaign was faked, and that the group appeared to have staged photos of immigrants attacking women in the United Kingdom. History The campaign was co founded by Bristol based businessman and UKIP donor Arron Banks, with property entrepreneur Richard Tice and early financial backing from Jim Mellon. It initially set about bringing together a range of different Eurosceptic groups under the umbrella of The Know. As the campaign was being renamed Leave.EU, UKIP leader Nigel Farage gave a public endorsement at the party's annual conference in Doncaster. Farage later clarified that he backed both Leave campaigns as they targeted 'different audiences.' The campaign was then reportedly refused access to the Conservative annual conference and the TUC annual congress, while being allowed to attend the Labour and Liberal Democrat conferences. American political strategy firm Goddard Gunster was appointed for its expertise in winning referendums. In November 2015, Banks wrote to the Vote Leave group proposing that the two groups should merge. He cited his concern that having two rival Eurosceptic groups was damaging the chances of a campaign victory. On 17 November 2015, Leave.EU held its launch event, according to The Guardian. On 18 November 2015, Arron Banks would have had the opportunity to invest in a Russian gold mine, according to The Guardian, although the deal was announced in July 2016. Nonetheless, gold mine discussions had no result, according to Banks. The campaign has petitioned the BBC, ITV and Sky over their alleged conflation of the European Union with the continent of Europe in their output, which it claimed to be an example of media bias. In March 2016, financial supporter, Peter Hargreaves, wrote to 15 million householders in the United Kingdom asking them to support the leave campaign. When rival organisation Vote Leave was designated by the Electoral Commission on 13 April 2016 as the official referendum campaign in favour of leaving the EU, Andy Wigmore said that Leave.EU would apply for a judicial review of the decision. He suggested that the referendum could be delayed until 23 October 2016 while the review took place. However, the next day (14 April 2016), chairman Arron Banks announced that Leave.EU would not be pursuing the judicial review any further. While the campaign states that \\"according to legal experts\\" it is clear they would win, they have decided that it is time to turn their focus fully towards \\"the real opponents in this campaign: those who are repeatedly trying to scare the British public\\". After Farage was not included in a referendum debate, Leave.EU retaliated by publishing the private contact details of BBC officials and Vote Leave members including UKIP MP Douglas Carswell and former UKIP deputy Suzanne Evans. Arron Banks claimed that \\"facts don't work ... You've got to connect with people emotionally. It's the Trump success.\\" On 1 October 2020, Leave.EU were forced to apologise and pay damages for libel to Labour MP Naz Shah after they made a social media post which accused her of being a \\"grooming gangs apologist\\". In a statement, Leave.EU said that their post was \\"ill-judged and untrue\\" and described Shah as a \\"vociferous campaigner for victims of grooming gangs\\". Referendum spending investigation On 21 April 2017, the Electoral Commission announced that it had launched an investigation into the electoral spending of the campaign group at the EU Referendum, saying that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that potential offences may have been committed. The investigation will focus on whether impermissible donations were taken and whether the group's spending return was complete. Arron Banks said the group \\"...will be vigorously defending\\" the allegations. In May 2018, Leave.EU was fined ¬£70,000 for breaking electoral spending laws by failing to report spendings of at least ¬£77,380 during the 2016 EU Referendum. On 1 November 2018, the Electoral Commission referred Arron Banks and Liz Bilney to the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency regarding the source of money used to fund Vote Leave's activities during the referendum campaign. On 13 September 2019, the Metropolitan Police halted their investigation into Leave.EU's spending during the referendum campaign due to insufficient evidence, on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). They did however state that there had been \\"technical breaches\\" of electoral law by Leave.EU. Later in the month, the National Crime Agency concluded that it had \\"found no evidence that any criminal offences have been committed under PPERA or company law by any of the individuals or organisations referred to it by the Electoral Commission\\" with regards to spending during the EU referendum campaign. They therefore chose not to take any further action against Leave.EU. Data protection investigation Banks's company, Eldon Insurance's Bristol headquarters was also the HQ for Leave.EU. Brittany Kaiser, a former director of Cambridge Analytica has said that when she visited in the end of 2015, she saw Eldon employees staffing a call centre for the campaign. Adding that she thought the staff, most who had never participated in politics before, were calling leads or current customers of Eldon. It was reported in April 2018 that the UK Information Commissioner's Office was investigating whether Eldon shared data with the Leave.EU campaign. Although Banks had previously admitted advertising insurance products to campaign supporters, he stated ‚ÄúEldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.‚Äù In February 2019, Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance owned by its founder Arron Banks were fined ¬£120,000 over data law breaches.

She lived and worked in Germany from 1981 to 2014, and is currently living and working in Western Australia. She has won many prizes and awards, in 1986, the 1st International Ceramics Contest Mino, Japan, (Award with Honorable Mention for outstanding achievement) and the 1999 Premio Diputacio da Valencia; International BiennalManises, Museu de ceramic de Manises, Spain among others. Biography After completing an Art Foundation Degree from University of Salford, formerly known as Salford College of Technology 1971-73, Babuniak went on to Sheffield Hallam University formerly Sheffield School of Art and Design 1973-76 studying under Professor Tony Franks, where she gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in fine art and sculpture, with Film and Photography as subsidiary subjects under Professor Tom Ryall. Vessel 1988 Porcelain, 53cm Private Collection London, UK Babuniak‚Äôs career as a professional artist began in North Wales in 1980 when she was awarded a grant by the Welsh Arts Council for a solo exhibition. In 1981 she moved to Germany, where she has a studio at Gmund am Tegernsee in Bavaria. The 1980s saw the development and acceptance of her work by galleries and exhibitions in England, Germany, Italy, France and in Japan. In 1992, Babuniak exhibited in the ‚ÄúEncuentro‚Äù exhibition with Carmen Sanchez and Lotte Reimers at the Gonzalez Marti Museum in Valencia, Spain. In 1999 she was awarded the Premio Diputacio da Valencia at the international Biennial in Manises. In 2004 Babuniak received the L‚ÄôAlcalaten prize at the international biennial in L'Alcora, Spain. Flying Roofs 1990 Plexiglas, porcelain 35 x 16 x 16cm Private Collection UK Selection for the Chelsea Crafts Fair, London in 1988/89/92/95 brought her into contact with the British Arts Council‚Äôs Contemporary Applied Arts with whom she exhibited in 1994/95 and other collectors including Sir John Makepeace and innovative exhibitions such as at Pulbrook and Gould ‚Äôs Westonbirt School in London. Work was purchased for the collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and exhibited at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh under the curatorship of Amanda Game where it was purchased for the Royal Museum of Scotland, now under the management of the National Museum of Scotland. Babuniak‚Äôs work has been exhibited in Mino in Japan, where she received honourable mentions at international exhibitions, and also in Kyoto. In 2005 she was invited as an artist-in-residence to Shigaraki in Japan and from this followed a solo exhibition, Cross-over, under the curatorship of Hiroshi Kawaguchi at the Noritake Garden Gallery in Nagoya. Hanging Nets, Stainless steel, knitted wire, porcelain 100 x 100 x 38cm In 2008 at the ‚ÄúJunges Porzellan‚Äù exhibition in Selb, Germany, Babuniak was approached by J√ºrgen Sch√§rer, author of Auf den Punkt gebracht and project leader in Meissen, who invited her to become part of the design team of ceramic artists on the project to celebrate 300 years of the Meissen Porcelain. However, following the threat of bankruptcy, a radical overhaul, of the Meissen Porzellanmanufaktur by Dr. Christian Krutzke, saved the Porzellanmanufaktur but resulted in the project being abandoned. Work The earlier years of her career saw experimentation projected from organic forms. These works intentionally never evolved into functional objects, as she rejected function in favour of a greater power of expression. By the 90‚Äôs, the incorporation of other materials such as stainless steel and precious metals, reveals a more transcending aspect of her sculpture, delineating and architectural in tone. View KVII B 2009 Plexiglas, bone china, ink, kimono silk, wire 100 x 25 x 6cm Babuniak‚Äôs work is minimalist, disciplined and reserved, drawing on suburban landscapes where the subject matter is reduced to the essential characteristics. Her use and juxtaposition of apparently incongruous materials: bone china, porcelain, Poly(methyl)methacrylate , fine wire, stainless steel, and paper create tension within the harmony of the pattern. In addition to international awards and plaudits, Babuniak has a following of private and public collectors and publications about her work have appeared in many countries.

Demands of her own career brought a temporary halt to the Studio Galerie which was relaunched in 2009 and focused on the concept of contemporary international artists from Germany and Japan: Christian He√ü, Takao Inoue, Herbert Klee, Albert Lohr, Akashi Murakami, Christine Ott, Angelika Sieger, Georg Thumbach and others. 2001- 2009 she founded and curated ‚ÄúWindows for Show‚Äù in Tegernsee, Germany. This was an innovative concept which brought together six interregional artists who exhibited together for 3 months in an environment not traditionally associated with art exhibitions, but which promoted direct exposure to the public. Babuniak has been a member of the AK68 Art Society in Wasserburg am Inn, Germany since 1998. From 2008 until 2013 she served on the Board, and is still on the consulting panel. In this time, she was instrumental in instigating the exhibitions of Albert Lohr, Christine Ott with Christian He√ü and Stephanie M√ºller. Since 2013, she has been involved in the founding and curating of a newly built, international gallery in Kalamunda, Western Australia, expected to open in February 2016.

Life  The family's surname (erroneously spelled Œ†Œ±œÅœÉŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ∑ŒΩœåœÇ, Parsakountenos, in some manuscripts) derives from the locality of \\"Parsakoute\\" (Œ†Œ±œÅœÉŒ±Œ∫ŒøœçœÑŒ∑). His father, Theodoulos Parsakoutenos, married a lady from the mighty clan of the Phokades, apparently a daughter of the general Bardas Phokas the Elder, father of the general and future emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (reigned 963‚Äì969). Bardas had two brothers, Theodore and Nikephoros. As he carried his maternal grandfather's name, he was probably the second-born of the three. According to Arabic sources, in a battle at Hadath on 19 October 954 Theodoulos Parsakoutenos and one of his sons, either Bardas or the younger Nikephoros, were taken prisoner by the Hamdanid emir Sayf al- Dawla. The eldest brother, Theodore, tried to ransom his father and brother for Sayf al-Dawla's cousin Abu Firas, whom he captured in autumn 962, but it was not until a prisoner exchange on 23 June 966 that the Byzantine captives held by Sayf al-Dawla were released. As supporters of the failed revolt of his cousin Bardas Phokas the Younger against John I Tzimiskes (r. 969‚Äì976) in 970, Bardas and his brothers may have been sent into exile. Their exile probably lasted until Phokas himself was recalled in 978 by Emperor Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) to confront the rebellion of Bardas Skleros. The latter, a distinguished general and Tzimiskes' most senior lieutenant, had rebelled on Tzimiskes' death in 976 and quickly seized control of Asia Minor, repeatedly defeating the loyalist armies. Finally, Basil II's chief minister, the parakoimomenos Basil Lekapenos, was forced to recall Phokas from exile. It is likely that his partisans were pardoned and recalled at the same time. Accordingly, the contemporary historian Leo the Deacon records that in 978 Bardas Parsakoutenos, holding the supreme court rank of magistros, commanded the central Imperial Fleet when it defeated a rebel fleet off Abydos through the use of Greek fire, before going on to disembark his men, defeat the rebel troops on land, and recapture Abydos.

Rickard describes himself as \\"an artist working with digital technologies\\". He uses technologies such as Google Street View and YouTube to find images, which he then photographs on his computer monitor. His photography has been published in books, exhibited in galleries and held in the permanent collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Rickard is best known for his book A New American Picture (2010). He is founder and publisher of the website on contemporary photography, American Suburb X, and the website These Americans which publishes some of his collection of found photographs. Life and work Rickard was born in San Jose, California and brought up in Los Gatos in the San Francisco Bay Area. His father was a prominent pastor and many family members were preachers and missionaries, with a \\"very Reaganesque, patriotic view of America\\", a country \\"special and unique\\". Rickard studied United States history‚Äîslavery, civil rights‚Äîand sociology, at University of California, San Diego, and \\"lost his faith in this family vision. His adult view of America was a land not just of great achievement but also of massive injustice.\\" At age 12 he witnessed his father having a secret extramarital affair, that years later in 1988 he confessed to his congregation. Rickard says this experience prompted him \\"to look for the fault lines in the American dream.\\" He lives in Shingle Springs, near Sacramento, California. Rickard is founder and publisher of the website on contemporary photography American Suburb X, which the British Journal of Photography considers \\"influential\\"; and the website These Americans, which publishes some of his collection of found photographs. His most noteworthy books are A New American Picture (2010, 2012) and N.A. (2013, 2014). =A New American Picture= For his series A New American Picture, Rickard \\"wanted to look at the state of the country in these areas where opportunity is non-existent and where everything is broken down\\", where \\"the American dream was shattered or impossible to achieve\\". It is said that this work comments on United States politics, poverty, racial equality and the socioeconomic climate, class; the use of technology in art, privacy, surveillance, and the large quantity of images on the web. Rickard says A New American Picture is about America and not about Google Street View. He began work on A New American Picture in 2008, whilst working a day job in software sales at Cisco Systems. Rickard was at his computer nightly for over three years, taking 10,000‚Äì15,000 photographs, choosing about 80 for the series. He used a digital camera on a tripod to photograph a dedicated screen that mirrored a second screen that he used to navigate. He digitally manipulated the images to remove Google's watermark and crop extraneous information, resulting in a wide image from the wide screen computer monitor. He cites as influences the photobooks American Photographs (1938) by Walker Evans, The Americans (1958) by Robert Frank, Uncommon Places (1982) by Stephen Shore and American Night (2003) by Paul Graham. The work was first exhibited as part of Anonymes: Unnamed American in Photography and Film, curated by David Campany and Diane Dufour at Le Bal, Paris, in 2010. To mark that occasion Rickard produced the first edition of the book, with the publisher White Press. Its first American museum show was at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 2011. Parr and Badger include the book in the third volume of their photobook history. = N.A. = N.A. is a body of work photographed from YouTube videos, which he began working with in 2008‚Äì2009. The series portrays scenes of violence and crime in urban settings, often filmed on mobile devices. The title of the work is meant to be National Anthem, but is a deliberate reference and double meaning for 'N/A' (Not Applicable) as appears on forms, to signify that he considers many of the people depicted in the series are marginalized. \\"I came to the understanding pretty quickly that social media and the internet put into place a real predatory dynamic, where basically it motivated people to take video of other people to put up on YouTube to get shares, likes or comments.\\" Publications =Publications by Rickard= *A New American Picture. **Cologne: White Press / Schaden, 2010.

Bring Back thy Reign Again Upon the Earth, 1914 by Olive Leared Hockin joined the suffragette movement in 1912. In 1913, after arson attacks on the Roehampton Golf Club and on a house at Walton Heath belonging to Lloyd George, suspected to be suffragette-related, Hockin was arrested, convicted and handed a four-month sentence. Her flat was said to contain stones, kerosene and false car number plates. Unusually she agreed not to go on hunger strike if she was allowed to paint. She was treated as a \\"Category One prisoner\\", and it was said by a fellow prisoner, Margaret Scott, that she carved the chair in her cell. The National Portrait Gallery has a picture of her by the Criminal Record Office, and two pages of \\"Surveillance Photograph of Militant Suffragettes\\", also by the Criminal Record Office, which includes her. Her picture was taken from a concealed car in the prisoners' exercise yard using an 11 inch powerful lens which had been purchased by the Home Office. The secret pictures were required because the suffragettes would distort their faces when conventional mug shots were being taken. The Home Office was worried by the impact of their arson and vandal attacks and they were closing art galleries. Hockin was a Land Girl during the Great War, and later wrote Two Girls on the Land: Wartime on a Dartmoor Farm, which was published in 1918.

Signs and symptoms  Different people are affected very differently by this disease. The main manifestation is fluid-filled cysts that grow on the brain and can cause damage that varies depending on their location and severity. Symptoms may manifest early in infancy, or may manifest as late as adulthood. Symptoms associated with autosomal dominant porencephaly type I include migraines, hemiplegia or hemiparesis, seizures, cognitive impairment, strokes, dystonia, speech disorders, involuntary muscle spasms, visual field defects, and hydrocephalus.  Genetics  Autosomal dominant porencephaly type I is caused by mutations in a gene called COL4A1, located at 13q34 (band 34 on the long arm of chromosome 13). These mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. COL4A1 codes for a form of collagen, collagen type IV, which is an important element in the construction of the vascular basement membrane. When collagen type IV is not functioning properly, the basement membrane is weak and the blood vessel is susceptible to damage from trauma or may burst. Damaged blood vessels in the skull or brain cause cysts to form.  Diagnosis  Though it is only definitively diagnosed by a genetic test, autosomal dominant porencephaly type I can be suspected if the disease is known to run in the family or if someone shows symptoms. CT scanning or MRI may be useful in indicating a diagnosis. COL4A1 may be mutated in other diseases that need to be distinguished, including brain small vessel disease with hemorrhage and HANAC syndrome. CADASIL syndrome is caused by a mutation in a different gene, but may cause similar symptoms. Sporadic porencephaly is another disorder that can appear similar.  Treatment  Treatment for autosomal dominant porencephaly type I is based on the symptoms that an individual is experiencing - for example, treatment of seizures with anticonvulsants. It is particularly important for individuals with this disorder and hypertension to control their blood pressure, as they are at higher risk of stroke. Other stroke prevention treatments include avoiding anticoagulants, smoking, and situations that may lead to head trauma.  Epidemiology  Autosomal dominant porencephaly type I is rare and its prevalence and incidence are unknown. It affects males and females equally.

Ospreay began his career in United Kingdom in 2012. During several years, he worked on several independent promotions, most notably Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro) and Progress Wrestling. In 2016, after being recommended by AJ Styles, he began to work with Japanese promotion New Japan Pro Wrestling as part of the junior heavyweight division, becoming a three-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and the winner of the 2016 and 2019 Best of the Super Juniors. In 2019, Ospreay also won the NEVER Openweight Championship, a title with no weight limits and wrestled several heavyweight wrestlers. That same year, Ospreay participated in the G1 Climax, NJPW biggest tournament featuring heavyweight wrestlers. In 2020, he would make his transition to the heavyweight division. Ospreay has worked on American independent promotions, like Pro Wrestling Guerrilla and, due to the relationship with NJPW, Ring of Honor, where he is a former one-time ROH World Television Champion. Professional wrestling career =Early career= Ospreay cites the three- way match between A.J. Styles, Christopher Daniels and Samoa Joe at TNA Unbreakable as the match that made him want to become a wrestler. He received his training at Lucha Britannia's London School of Lucha Libre in Bethnal Green, London. He made his professional debut at the co-promoted BritWres-Fest on 1 April 2012 as the masked character Dark Britannico, the evil twin of Leon Britannico who was played by Paul Robinson, Ospreay's future tag team partner in the team The Swords of Essex. While wrestling with Lucha Britannia he twice won the Lucha Britannia World Championship. Ospreay said in his interview with the Huffington Post that his nickname, \\"The Aerial Assassin\\", is an allusion to the Assassin's Creed video game series and was a persona he adopted to stand out from other British high flying wrestlers, particularly Pac. =Progress Wrestling (2012‚Äì2019)= Ospreay soon became a regular for Progress Wrestling, debuting for them at Chapter Two: The March of Progress with Alex Esmail in a loss to The London Riots (James Davis and Rob Lynch). His performance earned him a place in the Natural Progression Series I tournament, aimed at scouting and showcasing new wrestlers. He lost in the first round to eventual winner Mark Andrews in November and again in a rematch the following May. Andrews who, as part of his reward for winning, picked Ospreay to enter the following Natural Progression Series tournament. The two met again in January 2014 in the first round of the Progress Tag Team Championship tournament, with FSU (Andrews' team with Eddie Dennis) defeating The Swords of Essex (Ospreay's team with Paul Robinson). In his Natural Progression Series II opening match, his opponent Zack Gibson tried to win by holding the ropes. Robinson prevented Gibson using the ropes, which in turn distracted the referee for long enough for Gibson to low-blow Ospreay and make Ospreay submit. On 18 May, The Swords of Essex were one of the final two teams standing in a four-team elimination match to decide contenders to the Progress Tag Team Championship. During the match, Ospreay, having been isolated for some time, reached out to tag his partner but Robinson jumped off the apron and walked out on Ospreay. Ospreay was left on his own and lost the match, after which the Progress Champion Jimmy Havoc came to the ring and ordered London Riots to tie Ospreay. Havoc pulled out a knife and threatened to torture Ospreay, blaming it on Ospreay's popularity with the fans, before other wrestlers came out and intervened, freeing Ospreay. Havoc and The London Riots formed an allegiance known as Regression, which also featured Robinson. On 27 July, Ospreay entered the eight-man, staggered entry elimination Thunderbastard match, the winner of whom can pick a time for a Progress Championship match. Ospreay entered the match third and was immediately low- blowed by Robinson, who had already entered, who disqualified himself in the hopes of taking out Ospreay. Ospreay recovered and eventually eliminated Marty Scurll last to win Thunderbastard. The following show saw Ospreay team up with FSU and Noam Dar in an eight-man tag team match with FSU and Havoc's respective titles, Ospreay's title contendership and everyone else's Progress contracts at stake, depending which individual lost. During the match, Ospreay moonsaulted from the Electric Ballroom's balcony onto his opponents, on the floor. Later, he had Havoc in position to be pinned but as he jumped from the top rope, Robinson dragged Havoc outside, leading Ospreay to pin Davis and end the London Riots' contract with Progress. At the next event, Ospreay defeated Robinson and announced he would invoke his Thunderbastard right to challenge for Havoc's championship at the following show. He lost the championship match in January after Havoc loosened the top rope, making it more difficult for Ospreay to do high-flying moves, and used it as a weapon. During the Spring Bank Holiday weekend, Ospreay defeated El Ligero, Mark Haskins, Roderick Strong and Zack Sabre, Jr across two days to win the first Super Strong Style 16 tournament and once again lay claim to Havoc's championship. Their rematch took place on 26 July in a no disqualification match where the reinstated London Riots neutralised the threat of Robinson's interference and Ospreay ended Havoc's 609 day reign to become Progress Champion. Ospreay successfully defended his title against the 2015 Thunderbastard Haskins and then Robinson. Robinson attacked Ospreay after losing to him, but Ospreay was saved by a returning Mark Andrews. Ospreay went on to finally beat Andrews to defend his title. Ospreay also headlined Progress' first main show outside of London in Manchester, in a triple threat match against Zack Gibson and Morgan Webster to close out 2015. He lost the championship on 24 January 2016 to Marty Scurll when the referee stopped the match as Ospreay had passed out while being handcuffed in Scurll's chickenwing submission. Ospreay lost a rematch with Scurll at WrestleCon Supershow in Texas, USA in April and also lost a contendership match against Haskins on 31 July. He spent the rest of the year in showcase matches against non-regular Progress wrestlers, losing to Zack Sabre Jr., Shane Strickland, Matt Riddle and Adam Cole. Finally on 30 December, at a card composed exclusively of unannounced matches, Ospreay lost to Havoc. After the match Havoc invited Ospreay to join him in his fight against British Strong Style, who held the World and Tag Team Championship. Ospreay instead attacked Havoc and then realigned with Swords of Essex partner Paul Robinson. Ospreay attacked Havoc again, during the latter's Progress World Championship match leading to a Fans Bring The Weapons match in March. During the match, Ospreay challenged Havoc to put their Progress contracts at stake before losing the match and leaving the promotion. Ospreay returned at the last event of 2017 as a mystery opponent for Progress Champion Travis Banks, however he lost the match. On chapter 61, Ospreay defeated Adam Brooks, this was his first victory in the promotion since losing the Progress Championship in 2016. At Progress Chapter 66, Ospreay defeated Mark Haskins. On 7 May 2018, day 3 of the 2018 Super Strong Style 16 tournament, Ospreay challenged Jimmy Havoc to a match at Wembley Arena on September 30, 2018, but was forced to withdraw due to contractual obligations with New Japan Pro- Wrestling. The match was then set for Chapter 75, with Ospreay emerging victorious in a no disqualification, 2 out of 3 falls match with former tag team partner Paul Robinson as referee. At Chapter 82: Unboxing Live, Ospreay and Paul Robinson defeated Aussie Open (Kyle Fletcher & Mark Davis) to become the Progress Tag Team Champions. =United Kingdom independent circuit (2012‚Äì2017)= Ospreay has regularly wrestled for International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW: UK) since September 2012 in singles matches, with Robinson as Swords of Essex and with Tom Dawkins as Spitfire Britannia, playing off their alter egos Pure Britannico and Neo Britannico for Lucha Britannia. Ospreay made it through to the final of the UK Super 8 tournament in both 2014 and 2015, losing to Zack Sabre, Jr and Rampage Brown respectively. He won the 30 man Battle Royale 2014 in April but failed to win it the following year when the All England Championship was on the line. On 28 March 2016, Ospreay lost a Loser Leaves Town match to his former Spitfire Britannia partner Dawkins. The Swords of Essex began wrestling for Future Pro Wrestling (FPW) in May 2013 and after a series of wins became the first FPW Tag Team Champions after winning a four-way match. They held the titles for nine months and eventually became embroiled in a Best of Four match series against both The London Riots and The Alpha Males (Iestyn Rees & Charlie Garrett) for the FPW Tag Team Championship. The Swords of Essex failed to win a match in the series, with Ospreay wrestling the final match, which also had the London Riots' IPW:UK and New Generation Wrestling Tag Team Championship on the line, without Robinson. Ospreay has been unable to replicate similar success as a singles wrestler, twice entering the Zero G tournament but failing to win. Ospreay also became a regular for Southside Wrestling Entertainment (SWE) from March 2014 onwards. After failing to win the Speed King Championship from Kay Lee Ray in a co-promoted show with Combat Zone Wrestling in October, he won it a fortnight later in a Six-Way Elimination match. He defended it over the following months to many SWE and guest wrestlers, eventually putting it on the line in the annual Speed King Tournament where he beat Mark Andrews in the semi-final in a Best of Three falls match but lost the title to El Ligero in a Six-Way Elimination match on 30 May 2015. The following March he unsuccessfully challenged Joseph Connors for the SWE Heavyweight Championship but on 7 August won the Speed King championship for the second time from Andrew Everett. On 27 August 2016 Ospreay posted a Facebook live video unveiling a new British Triangle Championship with his three Swords of Essex partners Paul Robinson, Jerry Sevanchez, and Scott Wainwright. They announced that the trios championships were not specific to any promotion and could therefore be defended anywhere.

He soon started appearing in tag matches with Paul Robinson as The Swords of Essex and, after earning contendership with a win over The London Riots, won the British Tag Team Championship on 15 June 2013 during RevPro's first show at York Hall by defeating Project Ego (Kris Travis and Martin Kirby). After losing to Ricochet in a singles match, The Swords of Essex lost their British Tag Team Championship to Ricochet and his partner Rich Swann, The Inner City Machine Gun on 15 March 2014. On 19 October, Ospreay beat Josh Bodom for the British Cruiserweight Championship in a match that also included Swann. The day before, he had lost a match to Matt Sydal and so in May 2015 the two had a rematch. Although Ospreay won the rematch, with their series at 1‚Äì1 the two were booked in a Best of Three Falls match with the British Cruiserweight Championship on the line.

The following day, on 3 October 2015 he lost to New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Kazuchika Okada. Okada, impressed with Ospreay, went on to recommend him to NJPW officials. This, along with endorsements from AJ Styles and Hiroshi Tanahashi, eventually led to Ospreay being signed by NJPW. In 2016 Ospreay beat Scurll and the new Cruiserweight Champion Pete Dunne in a non-title triple threat match, as well as beating Mike Bailey, which saw him earn a Cruiserweight Championship match against Dunne on 10 July which he won. The following month Ospreay headlined York Hall in a match against Vader. The feud began after Vader had criticised an NJPW Best of the Super Juniors match between Ospreay and Ricochet in May, comparing the match to \\"a gymnastics routine\\".

Soame was his great-grandson, second son of Stephen Soame of Little Thurlow; his mother was Mary Dynham, daughter of Sir John Dynham of Borstall, who had previously been married to Lawrence Banastre. He was admitted a fellow commoner of St John's College, Cambridge in 1660. Soame was High Sheriff of Suffolk in 1672‚Äì3.

Sir Samuel was a relation, being a grandson of Stephen Soame. He was also an opponent of the court, and Soame sent in a double electoral return when Sir Samuel stood as candidate, against Lionel Tollemache (courtesy title Lord Huntingtower), one return discounting many of his supporters. The matter was pursued vigorously through the courts, as a vendetta, by Sir Samuel Barnardiston, even after Soame's death against his widow. Soame was knighted in 1674.
