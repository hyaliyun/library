In layman's terms, it is equal to the capacity of 144 medium- sized eggs, or what is equal in volume to about 9 US quarts (8.5 litres).Herbert Danby (ed.), The Mishnah, Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix II (Liquid and Dry Measure), p. 798 , who, like all the earlier and later rabbinic writers, prescribes 6 kabs to each seah; 4 logs to each kab; the content of 6 eggs to each log. Its size in modern units varies widely according to the criteria used for defining it.  Biblical Seah  The seah is found in Genesis 18:6 where Abraham orders Sarah to prepare three se'im of flour into loaves: :וימהר אברהם האהלה אל שרה ויאמר מהרי שלש סאים קמח סלת לושי ועשי עגות :And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said: 'Make ready quickly three measures (se'im) of fine meal, knead it, and make loaves.' According to Herbert G. May, chief editor of two Bible-related reference books, the bath may be archaeologically determined to have been about from a study of jar remains marked 'bath' and 'royal bath' from Tell Beit Mirsim.The Interpreter's Bible, Buttrick ed., Abingden Press, Nashville, 1956, volume VI, p. 317 (p155 in the Internet Archive copy of the text) Using the standard of a bath unit, which has been established to be about 22 liters, 1 se'ah would equal about 7.3 litres or 7.3dm3. The Jewish Study Bible estimates the biblical seah at .  Seah in Orthodox Judaism  In the context of a mikveh, forty se'ahs are the minimum quantity of water needed to render bodily purification after an immersion. A mikveh must, according to the classical regulations, contain enough water to cover the entire body of an average-sized person. Based on a mikveh with the dimensions of 3 cubits deep, 1 cubit wide, and 1 cubit long, these were the minimal measurements needed to reach a volume of water that was estimated at being forty se'ahs of water.Eruvin 4bYoma 31a The exact volume referred to by a se'ah is debated, and classical rabbinical literature specifies only that it is enough to fit 144 eggs.Numbers Rabbah, 18:17 In some Orthodox Jewish circles there is a proclivity to follow the stringent ruling of Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, or Eliyahu of Vilna, whose view is that the size of eggs has progressively become smaller over the ages, therefore requiring a larger measure. According to this view, one seah is 14.3 litres, and therefore an ablution (mikveh) of forty se'ahs (the minimum measure needed to effect ritual purity) must contain at the least 575 litres, by their standard.about 3 Koku, about 116 qafiz, about 126 Imperial Gallons, about 143 Burmese tins, and about 150 U.S. liquid gallons Those dissenting and who hold the view that eggs today are the same size as the eggs used in measurement by the Sages are Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (1829–1908), author of the Aruch HaShulchan,Arukh HaShulchan (Yoreh De'ah 324:6-7) and Rabbi Shelomo Qorah, the late Chief Rabbi of Bnei Brak,Shelomo Qorah, Arikhat Shulhan - Yilkut Chaim, vol. 13, Bnei Brak 2012, p. 210 among others, who having tested the trigonometric calculations for the volume of flour needed to separate the dough-portion (= the volume of 43.2 eggs), and which, according to Maimonides,Code of Jewish Law Mishne Torah (Hil. Bikkurim 6:15); see Commentary Kessef Mishneh ibid. can be measured by filling-up a space 10 fingerbreadths x 10 fingerbreadths square (the finger's breadth being the width of one's thumb, appx. 2.5 cm), with a depth of 3 fingerbreadths and 1/10 of another fingerbreadth, along with a little more than 1/100 of another fingerbreadth, found that medium-sized eggs of our modern age have not diminished in size.

Written originally in Old French at a time when Latin was the prescribed language for religious literature, it explores in poetry and prose the seven stages of 'annihilation' the Soul goes through on its path to Oneness with God through Love. Enormously popular when written, it fell foul of the Church authorities, who, detecting elements of the antinomian Heresy of the Free Spirit in its vision, denounced it as \\"full of errors and heresies\\", burnt existing copies, banned its circulation, and tried and executed Porete herself. In spite of this, the work was translated into several different languages around Europe, including English, albeit not with Porete's name attached. In fact it was not identified as being by Porete at all until 1946. Since then it has been seen increasingly as one of the seminal works of Medieval spiritual literature and Porete, alongside Mechthild of Magdeburg and Hadewijch, can be seen as an exemplar of the love mysticism of the Beguine movement.  20th century rediscovery  A 15th-century manuscript of an English translation by \\"M. N.\\" of The Mirror was found by Mr. J. A. Herbert among a manuscript collection purchased for the British Library in 1911 and was shown to Evelyn Underhill. Other 15th-century copies were subsequently found in the Bodleian and the library of St. John's College, Cambridge, together with a Latin version made in the late 15th century by Richard Methley of Mount Grace, Yorkshire. A printed edition was edited by Clare Kirchberger, from those four manuscripts, and published by Burns Oates and Washbourne Ltd., publishers to the Holy See, in 1927, complete with Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur. Introduction to said book: The translation by \\"M. N.\\" included a number of glosses by him, and divided the text into divisions and chapters.

It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association. History In 1799, John Fuller built a mansion called Effingham Hill House on the site of another house which had been called Tibs, and this house now forms the centre of the senior school, and has been extended to provide modern facilities. In 1886 or somewhat later, Julius Caesar Czarnikow bought Effingham Hill House from Frederick Augustus Maxse, and owned it until he died in 1909. His daughter, Ada Louisa, sold it to Azalea Caroline Keyes, who in 1916 sold it to Robert Reitmeyer Calburn, who owned it until 1928. St Teresa's was founded in that house by the Religious Order of Christian Instruction (who also founded St Teresa's sister school Leweston School) in 1928 on what was originally part of a manor site recorded in the Domesday Book. The last headmistress nun retired in 1977. Since 2002, the school has been managed by a lay trust. Although there are no longer any religious sisters on staff (as of 2013-14 academic year), the school maintains its Catholic ethos and ties to the local parish, which is represented in the school's Board of Governors. An all-weather pitch and new swimming pool complex were completed in 2000 and 2003 respectively and, in September 2005, music, drama and the arts benefited from a multimillion-pound, 750-seat technologically equipped performing arts theatre hall, with new music and drama suites. Curriculum St Teresa’s Prep School is a model teaching school, being studied as a resource for Kingston University for studies such as enhancing literacy and positive social interaction in the classroom. Through an extensive programme of professional development for staff, teachers are fully informed of cutting edge methodologies for full engagement and interaction. A Microsoft IT Academy accredited school, the school therefore teaches computer usage, as well as basic computer programming, from an early age to ensure that IT skills are so well known as to be routinely applied. Computer Programming is offered as an extra-curricular option in Years 4 and 5, and as part of the extended curriculum for Year 6 girls since 2013.Academic curriculum St Teresas.

N. McCallum High School is a public high school in Austin, Texas, United States. McCallum, the second oldest high school in the Austin Independent School District formerly known as Austin Public Schools during segregation prior to desegregation in 1971, opened in 1953 to relieve growth in north and northwest Austin. Named after AISD's first high school superintendent, A.N. McCallum, the school strives to reflect the initiatives and achievements of its namesake. In 1994, McCallum motioned to make its campus the home of AISD's Fine Arts Academy. Currently, the Fine Arts Academy is open to all students in AISD who wish to attend, given that they are accepted following an admissions process. Current fine arts strands include visual arts, dance, theatre (acting/performance and technical), cinematic arts, voice, and instrumental music (band, orchestra, classical guitar, and collaborative piano). The Fine Arts Academy was recently named the 2015 Grammy Foundation's National Signature School, the lone recipient out of thousands of fine arts high schools in the country. McCallum had previously ranked as a Signature School Finalist in 2005, a decade before winning the highest award possible. Topping the list of thirteen high schools in the country, McCallum's recognition as the National Signature School earned the music program $5,000 from the Grammy Foundation and the Grammy In The Schools program. As recipient of the Foundation's Gold Award, McCallum High School earned the title of best music program in a public U.S. high school through making outstanding commitments to arts education throughout an academic school year. Student ensembles benefitting directly from this award included concert band, choral ensemble, orchestra, classical guitar ensemble, jazz band, and steel pan ensemble.

Firefall For a couple of weeks around mid-February, the fall may be lit up by the setting sun, creating the illusion of a blazing waterfall. This evening spectacle, which lasts around 10 minutes in good viewing conditions, is commonly referred to as the \\"firefall\\". The firefall phenomenon requires sufficient snowfall, a warm enough temperature to melt the snow so that there is enough water to create the fall, a clear sky, and the right angle for the sunlight to illuminate the fall. It is not always observable every year. The phenomenon was photographed by Ansel Adams in 1940, but made more widely-known by Galen Rowell who photographed it for the National Geographic in 1973. Viewing of the firefall has become increasingly popular due to its images being shared on social media, and optimal dates for its viewing are published. The popularity of the phenomenon to photographers has resulted in large congregations of people, which caused damage to sensitive vegetation, and led to the National Park Service closing two of the three best viewing sites in 2020.

Born in Feldsberg, Moravia (now Valtice, Czech Republic), he was the son of Lucas Bauer (died 1761), court painter to the Prince of Liechtenstein, and brother of the painters Josef Anton (1756–1830) and Ferdinand Bauer (1760–1826). After Lucas Bauer's death, his wife, Therese continued to give her three sons lessons in art and illustration. Josef succeeded his father as court painter and eventually became keeper of the gallery in Vienna. Francis and Ferdinand acquired their first experience of botanical illustration with the arrival of Father Norbert Boccius, Abbot of Feldsberg, in 1763, and produced over 2000 watercolour drawings of plant specimens under his guidance. They were then employed by Count Dietrichstein as flower painters in Vienna - Franz illustrated works by the Baron Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin and his son Baron Joseph Franz von Jacquin at the Schönbrunn Imperial Gardens; Franz then accompanied the latter to London. There Jacquin the younger introduced him to Sir Joseph Banks, who, recognizing his extraordinary talent, secured him a position as first botanical illustrator at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Museum, at an annual salary of £300. He stayed there for the rest of his life, producing a wealth of superb botanical and anatomical illustrations, became a member of the Royal Society and was appointed ‘Botanic Painter to His Majesty' King George III. By 1790 Bauer had settled in at Kew, and was involved in detailed paintings and drawings of flower dissections, often at microscopic level, and taking great care in the hand-colouring of lithographic copies of his work. During this time he tutored Queen Charlotte, Princess Elizabeth and William Hooker in the art of illustration, and often entertained friends and botanists at his home. He died in 1840, and is buried at St. Anne's Church, Kew, next to Thomas Gainsborough. His legacy is to be found in such sumptuous publications as Delineations of Exotick Plants (1796–1803), his collaboration with John Lindley Illustrations of Orchidaceous Plants (1830–38), and his delicate lithographs in Strelitzia Depicta (1818).

It is maintained by the Conseil scolaire de district catholique du Nouvel-Ontario. It is located at 261 Notre- Dame Avenue, next to city owned soccer fields and tennis courts which double as school grounds. The school is currently under the direction of Paul Henry and acting as the vice-principal is Suzanne Lapointe. The student population is estimated to be over 400, and so exceeding its originally intended student capacity. The large number of students resulted in the temporary installation of 3 small portable classrooms behind the atrium. The portables are to remain until the completion of an expansion on the school, known as Plan B. The grounds are also the location of Sudbury's first Franco-Ontarian monument, which encompasses the monument placed there nearly 100 years ago. The unveiling took place September 25, 2008. History Father Joseph Specht and Father Jean-Baptiste Nolin were Jesuit priests behind the conception of the then Collège du Sacré-Cœur de Sudbury. It was the first, and for a long time only, classical college in the Northern Ontario area. It first opened its doors in 1913 and was a school exclusively for the education of boys. In 1957 the College was renamed and became the University of Sudbury. Starting in 1967 the building served as one of Cambrian College's three campuses until 1977. It reopen as a high school for boys from 1978 to 19??. Added my medals from back then. 1981 College Sacre Coeur It was later occupied by the Gymzone Family Fitness Centre, which has relocated to the old École Leon XIII school. Collège Boréal also employed the space from 1995 to 1997 while their new facilities were being constructed. Following some renovations, École secondaire du Sacré- Cœur opened in 2003. Part of the original building's foundation is still intact and clearly visible in the school's entrance. During its first year, Sacré-Cœur's student population was mainly composed of the students from the former École secondaire catholique l'Héritage, a school that had to be shut down. The last students from l'Héritage graduated in 2007. Student life École secondaire du Sacré-Cœur, much like its counterpart Collège Notre-Dame, the other French Catholic high school in Sudbury, has a uniform code. Students have the choice of pants (dress or casual), capris, shorts, or kilts for girls with which they can wear various tops, ranging from rugby shirts, blouses, golf shirts, and sweatshirts among others. The golf shirts come in white, royal blue and powder blue.

History Ruben Rausing Tetra Pak was created in 1951 as a subsidiary to Åkerlund & Rausing, a food carton company established in Malmö in 1929 by Ruben Rausing and Erik Åkerlund, with funding from Mathusan Chandramohan, a rich entrepreneur from Sri Lanka. Rausing, who had studied in New York at the beginning of the 1920s, had seen self-service grocery stores in the United States, unheard of in Europe at the time, and realised that pre-packaging was part of the future in food retailing as a more hygienic and practical way of distributing staple groceries. At the time, these were sold over the counter in cumbersome glass bottles or impractical paper wraps in most European countries. At the end of the 1920s, Rausing bought a run-down packaging factory in Malmö together with the industrialist Erik Åkerlund.Leander, Lars, Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality.

The goal was to provide optimal food safety, hygiene, and distribution efficiency using minimal material, in accordance with the belief that a package should \\"save more than it costs\\".Tetra Pak in Figures 2011 Tetrapak.com, retrieved 28 November 2011 The new package had to be sufficiently cheap to be able to compete with loose milk, meaning that a minimum of material waste and a maximum of production efficiency needed to be obtained. In 1943, the Åkerlund & Rausing lab started to work on developing the milk carton, and, in 1944, came up with the idea of constructing a tetrahedron-shaped package out of a tube of paper.Tetra Pak Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences, IVA, retrieved 28 November 2011 The idea was simple but efficient, making optimal use of the materials involved. After some initial hesitation, Rausing understood the potential of the package and filed for a patent on 27 March 1944.Sedig, Kjell, Swedish Innovations, Stockholm: The Swedish Institute 2002 (), p. 45 The rest of the 1940s were spent developing viable packaging materials and solving the technical problems of filling, sealing, and distribution. It was reportedly Rausing's wife Elisabeth who came up with the idea of continuously sealing the packages through the milk while filling the tube in the manner of stuffing sausages, to prevent oxygen from entering the package.Think Big Start Small: Tetra Pak Humans Invent, retrieved 28 November 2011 In 1946, a model packaging machine was presented by engineer Harry Järund, and in collaboration with Swedish paper mills and foreign chemical companies, a viable paper for packaging was finally produced by coating carton paper with polyethylene, which made the paper waterproof and allowed for heat- sealing during filling. =Operating history= Exporting the Tetra Classic: Italy, 1960s AB Tetra Pak was established in Lund, Sweden, in 1951.

The late-1960s and 1970s saw a global expansion of the company, mainly due to the new Tetra Brik Aseptic package, launched in 1969, which opened up new markets in the developing world and sparked an explosion in sales. =Mergers and acquisitions= In 1981, Tetra Pack relocated its corporate headquarters to Lausanne, Switzerland, for tax reasons, but retained all research in Lund. For the equivalent of US$2.5 billion, Tetra Pak acquired Alfa-Laval AB in 1991, a Swedish company producing industrial and agricultural equipment and milk separators, world-leading in its industry, in what was at the time Sweden's largest takeover.Our Company History Alfalaval.com, retrieved 30 November 2011 Since the deal allowed Tetra Pak to integrate Alfa Laval processing know-how, the merger made it possible for Tetra Pak to offer packaging and processing solutions. The deal drew anti-competitive scrutiny from the European Commission, but it was approved after various concessions from both companies.Alfa Laval AB Claus Wohlert and Christina Stansell in International Directory of Company Histories, retrieved 30 November 2011 After the merger with Alfa Laval, Tetra Pak announced plans to return its headquarters to Sweden, and in 1993 Tetra Laval Group was created with dual headquarters in Lund and Lausanne. Alfa Laval's liquid processing unit was absorbed into Tetra Pak and the unit specialising in dairy production machinery was organised separately as Alfa Laval Agri. Alfa Laval Agri was later renamed DeLaval, after Alfa Laval's founder Gustaf de Laval, and is still a part of the Tetra Laval group.DeLaval in brief DeLaval.com, retrieved 30 November 2011 The part of Alfa Laval that was not directly linked to Tetra Pak's activities – heat exchangers and separation equipment among others – was sold in 2000 to Swedish finance group Industri Kapital.

Greatview, retrieved 14 May 2013 Products =Aseptic technology= Aseptic technology: Tetra Brik Aseptic, 1960s Tetra Pak uses aseptic packaging technology. In aseptic processing the product and the package are sterilized separately and then combined and sealed in a sterile atmosphere, in contrast to canning, where product and package are first combined and then sterilized. When filled with ultra-heat treated (UHT) foodstuffs (liquids like milk and juice or processed food like vegetables and preserved fruits), the aseptic packages can be preserved without being chilled for up to one year, with the result that distribution and storage costs, as well as environmental impact, is greatly reduced and product shelf life expanded.Tetra Pak vs Plastic Water Bottles?

CPD seeks to address this felt-need from the perspectives of marginalised stakeholders, by way of organising multistakeholder consultations, by conducting research on issues of critical national, regional and global interests, through dissemination of knowledge and information on key developmental issues, and by influencing the concerned policy making processes. CPD strives to bridge the gap between empirical research and policy advocacy through a sustained effort in public policy analyses. Over the past eighteen years CPD has emerged as Bangladesh's premier civil society think-tank, and has established its credibility as one of the very few platforms in Bangladesh where civil society organisations, stakeholder groups and political parties, often with diverse views and perspectives, are agreeable to sit around a dialogue table, and conduct an informed discussion about key issues of developmental concern and interest. Over the years, CPD has evolved into a South Asia centre of excellence and has attained credibility as a distinguished focal point for issues relating to the least developed countries (LDCs). The Centre was recognised as one of the top 228 leading think-tanks by the first global Go to Think Tank Survey in 2007, and was selected for support under the Think Tank Initiative through a globally competitive process.  Focus  CPD is an independent think-tank with local roots and global outreach. CPD focuses on frontier issues which are critical to the development process of Bangladesh, South Asia and LDCs in the present context, and those that are expected to shape and influence country's development prospects from the medium-term perspective. CPD's current programme portfolio includes research activities, holding of dialogues, publication and dissemination, and networking-related initiatives. CPD strives to enhance national capacity for economy-wide policy analyses, foster regional co-operation, and addresses issues which relate to Bangladesh's effective integration into the process of regionalisation and globalisation. CPD activities also focus on challenges for regional co-operation and integration in South Asia. Moreover, CPD engages its capacity to analyse and highlight factors affecting socioeconomic progress in the LDCs. CPD has been organising Indo-Bangladesh dialogues on a regular basis where high level policymakers and representatives of key stakeholder groups of the two countries discuss issues of bilateral interest. CPD is also actively involved in the Kunming Initiative which strives to foster co-operation among Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar. Among other things, CPD regularly organises international fora of the civil society organisations to advance the interests of the LDCs in the UN, WTO and other multilateral institutions.  Target Groups  CPD's target groups are diverse and include both global and local policymakers. CPD seeks to provide voice to the interests and concerns of the low-income economies in global development discourse. In doing so, CPD involves all important cross- sections of the society including public representatives, government officials, business leaders, representatives of grassroots organisations, academics, development partners and other relevant interest groups. These different groups are engaged in exchange of views in all the three phases of the CPD process: identification of socially relevant issues, generation of inputs for policy analysis, and validation of policy recommendations.  Operational Modality  CPD's civic activism in policy-related areas is operationalised through various means which are implemented by way of concrete initiatives. These include: * Knowledge generation through research and analysis, creation and management of data and information base. * Policy appreciation through dialogues, networking, information dissemination and mobilising support of the civil society for concrete policy agendas. * Policy influencing at national, regional and international levels, by involving policymakers in the dialogue process, and by contributing to preparation of global policy documents and national policy briefs. * Capacity building by way of organising policy appreciation workshops for policymakers and other important stakeholder groups.  Dialogue  At the core of CPD's activities lies its dialogue programme. CPD designs the dialogue format in such a way as to stimulate constructive engagement and informed exchange of views. Since the CPD dialogues are not intended to be merely academic, but tailored towards implementation, the discussions are designed to come up with specific recommendations reflecting stakeholders' views in terms of redefining the policies and ensuring their effective realisation on the ground. These recommendations are then placed before current and prospective policymakers of the country as inputs to the policy making process. One of the major CPD initiatives of recent times was the Bangladesh Vision 2021, a document prepared under the initiative of the Nagorik Committee (Citizen's Committee), based on a wide-ranging consultation held in Dhaka and several district headquarters of the country. Beyond issues of national importance, CPD dialogues also focus on those that concern regional and global interests of the country and other LDCs.  Research  CPD maintains an extensive research portfolio focusing on frontier issues that would define Bangladesh's socioeconomic transformation in the immediate future. The research issues pursued by the Centre also address the interests and concerns of South Asian as well as LDCs. The evolving research programme of CPD reflects the expressed demands of the policymakers, and attempts to provide voice to the absentee stakeholders in the policy making process. CPD deploys multistakeholder dialogues, along with traditional research techniques, to elicit analytical insights and to seek validation of the research conclusions. As a centre of excellence, CPD endeavours to interface its research outcomes with the ongoing global debates on contemporary development discourse. CPD partners with research institutions and agencies of global acclaim. For more than a decade now, CPD, as a partner institute of the World Economic Forum (WEF), is contributing to the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR). CPD is currently spearheading an independent partnership of international institutions to follow up the outcome of the Fourth UN LDC Conference. CPD's flagship output, titled the Independent Review of Bangladesh's Development (IRBD) regularly monitors the policy environment, macroeconomic indicators and sectoral variables of the country. Challenging the Injustice of Poverty: Agendas for Inclusive Development in South Asia is one of the important studies carried out by the CPD in recent times. Some of the other issues addressed in the immediate past at CPD included agricultural productivity and diversification, implications of WTO negotiations, regional connectivity and trade facilitation, implications of trade liberalisation on employment, promotion of foreign direct investment, impact of climate change on livelihood concerns, assessment of social safety net programmes, economic costs of spousal violence, export diversification, and efficacy of development institutions. Ongoing recent research activities of CPD have clustered under the following eight broad themes: # Macroeconomic Performance Analysis # Poverty, Inequality and Social Justice # Agriculture and Rural Development # Trade, Regional Cooperation and Global Integration # Investment Promotion, Infrastructure and Enterprise Development # Climate Change and Environment # Human Development and Social Protection # Development Governance, Policies and Institutions  Contribution to Policy Making  CPD researchers have been actively involved in contributing to the policy making process in the country as members of various committees and working groups set up by a range of public bodies including the Bangladesh Bank, Planning Commission, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Industries, and Ministry of Agriculture. CPD senior research staff are members of Panel of Economists for the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Boards of state-owned banks, WTO Advisory and Working Groups, and various other policy forums. Senior researchers of CPD, on a regular basis, disseminate CPD's research findings to the wider public through comments and interviews in newspapers, television and radio channels, and international media. They also regularly participate in television talk shows. Writing of op eds and popular pieces by the CPD researchers for leading newspapers on a regular basis is another way to reach the policy voice.  Support to Young Professionals  With a view to promote development vision and policy awareness amongst the young people of the country, CPD is implementing a Youth Leadership Programme. The aim of the programme is to inculcate leadership qualities and promote civic responsibility amongst the young professionals of the country through internship, research involvement, dialogue participation and civic activism. CPD regularly hosts international interns.  Capacity Building  CPD has been putting a considerable effort to support research-related capacity building in the country. The objective is to enable researchers, academics and representatives of various stakeholder groups to better appreciate and understand key issues related to Bangladesh's development, and give them exposure to analytical approaches and tools for in-depth examination of those issues. As part of such initiatives, CPD organises, on a regular basis, Advanced Lecture Series for fresh Economics graduates from universities where senior CPD staff deliver lectures on such topics as macroeconomic policy management, regional co-operation and impact of globalisation. Over the past eleven years CPD has been regularly organising Policy Appreciation Workshops on WTO and Bangladesh for mid-level government officials, researchers, academics, NGO representatives and journalists. CPD has also conducted courses on WTO and Implications for Bangladesh for young journalists and junior faculty of the Department of Economics of various universities.  Publication and Dissemination  CPD pursues a comprehensive programme for disseminating its research and dialogue outputs through regular publications and web- postings. CPD's current publication list contains more than 370 titles including Books, Monographs, Working Papers (Occasional Papers), Dialogue Reports and Policy Briefs. CPD Books and Monographs have been published by The University Press Ltd. (UPL), Pathak Shamabesh and on CPD's own initiative. CPD outputs are available for sale at the Centre and also in selected bookstores in Bangladesh. The Working Papers (Occasional Papers) and Dialogue Reports are posted on CPD's website. Information about ongoing CPD activities is also regularly published in the CPD Quarterly.  Reference and Documentation Unit  CPD has established a Reference and Documentation Unit (RDU) which serves as a repository of books, monographs, journals, periodicals and newspaper clippings on current and strategic policy issues. RDU puts special emphasis on policy documents and unpublished policy-related materials. Information generated through CPD's dialogue programmes and research activities is also systematically catalogued by the RDU.  Website and Media  CPD has created a website to expand its outreach and expedite the dissemination of dialogue and research outputs. The website has enabled CPD to substantially enhance its networking capacity. The address of the website is http://www.cpd.org.bd CPD has also launched its own blog for enhancing interaction with its stakeholders from different quarters. The blog was launched in March 2010. The blog allows posting of comments and sharing of views on CPD's latest activities, published reports and all other postings. It can be visited from the CPD Website Homepage. CPD's public dialogues are usually extensively reported by the print media and covered by the electronic media in Bangladesh.  Networking with Partner Institutions  CPD looks upon its capacity to fruitfully network with various organisations and institutions within the civil society as one of its core strengths. As of now, CPD has initiated and hosted a number of dialogues and research programmes in collaboration with organisations such as Oxfam International, ICTSD (Geneva), ODI (London), The Commonwealth Foundation, OECD, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UNDESA, UNDP, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), World Trade Organization (WTO), ILO, FAO, IRRI, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the World Bank. CPD is a partner institute of the World Economic Forum, popularly known as the Davos Forum, since 2001; DeFiNe Network of OECD Development Centre, Paris; and the ARTNeT-UNESCAP. CPD also maintains membership with the South Asia Network of Economic Research Institutes (SANEI) and a number of other Networks, and is one of the four Founders of the South Asia Economic Summit, an initiative of the premier civil society think-tanks in South Asia.

Written at the beginning of the partnership, it is notable in several recordings. It was originally released as a single in December 1963 by H-D-H lyricist Eddie Holland and peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 27 on the Billboard R&B; chart. The original recording has subsequently been released on compilation albums such as Heaven Must Have Sent You: Holland/Dozier/Holland Story, released in 2005, and The Complete Motown Singles Vol.3 (1963), released in 2006. As of 2016, the only CD to find the track in stereo is \\"A Collection of 16 Big Hits, Vol. 2\\" on Motown MOTD-5449. Motörhead version English hard rock band Motörhead released their version of \\"Leaving Here\\" as their debut single in 1977. Despite it being their first single, only the band's founder Lemmy remained from the band's original line-up. On April 28, 1979, Lemmy was interviewed by John Tobler on BBC Radio 1's Rock on Saturday show, and \\"Motorhead\\", \\"Leaving Here\\" and \\"Limb from Limb\\" were played. The recording was inspired by The Birds' 1965 cover version of Eddie Holland's \\"Leaving Here\\". Lemmy was a great fan of the band. =Releases= Motorhead had originally recorded a version of this song for their debut album On Parole, but unsure of its commercial viability their record company United Artists, to whom they were still under contract, were refusing to issue it. Jake Riviera of Stiff Records, a casual acquaintance of Lemmy's, offered to release a new single from the band. No official deals were made, the band paid for the studio time whilst Riviera paid all other expenses. The single was scheduled for release with catalogue number BUY9 when United Artists intervened forcing Stiff to shelve its distribution. The single was issued in France (on Skydog Records, MH001, black on white sleeve) and Sweden (on Blitz Records, MH001, purple on white sleeve) with some copies being imported into the UK. The tracks were included on two 1977 Stiff compilation albums, A Bunch of Stiff Records (SEEZ2,1/April/1977) contained \\"White Line Fever\\", and Hits Greatest Stiffs (FIST1,16/September/1977) contained \\"Leavin' Here\\". The single did eventually see a release as part of a box set of Stiff's first ten singles, limited to 5000 in 1979. Both tracks are currently available on the Stone Deaf Forever! CD box set. A live version of \\"Leaving Here\\" was issued in 1980 as the lead track on The Golden Years EP, reaching #8 on the UK Singles Chart. \\"White Line Fever\\" was re-recorded for their 1977 debut album release Motörhead. =Track listing= # \\"Leaving Here\\" (Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Eddie Holland) – 3:20 # \\"White Line Fever\\" [Stiff] (Eddie Clarke, Ian Kilmister, Phil Taylor) – 3:00 Other cover versions The Who recorded the song in the studio twice in 1965, and once for BBC Radio, but none of these recordings were released officially for decades; the 1985 compilation Who's Missing and the 1998 remaster of the Odds & Sods compilation album both included the song, though the latter states it is a previously unreleased version. An alternate take also appeared on the My Generation Deluxe Edition. The song is featured on \\"The Who BBC Sessions\\" CD. Additionally, it is available as downloadable content for the music video game series Rock Band as part of The Best of The Who pack. In 1965, The Birds recorded a cover version of \\"Leaving Here\\" which inspired heavy metal band Motörhead to produce their debut single with a cover of the song twelve years later. Swedish rock band Tages released a version as the B-Side to their single \\"In My Dreams\\" in 1966, which reached number one in the Swedish charts. Both tracks appear on their second studio album Tages 2.The song appeared as \\"Leavin' Here\\" on singles released by the Rationals in 1966 and 1967, as did a 1989 version by Tinsley Ellis on his debut album, Fanning the Flames. Pearl Jam recorded the song for the 1996 Home Alive compilation album which was released to fund women's self-defense classes. The song was later included on the band's 2003 Lost Dogs double album of B-sides and rarities. Pearl Jam has also covered the song numerous times at their live shows, and has released live recordings of the song as part of their bootleg series. In 2001, Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards recorded the song for their debut album, Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards, one of two cover songs used on the album, the other songs all being original. The version is very similar to the Motörhead cover version. Ron Wood included a cover of the song on his 2001 album Not for Beginners. This song often features in live sets by the Sadies, and Meeting of Important People frequently play it at live shows. English psych/garage band the Bugs recorded a cover of this song on their debut EP single on the Hit Records label in 1987, produced by Dave Goodman. The Irish rock band the Strypes recorded a cover of the song for their EP Young Gifted & Blue.

Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968) is considered a progenitor of the fictional zombie of modern culture A zombie (Haitian French: , ) is a fictional undead corporeal revenant created through the reanimation of a corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from Haitian folklore, in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as carriers, radiation, mental diseases, vectors, pathogens, parasites, scientific accidents, etc. The English word \\"zombie\\" was first recorded in 1819, in a history of Brazil by the poet Robert Southey, in the form of \\"zombi\\".\\"Zombie\\", in Oxford English Dictionary Online , accessed 23 May 2014. The quotation cited is: \\"Zombi, the title whereby he [chief of Brazilian natives] was called, is the name for the Deity, in the Angolan tongue.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary gives the word's origin as West African and compares it to the Kongo words (god) and or (fetish). Some authors also compare it to the Kongo word (ghost, revenant, corpse that still retains the soul), (body without a soul).Peter Laws, The Frighteners: Why We Love Monsters, Ghosts, Death & Gore, Icon Books, 2018William Graham Lister Randles, L’ancien royaume du Congo des origines à la fin du XIXe siècle, Éditions de l’École des hautes études en sciences sociales, 2013Doris L Garraway, The Libertine Colony: Creolization in the Early French Caribbean, Duke University Press, 2005 A Kimbundu-to-Portuguese dictionary from 1903 defines the related word nzumbi as soul, while a later Kimbundu–Portuguese dictionary defines it as being a \\"spirit that is supposed to wander the earth to torment the living\\". One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was The Magic Island (1929) by W. B. Seabrook. This is the sensationalized account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls. Time commented that the book \\"introduced 'zombi' into U.S. speech\\". Zombies have a complex literary heritage, with antecedents ranging from Richard Matheson and H. P. Lovecraft to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein drawing on European folklore of the undead. Victor Halperin directed White Zombie (1932), a horror film starring Bela Lugosi. Here zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician. Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s, with films including I Walked with a Zombie (1943) and Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). A new version of the zombie, distinct from that described in Haitian folklore, emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the 20th century. This interpretation of the zombie is drawn largely from George A. Romero's film Night of the Living Dead (1968), which was partly inspired by Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend (1954).Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro, ed. (2011). Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human. Fordham Univ Press. p. 169. , 9780823234479. The word zombie is not used in Night of the Living Dead, but was applied later by fans. The monsters in the film and its sequels, such as Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Day of the Dead (1985), as well as many zombie films it inspired, such as The Return of the Living Dead (1985) and Zombi 2 (1979), are usually hungry for human flesh, although Return of the Living Dead introduced the popular concept of zombies eating brains. The \\"zombie apocalypse\\" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has since become a staple of modern popular art. After zombie films such as Dawn of the Dead and Michael Jackson's music video Thriller (1983), the genre waned for some years. In the Far East during the late 1990s, the Japanese zombie video games Resident Evil and The House of the Dead led to a resurgence of zombies in popular culture. Additionally, The House of the Dead introduced a new type of zombie distinct from Romero's slow zombies: the fast-running zombie. These games were followed by a wave of low- budget Asian zombie films such as the zombie comedy Bio Zombie (1998) and action film Versus (2000), and then a new wave of Western zombie films in the early 2000s, including films featuring fast-running zombies such as 28 Days Later (2002), the Resident Evil and House of the Dead films, and the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake, while the British film Shaun of the Dead (2004) was in the zombie comedy subgenre. The late 2000s and 2010s saw the humanization and romanticization of the zombie archetype, with the zombies increasingly portrayed as friends and love interests for humans. Notable examples of the latter include movies Warm Bodies and Zombies, novels American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Generation Dead by Daniel Waters, and Bone Song by John Meaney, animated movie Corpse Bride, TV series Pushing Daisies and iZombie, and manga/novel/anime series Sankarea: Undying Love and Is This a Zombie? In this context, zombies are often seen as stand-ins for discriminated groups struggling for equality, and the human–zombie romantic relationship is interpreted as a metaphor for sexual liberation and taboo breaking (given that zombies are subject to wild desires and free from social conventions). Etymology The English word \\"zombie\\" is first recorded in 1819, in a history of Brazil by the poet Robert Southey, in the form of \\"zombi\\", actually referring to the Afro-Brazilian rebel leader named Zumbi and the etymology of his name in \\"nzambi\\". The Oxford English Dictionary gives the origin of the word as Central African and compares it to the Kongo words \\"nzambi\\" (god) and \\"zumbi\\" (fetish). In Haitian folklore, a zombie (Haitian French: , ) is an animated corpse raised by magical means, such as witchcraft. The concept has been popularly associated with the religion of voodoo, but it plays no part in that faith's formal practices. How the creatures in contemporary zombie films came to be called \\"zombies\\" is not fully clear. The film Night of the Living Dead made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as \\"zombies\\", describing them instead as \\"ghouls\\" (though ghouls, which derive from Arabic folklore, are demons, not undead). Although George Romero used the term \\"ghoul\\" in his original scripts, in later interviews he used the term \\"zombie\\". The word \\"zombie\\" is used exclusively by Romero in his script for his sequel Dawn of the Dead (1978),George A. Romero, Dawn of the Dead (Working draft 1977), horrorlair.com. including once in dialog. According to George Romero, film critics were influential in associating the term \\"zombie\\" to his creatures, and especially the French magazine . He eventually accepted this linkage, even though he remained convinced at the time that \\"zombies\\" corresponded to the undead slaves of Haitian voodoo as depicted in White Zombie with Bela Lugosi.. Folk beliefs =Haitian tradition= A depiction of a zombie, at twilight, in a field of sugar cane Zombies are featured widely in Haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of necromancy of a bokor, a sorcerer or witch. The bokor is opposed by the houngan (priest) and the mambo (priestess) of the formal voodoo religion. A zombie remains under the control of the bokor as a personal slave, having no will of its own. The Haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie, the \\"zombie astral\\", which is a part of the human soul. A bokor can capture a zombie astral to enhance his spiritual power. A zombie astral can also be sealed inside a specially decorated bottle by a bokor and sold to a client to bring luck, healing, or business success. It is believed that God eventually will reclaim the zombie's soul, so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity. The two types of zombie reflect soul dualism, a belief of Haitian voodoo. Each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul (the flesh or the spirit). The zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans and their subsequent experiences in the New World. It was thought that the voodoo deity Baron Samedi would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa (\\"Guinea\\"), unless they had offended him in some way, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie. A zombie could also be saved by feeding them salt. English professor Amy Wilentz has written that the modern concept of Zombies was strongly influenced by Haitian slavery. Slave drivers on the plantations, who were usually slaves themselves and sometimes voodoo priests, used the fear of zombification to discourage slaves from committing suicide. While most scholars have associated the Haitian zombie with African cultures, a connection has also been suggested to the island's indigenous Taíno people, partly based on an early account of native shamanist practices written by the Hieronymite monk Ramón Pané, a companion of Christopher Columbus. The Haitian zombie phenomenon first attracted widespread international attention during the United States occupation of Haiti (1915–1934), when a number of case histories of purported \\"zombies\\" began to emerge. The first popular book covering the topic was William Seabrook's The Magic Island (1929). Seabrooke cited Article 246 of the Haitian criminal code, which was passed in 1864, asserting that it was an official recognition of zombies. This passage was later used in promotional materials for the 1932 film White Zombie. In 1937, while researching folklore in Haiti, Zora Neale Hurston encountered the case of a woman who appeared in a village. A family claimed that she was Felicia Felix-Mentor, a relative, who had died and been buried in 1907 at the age of 29. The woman was examined by a doctor; X-rays indicated that she did not have a leg fracture that Felix- Mentor was known to have had. Hurston pursued rumors that affected persons were given a powerful psychoactive drug, but she was unable to locate individuals willing to offer much information. She wrote: \\"What is more, if science ever gets to the bottom of Vodou in Haiti and Africa, it will be found that some important medical secrets, still unknown to medical science, give it its power, rather than gestures of ceremony.\\" =African and related legends= A Central or West African origin for the Haitian zombie has been postulated based on two etymologies in the Kongo language, nzambi (\\"god\\") and zumbi (\\"fetish\\"). This root helps form the names of several deities, including the Kongo creator deity Nzambi a Mpungu and the Louisiana serpent deity Li Grand Zombi (a local version of the Haitian Damballa), but it is in fact a generic word for a divine spirit. The common African conception of beings under these names is more similar to the incorporeal \\"zombie astral\\", as in the Kongo Nkisi spirits. A related, but also often incorporeal, undead being is the jumbee of the English-speaking Caribbean, considered to be of the same etymology; in the French West Indies also, local \\"zombies\\" are recognized, but these are of a more general spirit nature. The idea of physical zombie-like creatures is present in some South African cultures, where they are called xidachane in Sotho/Tsonga and maduxwane in Venda. In some communities, it is believed that a dead person can be zombified by a small child. It is said that the spell can be broken by a powerful enough sangoma. It is also believed in some areas of South Africa that witches can zombify a person by killing and possessing the victim's body in order to force it into slave labor. After rail lines were built to transport migrant workers, stories emerged about \\"witch trains\\". These trains appeared ordinary, but were staffed by zombified workers controlled by a witch. The trains would abduct a person boarding at night, and the person would then either be zombified or beaten and thrown from the train a distance away from the original location. =Origins of zombie beliefs= Chemical hypothesis Several decades after Hurston's work, Wade Davis, a Harvard ethnobotanist, presented a pharmacological case for zombies in a 1983 article in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, and later in two popular books: The Serpent and the Rainbow (1985) and Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie (1988). Davis traveled to Haiti in 1982 and, as a result of his investigations, claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being introduced into the blood stream (usually through a wound). The first, (\\"powder strike\\"), includes tetrodotoxin (TTX), a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the pufferfish (family Tetraodontidae). The second powder consists of deliriant drugs such as datura. Together these powders were said to induce a deathlike state, in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor. Davis also popularized the story of Clairvius Narcisse, who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice. The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders is part of a recently buried child's brain.Davis, Wade (1985), The Serpent and the Rainbow, New York: Simon & Schuster, pp. 92–95.Davis, Wade (1988), Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie, University of North Carolina Press, pp. 115–116. The process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike suspended animation, followed by re-awakening — typically after being buried — into a psychotic state. The psychosis induced by the drug and psychological trauma was hypothesised by Davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie, since they \\"knew\\" that they were dead and had no other role to play in the Haitian society. Societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by Davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state, and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards, exhibiting attitudes of low affect. Davis's claim has been criticized, particularly the suggestion that Haitian witch doctors can keep \\"zombies\\" in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years. Symptoms of TTX poisoning range from numbness and nausea to paralysis — particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm — unconsciousness, and death, but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance. According to psychologist Terence Hines, the scientific community dismisses tetrodotoxin as the cause of this state, and Davis' assessment of the nature of the reports of Haitian zombies is viewed as overly credulous.Hines, Terence, \\"Zombies and Tetrodotoxin\\", Skeptical Inquirer, May/June 2008, volume 32, issue 3, pages 60–62. Social hypothesis Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing highlighted the link between social and cultural expectations and compulsion, in the context of schizophrenia and other mental illness, suggesting that schizogenesis may account for some of the psychological aspects of zombification. Particularly, this suggests cases where schizophrenia manifests a state of catatonia. Roland Littlewood, professor of anthropology and psychiatry, published a study supporting a social explanation of the zombie phenomenon in the medical journal The Lancet in 1997. The social explanation sees observed cases of people identified as zombies as a culture-bound syndrome, with a particular cultural form of adoption practiced in Haiti that unites the homeless and mentally ill with grieving families who see them as their \\"returned\\" lost loved ones, as Littlewood summarizes his findings in an article in Times Higher Education: Evolution of the modern zombie archetype Pulliam and Fonseca (2014) and Walz (2006) trace the zombie lineage back to ancient Mesopotamia. In the Descent of Ishtar, the goddess Ishtar threatens: She repeats this same threat in a slightly modified form in the Epic of Gilgamesh. T. P. Cooke as Frankenstein's Monster in an 1823 stage production of the novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, while not a zombie novel per se, prefigures many 20th-century ideas about zombies in that the resurrection of the dead is portrayed as a scientific process rather than a mystical one, and that the resurrected dead are degraded and more violent than their living selves. Frankenstein, published in 1818, has its roots in European folklore,Warner, Marina. A forgotten gem: Das Gespensterbuch ('The Book of Ghosts'), An Introduction. whose tales of vengeful dead also informed the evolution of the modern conception of the vampire. Later notable 19th-century stories about the avenging undead included Ambrose Bierce's \\"The Death of Halpin Frayser\\" and various Gothic Romanticism tales by Edgar Allan Poe. Though their works could not be properly considered zombie fiction, the supernatural tales of Bierce and Poe would prove influential on later writers such as H. P. Lovecraft, by Lovecraft's own admission.H. P. Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature (1927, 1933–1935). In the 1920s and early 1930s, the American horror author H. P. Lovecraft wrote several novellae that explored the undead theme. \\"Cool Air\\", \\"In the Vault\\", and \\"The Outsider\\" all deal with the undead, but Lovecraft's Herbert West–Reanimator (1921) \\"helped define zombies in popular culture\\". This series of short stories featured Herbert West, a mad scientist who attempts to revive human corpses with mixed results. Notably, the resurrected dead are uncontrollable, mostly mute, primitive and extremely violent; though they are not referred to as zombies, their portrayal was prescient, anticipating the modern conception of zombies by several decades. Edgar Rice Burroughs similarly depicted animated corpses in the second book of his Venus series, again without ever using the terms \\"zombie\\" or \\"undead\\". Avenging zombies would feature prominently in the early 1950s EC Comics, which George A. Romero would later claim as an influence. The comics, including Tales from the Crypt, Vault of Horror and Weird Science, featured avenging undead in the Gothic tradition quite regularly, including adaptations of Lovecraft's stories, which included \\"In the Vault\\", \\"Cool Air\\" and Herbert West–Reanimator. Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend, although classified as a vampire story, would nonetheless have a definitive impact on the zombie genre by way of George A. Romero. The novel and its 1964 film adaptation, The Last Man on Earth, which concern a lone human survivor waging war against a world of vampires, would by Romero's own admission greatly influence his 1968 low-budget film Night of the Living Dead,Biodrowski, Steve. \\"Night of the Living Dead: The classic film that launched the modern zombie genre\\". a work that would prove to be more influential on the concept of zombies than any literary or cinematic work before it. A popular evolution of the zombie is the \\"fast zombie\\" or running zombie. In contrast to Romero's classic slow zombies, \\"fast zombies\\" can run, are more aggressive, and often more intelligent. This type of zombie has origins in 1990s Japanese horror video games. In 1996, Capcom's survival horror video game Resident Evil featured zombie dogs that run towards the player. Later the same year, Sega's arcade shooter The House of the Dead introduced running human zombies, who run towards the player. The running human zombies introduced in The House of the Dead video games became the basis for the \\"fast zombies\\" that became popular in zombie films during the early 21st century, starting with 28 Days Later (2002), the Resident Evil and House of the Dead films, and the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake. Tor Johnson as a zombie with his victim in the cult movie Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) Modern fiction =In film and television= Films featuring zombies have been a part of cinema since the 1930s, with White Zombie (directed by Victor Halperin in 1932) being one of the earliest examples. With George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), the zombie trope began to be increasingly linked to consumerism and consumer culture. Today, zombie films are released with such regularity (at least 55 films were released in 2014 alone) that they constitute a separate subgenre of horror film. Voodoo-related zombie themes have also appeared in espionage or adventure-themed works outside the horror genre. For example, the original \\"Jonny Quest\\" series (1964) and the James Bond novel Live and Let Die as well as its film adaptation both feature Caribbean villains who falsely claim the voodoo power of zombification in order to keep others in fear of them. George Romero's modern zombie archetype in Night of the Living Dead was influenced by several earlier zombie-themed films, including White Zombie, Revolt of the Zombies (1936) and The Plague of the Zombies (1966). Romero was also inspired by Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend (1954), along with its film adaptation, The Last Man on Earth (1964). George A. Romero and the modern zombie film (1968–1985) A young zombie (Kyra Schon) feeding on human flesh, from Night of the Living Dead (1968) The modern conception of the zombie owes itself almost entirely to George A. Romero's 1968 film Night of the Living Dead.Stephen Harper, Night of the Living Dead: Reappraising an Undead Classic. Bright Lights Film Journal, Issue 50, November 2005. In his films, Romero \\"bred the zombie with the vampire, and what he got was the hybrid vigour of a ghoulish plague monster\\". This entailed an apocalyptic vision of monsters that have come to be known as Romero zombies. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film. \\"I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them\\", complained Ebert, \\"They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else.\\" According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:Roger Ebert, review of Night of the Living Dead, Chicago Sun-Times, 5 January 1969; last accessed 8 July 2014. > The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. > The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and > had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle > from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and > crying. Romero's reinvention of zombies is notable in terms of its thematics; he used zombies not just for their own sake, but as a vehicle \\"to criticize real-world social ills—such as government ineptitude, bioengineering, slavery, greed and exploitation—while indulging our post-apocalyptic fantasies\\". Night was the first of six films in Romero's Living Dead series. Its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, was released in 1978. Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 was released just months after Dawn of the Dead as an ersatz sequel (Dawn of the Dead was released in several other countries as Zombi or Zombie). Dawn of the Dead was the most commercially successful zombie film for decades, up until the zombie revival of the 2000s. The 1981 film Hell of the Living Dead referenced a mutagenic gas as a source of zombie contagion: an idea also used in Dan O'Bannon's 1985 film Return of the Living Dead. Return of the Living Dead featured zombies that hungered specifically for brains. Relative decline in the Western world (1985–1995) Zombie films in the 1980s and 1990s were not as commercially successful as Dawn of the Dead in the late 1970s. The mid-1980s produced few zombie films of note. Perhaps the most notable entry, the Evil Dead series, while highly influential, are not technically zombie films, but films about demonic possession, despite the presence of the undead. 1985's Re-Animator, loosely based on the Lovecraft story, stood out in the genre, achieving nearly unanimous critical acclaim and becoming a modest success, nearly outstripping Romero's Day of the Dead for box office returns. After the mid-1980s, the subgenre was mostly relegated to the underground. Notable entries include director Peter Jackson's ultra-gory film Braindead (1992) (released as Dead Alive in the U.S.), Bob Balaban's comic 1993 film My Boyfriend's Back, where a self-aware high-school boy returns to profess his love for a girl and his love for human flesh, and Michele Soavi's Dellamorte Dellamore (1994) (released as Cemetery Man in the U.S.). Early Asian zombie films (1985–1995) In 1980s Hong Kong cinema, the Chinese jiangshi, a zombie-like creature dating back to Qing dynasty era jiangshi fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, were featured in a wave of jiangshi films, popularised by Mr. Vampire (1985). Hong Kong jiangshi films were popular in the Far East from the mid-1980s to early 1990s. Prior to the 1990s, there were not many Japanese films related to what may be considered in the West as a zombie film. Early films such as The Discarnates (1988) feature little gore and no cannibalism, but it is about the dead returning to life looking for love rather than a story of apocalyptic destruction. One of the earliest Japanese zombie films with considerable gore and violence was Battle Girl: The Living Dead in Tokyo Bay (1991). Zombie revival in the Far East (1996–2001) According to Kim Newman in the book Nightmare Movies (2011), the \\"zombie revival began in the Far East\\" during the late 1990s, largely inspired by two Japanese zombie games released in 1996: Capcom's Resident Evil, which started the Resident Evil video game series that went on to sell 24 million copies worldwide by 2006, and Sega's arcade shooter House of the Dead. The success of these two 1996 zombie games inspired a wave of Asian zombie films. From the late 1990s, zombies experienced a renaissance in low-budget Asian cinema, with a sudden spate of dissimilar entries, including Bio Zombie (1998), Wild Zero (1999), Junk (1999), Versus (2000) and Stacy (2001). Most Japanese zombie films emerged in the wake of Resident Evil, such as Versus, Wild Zero, and Junk, all from 2000. The zombie films released after Resident Evil behaved similarly to the zombie films of the 1970s, except that they were influenced by zombie video games, which inspired them to dwell more on the action compared to older Romero films. Worldwide zombie film revival (2001–2008) The zombie revival, which began in the Far East, eventually went global, following the worldwide success of the Japanese zombie games Resident Evil and The House of the Dead. Resident Evil in particular sparked a revival of the zombie genre in popular culture, leading to a renewed global interest in zombie films during the early 2000s. In addition to being adapted into the Resident Evil and House of the Dead films from 2002 onwards, the original video games themselves also inspired zombie films such as 28 Days Later (2002) and Shaun of the Dead (2004). This led to the revival of zombie films in global popular culture. The turn of the millennium coincided with a decade of box-office successes in which the zombie subgenre experienced a resurgence: the Resident Evil movies (2002–2016), the British films 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later (2007), the Dawn of the Dead remake (2004), and the comedies Shaun of the Dead and Dance of the Dead (2008). The new interest allowed Romero to create the fourth entry in his zombie series: Land of the Dead, released in the summer of 2005. Romero returned to the series with the films Diary of the Dead (2008) and Survival of the Dead (2010). Generally, the zombies in these shows are the slow, lumbering and unintelligent kind, first made popular in Night of the Living Dead. The Resident Evil films, 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake all set box-office records for the zombie genre, reaching levels of commercial success not seen since the original Dawn of the Dead in 1978. Motion pictures created in the 2000s, like 28 Days Later, the House of the Dead and Resident Evil films, and the Dawn of the Dead remake, have featured zombies that are more agile, vicious, intelligent, and stronger than the traditional zombie. These new type of zombie, the fast-running zombie, has origins in video games, with Resident Evils running zombie dogs and especially The House of the Dead game's running human zombies. Continued film success and zombie TV series (2008–2015) The success of Shaun of the Dead led to more successful zombie comedies during the late 2000s to early 2010s, such as Zombieland (2009) and Cockneys vs Zombies (2012). By 2011, the Resident Evil film adaptations had also become the highest-grossing film series based on video games, after they grossed more than worldwide. In 2013, the AMC series The Walking Dead had the highest audience ratings in the United States for any show on broadcast or cable with an average of 5.6 million viewers in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The film World War Z became the highest-grossing zombie film, and one of the highest-grossing films of 2013. At the same time, starting from the mid-2000s, a new type of zombie film has been growing in popularity: the one in which zombies are portrayed as humanlike in appearance and behavior, retaining the personality traits they had in life, and becoming friends or even romantic partners for humans rather than a threat for humanity. Notable examples of human–zombie romance include the stop-motion animated movie Corpse Bride, live-action movies Warm Bodies, Camille, Life After Beth, Burying the Ex, and Nina Forever, and TV series Pushing Daisies and Babylon Fields. According to zombie scholar Scott Rogers, \\"what we are seeing in Pushing Daisies, Warm Bodies, and iZombie is in many ways the same transformation [of the zombies] that we have witnessed with vampires since the 1931 Dracula represented Dracula as essentially human—a significant departure from the monstrous representation in the 1922 film Nosferatu\\". Rogers also notes the accompanying visual transformation of the living dead: while the \\"traditional\\" zombies are marked by noticeable disfigurement and decomposition, the \\"romantic\\" zombies show little or no such traits. Relative decline (2015–present) In the late 2010s, zombie films began declining in popularity, with elevated horror films gradually taking their place, such as The Witch (2015), Get Out (2016), A Quiet Place (2018) and Hereditary (2018). An exception is the low-budget Japanese zombie comedy One Cut of the Dead (2017), which became a sleeper hit in Japan, and it made box office history by earning over a thousand times its budget. One Cut of the Dead also received worldwide acclaim, with Rotten Tomatoes stating that it \\"reanimates the moribund zombie genre with a refreshing blend of formal daring and clever satire\\". The \\"romantic zombie\\" angle still remains popular, however: the late 2010s saw the release of the TV series American Gods and iZombie, as well as the 2018 Disney Channel Original Movie Zombies (its sequel, Zombies 2, is scheduled for release in 2020). Zombie apocalypse Intimately tied to the concept of the modern zombie is the \\"zombie apocalypse\\": the breakdown of society as a result of an initial zombie outbreak that spreads. This archetype has emerged as a prolific subgenre of apocalyptic fiction and has been portrayed in many zombie-related media after Night of the Living Dead. In a zombie apocalypse, a widespread (usually global) rise of zombies hostile to human life engages in a general assault on civilization. Victims of zombies may become zombies themselves. This causes the outbreak to become an exponentially growing crisis: the spreading phenomenon swamps normal military and law-enforcement organizations, leading to the panicked collapse of civilized society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain, scavenging for food and supplies in a world reduced to a pre-industrial hostile wilderness. Possible causes for zombie behavior in a modern population can be attributed to viruses, bacteria or other phenomena that reduce the mental capacity of humans, causing them to behave in a very primitive and destructive fashion. Subtext The usual subtext of the zombie apocalypse is that civilization is inherently vulnerable to the unexpected, and that most individuals, if desperate enough, cannot be relied on to comply with the author's ethos. The narrative of a zombie apocalypse carries strong connections to the turbulent social landscape of the United States in the 1960s, when Night of the Living Dead provided an indirect commentary on the dangers of conformity, a theme also explored in the novel The Body Snatchers (1954) and associated film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). Many also feel that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxieties about the end of the world. One scholar concluded that \\"more than any other monster, zombies are fully and literally apocalyptic ... they signal the end of the world as we have known it\\". While zombie apocalypse scenarios are secular, they follow a religious pattern based on Christian ideas of an end-times war and messiah. Simon Pegg, who starred in and co-wrote the 2004 zombie comedy film Shaun of the Dead, wrote that zombies were the \\"most potent metaphorical monster\\". According to Pegg, whereas vampires represent sex, zombies represent death: \\"Slow and steady in their approach, weak, clumsy, often absurd, the zombie relentlessly closes in, unstoppable, intractable.\\" He expressed his dislike for depictions of fast zombies and argued that zombies should be slow-moving and inept; just as a healthy diet and exercise can delay death, zombies are easy to avoid, but not forever. He also argued that this was essential to making them \\"oddly sympathetic ... to create tragic anti- heroes ... to be pitied, empathised with, even rooted for. The moment they appear angry or petulant, the second they emit furious velociraptor screeches (as opposed to the correct mournful moans of longing), they cease to possess any ambiguity. They are simply mean.\\" Story elements John A. Russo portrays a zombie in Night of the Living Dead # Initial contacts with zombies are extremely dangerous and traumatic, causing shock, panic, disbelief and possibly denial, hampering survivors' ability to deal with hostile encounters. # The response of authorities to the threat is slower than its rate of growth, giving the zombie plague time to expand beyond containment. This results in the collapse of the given society. Zombies take full control, while small groups of the living must fight for their survival. The stories usually follow a single group of survivors, caught up in the sudden rush of the crisis. The narrative generally progresses from the onset of the zombie plague, then initial attempts to seek the aid of authorities, the failure of those authorities, through to the sudden catastrophic collapse of all large-scale organization and the characters' subsequent attempts to survive on their own. Such stories are often squarely focused on the way their characters react to such an extreme catastrophe, and how their personalities are changed by the stress, often acting on more primal motivations (fear, self-preservation) than they would display in normal life. =In print and literature= One of the various zombie panel discussion at the 2012 New York Comic Con, featuring writers who have worked in the genre (left to right): Jonathan Maberry, Daniel Kraus, Stefan Petrucha, Will Hill, Rachel Caine, Chase Novak, and Christopher Krovatin. Also present but not visible in the photo was Barry Lyga. In the 1990s, zombie fiction emerged as a distinct literary subgenre, with the publication of Book of the Dead (1990) and its follow-up Still Dead: Book of the Dead 2 (1992), both edited by horror authors John Skipp and Craig Spector. Featuring Romero-inspired stories from the likes of Stephen King, the Book of the Dead compilations are regarded as influential in the horror genre and perhaps the first true \\"zombie literature\\". Horror novelist Stephen King has written about zombies, including his short story \\"Home Delivery\\" (1990) and his novel Cell (2006), concerning a struggling young artist on a trek from Boston to Maine in hopes of saving his family from a possible worldwide outbreak of zombie-like maniacs.The New York Times, 12 February 2006. Max Brooks's novel World War Z (2006) became a New York Times bestseller.The New York Times, 15 November 2006. Brooks had previously authored The Zombie Survival Guide (2003), a zombie-themed parody of pop-fiction survival guides.Craig Wilson, \\"Zombies lurch into popular culture via books, plays, more\\", USA Today, 9 April 2009, p. 1D (1st page of Life section, above the fold), found at Zombies lurch into popular culture article at USA Today. Retrieved 13 April 2009. Brooks has said that zombies are so popular because \\"Other monsters may threaten individual humans, but the living dead threaten the entire human race.... Zombies are slate wipers.\\" Seth Grahame-Smith's mashup novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2009) combines the full text of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813) with a story about a zombie epidemic within the novel's British Regency period setting. In 2009, Katy Hershbereger of St. Martin's Press stated: \\"In the world of traditional horror, nothing is more popular right now than zombies... The living dead are here to stay.\\" 2000s and 2010s were marked by a decidedly new type of zombie novel, in which zombies retain their humanity and become friends or even romantic partners for humans; critics largely attribute this trend to the influence of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series. One of the most prominent examples is Generation Dead by Daniel Waters, featuring undead teenagers struggling for equality with the living and a human protagonist falling in love with their leader. Other novels of this period involving human–zombie romantic relationships include Bone Song by John Meaney, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Midnight Tides by Steven Erikson, and Amy Plum's Die for Me series; much earlier examples, dating back to the 1980s, are Dragon on a Pedestal by Piers Anthony and Conan the Defiant by Steve Perry. =In anime and manga= There has been a growth in the number of zombie manga in the last decade, and in a list of \\"10 Great Zombie Manga\\", Anime News Network's Jason Thompson placed I Am a Hero at number 1, considering it \\"probably the greatest zombie manga ever\\". In second place was Living Corpse, and in third was Biomega, which he called \\"the greatest science-fiction virus zombie manga ever\\". During the late 2000s and early 2010s, there were several manga and anime series that humanized zombies by presenting them as protagonists or love interests, such as Sankarea: Undying Love and Is This a Zombie? (both debuted in 2009). Z ~Zed~ was adapted into a live action film in 2014. =In art= Artist Jillian McDonald has made several works of video art involving zombies and exhibited them in her 2006 show \\"Horror Make-Up\\", which debuted on 8 September 2006 at Art Moving Projects, a gallery in, Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Artist Karim Charredib has dedicated his work to the zombie figure. In 2007, he made a video installation at Villa Savoye called \\"Them !!!\\", wherein zombies walked in the villa like tourists. =In video gaming= The release of two 1996 horror games Capcom's Resident Evil and Sega's The House of the Dead sparked an international craze for zombie games. In 2013, George A. Romero said that it was the video games Resident Evil and House of the Dead \\"more than anything else\\" that popularised zombies in early 21st century popular culture. The modern fast-running zombies have origins in these games, with Resident Evils running zombie dogs and especially House of the Deads running human zombies, which later became a staple of modern zombie films. Zombies went on to become a popular theme for video games, particularly in the survival horror, stealth, first-person shooter and role-playing game genres. Important horror fiction media franchises in this area include Resident Evil, The House of the Dead, Silent Hill, Dead Rising, Dead Island, Left 4 Dead, Dying Light, State of Decay, The Last of Us and the Zombies game modes from the Call of Duty title series. A series of games has also been released based on the widely popular TV show The Walking Dead, first aired in 2010. World of Warcraft, first released in 2004, is an early example of a video game in which an individual zombie-like creature could be chosen as a player character (a previous game in the same series, Warcraft III, allowed a player control over an undead army). PopCap Games' Plants vs. Zombies, a humorous tower defense game, was an indie hit in 2009, featuring in several best-of lists at the end of that year. The massively multiplayer online role-playing game Urban Dead, a free grid-based browser game where zombies and survivors fight for control of a ruined city, is one of the most popular games of its type. DayZ, a zombie-based survival horror mod for ARMA 2, was responsible for over 300,000 unit sales of its parent game within two months of its release. Over a year later, the developers of the mod created a standalone version of the same game, which was in early access on Steam, and so far has sold 3 million copies since its release in December 2013. Romero would later opine that he believes that much of the 21st century obsessions with Zombies can be traced more towards video games than films, noting that it was not until the 2009 film Zombieland that a Zombie film was able to gross more the 100 million dollars. Outside of video games, zombies frequently appear in trading card games, such as Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game (which even has a Zombie-Type for its \\"monsters\\"), as well as in role-playing games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, tabletop games such as Zombies!!! and Dead of Winter: A Cross Roads Game, and tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer Fantasy and 40K. The game Humans vs. Zombies is a zombie-themed live-action game played on college campuses. Writing for Scientific American, Kyle Hill praised the 2013 game The Last of Us for the game's plausibility, which based its zombie enemies on a fictional strain of the Cordyceps fungus, which has real-world parasitic properties. Despite plausibility, to date there have been no documented cases of humans infected by Cordyceps. Zombie video games have remained popular in the late 2010s, as seen with the commercial success of the Resident Evil 2 remake and Days Gone in 2019. This enduring popularity may be attributed, in part, to the fact that zombie enemies are not expected to exhibit significant levels of intelligence, making them relatively straightforward to program. However, less pragmatic advantages, such as those related to storytelling and representation, are increasingly important. = In government media = On 18 May 2011, the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a graphic novel Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse providing tips to survive a zombie invasion as a \\"fun new way of teaching the importance of emergency preparedness\\". The CDC goes on to summarize cultural references to a zombie apocalypse. It uses these to underscore the value of laying in water, food, medical supplies, and other necessities in preparation for any and all potential disasters, be they hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, or hordes of zombies. On 17 October 2011, The Weather Channel in the United States published an article \\"How To Weather the Zombie Apocalypse\\", which included a fictional interview with a Director of Research at the CDD, the \\"Center for Disease Development\\". Questions answered include \\"How does the temperature affect zombies' abilities? Do they run faster in warmer temperatures? Do they freeze if it gets too cold?\\" In 2011, the US government drafted CONPLAN 8888, a training exercise detailing a strategy to defend against a zombie attack. =In music= Michael Jackson's music video Thriller (1983), in which he dances with a troop of zombies, has been preserved as a cultural treasure by the Library of Congress' National Film Registry. Many pop-culture media have paid tribute to this video, such as a gathering of 14,000 university students dressed as zombies in Mexico City, and 1500 prisoners in orange jumpsuits recreating the zombie dance in a viral video. The Brooklyn hip hop trio Flatbush Zombies incorporate many tropes from zombie fiction and play on the theme of a zombie apocalypse in their music. They portray themselves as \\"living dead\\", describing their use of psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin mushrooms as having caused them to experience ego death and rebirth. =In social activism= A Zombie Walk in Pittsburgh The zombie also appears as a metaphor in protest songs, symbolizing mindless adherence to authority, particularly in law enforcement and the armed forces. Well-known examples include Fela Kuti's 1976 album Zombie and The Cranberries' 1994 single \\"Zombie\\". Organized zombie walks have been staged, either as performance art or as part of protests that parody political extremism or apathy. A variation of the zombie walk is the zombie run. Here participants do a 5 km run wearing a belt with several flag \\"lives\\". If the chasing zombies capture all of the flags, the runner becomes \\"infected\\". If he or she reaches the finish line, which may involve wide detours, ahead of the zombies, then the participant is a \\"survivor\\". In either case an appropriate participation medal is awarded. =In theoretical academic studies= Researchers have used theoretical zombie infections to test epidemiology modeling. One study found that all humans end up turned or dead. This is because the main epidemiological risk of zombies, besides the difficulties of neutralizing them, is that their population just keeps increasing; generations of humans merely \\"surviving\\" still have a tendency to feed zombie populations, resulting in gross outnumbering. The researchers explain that their methods of modelling may be applicable to the spread of political views or diseases with dormant infection. Adam Chodorow of the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University investigated the estate and income tax implications of a zombie apocalypse under United States federal and state tax codes. Neuroscientists Bradley Voytek and Timothy Verstynen have built a side career in extrapolating how ideas in neuroscience would theoretically apply to zombie brains. Their work has been featured in Forbes, New York Magazine, and other publications.

He was born in Radeln, Transylvania (nowadays Roadeş, part of Buneşti commune, Romania) in 1729 and joined the Austrian army at age 17. He served in the Seven Years' War as aide de camp for Leopold Josef Graf Daun. He was promoted to colonel in 1781. He fought on the lower Rhine in 1794 and the middle Rhine in 1795. He later led the Austrian army in Italy during Napoleon Bonaparte's campaigns in Italy, part of the War of the Second Coalition. Serving under Russian field marshal Alexander Suvorov, who commanded Second Coalition forces, he commanded Austrian forces in victories at the battles of Cassano, Trebbia, Novi, Genola and the Siege of Genoa, and came near to another victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Marengo before making the mistake of handing over command to a subordinate for what he thought was the pursuit from the field of a beaten foe. A stand made by the French forces further down the road, and a subsequent counter-attack by the French General Louis Desaix led to a defeat for von Melas' forces.

Doe's father moved to Greenville in 1903 and opened a grocery store in the building that now serves as the restaurant. The family lived in a house behind the store. The grocery, which the Signa family called \\"Papa's Store,\\" performed relatively well financially until the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. After the flood, Big Doe Signa started a bootlegging business to help provide for his family. After several years he finally sold his 40-barrel still for $300 and a Ford Model T. At first, Signa ran a honky-tonk, strictly for blacks, in the front part of the store. Buffalo fish and chili were regular menu items at that time. Because of the racial segregation at the time it was socially unacceptable for whites to come into Doe's. Therefore, when a local white doctor began to stop at Doe's for a meal between house calls, Doe would serve him steaks in the rear of the store. As word-of-mouth spread about the steaks, Doe decided to start a restaurant in the rear of the building. For a short time, the honky tonk and restaurant co-existed. As the restaurant continued to grow in popularity, the honky-tonk was eventually closed. The restaurant has been racially integrated since the beginning. \\"Big Doe\\" retired in 1974 and passed along the business to his two sons Doe Jr. and Charles. Doe, Sr. died on April 27, 1987, and Mamie died on November 5, 1955. The original Doe's Eat Place is still run from the building in which it started. It is a relatively small and shabby building in the middle of a downscale neighborhood. The dining area contrasts with the outside of the building by being clean and nicely maintained. Doe's has been described as having a \\"dive-y atmosphere\\" and \\"ramshackle surroundings.\\" Customers enter the restaurant through the kitchen, and are traditionally greeted by a member of the Signa family (usually male).

Raczek (March 4, 1938 – July 23, 2013) was an American high school football coach. One of the most successful coaches in the history high school football in the state of Wisconsin, he was the head football coach Pacelli High School in Stevens Point, Wisconsin from 1966 to 2013, leading them to three state championships in 1986, 1995, and 2005. Raczek won numerous awards in coaching and was the third-most successful coach in Wisconsin High School football history. Early life Raczek was born and raised in the farming community of Knowlton, Wisconsin. Raczek grew up surrounded by labor and hard work, which would then dissolve from hard farm work, into hard football practices. Raczek loved football, and he played high school football at Mosinee, where he also excelled in other sports such as volleyball, track, and wrestling. Raczek then attended the University of Wisconsin–Stout, where he played football, and was also an assistant coach. He graduated from Wisconsin–Stout in 1962, and went on to pursue a teaching career. However, football was not far behind. Raczek soon married, and is still currently married to his wife, Pat. Together, they had three sons and a daughter: Mary Ellen, Steve, Mark, and Matt Both Steve and Mark played under their father at Pacelli, and both were recognized in the conference and the state as great football players and wrestlers. Raczek found a job at Tri County-Plainfield high school, where he was teaching technical education, physical education, and was head of the maintenance department. Raczek first took up the head coaching spot for Tri-County in 1962, where he finished with a 0–7 record. He coached for three more years, when he was offered a job at Stevens Point Pacelli High School (Wisconsin) in Stevens Point. Raczek accepted. Playing career =High school= Raczek attended the Mosinee high school, where there he played football and other sports. Raczek loved the game, and grew to understand what makes football so great. Raczek currently lives around Mosinee, so he is still in touch with his roots. Raczek recalled, \\"I made lifelong friendships from coaching this great game of football and to have worked with so many great coaches and players.\\" Raczek then moved onto the University of Wisconsin–Stout, where he learned about different sciences, and football.https://web.archive.org/web/20071019141105/http://www.wifca.org/halloffame/2000/2000raczekbob.html =UW–Stout= Raczek left Mosinee High School, and headed for northern Wisconsin to the University of Wisconsin–Stout. There, Raczek pursued a Bachelor of Science degree, and wanted to teach. As a student of UW–Stout, Raczek participated in numerous sports, such as wrestling, volleyball, track, and of course football. He learned what the college life of football was really about, and how much more different it is from the high school level. As a student, Raczek received an assistant coaching job for the football team. So, in the 1961-62 football season, Raczek was assistant coach of the UW–Stout football team. He learned terminology and plays that he would later transform into the plays he had for the Pacelli Cardinals. Raczek graduated from the university in 1962, then later he was offered a job to teach and coach at the Plainfield-Tri County High School. Raczek accepted, and his head coaching duties began. Head coaching career =Tri County Penguins= Fall is a time for football, and Raczek knew it. He had played football and helped coach since his early days as a child, and not he had the chance to be the head coach of a real football team. In the fall of 1962, Raczek came to Plainfield- Tri County as the head football coach, and the tech-ed teacher. He taught in both football, and tech-ed for four years at the high school before pursuing new locations to teach and coach. Racek had started his coaching career with University of Wisconsin–Stout as an assistant coach in 1961. He had played for them as well, and attended the school, so he knew the system. Raczek was a huge fan of the running game, and would later pass that onto his players in the high school level. Raczek coached for UW–Stout for only one year, leaving to go to Plainfield. As the head football coach for Plainfield-Tri County, his records did not live up to what he is known for today. In the four years that he coached for them, he had two winning seasons. His first finished a record of 0–7. His second season finished 3–4. In two years, Raczek was 3-11. He did not give up though, and neither did the school. His third season he finished a good 6–2. His fourth and final season with Plainfield-Tri County he finished 5–3. Raczek understood the high school level of football, and then went on to Pacelli High School to teach his new ideas, that would lead him to three state titles and 310 career wins. =Pacelli Cardinals (football)= Bob Raczek assumed head coaching for the football team of Pacelli High School in 1967, where his hard-working attitude would shape the school into a very notable high school. Pacelli High School is a private school, with not a lot of funding into the athletic department, so Raczek made do with what he had at the time. The Cardinals finished the 1967 season with a record of 4–5, finishing in sixth place in the conference. Not only was Raczek the head football coach, he later assumed the coaching spots for wrestling, track, and hockey, as well as teach technical education and physical education. The next year, the Cardinals finished the same as the previous, a 4–5 record placing sixth in the conference. For the next two years, the team suffered losing records of 1-7-1 1969 and 2-7 1970. But in 1971 the Cardinals' football team had a winning record for the first time since 1965. They finished the season with a 9–1 record, placing first in the conference. The following season would be Pacelli's best season in their history of having a football team. The team reached the state championship apart of WISAA. The championship game ended with the Cardinals losing to Milwaukee Pius XI by the final score of 10–0. Raczek gave the Cardinals non-losing records 12 of the next 13 seasons. In 1986, the Cardinals made it back to the WISAA state championship game, this time they would face off against Waukesha Catholic Memorial. The championship game was played at Pacelli's homefield, Goerke Field (the same location where the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point football team plays). Pacelli defeated Waukesha Catholic Memorial by a final score of 13–3, capping a perfect season at 13–0. The Cardinals would again see the championship lights in 1989 at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison but would fall short, losing to Watertown Northwestern Prep, 44-20 and again in 1992, falling to Marshfield Columbus 28–10. In 1995, the Cardinals set numerous school records that year in rushing, sacks, and tackles. The Cardinals made it to the WISAA Division 3 championship game where they defeated Manitowoc Lutheran, 28–0. The season ended with a perfect 12–0 record, (the last Pacelli football team to go undefeated) and only allowed 77 points all season (the 1986 Cardinals beat them by allowing only 55 points). The 1995 Cardinals also scored 458 points. The following year, the Cardinals made it back to the state championship game but lost the game to conference rival Marshfield Columbus, 42–6. The 1998 team would fall to Manitowoc Roncalli 27–7 in the state title game and then to Eau Claire Regis 19–6 in the 1999 championship game, the final season of WISAA. In 2000, the Cardinals moved into the WIAA. The 2005 Cardinals managed to find a way into the state championship, being a part of Division 7. Going into the playoffs, the Cardinals were not a top seed, but defeated all of their opponents leading to the title game (except Hilbert, who lost to Pacelli by a score of 7-0). The Cardinals played the Gilman Pirates, and it would be Bob Raczek's 300th career win. The Cardinals defeated Gilman 44–20, giving Raczek his third state title. With the 300 wins, Raczek joined Wisconsin football coaches Bob Hyland and Dick Basham as the only coaches in state history to reach more than 300 wins. In 2006, the Cardinals went 9-0 during the regular season and entered the playoffs as a No. 1 seed, and then won their first round contest. However, they lost in the second round to conference foe Shiocton Chiefs, who Pacelli had beaten earlier that season. Bob Razcek's record currently stands at 332-150-2. =Championships= Raczek received state titles in WISAA in 1986 and 1995. He won one recently in 2005 apart of the WIAA in Division 7, also marking his 300th career win. Bob Raczek went to the state title game nine times, winning three (3-6). His conference championship record is much better, winning the old Central Wisconsin Catholic Conference title 10 times (1971 1972 1974 1976 1978 1981 1986 1987 1994 1995), and winning the new CWC-L (Central Wisconsin Conference-Large) two times, 2001 and 2006. Bob Raczek is known for greatness, and in teaching his players the values of life, on and off the football field. Cancer The shocking news came to the Raczek family in 2004 that Bob Raczek has been diagnosed with cancer. Doctors did not know whether it would be life-threatening, and offered Raczek chemotherapy. Raczek had a hard time telling his players during a practice that season, and the players did not take it too well. Many people of the school and community feared that 2004 would be Raczek's last season coaching football. The legendary coach had imprinted his image in the hearts of thousands of people throughout Wisconsin, and it would be painful to see a great coach of that magnitude to retire under those circumstances, as did the great Vince Lombardi. Raczek however overcame the pains, and still managed to coach the following season. Raczek coached his final season in 2012 before succumbing to colon cancer on July 28, 2013. Legacy =Notable rivalries= Bob Raczek is virtually synonymous with Pacelli football, and the high school at that matter. Over the past 40 years, there have been some really close games that have excited the fans, and even the media. Pacelli High School football has had its share of rivalries. Marshfield Columbus The classic rivalry in Pacelli football history has always been against Marshfield Columbus Catholic High School in the old Central Wisconsin Catholic Conference. The game often determined the champion of the conference. Marshfield Columbus holds a 29-17-1 advantage in the series, ranging from 1957 to 1999. Pacelli has always struggled against Marshfield Columbus (even in Pacelli's dominant 1986 season, Pacelli only won with a score of 3-0 over Marshfield Columbus). =Eau Claire Regis= Like the classic rivalry between Marshfield Columbus, Eau Claire Regis has had great games against Pacelli. The rivalry was as good, ranging from 1961 to 1999. In those years, Pacelli has had the upper hand, with a record of 25–18. However, in recent years the rivalry has changed, seeing Regis defeat Pacelli in some critical games. Although the two teams are no longer in the same conference, they met in 2002 and 2003, both games being in the WIAA playoffs. In 2002, the Cardinals went 8–1 in the regular season, and fared well in the playoffs. However, in the semifinals Regis edged Pacelli in a close 21-14 contest, ending a great season for the Cardinals. The following year, the two teams met again, this time it was all Regis, defeating the Cardinals 24–0. The rivalry between the two schools had died down for a little bit since moving to separate conferences, but the playoff games have helped renew the rivalry once again. La Crosse Aquinas The Cardinals also had their share of tough battles with La Crosse Aquinas, another former member of the CWCC. Pacelli has played Aquinas 45 times, starting in 1961, where in their first meeting Aquinas dominated the game winning 39–6. Aquinas holds a 25-20 edge in the series with Pacelli, though the Cardinals have dominated the series in recent years as the teams have continued to play non-conference games against one another. Bob Raczek always seems to select Aquinas as the season opener, to get a feeling of pride and confidence in not only beating, but playing Aquinas. The rivalry died down a little in the early 2000s, once Pacelli and Aquinas separated from the CWCC conference. For the start of the 2007 regular season, Pacelli will play against Aquinas in Stevens Point. =Honors= * In 1999, Raczek was inducted into the Stevens Point Pacelli Athletic Hall of Fame. * In 2000, Raczek was inducted into the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame. * Raczek was named District Coach of the Year in 2006 * Raczek was named All Conference coach 8 times. * Raczek has won three state titles, and been to nine total.

Various locations have been named for the site, but the tomb in Susa, Iran (Persia), is the most widely accepted, it being first mentioned by Benjamin of Tudela, who visited Asia between 1160 and 1163. Susa‌, Iran The Book of Daniel mentions that Daniel lived in Babylon and may have visited the palace of Susa‌, Iran,Book of Daniel 8:2 but the place where he died is not specified; the tradition preserved among the Jews and Arabs is that he was buried in Susa. Today the Tomb of Daniel in Susa is a popular attraction among local Muslims and Iran's Jewish community alike. 19th-century engraving of Daniel's tomb in Susa, from Voyage en Perse Moderne, by Flandin and Coste The earliest mention of Daniel's Tomb published in Europe is given by Benjamin of Tudela who visited Asia between 1160 and 1163. In the façade of one of its many synagogues he was shown the tomb assigned by tradition to Daniel. Benjamin declares however, that the tomb does not hold Daniel's remains, which were said to have been discovered at Susa about 640 A.D. The remains were supposed to bring good fortune: and bitter quarrels arose because of them between the inhabitants of the two banks of the Choaspes River. All those living on the side on which Daniel's grave was situated were rich and happy, while those on the opposite side were poor and in want; the latter, therefore, wished the bier of Daniel transferred to their side of the river. They finally agreed that the bier should rest alternately one year on each side. This agreement was carried out for many years, until the Persian shah Sanjar, on visiting the city, stopped the practise, holding that the continual removal of the bier was disrespectful to the prophet. He ordered the bier to be fastened with chains to the bridge, directly in the middle of the structure; and he erected a chapel on the spot for both Jews and non-Jews. The king also forbade fishing in the river within a mile of Daniel's bier.Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela [Hebr.], ed. Asher, i. 74–76, ii. 152–154; cf. Petachiah of Regensburg, p. 77, below, Jerusalem, 1872. According to Benjamin, the place is a dangerous one for navigation, since godless persons perish immediately on passing it; and the water under the bier is distinguished by the presence of goldfish. Interior of the tomb Muslim traditions agree in stating that Daniel was buried at Susa, and a similar tradition was current among the Syriac writers.Budge, Book of the Bee, p. 73. Al-Baladhuri (ninth century) says that when the conqueror Abu Musa al-Ash'ari came to Susa in 638, he found the coffin of Daniel, which had been brought thither from Babylon in order to bring down rain during a period of drought.compare Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, i. 2567. Abu Musa referred the matter to the calif Umar, who ordered the coffin to be buried, which was done by sinking it to the bottom of one of the streams nearby.Futuḥ al-Buldan, p. 378. A similar account is given by 10th-century Arab chronicler Ibn Hawqal who writes: : > \\"In the city of Susa there is a river and I have heard that in the time of > Abu Musa al Ashari a coffin was found there; it is said to contain the bones > of Daniel the Prophet. The people held it in great veneration and in times > of distress, famine or droughts brought it out and prayed for rain. Abu > Mousa Al Ashoari ordered that the coffin be encased with three coverings and > submerged it in the river so that it could not be viewed. The grave can be > seen by anyone who dives to the bottom of the water\\".ed. Michael Jan de > Goeje, p. 174. Istakhri gives a similar account and adds that the Jews were accustomed to make a circuit around Daniel's tomb and to draw water in its neighborhood.ed. De Goeje, p. 92; see also Yaqut, Mu'jam al-Buldan, iii. 189. Al-Muqaddasi refers to the contention between the people of Susa and those of Tustar.ed. De Goeje, p. 417 A slightly divergent tradition reported by Ibn Taimiyyah says that the body was found in Tustar; that at night thirteen graves were dug, and it was put in one of these—a sign according him, that the early Muslims were opposed to the worship of the tombs of holy men.Z. D. M. G. iii. 58). William Ouseley in Walpole's Memoirs of the East described the Tomb of Daniel in Susa as being situated in \\"a most beautiful spot, washed by a clear running stream and shaded by planes and other trees of ample foliage. The building is of Mahomedan date and is inhabited by a solitary Dervish, who shows the spot where the prophet is buried beneath, a small and simple square brick mausoleum, said to be (without probability) coeval with his death. It has, however, neither date nor inscription to prove the truth or falsehood of the Dervish's assertion. The small river running at the foot of this building, which is called the Bellerau, it has been said flows immediately over the prophets Tomb, and from the transparency of the water, his coffin was to be seen at the bottom; but the Dervish and the natives whom I questioned remembered no tradition corroborating such a fact; on the contrary; it has at all times been customary with the people of the country to resort hither on certain days of the months, when they offer up their prayers at the tomb I have mentioned, in supplication to the prophet's shade.\\" The current tomb was renovated and repaired in 1870 A.D. by order of Shia scholar Sheikh Jafar Shooshtari, the work being executed by Haj Mulla Hassan Memar. Later Mulla Hassan's son, Mulla Javad carried out further renovations in the site.http://www.ensani.ir/storage/Files/20110129085505-91.pdf Alternative locations =Iran= *Malamir The Jewish Encyclopedia notes that a five days journey from Dezful, near Mala Amir, in Khuzestan of Iran, there is another sacred tomb said to be that of Daniel. =Iraq= Babylon The Martyrologium Romanum of 1584 assigned Saint Daniel's feastday to July 21. The place of his death is given as Babylon, Mesopotamia.Manlio Sodi and Roberto Fusco (edd.), Martyrologium Romanum editio princeps (1584), Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Città del Vaticano, 2005, p. 248. Though this martyrology does not say so, it was claimed that he was buried in the royal vault there. Kirkuk A tomb attributed to Daniel is located within the Kirkuk Citadel in the city of Kirkuk, Iraq. Originally the site was a Jewish synagogue then later it was turned into a Christian church and finally into a Muslim mosque. The mosque has arches, pillars and two domes on a decorated base and beside it there are three minarets, which belong to the end of the Mongolian reign. The mosque is about 400 square meters and houses four tombs believed to belong to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. As from the respect of Kirkuk people towards Prophet, they desired to bury their dead next to Daniel's Tomb. This graveyard may be regarded as the first cemetery in Kirkuk. http://www.greece.org/alexandria/tomb2/mosque.htmhttp://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=32&letter;=D Mosul A tomb attributed to the Prophet Daniel also was located in Mosul, Iraq, until it was demolished by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in July 2014. Muqdadiyah A reference to the Tomb of Daniel being located in the village of Al Wajihiya near Muqdadiyah, Iraq, was made after a bombing at the site in 2007. The tomb, situated in the Diyala Governorate, was targeted by Islamist terrorists and most of the structure collapsed as a result, including its green dome. =Turkey= *Mausoleum of Danyal in Tarsus, Mersin and also Tarsus Grand Mosque. =Uzbekistan= Samarkand There is another claimed tomb of Daniel, located just outside Samarkand, Uzbekistan. According to the local legend, the Turkic conqueror Amir Timur attempted to conquer Syria for many years, but was unsuccessful. One of his ministers suggested it was because the saint from the biblical times, Daniel, was buried there. Timur then sent his army to where Daniel was entombed in Syria, and after a fierce fight with the Syrians, was able to take some of his remains back to Uzbekistan. It is also said that on the day Daniel was entombed a natural source of water sprung up at that spot, and it is believed by locals that its water has the power to heal. = Morocco = The shrine of Sidi Denaine, or Daniel, is located at Jorf El-Yhoudi in Morocco.

Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475 (1867), was the first suit to be brought against a President of the United States in the United States Supreme Court. The state of Mississippi attempted to sue President Andrew Johnson for enforcing Reconstruction. The court decided, based on a previous decision of Marbury v. Madison that the President has two kinds of tasks: ministerial and discretionary. Discretionary tasks are ones the president can choose to do or not to do, while ministerial tasks are ones required by his office: those whose failure to perform could leave him in violation of the Constitution. The court ruled that by enforcing Reconstruction, Johnson was acting in an \\"executive and political\\" capacity--a discretionary rather than a ministerial one--and so he could not be sued.

Her parents took her to Kaleido Stage as a child. Although they died shortly thereafter, and Sora was adopted by her father's cousin and his wife, Sora is inspired by this childhood memory to become a member of the Stage when she reaches adulthood. With her adoptive parent's hesitant approval she travels to the United States to audition. After Sora's luggage is stolen, she stops the thief but is late to the audition. After being depressed due to her failed performance, the owner Kalos, having seen her chase earlier, convinces her to perform in the actual show. Most of the cast, including Layla Hamilton, are dissatisfied with Sora due to the special circumstances through which she joins; Her manager Ken has feelings for her and accepted her from the start and they kiss in the end of the series,the other cast members accept Sora due to her persistence and hard work along with her magnetic personality, as well as performing a stunt called \\"The Golden Phoenix\\". Though Sora is a fairly talented performer, there are often huge gaps in her ability, especially on the trapeze. This is because she was never taught before joining the Stage and so the first maneuver she learns is Layla's Golden Phoenix, an exceptionally difficult move, so she mostly knows only extremely challenging maneuvers and very little of the basics. : In the beginning of the series Sora is the only one who can see the magical stage spirit Fool. This character reveals she has been chosen by the stage. In the first season, Fool reveals only she can perform the Legendary Great Maneuver with Layla. In the second, he reveals that she has the potential to become a \\"true star\\". : In the second season, Leon does not approve of Sora, and May tries to prove that she is better than Sora, and should have been the one to perform the legendary maneuver with Layla. At first, Sora aimed for being Leon's partner, but then, while doing the Angel's act with Yuri, she realizes that what she really wanted was to turn Kaleido Stage into a joyful and happy stage just like the one she saw when she first saw Cinderella at the Stage, along with no conflict, and stick to that dream, which she told Layla, while still wanting to be a true star. =Layla Hamilton= ; : : Layla is an accomplished and seasoned, but arrogant, performer of Kaleido Stage. At first rivals with Sora, Layla becomes friends with her after they become partners for Freedom, a performance that is about people who overcome their differences to be free. : Layla has a strained relationship with her father, Kevin Hamilton, a wealthy hotel chain owner who attempts to force her daughter to become an actress and is frequently trying to push her into doing so. However, Layla decides to rejoin the circus due to her fondness for the Kaleido Stage, as her mother has gone there during her youth. : When Layla starts to see Fool, she becomes Sora's partner for the maneuver. While training in the Grand Canyon, both Layla and Sora start to gain each others trust and become good friends. However, Layla's arm is injured, and after performing the great Mystical Act she is unable to perform on Kaleido Stage. In the second season, she becomes a Broadway actress and her new partner is producer Cathy Taymor. She visits Sora many times and they still share that special bond. =Mia Guillem= ; : : Mia was born in Holland and is a close friend of Sora's. In the second episode, Mia accepts Sora's presence on the stage after Sora attempts to perform the Golden Phoenix. Later in the series, Mia becomes passionate about writing the scripts for Kaleido Star's performances; she has a keen interest in introducing literature into Kaleido Star's acts. She occasionally has inner conflicts between performing and tending to her sick grandmother, who is Mia's biggest fan. =Anna Heart= ; : : Anna is also good friend of Sora's. She, like Mia, comes to accept Sora after the second episode. Anna is talented in many areas and frequently plays more serious parts. Anna truly wishes to perform comedy and usually tries to get Mia to write comedy into her parts. The request is almost always denied. Anna takes her love of comedy from her estranged father Jack, a stand-up comedian; when they meet each other after several years, though, Anna is perturbed by his bitterness, but with a push from Sora and Mia they part amiably. In season two she gets paired up with two girls that find her extremely funny and help her with her comedy acts for the shows. Anna is determined to make Ken her partner but he always hates the idea of performing comedy. =Yuri Killian= ; : : Yuri, like Layla, is an experienced performer, yet he's deeply traumatized by a terrible tragedy. His father, Arlon Brass, died attempting the Mystical Act, and he never forgave Kalos for letting his father die. Yuri plays a pivotal role in the second half of the first season when he betrays the stage, first by stealing away a good portion of the cast and later by buying out the stage and taking control of it. He later agrees to return it to Kalos if Layla and Sora accomplish the same Mystical Act that caused his father's death; when they manage to do so, he fulfills his promise. In the second season, Yuri helps Sora get into the Circus Festival in Paris. He appears to be a bitter rival of Leon's, and feels that he is responsible for the death of Leon's sister, Sophie who was a lot like Sora in many ways. =Fool= ; : : Fool is the mysterious spirit of the stage. He is about the size of an action figure, and appears as a type of jester or clown. He appears to Sora shortly before she appears on the Kaleido Stage for the first time. Fool is invisible to everyone but those who are destined to do great things on the stage and/or whose heart is completely dedicated to the stage. He seems to be the spirit of a true jester who once was devoted to a princess who never smiled. : Although a ghost, Fool is a pervert who tries many times throughout the series to see Sora, and sometimes her friends, naked (usually by suggesting that they should take a shower). Sora is quick to prevent Fool from peeking in any given situation by trapping him somewhere or rebuking him forcefully, most often in a comedic, slapstick fashion. Later in the first season, Layla becomes capable of seeing Fool as well; the same happens to Rosetta at the end of the second season, who takes his advice more seriously than Sora, most of the time where Sora can tell he is only doing so to satisfy his perversion. : In his more useful moments, he acts as a fortune teller, revealing possible futures to Sora. In the first season, he reads the future by drawing a single tarot card. In the second season, he reveals the hidden workings of inter-character relationships, associating each character with a sign of the zodiac and stating how some signs are dimmer or brighter. He is also the one who explains the inner mechanics of the Legendary Great Maneuver to Layla and Sora in episode 25, An Amazing Bond. =Sarah Dupont= ; : : Sarah is the main singer of Kaleido Stage from the United Kingdom, as well as the building manager for the dorms where everyone lives. Many want Sarah to sign on a record label because she is so gifted in singing, but she stays true to Kaleido Stage. She is an avid fan of martial arts, and frequently proposes bizarre alternative methods to help Sora achieve her objectives, such as working out with Master Lin during the production of The Little Mermaid. : Sarah is well acquainted with Kalos and has been with the Stage from the beginning, when she and Kalos were performing on the streets with another friend. This friend, Andy, returns once to try to persuade Sarah to leave Kaleido Stage with offering her a singing career, but she refuses. =Ken Robbins= ; : : Ken is the stage manager for Kaleido. He used to want to perform onstage when he was young, but claims to have a weak heart and decided that it was best to be backstage. Ken also greatly admires Sora, in many respects, and has a huge crush on her, but never has the guts to confess his feelings for her, though everyone else is aware of his feelings for her, in one instance even trying to help him confess to her. In one episode, he does manage to confess to Sora, but Mr. Policeman misinterprets his confession and causes Sora to believe he means it as a fan. This does not stop Ken from doing everything he can to help Sora out; frequently he acts as her personal trainer, warning her of the dangers she might encounter, and he acts as the voice of reason for the group on several occasions. Anna is determined to make Ken her partner in comedy, which he is equally determined not to do. =Kalos Eido= ; : : Kalos is the head manager and boss of the entire Kaleido Stage and gives Sora many helpful pieces of advice throughout the anime. He also maintains high expectations of everyone he encounters. Before Kaleido Stage, Kalos was a stage magician and acrobat and used to perform on the street with Sarah and Andy; their past relationship is rather vague. Kalos founded Kaleido Stage with the money he got from the insurance company after he injured his fingers during an audition for a spot in Las Vegas. As a professional, he has strict standards when it comes to how things are run at the Kaleido Stage and how his performers should conduct themselves. While he's firm in his decisions, occasionally he'll give in and let people spread their wings as they please. Kalos is also the one who trained Yuri's father, Arlon Brass, for the Mystical Act, but sadly this failed and Arlon died, traumatising Yuri and embittering him. He is the only person who can tell Layla and Sora how to train for the act. =Mr. Policeman= ; : : Jerry is self-described throughout the show as Sora's \\"#1 fan\\". He's a tall, muscled African-American policeman who has helped and supported her from episode one. He is also secretly in love with Kate, a doctor who occasionally appears to help cast members through physical injuries. In the second season, Jerry gathers up his courage and proposes to Kate. =Marion Benigni= ; : : Marion is a young girl living near the stage. Her father is a designer and engineer and works on the sets, but her mother Cynthia (a former trampolinist) is dead due to an accident. Like many of the others, Marion does not accept Sora at first (and specially when Sora attempts to use trampolines in her acts), but is quickly won over to her side. In the second season Marion begins to perform with the group on the Children's Stage. =Jonathan= ; : : Jonathan is a baby seal that Sora picked up one day. Unable to keep pets, Sora tries to hide him. However, the secret is revealed and instead of kicking him out, Marion's father Jake builds a tank for him. He is capable of doing many tricks and sometimes seems more coordinated than Sora, creating comical performances that the attending children love. During the second season, Jonathan becomes closer to Marion and refuses to perform with anyone else. =Rosetta Passel= ; : : Rosetta is a Belgian-born, French-raised world champion diabolo performer. After her first performance at Kaleido Stage, Kalos kicks her off the stage because her act was unsatisfying: he explains that despite being perfect in the technical field, she lacked passion at what she was doing, so everyone was bored by her act. Feeling this wasn't fair, Sora takes the girl under her wing, teaching her how to put audience enjoyment before technical perfection. In return, Rosetta teaches Sora diabolo, which Sora returns to when she needs help learning new acts. Towards the end of the first season, Rosetta returns to join Sora after Kaleido Stage is taken over by Yuri. She joins Sora's troupe and witnesses Sora and Layla performing the Legendary Great Maneuver together. Rosetta returns in the second season wishing to become a trapeze artist, following in Sora's steps. In episode 51 she becomes able to see Fool. =May Wong= ; : : First appearing in the second season, May is a Chinese- American ex-figure skater and new recruit who challenges Sora's position. She became jealous of Sora because not only did she perform the legendary maneuver with Layla, but that Layla calls Sora \\"her dreams\\" and has faith that Sora will succeed her as a true performer and also Leon's unusual interest in her. Sora and May have a tense rivalry for most of the second season, which aids both in becoming better performers. May turns out to be exceptionally talented and becomes Leon's partner for the Dracula show. However, during one of the performances, Leon drops her off and causes her to dislocate her shoulder; this allows Sora to obtain the spot for the Circus festival they were practicing for. May, realizing that it takes more than hard work and self- confidence to be a good star, refuses to give up her spot just like that and overtakes Sora with a new one armed trick, finally besting Sora and putting her on top. As she does so, May lays off her arrogance and becomes a better person, even accepting Sora's friendship since she now understands why Layla chose her as a successor. =Leon Oswald= ; : : Leon is a very famous trapeze performer who arrives in the second season. He comes off as arrogant, refusing to perform with Sora, because she is not skilled enough for him. His true desire, however, lies in a promise he made to his dying sister Sophie: to see the Angel's Act, an unrivaled and beautiful trapeze act they had developed, completed. He is a rival of Yuri Killian, whom he blames for the death of Sophie in an accident. Sora in some ways is like Sophie which is why Leon became interested in her, close to the end of season 2 Leon finally accepts Sora as his partner. =Mr. Kenneth= ; : : Mr. Kenneth is an elderly man and representative for the Stage's stockholders. He is often portrayed as a producer, seemingly giving him executive powers often rivaling or superseding that of Kalos. He has great experience in show business and often aids Sora. He knows Ken's personality, but always calls him \\"boy\\". =Simon Park= ; : : Simon Park is highly sought as an Entertainment Industry Writer, Director and Producer. An associate of Layla's family, Simon is a likable, charming and brilliant-minded 'English Accented' Playful-Pervert who often has a wise crack to warm even the most tense of moods. : Hired during the first Season of Kaleido Star as Mia Guillem's Mentor and Script Supervisor, Simon is highly responsible for Mia Guillem's grand success for her first written script and stage play \\"Freedom\\". Although criticism and the script's countless revisions nearly break Mia at one point, Simon's confidence in Mia as his apprentice leads him to passionately answer calls in the middle of the night as Mia works hard day and night on \\"Freedom\\"—a stage play which could either make or break Kaleido Stage as Yūri Kirian begins his buyout. Much thanks to Simon's guidance, \\"Freedom\\" sells out for its first two weeks. Unfortunately, Yūri cancels all following shows after he begins his blind vengeance and buys out Kaleido Star. Simon also appears in the final episode of Season One to witness Sora and Layla's performance of \\"The Legendary Great Maneuver\\" and is first to stand and clap during that performance. =Cathy Taymor= ; : : Cathy Taymor is introduced in episode 34 during Season Two as the Writer and Director of \\"Salome In Vegas\\", an off-Broadway stage-play starring Layla Hamilton. She is also presented as Layla's \\"new career partner\\" who gave her the desire to perform once again after she exits Kaleido Stage due to her injury. Although she initially introduces herself kindly during Sora's second one week leisure from Kaleido Stage, her real character is that of a fast- talking-fast-paced-brash-and-outspoken 30-something fireball of energy. Cathy's relationship with Layla as her \\"new partner\\" emotionally distresses Sora at first. Later in the series, much like with Simon Park in Season One, Kalos once again outsources an experienced director to mentor Kaleido Stage's budding writer and director Mia Guillem: this experienced director is Cathy. : During production of \\"Romeo And Juliet\\", Mia falls in love with Cathy's direct and take-no-prisoner's-style and begins to look up to Cathy as her mentor. Later, during production of \\"Swan Lake\\", Cathy and Mia become close and trusting friends and together come up with amazing ideas for Kaleido Star's version of the play. Although her introduction is somewhat subtle, Cathy is an important character who inspires and motivates nearly every person in Kaleido Stage either directly or indirectly.

It runs west to east between New York State Route 108 in Cold Spring Harbor and New York State Route 25A in Kings Park. Most of the road is two lanes wide, although there are some areas where it opens up to four lanes, or simply allows center-left- turn lanes. Within northwestern Suffolk County, CR 11 provides the closest access to the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, since it runs roughly parallel to the tracks throughout its span. Route description CR 11 begins an intersection with NY 108 just east of the Nassau–Suffolk county line. In Nassau County, the road is Woodbury Road and designated ( but unsigned) as CR 12\\\\. CR 11 interrupts Woodbury Road, rather than replaces it. Shortly after this intersection, Woodbury Road moves north towards Huntington, while Pulaski Road, part of New York State Bicycle Route 25A (NYS Bike Route 25A), treks eastward. In Huntington Manor CR 11 intersects with CR 92 where NYS Bike Route 25A turns south. It then crosses the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road at an at-grade crossing before reaching the intersection of NY 110 in Huntington Station. Also in Huntington Station is the intersection of CR 35, which has become a connection between the North Shore and NY 231, since the cancellation of the proposed Babylon–Northport Expressway. East of this point, much of the road is dotted with town houses and condominiums built along frontage roads. In Greenlawn, the road intersects with unsigned CR 9 (Cuba Hill Road), and signed CR 86 (Broadway-Greenlawn Centerport Road). Greenlawn Park is a local baseball field that runs along all three streets, and no others. In East Northport the road winds left near Oswego Drive, where the formerly proposed Babylon-Northport Expressway was intended to have an interchange. From there, Pulaski Road intersects CR 10 (Elwood Road) and then after Larkfield Road. NY 108 at its southern terminus in Cold Spring Harbor facing westbound on CR 11 Crossing over the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road a second time, Pulaski Road takes a steep drop down a hill far below the level of the tracks, where it encounters the intersection of Bread and Cheese Hollow Road. After, Pulaski Road leaves the Town of Huntington and enters the Town of Smithtown. Sunken Meadow State Parkway was built underneath Pulaski Road in the 1950s. It shares a cloverleaf interchange, which has the southernmost ramps squeezed tightly between the train trestle carrying the LIRR Port Jefferson line. From there on, the name of the road is immediately changed to East Northport Road. NYS Bike Route 25A rejoins CR 11 at Old Commack Road, and CR 11 ends at NY 25A just two blocks west of Church Street. Northeast of CR 11's terminus at NY 25A, the road turns into Old Dock Road and runs along the west side of the former Kings Park State Hospital until reaching the Nissequogue River. History CR 11 was assigned on January 27, 1930.

Located in Salt Lake City, Utah it opened for business in August 1952.  Early life  Harman was born in 1919 in Granger, now a part of West Valley City, a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah to David Reese Harman (1874–1924) and Grace May Hemenway (1879–1919) . Harman was the youngest of 14 children in a Latter-day Saint family. Harman's mother died two days after he was born, and his father later married Caroline Hemenway Harman, the widow of Pete's uncle. Harman was a major donor to the construction of the Caroline Hemenway Harman Continuing Education Building at Brigham Young University, named after his step-mother.Deseret News, Nov. 19, 2014 Harman and his wife, Arline, opened their first restaurant, The Do Drop Inn, with two employees in 1941. They had met in the 1930s while both employees at the same restaurant in San Francisco, California, and married in 1938.  Career  Harman worked with Colonel Sanders to develop and prepare the KFC system for franchising, working to develop training manuals and product guides. His other claims to fame are the development of the bucket packaging and the emphasis on the \\"Finger-lickin' good\\" motto. In 1990 the International Foodservice Manufacturer Association recognized Harman's achievements with its Gold Plate Award. At the time of the award the Harman Management Corp. of Los Altos, California, employed over 4,000 people and operated 238 KFC stores in four states. Credit for his success was given to his enlightened practices towards his staff including stock purchase schemes. His original KFC building was demolished in 2004 to make way for a museum and an updated restaurant. Harman relocated to Los Altos, California as the scope of his business expanded in the 1960s. He lived there until his death on November 19, 2014, at 95 years old.

The football team and its youth side is part of a larger sports association of approximately 1,000 members that has departments for athletics, billiards, boxing, chess, disabled sports, gymnastics, hiking, swimming, table tennis, volleyball, and general recreation. History The club was originally formed as Neuruppiner Turnerbund in the fall of 1919. It evolved into the military sports club Militärsportverein Neuruppin before becoming Märkischer Sportverein Neuruppin. After World War II the club was re- established as SG Neuruppin in the fall of 1945 and then went through a quick succession of name changes playing variously as ZSG Neuruppin (1948), Nordwest Neuruppin (1949), BSG Konsum Neuruppin (1950), BSG Empor Mitte Neurppin (1951), and finally, BSG Empor Neuruppin (1952). The club played as Elektronik Neuruppin from 1983 to 1989 and after German re-unification was known briefly as TuS Neuruppin before re-claiming its current name in 1990. The club played as an anonymous side the East German fourth division Berzirksliga Potsdam through most of the 50s and 60s. In the mid-70s Neuruppin began a climb that took them to a first-place finish in Group 1 of the division in 1980, but despite being unable to advance from there, they continued to finish strongly until the mid-80s. They did not enjoy any other meaningful on-field success until the turn of the millennium. After the merger of the football leagues of the two Germany's in the early 90s Neuruppin would initially compete in what was then the Landesliga Brandenburg (V). League re-structuring in 1994 made the division a sixth tier circuit where the club delivered uneven results until capturing the division championship in 2000 and advancing to the Verbandsliga Brandenburg (V). Neuruppin immediately took a second title and was promoted to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (IV). The team has performed well at this level, consistently earning upper table results including second-place finishes in each of the last two seasons. In 2004–05 MSV finished behind the second team squad of Hansa Rostock which declined promotion. This led to Neuruppin's participation in promotion playoffs for the third tier Regionalliga where they were defeated by FC Carl Zeiss Jena by scores of 0:2 and 1:2. However, the club was able to come away that season as Brandenburgpokal (Brandenburg Cup) winners by beating SV Babelsberg 03 2:1. That earned the team a place in the 2005–06 German Cup competition and on 25 August 2005 Neuruppin was beaten 0:4 in their first round match versus FC Bayern Munich in front of 33,000 spectators, the largest number to ever watch an MSV match. In the 2005–06 regular season the club delivered another strong performance, finishing a solid second to 1. FC Union Berlin. Unfortunately, an announcement by management of the association's poor financial state, which would prevent any application for a Regionalliga place, put a damper on the campaign and has contributed to the collapse of the team competitively in the current season following significant personnel changes. After being relegated from the Oberliga in 2006–07, the club appears to have sat out the following Verbandsliga season, competing in the Landesliga Brandenburg-Nord (VII) in 2008–09.

His father was Ted Hopkins, a popular stage performer; his mother was Violet Brodrick. Hopkins's one published novel is a philosophical thriller, The Divine and the Decay (London, MacGibbon and Kee, 1957), also published as The Leap! In this story, the fate of Britain hangs in the balance. Political parties are jockeying for power. A recently formed political party, the New Britain Party, is led by a visionary firebrand, Peter Plowart, who has planned the assassination of his arch-rival, the leader of his own political party. As Plowart anticipates the assassination, he realises that he must establish an alibi to show that he was somewhere else when it comes to pass. After examining the statistical tables of a meticulously researched government census, he decides to make a journey to a little island off the coast of Britain (modelled on one of the smaller Channel Islands) and give a speech to the citizens there. If everything is timed properly, he can rely on the inhabitants vouching for his presence among them when the assassination takes place. His encounter with the islanders, however, leads him to question and test his \\"will power\\". The novel received a negative response in various quarters. For example, Graham Hough of Encounter called it \\"an adolescent power-fantasy, extremely shoddily written\\" and expressed surprise that \\"even the naivest masturbations of the most unhappy young man should be able to take this openly Fascist form.\\" The publisher voluntarily recalled all known copies of the work and had them destroyed, in response to such allegations that it contained fascistic themes. Surviving copies from the publisher's initial print run are rare and can command prices in three figures.abebooks.com retrieved March 21, 2020 The novel was reprinted in 1984 under the title The Leap!, with an introduction by Colin Wilson and a new preface by Hopkins. Hopkins was also the author of \\"Ways Without Precedent\\", an essay included in Declaration, edited by Tom Maschler (London, MacGibbon & Kee, 1957), an anthology of non-fiction pieces by writers identified as Angry Young Men and Women. In \\"Aiming for a Likeness\\", his contribution to Colin Wilson: A Celebration (1988), he recalls how he arranged a meeting between Wilson and the portrait and fresco painter Pietro Annigoni.\\"Aiming for a Likeness\\" in Colin Wilson, a Celebration: Essays and Recollections (1988), ed. Colin Stanley. London: Cecil Woolf, pp. 47–49. In the mid-1980s, Hopkins edited and published The Monitor (originally titled The Arab Monitor), employing artist Cliff G. Hanley to design the covers. This was a news magazine focused on the Middle East. Hopkins has been grouped with the authors Colin Wilson and Stuart Holroyd, with whom he shared a house in London in the late 1950s. He was survived by his German-born wife, Carla Hopkins, who owns the antiques store they ran together for many years, and one of sisters, Mary Angela Thomas, living in San Francisco, California, plus a nephew and niece.

It is situated just west of the city of Schenectady on West Campbell Road (NY 337). History The Great Flats date back to 1661 when Van Curler, a statesman from Schenectady, New York along with 14 other persons applied to Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch Director-General of New York for permission to buy a tract of land known by its Dutch name of Groote Vlachte, (Great Flats) from the Indians. The area was originally an alluvial tract of land alongside the Mohawk River and contained several hundred acres of land. At that time it was a mainly cleared area which held water well enabling crops to be grown but had good drainage to prevent flooding. The area was settled by the Dutch and many farmsteads were set up As the towns of Schenectady and Rotterdam grew, the area became an important source of water for the towns in 1897 the first public wells were installed to utilize the Great Flats aquifer.Schenectady County planning, and still remains so today drawing more than 54 million gallons a day. In the 1960s a proposal was put forward to build a shopping mall called Rotterdam Square Mall on the land. The building of the mall was dogged with controversy when it was first proposed. The area was at the time a nature preserve and environmental groups were concerned that the building of the mall would endanger wildlife and pollute the wet lands. Eventually a permit was given containing numerous deed restrictions These restrictions, were put in place in order to protect this critical area, prohibit any further construction or excavation activities, improvements or changes of any kind or nature, except as permitted by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) for a wildlife sanctuary, park, and nature trails. Today, the area has been tided up and contains a variety of protected habitats for both woodland and wetland species of animals and birds. There is however constant pressure to develop land adjacent to the preserve and many environmental groups are involved in protecting it. Status The Great Flats Nature Preserve is classed as containing Class I wetland; Class I is the most environmentally sensitive of the five wetlands classifications. Wetlands serve as filters which remove pollutants from surface water and are important for the purity of aquifer water as well as for the health and cleanliness of the river.

It runs along the southern portion of the city of Page and turns southeast to the Navajo Nation. It enters the town of Kaibito in the reservation, but otherwise the stretch through the Native American reservation is mostly devoid of settlements. Following Indian Route 22, SR 98 intersects Indian Route 221 just north of its eastern terminus at US 160, the Navajo Trail. History SR 98 east of Kaibito The route was established in 1974, when portions of former Indian Route 22 were given to the Arizona Department of Transportation to establish as a state highway, as routed today. Portions of the route were realigned in Page when portions of the route were redefined as State Route 989. This portion in Page was later relinquished by ADOT to the city of Page.

Prince Frederick Adolf, Duke of Östergötland (; 18 July 1750 in Drottningholm – 12 December 1803 in Montpellier, France) was a Swedish Prince, youngest son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, a sister of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. He was given the title Duke of Östergötland. Life During his childhood, Frederick Adolf was under the tutelage of Ulrica Schönström. The Duke was described as \\"the most beautiful Prince in Europe\\" and was described as sensitive and spoiled by his mother. He and his sister, Sophia Albertina, were their mother's favourites and also devoted to each other. During family conflicts, such as the famous succession scandal regarding the questioned legitimacy of the Crown Prince in 1778, he and his sister were on their mother's side against that of their brothers Charles and Gustav. As a child, he had a weak health and a fierce temperament. His education became somewhat lacking. Frederik was made colonel in 1762, general major in 1768, general lieutenant in 1774, commander of the Västmanland regiment in 1775 and field marshal in 1792. He was given a minor role in the Revolution of 1772 of his brother Gustav III, who gave him the task of agitating in Södermanland and Östergötland. =Reign of Gustav III= He was given the title Duke of Östergötland on 8 September 1772 and the Tullgarn Palace as his residence. During the great succession scandal, the so- called Munck Affair in 1778, when the queen dowager Louisa Ulrika questioned the legitimacy of the Crown prince in reference to the rumors that Gustav III had convinced Adolf Fredrik Munck to impregnate the queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, Frederick sided with his mother and defended her before the king by pointing out that these rumors had not been invented by their mother but were in fact widespread rumors, and he reportedly said to his brother the king: \\"The entire city is talking of it, and it is commonly believed that You are not altogether man, and that it is because of this reason, that You have enticed the Queen to it to have an heir to the Kingdom.\\"Alma Söderhjelm (1945). Gustav III:s syskon. [The Siblings of Gustav III] Stockholm: Albert Bonniers Förlag. 23033 (Swedish) page 68 It was Frederick who convinced Louisa Ulrika to receive Gustav III on her deathbed in 1782, thereby accomplishing peace between them. His sister-in-law, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein- Gottorp, describes him as beautiful, with expressive eyes, an easygoing temper, and very handsome when he dresses properly, though often badly dressed in his private life, and gives the estimation that he would have been a greater social success, if he did not say so many suggestive things and had such a filthy mouth [that is to say, he used a sexually suggestive language], which he acquired because he had spent too much time with men, and had such a weakness for women and sex. He had no tasks in his life other than the ceremonial, and spent his life wasting money and involving himself in love affairs. Gustav III reportedly had no high opinion of his intellectual capacity. Frederick was an honorary member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and he did occasionally show a genuine interest in the affairs of the academy, as well as in the management of the Västmanland regiment. He devoted much time to country life on his estate, Tullgarn. His economic affairs were in bad shape, and in 1791 he was finally declared bankrupt and placed under administration until 1802. Frederick served in the Russo-Swedish War in Finland in 1788. During the Battle of Hogland, Fredrick wished to send reinforcements by fleet to aid his brother, Duke Charles. This was prevented, and Frederick left the army in protest to Gustav III, whom he referred to as a tyrant. He thereby came to belong to the opposition, and he also became involved in the planned coup by his sister-in-law to depose the monarch; the 1789 Conspiracy. In the autumn of 1789, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte prepared to depose Gustav III and place her husband Duke Charles upon the throne.My Hellsing (2013). Hovpolitik. Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte som politisk aktör vid det gustavianska hovet (Court Politics. Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte as a political actor at the Gustavian court) Örebro: Örebro universitet. (in Swedish) Her ideal was the Swedish Constitution of 1772, which she saw as a good tool for an enlightened aristocracy, and the war and the Union and Security Act had made her a leading part of the opposition. She cooperated with Prince Frederick Adolf and Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm. The plan was to force Charles to act as a symbol of the opposition to the Union and Security Act when the time was right. When the time arrived to make Charles act, however, he refused, which effectively discontinued the coup. =Reign of Gustav IV Adolf= In July 1793, he was given the position to chair the government during the journey of the king and the regent in the southern provinces, but nothing whatsoever was apparently accomplished during his tenure, and during a similar journey in 1794, he was not entrusted again.Alma Söderhjelm (1945). Gustav III:s syskon. [The Siblings of Gustav III] Stockholm: Albert Bonniers Förlag. 23033 (Swedish) In 1800, Frederick Adolf left Sweden for health reasons and travelled to Germany and then to France. He died in Montpellier in France in 1803. =Private life= Prince Fredrick Adolf is in fact most known in history for his love life. He was never married, and the ceremonial duties of his consort were performed by his sister Sophia Albertina. He had several plans to marry, but none of them was realised. His first proposal was to the Countess Ulla von Höpken, but she was married to another, and he accompanied his brother Gustav to France in 1770 to forget her. In 1774, he proposed to the cousin of his former love, Countess Sophie von Fersen, daughter of Axel von Fersen the Elder and sister of Axel von Fersen the Younger, the alleged lover of Marie Antoinette. She and her father refused, as they were afraid that she would be badly treated by his brother and mother, who was reluctant to give their consent, and because she was already engaged, and Frederick Adolf was sent to Italy in 1776 until she was married. (search for all versions on WorldCat) He lived from 1778 to 1795, in a happy relationship with the ballet dancer Sophie Hagman, who was well liked at court, and had a daughter, Sophia Frederica, with her. In 1780, he temporarily ended his relationship with Hagman and proposed to the noble Margaretha Lovisa Wrangel, with whom he became informally engaged. The King gave his permission to the marriage with the condition that it was postponed for a year, during which Wrangel was sent to Scania, with the thought that his brother would change his mind when the time was up. This was also the case, and Frederick Adolf returned to Hagman in 1781. (search for all versions on WorldCat) After his relationship with Hagman ended, he proposed to Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom in 1797, and after his relationship with Euphrosyne Löf ended, he proposed to Dorothea von Medem, dowager duchess of Courland in 1801, but none of the marriages was realized.

These processes include, but are not limited to, advertising, promotion, distribution, and product management. Core concepts in marketing Marketers may sell goods or services directly to consumers, known as business to customer (B2C marketing); commercial organisations (known as business to business marketing or B2B), to government; to not-for-profit organisations (Not-for-profit organization (NFP)) or some combination of any of these. =Actors and relationships= : At the centre of the marketing framework is the consumer lies the relationship between the consumer and the organisation with the implication that marketers must manage the way the organisation presents its public face. :: The consumer: Typically, the consumer refers to the end-user - but this may be an individual or group such as a household, family unit or organisation. In addition, marketers may need to consider the roles of influencers such as Opinion leaders who increasingly use means such as social media to develop customer to customer networks of influence. :: The organisation: may be represented by many different actors including: various sales personnel: Agent; Broker; Sales representative; Merchant; Retailer; Street vendor or Vendor :Selling situations & relationships: Depending on the nature of the business operations, many different types of actors are involved in a variety of selling situations involving a variety of sales personnel, who perform varied sales roles. Sales activities involve many different types of customer relationships - from simple transactional exchange through to long-term, enduring customer relationships. =Needs, wants and demands= Marketers typically begin planning with a detailed understanding of customer needs and wants. : A need is something required for a healthy life (e.g. food, water, shelter, emotional bonding); A want is a desire, wish or aspiration; When needs or wants are backed by purchasing power, they have the potential to become demands. =Nature of exchange= Exchange, the act of giving or taking one thing of value in return for another is central to marketing activities. Not all exchange involves Financial transactions, but may also involve barter, contra dealing or other form of trade. The object of exchange can include: Goods; services or experiences; concepts or ideas; causes and may even involve celebrity marketing =Perceptions of value= : Traditional thinking around the concept of value was that marketers created value through innovation, product design and manufacture and that Utility was embedded in products or services offered for sale. In this type of thinking, marketer's objective was to communicate a value proposition to potential buyers. However, recent thinking has changed the traditional perspective and now recognises that consumers may participate in the co-creation of value in a variety of ways. Consumers may derive value through usage and experience, known as value-in-use or may be involved in product design, known as participatory design. Foundation economic concepts Given that marketing has its roots in economics, it shares many foundation concepts with that discipline. Most practicing marketers will have a working knowledge of basic economic concepts and theories. ;Competitive advantages & comparative advantages Businesses seek to compete by achieving competitive advantages or comparative advantages. Competitive advantages often focus on reducing costs through achieving one or more of the following: Economies of scope; Economies of scale; Experience effects; First-mover advantages. Alternatively a business may seek to develop uniqueness through product differentiation or developing unique competencies such as market sensing, rapid market response or delivering superior customer value. superior value. ;Competition:types Different types of competitive markets can be identified: Duopoly; Monopoly; Monopolistic competition; Imperfect competition; Oligopoly ;Demand Understanding demand and supply is essential for determining market size and market potential as well as in the price-setting function. : The basic mechanics of consumer demand include: Demand curve; Demand-led growth; Demand response; Law of demand; Law of supply; Transaction costs. : Different types of demand functions include: Derived demand; Inverse demand function. ;Economic systems In Western economies, the capitalist economy dominates. However, other types of economic systems such as barter economies and the Sharing economy can be identified. ;Markets *Market *Monopsony *Oligopsony ;Value Value-in-ownership Value-in-use *Marketing ethics =Switching= *Switching costs **Switching barriers Planning levels and planning tools  =Planning levels = Marketing planning is just one facet of the overall company's planning. Marketing plans must therefore take their guidance from the overall strategic plan or business plan. Most companies produce both a strategic plan and a managerial plan (also known as an operational plan). The distinction between strategic planning and management planning is that they are two phases with different goals. : Strategic planning is fundamentally concerned with the policies that will improve the firm's competitive position. Strategic planning is sometimes called higher-order planning and is usually long-term planning (say 3–7 years) while management planning is short-term and may be carried out for a specific program (e.g. a sales or advertising campaign of a few weeks duration) or carried out annually. Strategic plans typically include a statement of the firm's vision and mission. The Marketing strategy is a plan that shows how the firm's marketing activities will help to achieve the overall strategic goals. : Marketing management is focused on developing the marketing program or Marketing mix (also known as the 4Ps) and is concerned with the implementation of specific action plans designed to achieve objective, measurable targets (SMART objectives). Marketing management plans are typically prepared on an annual planning cycle, but may be prepared for shorter periods for special events such as a product launch, a new logo, change to corporate livery or a repositioning campaign. =Strategic planning tools and techniques= Strategic planning requires sophisticated research and analysis to document the firm's current situation as well as to identify opportunities with the potential to be developed. Strategic research methods Strategic research is primarily concerned with the identification of new business opportunities and threats, which derive from the external operating environment. Accordingly, strategic analysts rely less on traditional market research methods. Instead, they use methods such as: Environmental scanning;Fahey, L., King, W. R. and Narayanan, V. K., \\"Environmental scanning and forecasting in strategic planning—The state of the art,\\" Long Range Planning, Vol. 14, No. 1, 1981, pp. 32–39 Marketing intelligence (also known as competitive intelligence)Fleisher, C. and Bensoussan, B.

Branches of Marketing  The book titled, The Marketing Book, 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016 edited by Michael J. Baker and Susan Hart identifies the distinct branches of marketing practice as: * Consumer marketing (general Marketing) * Business marketing; also known as Business-to- business marketing and Industrial marketing (which also includes Business-to- government marketing) * Relationship marketing * Environmental marketing; also known as Green marketing ) * International marketing; also known as Global marketing) * Services marketing; which includes not-for-profit marketing and Destination marketing) * Retailing * Social marketing (which includes Cause- related marketing) For a more detailed breakdown of the relevant topics for each of these key branches of marketing, see Branches of Marketing: Detailed Topics on this page. For special applications of marketing including marketing of specific types of products (e.g. agricultural marketing, faith based marketing, pharmaceutical marketing, political marketing, sports marketing, etc.,) or marketing to specific target groups (e.g. marketing to children, marketing to older people, LBGT marketing) see: Special applications of marketing practice). Marketing orientations Marketing orientations are the philosophies or mindsets that guide and shape marketing planning and marketing practice. Some marketing historians believe that different philosophies have informed marketing practice at different times in marketing's history. Although there is no real agreement amongst scholars about the precise nature or number of distinct marketing orientations, the most commonly cited include: * Marketing orientation (See section: Marketing orientation) ** Marketing concept * Production orientation (also see sections: Production orientation or Production orientation) *Sales orientation; also known as the Selling orientation (also see sections: Selling orientation or Sales orientation) * Societal marketing (also see section: Societal marketing) **Sustainable market orientation **Corporate social responsibility * Relationship orientation (also see Relationship orientation section) ** Customer relationship management  The marketing management framework Marketing planning or the process of developing a marketing program requires a detailed understanding of the marketing framework including Consumer behavior; Market segmentation and Marketing research. In the process of understanding the consumer market to be served, marketers may need to consider such issues as: =Consumer basics= *Brand awareness *Consumer *Consumerism *Customer knowledge *Consumer socialization *Consumer switching *Consumer purchase funnel *Customer engagement *Demographics *Demographic profile *Ethical consumerism *Lifestyle =Consumer decision-making= The main steps in the consumer's purchase decision process are: Need or problem recognition → Information search → Evaluation of alternatives → Product/Brand Choice → Post purchase behaviour *AIDA (marketing) *Brand awareness *Consumer confusion *Choice Modelling *Decoy effect *Impulse purchases *Prospect theory *Window shopping =Influences on consumer decision-making= Consumers purchase decisions are influenced by a range of internal and external factors including: :Internal influences ::*Attitudes; Beliefs; Demographics; Aspirational age; Aspirational Brand; Culture; Learning; Motivation; Opinion leaders; Risk perception and Loss aversion; Needs; Social class; Values :External influences ::*Culture; Family; Reference groups; Subculture; Peer group; Pester power; Time =Market research and marketing research= Marketing research refers to research activities designed to understand the marketing environment, including competitors, the socio-cultural environment and the politico-legal operating environment.

A number of commercial companies provide such data which typically includes proprietary software designed to interrogate the data and backed by algorithms that support different types of segmentation approaches. These commercial databases are often country or region specific. Popular geo-demographic segmentation databases include: * Acorn (UK) * Claritas Prizm (US) * Experian (Europe, US) * Mosaic (Asia- Pacific) Popular psychometric tools include: * Roy Morgan Research (Asia Pacific) * VALS (US) * Values Modes =Statistical techniques used in segmentation analysis= * Neural Networks * CHAID (Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector) * Canonical Analysis * Choice Modelling * Cluster analysis * Conjoint analysis * Cross tab * Discriminant analysis * Factor analysis * Intent scale translation * K-means * Latent Class Analysis * Logit analysis * Multi dimensional scaling * Preference-rank translation * Preference regression * Random Forests * Structural Equation Modeling  Marketing management: The marketing program (also known as the marketing mix or the 4 Ps) The marketing program, also known as the marketing mix or the 4 ps consists of the product, price, place and promotion.

The steps in a basic new production development process are: :Idea generation (or Ideation (creative process)) →Concept screening→ Concept testing → Business analysis → Product development → Market testing → Commercialization and may include a Soft launch The NPD process can be applied to: :Products: New product development; Design :Services: Service innovation; Service design :Environmental goods or services: Eco-innovation; Ecodesign; Lean product development A recent trend in NPD is the use of participatory design, also known as co-design or co-operative design, which involves stakeholders such as employees or consumers in the design process. Sources of new product ideas include: Research and development; Consumers or Users; distributors, suppliers or crowdsourcing. Types of innovation *Blue Ocean Strategy *Disruptive innovation NPD represents a high risk activity. It requires substantial investment and a list of product failures suggests that the probability of failure is relatively high. New product adoption and diffusion In order to develop a superior understanding of how new products are adopted by the market place and the factors that influence adoption rates, marketers often turn to a number of models or theories of the adoption/diffusion process: *Bass diffusion model *Diffusion (article) *Diffusion of innovations (article) **Early adopter **Hype cycle *Technology acceptance model (article) *Technology adoption life cycle (article) *Technology life cycle *Quality function deployment *Crossing the Chasm (Book title) =Legal protection of new products and brands= New product development, including the design of product features, manufacturing processes, packaging design etc. involves creative work and therefore constitutes intellectual property.

She was formally Duchess consort of Saxe-Lauenburg by her marriage to Duke Magnus II of Saxe-Lauenburg.  Biography  During her early childhood, she, as well as her siblings in the royal nursery, were primarily under the care of her mother the queen's trusted nurse, Brigitta Lars Anderssons, her mother's cousin lady Margareta, and the noble widow Ingrid Amundsdotter.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi över Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 After the death of her mother in 1551, she as well as her siblings were placed in the care of Christina Gyllenstierna and then under her aunts Brita and Martha Leijonhufvud before her father's remarriage to Catherine Stenbock.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasadöttrarna (The Vasa Daughters). Falun: Historiska Media. (In Swedish) They were then under the responsibility of their stepmother and, more precisely, the head-lady-in- waiting Anna Hogenskild. During the Northern Seven Years' War, the Danish queen dowager Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg suggested a peace treaty by marriage between her younger son, the Danish monarch, and Sophia. However, she made the suggestion without her son's knowledge, and he did not support the idea. In March 1566, Sophia became engaged to Duke Magnus II of Saxe-Lauenburg, who had long been in the service of Eric. The marriage took place in a double wedding when her half brother King Eric XIV married Karin Månsdotter on 4 July 1568. Eric may have arranged the marriage of Sophia and Magnus because he needed support for his controversial marriage to Karin Månsdotter. It is also possible that he feared he would not have the wedding guests he wanted unless he had Sophia's wedding conducted in parallel. In the negotiations, Magnus promised to defend Karin Månsdotter. Sophia did not want the marriage—she refused and stalled preparations for the wedding, which prevented it from taking place in June 1567 as first planned when Eric married Karin for the first time. Eric therefore ordered that, since Sophia refused to prepare for the wedding, preparations should be made for her—and her wedding would take place together with his own second, public wedding ceremony with Karin. =Marriage= At the wedding in Stockholm in July 1568, Sophia walked in the procession with her sister Elizabeth—after Karin, who walked first with queen dowager Catherine Stenbock, which was considered unsuitable to rank. Neither Sophia nor her sister Elizabeth attended Karin's following coronation. During the deposition of Eric XIV, Sophia, Magnus evacuated Elizabeth and Catherine Stenbock by boat, and took them to the rebellious John in Uppsala. John officially claimed, that Eric had planned to give them as hostages to Russia, in place of John's own consort, which he had tried before. The marriage became extremely unhappy. Reports describe Magnus as a typical brutal German mercenary, notorious for his abuse of his subordinates. Early on, it became known that he subjected Sophia to spousal abuse—apparently motivated by severe jealousy. According to the chronicle of Aegidius Girs, Sophia became insane by the treatment she was given by Magnus, who: \\"...showed his princess all unkindness, spit and shameful slander, that she of the sorrow was caused great weakness of the head.\\" In 1571, Magnus pawned her jewelry to finance his conquest of Sachsen-Lauenburg. He soon spent her money, and Sophia was forced to constantly ask her family to finance his ambitions. In 1575, her brother King John III granted Magnus the Swedish fief Sonnenburg on Ösel to make him leave Sweden, but he was soon cast out from Ösel because of his brutal rule. Magnus soon became unpopular with Sophia's family because of how he treated her. He also came in conflict with John III in 1576 when he forbid his subjects in Sophia's fief from paying taxes and executing their working duty for the crown. In 1577, reports said that Magnus prevented Sophia from receiving letters from her family and accepting invitations, and isolated her from the outside world. =Later life= In 1578, John III had Magnus arrested, imprisoned, and exiled from the country. He forced Magnus to leave his and Sophia's son in her care, and put Sophia's fiefs in her sole name. John III granted her the fiefs Ekolsund Castle and Venngarn Castle. In 1581, reports had Magnus spreading rumors in Germany about Sophia. John had the Emperor ban Magnus from making slanders against Sophia that could blacken her name and endanger her son's inheritance and her right to her dower lands. Sophia devoted later life to her son Gustav. She worked to ensure his rights in Sachsen-Lauenburg and his future. She kept Gustaf with her rather than send him away as was the custom, and was said to spoil him to a point where his character was destroyed. In 1595, she came into conflict when Gustaf persuaded her to grant him half of her fief—which she retracted with the assistance of her brother Charles. Floor hatch in Strängnäs Cathedral leading to her brother Charles IX's family crypt, where Sophia's remains also were interred Sophia lived the rest of her life at Ekolsund Castle. In contrast to her siblings, she supported the marriage between John III and Gunilla Bielke in 1585. Sophia was said to have suffered from a mental illness of some kind. Aside from the chronicle of Aegidius Girs, this is not mentioned much. However, correspondence from her siblings asks her several times not to mourn too much, to prevent her getting ill. In contrast to her brother Magnus, who was acknowledged as mentally ill and was isolated because of it, Sophia participated occasionally in court life, such as when she participated in a public dinner with the royal family in Kalmar at Easter 1586. She is not described as an efficient administrator of her estate and court: she was often forced to ask for economical assistance because of her misused lands, and her court was unstable with frequent changes of staff: she changed the head butler twenty-one times and the housekeeper twenty-three times during these years. In 1597, she was granted the fiefs Lagunda and Håbo. She became a widow when her absent husband died in 1603. =Issue= Sophia had six children, but only one of them lived past infancy: * Gustav of Saxe-Lauenburg, (31 August 1570- 11 November 1597), governor of Kalmar, unmarried but had issue Ancestry  References   Further reading  * Sophia 1547 Category:1547 births Category:1611 deaths Category:House of Vasa Category:Duchesses of Saxe- Lauenburg Category:Incidents of domestic violence Category:Violence against women in Europe ","title":"Princess Sophia of Sweden"},{"id":"9811251","text":"Minat al-Qal'a (اشدود; lit. \\"the harbour of the fort\\"), sometimes wrongly named Qal'at al-Mina, is a medieval coastal fort protecting the port known as Ashdod-Yam (lit. \\"Ashdod-on-the-Sea\\"), which was historically separate from Ashdod proper but whose archaeological remains are today located on the southern beach of the sprawling modern city of Ashdod.

Sofas would also fight, in varying capacities, in the armies of later Mandé states such as the Bamana and Wassoulou empires. Etymology The word sofa translates into English as \\"father of the horse\\" (\\"so\\" means horse, and \\"fa\\" means \\"father\\") or \\"guardian of the horse\\". This term stems from the original function of the sofa as a caretaker for the horse or horses of Mandinka cavalry commanders called \\"farari\\". Sofa in the Mandinka empire of Mali Sofas make their first appearance in oral and written records during the formation of the Mali Empire. Sofas were recruited from \\"jonow\\" (slaves) captured in battle or bought from afar. They could be depended on in most instances for obedience, since their livelihood depended entirely on their master. The institution of slavery in the Mali Empire heavily rewarded loyalty, and jonow could rise to civil or military positions of prominence. Jonow became part of their master's clan, and were often freed after a certain number of years. As part of the clan, jonow were expected to accompany their master's into battle and handle his horse and weapons. Initially forbidden from engaging in direct warfare, sofa eventually made up the majority of Mali's infantry army. As infantry, they were armed with bows and arrows by the state or, more accurately, royal clans devoted to the state. In the forest and swampy areas of the Mali Empire, cavalry was minimized or altogether abandoned making sofas the exclusive instrument of war. Sofas were equipped with two quivers, and their bow was small by European standards. It could not fire very far or even powerfully, so sofas utilized deadly poisons and fired in arcs to give the arrows strength. Sofas also used flaming arrows, especially against fortifications that were often little more than thatch or wooden palisades. Some sofas fought as cavalry, at least after being freed, such as Mansa Sakura whom started out his military career as a jonow of the Keita clan. He was freed by Sundjata Keita, became a cavalry commander of some renown and eventually usurped the throne of Mali. Sofa in the Mané empire of Kquoja During the 16th century, warriors from the crumbling Mali Empire invaded what is now Sierra Leone and Liberia. This resulted in the establishment of a loose federation of Mané states all paying homage to a single leader in a type of empire called Kquoja by visiting Europeans. The Mané came equipped with the tactics and equipment of the Mali Empire, but were forced to rely almost exclusively on infantry strategies in the jungle terrain. One of the many institutions they brought with them was that of the sofa. Conquered people were conscripted into Mané armies as \\"sumbas\\" to strengthen a force that was forever on the move. The sumbas were forced to engage in ritual cannibalism, which permanently alienated them from the Mané ruling class. By the end of the 17th century, the Mané had conquered nearly all the indigenous cultures. This resulted in the spread of Mandé language and the end of a single Kquoja authority as the Mané were absorbed into the native landscape. Sofa in the Bamana empire of Segou The Bamana people inherited much from their close relations, the Mandinka, in civic and military culture. They formed their own empire 1640, which filled the vacuum left by the Mali and Songhai empires. By 1712, the state had crystallized into a formidable state that borrowed much in military structure from the Mali Empire. Sofas were used heavily in its armies as infantry and support troops, which allowed the Bamana to dominate much of modern-day Mali. Sofa in the Dyula empire of Wassoulou The institution of the sofa survived into the late 19th century among Dyula in the Wassoulou region between the modern states of Mali, Guinea and Ivory Coast. Under the leadership of Samori Ture, the Dyula formed the Wassoulou Empire and successfully challenged French ambitions in West Africa until 1898. The sofa under Samori were organized into standing armies of slaves, much like those in Mali six centuries earlier and armed by the state. However, instead of bows and arrows, Wassoulou sofas went to war armed with modern rifles, which they put to good use against African and European enemies.

It was built in 1851 on the land where the remains of the burned down St. Patrick's Inn had resided since 1747. It is a -story \\"U\\"-plan building with nine bays at the south front facade. The building is constructed of wood joists with brick and masonry load bearing walls with Greek Revival elements. It was converted from a hotel in the mid-20th century, and enjoys the college atmosphere of the nearby University of Delaware campus. The St. Patrick's Inn was said to house famous historical figures such as George Washington and in 1843 Edgar Allan Poe stayed a night here. The Deer Park logo is based on Poe's classic poem \\"The Raven\\". In the Fall of 1764, Mason and Dixon made their base of operations in Delaware at the St. Patrick's Tavern in Newark, where the Deer Park Tavern now stands. Tavern scenes in Thomas Pynchon's 1997 novel Mason & Dixon are consistent with at least one contemporary account of their enjoyment of the taproom. The first railroad line built through Newark in 1869 is close to the building, and helped to escalate the hotel's popularity. At this time, The Deer Park was considered one of the finest hotels on the east coast. Much history surrounds the Deer Park including rumors that the basement was used as part of the Underground Railroad before the Civil War. In 1955, the Amalgamated and Condensed Chemist's Club charter at the University of Delaware's founding chapter was written in the old dining room of the Deer Park. Founders, \\"in the good old Boswellian tradition\\", included Carling, LePera, Jordan, Lafferty, Baldwin, Hoffner, Baird, Skinner, deBrabender and Wilson. Today, the patrons include University of Delaware students and staff, business people and locals. The nightly atmosphere varies with bands, DJs and drink specials that bring a hefty crowd each night of the week. In the 1970s, local bands such as George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers played the back room. On October 5, 2010 MSNBC political TV show The Rachel Maddow Show broadcast its show live from the second floor of the Deer Park, which was chosen due to Delaware's upcoming U.S senatorial election. Maddow remarked on her show: \\"we live for the intersection of politics and beer\\". It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

It is a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit organization committed to supporting vulnerable populations around the world. ACTED works in 37 countries responding to emergencies and crisis situations, whilst also supporting recovery, rehabilitation and development efforts. ACTED was initially established in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1993, distributing coal and flour to bakeries to cope with bread shortages. Activities quickly expanded around the country and then to wider Central Asia. From here, ACTED's work spread to Africa, Central America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In 2017, ACTED became the highest ranked new entry in the \\"NGO Advisor\\" Top 500 NGOs, at #33, and was marked \\"one of six organizations to watch\\". ACTED has its head office in Paris and network offices in Geneva, London, Ottawa and Washington, D.C.. The NGO implements programmes in 37 countries in Central, South and Southeast Asia; South America and the Caribbean; the Middle East and North Africa; West, Central and East Africa; and Europe. In 2019, ACTED implemented more than 400 projects reaching directly 20.7 million people, with a €315 million budget and more than 6,200 staff. ACTED is also one of the seven member NGOs of Alliance2015, along with Ayuda en Acción, Cesvi, Concern Worldwide, Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation, Hivos, People in Need and Welthungerhilfe. This represents a strategic partnership dedicated to fighting poverty more effectively by cooperating on various levels, working together in the least developed countries and influencing and campaigning together at EU level.  Vision and Mission  Since its creation, ACTED has been committed to provide to providing immediate humanitarian assistance to support those in urgent need and protect people’s dignity, while co-creating longer-term opportunities for inclusive and sustainable growth and investing in people’s potential. ACTED's mission is to save lives and support people in meeting their needs in hard-to-reach areas. ACTED’s organizational vision is a 3Zero world: Zero Exclusion, Zero Carbon, Zero Poverty. Zero Exclusion, because nobody should be left behind; Zero carbon because we only have one planet; Zero Poverty, because poverty should not hold back potential. The 3Zero vision of ACTED is based on three main aspects: * Promoting inclusive and low carbon growth; * Building upon the capacities of every human being and developing human capital; * Accelerate access of the most vulnerable to social and technological innovation.  Areas of intervention  = Approach = ACTED's approach is to \\"go the last mile\\", an approach rooted in ACTED's history: ACTED was born in Kabul against the backdrop of the forgotten crisis of Afghanistan, as the result of a will to go where others did not want to go, and to act differently - with an area-based approach, no mandate restriction, and by investing in local knowledge and expertise, promoting a “Think outside the box” approach. ACTED supports vulnerable communities in hard-to-reach areas throughout the world and accompanying them in building a better future by providing a response adapted to specific needs. By ensuring the link between Emergency, Rehabilitation and Development, ACTED's teams guarantee that interventions made in a situation of crisis are useful and sustainable, because only long-term support – by remaining in the area post emergency and involving communities – can end the poverty cycle and pave the way towards sustainable and inclusive growth. With more than 25 years experience working closest to the needs of the most vulnerable worldwide, ACTED contributes to reaching the Global Goals, advocating for an integrated approach to humanitarian action, for co- construction and global partnerships towards the sustainable development of territories. = Sectors of intervention = ACTED is a multisectorial NGO that was created with a no mandate restriction to allow flexibility in providing the most adapted response to concrete needs in each situation. In line with its 3Zero vision, ACTED’s sectors of intervention include:  Humanitarian action  In emergencies, ACTED responds to save lives, with special attention to the most vulnerable and marginalized. ACTED’s humanitarian response includes preparedness and early action, emergency response, recovery, and encourages future resilience and equitable development.  Access to basic services  Access to basic services includes basic access to drinking water, basic sanitation and hygiene facilities, essential health care, education (as a minimum primary school education), energy, social welfare schemes (commonly referred to as safety nets) and basic mobility and in urban contexts additionally access to basic waste collection services and broadband internet access. Activities under this thematic area aim at improving quality and coverage of services offered by public (usually national and sub-national government actors and agencies), private (e.g. service provider companies) or philanthropic (such as NGOs in the absence of governmental or private service providers) actors to ensure they can meet basic needs.  Inclusive economic opportunities  Ensuring individuals have adequate skills and capacities to access available livelihood opportunities, and that markets are able to offer decent employment or self- employment opportunities for unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled individuals. Inclusive economic opportunities mean that they should be in the sectors in which the poor work (e.g. agriculture); occur in places where the poor live (e.g. undeveloped areas with few resources); use the factors of production that the poor possess (e.g. unskilled labour); and reduce the prices of consumption items that the poor consume (e.g. food, fuel and clothing).  Circular economy  A circular economy is a systemic approach to economic development designed to benefit businesses, society, and the environment. In contrast to the 'take-make-waste' linear model, a circular economy is regenerative by design and aims to gradually decouple growth from the consumption of finite resources. It is based on three principles: 1. Design out waste and pollution; 2. Keep products and materials in use; and 3. Regenerate natural systems. Circular systems employ reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling to create a close-loop system, minimizing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and carbon emissions.  Sustainable infrastructure  Construction, rehabilitation or retrofitting of infrastructure (beyond household level) for production of green energy or for more efficient resource use and consumption. Such infrastructure can improve environmental conditions and therefore people’s health and quality of life. It also supports a green economy, creates job opportunities and enhances biodiversity.  Citizen-driven climate action  “Greening personal lives” by promoting “lifestyle changes” and build momentum for systemic change to mitigate climate change.  Collaborative and resilient ecosystems management  Human activities that adversely affect ecosystem resilience such as reduction of biodiversity, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, land use, and anthropogenic climate change are increasingly causing regime shifts in ecosystems, often to less desirable and degraded conditions. ACTED aims to ensure that ecosystems and natural resources are regenerated, consumed and protected in a more sustainable manner so that local populations can responsibly benefit from them to meet their needs while conserving the ecosystems for future generations.  Strengthening institutions and civil society  Government institutions are more accountable and responsible to the needs of citizens. Citizens and civil society are empowered to participate in management of collective resources and governance. While empowering citizens to make demands and hold to account those who are meant to be responsible for delivering services and at the same time supporting local public institutions to provide better, more effective services to their constituents, ACTED specifically encourages different stakeholders – from groups of citizens, CSOs and private sector to (local) governments and supportive sector institutions – to work effectively together in co-constructing ways to act collectively and in their own best interest and thus be agents in, dynamic development processes.  Peace, stability and justice  ACTED aims to prevent conflict, support post- conflict political stabilization and promote protective living environments by improving trust between and within communities, reducing risk of violence, preventing outbreak of conflict and promoting basic principles of the rule of law such as access to justice so that people are able to have their voice heard, exercise their rights, challenge discrimination or hold decision-makers accountable.  Countries of intervention  As of October 2020, ACTED is present in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Congo (Rep.), Dem. Rep. Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, occupied Palestinian Territory, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Yemen. = Footprint in major crises = ACTED has responded to some of the main humanitarian crises over the past 25 years, in countries and areas including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, the DRC, the Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan, among others.  Principles and Values  Independent, private and non-profit, ACTED respects a strict political and religious impartiality. ACTED’s work is guided by 4 core values: responsibility, impact, enterprising-spirit and inspiration. In line with its 4 core values, ACTED adheres to the principles of independence, impartiality, non-discrimination, free and direct access to victims, ethics, professionalism, anti-corruption, transparency and accountability.

The channel was A&E;'s first international venture. Sky Sports 2 began broadcasting all day in 1997, requiring other networks to move to another channel. The History Channel shared transponder 24 with Sky Soap and the Sci-Fi Channel. The launch of Sky Digital allowed the channel to significantly increase its broadcast hours. On 26 October 2006, History Channel HD launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The HD version was launching across Europe from October 2007, beginning in the Nordic region on 13 December 2007, offering a schedule separate from the standard-definition version. In January 2008, History Channel HD launched in the Netherlands. In November 2008 the History Channel was re-branded as History, and the high- definition channel became History HD. The company behind the channel was known as The History Channel (UK) Limited until July 2009, when it was renamed AETN UK to reflect the company's several channels.

Plot The film takes place in and around Cape Town and a nearby township, Khayelitsha. The film centers around two teenage friends, the younger Madiba (Junior Singo) and the elder Sipho (Innocent Msimango). One day, as they are playing alongside the railroad tracks, they find a dead body. With him they find a gun with one bullet and a video camera. Sipho takes the gun and Madiba takes the camera, which he puts inside a wooden toy camera to make it seem a not-working toy. Sipho seems to harmlessly joke about the gun at first, but begins spending more time in Cape Town, robbing parking meters and paying for glue to sniff. He eventually starts living in abandoned places in Cape Town with a group of thugs. Madiba films the world around him, finding beauty in both Khayelitsha and Cape Town. He tries many filming techniques and is skilled, but finds his videos very personal and does not normally let other people see them. While in Cape Town, he meets and forges an unlikely friendship with a white Cape Town girl, Estelle (Dana de Agrella) from a rich family, who gets into conflict with her racist father about this. Sipho uses the gun to rob people. Madiba disapproves and does not want any of the stolen money, but still considers him his friend. One of Sipho's robberies goes wrong and he is killed. In the end Madiba and Estelle run off and take a train together.

As there was no funding available to turn the many blocks of this street into a local Greenway, the local community worked with the City of Vancouver planning department to implement a demonstration project called \\"Blooming Boulevards\\". This demonstration project allowed residents to garden the frontages of their yards between the street and the sidewalk. This section of street contains the wires and ducts of the city, and this was the first time that gardening on these city owned frontages was allowed. The program was so successful that Blooming Boulevards are now city policy and boulevards are now gardened throughout the city. Bike Route  The Windsor Bikeway is a 4.3 km north/south bike route that follows Glen Drive and Windsor Street from Great Northern Way to 43rd Avenue and was chosen for its proximity to Knight Street. This route provides a connection for the Off-Broadway and 10th Avenue Bikeways to the Midtown/Ridgeway and Inverness Bikeways. The Windsor Bikeway passes through Mount Pleasant and Kensington-Cedar Cottage neighbourhoods and goes by Memorial Park South. Measures along the proposed bikeway to reduce vehicle speeds and to help cyclists cross busy arterials include traffic circles, corner bulges, centre medians, speed humps, and traffic lights controlled by cyclists and pedestrians. Estimated cycling time for the full length of the Windsor Bikeway is 18 minutes. A leisurely walk from 12th Avenue to 49th Avenue along Windsor Way will take 30 minutes.  History  Without the funding for a greenway, the community along Windsor Street participated in a demonstration project where they gardened the city owned boulevards in front of each of their residences. This Blooming Boulevard project was wildly successful. The community was also successful in getting a Community Public Art Grant. Public Artist Karen Kazmer created \\"Windsor Way-Moments, Memories and Objects\\" which are attached to many of the street poles along Windsor Street. The illustrations attached on the street poles are of neighbours' hands, objects in the neighbourhood, and things that have significance to people in the neighbourhood. A survey was completed in 2001 of local residents to gauge support for the bike path. City Council considered a recommendation from staff in 2003.Proposed Windsor Bike Route - January 7, 2003 Windsor Street was selected over other streets near the major north-west transportation corridor, Knight Street, for a number of reasons including: * it is one of the only continuous north/south streets in proximity; * it is one of the better streets for grades (particularly between 33rd and 37th Ave); * there are several parks and schools on this route (e.g. Charles Dickens Elementary School); * local residents strongly supported the bike route; and, * there are significant efforts by local residents to beautify the streetscape through the City's \\"Blooming Boulevards\\" program.  Public art  Public art has been installed along the Windsor Way bike route to further beautify the corridor and calm traffic. This work was completed in two phases. Phase 1 was led by the Mt. Pleasant Community Centre Association, which led what was called \\"one of the most successful community public art projects ever\\",2003 Community Public Art Grants installing metal banners on street lamps along Windsor Street. Funding was approved by the City in 2002.Community Public Art Grant Recommendations from 2000 Capital Budget Phase 2 of the public art portion of this project built on the \\"Windsor Way/Art Way\\" plan. To support this, the City of Vancouver approved funding ($15,000) for the project in 2004.

In the case of matrix algorithms, a pivot entry is usually required to be at least distinct from zero, and often distant from it; in this case finding this element is called pivoting. Pivoting may be followed by an interchange of rows or columns to bring the pivot to a fixed position and allow the algorithm to proceed successfully, and possibly to reduce round-off error. It is often used for verifying row echelon form. Pivoting might be thought of as swapping or sorting rows or columns in a matrix, and thus it can be represented as multiplication by permutation matrices. However, algorithms rarely move the matrix elements because this would cost too much time; instead, they just keep track of the permutations. Overall, pivoting adds more operations to the computational cost of an algorithm. These additional operations are sometimes necessary for the algorithm to work at all. Other times these additional operations are worthwhile because they add numerical stability to the final result. Examples of systems that require pivoting In the case of Gaussian elimination, the algorithm requires that pivot elements not be zero. Interchanging rows or columns in the case of a zero pivot element is necessary. The system below requires the interchange of rows 2 and 3 to perform elimination. : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & -1 & 2 & 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & -11 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 2 & -1 & -3 \\\\end{array} \\\\right] The system that results from pivoting is as follows and will allow the elimination algorithm and backwards substitution to output the solution to the system. : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & -1 & 2 & 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 2 & -1 & -3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & -11 \\\\end{array} \\\\right] Furthermore, in Gaussian elimination it is generally desirable to choose a pivot element with large absolute value. This improves the numerical stability. The following system is dramatically affected by round-off error when Gaussian elimination and backwards substitution are performed. : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccc} 0.00300 & 59.14 & 59.17 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5.291 & -6.130 & 46.78 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right] This system has the exact solution of x1 = 10.00 and x2 = 1.000, but when the elimination algorithm and backwards substitution are performed using four-digit arithmetic, the small value of a11 causes small round-off errors to be propagated. The algorithm without pivoting yields the approximation of x1 ≈ 9873.3 and x2 ≈ 4. In this case it is desirable that we interchange the two rows so that a21 is in the pivot position : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccc} 5.291 & -6.130 & 46.78 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.00300 & 59.14 & 59.17 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right]. Considering this system, the elimination algorithm and backwards substitution using four-digit arithmetic yield the correct values x1 = 10.00 and x2 = 1.000. Partial and complete pivoting In partial pivoting, the algorithm selects the entry with largest absolute value from the column of the matrix that is currently being considered as the pivot element. Partial pivoting is generally sufficient to adequately reduce round-off error. However, for certain systems and algorithms, complete pivoting (or maximal pivoting) may be required for acceptable accuracy. Complete pivoting interchanges both rows and columns in order to use the largest (by absolute value) element in the matrix as the pivot. Complete pivoting is usually not necessary to ensure numerical stability and, due to the additional cost of searching for the maximal element, the improvement in numerical stability that it provides is typically outweighed by its reduced efficiency for all but the smallest matrices. Hence, it is rarely used.Edelman, Alan, 1992. The Complete Pivoting Conjecture for Gaussian Elimination is False. Mathematica Journal 2, no. 2: 58-61. Scaled pivoting A variation of the partial pivoting strategy is scaled pivoting. In this approach, the algorithm selects as the pivot element the entry that is largest relative to the entries in its row. This strategy is desirable when entries' large differences in magnitude lead to the propagation of round-off error. Scaled pivoting should be used in a system like the one below where a row's entries vary greatly in magnitude. In the example below, it would be desirable to interchange the two rows because the current pivot element 30 is larger than 5.291 but it is relatively small compared with the other entries in its row. Without row interchange in this case, rounding errors will be propagated as in the previous example. : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccc} 30 & 591400 & 591700 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5.291 & -6.130 & 46.78 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right]  Pivot position  A pivot position in a matrix, A, is a position in the matrix that corresponds to a row–leading 1 in the reduced row echelon form of A. Since the reduced row echelon form of A is unique, the pivot positions are uniquely determined and do not depend on whether or not row interchanges are performed in the reduction process. Also, the pivot of a row must appear to the right of the pivot in the above row in row echelon form. References * R. L. Burden, J. D.

Released theatrically on November 24, 1941, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures.  Plot  Woody stays behind to swim while the other birds in the forest migrate south for the winter. Just after the other birds leave, the cold of winter sets in instantly, to the point that Woody's swimming hole freezes solid after he jumps in (\\"Must be hard water\\", he remarks). Woody does not worry, because he has stored up plenty of food. However, a snow storm enters his house and makes off with all of his possessions, food included. Two weeks later, Woody is delusional and literally staring starvation, personified as something vaguely resembling the Grim Reaper, in the face. A month later, a hungry cat happens upon Woody's cabin, and conspires to eat the woodpecker. The famished Woody, however, plans just as quickly to eat the cat, and the two have at it. Eventually a moose appears at Woody's open door, and the starving cat and woodpecker chase after it to capture and eat it. Afterwards, however, the meal proves not to be enough to satisfy both Woody (whose voice is suddenly much different) and the cat, who instantly resume their game of trying to eat each other. Voices Danny Webb was the voice of Woody Woodpecker; Korny Kat and the Moose, and bird voices were likely done by Sara Berner, Bernice Hansen, Jack Mercer, Pinto Colvig, and Mel Blanc.  Production notes  Like most of the early 1940s Lantz cartoons, Pantry Panic carried no director's credit. Lantz himself has claimed to have directed this cartoon, which features animation by Alex Lovy and LaVerne Harding, a story by Ben Hardaway and Lowell Elliott, and music by Darrell Calker. Pantry Panic was the third cartoon in the Woody Woodpecker series, featuring an early, garish Woody Woodpecker design. It was the first short with Danny Webb as Woody's voice. However, the woodpecker's famous laugh (provided by Mel Blanc) would continue to be recycled until 1951, when Grace Stafford rerecorded a softer version. Woody's \\"Guess Who?\\" (also Blanc), however, would continue to be used in the opening titles until the end of the series in 1972.Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \\"1941\\". The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia Pantry Panic would be reworked in 1946 as Who's Cookin' Who?. The starvation personification would also reappear in the remake as well as 1951's The Redwood Sap.

It is based in the Star Wars film The Phantom Menace. It is the last game manufactured by WMS industries (Williams and Bally labels) before the announcement to close their doors on October 25, 1999. The jet bumper rule of the 1.4 software reminds players of that date: The number of points for spelling Jar Jar is 19,992,510; This is the date 25-10-1999, the same day WMS announced the closing of their pinball branch. The game was also available as a conversion kit for Revenge From Mars which included a Star Wars Episode I playfield, game ROMs, manual, cabinet decals, translite and a manual plunger. Gameplay The goal of the game is to become a Jedi Spirit. To reach the Spirit level one must battle through Youth, Knight, and Master levels, fighting Darth Maul in a light saber battle at each level. To get to the duel one must spell \\"J-E-D-I\\" by completing the various modes started at the Holoprojector or being randomly awarded a letter through various other means. The included modes are: *Ground Battle *Sub Escape *Hangar Escape *Jar Jar Juggling *Podracing *Space Battle *Sith Droids *R2-D2 Astrodroid *Queen’s Game *Jedi Musical Chairs *Watto’s Chance *Destroyer Droids *Gungan Battle =Multiball= Multiball is started by putting a ball into each of the saucers (Mos Espa Market and Watto’s Junk Shop). If more than one player is playing it is possible to “steal” the other players multi-ball prep work. It's also possible to shoot the active ball into a saucered ball so both come flying back. Useful in a multiplayer game, less so in a single player (and counter-productive if it happens during a Jedi Battle). When multiball is started, the center target lights up for a 1,000,000 jackpot. If 2 (or 3 if the ball saver is still running) balls drain without making the first jackpot the player will be offered the opportunity to restart the multiball by shooting either saucer. Note that the restarted multiball is only two balls but allows the player to hit the skill shot again. The pattern for jackpots: *Center target only – 1,000,000 points *Left and Right ramps – 1,000,000 points each *Center target, Left and Right ramps – 1,000,000 points each with a Super Jackpot awarded for the last of the three 5,000,000 points. After one has lost two of the three balls in play, the multiball ends and the saucers go dark. To relight the saucers one needs to hit either saucer once for each multiball that has been started. So to lock the ball in the Junk Shop for the second multiball, one first needs to hit either the Junk Shop or the Market once first.

Biography Grave of Charles Shambaugh at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Shambaugh joined the army in Indiana County, Pennsylvania and served in Company D of the 11th Pennsylvania Reserves. His Medal of Honor was officially awarded on July 17, 1866, and he is one of only two recipients of the medal from the 11th Pennsylvania Reserves, the other being Henderson C. Howard. He is buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.). His biography as listed in the Prospect Hill Cemetery database is as follows: Born in Prussia on August 25, 1839, Charles Shambaugh immigrated to the United States in 1847, when he was about 8 years old. Nothing is known about his life here until the time of the Civil War. On June 10, 1861, he enlisted in the Pennsylvania Reserves, where he served as a corporal in the infantry. He was wounded on August 30, 1862, during the Second Battle of Bull Run. Six weeks later, on October 13, 1862, he left the service on a disability discharge. Four years later, on July 17, 1866, he was awarded a Medal of Honor for his meritorious actions at Charles City Crossroads, Virginia, June 30, 1862. The citation was \\"capture of flag.\\" It appears that Shambaugh returned to Pennsylvania after his discharge, for it is known that a daughter, Jennie, was born to him there in 1873. Another daughter, Lizzie, was born in Kansas in 1877. (We know nothing about his wife, who apparently was deceased by the time the 1900 census was taken.) By 1890 he had come to the District of Columbia and was living at 6121 Street, NE. According to the City Directories for 1890 and 1891, in 1890 he was employed as a watchman; in 1891 he worked as an elevator operator. By 1900 he had moved to 1108 K Street, NE. He died October 12, 1913, in Hyattsville, Maryland, at age 73. He was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

In late 2006 he joined HIZAKI's solo project, HIZAKI grace project. He then started a solo career before pausing all musical activities at the end of 2007. He returned in 2009, after changing his stage name to Shaura, as part of the duo XOVER. After his last band VII-Sense disbanded on mid-2012, in 2012, August he officially wrote on his blog that his music career is finished and there was no reason for him to get back on stage, now he took up fishing.  Activities  = Moi dix Mois = In 2002, Juka was recruited to join Mana's project, Moi dix Mois. Like his band colleague Kazuno he was a newcomer to the Japanese music scene. While Juka was in Moi dix Mois, they produced three singles, two albums and two live DVDs as well as countless live concerts with the band, even in Germany and France. Juka left Moi dix Mois right after the Invite to Immorality Tour Final concert on April 30, 2005. The official reason given for his departure was musical differences. As a result of lacking a vocalist, Mana's fellow band members Kazuno and Tohru also decided to leave the band soon after. From there, Moi dix Mois had to be formed completely anew. On March 20, 2013 he made an appearance as part of the encore of the final show of Moi dix Moi's Le Dixieme Anniversaire Live 2012-2013 tour performing a short set as part of a reunited original line up of the group followed by a second encore where they were joined on stage by the group's current members for a performance of the title track of the Pageant single. = HIZAKI grace project = At the end of 2006, guitarist HIZAKI recruited Juka as vocalist for solo project, HIZAKI grace project. In early 2007 they released a new album named Dignity of Crest. A live DVD named Monshou was released on May 5, 2007. It contains the complete live footage of HIZAKI grace project's tour final concert on February 17. They released a second album called Ruined Kingdom on September 19 which contained some live tracks and three new songs, which are the last recordings featuring Juka. He officially left the band after the concert at Omotesandou Fab on October 5, 2007. During the \\"Nihon Tanbi Kakumei\\" tour in November 2007, Juka performed as support vocalist along with Kamijo and Kaya. = Solo career = In the middle of February 2007 Juka announced the start of his solo career on Kamijo's record label Sherow Artist Society, while continuing activities with HIZAKI grace project. He also announced the release of his first maxi single \\"Aravesque\\" on March 28, 2007, which was produced by Kamijo, HIZAKI and Juka himself. The three tracks provide a large style selection. While the first song \\"Aravesque\\" is reminiscent of Moi dix Mois' gothic sound, the second track \\"S\\" leans in the direction of heavy metal music. The third track \\"Aimless\\" has much in common with a French chanson and doesn't share any kind of style with one of the first two tracks. Furthermore, all tracks are instrumental. Another release called Luxurious in the shape of a mini album was released in June 2007. He released his second single \\"Saint Croix\\" on October 31, 2007. Juka announced he would be pausing all musical activities at the end of 2007 due to personal matters; all future plans were on hold/cancelled. = Node of Scherzo = In March 2007, the Node of Scherzo (ノード・オブ・スケルツォ) event took place. Juka takes the role of vocalist alongside Kamijo and Kaya while HIZAKI and Jasmine You support the three on guitar and bass. According to Kamijo, the show is supposed to be a theatrical show combined with music and illumination effects. While Juka and Jasmine You represent the dark side, Kamijo and HIZAKI form their opposite as the light side. Between them stands Kaya personifying beauty. A certain focus is cast on the tragic love story of Juka and Jasmine You. When the three vocalists performed a new specifically created song at the end of the show, the song found so much approval of the audience, that they decided after a second Node of Scherzo show in May 2007 to record this song on a CD. It was finally released on October 31, 2007. The buyers of all Halloween releases by the labels Reverie and Sherow Artist Society, which were \\"Carmilla\\" (by Kaya), \\"Saint Croix\\" (by Juka), Lyrical Sympathy (by Versailles) and the \\"Node of Scherzo\\" single, were given the possibility to obtain a special live clip DVD by sending all the coupons found on the obi slips wrapped around the CD case and five 80 Yen stamps to the label by December 12, 2007. The DVD contained a 5 minutes live clip accompanied with the Node of Scherzo song. Further performances of the song could be seen during the national tour \\"Nihon Tanbi Kakumei\\". = XOVER = XOVER was a duo formed in 2009 with Kouichi (Everlasting-K, ex:Laputa), and marked Juka's return to music after changing his stage-name to Shaura. XOVER released one mini-album titled XGATE on July 22, 2009. They then released an album called Aureola on October 21. But after releasing a live DVD in November 2009, XOVER disbanded. = VII-Sense = Seventh Sense was intended to be a new band by Juka and fellow ex:Moi dix Mois member Kazuno. However, due to Juka withdrawing himself from the music scene, this band was canceled and the Omnibus album that Seventh Sense would have been featured on now features Juka's song \\"Suimenka\\" instead. Juka would release a \\"best of\\" album on February 6, 2008, called Seventh Sense. In 2010 Seventh Sense was finally formed, stylized as VII-Sense. Their first release was the single \\"Black Bird\\" on March 24. The other members included guitarists Erina (ex:Dio - Distraught Overlord) and RayX, Kaz on guitar and piano, bassist Masato (ex:support for XOVER) and Mikage on drums (ex:Hizaki Grace Project, Kisaki Project). On May 2012, the band disbanded. On August 28, Shaura wrote on personal blog that he would not return to the music scene. The entry was deleted and Shaura instead wrote that he wanted to make new band. However, this entry was also deleted.

The \\"Inner Sanctum\\" franchise originated with a popular radio series and all of the films star Chaney Jr. The film is one of several films based on the novel Conjure Wife by Fritz Leiber, the others include Night of the Eagle (1962) and Witches' Brew (1980). Co-star Evelyn Ankers had previously worked with Chaney in Ghost of Frankenstein, when Chaney played the monster, and The Wolf Man, when Chaney played the wolf man. Synopsis Professor Norman Reed (Chaney, Jr.) falls in love with and marries a woman named Paula (Gwynne) while on vacation in the South Seas. When they return to his hometown, she is greeted coolly by much of the community, especially Ilona (Ankers), who felt that Reed was hers. Strange things begin to happen, including the death of a colleague, which turns people against her even more, especially as she believes in voodoo and other supernatural phenomena. Reed must work hard to prove her innocence and find the real culprit behind the strange doings.

This rushed production schedule was the norm at Universal. Inner Sanctum films cost approximately $150,000 to produce, and shooting schedules were routinely 12 days. Actress Evelyn Ankers would later say that she found playing a villainess rather difficult. When LeBorg would say \\"action\\" and Ankers would try to exact a menacing look, she and co-star Anne Gwynne would almost inevitably start laughing. Universal never hired her to play a villain again.

Cihang Zhenren supposedly originated as a Daoist xian \\"transcendent; immortal\\" and became a bodhisattva because of his endless willingness and effort in helping those in need. In some Daoist records, Cihang Zhenren was said to one of the twelve disciples of Yuanshi Tianzun. In some Daoist temples, under the statute of Cihang Zhenren, there usually is a golden lion with eight additional smaller heads, which is known as the Nine Headed Golden Lion. It is said that the Immortal Cihang Zhenren can appear in the human realm in 32 different human forms (三十二应), some of which are male, others female. There are three anniversaries of Cihang Zhenren that have been celebrated – The first is on the nineteenth day of the Flower Moon (Lunar Second Month). This was the day Cihang Zhenren prayed for the dead to be liberated from hell and blessings for the living (other legends say it was his birthday). The second is on the nineteenth day of the Lychee Moon (Lunar Sixth Month). This was the day he subjugated Ningbo Xianzi (a sea spirit that caused maritime disasters) and successfully gained enlightenment. The third is on the nineteenth day of the Chrysanthemum Moon (Lunar Ninth Month). This was the day Cihang Zhenren achieved immortality.

History  Formed in 1980 as The Living Room by Peter Astor (vocals, guitar), Bill Prince (bass), Andy Strickland (guitar) and Dave Morgan (drums), the band changed its name when they discovered a local music venue also called The Living Room. The venue was being run by Alan McGee, with whom The Loft struck up a friendship and played several gigs for. After signing to McGee's fledgling Creation Records label, the debut single \\"Why Does the Rain?\\" was issued in 1984. \\"Up the Hill and Down the Slope\\" was issued the following year, earning both band and label some critical success. A national tour as the opening act for The Colourfield was intended to give the band further exposure, but tensions within the band led to a sensational split live onstage of the Hammersmith Palais, on the final date of the tour.  After the split  Almost immediately, Peter Astor and Dave Morgan formed a new band, The Weather Prophets, who were also signed to Creation. In 1989, Creation finally issued a compilation of their work entitled Once Around the Fair: The Loft 1982-1985, with Magpie Eyes 1982-1985 appearing on Rev-Ola in 2005. Guitarist Strickland became a music journalist and formed The Caretaker Race, and Prince formed The Wishing Stones. In 2006, the band unexpectedly reformed, playing a handful of gigs and releasing a single of new material on Static Caravan Recordings. The band continues to perform occasionally. In 2015, to celebrate 30 years since their \\"Up The Hill and Down the Slope\\" single topped the indie chart, the band played shows in New York in May (headlining the NY Popfest in Brooklyn) and in London in June before recording their third BBC radio session - this time for fan and supporter, Gideon Coe, on BBC 6 Music. The Loft is featured heavily on the Creation Artefact CD compilation released by Cherry Red Records in September 2015. The band remains open to further shows and recordings.

One of the oldest continually producing community theatres in the United States, its building, also known as the Little Theatre, was added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1991. Theatre Jacksonville is based in the neighborhood of San Marco. It puts on numerous productions throughout the year and runs a children's camp called Camp Theatre Jacksonville every summer. History The Little Theatre company was founded at Jacksonville, Florida in 1919 and then incorporated as \\"The Little Theatre of Jacksonville\\" in 1926. Cigar magnate Carl Swisher was the benefactor for a new building in the San Marco neighborhood, which was started in 1927. However, it was more than ten years before the first performance was staged at the new facility. On January 4, 1938, Boy meets Girl opened in what is now a historic U.S. theater located at 2032 San Marco Boulevard. In early 1969, the name of the company was changed to \\"Theatre Jacksonville, Inc.\\" and the theatre was re-incorporated. Mayor Hans Tanzler issued a proclamation naming Theatre Jacksonville as Jacksonville's \\"Official Theatre\\" in 1972, a distinction reconfirmed by all succeeding mayors. On July 12, 1991, the Little Theatre building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The $500,000 Harold K. Smith Playhouse Endowment for facility maintenance was established in June, 1997. In October, 2000 the theatre Facade renovation was completed and the facility was formally dedicated as the Harold K. Smith Playhouse.

The bill was introduced February 27, 2007 in the 110th Congress by Representative Rick Boucher (D-VA). On March 19, 2007, the bill was referred to the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. The bill was not reintroduced. Boucher emphasized that the bill would not make circumvention an act of fair use, but would instead redefine which acts qualify as permissible circumvention, stating that :“The Digital Millennium Copyright Act dramatically tilted the copyright balance toward complete copyright protection at the expense of the Fair Use rights of the users of copyrighted material. The reintroduced legislation will assure that consumers who purchase digital media can enjoy a broad range of uses of the media for their own convenience in a way which does not infringe the copyright of the work.”\\"Boucher's latest 'digital rights' bill,\\" Stanford Law Center for Internet and Society History The FAIR USE Act is Boucher’s third attempt at reforming provisions within the DMCA, the previous two being the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Acts (DMCRA) of 2003 and 2005.\\"Boucher to float a new version of DMCRA,\\" Analoghole Previously, Boucher co-sponsored the “Benefit Authors without Limiting Advancement or Net Consumer Expectations,” or “BALANCE Act,” which sought to amend the DMCA to account for noninfringing circumvention.109th Congress H.R. 4536 Cosponsors The Digital Media Consumers' Rights Acts stressed the necessity of adequate labeling on media bearing digital rights management (DRM) and similar protections to prevent consumer confusion. Both amended the DMCA to include exceptions for acts of circumvention that furthered consumers’ exercise of fair use rights.107th Congress, H.R. 5544 The DMCRA of 2003 included a section of fair use amendments, including amendments to the exemptions described by Section 1201(c) of Title 17.Title 17, Chapter 12, § 1201(c) The bill exempted research into “technological measures” from infringement and enabled consumers to circumvent DRM, and qualified that using services for noninfringing uses would not be a violation. The bill also explicitly stated that manufacturing and distributing hardware or software capable of noninfringing uses would likewise not be a violation.Congress H.R. 107 The revised DMCRA of 2005 included a similar section of \\"fair use amendments\\", but did not make mention regarding users of noninfringing circumvention services. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) criticized both incarnations of the bill, arguing that the language was too permissive and would “legalize hacking and piracy.”\\"The Boucher Bill is Back,\\" Alex Curtis for Public Knowledge Provisions The FAIR USE Act consists of two main provisions: redefining copyright infringement and amending copyright circumvention exemptions. =Section 2: Copyright infringement= Section 2 would amend Section 504(c)(2)Title 17, Chapter 12, §504(c)(2) of Title 17, and would prevent courts from levying statutory damages in cases of secondary infringement. see H.R. 1201 Section 2 would also amend Section 501 by adding that \\"no person shall be liable for copyright infringement based on the design, manufacture, or distribution of a hardware device or of a component of the device if the device is capable of substantial, commercially significant noninfringing use.\\" In effect, this would reverse the Supreme Court’s decision in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. (2005), which held that \\"one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright ... is liable for the resulting acts of infringement,\\"MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster Ltd., which has gradually come to be interpreted to mean that any distribution of an object capable of infringement is liable for any resulting infringement.\\"FAIR USE Act analysis: DMCA reform left on the cutting room floor,\\" Tim Lee for ars technica With the Grokster decision null, the prevailing standard regarding secondary liability would return to the Court's decision in Sony v. Universal (also known as the Betamax case). Section 2 echoes the Court's language in Sony, stating specifically that one may not be held liable for copyright infringement \\"based on the design, manufacture, or distribution of a hardware device or of a component of the device if the device is capable of substantial, commercially significant noninfringing use.\\" =Section 3: DMCA amendments= Section 3 first codifies the set of circumvention exemptions granted by the Librarian of Congress as part of the 2006 DMCA rule making process. Section 3 also amends the DMCA to add exceptions for six types of circumvention. Circumvention by libraries and archives, to skip objectionable content, to transmit over a personal network, to gain access to public domain works, for public interest work and research, and for preservation are added as a new set of exceptions.see H.R. 1201 (I) Libraries and archives Section (I) allows libraries and archives to circumvent copyright for the purposes of compiling audiovisual works that are in a library's collection for educational classroom use by an instructor. Educational compilations for college film and media courses\\"Educational uses of media\\" University of Pennsylvania were exempt by the Librarian of Congress under Section 1201 of the DMCA, but that exemption was set to expire in 2009. Section(I) not only made the exemption permanent, it expanded the exemption to apply to compilations for coursework at all grade levels, in any subject area. (II) Objectionable content Section (II) allows specifically for circumvention via hardware or software that skips objectionable content. Circumvention for the purposes of avoiding objectionable content became an issue in 2006, when a Denver judge ruled that the edited versions of films sold by companies such as CleanFlicks and CleanFilms were not considered fair use.\\"The Controversy over Movie Editing\\" These companies, along with a handful of others, removed objectionable content (such as nudity and profanity) from DVDs and sold the edited versions to consumers. In its decision, the court did not address the legality of companies who offered software or hardware that would “read” unaltered media and skip objectionable content. Section (II) allows the sale of hardware, such as modified DVD players sold by CleanPlay, and software, like downloadable plug-ins, that would skip such content.\\"CleanFlicks Update: The Battle Continues,\\" Director's Guild Association Monthly (III) Personal network Section (III) allows circumvention for the purpose of storing or transmitting media over a personal network, but explicitly prevents the uploading of media “to the Internet for mass, indiscriminate redistribution.\\" (IV) Public domain works Section (IV) allows for circumvention that enables access to a public domain work, or a compilation of works that are primarily in the public domain. Arguably, Section (IV) would expressly allow initiatives such as Google Books, which was originally pioneered in 2004 as a database to increase the availability of, and readers' access to, public domain works.\\"About Google Books\\" (V) Public interest work and research Section (V) is similar to a broader version of the third prong of fair use. It allows circumvention that is carried out to gain access to a work of substantial public interest solely for the purposes of \\"criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarship, or research.\\" The language of Section (V) is ambiguous, which led some critics to worry that the language was too broad, potentially enabling students to circumvent copyright to access books, films, and music for coursework, or allowing professors to create course packs without obtaining permission from publishers.\\"FAIR USE Act Aims To Clarify Copyright Limits,\\" Thomas Claburn, Information Week. (VI) Circumvention for preservation Section (VI) allows circumvention for purposes of preservation by a library or archives, with respect to works in its collection.\\"Library Copyright Alliance Strongly Supports HR 1201, the FAIR USE Act,\\" Association of Research Libraries Since the DCMA was passed, librarians across the country protested the limited circumvention rights they were afforded. The Association of Research Libraries addressed the problem of preservation head-on, arguing that “preservation is one of a library’s most critical functions... the DMCA is interfering with our ability to preserve these works.” see above The provisions of Section (VII) would effectively eliminate librarians' problems with preservation of works in a library's collection. Criticism The FAIR USE Act was subject to criticism of both proponents and opponents of DMCA reform. Proponents of DMCA reform critiqued the bill for being \\"wishy-washy\\". Despite the included amendments, several of which arose in response to public protest, the Act did not allow for circumvention for ripping personal copies for cross-media consumption (i.e. ripping a DVD for use on a video phone or laptop), which some considered the biggest problem with the DMCA.\\"Fair Use Act Would Allow In-Home Content Sharing, not DVD Ripping,\\" Julie Jacobson for CEPro The bill was also criticized for not maintaining the more strongly worded exemptions enumerated in previous incarnations of DMCA reform legislation, in particular, those regarding the makers and distributors of circumvention technology, which meant that “a film studies professor would be permitted to use software such as Handbrake... However, developing or distributing Handbrake in the United States would still be a crime.”see above Opponents of the bill focused on problems with the scope and breadth of its language. As with previous Boucher- sponsored bills, the RIAA argued that the bill would “repeal the DMCA and legalize hacking.\\"\\"RIAA opposes new fair use bill,\\" Grant Gross for Infoworld See also * List of intellectual property legislation proposed in the United States Congress * Digital Millennium Copyright Act * Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act * INDUCE Act * Public Domain Enhancement Act * PRO-IP Act References External links FAIR USE Act * The US Library of Congress page on this bill: * The OpenCongress page on this bill: * The GovTrack progress on this bill: United States Code * Title 17, Chapter 12, § 1201: * Title 17, Chapter 12, § 504: Category:Proposed legislation of the 110th United States Congress Category:United States proposed federal intellectual property legislation Category:United States federal copyright legislation Category:Fair use ","title":"FAIR USE Act"},{"id":"9812082","text":"Fullscreen may refer to: * Fullscreen (aspect ratio), an aspect ratio of 4:3 (as opposed to widescreen (>1.37:1)) * Fullscreen, in computing, a display which covers the full screen without the operating system's typical window- framing interface * Fullscreen (company), an American entertainment company and multi-channel network ","title":"Fullscreen"},{"id":"9812088","text":"Badger were a British rock band from the early 1970s. They were co-founded by keyboardist Tony Kaye after he left Yes, with bassist and vocalist David Foster. The latter had been in the Warriors with Jon Anderson before he co- founded Yes. Foster later worked with the band on their second album Time and a Word (1970). Kaye had worked on a solo project by Foster that was never released. The pair found drummer Roy Dyke, formerly of Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, and Dyke suggested guitarist and vocalist Brian Parrish formerly of Parrish & Gurvitz which later became Frampton's Camel (after Parrish left P&G;) on guitar. The new band began rehearsing in September 1972 and signed to Atlantic Records. One Live Badger (1973)  Badger's first release was the live album, One Live Badger, co-produced by Jon Anderson and Geoffrey Haslam, and was taken from a show opening for Yes at London's Rainbow Theatre. In the progressive rock genre, five of the songs were co-written by the whole band, with a sixth by Parrish (initially written for Parrish & Gurvitz). The cover art was done by Roger Dean, the artist responsible for many of Yes's album covers, although Kaye left Yes before their partnership with Roger Dean. # \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" (lead vocals: Parrish) – 7:50 # \\"Fountain\\" (lead vocals: Foster) – 7:22 # \\"Wind of Change\\" (lead vocals: Foster) – 7:15 # \\"River\\" (lead vocals: Parrish) – 6:50 # \\"The Preacher\\" (lead vocals: Parrish) – 3:59 # \\"On the Way Home\\" (lead vocals: Parrish) – 7:39 Reissue of the first album One Live Badger. Published on CD in 1998 with the same songs in the same order. Label: Seven Dollar – 008  White Lady (1974)  By 1974, the band had been reduced to Kaye and Dyke. They recruited bassist, Kim Gardner, who had worked with Dyke in Ashton, Gardner and Dyke. Paul Pilnick, formerly of Stealers Wheel, joined on guitar, as did singer Jackie Lomax. Lomax proceeded to turn them into the type of R&B;/soul band he had used on his solo albums. The band became a vehicle for Lomax's songs and singing. During this period, they released one LP, White Lady, on Epic Records, produced by Allen Toussaint. All ten songs were written or co-written by Lomax. Guests on the album included Jeff Beck (contributing a guitar solo to the title track). # \\"A Dream of You\\" - 4:15 # \\"Everybody, Nobody\\" - 3:22 # \\"Listen to Me\\" - 4:48 # \\"Don't Pull the Trigger\\" - 4:05 # \\"Just the Way It Goes\\" - 4:41 # \\"White Lady\\" - 4:47 # \\"Be with You\\" - 3:41 # \\"Lord Who Give Me Life\\" - 3:04 # \\"One More Dream to Hold\\" - 4:05 # \\"The Hole Thing\\" - 6:09 However, before the album's release, the band had split into two factions, with Lomax and Gardner leading a short-lived band called White Lady, before Lomax returned to a solo career. \\"White Lady\\" b/w \\"Don't Pull the Trigger\\" was released as a single in May 1974.

Zsa Zsa Gabor plays a dual role, Stalin's nurse and lover as well as her twin sister who, unaware of Stalin's plot, hires an ex–O.S.S. agent (Lex Barker) to find her sister. Plot In Moscow, four terrified women prisoners are brought to the office of Joseph Stalin, who chooses Dasha, the smallest and most beautiful, and punishes her by shaving off her black hair. Moments later, plastic surgeon Dr. Petrov leads Stalin into the operating room and transforms his face so that he is unrecognizable. After his handlers announce publicly that Stalin has died, they secret him away to a hideout, where Greta Grisenko serves as his nurse. Meanwhile, Greta's twin sister Lili continues searching for her, as she has been ever since Russian troops invaded their home country of Lithuania and took Greta, against her will, to Moscow. Earlier, Lili had engaged private investigator Steve Anderson, an American living in Berlin, to find Greta, and now locates him there and asks why he has failed to contact her with information about her sister. Steve has discovered that Greta is working in Moscow and, despising Communists, refuses to work with Lili until she convinces him that her sister is an innocent victim of the Russians. Steve takes Lili to the home of Mischa Rimilkin, a one-armed espionage agent who reveals that Greta has been working for Petrov. Upon receiving assurance from the U.S. Army that Lili is not a spy, the men divulge to her that Dasha, now confined to a mental hospital, claims that Stalin has been surgically altered and is living clandestinely with Greta. The next day, Lili once again pleads with Steve to help her locate Greta, but Steve protests that the job is too dangerous. He is won over, however, by Lili's clever idea to force Stalin into action by announcing over the radio that he is alive. As they have hoped, Stalin hears the broadcast and orders his henchman, Igor Smetka, to kill Steve. Mischa then brings Steve and Lili to Abensburg, Germany, where Stalin's son Jacob has been living in secret since the Allies captured him during World War II. On the train, Steve and Mischa note the suspicious presence of a nun wearing combat boots, and once in Abensburg, Mischa follows the nun into a church. At the same time, Steve and Lili visit Jacob, who hates his father and, after conceding that he may be alive, warns them that they are in grave danger. That night, Mischa and Steve vie for Lili's attention, and although Steve eventually wins a kiss, he then insults her, prompting her to slap him. From Lili's hotel room window, Steve spots the nun approaching and races downstairs, where he finds that Mischa has been knocked out. Steve overpowers the nun and removes the disguise, revealing his old cohort, Russian Tata Brun. Tata explains that he has been ordered to kill Steve in return for permission to see his exiled family, and the two agree to part without violence. In the next few days, Mischa, Steve and Lili study old films of Stalin to become familiar with his mannerisms. Before one screening, Steve spots Igor and, suspecting impending danger, orders Lili to return to the hotel. Although Steve and Mischa wait in the screening room for an attack, none comes. Soon after, Tata arrives with a cab driver who announces that Lili has been abducted by Igor. Steve notifies the police and agrees to act as bait to attract Stalin's men. Surrounded by undercover agents, Steve and Mischa walk the streets near the screening room, and as planned, they are attacked. With Tata's help, they capture one of the assailants, whom Tata recognizes as one of the Communist agents who tortured him. Tata now returns the favor, torturing the man into confessing that Stalin is in the Greek mountains. After the agent dies from his injuries, Steve and Mischa travel to the mountains, and there learn from bistro owner Count Molda that a nearby monastery was taken over years earlier by a mysterious group. Curious, Steve and Mischa sneak into the monastery at night, but are immediately captured by the waiting Molda, who introduces them to three other men and their women companions. Unable to discern which man is Stalin, Steve offers them all political asylum in the West, but the men respond by showing them Tata, who has been tortured and killed. They then place Steve and Mischa in a cell next to the imprisoned Lili. That night, Lili receives a visit from Greta, and although Lili is thrilled to see her sister, Greta attacks her. When Lili pulls at Greta's hair, Greata's wig comes off in her hands, and Lili realizes that her sister has been enslaved and brainwashed. Although the women whip Steve mercilessly, he refuses to talk, and when Steve returns to the cell, Mischa uses his fake arm to bludgeon the guard. The two men then manage to free Lili, and together they stumble onto a room full of stolen cash and burn the currency in the lit fireplace. Just then, Greta bursts in and kills Mischa, forcing Steve to slay her. Steve and Lili are soon recaptured and taken to Molda, who orders them killed. Just then, however, Jacob enters and shoots Stalin's henchmen. Molda steps forward, tenderly addressing Jacob as \\"son,\\" but Jacob is unmoved and orders his father at gunpoint into a waiting car. As Steve and Lili follow them in another car, Stalin tries to reason with his son, but Jacob resists, denouncing his father's violence and campaign of terror against their people. Steve pulls up to the car and shoots at Jacob to make him stop. Trapped, Jacob willingly steers the car over a cliff. While Steve and Lili watch the fiery explosion, they note a nearby Biblical inscription reading \\"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\\" See also * List of American films of 1957 References External links * Category:1957 films Category:1950s thriller films Category:American thriller films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Cold War films Category:Films set in Germany Category:Films set in Greece Category:Films set in the Soviet Union Category:Films about Joseph Stalin Category:Secret histories ","title":"The Girl in the Kremlin"},{"id":"9812111","text":"State Route 181 (SR 181) is a highway in Cochise County, Arizona that runs from its junction with US 191 east of Pearce to the Chiricahua National Monument.

The highway continues heading towards the north with the occasional curve towards the northeast before continuing north. When SR 181 reaches an intersection with SR 186, SR 181 turns towards the east. It continues towards the east until it reaches its eastern terminus at the Chiricahua National Monument boundary.  History  The route was established by the Arizona Department of Transportation between 1935 and 1938 with its current routing from SR 81 (now US 191) to the Chiricahua National Monument. Since then, the routing has not been changed and SR 181 remains as when it was defined.

Inkle weaving was referred to in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost. A table-top inkle loom was patented by Mr. Gilmore of Stockton, CA in the 1930s but inkle looms and weaving predate this by centuries. The term \\"Inkle\\" simply means \\"ribbon\\" or \\"tape\\" and refers to any warp-faced woven good made on any type of loom, from backstrap to box-looms. Inkle weaving is commonly used for narrow work such as trims, straps and belts. Equipment right Inkle looms are constructed as floor-standing and table-top models. The loom is characterized by a wooden framework upon which dowels have been fastened. These dowels will hold the warp threads when the loom has been dressed. left One of the dowels, or a paddle, is constructed so that its position can be adjusted. This tensioning device will be taken in as weaving commences and the warp threads become shorter. Additional equipment includes yarn of the weaver's choice, yarn or thread for forming heddles and a shuttle to hold the weft. A notebook is also handy for charting weaving diagrams. Process The inkle loom is threaded with warp threads according to the weaver's design, alternating between yarn that can be raised and lowered and yarn that is secured in place through the use of the heddles. The raising and lowering of these warp threads creates the shed through which the weft thread will be carried on a shuttle. The weaver should make one pass with the shuttle with each opening of a shed through the raising and lowering of threads. A simple raising and lowering of threads creates a plain-weave band in which warp threads are slightly offset. Weft threads are only visible at the edges of the band and the weaver may wish to take this into account by warping threads that will form the edges in the same color as the weft. As the weaving commences, the warp threads will shorten on the loom and the weaver will need to adjust the tension periodically. As the inkle band progresses, it will also get closer to the heddles. The weaver will also need to advance the warp thread along the bottom of the loom to open up new weaving space. Helene Bress recommends loosening the tension when you are ready to advance the warp. Once you have done so, tighten the tension again and resume your weaving. There are other more advanced techniques in which, instead of merely allowing warp threads to alternate in their up or down positions, individual threads are brought to the surface to form what is called a \\"pick up\\" pattern. One side of the band will show the exposed surfaces of warp threads while, on the other side of the pattern, the weft thread will be visible. Using a supplemental weft thread that will come up over the top of certain warp threads, brocaded designs can also be worked into the inkle band. An inkle loom is also useful in the practice of tablet weaving for its added portability. Simply thread the warp onto the loom but use weaving cards instead of alternating between free-hanging and heddle-secured yarn. Uses Inkle bands are quite strong and can be used in applications where a flat band is desired. Popular modern uses are guitar and camera straps, or, for particularly narrow bands, colorful shoelaces. Traditionally inkle weaving also served as belts and reins. Re-enactors use it as trim for garments and other textiles.  See also  *Loom References Further reading * Bress, Helene. Inkle Weaving. Flower Valley Press / Scribner, 1975, * Brown, Rachel.

Founded by Jock McKeen and Bennet Wong, the centre offers programs for personal and professional purposes, including Certificate and Diploma Programs in Group Facilitation and Counselling Skills. Institutional Registration and Credits The Haven Institute is registered in the province of British Columbia as a Private Training institution in accordance with the Private Training Act (SBC 2015) Chapter 5. This registration is governed by the Private Training Institutions Branch (PTIB) of the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. History In 1983, two physicians, Bennet Wong and Jock McKeen purchased the Taylor Bay Lodge on Gabriola Island, British Columbia, and transformed it into a waterfront resort and conference centre.*. They called it \\"a resort with a difference\\" because people could enter into the activities at whatever level they chose. Some people came with their families to enjoy a country resort; groups and agencies held conferences; others attended the numerous residential self-awareness seminars. Still others returned for training in counseling; currently, 95 people have graduated from the Diploma program offered by The Haven Institute.*. There are over fifty visiting faculty members teaching in this nontraditional, open atmosphere. Some notable ones have been Virginia Satir, Erv and Miriam Polster, Paul Reps, Carl Whitaker, Paul Lowe, James Bugental, Thomas Szasz, Bill O'Hanlon, Maria Gomori and Joanna Macy. The Haven Symposium has featured Joseph Chilton Pearce,*. Margaret Wheatley,*. and Dan Millman.*.*. The Wong- McKeen Phoenix Auditorium, Haven's performing arts theatre, has seen performances by Ann Mortifee, Laurie Anderson, Eric Bibb, Victor Wooten, Shari Ulrich and Leon Bibb.*. The Haven Institute Press publishes books by founders Bennet Wong and Jock McKeen and others.*. The Core Programs for the Institute were developed by McKeen and Wong. Programs have been offered at The Haven with Chinese translation since the early 1990s, and numerous Asian people have attended as participants, and trainees. *.*.Joann Peterson became the Director of Education in 1992, and oversaw the training of over 1200 interns and assistants in group and individual counselling until her death in 2007. The programs have continued to develop and broaden.*. In 2003, The Haven Foundation was established as a federally recognized Canadian nonprofit charity. In 2004, Wong and McKeen and their three sons, transferred the ownership of The Haven Institute into the Haven Foundation so that the facility and their work could continue in perpetuity under independent guidance.,*. In 2008 The Haven Institute celebrated its 25th anniversary.*. Participants from all over the world continue to attend both the core programs and other programs offered by visiting faculty. The Haven hosted the TEDx Gabriola conference in March 2013.*. *. Teaching principles The methods in the courses are derived from a great variety of sources in the fields of humanistic psychology and transpersonal psychology, as well as the more traditional fields of psychology, religious studies, drama, music and art. The techniques used cover a broad spectrum, including gestalt, Reichian body approaches, acupuncture, psychodrama, psychosynthesis, role playing, family therapy, fantasy and visualization techniques, video work, theatre games, play therapy and music therapy, all stressing encounter and communication skills. The approaches are educational only, so no therapeutic care is available. However, Haven leaders do claim to be offering both therapy and education depending on the context. *. *. There are some lectures and discussion groups, but emphasis is upon heuristic education and experiential learning, in which the person is invited to experience situations in which to learn what is needed.*.

Left: The real part (blue) and imaginary part (red) of the wavefunction. Right: The probability of finding the particle at a certain position. The top row is an energy eigenstate with low energy, the middle row is an energy eigenstate with higher energy, and the bottom is a quantum superposition mixing those two states. The bottom-right shows that the electron is moving back and forth in the superposition state. This motion causes an oscillating electric dipole moment, which in turn is proportional to the transition dipole moment between the two eigenstates. The transition dipole moment or transition moment, usually denoted \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\mathbf{d}_{nm}} for a transition between an initial state, \\\\scriptstyle{m}, and a final state, \\\\scriptstyle{n}, is the electric dipole moment associated with the transition between the two states. In general the transition dipole moment is a complex vector quantity that includes the phase factors associated with the two states. Its direction gives the polarization of the transition, which determines how the system will interact with an electromagnetic wave of a given polarization, while the square of the magnitude gives the strength of the interaction due to the distribution of charge within the system. The SI unit of the transition dipole moment is the Coulomb-meter (Cm); a more conveniently sized unit is the Debye (D).  Definition  = A single charged particle = For a transition where a single charged particle changes state from  \\\\psi_a \\\\rangle to  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle , the transition dipole moment \\\\text{(t.d.m.)} is : (\\\\text{t.d.m. } a \\\\rightarrow b) = \\\\langle \\\\psi_b  (q\\\\mathbf{r})  \\\\psi_a \\\\rangle = q\\\\int \\\\psi_b^*(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\, \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, \\\\psi_a(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\, d^3 \\\\mathbf{r} where q is the particle's charge, r is its position, and the integral is over all space (\\\\int d^3 \\\\mathbf{r} is shorthand for \\\\iiint dx \\\\, dy \\\\, dz). The transition dipole moment is a vector; for example its x-component is : (\\\\text{x-component of t.d.m. } a \\\\rightarrow b) = \\\\langle \\\\psi_b  (qx)  \\\\psi_a \\\\rangle = q\\\\int \\\\psi_b^*(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\, x \\\\, \\\\psi_a(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\, d^3 \\\\mathbf{r} In other words, the transition dipole moment can be viewed as an off-diagonal matrix element of the position operator, multiplied by the particle's charge. = Multiple charged particles = When the transition involves more than one charged particle, the transition dipole moment is defined in an analogous way to an electric dipole moment: The sum of the positions, weighted by charge. If the ith particle has charge qi and position operator ri, then the transition dipole moment is: : (\\\\text{t.d.m. } a \\\\rightarrow b) = \\\\langle \\\\psi_b  (q_1\\\\mathbf{r}_1 + q_2\\\\mathbf{r}_2 + \\\\cdots)  \\\\psi_a \\\\rangle = :: = \\\\int \\\\psi_b^*(\\\\mathbf{r}_1, \\\\mathbf{r}_2, \\\\ldots) \\\\, (q_1\\\\mathbf{r}_1 + q_2\\\\mathbf{r}_2 + \\\\cdots) \\\\, \\\\psi_a(\\\\mathbf{r}_1, \\\\mathbf{r}_2, \\\\ldots) \\\\, d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_1 \\\\, d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_2 \\\\cdots = In terms of momentum = For a single, nonrelativistic particle of mass m, in zero magnetic field, the transition dipole moment can alternatively be written in terms of the momentum operator, using the relationshiplecture notes on electric dipole radiation, especially length vs velocity :\\\\langle \\\\psi_a  \\\\mathbf{r}  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{i \\\\hbar}{(E_b - E_a)m} \\\\langle \\\\psi_a  \\\\mathbf{p}  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle This relationship can be proven starting from the commutation relation between position x and the Hamiltonian H: :[H, x] = \\\\left[\\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x,y,z), x\\\\right] = \\\\left[\\\\frac{p^2}{2m}, x\\\\right] = \\\\frac{1}{2m}(p_x[p_x,x] + [p_x,x]p_x) = -i \\\\hbar p_x/m Then :\\\\langle \\\\psi_a  (Hx - xH)  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{-i \\\\hbar}{m} \\\\langle \\\\psi_a  p_x  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle However, assuming that ψa and ψb are energy eigenstates with energy Ea and Eb, we can also write :\\\\langle \\\\psi_a  (Hx - xH)  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle = (\\\\langle \\\\psi_a  H) x  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle - \\\\langle \\\\psi_a  x ( H  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle) = (E_a - E_b) \\\\langle \\\\psi_a  x  \\\\psi_b \\\\rangle Similar relations hold for y and z, which together give the relationship above.  Analogy with a classical dipole  A basic, phenomenological understanding of the transition dipole moment can be obtained by analogy with a classical dipole. While the comparison can be very useful, care must be taken to ensure that one does not fall into the trap of assuming they are the same. In the case of two classical point charges, +q and -q, with a displacement vector, \\\\mathbf{r}, pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge, the electric dipole moment is given by :\\\\mathbf{p} = q\\\\mathbf{r}. In the presence of an electric field, such as that due to an electromagnetic wave, the two charges will experience a force in opposite directions, leading to a net torque on the dipole. The magnitude of the torque is proportional to both the magnitude of the charges and the separation between them, and varies with the relative angles of the field and the dipole: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\tau} = q\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\sin\\\\theta. Similarly, the coupling between an electromagnetic wave and an atomic transition with transition dipole moment \\\\mathbf{d}_{nm} depends on the charge distribution within the atom, the strength of the electric field, and the relative polarizations of the field and the transition. In addition, the transition dipole moment depends on the geometries and relative phases of the initial and final states.  Origin  When an atom or molecule interacts with an electromagnetic wave of frequency \\\\omega, it can undergo a transition from an initial to a final state of energy difference \\\\hbar\\\\omega through the coupling of the electromagnetic field to the transition dipole moment. When this transition is from a lower energy state to a higher energy state, this results in the absorption of a photon. A transition from a higher energy state to a lower energy state results in the emission of a photon. If the charge, e, is omitted from the electric dipole operator during this calculation, one obtains \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\alpha as used in oscillator strength.  Applications  The transition dipole moment is useful for determining if transitions are allowed under the electric dipole interaction. For example, the transition from a bonding \\\\pi orbital to an antibonding \\\\pi^* orbital is allowed because the integral defining the transition dipole moment is nonzero. Such a transition occurs between an even and an odd orbital; the dipole operator is an odd function of \\\\mathbf{r}, hence the integrand is an even function. The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits returns a value of zero, while for an even function this is not necessarily the case. This result is reflected in the parity selection rule for electric dipole transitions. The transition moment integral :\\\\int \\\\psi_1^* \\\\mu \\\\psi_2 d\\\\tau , of an electronic transition within similar atomic orbitals, such as s-s or p-p, is forbidden due to the triple integral returning an ungerade (odd) product. Such transitions only redistribute electrons within the same orbital and will return a zero product. If the triple integral returns a gerade (even) product, the transition is allowed.

Grace Livingston Hill (April 16, 1865 – February 23, 1947) was an early 20th-century novelist and wrote both under her real name and the pseudonym Marcia Macdonald. She wrote over 100 novels and numerous short stories. Her characters were most often young Christian women or become Christians within the confines of the story. Family Grace Livingston Hill was born in Wellsville, New York to Marcia Macdonald Livingston and her husband, Presbyterian minister, Rev. Charles Montgomery Livingston. Both were writers, as was her aunt, Isabella Macdonald Alden, who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Pansy.\\" Writing career Hill's writing career began as a child in the 1870s, writing short stories for her aunt's weekly children's publication, The Pansy. Her first story printed in book form was The Esselstynes, which was published in 1877 as part of the \\"Mother's Boys and Girls Library\\" by D. Lothrop & Company. A Chautauqua Idyl, her first book as a young adult, was written in 1887 to earn enough money for a family trip from her Florida home to the summer Chautauqua gathering at Chautauqua, New York. This illustrated allegory of a Chautauqua gathering held by the flowers, tree, and animals was published in time to be offered for sale that summer and brought enough earnings to take the family there. Several books written in collaboration with her family followed in the early 1890s, as well as her only children's book, A Little Servant. Lack of funds was a frequent motivator, particularly after the death of her first husband left her with two small children and no income other than that from her writing. After the death of Hill's father less than a year later, her mother came to live with her. This prompted Hill to write more frequently. During and after her failed ten-year marriage to second husband Flavius Josephus Lutz, a church organist 15 years her junior, she continued to write to support her children and mother. She stopped using the Lutz surname after they parted ways in May 1914. Although many of her earlier novels were specifically intended to proselytize, Hill's publishers frequently removed overt references to religious themes. After her publishers realized the popularity of her books, references to religious topics were allowed to remain, although she later modified her writing style to appeal to a more secular audience. The last Grace Livingston Hill book, Mary Arden, was finished by her daughter, Ruth Hill Munce, writing under the name of Ruth Livingston Hill, and published in 1948. Themes =Good and Evil= Hill's messages are simple in nature: good versus evil. As Hill believed the Bible was very clear about what was good and evil in life, she reflected that design in her own works. She wrote about a variety of different subjects, almost always with a romance worked into the message and often essential to the return to grace on the part of one or several characters. =Redemption= If her clear-cut descriptions of evil in man and woman were Hill’s primary subjects in her novels, a secondary subject would always be God’s ability to restore. Hill aimed for a happy, or at least satisfactory, ending to any situation, often focusing on characters' new or renewed faith as impetus for resolution.

On January 8, 2002, he was named the school's Director of Athletics. He took over the reins of the men's basketball program a year and a half later and became the golf head coach in 2006. Ray has now been a part of the MSU athletics family as a player, coach, or administrator for 19 of the past 23 years. Playing history Ray earned all-state accolades as a prep senior at Archer City High School, located just south of Wichita Falls. Ray helped the Wildcats win 44 consecutive district games while playing for his father, Bobby. Ray started his college basketball career at Midland Junior College and Cooke County College, but transferred to MSU in 1982 to play for NAIA Hall of Fame coach Dr. Gerald Stockton. During his senior season, Ray helped the Indians post a 25-16 mark and make an appearance in the 1984 NAIA National Tournament. Coaching history Following his senior year, Ray stayed at MSU for two more seasons to serve as a graduate assistant under women's basketball coach Kim Griffee. Ray then moved to Lon Morris College in Jacksonville, Texas, where he was an assistant coach under Vic Trilli for two seasons. Ray returned to MSU in 1988 to become Dr. Gerald Stockton's full-time assistant coach. Ray helped Stockton get the Indians program back on a winning track and make appearances in the NAIA National Tournament semifinals in 1993 and 1994. Ray took on the additional duties of coaching the women's program in the 1992–93 and 1993-94 seasons. Ray's two seasons at the Lady Indians helm were two of the program's finest ever, with his teams posting 22-8 and 28-6 records and qualifying for the NAIA national tournament both seasons. Ray also coached the Lady Indians only 1st Team NAIA All-Americans in Serena Carter (1993) and Lynn Buckmaster (1994). Following the retirement of Stockton in 1994, Ray relinquished the reins of the women's program to take over the men's team. Over the course of six years, Ray's teams posted a record of 118-60, a winning percentage of .663. Ray's teams averaged nearly 20 wins per season and made two appearances in the NAIA National Tournament and two appearances in the NCAA Division II national tournament. Ray then spent a season at the University of North Texas as an assistant coach, again under Vic Trilli, and about six months in the private sector before returning to MSU in 2002. In Ray's first season back as head coach the Indians compiled a 16-12 record and finished fourth in the Lone Star Conference South Division. Ray lead the men's basketball team to their fourth conference championship in March 2009. A little more than two weeks later, he stepped down as basketball head coach. He compiled a record of 230-121 in the 12 seasons that he was head coach.

It is a northwest-southeast diagonal route. Route description The western terminus of SR 186 is located at Virginia Avenue, west of an interchange with I-10, in Willcox. It heads east beyond I-10 along Rex Allen Drive to an intersection with the I-10 Business Loop. SR 186 heads southwest from this intersection concurrent with I-10 Bus. until it reaches Maley Street. At this intersection, SR 186 follows Maley St. to the southeast as I-10 Bus. continues to the southwest. SR 186 heads southeast from Willcox until it curves towards the east at an intersection with Kansas Settlement Road. The highway continues on this heading until it curves towards the south after passing through Dos Cabezas. The highway curves back towards the southeast until it curves back towards the south near its eastern terminus. The eastern terminus of SR 186 is located at ain intersection with SR 181 west of the Chiricahua National Monument. Aside from its endpoint in Willcox, SR 186 passes through only sparsely populated terrain, and there are no other cities or towns along the route. It serves primarily as an access road for the monument, providing a more convenient route for travelers coming from the north. History The route was added the Arizona's state highway system in 1955, when a county road was given rights to the Arizona Department of Transportation. The highway was paved from Willcox southeast for approximately four miles in 1960 before being moved a year later. The highway was then re-extended into the city of Willcox in 1968 and formally established as a state highway in 1970, when the definition of a state highway was refined in 1970. Since then, there have been no routing changes on SR 186.

Plot The film covers 24 hours in the life of three youths in Montevideo. The story is about three young boys, Leche, Javi and Seba, trying to survive until Sunday. They have a lot of problems regarding studies, girls, and their lives consist mostly of drinking or sleeping or meeting strange people like the crazy delivery boy, a retarded drug addict, and a philosophical counter clerk at a video rental store. Javi has landed a job driving a sound truck that plays the same radio spot for pasta all day long, while his buddy Leche, who is supposed to be studying for his exams, instead finds himself having sexual fantasies about his tutor, and Seba is waylaid by a handful of small-time dope dealers when all he wants to do is go home and watch the porno movie he's just rented.

It is a north- south route for its entirety. The highway is a portion of, and the southern terminus of the United States section of the CANAMEX Corridor, a trade corridor that stretches north from Mexico across the United States to the Canadian province of Alberta. Route description SR 189 is a state highway that is completely within the city limits of Nogales. The southern terminus is the Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry on the Mexico border. From the border, the highway heads north before curving towards the east to an interchange with I-19. SR 189 continues east from the interchange to its northern terminus at the I-19 Business Route. It also serves as a bypass route for truck traffic to and from Mexico, avoiding the busier border crossing at North Grand Ave in central Nogales. History The route was originally established as a state highway in 1956, from Interstate 19 in Nogales to U.S. Route 89. In 1974, the route was formally established in the city of Nogales with its current routing from the Mexican border to I-19 Business. In 1979, the section east of I-19 was given to the county, but it was given to the city of Nogales instead in 1980. In March 2018, plans were announced for improvements to the highway including additional overpasses and better access/exit ramps at the I-19 interchange to increase capacity. The project will be partly funded with $25 million from the US government, according to US Representative Martha McSally. Future The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act of 2015 formally designated I-11 throughout Arizona, which includes an upgraded SR 189 as part of the future highway's alignment. This alignment will bypass the cities of Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora and directly connects I-11 with a direct freeway connection to the United States-Mexican Border with Mexican Federal Highway 15D.

There were five model incarnations across two basic designs. In Kawasaki's chronology the 9Rs connect to the ZX900 (Ninja, which in many markets was sold as GPZ900R) as the type number corresponding to frame numbers was ZX900A, ZX900B and ZX900C. This definition is practical to note as the last version of the B-model is disguised as a C-model (caused by a change in outer design which the oncoming C-model inherited).  Introduction  Kawasaki developed the model in response to Honda's introduction of the CBR900RR Fireblade for the 1992 model year. Prior to the advent of the Fireblade, large-capacity Japanese sports motorcycles had become polarised. On one side were the 750 cc sport bikes, influenced by Endurance racing and the World Superbike Championship. On the other, the \\"big-bore\\" 1,000 cc-plus sports-tourers had become the natural evolution of the performance bikes of the preceding 20 years. In simple terms, the 750s had the handling, the big-bores had the power. In both categories, Kawasaki ruled. The ZXR750 offered the technology and the performance of ultra-expensive racing-homologation models from Honda and Yamaha at half the price, and it outclassed the similarly priced GSX-R750 of the time, which still featured a perimeter frame and an oil-cooled engine, while the ZZ-R1100 held the title of the fastest production motorcycle on Earth. The Fireblade packaged a 900 cc engine into a 750 cc sport bike chassis. It combined big- bore power with sport bike handling, but, crucially, it also pioneered meticulous attention to weight-saving design. The Fireblade not only outpowered the 750's, it was also significantly lighter. This was the detail overlooked or underappreciated by Kawasaki when they set out to build their Fireblade-beater. In building the first ZX-9R, Kawasaki combined their class- leading big-bore, the ZZR1100, with their class-leading 750, the ZXR750, rather than commit to an entirely new design. The result was a big motorcycle; despite weight-saving measures like magnesium engine covers, its quoted dry weight was , almost heavier than the Fireblade. It made around , between 10 and more than the Fireblade, but this advantage in power could not make up for its size, weight and reduced agility. Rather than be a direct competitor, the ZX-9R was retained as a more stable and more comfortable alternative to the Honda, with more straight-line speed. The road-going bias is evident through the raised clipons and more upright seating positions.  Model history  = ZX900B (1994) and ZX900B2 (1995) = ZX-9R model 1994 The first ZX-9R could be seen as a ZXR750 incorporating a number of ZZ-R1100 design features. The wheels - three-spoke cast aluminium alloy 3.5-inch x 17-inch front and 5.5-inch x 17-inch rear -, the front forks - fully adjustable 43 mm upside- down KYB - and unbraced fabricated aluminium box-section swingarm with fully adjustable remote-reservoir KYB monoshock were direct carry-overs from the ZXR. The twin-piston rear Tokico caliper no longer mounted via a torque arm, and the clip-on handlebars mounted above the top triple clamp, not below. The four-piston Tokico front calipers and 320 mm front discs were common to the ZZ-R and the ZXR. The frame was a welded aluminium-alloy dual-beam with cast steering head and swingarm endplates, but with steel-tube engine cradles and swingarm-mount endplates extending back to support the rider's seat and attach the bolt-on subframe, like the ZZ-R1100. The engine displacement was 899 cc. The crankcases, clutch and gearbox were carried over from the ZXR750, with a longer-throw crank and a bigger-bore, taller cylinder block for the larger capacity. The cylinder head was externally highly similar to the ZXR, as well, but incorporated rocker valve actuation like the ZZ-R1100 instead of the ZXR's direct actuation. Redline was 12,000 rpm against the Fireblades 10,500 rpm. Induction was by 40 mm Keihin CVKD carburettors, and the engine breathed through a 10-litre airbox fed by dual ram-air intakes on the nose of the bike, under the single headlight, via ducts passing back and over the frame beams near the steering head, like on the ZZ-R. = ZX900B3 (1996) and ZX900B4 (1997) = Detail changes. Power increased from 139 to . The rear suspension linkage and rear spring rate were replaced, improving handling. Pillion grab rails were added, the gearboxes were made stronger, and new six-piston Tokico front calipers replaced the previous model's four-piston units. The weight of the bike increased to . = ZX900C1 (1998) and ZX900C2 (1999) = Engine bore, stroke and redline remained unchanged; everything else was completely new. The clutch was changed from hydraulic to cable-operated. The generator was moved from behind the cylinder to the more conventional location at the left end of the crank. There was now no balance shaft. The valvetrain switched to direct valve actuation, and the cylinder head was plumbed for then-new plug-top ignition coils, replacing more conventional remote coils and high-tension leads. Notably, the new engine also featured a Hall-type cam position sensor on the exhaust camshaft. Cam position sensors are typically used in conjunction with electronic fuel injection. As the ZX900C featured induction by Keihin 40 mm CVKD carburettors, a cam position sensor wasn't necessary. Its inclusion could indicate that Kawasaki had designs to include fuel injection on the engine in the future. This first happened on the 2000 ZX-12R Kawasaki's first fuel-injected sport bike since the 1981–1985 GPZ1100.But this did not happen on this engine until the 2003 introduction of the Z1000, which uses a bored-out ex-ZX-9R engine. The frame lost the steel engine cradles, but also its bolt-on subframe and the rear ride height adjuster. The swingarm was a new unbraced, rectangular-section extruded design. The wheel sizes were the same, but the wheels were a new, lighter design. The brake calipers carried over, but the discs were smaller and lighter without stopping power being affected. The rear shock absorber changed from a remote-reservoir to a lighter, more compact piggyback design. The wheelbase dropped 30 mm to . New 46 mm right- way-up KYB forks replaced the heavier, though stiffer 43 mm upside down forks on the B model. The front forks were criticised by some european testers for fluttering during hard driving, a phenomenon that was only solved with the 2002 model. Overall, with a factory-quoted dry weight of , the C-model weighed less fully fuelled than the first B-model weighed dry. Visually, the new bike retained the rounded look of its predecessor, but became sleeker, with a slimmer tail unit and a smaller fairing. As a consequence of the smaller engine and shorter wheelbase, though, the fuel tank became wider and intruded more on the riding position than before. = ZX900E1 (2000) and ZX900E2 (2001) = A dramatic new look was introduced for the 2000 model, with distinctive twin headlights and a separate ram-air intake replacing the single headlight and integrated intake of the C-model. The engine gained a few horsepower from slightly shorter length CVRD 40 mm carburettors, a compression ratio increase to 12:2:1 from a lower duration intake cam, which increased cranking compression. Further improvements were aimed primarily at handling. The frame was made stiffer through the enlarging of the front engine mounting bolts, though this still left the ZX-9R with just a single front engine mount on either side of the frame. Further, the rubber bushings in the top rear engine mount were changed to alloy. This combined to make the engine's contribution to the stiffness of the frame/engine unit greater. The swingarm pivot and wheel spindles were made larger in diameter, again for more stiffness. Increased offset on the triple clamps reduced the trail on the front wheel to make the steering more agile. The forks were shortened to save weight, and the rear shock top mount was redesigned to incorporate a ride-height adjuster. = ZX900F1 (2002) and ZX900F2 (2003) = Changes to the 2002–2003 ZX-9R included a new tail fairing, a single piece front mudguard, the loss of the passenger grab handles and the B/C/E model H-bar mirror bracket. Mechanical additions included a top braced swingarm (claimed 20% stronger) and rear shock with a side facing fluid reservoir, stiffened frame with relocated solid engine mounts, increased trail and reduced fork offset, and new Nissin four-piston caliper brakes and 320 mm discs at the front wheel. Slight engine modifications included a return to the B/C model style Keihin CVKD carburettor and a 10% heavier crankshaft offset by a reduced diameter flywheel reported to help the engine spin up quicker, boosting low and mid-range torque. In 2004 the ZX-9R was replaced with the ZX-10R.

Cycle World recorded a 10.19 @ 137.90 mph from a 2002 ZX-9R F1.https://www.cycleworld.com/sport-rider/tech/sportbike-performance-numbers California-specific evaporative emissions control (EVAP) models included two- stage exhaust catalytic converters,https://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/evap/evaptp98.pdf two additional fuel tank fuel vapor recovery plumbing tubes fed to an under tank charcoal canister, an evaporative emission purge control valve incorporated into the Y-snorkel RAM air system float bowl equalization plumbing, and carburetors with electronic fuel cut off solenoids. The California EVAP model ZX-9Rs were also sold selectively throughout the U.S., including Illinois, Florida, and New York. They vented less pollution into the atmosphere, thus using what would otherwise be evaporating fuel into better fuel economy. U.K. models, which were similar to 49-state U.S. models, in that they were not fitted with California EVAP emissions plumbing valves and equipment, included the P sub- variant of ZX-9R and didn’t carry the consequential model year labeling. For instance, a 2003 U.S. model ZX-9R F2, the last ZX-9R produced by Kawasaki, could be labeled by an owner in the U.K. as a 2004, 2005, 2006, etc, etc, etc,...

Bender is a German financial journalist and author, best known for writing the book Moneymakers: The Secret World of Banknote Printing. Early life He was born in 1938 in Darmstadt, county of Hesse. Bender studied economics at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and, later, at University of Cologne, financing his entire studies by working as a factory hand and office clerk. After graduation in 1964, with an MA in business administration, he immediately joined the research institute of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FESt), one of the largest German political foundations, which in 1966 dispatched him to its newly opened regional office in Tokyo, Japan. Career =Germany= In 1970, Bender left FESt in order to become a journalist, a move he had planned for a long time. Initially, he reported from Tokyo on Japanese economic affairs as a freelance journalist for about 20 German and Swiss newspapers but soon was hired by Der Spiegel, Germany's most prominent weekly magazine, and simultaneously by Handelsblatt, one of Germany's leading economic dailies, as a freelance (economic) writer with a fixed retainer fee. In 1972, upon invitation from the board of publishers, Bender joined Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), Germany's leading daily (conservative) paper. He now reported on an exclusive basis for FAZ on politics, economics, and culture in the Asian region. Assignments by FAZ sent him to all countries of East and Southeast Asia, with the exception of war-torn Indochina. Highlights were trips to mainland China (repeatedly), to North Korea, and to the Soviet Far East. All at that time were regions still closed to visitors from the West. =Italy= After 14 years in Japan, Bender in 1980 asked for a transfer back to Europe. He was reassigned as economics correspondent of FAZ in Rome, covering Italy and selected countries around the Mediterranean Basin. Although Bender considered the years passed in Italy as particularly happy and enriching, the fall of the Wall in Berlin induced him to ask in 1992, for a transfer to Eastern Europe. As economics correspondent of FAZ for Eastern and Southeastern Europe, he now accompanied the countries in the Prague-Bucharest- Belgrade triangle on their painful road of transition from Soviet oppression to a free market system and parliamentary democracy. =Misprint of euro= In the year 2000 Bender asked to be relieved of his duties as a full-time reporter in order to have more time for writing a non-fiction book about the arcane international high security printing industry that prints our banknotes, passports, and credit cards. However, he remained affiliated with FAZ as a reporter for specialized topics. In view of the upcoming common European currency, Bender as early as 1996 had started collecting material for a book on this subject even though frequent travelling for his newspaper made this additional task very difficult. As one result of this research, Bender in 2000, broke in FAZ the story of the misprint of more than 300 million pieces of 100-euro banknotes by Germany's high security printer Giesecke & Devrient. Bender's story went around the world, forcing the Munich-based company to recall the affected banknotes from the European Central Bank, and adding the missing security feature at an estimated additional cost of 15 million euro. Later it was Bender, who with several pieces published by FAZ, for the first time publicly denounced the shocking events surrounding the privatization of Bundesdruckerei, Berlin. This highly reputed German state banknote printer, because of the greed and incompetence of the people involved in the privatization process, was brought to the brink of collapse. It was one of the biggest economic scandals in post-war Germany. Published book In 2004, Bender published the result of many years of research in German language in his book Geldmacher, das geheimste Gewerbe der Welt, published by Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (Germany). This first book published worldwide on the extremely secretive high security printing industry was applauded even by the sensitive industry itself, and was on the list of bestsellers (economics) in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In 2006, Bender published an up-dated version in English titled Moneymakers: The Secret World of Banknote Printing, again with Wiley-VCH. In this English version, based on technical facts, Bender, for the first time presented the massive doubts harboured by the high security printing industry and European police forces concerning the American accusations that North Korea is counterfeiting US 50- and 100-dollar bills on a large scale. These counterfeits called \\"supernotes\\" are of such high quality that even seasoned experts of banknote printing cannot distinguish them from a genuine note. More detailed information on this extremely touchy issue, obtained by Bender after the English version had gone to print, was published in two separate articles in FAZ (February 2006, January 2007), and in the Swiss paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung (February 2007). In these articles Bender also alleges that \\"supernotes\\" are actually produced by CIA in a facility near Washington D.C.Stammen die „Supernotes“ von der CIA?, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, February 2007.

Tooth brushing is the act of scrubbing teeth with a toothbrush, usually equipped with toothpaste. Interdental cleaning (with floss or an interdental brush) can be useful with tooth brushing, and together these two activities are the primary means of cleaning teeth, one of the main aspects of oral hygiene. Brushing teeth properly helps prevent cavities, and periodontal, or gum disease, which causes at least one-third of adult tooth loss. If teeth are not brushed correctly and frequently, it could lead to the calcification of saliva minerals, forming tartar. Tartar hardens (then referred to as 'calculus') if not removed every 24 hours. Poor dental health has been associated with heart disease and shortened life expectancy.Systemic Diseases Caused by Oral Infection Clinical Microbiology Reviews, October 2000, p. 547-558, Vol. 13, No. 4 Osteoporosis and Periodontal Disease Division of Periodontology, Department of Dentistry, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, School of Dentistry, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.Periodontal infections and cardiovascular disease JADA, Vol. 137. October 2006  History  A photo from 1899 showing the use of a toothbrush. As long ago as 3000 B.C., the ancient Egyptians constructed crude toothbrushes from twigs and leaves to clean their teeth. Similarly, other cultures such as the Greeks, Romans, Arabs and Indians cleaned their teeth with twigs. Some would fray one end of the twig so that it could penetrate between the teeth more effectively. Modern day toothbrushing as a regular habit became prevalent in Europe from the end of the 17th century. The first mass-produced toothbrush was developed in England in 1780. In the United States, although toothbrushes were available at the end of the 19th century, the practice did not become widespread until after the Second World War, when US soldiers continued the toothbrushing that had been required during their military service.. The modern toothbrush was developed in England in 1780. While languishing in jail, William Addis decided to drill holes into a sheep's tibia, and pulled through the bristles of boar hair.  Toothbrushing guidelines  = Frequency = Although there is a consensus that a thorough toothbrushing once a day is sufficient for maintaining oral health, most dentists recommend patients brush twice a day since a sufficient level of thoroughness in brushing is not normally achieved. = Proper technique = The front and backs of teeth should be brushed with the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle towards the gum line, moving the brush in a back and forth rolling motion that makes contact with the gum line and tooth. To brush the backs of the front teeth the brush should be held vertically to the tooth and moved in an up and down motion. The chewing surfaces of the teeth are brushed with a forward and back motion, with the toothbrush pointing straight at the tooth. = Toothbrushing before breakfast/dinner= One study found that brushing immediately after an acidic meal (such as diet soda and common breakfast foods like orange juice, citrus fruit, dried fruit, bread, pastrieshttps://www.healthline.com/health/should-you-brush-your-teeth-before- or-after-breakfast#how-to-brush) caused more damage to enamel and the dentin, compared to waiting 30 minutes. Flushing the acid away with water or dissolved baking soda could help reduce acid damage exacerbated by brushing. The same response was recommended for acid re-flux and other acidic meals. Researchers and dentists have concluded that brushing immediately after consuming acidic beverages should be avoided. Better to brush before breakfast or dinner.https://www.rdhmag.com/patient-care/rinses- pastes/article/16403965/brush-before-eating If brushing after a meal, wait at least a half hour after eating to prevent damage to your teeth.https://www.deltadental.com/grinmag/us/en/ddpa/2019/fall/lifestyle/brush- before-breakfast.html > When you’re looking to protect your tooth enamel, brushing right after you > wake up in the morning is better than brushing your teeth after breakfast. > If you have to brush your teeth after breakfast, try to wait between 30 and > 60 minutes before you brush.

Toothpaste, often containing fluoride, is commonly added to a toothbrush to aid in cleaning. Toothbrushes come in manual and electric varieties. Although there is conflicting evidence as to which is more effective, most evidence points to electric toothbrushes with an oscillatory motion being more effective than manual toothbrushes, with toothbrushes lacking an oscillatory motion being equivalent. A 2014 Cochrane review found moderate evidence that electric toothbrushing reduce plaque and gingivitis more than the manual one. Overall, both manual and electric toothbrushes are effective, however, and it is often recommended that people use whichever one they feel comfortable with, determine what is affordable for them and will be more likely to regularly brush with. Toothbrushes are offered with varying textures of bristles, and come in many different forms and sizes. Most dentists recommend using a toothbrush labelled \\"soft\\", since firmer bristled toothbrushes can damage tooth enamel and irritate gums as indicated by the American Dental Association. Toothbrushes are often made from synthetic fibers, although natural toothbrushes are also known in many parts of the world. Those with dentures may also brush their teeth with traditional tooth brushes, specially made denture brushes or denture cleaners.  Toothpaste  Modern toothpaste gel Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used to clean and improve the aesthetic appearance and health of teeth. It is almost always used in conjunction with a toothbrush. Toothpaste use can promote good oral hygiene: it can aid in the removal of dental plaque and food from the teeth, it can aid in the elimination and/or masking of halitosis when tonsil stones are not the cause, and it can deliver active ingredients such as fluoride to prevent tooth and gum (gingiva) disease. There is evidence that the addition of xylitol to fluoride-containing toothpastes reduces incidence of tooth decay by about 13%. Tooth powder (or 'toothpaste powder') is an alternative to toothpaste. It may be recommended for people with sensitive teeth. Tooth powder typically does not contain the chemical sodium lauryl sulphate which can be a skin irritant. The function of sodium lauryl sulphate is to form suds when teeth are brushed. It is a common chemical in toothpaste. Those with dentures may also use denture cleaner which can also come in powder format.

They were the first magnetic tape recorders to be manufactured in Britain, and their design imitated that of the tape recorders used by the Germans during the war. Because these multi-track recorders were painted EMI green, they then became known as the \\"Green Machines\\". The first model made was named the BTR1. The BTR1 machines were first created in 1947, but superseded by the BTR2 mono machine in 1952 (with bias current, giving them better fidelity). The BTR2 was made in greater quantity, being used not only at EMI studios but at the BBC. Many studios later purchased ex-BBC units, so quite a few were found in non- EMI London studios. The BTR3 recorder was initially intended to support 2 or 4 tracks, but the only machines produced were the stereo (2-track) machines, the 4-track version having been rejected at the prototype stage. Only a few of these BTR3s were built, and the only known use of them is at the Abbey Road Studios during the 1960s, where they were used for all stereo recording and disc mastering. A BTR3 tape recorder, previously used at Abbey Road, was found by former Radio Glen Technical Manager Henry Walmsley, and members of Surge Radio, the student-run radio station of the University of Southampton, at one of the University's Halls of Residence (Glen Eyre Halls) in February 2017. It had been in use at the station—where it was known as 'The Beatle'—until around 2001. The TR90 was a smaller, more portable stereo unit, and was used professionally on EMI Remote recordings, as well as at Hayes, EMI's manufacturing complex. The Otari company made a BTR-5 model recording machine, the initials standing for Broadcast Tape Recorder.

They are used during the celebrations of St. John the Baptist and the Midsummer. It is a specialized form of the Cumaco drum. Its origins have been traced to the Mina civilization, which occupied what is now Benin in Africa. Organology The drum is made out of the trunk of the guava tree (or other hardwood) that has been naturally hollowed out by termites. It can measure up to 2m (6 ft) in length, with a diameter varying (because it fluctuates with the available material) between 20 and 40 cm (about 10-14 inches). One end is capped with a head made of cow or deer hide held in place with a peg and rope assembly. The other end is open. Playing style The mina is placed on a fork to elevate the drum head to the soloist's chest level. The soloist holds a pair of sticks to beat the main pattern and improvisations on the drum head. A group of accompanists stand and squat alongside and beat an ostinato pattern with sticks on the shell. A smaller drum, named curbata plays the basic pattern with little or no deviation. Unlike the pattern of the redondo drum, which is divided in multiples of 3 beats per measure, the pattern of the Mina battery is based on multiples of 2 beats per measure. Cultural significance The mina battery is an integral part of the summer celebrations in Afro-Venezuelan communities of North-Central Venezuela (the region called Barlovento). The celebrations of the Summer Solstice coincides with the day of San Juan Bautista (St. John the Baptist), which may account for the Saint's popularity in Barlovento. The mina (also called Tambor Grande or large drum) is set up on a fixed location, where people converge to hear and dance to the performance. In contrast, the smaller, lighter redondo battery (called Tambor Pequeño or small drum) is carried around by the musicians and played at different points of the procession dedicated to St. John. Cumaco or Mina? The Mina is a specialized form of the cumaco drum. The main differences between the two terms are: * Cumacos are widespread in many Afro-Venezuelan communities. The Mina is unique to Barlovento. * Cumacos have the head nailed or tacked on the drum shell. Minas use a rope/wedge assembly (a method still used in Africa in the Ewe, Adowa and the Igba drum families). * Cumaco ensembles may include more than one large drum. Mina ensembles only have one large drum and a smaller one, the aforementioned curbata. * Cumacos are often laid on the ground and played by sitting astride (soloist) and squatting alongside. Minas are held on a diagonal with a wooden fork, so the soloist may stand in front of the drum head. Bibliography *Max H.

It is currently managed by YMCA St Paul’s Group.  Description  The pool, which has two slides, is 36 x 14 metres. There is also a small pool (12 x 7 metres) for children. Other facilities include a gym, fitness-studio and cafeteria. The James Taylor Quartet performing at Hampton Pool It is operated by the Hampton Pool Trust, a registered charity (number 294117) and not for profit company (number 01870925). It is managed by YMCA St Paul's Group on behalf of the Trust. The Trust's fund-raising activities also include summer open-air concerts.  History  The lido was built in 1922 after plans approved in 1914 were delayed due to the outbreak of the First World War. In 1939 a diving pit and filtration system was added and in 1961 further improvements included widening the pool, and adding a new building and a car park. By 1980 Richmond Council decided to close the lido for financial reasons. After local community campaigning, in which over £60,000 was raised, the pool was reopened in 1985. The management of the pool was transferred to Hampton Pool Ltd, a company created by the campaign group.For a detailed history of this lido, see Page 162, and Notes and references  External links  * *Lidos in the UK Category:1922 establishments in England Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Hampton, London Category:Lidos Category:Swimming venues in London Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:YMCA ","title":"Hampton Pool"},{"id":"9812922","text":"Cliff shaped by glacial movement surrounding the Mohonk Lake at Mohonk Mountain House on Shawangunk Ridge Hand sample of the Shawangunk conglomerate from Blue Mountain, near New Tripoli, Pennsylvania The Silurian Shawangunk Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It is named for the Shawangunk Ridge for which it is the dominant rock type. The division of the Shawangunk between the Tuscarora Formation and Clinton Group has not been conclusively determined. The shift of nomenclature currently has the divide between Hawk Mountain and Lehigh Gap. Description The Shawangunk is defined as a light to dark-gray, fine to very coarse grained sandstone and conglomerate, containing a few shale interbeds.Berg, T.M., Edmunds, W.E., Geyer, A.R. and others, compilers, (1980). Geologic Map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Map 1, scale 1:250,000. There are also four members of this formation: Tammany, Lizard Creek, Minsi, and Weiders. The Lizard Creek member is described at Lehigh Gap as having conglomerates, sandstone, calcareous sandstone, siltstone, and shale with a few minor red beds. The Minsi Member is described as a conglomeritic quartzite and the Weiders is described as both a conglomerate and quartzite.Epstein, J.B., Sevon, W.D., Glaeser, J.D. (1974). Geology and the Mineral Resources of the Lehighton and Palmerton Quardrangles, Carbon and Northampton Counties, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, PA. A195c&d.; The Tammany and Lizard Creek members are equivalent to the Clinton Formation and the Minsi and Weiders members are equivalent to the Tuscarora Formation in the central and western part of Pennsylvania. The Tammany Member was not described at Lehigh Gap. =Depositional environment= The depositional environment of the Shawangunk has always been interpreted as mostly terrestrial to a shallow marine deposit resulting in a molasse sequence produced by the Taconic orogeny. The numerous coarse-grained beds, especially in the lower part, suggest a relatively close orogenic source with very high to high energy fluvial systems depositing the sediments. Shale interbeds may indicate a slowing or shifting of these ancient river systems. =Fossils= Very few fossils exist in the Shawangunk; however, Eurypterids can be found in the middle portions of the formation roughly 420–750 feet from the base in some locations in New York State.Epstein, J.B., (1993) Stratigraphy of Silurian Rocks in Shawangunk Mountain, Southeastern New York, Including a Historical Review of Nomenclature. United States Geological Survey Publication L14. Linguloid brachiopods were identified in the Lizard Creek Member. The ichnofossil Arthrophycus was described in the Minsi Member in the area of Lehigh Gap. These were most likely made by polychaete worms of the family Terebellida. =Notable Exposures= Shawangunk Formation (rock in foreground) at High Point State Park, New Jersey, facing northeast. * Delaware Water Gap * Lehigh Gap, Pennsylvania * High Point State Park, New Jersey Age Relative age dating of the Shawangunk places it in the Lower Silurian period, being deposited between 440 and 417 (±10) million years ago. It rests unconformably above the Martinsburg Formation and conformably below the Bloomsburg Formation.Berg, T.M., et al., (1983). Stratagraphic Correlation Chart of Pennsylvania: G75, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Economic uses The hardness of the quartzite and conglomerate layers make the Shawangunk an excellent building stone. Some of the boulders that have accumulated as colluvium at the base of Blue Mountain are used for decorative stone, building stone, and aggregate.

On March 21, 2003, he was in charge of 11 Marines in a supply unit when he stepped on a land mine and lost his right leg. Alva, a native of San Antonio, Texas, grew up in a military family. He graduated from high school in 1989, weighing just 90 pounds. He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1990 at the age of 19 when he already knew he was gay and the U.S. military excluded all gays and lesbians from service, open or not. He served for 13 years, including postings in Okinawa and Somalia. For much of his career, he was out to his fellow Marines.Congress, House, Military Personnel Subcommittee, Don't Ask Don't Tell Review, 110th Cong., 2nd sess., July 23, 2008, 7-9, 15, 17, 22, 27, 44 He began working as a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign in 2006. In February 2007, he joined Democratic Rep. Marty Meehan of Massachusetts and a bipartisan group of House members when they reintroduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, legislation that would repeal the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT) policy regarding service in the U.S. armed forces on the part of gays and lesbians. Alva then served as the Grand Marshal of the 2008 Chicago Gay and Lesbian Pride parade on Sunday, June 29, 2008. On July 23, 2008, Alva testified about DADT before a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. He said: \\"Unit cohesion is essential. What my experience proves, they are wrong about how to achieve it. My being gay and even many of my colleagues knowing about it didn’t damage unit cohesion. They put their lives in my hands, and when I was injured, they risked their lives to save mine.\\" He described intimate living conditions while stationed in Somalia. He also reported conversations with military personnel from other countries in which they uniformly expressed surprise that \\"our Nation is so further behind others when we seem to be the forefront of trying to be the example.\\" In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, General Peter Pace said, \\"I believe homosexual acts between individuals are immoral.\\" Alva commented: \\"His remarks were insensitive and disrespectful to the thousands of men and women who are serving in the military at this current time under the policy.\\" In December 2010, Marine Corps commandant Gen. James F. Amos said the presence of homosexuals in the marines would pose a \\"distraction\\" and that \\"I don't want to have any Marines that I'm visiting at Bethesda [National Naval Medical Center] with no legs be the result of any type of distraction.\\" Alva commented: \\"He pretty much spit on me, my Purple Heart, and my 13 years of service. I would definitely ask Amos for a meeting to explain his comments, and I’d bring my Purple Heart with me.\\" Quotes *\\"I come from a family of servicemen. My dad, Fidelis, is a Vietnam vet.

Eventually the expiration of an interval timer, or the receipt of a signal or interrupt causes the program to resume execution.  Usage  A typical sleep system call takes a time value as a parameter, specifying the minimum amount of time that the process is to sleep before resuming execution. The parameter typically specifies seconds, although some operating systems provide finer resolution, such as milliseconds or microseconds. = Windows = On Windows, the \`Sleep()\` function takes a single parameter of the number of milliseconds to sleep. The \`Sleep()\` function is included in kernel32.dll. MSDN Library Reference - Sleep() The function has a resolution no higher than the current timer resolution, typically 16ms but at minimum 1ms, adjustable via the family of \\"media timer\\" APIs. For higher precisions, it is necessary to use a busy loop over , such as the one used in gnulib. = Unix = On Unix-like and other POSIX operating systems, the \`sleep()\` function is called providing a single parameter of type unsigned integer of the number of seconds to sleep. A higher-precision version is the function and the now deprecated . POSIX also allows for choosing clock sources via the extended version . A version of was proposed to be part of the C programming language, but was rejected. The UTC time part of the same proposal was added to C11. = C examples = In Windows API: Sleep(2 * 1000); // Sleep for 2 seconds In Unix or POSIX system calls: sleep(2); // Sleep for 2 seconds  Low level functionality  Sleep causes the thread or process to give up the remainder of its time slice and stay in the Not Runnable state for the specified duration. While there is generally a guarantee for the minimum time period, there is no strict guarantee that the thread will run immediately or soon, or even at all, once the specified time has passed. It is up to the scheduler's discretion, and dependent on thread priorities and implementation details such as timer resolutions when the sleeping thread will run again. On POSIX systems, the nanosleep and related syscalls are interruptible by signals, returning the remaining sleep time. The sleep library function, on the other hand, is implemented via the alarm syscall on many older systems, thus it only works by delivering a signal. The Windows Sleep function is non-interruptible due to absence of signals (other than the thread or its process being terminated), although the related SleepEx function can be used to put the thread into an alertable state, allowing APC calls being made while the thread is sleeping. Also, a thread can technically be \\"interrupted\\" in case e.g. the process terminates due to an exception in a different thread.  Uses  Some system programs that never terminate execute an event loop, going to sleep at the start of each cycle and waiting for some event to awaken them. Once an event is received, the program services the event, then returns to the beginning of the next wait cycle. Other programs periodically poll for events by going to sleep and resuming execution after a specific interval of time. Once execution is resumed, the program polls for events or status changes, and then services any that occurred while it was asleep. After servicing the events, the program then goes to sleep again for the next time interval. Certain kinds of heartbeat events or keep-alive signals can be generated by these kinds of programs. The \`sleep()\` function call can be repeatedly called for short periods of time to slow the execution of a running program or code. Throttling code in this manner provides a coarse mechanism for mitigating the effects of overheating hardware or easing timing issues for legacy programs. The downside to cycling sleep and running states rather than leveraging cycle emulation (via an emulator) to control the execution speed of software is that interactive software will acquire a notable stutter if too little time is spent awake, too much time is spent sleeping, or a combination of both. = Uninterruptible sleep = An uninterruptible sleep state is a sleep state that won't handle a signal right away. It will wake only as a result of a waited-upon resource becoming available or after a time-out occurs during that wait (if specified when put to sleep). It is mostly used by device drivers waiting for disk or network IO (input/output). When the process is sleeping uninterruptibly, signals accumulated during the sleep will be noticed when the process returns from the system call or trap. In Unix-like systems the command '\`ps -l\`' uses code \\"\`D\`\\" for the uninterruptible sleep state of a process. Such processes cannot be killed even with \`SIGKILL\` and the only non-sophisticated way to get rid of them is to reboot the system.

The National Religious community falls under the jurisdiction of Gush Etzion Regional Council. Under the terms of the Oslo Accords of 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, Karmei Tzur was designated Area \\"C\\" under full Israeli civil and security control. In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. According to a Peace Now-report of 2006, 27 percent of the land Karmei Tzur is built on, is privately owned, all or most of it by Palestinians.In the data provided by the Civil Administration “there is no mention of whether the private land is owned by Palestinians or by Jews... Nevertheless, it is highly probable that most of the land that is marked here as private land (if not all of it) is owned Palestinian land”. According to Israeli law, settlements on privately owned Palestinian land are illegal. History Karmei Tzur, meaning “Vineyards (or Olive Groves) of Rock” or “Stalwart Vineyards”,The word “kerem”, possessive “karmei”, is used in Hebrew to denote both olive groves and vineyards. was established in 1984 by a group of students from the Har Etzion Yeshiva in Alon Shvut, and was named after the nearby Hasmonean and Biblical place of Beth-ZurCarta's Official Guide to Israel and Complete Gazetteer to all Sites in the Holy Land. (3rd edition 1993) Jerusalem, Carta, p.257, (English) Geography Karmei Tzur is situated east of the Israeli West Bank barrier, 8.3 kilometers from the Green line in the Judean hills north of Hebron, 22 kilometers from Jerusalem. The settlement has a total area of about 420.000 square meters. Population There are about 120 families living in the settlement with more than 700 people in total. This includes 13 families living in the adjacent Tzur Shalem outpost and eight immigrant families of Inca Jews from Trujillo, Peru, who have been housed there as part of an absorption program. The settlement is home to Yeshiva students, educators, academics, army officers, traders, and doctors. Most of the residents work in Gush Etzion, Kiryat Arba, or Jerusalem. Education Local children are educated within the settlement until they reach school age. School children are transported to schools in the centre of Gush Etzion. There is a wide variety of after school activities provided in the settlement. Outposts Karmei Tzur has an outpost, Tzur Shalem, which is also considered illegal under Israeli law. It was established in 2001 in memory of Dr. Shmuel Gillis, a senior physician at the Hadassah Medical Center and resident of Karmei Tzur of English origins who was killed after Palestinians shot him while driving home on 1 February 2001 during the Second Intifada. The name was chosen by Gillis′ widow. “Shalem”, meaning “whole”, shares some of the letters of Gillis′ first name “Shmuel”, and the word “tzur”, meaning “rock”, is one of the names for God and also symbolizes strength and steadfastness. The outpost with more than twenty caravans and 13 families is located to the west of Karmei Tzur and has views of the Shephelah Region. Israeli-Palestinian conflict In February 2001, Dr. Shmuel Gillis (42) of Karmei Tzur was shot eleven times by Palestinian gunmen while driving. He died instantly.Dr. Shmuel Gillis In June 2002 Hamas terrorists, possibly assisted by Islamic Jihad men, infiltrated the Tzur Shalem outpost and killed Ayal Sorek (23) and his 9-month-pregnant wife Yael (24) along with reserve soldier Shalom Mordechai (35) from Nahariya. As B'Tselem reports, in October 2011, settlers from Karmei Tzur threw stones at Palestinians demonstrating against what they claimed was the seizure of their primarily privately owned land forming the special security area (SSA) surrounding the settlement, which settlers can enter freely, while the Palestinian landowners must obtain special permits to enter. A Palestinian photographer who was filming the events was injured, while apparently security officials from the settlement and Israeli soldiers did not intervene. In February 2012, Karmei Tzur resident Zehava Weiss, a teacher, was attacked with stones and bricks near the Palestinian town Beit Ummar while driving to Karmei Tzur. Although her car was armored, the windshield was shattered and the exterior was dented in several places. According to her, similar attacks are a near daily occurrence. Following the incident, two suspects were arrested near the Palestinian town of Al-Khader. The settlement is home to Reuven Bel-Uliel, the father of the alleged attacker in the Duma arson attack, and the rabbi of Karmei Tzur. The Ben-Uliel family released a statement supporting their son and protesting his innocence.Elisha Ben Kimon, 'Amiram Ben-Uliel: The handyman accused of Duma murders,' Ynet 3 January 2016.

It is a symplectic integrator and hence it yields better results than the standard Euler method.  Setting  The semi-implicit Euler method can be applied to a pair of differential equations of the form : {dx \\\\over dt} = f(t,v) : {dv \\\\over dt} = g(t,x), where f and g are given functions. Here, x and v may be either scalars or vectors. The equations of motion in Hamiltonian mechanics take this form if the Hamiltonian is of the form : H = T(t,v) + V(t,x). \\\\, The differential equations are to be solved with the initial condition : x(t_0) = x_0, \\\\qquad v(t_0) = v_0.  The method  The semi-implicit Euler method produces an approximate discrete solution by iterating :\\\\begin{align} v_{n+1} &= v_n + g(t_n, x_n) \\\\, \\\\Delta t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0.3em] x_{n+1} &= x_n + f(t_n, v_{n+1}) \\\\, \\\\Delta t \\\\end{align} where Δt is the time step and tn = t0 \\\\+ nΔt is the time after n steps. The difference with the standard Euler method is that the semi-implicit Euler method uses vn+1 in the equation for xn+1, while the Euler method uses vn. Applying the method with negative time step to the computation of (x_n,v_n) from (x_{n+1},v_{n+1}) and rearranging leads to the second variant of the semi-implicit Euler method :\\\\begin{align} x_{n+1} &= x_n + f(t_n, v_n) \\\\, \\\\Delta t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0.3em] v_{n+1} &= v_n + g(t_n, x_{n+1}) \\\\, \\\\Delta t \\\\end{align} which has similar properties. The semi-implicit Euler is a first-order integrator, just as the standard Euler method. This means that it commits a global error of the order of Δt. However, the semi-implicit Euler method is a symplectic integrator, unlike the standard method. As a consequence, the semi-implicit Euler method almost conserves the energy (when the Hamiltonian is time-independent). Often, the energy increases steadily when the standard Euler method is applied, making it far less accurate. Alternating between the two variants of the semi-implicit Euler method leads in one simplification to the Störmer-Verlet integration and in a slightly different simplification to the leapfrog integration, increasing both the order of the error and the order of preservation of energy. The stability region of the semi-implicit method was presented by NiiranenNiiranen, Jouko: Fast and accurate symmetric Euler algorithm for electromechanical simulations Proceedings of the Electrimacs'99, Sept. 14-16, 1999 Lisboa, Portugal, Vol. 1, pages 71 - 78. although the semi-implicit Euler was misleadingly called symmetric Euler in his paper. The semi-implicit method models the simulated system correctly if the complex roots of the characteristic equation are within the circle shown below. For real roots the stability region extends outside the circle for which the criteria is s > - 2/\\\\Delta t Image:Symplectic Euler stability region.jpeg As can be seen, the semi-implicit method can simulate correctly both stable systems that have their roots in the left half plane and unstable systems that have their roots in the right half plane. This is clear advantage over forward (standard) Euler and backward Euler. Forward Euler tends to have less damping than the real system when the negative real parts of the roots get near the imaginary axis and backward Euler may show the system be stable even when the roots are in the right half plane.  Example  The motion of a spring satisfying Hooke's law is given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dx}{dt} &= v(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0.2em] \\\\frac{dv}{dt} &= -\\\\frac{k}{m}\\\\,x=-\\\\omega^2\\\\,x. \\\\end{align} The semi-implicit Euler for this equation is :\\\\begin{align} v_{n+1} &= v_n - \\\\omega^2\\\\,x_n\\\\,\\\\Delta t \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0.2em] x_{n+1} &= x_n + v_{n+1} \\\\,\\\\Delta t. \\\\end{align} Substituting v_{n+1} in the second equation with the expression given by the first equation, the iteration can be expressed in the following matrix form :\\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{n+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\v_{n+1}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1-\\\\omega^2 \\\\Delta t^2 & \\\\Delta t \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\omega^2 \\\\Delta t & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_{n} \\\\end{bmatrix}, and since the determinant of the matrix is 1 the transformation is area-preserving. The iteration preserves the modified energy functional E_h(x,v)=\\\\tfrac12\\\\left(v^2+\\\\omega^2\\\\,x^2-\\\\omega^2\\\\Delta t\\\\,vx\\\\right) exactly, leading to stable periodic orbits (for sufficiently small step size) that deviate by O(\\\\Delta t) from the exact orbits. The exact circular frequency \\\\omega increases in the numerical approximation by a factor of 1+\\\\tfrac1{24}\\\\omega^2\\\\Delta t^2+O(\\\\Delta t^4).

Nobel laureate James Tobin said about him: \\"For the economics profession throughout the world, the third quarter of this century was an Age of Johnson. ... It was his impact on his own profession ... that justifies calling the era his Age.\\" Appointed professor of economics at Manchester University in 1956, he left upon being appointed Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago from 1959 (and from 1969, the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor) until his death in 1977. He was also Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics from 1966 until 1974. And he briefly was professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva until his death. He was twice Editor of the Journal of Political Economy. He had a stroke at age 49 and died prematurely from a second stroke at age 53. In 1976 the Canadian government named him an officer of the Order of Canada and in 1977 he was named a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association. The Canadian Economics Association awards an annual Harry G. Johnson Prize for the best paper published in the Canadian Journal of Economics. Early life and education He was born on 26 May 1923 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the elder son of two children of Henry Herbert Johnson, newspaperman and later secretary of the Liberal Party of Ontario, and his wife, Frances Lily Muat, lecturer in child psychology at the Institute of Child Study of the University of Toronto. Johnson was educated at the University of Toronto schools and then obtained scholarships to the University of Toronto, where he studied law and economics. According to W. Max Corden in the Oxford Dictionary of Biography, it was at this time that he \\"developed an interest in the history of thought and was much influenced by Harold Innis's lectures and ideas on Canadian and generalized economic history.\\"Corden, W. Max, \\"Johnson, Harry Gordon (1923–1977)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, 23 September 2004. Retrieved 8 April 2018 He graduated in 1943 and subsequently became, for one year, acting professor and sole member of the economics staff at St Francis Xavier University, in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. \\"In 1944\\", explains Corden, \\"Johnson volunteered for active service in the Canadian armed forces and, after training, was sent to England in 1945, eventually doing clerical work in Canada House.\\" This was then followed by further study at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first-class BA degree in economics under the tutelage of the Marxist economist Maurice Dobb; a return to the University of Toronto, where he earned his MA degree; and then finally doctoral research at Harvard University, where he completed the course work requirements in three terms. It was while at Harvard that he became a follower of the ideas of Joseph Schumpeter. In 1948 he married Elizabeth Scott, daughter of Harold Victor Serson, civil engineer. She later became one of the editors of the collected writings of Keynes. They had one son and one daughter. Career Harry, as Johnson was universally known, was an inveterate conference-goer. In addition he visited innumerable universities, especially in Canada and in Asia. He \\"circled the globe like a planet\\" (Scott 80). This travelling style began in the fifties when he was teaching refresher courses for economists in Karachi and Singapore. His travelling and ubiquitousness became legendary. Physically, he was a large man, overweight or at least stout, with piercing dark brown eyes. But he was far from sluggish, and gave an impression of intense and disciplined intellectual and physical energy. He was often loudly and informally dressed. His energy was kept under control by his continuous carving of wooden statuettes, of which he made thousands in many different artistic styles. He carved at seminars and in his room, throughout the most concentrated discussions of intricate economic problems. Economist Jagdish Bhagwati, writing about Johnson's productivity and accessibility, said, \\"Countless numbers of manuscripts would reach him, from aspiring students of international economics and somehow Harry found the energy and time to read them carefully and write back to the authors promptly. ... once ... when he was staying with us, my wife asked him what he had been doing in the early hours of the morning when we had been still asleep. 'I read two manuscripts, one indifferent and the other bad; what is worse, I could have written one good paper in that time.' \\" He was a strong drinker and his reputation at London School of Economics and Political Science was that he travelled weekly between London and Chicago, and he would enter each flight with a bottle of Southern Comfort and would leave it with a fully written paper! According to Moggeridge he was often deeply intoxicated whilst attending seminars and workshops. Despite his prolific writing, he was criticized for essentially rewriting the same articles over and over. George Stigler was asked about Johnson's 500 published papers versus his 100. Stigler replied, \\"Yes, but mine were all different.\\" The enormous admiration and affection for Johnson was reflected in the numerous obituaries by members of the economics profession that appeared in 1977. \\"For the economics profession throughout the world, the third quarter of this century was an Age of Johnson\\" (Tobin 443). \\"He bestrode our discipline like a Colossus\\", \\"He was an institution\\" (ibid.). \\"Canada lost one of its greatest sons\\". He was \\"larger than life’ (the most common remark). \\"The one and only Harry\\" (The Economist, 14 May 1977, 121). Harry Johnson died of a stroke in Geneva on 9 May 1977; he was survived by his wife. Legacy Johnson made many contributions to the development of Hecksher-Ohlin theory and until the 1970s according to Moggeridge, was the second most quoted trade theorist after Paul Samuelson. Johnson also helped to found the monetary approach to the balance of payments and wrote many high quality surveys of monetary economics that helped to clarify the issues in question. Despite being perhaps the most prolific economist of the modern era, Johnson's star has waned as is evidenced by the significant fall (discussed in Moggeridge's biography) in citations to his work in the past decade. The Canadian Economics Association presents a Harry Johnson Prize every year for the best article to appear in the Canadian Journal of Economics in the preceding year. Career =Academics= He held permanent teaching positions throughout Europe and Canada, as well as visiting positions at universities worldwide. Notable were his time with Chicago from 1959 to 1977, also during 1966–74 he worked at the London School of Economics. He also held a visiting professorship at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and he briefly was professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva until his death. Opinions He retained a lifelong interest in Canadian politics and was heavily critical of nationalist and interventionist policies that prevailed at his time. In his policy-oriented writings, he clearly showed his beliefs in personal freedom and markets. Selected works =Writings= Johnson published many works on international and monetary economics theory. He also wrote many works aimed at the general public and policymakers. According to Paul Samuelson, when Johnson died he had eighteen papers in proof: \\"That is dying with your boots on!\\" said Samuelson Johnson earned many honours. In 1977 he was named a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association, and in 1976 the Canadian government named him an officer of the Order of Canada.

Vaughan Expressway by the Yuma Metropolitan Planning Organization in honor of their executive director at the time) is a state highway in Yuma County, Arizona, United States, that serves the Yuma area. It begins in Yuma east of downtown, intersecting with Interstate 8 (I‑8) and heads south and then west, coming to an end at the intersection with Avenue E½ near San Luis. Route description SR 195 exists as mainly a divided highway that has been designed to be upgraded to a freeway in the future. History The only connection from I-8 to the San Luis Port of Entry was US 95, which runs as a surface street through the downtown business districts of Yuma, San Luis and Somerton. The area has experienced significant population growth since the 2000 Census. In the period from 2000–2005, the city of Yuma grew in population by 9.3%, the city of San Luis grew by 41.3%, and the town of Somerton grew by 38.6%, and anticipation that the growth trend will continue has fueled concerns about increasing traffic congestion. Additionally, the Yuma Metropolitan Planning Organization (YMPO) has estimated that commercial truck traffic through the San Luis port to increase to over 12,000 daily by 2015. Planning for the construction of SR 195 was implemented in response to these concerns. As of 1999, YMPO has secured an agreement with the state Department of Transportation to assist with funding for the project. In addition to addressing traffic concerns for the area, the highway will provide access for a proposed new port of entry east of San Luis. YMPO envisions these projects, along with potential expansion of cargo operations at the Yuma International Airport, as being parts of a concerted effort to increase the area's importance in regional and international trade and commerce. SR 195 was planned on November 15, 2002. Construction of the northern end of SR 195 began in late October 2007, and was completed September 2009.

It is named for the town of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in which it was first described. The Bloomsburg marked the first occurrence of red sedimentary rocks in the Appalachian Basin. Description The Bloomsburg is defined as a grayish-red and greenish-gray claystone, argillaceous siltstone, shale, and very fine to fine-grained sandstone, arranged in fining-upward cycles.Berg, T.M., Edmunds, W.E., Geyer, A.R. and others, compilers, (1980). Geologic Map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Map 1, scale 1:250,000. Although the Bloomsburg can sometimes be green to gray, its most dominant color is red and they are often called \\"The Bloomsburg Red Beds\\". This is significant in the Appalachian Basin since it marks the first large scale terrestrial collection of sediments in the rock record. Most of the sediments that were deposited before this time were marine, or a small scale terrestrial zone. In New Jersey, the Bloomsburg Red Beds were previously called the \\"High Falls Shale\\" or \\"High Falls Formation\\".Bloomsburg Red Beds =Depositional environment= The depositional environment of the Bloomsburg was mostly terrestrial or shallow marine deposits resulting in a molasse sequence produced by the Taconic orogeny. The red color is often evidence that the sediments were deposited in arid or oxidizing conditions. The upper parts of the Bloomsburg are thought to be a marine transition zone.Hoskins, D.M., (1961). Stratigraphy and paleontology of the Bloomsburg Formation of Pennsylvania and adjacent states: G36. Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Stratigraphy Early American geologists theorized that these beds correlated with Old Red Sandstone found in Scotland., but the Old Red Sandstone is Devonian in age, or much younger than the Bloomsburg. The Bloomsburg rests conformably above the Clinton Group and Shawangunk Formation, and has a complex upper contact. In eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the upper part of the Bloomsburg marks the Wallbridge Unconformity. To the west, the Wills Creek Formation lies conformably atop the Bloomsburg. Further west, the McKenzie Member of the Mifflintown Formation interfingers with the Bloomsburg and eventually, the Bloomsburg pinches out into the Mifflintown.Berg, T.M., et al., (1983). Stratigraphic Correlation Chart of Pennsylvania: G75, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. =Fossils= There are numerous fossils found in the Bloomsburg, mostly in the upper parts of the formation. There are trace fossils of early land plants and brachiopod fossils in the upper marine transitional zones. =Notable Exposures= Outcrop of the Bloomsburg Formation at Port Clinton * Roundtop Hill, Maryland, along railroad grade * Port Clinton, Pennsylvania, where bedding is nearly vertical and cleavage is visible * U.S. Route 22, 2.3 km northeast of Canoe CreekFaill, R.T., Glover, A.D., and Way, J.H., 1989, Geology and mineral resources of the Blandburg, Tipton, Altoona, and Bellwood quadrangles, Blair, Cambria, Clearfield and Centre Counties, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey Topographic and Geologic Atlas, 4th series, 86, 209 p., scale 1:24,000 and 1:48,000 Age Relative age dating of the Bloomsburg places it in the Upper Silurian period, being deposited between 417 and 410 (±5) million years ago.

His flirtatious relationship with his Welsh psychology teacher, Angie, is also made apparent. In \\"Cassie\\" he accidentally sees Angie naked in the teachers' showers, and later apologises. The episode \\"Chris\\" develops his character the most. He wakes up one morning having taken viagra which he did not need the night before, and comes downstairs to find his mum has run away and given him £1,000 to live off. After spending the money on a huge party, and embarrassing himself with his erection in front of Angie who came to the party, he finds himself homeless after he is kicked out by a squatter who is living in his stripped-down house, the contents of which he has had to sell. Chris is homeless and naked. He walks to school naked and goes to Angie for help and advice. His friends arrive and give him clothes, which Cassie Ainsworth and Maxxie charmed from boys in Unseen Skins' accompanying episode \\"A Friend in Need\\". Jal Fazer takes him to see his dad, who doesn't want anything to do with him or his mother, who is implied to be mentally unstable. Chris accidentally drops his baby half-brother, and runs as fast as he can to the graveyard, where he tells Jal the best day of his life when he was in the Scouts, when his older brother Peter helped him when Chris was humiliated. Once he finishes telling Jal his story, he stands up, revealing that the gravestone he was sitting at is in fact his older brother's. In the episode's conclusion, he is put up in a dorm room by a sympathetic Angie. Eventually, in \\"Maxxie and Anwar\\", Chris and Angie admit their feelings for each other. After fellow teacher Tom talks badly to Angie - whom he could not seduce – Chris tries to cheer her up, and they end up kissing, which leads to sex. They are caught by Maxxie, who is visibly shocked and hurriedly closes the door. Chris and Angie's relationship progresses throughout the series, until the series finale, when the return of Angie's fiancé Merve destroys their relationship, Chris realising he may lose Angie for good. He concludes that Merve is \\"obviously gay\\", after watching a videotape of Angie's that shows Merve as a campy weatherman on Australian television. Eventually, Chris takes Angie's engagement ring, and is confronted by Merve and two of his friends, and told to give it back. Chris denies he has it, and it is only when Angie eventually bursts in, and asks Chris to return it, that he complies. However, when he gives the ring back, Chris drops it, probably accidentally, and kneels down to pick it up, causing Anwar's uncle to think that Chris is proposing. Angie takes the ring, and runs off, leaving both Chris and Merve opposite one another. After she runs away, Chris comes to the conclusion that she loves him, and thus earns a punch from Merve, starting a minor brawl. In the closing montage, he and Angie are seen staring at each other with sad expressions through a window. In Chris's lost-week webisode, he is seen recording a message to Angie. =Series 2= In the first episode of the second season, Chris is seen with Maxxie and Jal trying to comfort and look after Tony Stonem following his accident. That night, they go to a party which they have tried to keep Tony from finding out about. In the next episode we learn that Angie has decided not to return to teach her class. She leaves a private message to Chris in code, but does not say goodbye to him explicitly. Chris is upset and confused about this, as he had been looking forward to Angie coming back, partly so that they could see each other again. After this, he goes on the camping trip for Michelle Richardson's birthday, and is attracted to her stepsister, Scarlett and spends the weekend complimenting her and looking at her breasts. Dempsie On The Stage in Skins Party 2007 In episode five of the second season, we see Jal and Chris make a deal that Chris will give his life a go and stop saying 'fuck it' and Jal will stop saying no to everything. After a number of unsuccessful jobs, Chris gets a job as a sales person and squats in one of the houses he is supposed to be selling, where Cassie moves in temporarily. Inevitably he and Jal end up getting together, and Chris' life begins to straighten up. Chris is performing exceptionally at work, and with support and affection from Jal he is genuinely happy for a change. However things lead to chaos when Cassie decides to have a house-warming party there and Angie turns up. The two have sex in the bathroom, however Chris abruptly stops when he thinks of Jal. Chris opens the bathroom door to leave and finds Jal outside, and she realises what has happened between him and Angie. Chris then attempts to get Jal back and invites her to the flat that Angie left him before leaving. They get back together, however he doesn't yet know that Jal is pregnant, with his baby. In episode eight Jal returns from her audition to find Chris has been taken to hospital because he has suffered a subarachnoid haemorrhage, a result of the hereditary condition that his brother died of previously. Jal tells a comatose Chris she is pregnant and gives him her lucky coin to take into an operation. In the series' penultimate episode, Chris's mother reappears but can't bear to visit him because his brother died from the same condition he has. Cassie overhears him crying because Jal wants an abortion and decides not to tell him about his mother. She tries to cheer Chris up and gives him a T-shirt with \\"Monkey Man\\" written on it. He tells her that he cannot wait to show it to someone. Chris then starts to feel funny and realizes that he cannot remember Jal's name. He runs out of the room and falls onto his bed. Cassie runs after him and then runs to find her phone. Cassie calls an ambulance then runs back to Chris. Chris has had a second subarachnoid hemorrhage and is now bleeding from his nose. He tells Cassie that he remembers Jal's name and then goes still. After witnessing Chris die in her arms, Cassie flees to New York in a state of severe shock. After Chris' father forbids Chris' friends from attending his funeral (because in his opinion they are the reason he had changed), Tony and Sid Jenkins decide to steal his body to hold their own funeral. However, Jal is distressed at this idea and she and Michelle persuade them to return the coffin to the hearse. Chris' friends decide to watch the funeral from afar, whilst Jal makes the following speech comparing Chris to one of his heroes, Captain Joe Kittinger, and referencing Kittinger's Project Excelsior: > “I've been thinking about what Chris would have wanted me to say today.

She was transferred to the Indonesian Navy as KRI Dumai (652) and served until 1984, when she was scrapped. History USS Tidewater was named for the Tidewater region of Virginia. Tidewater was laid down on 27 November 1944 at the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 30 June 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Robert N. S. Baker; and commissioned at Charleston Navy Yard on 19 February 1946 with Captain Frank H. Ball in command. =United States Navy (1946-1971)= Since World War II ended some five months before the destroyer tender was placed in commission, she remained active only long enough to complete sea trials. She did not report for duty with the active fleet, but was decommissioned and ordered to the reserve group berthed at Charleston. There, she became accommodation ship for members of the staff of the Commander, Submarine Group 3. That duty continued through the outbreak and first 15 months of the Korean War. By that time, the increased need for ships to support the United States Army fighting in that Asian country brought Tidewater into her first real active service. On 2 October 1951, Tidewater was recommissioned at Charleston, with Captain Harold S. Harnly in command. Tidewater, however, did not participate directly in the hostilities that brought her back to active duty. Instead, between late 1951 and early 1954, she operated exclusively along the eastern seaboard of the United States. After shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay area, she reported for duty with Destroyer Flotilla (DesFlot) 4 in February 1952. At her home port, Norfolk, Virginia, she supported the destroyers of DesFlot 4 with her repair facilities. Over the next two years, the ship departed that port on a number of occasions to participate in various exercises. During the fall of 1952, Tidewater joined ships of other NATO powers in Exercise \\"Mainbrace\\" for six weeks of training. The following February, she joined other Navy ships in the Caribbean for her first of many annual \\"Springboard\\" exercises, after which she resumed duty at Norfolk tending the destroyers of DesFlot 4. In July 1953, the destroyer tender moved south to Charleston to render her services to the ships of the Mine Force. She returned to Norfolk in mid-August and entered the naval shipyard for overhaul on the 12th. At the completion of overhaul, she put to sea for the Caribbean and refresher training on 2 November. Tidewater returned to Norfolk on 1 December and resumed tending destroyers until February 1954 when she headed south to participate in her second \\"Springboard\\" exercise. Upon completion of that duty, the destroyer tender headed across the Atlantic for her first deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. With that assignment, Tidewater set a pattern which endured for the remainder of her Navy career. Over the next 13 years, she made 10 deployments to the Mediterranean, alternating that service with 2nd Fleet duty along the Atlantic coast of the United States. During each tour of duty with the 6th Fleet, she made port calls at various harbors along the length of the \\"middle-sea\\" littoral. While serving on her fourth deployment in the summer of 1960, the destroyer tender had the honor to play host to Queen Frederica of Greece. Her eighth deployment to the Mediterranean came in the spring of 1967, just before the outbreak of the Six-Day War between the Arabs and Israel. During that brief conflict, Tidewater hurried to Souda Bay in Crete, where she served as an advanced base ship for 6th Fleet units standing watch in the eastern Mediterranean for the duration of hostilities. The Tidewater was relieved by the in Rota, Spain, August 1967. DASH hangar at the stern of the ship. This is her last configuration before being turned over to the Indonesian Navy. When not in the Mediterranean, she busied herself in support of the warships of the Atlantic Fleet from her base at Norfolk and at other ports along the eastern seaboard. When in the area, she joined in various exercises, most frequently in Operation \\"Springboard\\", the annual Caribbean-based exercise conducted by the ships of the Atlantic Fleet. She also underwent periodic overhauls to refurbish herself and modernize her equipment. The most significant of those occurred in June 1962 when, at the conclusion of her fifth Mediterranean tour, she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul which included the installation of a helicopter pad and concomitant equipment to expand her logistics support capabilities. Tidewater completed her tenth Mediterranean deployment on 2 May 1969. She resumed tender duty with the warships of the Atlantic Fleet out of Norfolk and remained so occupied through the end of the year and into 1970. In August 1970, she received word that she would be decommissioned the following spring. She served as flagship for the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 4, from 10 September until 13 November, at which time she began preparations for inactivation. =Indonesian Navy (1971-1984)= On 4 January 1971, the United States Navy agreed to lease Tidewater to the Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL) upon decommissioning. Accordingly, when she was placed out of commission at Norfolk on 20 February she was turned over to the Indonesian Navy and recommissioned as KRI Dumai (652), Colonel Mardianus Aruf in command. Dumai was purchased outright under the Security Assistance Program by Indonesia on 1 March 1980, and struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register. She went out of service in 1984 and was scrapped.

The \\"Grey Dog\\" tidal race, which runs in the sea channel to the south, reaches in full flood. The name 'Lunga' is derived from the Old Norse for 'isle of the longships', but almost all other place names are Gaelic in origin. The population was never substantial and today the main activity is an adventure centre on the northern headland of Rubha Fiola. The surrounding seas are fished for prawns and scallops and there is a salmon farm off the south eastern shores. The Special Area of Conservation of which the island is part hosts a growing number of outdoor leisure pursuits. Geography Lunga is west of the island of Luing and just north of Scarba. The nearest town is Oban some to the north. The channel to the south, Bealach a' Choin Ghlais (pass of the grey dog), is only wide and is scoured by the notorious 'Grey Dog' tidal race which reaches 8 knots when in full flood. According to an 1845 description: > ... about 1 cable broad, and the stream of water during the greater part of > ebb and flood rushes along the narrow pass with much violence. So great is > the overfall on the current, that even during moderate tides it is > impossible to force a boat through.Whirlpool Scotland Retrieved 26 February > 2007. This source is quoting Gillies, Patrick H. (1909) NetherLorn - > Argyllshire and its Neighbourhood. London. Virtue & Co. This strait is sometimes called the 'Little Corryvreckan' after its greater cousin between Scarba and Jura just a few miles to the south. There are numerous islets in the surrounding waters. To the north is the isle of Belnahua and to the north west are Eilean Dubh Mor and the Garvellachs. Due west there is only Dubh Artach lighthouse between Lunga and the open Atlantic Ocean. At high tide the northern tip of Lunga becomes several separate islets with Rubha Fiola (headland of the tidal island) to the north, then Fiola Meadhonach (middle tidal island), Eilean Ioasal (humble island) and Fiola an Droma (drum-shaped tidal island) closest to Lunga proper. All around are smaller skerries and islets, including Eilean a' Bhealaich (island of the pass), Guirasdeal to the south west and Fladda to the north. This complexity of land and sea coupled with the strong tides makes these the most treacherous channels on Scotland's west coast.Murray, W.H. (1977) The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland. London. Collins. The highest point is Bidean na h-Iolaire (peak of the eagle) and the main bay is Camas a Mhor-Fhir (bay of the giant) to the south which provides an escape route from the Grey Dog.Most English sources such as Murray (1977) tend to call the tidal current the Grey Dog (singular), although Haswell Smith (2004) and various websites refer to the 'Grey Dogs' (plural). The latter is consistent with the original Gaelic, although not the associated legend. It is possible that the English use of the singular is intended to refer to the tidal race, and the plural to the many standing waves it creates. The only other anchorage for passing yachts is at Poll nan Corran (the sickle shaped pool), on the east coast, which has a pebble beach. Geology Prior to the Pleistocene ice ages Lunga was part of a long peninsula stretching south west parallel to Kintyre. The Firth of Lorn glacier sliced this peninsula into several islands, including Islay, Jura, Scarba, Lunga, Luing and Seil. Later changes in sea level left raised beaches over much of the west coast of Scotland and Lunga has several examples. The bedrock of Lunga comprises a mixture of quartzite, limestone and shale called 'Scarba conglomerate' which predominates to the west and in the tidal islands to the north, with schist and mica-schist to the east. Unlike the other Slate Islands immediately to the north there is no commercially viable slate on Lunga, although the slate workers of Belnahua made use of the fresh water spring known as Tobar a Challuim-Chille (the well of St. Columba's church) north west of Bidean na h-Iolaire during times of drought. It is a trough, made up of flagstones, which reputedly never runs dry. History The legend associated with the Bealach a' Choin Ghlais is part of the same story that surrounds the naming of the nearby Gulf of Corryvreckan (English: the speckled cauldron). This is where the Norse Prince Breacan of Lochlann is said to have drowned when his boat sank there, so giving his name to this great whirlpool. The prince's dog managed to swim to land and went in search of his master. Failing to find him on Jura or Scarba he tried to leap across the strait to Lunga, but missed his footing on Eilean a' Bhealaich which sits in the middle of the channel between the two islands. He slipped into the raging current and drowned as well, giving his own name in turn to the strait where he fell - the 'pass of the grey dog'. Lunga was mentioned by Donald Monro in his 1549 manuscript Description of the Western Isles of Scotland. He stated that \\"Lunge\\" was \\"three myle of lenthe, twa pairt myle of breadthe, with a paroch kirk, guid main land, inhabit and manurit, guid for store and corn. It possist be M’Gillayne of Doward, in feu fra the earl of Ergile. It is a havin sufficient for Highland galeyis in it, layand from the southwest to northeist in lenthe.\\"Monro (1774) No. 31 In common with many of the remoter Scottish islands the human population experienced a decline during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The highest recorded number was 29 in 1794, declining to 15 by 1891 and only 5 by 1931. The graves of some of the islanders are to be found in the churchyard at Kilchattan on nearby Luing. Lunga was not permanently inhabited during the 1960s and 70s. Present day The island is owned by the family of convicted sex offender Torquil Johnson-Ferguson who runs the Rua Fiola adventure centre which caters for parties of school age children. The activities, which include rock climbing and canoeing, also make use of the nearby islets including Eilean Dubh Mor and Eilean Dubh Beag.Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre Retrieved 26 Feb 2007. The rest of Lunga itself, where there are only three houses, is primarily used for grazing animals. In 2001 the island had a population of 7 but in 2011 there were no \\"usual residents\\" living there as recorded by the census. Wildlife The surrounding seas are fished for prawns and scallops and there is a lease for a salmon farm off the south eastern shores of Lunga just north of the Bealach a' Choin Ghlais by the islet Sgeir Mhic an Altair. This part of the seabed is also a haven for the rare seafan anemone Amphianthus dohrnii.

In some sheltered locations with deeper water there are feather stars including Leptometra celtica and the hydroid Lytocarpia myriophyllum. On land the island is home to European otter and red deer. Atlantic grey seals, minke whale, bottlenose dolphin, and harbour porpoise are regular marine visitors. Golden and white-tailed sea eagles are also commonly sighted. The area is of growing importance for various leisure activities including scuba diving and canoeing. The island is part of the Scarba, Lunga and the Garvellachs National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotlands, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. It also forms part of the Firth of Lorn marine Special Area of Conservation.

The term shishi translates as \\"men of high purpose\\". While it is usually applied to the anti-shogunate, pro-sonnō jōi (尊皇攘夷; \\"Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian[s]\\") samurai primarily from the southwestern clans of Satsuma, Chōshū, and Tosa, the term shishi is also used by some with reference to supporters of the shogunate who held similar sonnō jōi views. There were many different varieties of shishi. Some, such as the assassins Kawakami Gensai, Nakamura Hanjirō, Okada Izō, and Tanaka Shinbei, opted for a more violent approach in asserting their views. Kawakami Gensai, in particular, is recalled as the assassin of Sakuma Shōzan, a renowned pro- Western thinker of the time. Several assaults on westerners in Japan have been attributed to the shishi and associated rōnin warriors. In a 2013 article, these assassins have been called \\"early terrorists\\" () since they opted to spread terror among the foreigners. Other more radical shishi, such as Miyabe Teizō, plotted large-scale attacks with little regard for public safety. Miyabe himself was one of the ringleaders of the plot, foiled by the Shinsengumi at the Ikedaya Incident, to burn Kyoto at the height of the Gion Festival. As mentioned above, shishi were not necessarily in support of bringing down the shogunate. Shishi from Mito were responsible for the death of the shogunal grand councilor Ii Naosuke, who was a signatory to treaties that favored foreign nations, and who had placed an underaged boy on the shogunal throne. Other Mito men and women arose in the Tengutō Rebellion, over the next several years. While these were definitely actions against the shōgun's government, they did not oppose the shōgun himself—indeed, the Mito shishi, who were retainers of a relative of the shōgun, believed they were only helping him. Other shishi had more scholastic leanings. A prime example of this was the scholar Yoshida Shōin of Chōshū. He founded the Shokason-juku school, and educated many of the future government leaders of Meiji era Japan. Yoshida had connections to many prominent figures of the Bakumatsu era: Kawai Tsugunosuke, Katsu Kaishū, the aforementioned Sakuma Shōzan, and others. The more radical shishi from Chōshū and Satsuma went on to form the core leadership of the nascent Meiji Government. Some, such as Itō Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo, remained prominent figures in Japanese politics and society until the early decades of the 20th century.

Location  The park is located near the Clifton Beach, Karachi and is Karachi's largest urban park, covering . The northern edge begins at Jehangir Kothari Parade, and ends near the coast of the Arabian Sea. The encompasses the Jehangir Kothari Parade, built in 1919, as well as the Katrak Bandstand. The Lady Lloyd Pier, built in 1921, stretched from what is today Shahrah-e-Firdousi to the waterline of the shore through what is today the park. Two historic fountains are situated within the park, the Pirojbai Hormusji Khajurina Fountain from 1936, and the Motumal Shewaram Setpal Fountain, also from 1936.  History  The park encompasses what was previously known as the Rupchand Bilaram Park, which was almost in size. In 1964, the park's size was reduced to 132 acres after the Karachi Municipal Corporation leased out land for development. In 1966, the Karachi Development Authority assumed control of the park, and in 1974 renovated several structures in the park. A sea wall to the east was made at this time, which lead to the coastline retreating further from the southern edge of the park. The Jehangir Kothari Parade, Katrak Bandstand, Lady Lloyd Pier, and the 2 fountains were protected in 1994 by the Sindh Cultural Heritage Preservation Act. In the years afterwards the area fell into gradual decay as successive governments neglected to maintain the site, and by 2001 was barren and considered a \\"virtual wasteland.\\" Katrak Bandstand was built in 1920, and is now at the northern edge of the park Construction on the new park began on 22 July 2005.

In April 2017, the park again was renovated by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, and the park was re-opened by Prime Minister Imran Khan on 30 March 2019. In October 2019, the park hosted the opening of the Karachi Biennale.  Features  The park is spread over near the Arabian Sea coast. The northern edge of the park includes the 1919 Jehangir Kothari Parade, the Katrak Bandstand, and former Karachi Aquarium. The 1921 Lady Lloyd Pier begins at the northern edge of the park near the Jehangir Kothari Parade, and extends into the park.

Early career Jacqueline Foster was born in Liverpool and educated at Prescot Girls' Grammar School. She worked for British Airways for more than twenty years. Between 1981 and '85 she left British Airways and became the Area Manager (Austria) for Horizon, a British Tour Operator before returning to British Airways four years later. In 1989, she was one of the founder members of Cabin Crew '89, an independent trade union and served as the Deputy General Secretary. She continued with British Airways until she was elected as an MEP in 1999. She also lived and worked in France and Spain. She speaks French and German. Political involvement In 1988, following Margaret Thatcher's Bruges Speech, she publicly opposed Britain joining a single European currency as well as signing up to the Social Chapter. With her experience living and working in Europe, she has always maintained a constructive Euro-scepticism which remains to this day. Foster combined her trade union activities with active membership of the Conservative Party, serving as Vice Chairman of Twickenham Conservative Association as well as holding a variety of voluntary political offices for the Greater London area. In the 1992 general election, she was the Conservative candidate in Newham South, a Labour-held seat in east London. Against the national trend, Foster cut the Labour majority. She was shortlisted as the candidate for Eastleigh in the by-election of 1994 but lost out in selection. 1997 UK General Election She continued to look for selection and in November 1995 was narrowly beaten by Eric Forth in the selection for Bromley and Chislehurst. In August 1996 she was selected for the marginal seat of Peterborough, where sitting Conservative MP Brian Mawhinney was moving to an adjacent constituency. She moved to Peterborough to fight the campaign and was among the Conservative candidates at that election who declared their personal opposition to the single European currency. The result of the 1997 general election was a landslide win for the Labour Party. 1999 European Election At the 1999 European Parliament election, Foster was selected by Conservatives in the North West as fifth on their list. She won the last seat available on the list system. Work as an MEP During this first mandate (1999-2004), she was elected annually as the chairman of the Backbench Committee of MEPs. Her political responsibilities were as the Conservative Spokesman on Transport and Tourism and as a Member of the Industry Committee. Due to her professional expertise she specialised in the aviation sector. Other responsibilities included maritime, road and rail. Following 9/11 Foster was the Rapporteur/draftsman for the Regulation which introduced minimum standards of security at airports across Europe. This included new rules which required airport staff to be security screened when entering secure areas, as was the case in the United Kingdom. The European Parliament agreed but the European Council of Ministers put off negotiations due to opposition by the governments of the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Germany. Nevertheless, the legislation went through. She supported moves to require airlines to compensate passengers 'bumped' off flights. Other key areas she focused on included: * Single European Sky, ATM, GNSS, Galileo (new satellite systems); * The creation of the European Air Safety Agency (EASA); * Slots, ground- handling and passenger rights; * Crew operations and Open Skies agreements. She was also a pro-active member of the Sky & Space Parliamentary Intergroup. She was a member of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Joint Parliamentary Assembly (ACP) and became the spokesman for the Parliament on Zimbabwe, following which she was subsequently banned from entering the country. Defeat 2004 and Re-election 2009 Jacqueline was re-selected to fight the 2004 European Parliament election in fourth position on the Conservative list, so was not re-elected when the Conservatives won only three seats. Having specialised in the aviation sector, she became an adviser to Airbus on EU legislation following which she was appointed Head of European Affairs for the Aerospace, Space and Defence Industries of Europe (ASD), based in Brussels (2005-2009). She continues to maintain an active role in these areas as Vice President of the Sky & Space Parliamentary Intergroup. In 2009 she was placed third on the Conservative list for the North West region in the European Parliament election and was elected once again as an MEP, with the Conservatives winning three seats for a second time. She was, again, appointed as the Transport Spokesman and also served as a Vice President of the Sky & Space and Animal Welfare Parliamentary Intergroups and as a Member of the EU- US Delegation. She was elected as Deputy Leader of the Conservative delegation of MEPs in 2013, and has been re-elected annually. In 2013, she argued against the Conservative Party having an electoral pact with UK Independence Party. 2014 European Election Foster topped the ballot of the North West Candidates list for the 2014 European Parliament election. The Conservatives retained two MEPs. Following the Election she was again re-appointed as a Transport Spokesman, specialising in the aviation and aerospace sectors. She is the draftsman of the groundbreaking 'Report on the Safe Use of RPAS' (drones) in the civil sector. She continues to work closely on security issues with American authorities and other key countries around the globe. She was re-elected as a Vice-President of both the Sky & Space and Animal Welfare Parliamentary Intergroups. She has remained a Member of the EU/US Parliamentary Delegation and was appointed a Vice-President of the Australia/New Zealand Delegation where the focus is now on securing trade deals. She has regularly been invited to address aviation/aerospace conferences, such as the Royal Aeronautical Society (drones & emissions trading), as well as frequently being called upon for political comment on all aspects of both sectors. She is a member of the RAeS as well as the European Aviation Club. Foster also took an active role on issues surrounding the Maritime sector and served as a Director and Board Member of Mersey Maritime Ltd. from 2016 to June 2019. Foster was re-elected again, unopposed, as Deputy Leader of the Conservative delegation of MEPs in November 2018. She stood down at the end of the 2014-2019 mandate and did not contest the 2019 European Election in May. She was appointed President of the North West Conservative Clubs in 2010, a position she still holds. Foster was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours.

It is located in the village of Tingvollvågen. It is the church for the Tingvoll parish which is part of the Indre Nordmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre. The white, stone church was built in a long church style during the second half of the 1100s by an unknown architect. The church seats about 430 people. History The church is one of the few remaining old stone churches that was built in Norway. There is some uncertainty as to when it was actually constructed, but records indicate it was between 1150 and 1200. The approximately 800-year-old Romanesque style Tingvoll church and the large angular farmhouse beside it, lie on a spot on the north side of the Tingvollfjorden, just outside the village of Tingvollvågen off of Norwegian National Road 70 (Rv70). The first mention of the church in existing historical records dates back to 1357 The church was built here, since during the pre-Christian era, Tingvoll was an assembly place () for all of the Nordmøre region. As a consequence the church is sometimes called Nordmørsdomen, meaning the Nordmøre cathedral. Design The church is long and the steeple and spire (added in 1787) is tall. The thick walls have corridors inside, both on the south side and on the north side. The corridors lead to steep stairs up to the crown of the wall under the rafters and then down again with the same steep pitch. It is a mystery why they were constructed. So also a balcony outside under the gable, located above the chancel. The church is richly decorated. From the painted walls in the weaponhouse, the whitewash paintings inside the nave, to the arc ceiling in the chancel which is adorned with stars and half moons. In the chancel wall, behind the top of the altarpiece, there is a marble rock with runic inscriptions. This inscription contains a prayer and also what is believed to be the name of a person named Gunnar who built the church. In 1928-1929 the church underwent some restoration work.

In Michigan, it is a state trunkline highway that runs from the Indiana–Michigan state line at Bertrand Township north to its terminus at Interstate 75 (I-75) south of Mackinaw City. Along its route, US 31 follows the Michigan section of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway as well as other freeways and divided highways northward to Ludington. North of there, the trunkline is a rural undivided highway through the Northern Michigan tourist destinations of Traverse City and Petoskey before terminating south of Mackinaw City. Along its route, US 31 has been dedicated in memory of a few different organizations, and sections of it carry the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) moniker. Four bridges used by the highway have been recognized for their historic character as well. The first highways along the route of the modern US 31 corridor were the West Michigan Pike, an auto trail from 1913, and later a pair of state trunklines (the original M-11 and M-58) in 1919. These state highways were redesignated US 31 on November 11, 1926, when the US Highway System was approved. Since then, the highway has been realigned in places. The highway crossed the Straits of Mackinac by ferry for about a decade in the 1920s and 1930s before the Mackinac Bridge was built, connecting to US 2 north of St. Ignace. Later, sections were converted into freeways starting in the 1950s. These segments opened through the subsequent decades with the last one opening in 2003. Future plans by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) are to finish the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and bypass Grand Haven. Route description Between Lake Michigan Beach and the northern terminus south of Mackinaw City, most of US 31 forms a portion of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) except where the various business loops run between the main highway and Lake Michigan. Additionally, much of the highway from the Indiana–Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards. Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-94 near Benton Harbor, and between Holland and Ferrysburg. The remainder of US 31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes. The entire length of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility. =St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-196= US 31 and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway crosses into Michigan from Indiana southwest of Niles and parallels the St. Joseph River as the two run northward through southwest Michigan. The freeway passes through farmland before crossing US 12 at the first of a set of three interchanges located between Niles on the east and Buchanan on the west. US 31 crosses the river north of the interchange with Niles–Buchanan Road. North of the Walton Road interchange, the freeway turns northwesterly to recross the St. Joseph River near Lake Chapin south of Berrien Springs. The parkway curves around the west side of town before crossing the river for a third time. As US 31 continues northward parallel to the river, it enters the eastern fringes of the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area. Traffic is forced to exit the freeway at the interchange with Napier Road although the freeway continues northward for less than . After separating from its freeway, US 31 turns west along Napier Avenue for about before meeting I-94 and merging with it. I-94/US 31 runs concurrently on a northeasterly course through a partial interchange with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) before meeting the southern end of I-196 in Benton Charter Township. At this trumpet interchange, I-196/US 31 runs north from I-94 and passes to the west of the Point O'Woods Golf & Country Club. It continues northward in rural Berrien County through farm fields. The trunkline turns northwesterly near the Lake Michigan Hills Golf Course and crosses the Paw Paw River. Past the river, the freeway turns northeasterly and runs roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline several miles inland. At the community of Lake Michigan Beach, I-196/US 31 meets the northern terminus of M-63 at exit 7, and the LMCT joins the freeway for the first time. North of this interchange, the freeway parallels a county road (A-2, the Blue Star Highway) that is the former route of US 31. alt=Photograph Further north, I-196/US 31 crosses into Van Buren County and assumes the Gerald R. Ford Freeway name. The inland side of the freeway is forested while the lakeward side is predominantly either forest or fields. As it approaches South Haven, the freeway passes near the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station and Van Buren State Park. North of the power plant and park, the freeway turns farther inland to bypass the city of South Haven. There is an interchange on the south side of town that provides access to BL I-196 and M-140. The freeway crosses over M-43 without an interchange and then intersects the other end of the business loop about later. It crosses the Black River near the Van Buren–Allegan county line. In Allegan County, I-196/US 31 passes a pair of golf courses and continues northward through farm fields. Near the community of Glenn, A-2 crosses over the freeway and runs parallel to it on the east. The two roads trade places again when I-196/US 31 turns northeasterly on the south side of the twin cities of Saugatuck and Douglas. The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the Kalamazoo River that flows between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US 31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland. On the south side of Holland, US 31 and I-196 separate as the Interstate turns northeasterly around the city to continue to Grand Rapids. US 31 follows the BL I-196 freeway northward into Holland around the north side of the West Michigan Regional Airport. The business loop has an interchange for A-2 (Blue Star Highway) and Washington Avenue before the freeway ends in the southern reaches of Holland. The trunkline then runs as a divided highway northward, bypassing downtown Holland to the east and intersecting M-40. Northeast of downtown Holland, BL I-196 leaves US 31 and the LMCT at an interchange to follow an expressway along the route of Chicago Drive while US 31 turns northwesterly on its own expressway alignment. =West Michigan= Northwest of Holland, the highway runs as a four-lane expressway and divided highway parallel, but inland from, the Lake Michigan shoreline. This section of US 31 runs through a mix of farm fields and forests as it runs to the community of Agnew. There, US 31 intersects the western end of M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) before continuing into the southern end of Grand Haven. In that city, the highway follows a four-lane boulevard with a grass median. On the northern edge of the city of Grand Haven, US 31 crosses the Grand River on a bascule bridge that opens about 450–500 times per year. North of the structure, US 31 transitions into a freeway at the interchange with the western end of M-104 in Ferrysburg. This freeway continues northward through the suburban edges of the Muskegon area and meets the western end of I-96 near the Muskegon County Airport in Norton Shores. At this interchange with I-96, US 31 has its southernmost business loop as U.S. Route 31 Business runs westerly and northward into downtown Muskegon. The main freeway continues through the suburban eastern edge of the city through several interchanges, including one with M-46 (Apple Avenue). Just south of the Muskegon River, the business loop merges back into the main freeway. US 31 crosses the river and turns northwesterly through forests. The freeway passes to the east of Michigan's Adventure, an amusement park, and crosses the White River near the communities of Whitehall and Montague; a business loop curves off to the west to connect the two communities with the freeway. In this area, US 31 runs through the southern portion of the Manistee National Forest as well. Rothbury alt=Photograph looking southbound As the freeway continues northward, US 31 intersects the western end of M-20 in New Era in Oceana County. The landscape in this area is dominated by forest land as the trunkline crosses the Hart-Montague Trail State Park, a linear state park that follows a bike trail in the area. North of the trail crossing, US 31 has a business spur for Hart that runs east into that town; north of this interchange, the freeway crosses the Pentwater River near the community of Pentwater which also has its own business loop. North of Pentwater, US 31 crosses into Mason County and passes Bass Lake and the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, which uses a reservoir next to the freeway to generate electricity. Just north of that reservoir, the freeway turns to the northeast and Ludington's business spur runs off to the northwest. US 31 curves around the east side of Ludington, crossing the Pere Marquette River. Due east of downtown, the freeway ends and US 31 turns east to merge with US 10\\\\. The concurrent highways follow a four-lane roadway to Scottville. On the west side of that town, US 31 separates from US 10, turning northward to bypass Scottville. =Northwest Michigan= alt=Photograph US 31 runs due north through Northwest Michigan forest land bypassing Freesoil to the west. Northwest of that town, the highway crosses the Big Sable River before entering Manistee County. Across the county line, the trunkline runs northwesterly parallel to Manistee Lake as US 31 enters Manistee. The highway follows Cypress Street to a drawbridge over the Manistee River and then Cleveland Street on the northern side. As the trunkline rounds the northern shore of Manistee Lake, it passes the SS City of Milwaukee, a car ferry preserved as a museum. From there, the highway runs northeasterly, intersecting the western end of M-55 (Caberfae Highway). Next to the Little River Casino, the highway intersects the southern end of M-22 (Orchard Highway), and the LMCT separates from US 31. The highway continues on a northeasterly course running inland along Chippewa Highway to the community of Bear Lake. US 31 rounds the east side of the community's namesake body of water on Lake Street and exits town on Pleasanton Highway. The trunkline continues northward and northeasterly through Pleasanton and crosses into Benzie County. Over the county line, it follows Benzie Highway northward to an intersection with M-115 (Cadillac Highway). The two merge and run north into Benzonia, following Michigan Avenue in town. Near the south shore of Crystal Lake, M-115 turns westward toward Frankfort and US 31 follows Michigan Avenue into Beulah, running around the eastern end of the lake. Near the eastern end of Platte Lake, US 31 turns to run easterly into Honor before crossing into Grand Traverse County. Across the county line, US 31 continues eastward, passing north of the community of Interlochen, intersecting the former M-137, which connected to Interlochen State Park. The highway then angles northeasterly north of Duck Lake and south of Silver Lake. A few miles farther east, US 31 meets M-37 at a location known as Chums Corners. The two highways join and run northward through the unincorporated community. It passes Turtle Creek Stadium, the home stadium for the Traverse City Pit Spitters, a minor- league baseball team. From there, US 31/M-37 runs downhill into Garfield Township. In this area, the highway passes through a cluster of retail stores and car dealerships near the Grand Traverse Mall. North of the intersection with 14th Street, the trunkline follows Division Street into Traverse City. From there it runs to the east of Grand Traverse Commons, the former Traverse City State Hospital, before US 31/M-37 meets Grandview Parkway next to the West Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. alt=Photograph At that intersection, the trunkline meets the northern end of M-22, which is running concurrently with M-72 along the parkway. As US 31/M-37 turns east to run along the bay north of downtown, the highway merges with M-72 and picks up the LMCT again. Grandview Parkway runs between the Boardman River and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US 31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward to run up the Old Mission Peninsula, and US 31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. The highway runs north of the Cherry Capital Airport near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to Traverse City State Park. East of the park, the trunkline exits suburban Traverse City and rounds the bay to run northward along its eastern shore. In the community of Acme, M-72 turns eastward while US 31 continues north past the Grand Traverse Resort. About north of Acme, US 31 crosses into Antrim County as it runs between Elk Lake and the Grand Traverse Bay. Between towns, the landscape is mostly agricultural lands with mixed patches of forest. A few miles north of the county line, the trunkline passes through Elk Rapids and crosses a channel connecting the Spencer Bay portion of Elk Lake to Lake Michigan. North of this crossing, US 31 continues northeasterly, running on an isthmus between Torch Lake and Grand Traverse Bay. The highway passes through Eastport at the northern end of Torch Lake and intersects the western end of M-88. Further north, US 31 runs through Atwood and crosses into Charlevoix County. =North to the Straits Area= alt= Photograph showing US 31 As US 31 curves around to the northeast and east in Charlevoix County, it follows a section of the Lake Michigan shoreline that is not considered to be part of any bay. The highway continues through Northern Michigan agricultural areas to the southeast of Charlevoix. Once it enters the city, the trunkline intersects the northern end of M-66 and follows a series of city streets to a drawbridge over the channel that connects Lake Charlevoix to Lake Michigan. South of the structure it is Bridge Street, and north of the bridge it is Michigan Avenue. The highway turns eastward to exit town on Petoskey Avenue and follow the Lake Michigan shoreline. Near the community of Bay Shore, US 31 crosses into Emmet County. The trunkline continues past the Bay Harbor development on Charlevoix Avenue into the city of Petoskey. Once in Petoskey, US 31 intersects the northern end of US 131 (Spring Street) and turns northward along Spring Street through downtown. The highway curves around to follow Mitchell Street to cross the Bear River and then follow Bay View Road. US 31 runs along the Little Traverse Bay through the eastern end of Petoskey and into Bay View. From there, it intersects the southern end of M-119 and passes through a pair of small towns, Conway and Oden, that border inland lakes like Round Lake and various bays of Crooked Lake. alt=Photograph North of Oden, US 31 runs through Ponshewaing before entering the village of Alanson. There the highway intersects the western end of M-68 and runs parallel to the Crooked River, part of the Inland Waterway. North of town, US 31 runs through the town of Brutus before entering Pellston. The highway runs past the Pellston Regional Airport and continues due north to Levering. From there, US 31 turns northwesterly and then northeasterly on Mackinaw Highway to round Lake Paradise in the community of Carp Lake. North of the lake, US 31 follows a limited-access highway into Cheboygan County. Less than east of the county line, US 31 connects to I-75 in a partial interchange. At this interchange, northbound traffic defaults onto northbound I-75 and US 31 terminates. History =Predecessor highways= alt= Map The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails. Only one of these followed part of the path of US 31; the Mackinac Trail roughly paralleled the route of US 31 from Petoskey northward. In the age of the auto trail, the roads that later formed US 31 through Michigan were given a few different highway names. The West Michigan Lake Shore Highway Association was founded on January 10, 1912, and the group reorganized on May 30, 1913, as the West Michigan Pike Association. Their auto trail was marked by a series of concrete markers tall along the roadway from the Indiana state line northward to Mackinaw City. The highway was also a part of the Western Mainline of the Dixie Highway in Michigan, another auto trail that was built starting in 1915. In 1916, the northern junction between the West Michigan Pike and the East Michigan Pike, which served as the connection for the two mainlines of the Dixie Highway in Michigan in Mackinaw City, was marked with a stone monument at the junction of Central Avenue and Huron Street. By the middle of 1921, the trail used about of roadways along its western branch parallel to Lake Michigan. Michigan led all other states in the Dixie Highway Association by 1922 at improvements to its sections of the roadway. The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the Michigan Legislature; at the time, one of the system's divisions corresponded to US 31\\\\. Division 5 followed a course from Niles northward to Mackinaw City. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and the future US 31 corridor was assigned two numbers. From the state line north through Niles to St. Joseph, it carried the original M-58 designation and from there northward it was the original M-11. =US Highway System era= The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved the United States Numbered Highway System on November 11, 1926, and the MSHD designated US 31 in Michigan according to AASHO's plan to run northward from the Indiana state line and along the Lake Michigan shoreline to Mackinaw City. A section in the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area overlapped US 12 and the modern concurrency with US 10 was also in place. By the end of the next year, the highway was extended across the Straits of Mackinac on the state car ferries to connect to US 2 in the Upper Peninsula north of St. Ignace. In 1930, Muskegon was bypassed; the new highway east of downtown was numbered US 31A. alt=Map By the end of 1936, the last section of US 31 in the state was paved near Charlevoix, making the entire highway in Michigan a hard-surfaced road. Early the next year, the route of US 2 was realigned to run into St. Ignace; after the change, US 2 and US 31 ran concurrently. Later that year, a set of curves were straightened out south of Ludington and the routes of US 31 and a US 31A between Saugatuck and Holland were switched, and US 31 was realigned to bypass downtown Ludington. In 1938, the southern end of US 31 was given a second designation when US 33 was extended into the state from Indiana to terminate in St. Joseph. Later that year, the US 31A in the Holland area was decommissioned. The next year, the US 31 concurrency was removed from US 2 in the Upper Peninsula and the former highway no longer crossed the Straits of Mackinac, terminating instead in Mackinaw City. By the early 1940, the Muskegon Bypass was given the US 31 designation, and the route downtown was redesignated US 31A. During World War II, a bypass of downtown South Haven was built; the former route of US 31 through the heart of the city was designated Bus. US 31 at that time. After the war, the route of US 31 north of Charlevoix was realigned to follow the shoreline; this section opened by the middle of 1949. The route of the highway between Holland and West Olive was changed to run on a more angular course northwesterly in 1950. A few years later, a bypass to the south and east of Holland opened and the former route through down was redesignated as a business loop in 1954. =Freeway era= On November 1, 1957, the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic. For the opening of the bridge, the highways coming into Mackinaw City from the south were realigned to connect to it; US 31 terminated at the southern approach to the Mackinac Bridge.. In November 1960, sections of I-75's freeway opened from Indian River north to the southern Mackinac Bridge approaches, and US 31 was rerouted to follow segments of that freeway from the current northern terminus south of Mackinaw City northward. By the end of the decade, another freeway segment opened along the Muskegon Bypass as well. The next year, US 33 was extended northward along US 31 from St. Joseph for about . In 1962, a section of freeway along US 31 was opened between I-94 and the Berrien–Van Buren county line. This section was originally designated as part of I-96/US 31; the former route near the lakeshore became just US 33. The MSHD petitioned federal highway officials to switch the Interstate designations west of Grand Rapids, reversing the I-96 and I-196 numbers to their current configurations. After the designation switch was approved in 1963, an additional was opened from the northern end of the freeway near Benton Harbor to Holland as I-196/US 31. The freeway was also extended northward from Muskegon to the Muskegon–Oceana county line north of Montague in 1963. When I-196 was completed between Holland and Grandville in 1974, the BL I-196 designation was applied along US 31 and Bus. US 31. The next year, the US 31 freeway was extended northward into Oceana County to New Era. In 1976, this freeway was lengthened further to Hart. The section of I-196/US 31 in all but Berrien County was dedicated as the \\"Gerald R. Ford Freeway\\" in July 1978. Also that year, the US 31 freeway was extended to the southern side of Pentwater. alt=Photograph looking southbound at the Bus. US 31 interchange for Pentwater At the end of the 1970s and into the early 1990s, US 31 gained additional freeway segments on both ends of the highway. The first section of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway was completed in 1979 and ran from the Indiana state line north to US 12. The freeway was extended northward from Pentwater to the Oceana–Mason county line in 1980. Construction of the Niles Bypass was finished in 1987, bringing the parkway north to Walton Road northwest of Niles. Bus. US 31 was created along the former routing in Niles. The northern freeway was extended further into Mason County in two stages. In 1989, it was expanded to the south side of Ludington. The next year, Ludington was bypassed, completing the freeway to its current northern end at US 10 east of town. One more bypass, this time a non-freeway routing to the west of Scottville, opened in 1991. The Berrien Springs Bypass was completed in late 1992. Since then, MDOT built a freeway segment north from Berrien Springs to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27, 2003, at a cost of $97 million (equivalent to $ in ). The last change to the routing of US 31 occurred in August 2004 when the route of Bus. US 31 in Holland was turned back to local control; BL I-196 was rerouted to follow US 31 around downtown instead of following the former business loop through it. Starting in 1996, Traverse City-area residents and tourists requested a freeway bypass the city. These residents decided to not build the highway. In 2001, The idea was revived, but MDOT abandoned these plans in June of that year. Future =Completion of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway= alt=Close-up photograph The MSHD started studies for a freeway routing of US 31 from the state line northward to I-94 in 1967. The first section northward to Niles was approved in 1972, and the remainder of the route was approved in 1981. Since then, MDOT re-evaluated the St. Joseph Valley Parkway extension east of Benton Harbor, due to environmental, economic, and historical site issues. One of the environmental concerns that was studied relates to the habitat of an endangered species, the Mitchell's satyr butterfly, which has its habitat in the area of the proposed freeway. The habitat is home to the second-largest population of the rare butterfly. The freeway between Niles and Benton Harbor was planned as a series of five segments when approved in 1981. Since that approval, the butterfly was discovered in the Blue Creek Fen in the late 1980s, and it was listed as an endangered species in 1992. This listing stalled MDOT's planning and construction of the fifth freeway segment north of Berrien Springs. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued an opinion two years later that the project would jeopardize the species. MDOT was given permission to modify the previously approved freeway to cross the Blue Creek on longer bridges; the USFWS also required that any construction be done from elevated platforms, among other restrictions. In the interim, MDOT proceeded with construction of the southern portion of the last freeway segment, completing it northward from Berrien Springs to the Napier Avenue interchange in August 2003. A revised environmental impact study to account for the butterfly's habitat in the northern area of the freeway was approved in 2004. The study compared the original routing for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with an alternate route that involved an indirect connection via the BL I-94 interchange and an I-94 concurrency near Benton Harbor. The study recommended using a version of the alternate connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen, both to save money and decrease impact to the Mitchell's satyr. At the time the freeway segment opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but since then, funding has not been available. MDOT did not include construction of the extension for this reason in the department's 2014–18 highway projects plan released in 2013, although most of the design work and land acquisition has been completed. Until the missing freeway segment is built, US 31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US 31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange and additional lanes will be added to I-94 as well. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section. MDOT's 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016 split the remaining work into three phases. The department has listed funding for only the first two of these three phases, and construction is anticipated to start in 2021. On December 6, 2018, MDOT announced that a $20 million discretionary grant had been received to complete the final phase of construction, building the last of freeway required to connect US 31 to I-94. =Bypassing Grand Haven= , travelers had to use either US 31 through Grand Haven or 68th Avenue through Eastmanville to cross the Grand River in Ottawa County. A new highway, part of a long-range plan to build a US 31 bypass of Grand Haven, provides a river crossing almost equidistant between the two, greatly reducing drive times between areas north and south of the river. A drive from Nunica to Robinson is a trip; the new highway provides a route closer to in length. Called M-231, this highway is a scaled-down bypass of US 31 through Grand Haven, even though it will not physically connect to US 31. By January 4, 2013, MDOT had completed work for this highway, including a bridge over North Cedar Drive, additional ramps at the I-96 and M-104 interchange, and reconstruction and widening of M-104 near I-96. The department had also completed a reconfiguration of the intersection between M-104 and Cleveland Drive and widening the bridge that carries M-104 over I-96. The expected date of completion for M-231 was set for sometime in 2016 pending funding availability. MDOT planned to build of the new highway starting in 2013, including the bridges over the Grand River and Little Robinson Creek. The 2005 SAFETEA-LU transportation bill provided funding earmarked for the project by US Representative Pete Hoekstra from Holland as well as matching funds from the state's Michigan Jobs Today program. The total cost of the project was expected to be near $150 million. On October 30, 2015, the highway opened to traffic. Memorial designations and tourist routes The sections of the route of US 31 in Michigan has been dedicated several times to various organizations. The route of US 33 in the state, which at the time was concurrent with US 31, was dedicated as the Blue & Gray Trail in 1938 to honor veterans of the American Civil War.. The Blue Star Memorial Highway designation was applied to the highway to honor those serving in the military. The designation was dedicated on October 10, 1948, by the State Highway Commissioner Charles Ziegler.. In 1917, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau created a tourist route that is a predecessor of the modern Great Lakes Circle Tours (GLCT). The Great Lakes Automobile Route was a series of roads on both the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan. It included US 31 between Manistee and the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area. The concept did not last a year; the American entry into World War I and a lack of focus on a single route consigned the idea into obscurity.. The idea of a tourist route around the Great Lakes was revived in 1986 as a pet project of Michigan First Lady Paula Blanchard. MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario created the GLCT scheme which includes the LMCT that follows US 31 from Lake Michigan Beach northward to Manistee and from Traverse City north to the terminus near Mackinaw City excluding locations where business loops run closer to the lake at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater. A group of area residents initiated an effort to have the former West Michigan Pike designated what is now called a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group was in the process of securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US 31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater. Historic bridges alt=Aerial photograph MDOT maintains a listing of the historic bridges in the state; along US 31, the department has listed four structures. In downtown Charlevoix, the US-31–Island Lake Outlet Bridge carries the highway over a channel dredged between Lake Michigan and Round Lake that also connects to Lake Charlevoix. Built from 1947 through 1949, it is the fifth bridge at the location. It is a double-leaf bascule bridge. In Petoskey, the highway crosses Bear Creek on a concrete girder bridge built in 1930. At in length, it is the fourth longest such bridge in Michigan. In Manistee, the Manistee River is spanned by a double-leaf bascule bridge built in 1933.. North of Hart in Pentwater Township, the US 31–Pentwater River Bridge is a long-span steel bridge that crosses the Pentwater River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 20, 1999. It carries Oceana Drive along a former routing of US 31.

Route description SR 273 looking south, between MP 388 and MP 389 The northern terminus of SR 273 is located at SR 260 within the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. SR 273 was designated in 1955 from SR 73 (this section now part of SR 260) southeast and northeast to SR 73, with a spur southeast. On August 16, 1991, the section from the spur northeast was renumbered as SR 261. SR 273 was rerouted over SR 273 spur, eliminating the duplication of mileposts. It heads southeast from this intersection and passes along the east side of Sunrise Lake. The highway curves towards the east to the south of Sunrise Lake as it heads towards White Mountain Reservoir. The highway leaves the Indian Reservation as it approaches the reservoir. It curves towards the southeast as it passes the reservoir. It curves towards the south as it intersects National Forest Service Road 87. The highway continues towards the south before curving back towards the east to a junction with SR 261. The highway curves back towards the south at this intersection.

Early life and education Livingstone was born in Fall River, Massachusetts,U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925 the daughter of Charles Devall Stickney of Fall River and Florence Sutherland Orr of Taunton. She was educated privately in the United States, Italy, France and Germany. International work At the outbreak of the First World War, Livingstone arrived in England, where she took a leading role in the repatriation of women and children in Germany and other axis nations. Her work was given recognition and in May 1915, the same month she married Captain William Henry Darley Livingstone of the Northumberland Fusiliers, the British government appointed her to a committee on the treatment of British prisoners of war. As part of her work on the committee, known as the Government Committee on the Treatment by the Enemy of British Prisoners of War, she made several trips to Switzerland to establish a system of examining prisoners transferred from Germany. She was also sent to the Netherlands as a member of a British delegation that met with German representatives about the treatment of prisoners of war. In the 1918 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Dame of the Order of the British Empire — prior to her 30th birthday. Livingstone, described as \\"a nominal Conservative\\", was appointed secretary of the National Referendum Committee on 11 April 1935. She later became Vice President of the United Nations Association. Livingstone authored The Peace Ballot: The Official History in 1935; although publisher Victor Gollancz was criticised for reportedly rushing to publish before the final votes had been tabulated. Correspondence regarding the above; including Trades Union Congress; subsequent National Peace Ballot, documents, reports, and memoranda are located in the Trades Union Congress archives. International Peace Campaign The International Peace Campaign emerged in early 1936, following the Peace Ballot organised in Britain by Dame Adelaide. Its Joint Presidents were Viscount Cecil (who inspired the campaign) and Pierre Cot, Air Minister in the French Popular Front government. The IPC aimed to co-ordinate the work of existing pacifist organisations and other groups opposed to war, and campaigned in support of the League of Nations on a policy of respect for treaty obligations, arms reduction and the peaceful resolution of conflict. After the outbreak of war, the campaign had difficulty sustaining its activities and was wound up in early 1941. References * Livingstone, (Dame) Adelaide, The Peace Ballot: The Official History.

It is named for the town of Martinsburg, West Virginia for which it was first described. It is the dominant rock formation of the Great Appalachian Valley in New Jersey (where it is called Kittatinny Valley and Pennsylvania (in the Lehigh Valley and Lebanon Valley). Description The Martinsburg is defined as a gray to dark gray, and infrequently tan and purple shale and slate. Local members of impure sandstone; thin, argillaceous limestone or phyllitic shale are present in the Cumberland Valley and the Lehigh Valley.Berg, T.M., Edmunds, W.E., Geyer, A.R. and others, compilers, (1980). Geologic Map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Map 1, scale 1:250,000. The Martinsburg has three defined members in the Lehigh Valley: The Bushkill Member which is defined as the basal slate unit. The Ramseyburg Member which is composed on alternating turbidite sandstone units with interbeds of shale and siltstone. The Pen Argyl Member, which is the uppermost slate unit with some minor phyllite and shale beds.Epstein, J.B., Sevon, W.D., Glaeser, J.D. (1974). Geology and the Mineral Resources of the Lehighton and Palmerton Quadrangles, Carbon and Northampton Counties, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, PA. A195c&d.; =Depositional environment= The shales (and slates) of the Martinsburg were deposited in a large forearc basin resulting in a flysch deposit. This basin was the result of a deepening sea due to the closing of the Iapetus Ocean. Turbidites are common in the Martinsburg due to underwater landslides stirring up sediments and rushing down a slope. Limestones were deposited upon peripheral bulges in the deep seas. A modern analog to the depositional history of the Martinsburg can be the Australia-East Timor tectonic setting.Diecchio, R.J., (1993). Stratigraphic Interpretation of the Ordovician of the Appalachian Basin and Implications for Taconian Flexural Modeling. Tectonics, Vol. 12 N. 6, p. 1410-1419. =Fossils= In the Pen Argyl Member, both Graptolites and Conodonts are found. The Trilobite Cryptolithus and the brittle star Protasterina are common the Swatara Gap area.Pennsylvania Geology. The Great Swatara Gap Fossil Migration. Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, PA. v 34, n 3. Age The Martinsburg was deposited during the Upper Ordovician period between 457 and 445 (±5) million years ago. Near Hamburg PA, an allochthonous klippe of rocks (known as the Hamburg klippe) is a tectonic slice of Middle Ordovician sediments placed within the Martinsburg. The Martinsburg lies above and below erosional unconformities. The Shawangunk Formation, Kittatinny Formation, Tuscarora Formation, and the Juniata Formation, all lie unconformably atop the Martinsburg. Below it, the Chambersburg Formations and Myerstown Formations lie on a possible unconformity.Berg, T.M., et al., (1983). Stratigraphic Correlation Chart of Pennsylvania: G75, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Economic uses Slate is still quarried out of the Martinsburg in the slate belt of Pennsylvania.

CheckInstall monitors the installation phase of a normal software build process and notes the files that are added to the system. It then builds a package that contains these files, using additional information gathered from the user. Finally, the files installed by the original run are removed and the package is installed using the system package tools, so the package will be properly registered in the local installed packages database. The primary benefits provided by CheckInstall versus simply running \`make install\` are the ability to remove the package from the system using the system packaging tools, and the ability to install the resulting package on multiple machines.

The Institute develops and uses innovative technology for research in space, focusing on astrophysical research, Earth science and planetary research. SRON has a line of research into new and more sensitive sensors for X-rays and infrared radiation. SRON was founded in 1983 under the former names Stichting Ruimteonderzoek Nederland / Space Research Organisation Netherlands. SRON is part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and has facilities in Utrecht and in Groningen. Science and technology The institute has over 250 staff who are employed at a support department and five divisions: High-Energy Astrophysics (HEA), Low-Energy Astrophysics (LEA), Earth and Planetary Science (EPS), Sensor Research and Technology (SR&T;) and Engineering Division (ED). Technology SRON's ambition is to act as leading institute in the development of state-of-the-art satellite instruments for space research missions of ESA, NASA and other agencies. Through the years SRON technology has contributed to many ground-breaking space missions, mainly dedicated to mapping the infrared sky (e.g. IRAS, ISO, HIFI/Herschel), analyzing X-ray and gamma ray sources (e.g. CGRO/COMPTEL, Beppo-SAX, Chandra, XMM-Newton) and studying the Earth atmosphere (SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT). Examples of future missions to which SRON will contribute are SPICA (infrared), ASTRO-H (X-ray) and Sentinel 5 Precursor (Earth atmosphere). The institute is also planning contributions to missions which will study other planets in the Solar System and beyond.

The ring-type structure is the SiN suspension, intended to produce a very weak coupling to the heat bath and thus a sensitive detector. In various wavelength areas SRON's sensors are already some of the most sensitive in the world. However, SRON is continuously looking for new ways to deploy even more sensitive sensors for the improved detection of cosmic radiation or for measurements of the atmosphere of the Earth and other planets. This requires long-term investments in the development of new sensors, electronics and specialist techniques. In the near future detectors shall increasingly take the shape of large chips with many megapixels, with a unique combination of two dimensional pictures and spectroscopy color resolving power. These detectors require the development of new advanced electronics, smart control software, extreme cooling techniques and novel materials. SRON develops a new generation of detectors, and the necessary read-out and control electronics, for international missions in the submillimeter and far-infrared areas. For example, such extremely sensitive detectors are needed in SPICA/ SAFARI so that we can learn more about protoplanetary discs and the formation of planets. For SPICA/ SAFARI SRON is currently working on Transition Edge Sensors (TES). National and international partners Customers are on the one hand the international organizations with which SRON cooperates in bilateral, European or global projects. On the other hand, there is science as the customer: scientists from the Universities in Utrecht, Groningen and Leiden, and outside the Dutch borders for example with DLR.

Geography Debel occupies several hills with elevation ranging from 560 to 650 meters above sea level. The main agricultural products of Debel are olives and tobacco. Demography The people of Debel are Lebanese and are almost exclusively Maronites Christians. History In 1596 it was named as a village, ‘“Dibil” in the Ottoman nahiya (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the liwa' (district) of Safad, with a population of 12 households and 6 bachelors, all Maronite Christina. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, summer crops, fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to \\"occasional revenues”; a total of 1,530 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 184Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that Hütteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1852 Edward Robinson noted the village (\\"Dibl\\") on his travels in the region.Robinson and Smith, 1856, p. 62 Ernest Renan visited the area during his mission to Lebanon and described what he found in his book Mission de Phénicie (1865-1874). At Dibl he found Greek Inscriptions.Renan, 1864, pp. 674-5 In 1875 Victor Guérin visited, and described it as a village with 400 Maronite inhabitants. He also found here several inscriptions in Greek.Guérin, 1880, p. 115 He further noted: \\"At this village there are some rock-cut tombs, in one of which there is an inscription. Many well-dressed stones are used, and turn up in digging. On one of these was a fragmentary inscription. Under some of the houses of the village there is a large piece of tesselated pavement of very good design. The colours are red, black, and white. There are some sarcophagi and some broken pillars. This was probably an early Christian site.\\"Guérin, 1880, pp. 115-116; as translated by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 221-222 In 1881 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Dibl: \\"A village, built of stone, containing about 500 Christians (Guerin says 400 Maronites) ; there is a Maronite chapel.

Owned by Crawford Broadcasting, the station has an inspirational format.https://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/171490/crawford-broadcasting-adds-wmuz-a-the-salt-detroit The station's studios and offices are located near Burt Road and Capitol Avenue in the Weatherby section of Detroit, while its transmitter is in Romulus. WMUZ is a Class B station operating on the clear-channel frequency of 1200 AM; WOAI in San Antonio, Texas is the dominant Class A station on 1200 AM. WMUZ uses a four-tower array during daylight hours and a ten-tower array during nighttime hours. History =AM 1440 WCHB= The WCHB call letters date back to 1956, when the station signed on as a 1,000-watt daytimer at 1440 on the AM dial licensed to Inkster, Michigan. The call letters stood for Dr. Wendell Cox and Dr. Haley Bell, who owned and operated the station under the Bell Broadcasting banner. WCHB was one of the earliest radio station in the United States to be built from the ground up by black owners, and with an R&B; format, quickly became a visible presence in Detroit's black community. Early on, WCHB aimed to be an all-purpose full-service station for Detroit's African-American community, featuring not only R&B; hits, but also gospel music, jazz, talk shows, and even a \\"Tweeny Time\\" show for two-to-six-year- olds. By the late 1960s, however, the popularity of the Motown sound, in addition to competition from WJLB (then an AM station at 1400 on the dial, now WDTK) and FM upstart WGPR, led WCHB to adopt a more Top 40-style presentation to the soul format. Locally owned for many years by Bell Broadcasting, WCHB signed on an FM sister, 105.9 WCHD, in 1960, which later changed its calls to WJZZ and became Detroit's most popular jazz station. 105.9 is still co-owned with the AM station by Radio One as WDMK. WCHB experimented with a disco-based format for a time during the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, WCHB saw its ratings sink during the 1980s as FM urban contemporary stations like WJLB (which moved its format from the AM to the FM dial in 1980) and WDRQ grabbed much of its audience. The station eventually returned to its roots of being a full-service voice for the African-American community. =AM 1200 WCHB= The WCHB calls moved to their current home at 1200 kHz in February 1990 as a new AM station for the Metro Detroit areahttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- YB/Broadcasting-1989-Yearbook-Page-Range-Guide.htm and owned by Bell Broadcasting. AM 1440 moved into a gospel format as WMKM. In 1998, Bell Broadcasting sold WCHB and WCHB-FM (formerly WJZZ, later WDTJ and now WDMK) to Radio One. Radio One then set about the process of upgrading WCHB's signal, which involved taking the station off the air for several months in August 1998 to upgrade the equipment and purchasing WKNX in Frankenmuth (at 1210 AM) and moving it to Kingsley, near Traverse City in northern Michigan (see also WLDR and WJML), to allow the 1200 AM signal to upgrade. Another occurrence which played a role was the nighttime reduction in power of first-adjacent channel WOWO in Ft. Wayne, Indiana (at 1190 AM). WOWO also directionalized its nighttime signal towards the west and became a Class B station (formerly a Class A, clear channel with good nighttime coverage of Metro Detroit). That change of the WOWO signal at least partially allowed WCHB to increase nighttime power to 15,000 watts from 700 watts. WCHB resurfaced in March 1999 with a new 50,000-watt daytime/15,000-watt nighttime signal and with a format of mainly gospel music, with a morning talk show, \\"Inside Detroit,\\" hosted by outspoken Detroit personality and former WJLB newscaster Mildred Gaddis. =NewsTalk 1200 WCHB= In April 2005, WCHB cut back its gospel programming to 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. weekdays and around the clock on weekends to make way for Radio One's syndicated lineup. Beginning on January 30, 2006, Radio One debuted Syndication One, a joint venture of Radio One and REACH Media which featured urban talk show hosts Reverend Al Sharpton, Michael Eric Dyson and Doug & Ryan Stewart - the 2 Live Stews sports show. Mildred Gaddis' \\"Inside Detroit\\" remains a part of the schedule and airs from 6-10 a.m. weekdays. Another local show, \\"Your Voice with Angelo Henderson,\\" hosted by Wall Street Journal columnist Angelo Henderson also airs weekdays from 10 a.m.-1 p.m. The shows were also simultaneously placed on other Radio One stations, including WILD 1090 in Boston, WOL 1450 in Washington, DC., WVCG 1080 in Miami, WERE 1300 in Cleveland and WROU 1240 in Richmond, Virginia. Cox Radio's Birmingham station, WPSB 1320, also picked up each of the shows. In March 2007, Michael Eric Dyson left the show and Syndication One. He was replaced by The Warren Ballentine Show, hosted by attorney Warren Ballentine, who refers himself as The People's Attorney and radio Truth Fighter. On April 30, 2007, WCHB welcomed Parker & the Man to the weekly line-up. The show, hosted by sports journalist Rob Parker and broadcaster Mark Wilson. Parker is a columnist for the Detroit News and a regular contributor on ESPN2's First Take. Wilson is a former Associated Press and Michigan Association of Broadcasters' \\"Michigan Sportscaster of the Year.\\" Parker & the Man, who were previously heard on Detroit FM station Live 97.1 WKRK, initially ran from 9 p.m-12 a.m. They were consistently among the top shows with men 25-54 while at WKRK, which is now known as 97.1 The Ticket. In the fall of 2007, after the 2 Live Stews syndication deal was not renewed by Syndication One, Parker & the Man shifted to 4-7 p.m. In June 2008, Parker and The Man was dropped from the station. =Gospel goes full time on AM 1200= On June 9, 2008, at 10 a.m., News-Talk AM 1200 flipped formats to a full-time gospel music station. Of its News-talk line-up, only morning host Mildred Gaddis remained with the station, continuing her morning drive show. She was the only live host on the station; after her show, the station became automated. WCHB was known as AM 1200 WCHB, Mildred In The Morning and Inspiration All Day. =Return of NewsTalk 1200= In 2009, WCHB reimaged itself as a News/Talk station again after failing to attract listeners with its Gospel format (the format was later relaunched in October 2011, this time on sister station WHTD). Gaddis remained in mornings, followed by Henderson, the syndicated Shapton, Ramona Prater's \\"F Club Radio Show\\" (a program geared towards a female audience), and Gayle King. Both Gaddis and Sharpton's shows are repeated after 8PM on weekdays. On October 15, 2011, WCHB moved an FM repeater station, W206BI, from 89.1 to 99.9 FM (becoming W260CB) and began testing on that frequency. W206BI/W260CB was a translator of Toledo's National Public Radio affiliate, WGTE-FM, owned by the Bell Broadcasting Company (owned by Haley Bell, former co-owner of WCHB), and licensed to Hamtramck at 89.1 FM, with an application to move up to 99.9 and repeat WDMK-FM. W260CB is now on the air permanently; technically, the station repeats WDMK-HD2 105.9 FM, which was a slightly delayed simulcast of WCHB.http://www.hdradio.com/stations W260CB broadcasts with a power of 250 watts and an antenna of 245 meters. During the summer of 2012, WCHB added smooth jazz programming during the late evening and overnight hours, restoring the format to the Detroit area on a part-time basis. Programming is from Broadcast Architecture's Smooth Jazz Network. On April 12, 2017, Radio One announced that WCHB would be sold to Crawford Broadcasting.http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20170412/NEWS/170419940/radio- one-detroit-oks-deal-to-sell- wchbhttp://www.insideradio.com/features/deal_digest/deal-digest--- august/article_d94fc146-7d81-11e7-894e-3302af2afddc.html At the same time, the company also stated that much of WCHB's programming will move to WPZR.http://www.urbanradionation.com/2017/04/radio-one-sells-detroit- heritage.html Mildred Gaddis moves to the FM dial Also with the sale, translator W260CB was retained by Radio One, and currently simulcasts WDMK's HD2 sub-channel airing a classic soul format as \\"Soul 99.9.\\" As of June 23, 2017, the music portion of WCHB's programming consists of Motown and classic soul music. On August 3, 2017, WCHB went silent after the sale of the station to Crawford was completed. On October 1, 2017, WCHB changed their call letters to WMUZ (the WCHB calls were moved to 1340 AM, formerly WEXL). According to a Crawford Broadcasting engineering newsletter, WCHB is undergoing upgrades and will return to the air November 1, 2017.https://crawfordbroadcasting.com/Local_Oscillator/August%202017%20Local%20Oscillator.pdf Oscillator Pages 1 & 2https://crawfordbroadcasting.com/Local_Oscillator/September%202017%20Local%20Oscillator.pdf Oscillator Page 4https://crawfordbroadcasting.com/Local_Oscillator/November%202017%20Local%20Oscillator.pdf Oscillator Pages 1 & 2https://crawfordbroadcasting.com/Local_Oscillator/October%202017%20Local%20Oscillator.pdf Oscillator Pages 5 & 6 Previous Logo 200px See also *Media in Detroit References External links *Official website *WMUZ The Salt 1200 AM Facebook *WCHB website *Rev.

He can climb trees with ease and slide down to hunt the birds on whom he feeds and dominates with the hypnotic power of his antennas. Because of this he is called \\"the lord of the air\\". Moñái is fond of stealing and hiding the products of his misdeeds in a cave. His continuous robbing and raiding in the villages provoked great discord among the people as they all accuse each other for the robberies and mysterious \\"disappearances\\" of their belongings. The townspeople joined to put an end to Moñái's misdeeds and those of his brothers. The beautiful Porâsý offered herself to carry out this mission. She convinced Moñái that she had fallen in love with him and that before they celebrated their wedding she wanted to meet his brothers. Moñái left her in the care of Teju Jagua and left to search for the rest of his brothers: Mbói Tu'i, Yasy Yateré, Kurupí, Luisón, and Ao Ao. When he finally brought them all they began the wedding rituals. The brothers exchanged the drinks freely and quickly became completely drunk. It was in this moment that Porâsý attempted to escape from the cave which was closed off by a huge stone. Moñái prevented her from leaving and threw her back into the cave. Porâsý screamed to alarm the people who were waiting outside. Knowing that she was lost she ordered the people to burn the cave, even with her inside. While this killed Porasy herself, it also successfully destroyed Tau and Kerana's cursed descendants, including Moñai himself. In return for the sacrifice of Porâsý, the gods lifted her soul and changed it into a small but intense point of light. Since then, the gods destined the spirit of Porasy to light up the aurora.

Much of this territory is sparsely inhabited and is home to wide open, scenic vistas. While it does not pass through any large cities or towns, it does pass through Window Rock, seat of government for the Navajo Nation, as well as near Old Oraibi, which is generally considered the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in North America. History The route from Tuba City to Window Rock existed as a dirt road as early as 1927. By 1935, portions of the route had been improved. The section between Oraibi and Keams Canyon and the section from northwest of Ganado and the New Mexico border had been improved for travel. By 1938, the route had been improved further to a gravel road. By 1956, a large gap in the road was completed through Hah-Hoh-No-Geh Canyon, just southeast of Tuba City. In previous years, this gap had made the driving the road between Hotevilla and Tuba City impossible. About of the Tuba City to Window Rock road was added to the state highway system as Arizona State Route 264 (SR 264) on July 26. 1960. This section began southeast of Tuba City and ended at a junction with SR 64 in Tuba City proper. By 1961, SR 264 from the SR 64 junction to a point southeast of Tuba City had been paved. Later that year, SR 264 was extended east to the New Mexico border, ending at the beginning of New Mexico State Road 68 (NM 68). Today, NM 68 is known as NM 264, continuing the Route 264 designation east to U.S. Route 491 (US 491) in Yah-ta-hey, New Mexico.

Poor visibility in heavy fog can bring on the condition as well as psychological factors such as fear of heights or fear of mountains. High speed and falling may also contribute as when descending rapidly atmospheric pressure changes in the ear from high to low altitude. Symptoms are similar to other sicknesses brought about by motion and include: dizziness, headaches and nausea and in more extreme cases vomiting. In whiteout conditions, the brain is unable to determine orientation or movement accurately. The condition is caused by the rhythmic turning motion of skiing and other effects such as a reduction in sensory feedback from constrained feet. In 1995 Rudolf Häusler of the University of Berne was the first described to suffer from this disease. \\"Ski Sickness\\", Acta Otolaryngol (Stockh) 1995; 115: 1-2, 1995 Scandinavian University Press Ski sickness could affect up to 10% of skiers.

Geography Yaroun occupies a hill with elevation ranging from 750 to 900 meters above sea level. The main agricultural products of Yaroun are olives, wheat, and tobacco. Yaroun lies on the border with Israel. It overlooks Saliha and Kafr Bir'im in the Israeli part of the border. History In 1596, it was named as a village, Yarun an-Nasara, in the Ottoman nahiya (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the liwa' (district) of Safad, with a population of 37 Muslim households and 20 Muslim bachelors, and 39 Christian households and 11 Christian bachelors. The villagers paid taxes on a number of crops, such as wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to \\"occasional revenues\\"; a total of 7,247 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 179.Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that Hütteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1674, western travellers saw remains of a monastery and church near by, with fragments from many columns.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 371 In 1781 Nasif al-Nassar was killed here by Jazzar Pasha when their two armies met.Blanford, 2011, pp. 12-13 In 1838, Edward Robinson noted it as \\"a large village\\".

He found many antiquities at Yaroun.Renan, 1864, pp. 680-2 On 31 December 1863, Louis Félicien de Saulcy, the French orientalist and archaeologist left Jish and arrived in Yaroun, and despite the heavy rain on that day, he examined the ruins of a temple, with a huge sarcophagi and sepulchral excavations cut into the rock, and a square well few meters deep, deducing that Yaroun was the Biblical town of Iaraoun, one of the cities of the Nephatli tribe mentioned in the Book of Joshua (xiv. 38)Saulcy de, Louis Félicien, Voyage en Terre Sainte, Volume 2, Nabu Press (April 1, 2010), pages 275-276. In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it: “A stone village, containing about 200 Metawileh and 200 Christians ; a Christian chapel in the village. The village is situated on the edge of a plain, with vineyards and arable land; to the west rises a basalt-top called el Burj, full of cisterns, and supposed to be the site of an ancient castle ; there are large stones strewn about ; there are three large birkets and many cisterns to supply water; one of the birkets is ruined.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 203 SWP also found here the remains of an ancient Church, with Greek inscriptions.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 258-260 By the 1945 statistics the population was counted with Saliha and Maroun al-Ras, and totalled 1070 MuslimsDepartment of Statistics, 1945, p. 11 with 11,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Many wars happened in South Area of Lebanon and the economic development is weak therefore many young Yarounis choose to relocate to Beirut to continue their higher educations because of the lack of universities in the South and after that they choose to emigrate to the USA, Canada or Europe and some of them settle in the Gulf, and they visit their families back in Yaroun to keep ties with their relatives and bear in mind that immigrants have an Economic Impact on their families (Money Transfers or Allowances), and this will help their Families to pay their expenses and to let them stay in Yaroun.

History With the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1882, Moosomin was established as the first Saskatchewan community on \\"steel\\". Originally known as \\"siding No. 4\\" and the \\"Moosomin Station\\", businesses began to establish and by 1884 the community had grown to include five general stores, five hotels, two livery stables, two blacksmiths, a doctor, a lawyer, butcher, and one printer, among other businesses. Moosomin was incorporated as a town in November 1887. R. D. McNaughton was the first merchant to arrive in Moosomin. He founded the R. D. McNaughton Company, a general store operation that played a vital role in early settlement. The town was named after Chief Moosomin, who became well known for leading his band into treaty status. He signed Treaty 6 at Battleford in 1880. The first issue of the Moosomin Courier weekly newspaper was published on Thursday, October 2, 1884. The newspaper has been published weekly since 1884 and is now known as the World-Spectator. It is the oldest community newspaper in the province. Moosomin had several military units that were associated with the community. These included the 16th Light Horse, in the early 1900s (decade); 10th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles, 1915; 217th Battalion, CEF, and the 101st Battery of the 22nd Field Regiment which was based at Moosomin Armories (presently the Community Hall). Moosomin also had a jail, the Moosomin Gaol, which is located at the site of the present day Turpie Farm. In 1905, a hospital opened, and it was the only hospital between Brandon and Indian Head. A normal school was opened, and before this time it served as the home of the Legislative Assembly for the District of Assiniboia. The first issue of the local newspaper was published October 2, 1884, and the Moosomin World-Spectator is the oldest weekly newspaper in Saskatchewan. One of Moosomin's more notables is General Andrew McNaughton, born in Moosomin in 1887. In the Second World War, he commanded Canada's overseas army and then became Minister of Defence. In the interwar years he was Chairman of the National Research Council and following the Second World War was Chairman of the International Joint Commission which handled questions pertaining to the international waters along the Canada- United States border. The social life of the early settlers of the area was limited by distances and transportation methods. Sunday church services were often held in private homes. The small one room school houses became the centre of activity in most areas. Saturday nights were often the social night of the week, when groceries and supplies were purchased. There was often entertainment in the Opera House in the R.D. McNaughton Store. Summer picnics were held in the period between summerfallowing and haying. July 1 in Moosomin was the highlight of the summer for many years, there would be a parade, sports events and refreshments. With the arrival of the automobile, social life changed accordingly. Current development Moosomin grew significantly in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the construction of a major potash mine to the north. Moosomin is currently undergoing significant growth. According to Saskatchewan Health, which tracks population based on the number of health cards issued, there were 2,733 people living in Moosomin on June 30, 2010, up from 2,496 a year earlier, an increase of 227 people. The growth is due to several reasons. The PotashCorp Rocanville potash mine just north of the community is undergoing a $2.8 billion expansion, the $60 million Red Lily Wind Farm just west of the community started producing power in February 2011, since the Trans-Canada Highway was twinned through Moosomin in November 2009 several new businesses have been established along the highway, the Southeast Integrated Care Centre has become a major health care centre for a large region of southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba, and there has been significant activity in the local oil patch, which is at the northern end of the Bakken Formation. Several major projects are on the drawing board in Moosomin. Land has been purchased for two major hotel developments next to the Canalta Hotel, which opened in 2010 facing the new highway, and land has been purchased for Pipestone Villas, a major residential development.

Originally built in 1928 as SS Dixie at the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Kearny, New Jersey, she was formally acquired by the United States Navy on 3 March 1941 from the Southern Pacific Steamship lines (Morgan Line) and converted for naval service at the Bethlehem Steel Key Highway Plant in Baltimore, Maryland. The vessel was commissioned as USS Alcor (AG-34) on 4 September 1941 with Commander Edward A. Mitchell in command. Service history The ship got underway on 7 December to sail to Casco Bay, Maine. After completing shakedown training, she shaped a course for Norfolk, Virginia and, upon reaching that port on 19 December, became the flagship of Commander, Train, Atlantic Fleet. Re-classified a repair ship and redesignated AR-10 on 22 December 1941 Alcor began a tour of duty at Norfolk (repairing damage and making alterations to warships) that lasted for more than 30 months. Her protracted sojourn at Norfolk came to an end on 4 July 1944 when the repair ship got underway for the New England coast. She reached Casco Bay on 14 July and became the flagship of Commander, Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet. She remained in Casco Bay for the next five months making repairs for various ships of the fleet. While carrying out this assignment, her designation was changed to AD-34 on 6 November 1944. In early January, 1945 the destroyer tender left the east coast, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal and joined the Pacific Fleet on 16 January. Alcor continued on to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 3 February. She provided tender services there until 4 June, when she sailed for the Philippine Islands. While en route, the vessel was diverted to Eniwetok. After a four-day layover for a special construction project, the tender resumed her original course and arrived at Leyte on 26 June. There, she reported to Service Squadron 10 for duty and began repair work for various ships. During Alcor's service in the Philippines, Japan capitulated on 15 August 1945. Alcor left Philippine waters on 14 September and headed for Okinawa. She reached Buckner Bay on the 18th and resumed her tender duties. She sailed for Japan on 28 February 1946. Her first stop was at Sasebo, where she carried out repair work through late March. Alcor then moved her operations to Yokosuka. The tender finished her tour there on 8 May, then shaped a course for the United States. After a pause en route at Pearl Harbor, the ship reached San Diego on 3 June. She sailed back through the Panama Canal and reached Norfolk on 22 June. Preparations were begun for her deactivation, and Alcor was decommissioned on 5 August 1946. The vessel was sold on 6 August 1946. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 August 1946; she was later scrapped in 1950.

He also served in leadership roles in a variety of historical and archival societies, including the American Council of Learned Societies, Society of American Archivists, National Park Service, and the FDR Library. Early life Leland was born in Massachusetts, the son of public school teachers Luther Erving Leland and Ellen Gifford. After graduating from Newton High School in 1896, Leland went to Brown University, earning a B.A. In 1900 he enrolled at Harvard University, earning his M.S. in history in 1901. In 1904 Leland married Gertrude Dennis, a Canadian-born violinist. Carnegie Institution and American Historical Association In 1903 Harvard professor Albert Bushnell Hart offered Leland, then a teaching assistant, the opportunity to assist Claude H. Van Tyne in a survey sponsored by the newly founded Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. A 6-month temporary assignment was the beginning of Leland's 24-year association with the institution. The Guide to the Archives of the Government of the United States in Washington (1904), coauthored by Leland and Van Tyne, was followed in 1907 by an edition revised and expanded by Leland, which established Leland as the nation's leading authority on federal archives. During this time Leland joined the American Historical Association (AHA) and served as the secretary in 1909-1920, working closely with J. Franklin Jameson to lobby Congress to establish a National Archive. National and international archival work After completing the Guide, Leland's next assignment from the Carnegie Institution was to travel to repositories throughout the eastern United States to collect letters of Continental Congress delegates. He then began work on his multi-volume Guide to Materials for American History in the Libraries and Archives of Paris. In 1907-1914 and 1922-1927 he served as the Carnegie Institution's principal representative in France. Two volumes, on libraries and on the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were published in 1932 and 1943. Drafts for an additional three volumes are among the Leland Papers, archived at the Library of Congress. In an associated activity, he directed the foreign copying program of the Library of Congress for French manuscripts relating to the United States. He also initiated work on what became the institution's 2-volume Calendar of Manuscripts in Paris Archives and Libraries Relating to the History of the Mississippi Valley to 1803. In his best-known archival-related activity he worked with J. Franklin Jameson to provide documentation for the campaign to establish the National Archives. In 1926 Congress voted funds for the building's construction, and it finally opened in 1934. Leland's influence on archival affairs, however, transcended his efforts on behalf of the National Archives. He conceived the first Conference of Archivists in the United States, which met at Columbia University in conjunction with the American Historical Association's 1909 Annual Meeting. He took this opportunity to introduce Americans to a variety of European concepts that soon became institutionalized as standard best practices in the United States and formed the basis for archival theory. His address at the 1909 conference on \\"American Archival Problems\\" remains a classic in the archival literature. Leland led a delegation of Americans to the First International Congress of Archivists and Librarians in Brussels in 1910, a meeting that set the stage for the growing global interchange of archival theories and concepts. He attended classes in Archive Economy at the Ecole des Chartres in 1913-1914, and continued to use American Historical Association gatherings as a venue to introduce such principles as provenance and original order to American audiences. Although he had moved away from direct participation in archival affairs by the 1920s, the Society of American Archivists recognized his contribution by electing him its second president in 1939. His two presidential addresses on \\"The Archivist in Times of Emergency\\" and \\"Historians and Archivists in the First World War\\" set an important scholarly tone for the fledgling professional association. Founding member and leader of ACLS and ICHS In 1923 the International Congress of Historical Sciences (ICHS) appointed a committee that, under Leland's guidance, led to the formation in 1926 of the International Committee of Historical Sciences. Leland initially served as the new group's treasurer and in 1938 became its president, a position he held for 10 years. During much of that period he also served as president of the Union Académique International (UAI). In 1919 Leland acted as organizing secretary for a meeting of representatives from leading American scholarly societies in the social sciences and the humanities that led to the formation of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), a step taken to create an American organization eligible for membership in the newly reorganized UAI. In 1927 the ACLS received a major grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, enabling it to secure the services of a full-time administrative officer. Leland left the Carnegie Institution to take the position. Leland served as ACLS secretary in 1927 to 1939 and as director from 1939 until his retirement in 1946. As the ACLS representative in the negotiation of the “1935 Gentleman’s Agreement for Fair Use in Education”, \\"Research Libraries and Fair Use\\", p.5, 12-13, Peter B. Hirtle, Intellectual Property Officer, Cornell University Library Leland was heavily involved in the first official policy statement concerning the use of copyrighted materials by researchers. Leland oversaw both the ACLS's international cooperative activities and its domestic programs, including publication of The Dictionary of American Biography (1927-1936) and the annual Handbook of Latin American Studies, begun in 1935. Through Leland's efforts, the ACLS distributed money to individual scholars to support research and publications. Also, through fellowships and the sponsorship of scholarly conferences, the ACLS was able to encourage the development of area studies in the United States for Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Iranian, Slavic, Near Eastern, and Latin American culture and civilization. Work in UNESCO, FDR Library, and National Park Service During the interwar years Leland worked with the League of Nations and served as a delegate to the 1945 London Conference that led to the establishment of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and to the 1948 UNESCO General Conference in Beirut. In 1946-1949 he served as vice-chairman (under Milton Eisenhower) of the United States National Commission for UNESCO. He also served two terms during this period as president of the Society of American Archivists. After his retirement from the ACLS in 1946, Leland became active in the promotion and development of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library, testifying before Congress, giving speeches, and working with architects and designers. He served as chair of the Executive Committee of the FDR Library Foundation in 1946-1952.FDR Library Archives Leland became chairman of the Advisory Board of the National Park Service in 1935 and remained in that position until the 1950s. The board had a strong influence in the development and management of the NPS. It not only advised the United States Secretary of the Interior and the NPS director on policy, but it evaluated new areas proposed for addition to the system. It developed policy guidelines on matters related to historical sites and buildings and embraced the development and safeguarding of all parks in the system. Congress passed an act in 1955 addressing the role of the NPS with regard to historic properties. There was particular concern that the integration of historic sites and buildings into the NPS, which had been authorized earlier in the 1950s, be appropriate. The act was stimulated by discussion over the Rockefeller family's development of Williamsburg, Virginia. A commission under Leland's direction was sent to Europe to study the mechanisms for historical preservation used there. Waldo Leland died on October 19, 1966 at age 87. Awards, prizes, and memorials Among the honors he received were honorary degrees conferred by Brown University in 1929, the University of Rochester in 1939, Northwestern University in 1944, the University of Colorado in 1943, and the University of North Carolina in 1946.Though in later life he would often be addressed as Dr. Leland, all his doctorates were honorary.

They formed in 2002. Band history Citizens Here and Abroad was formed in 2002 when Adrienne Robillard and Dan Lowrie, following the breakup of their previous band Secadora, happened to move into an apartment across the street from Dealership drummer Chris Wetherell. Neighborly talking led to musical collaboration. Taking their name from a 1953 Girl Scout manual discovered on a bookshelf at a boozy Oakland house party, the trio cemented their lineup with Dealership bass player/vocalist Chris Groves. Their sound has been described as dreamy and cerebral. While their songs are built on catchy melodies, they don't tend to follow traditional verse-chorus-verse song structure, opting for a more experimental approach to composition.[] In 2004, their debut album, Ghosts of Tables and Chairs was released on Omnibus Records. The band toured the US and the UK in support of the album, and the track Appearances ended up being used in the U.S. television teen soap opera, The O.C. Their follow-up album, Waving, Not Drowning (see Not Waving but Drowning) was released in 2006 on Turn Records.

Common names for the genus include star-grass, star lily, yellow stars, African potato, and stars.Hypoxis. FloraBase. Western Australian Herbarium. The genus is the largest of the Hypoxidaceae and has its centre of variation in South Africa, where it occurs in open undisturbed grasslands. The name Hypoxis was taken over by Linnaeus in 1759 from a name coined by Paul Reneaulme in 1611 for a superficially similar species of Gagea and meaning \\"a little sour\\", referring to the taste of that plant's leaves.Paul Reneaulme. Specimen Historiae Plantarum. 1611. page 92 Description These plants are perennial herbs with corms or rhizomes. Some have tubers. The aboveground herbage is a layered cluster of lance-shaped, linear, or hairlike leaves, sometimes sheathed together at the bases. The blades are usually at least slightly hairy. The flowers are borne on a short, stemlike scape in a raceme or umbel arrangement, or sometimes singly. The flower has six yellow tepals which may be hairy, especially on the undersides. The undersides may also be whitish or tinged green or red. Occasional flowers have 4 or 8 tepals. The fruit is a capsule with a few to many small, oily seeds. The seeds are needed to identify many species. Most have seeds less than 2 millimeters long, so microscopic examination is required. Uses Hypoxis plants have long played a role in traditional African medicine; H. hemerocallidea and H. colchicifolia are the best known species used to make medicine and teas. The genus is not only used in traditional medicine, it has become important also in pharmaceutical preparations. Archaeological evidence found in ashes in Border Cave, South Africa has revealed that early humans roasted the rhizomes of some of the more palatable species of Hypoxis as long as 170,000 years ago.

The settlement was founded in 1901 as a Quaker retreat by a group of Friends from Philadelphia, including Charles F. Jenkins who became and remained the president of the Buck Hill Falls Company until his death in 1951. The Inn at Buck Hill Falls, originally a small wooden hostelry, expanded ultimately to a large new stone building in 1926 and enjoyed popularity into the 1970s and 1980s. By the time of its closure, the Inn had over 400 guest rooms along with resort amenities, including an indoor swimming pool with a retractable glass roof, several lobby spaces, and a white linen dining room where guests were feted with fine food while occasionally enjoying live harpsichord music. Another feature of the Inn was the north porch, a huge covered stone structure with views of the surrounding Pocono mountains. Guests could take afternoon tea and relax in rocking chairs looking out over the mountains. However, changes in ownership, financial troubles, and several fires led to the closing of the Inn in October 1990. Although there was no single cause of the Inn's failure, the decline in the costs of air travel, allowing vacationers from New York and Philadelphia to avoid the long drive into the Poconos was certainly a major factor in its demise. The Inn property was bought recently. At Buck Hill Falls Rexford Tugwell, while in charge of the New Deal's Resettlement Administration, conducted a June 1935 conference on the future of housing and resettlement. Stuart Taylor also attended, as did Eleanor Roosevelt, who considered herself to be an observer. \\"You cannot just build houses and tell people to go and live in them. They must be taught how to live,\\" said Mrs. Roosevelt. There is still an active community of both summer and year-round residents, many of whom come for a summer retreat from New York City or Philadelphia. Many families have been coming to Buck Hill for generations. The community still has the amenities of its past as a popular Quaker resort, including a 27-hole Donald Ross-designed golf course, 10 tennis courts, and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. The nearby villages of Mountainhome and Canadensis provide places to shop. Buck Hill Falls is known for its natural environment including its namesake waterfall, the annual Buck Hill Art Association Art Show, and the Foxhowe Association, which sponsors lectures and oversees the Friends meeting for worship in the summer. The Buck Hill Lawn Bowling Association has also hosted National Finals several times. Also, the Buck Hill Conservation Foundation is actively buying easements, and maintaining expansive trails throughout the of forest surrounding the settlement. Most recently, Buck Hill Falls (in partnership with neighboring Skytop, PA) became the home of the Buck Hill-Skytop Music Festival, the Poconos' premier classical music venue, featuring Opera, Chamber Music, and Jazz. In 2000, the Buck Hill Inn was used as a location for MTV's Fear, and several liberties were taken with its history, including claiming that Buck Hill Falls was the site of 73 murders, the suicide of one maid, and one room being built on ley lines, as well as ghost sightings. Obviously, none of this has been proven to be true, yet the Inn still has rumors of being haunted from the local residents. In July 2003, The Buck Hill Inn was reported on fire due to arson. Two men were arrested and were both charged with arson, trespassing, burglary, criminal mischief, risking catastrophe, and other offenses. The two men started three fires in the Inn's Library, the main lobby, and a recreational building on the property that spread to a nearby annex. Because of the damage done to the historical Buck Hill Inn, there was great debate whether to demolish the building, or to restore it completely. The Inn was demolished in 2016. http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030711/NEWS/307119998&cid;=sitesearch References External links * Buck Hill Falls Website * Barrett Township Community Portal Category:Unincorporated communities in Pennsylvania Category:Populated places established in 1901 Category:Pocono Mountains Category:Waterfalls of Pennsylvania ","title":"Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"9814704","text":"Denis Tunnicliffe, Baron Tunnicliffe, (born 17 January 1943) is a British pilot and railwayman.

Only around 25 were built; it was quickly superseded by the FAI armoured car. Both were assembled in the Izhorsky Factory near Leningrad. Design As a result of their extensive experience with armored cars during the Civil War, the Soviets showed a great deal of interest in developing more modern versions during the 1930s.Zaloga, Steven \\"Soviet Tanks and Combat Vehicles of World War II\\", Weidenfeld & Nicolson Military, (1984) However, their initial efforts were slowed until the rejuvenation of the Russian automobile industry which began in the late 1920s. The Soviets saw the armored car as falling into two primary classes; light and heavy. This classification was based more on armament than on weight. Light armored cars were armed with machine guns while heavy armored cars were armed with tank guns. The earlier armored car designs, such as the BA-27, were based on a truck chassis. Following the BA-27 project, the next projects were undertaken at the Izhorskiye Factory in Kolpino on the basis of newly imported Ford Model A automobiles, and their Soviet copies, the GAZ-A. The chassis for most armored cars of the 1930s were built by the KIM plant in Moscow and the Gorkiy plant in Nizhny Novgorod. The latter plant was originally known as the Nizhny Novgorod Automobile plant (NAZ), but was renamed as the Gorkiy Automobile Plant (GAZ) in the mid-1930s. These chassis were shipped to the armored car manufacturers (primarily the Izhorskiy and the smaller but longer established Vyksinskiy plant), where the armored bodies were mounted on the chassis and final assembly was undertaken. Prior to 1931, the imported Ford Timken chassis was used for some Soviet armored cars. While this chassis was available thereafter, the provision of series production technology to the USSR by Henry Ford in 1931-32 gave a major boost to Soviet armored car production. It provided readymade chassis for both light (Ford/GAZ-A and Ford/GAZ-AA-based) and heavy (GAZ-AAA-based) armored cars. ZiS was also later to provide 6×4 chassis for limited production heavy armored cars. The D-8 Armored vehicle, designed in 1931 by N. I. Dyrenkov, was relatively light and had no turret. The design utilized a licensed passenger car Ford A chassis. Two machine guns were used on hull's sides, not providing a 360-degree coverage.FINNISH ARMY 1918 - 1945: LIGHT ARMOURED CARS The D-8 had a two-man crew sitting back to back so that the rear man could fire a rear-mounted machine gun. In 1932, the D-8 was upgraded with small turrets and had the DT machine gun mounted in it in order to reduce the vehicle's vulnerability. The D-8 was quickly phased out of production in lieu of the heavier and better equipped FAI armoured car. D-12 D-12 (Dyrenkov-12) was a Soviet light armored car based on the GAZ-A automobile. It was a further development of N.I. Dyrenkov's D-8 design. It was intended for infantry support and anti-aircraft roles. The fighting compartment had an open roof, where a 7.62mm PM-1910 or DT anti-aircraft machine gun was ring mounted. A 7.62 mm DT machine gun was also mounted in the front right of the vehicle. The original prototype contained ball mounts for DT machine guns which were not included in the production versions since it was excessive armament for the crew. The D-12 was produced alongside the D-8 at the Izhorskiy Factory. It was heavier than the D-8 but exhibited similar performance. Final testing took place in late 1931 together with the D-8. The D-12 was accepted into service with the Red Army and a small number were built at the Moscow Auto Zavod in 1932. The D-12 served during the early 1930s and was observed on Red Square during November 7 parades. Some vehicles remained in service during the war in 1941 and a few participated in the victory parade in Mongolia in 1945. Combat History The D-8 was first used by Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. D-8 was delivered as part of the USSR’s military aid. The D-8 and D-12 light armored cars were primarily used in a reconnaissance role versus a pure combat role. One D-8 was captured and used by the Finnish Defense Force during the Winter War against the Red Army.

Note the square-headed pan screw on the shaft of the clamp. In stagecraft, a c-clamp can refer to a number of different pieces of hardware, depending on its intended use. Lighting and sound In stage lighting and sound a c-clamp, also referred to as a pipe clamp, is used to attach a larger piece of hardware, such as a lighting instrument, a speaker, or a dimmer, to a pipe or batten. Newer c-clamps tend to be constructed of aluminum, although steel is also available. C-clamps function by affixing a bolt (the \\"shaft bolt\\") to the hardware they are to hold in place, such as through the yoke of a lighting instrument, and securely fastening this bolt to the clamp shaft. The open end of the clamp is then placed over the batten, and a bolt (the \\"clamp bolt\\") is tightened to secure the c-clamp. C-clamps for stage lighting fixtures usually also have a pan screw (also known as a \\"grub bolt\\"), which when loosened will allow the clamp shaft, and therefore the fixture, to be rotated 360 degrees while maintaining a secure connection to the batten. When using c-clamps care must be taken to not over-torque the clamp bolt which affixes the clamp to the batten. If this bolt is overtightened, it can easily dimple or \\"drill\\" into the batten seriously compromising the strength of the batten. =Parts= *Clamp: the main body of the clamp, is typically either cast steel or aluminium and designed to sit overtop of a typical theatrical batten. *Clamp Bolt: a long-threaded bolt (typically 9/16\\") designed to tighten down on a pipe, forcing it into the clamp. *Spigot: a machined metal shaft that sits in the clamp and rotates freely through 360°.

Carpentry A woodworking C-clamp C-clamps are commonly used in theatrical carpentry for the same purpose that non-theatrical carpenters employ them: for creating a quick, temporary, and non-destructive way of joining two objects together. Legs are commonly attached to platforms via c-clamp before they are fastened together using a more permanent method (i.e. bolts). Multi-platform assemblies are also commonly joined to one another solely with c-clamps, especially in touring situations where a set needs to be assembled and struck quickly.

Mikal Waters would end up replacing Rezabek after the band auditioned a few singers at Iguana Studios, and Steve DePace would replace Robertson on drums. This new version of Negative Trend played their first gig on June 1, 1978. It was this version of Negative Trend that recorded the band's first studio recordings. The eponymous 7\\" EP was produced by Debbie Dub. While the record is much more famous now, Dub and the band had a hard time giving the record away when it was produced. The record was released in September 1978 by the label Heavy Manners. Side one of the record included the tracks \\"Mercenaries\\" and \\"Meathouse\\", while side two had the tracks \\"Black and Red\\" and \\"How Ya Feelin\\".

Gray and Shatter heard that the band F-Word had broken up, and decided to recruit former F-Word singer Rik L Rik for Negative Trend. Gray and Shatter also asked drummer Tim Mooney, previously of the band The Sleepers, to take over for DePace. Shortly after the formation of this version of Negative Trend, the band went to Los Angeles to record five demos for Posh Boy Records. However, the only tracks released under the name Negative Trend from the recordings with Posh Boy Records were \\"Mercenaries\\" and \\"I Got Power\\" on the Tooth and Nail Compilation LP, released by Upsetter Records in 1979.

Mooney, Williams, and Gray would go on to form the band Toiling Midgets. = Reformation (2008-2010) = In July 2008, DePace put together a version of Negative Trend with himself on drums, Gray on guitar, Paul Hood on bass, and Paul Casteel singing. Rezabek was not asked to perform with the reformed version of the band. After the first gig, Tom Mallon took over Hood's position as bass player. After the second gig, DePace was forced to stop playing due to his commitments with the band Flipper. Tony Sales then replaced DePace on drums.

A 1,500-acre community, Park Heights comprises 12 smaller neighborhoods that together contain approximately 30,000 residents. It is bounded on the south by Druid Park Drive, on the west by Wabash Avenue, on the east by Greenspring Avenue, and on the north by Northern Parkway. Interstate-83 is less than a half mile to the east. Two major roadways—Park Heights Avenue and Reisterstown Road—run north-south through Park Heights, serving as the neighborhood's \\"Main Streets\\" as well as commuter corridors. Limited commercial uses—primarily retail—are scattered along these roads; there is also some industrial activity on the neighborhood's western edge.Park Heights Master Plan, pg. 4. Otherwise, Park Heights is characterized by residential uses, which run the spectrum from stable, well-tended streets to entire blocks of abandoned houses and lots. Major health care, educational, and social service institutions are located throughout the community, as well as one of Baltimore and the State of Maryland's most well-known landmarks, Pimlico Race Track.Park Heights Master Plan, pg. 8. The boundaries of Park Heights, as defined by the Baltimore City Planning Department, are bounded north and south by Park Circle and Northern Parkway and east and west by Greenspring and Wabash Avenues, respectively; and includes the neighborhoods of Arlington, Central Park Heights, Cylburn, Greenspring, Langston Hughes, Levindale, Lucille Park, the historic Park Circle, Park Lane, Pimlico Good Neighbor, Towanda/Grantley, Woodmere. Park Heights boasts one of the largest foreign born Black populations in Baltimore City, specifically in the areas surrounding Belvedere Avenue, with immigrants from Jamaica, Trinidad, Haiti, and other Caribbean countries. History Park Heights follows a classic pattern of many older American urban neighborhoods. Initially it was central to Baltimore's growing economy. Early in the 19th century, for example, Reisterstown Road served as a major route for transporting wheat and corn from farms northwest of the city to the port, where it was shipped down the Chesapeake Bay to the West Indies and Europe. The city began the formal annexation of Park Heights in 1888, but it was not until 1911 that the Reisterstown tollgates— one of which was located at what is now Park Circle—were dismantled. Starting in the early 19th century, Baltimore became a major port of entry for European immigrants. Many settled in the northern and western reaches of the city, with Park Heights serving as a kind of way station for several generations. By 1950, the neighborhood had been settled by the children of Jewish immigrants who had migrated from the Reservoir Hill area of Baltimore and before that from as far as the Jonestown area of Baltimore. During the late 19th century, as streetcars became a primary source of transportation, Park Heights' neighborhoods sprang up around an intricate system of streetcar lines. By 1920 two major streetcar routes ran along Park Heights Avenue and three crosstown lines on Belvedere Avenue. This dictated the positioning of retail and commercial nodes along these lines, surrounded by residential neighborhoods. A major destination reachable by streetcar was the Pimlico Race Course, which opened in 1870 as the Pimlico Fairgrounds and which triggered the development of nearby hotels, restaurants, and other entertainment venues. Those venues are now gone, but Pimlico remains. One day a year, during the running of the Preakness Stakes, it draws national attention and crowds of more than 100,000 to Park Heights. By 1945 the neighborhood was largely built out in its present form. Park Heights resembled a classic \\"streetcar suburb,\\" with lively commercial districts serving handsome, tree-lined residential blocks. Today, Park Heights is largely poor and more than 96% African American. This population shift occurred relatively quickly during the 1960s as a result of various social, economic, racial, and political factors faced by the city, state, and nation. These factors led to an exodus of whites from Baltimore into the surrounding counties. This dramatic shift is now reflected in the changed patient demographics of Sinai Hospital, the community's largest employer and primary health care provider. As one of only a dozen officially Jewish hospitals in the country, Sinai's patients were once close to 100% white and Jewish. Today, more than 50% of Sinai's patients are African American. There is a Star of David carved in stone on the community's Baptist and Pentecostal churches, which serves as a visible reminder of this recent and dramatic population shift. In 1929, Park Heights was home to Handler Field, a pioneer commercial airport where the Baltimore Airways Company served New-York to Baltimore daily service. In 2010, a beating occurred in Upper Park Heights. An African-American teenager was attacked by two white Orthodox Jewish men after they received a report of suspicious activities from an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood watch group. One of the men received convictions for false imprisonment and second degree assault, while the other was acquitted on all charges.\\"1 convicted in Md. beating case compared to Trayvon Martin slaying.\\" The Associated Press at The Gainesville Sun. Thursday May 3, 2012. Retrieved on May 9, 2019. Public transportation The Park Heights area is served by multiple modes of public transportation, provided by the Maryland Transit Administration. On all parts of Park Heights Avenue itself, Bus Route 54 provides frequent single-seat service. Bus service is also provided on small portions of Park Heights Avenue by Routes 58 and 97. Route 53 also operates nearby on the parallel Reisterstown Road, and Routes 27, 33, 44, 60, and 91 operate on streets crossing Park Heights Avenue. The Baltimore Metro Subway has several stations within a close walk of the Park Heights area. There are also many shuttles provided for senior citizens by various apartments and non-profit organizations. Crime During the past few decades (1980-2000), the Lower Park Heights area has had high crime rates, and was ranked by the Baltimore Police Department as one of the highest per capita crime areas of the city. Over the years, various city officials have attempted to take steps to reduce crime in the area and improve safety for residents. These measures have included improved police presence, surveillance cameras, and redevelopment or remodeling of abandoned structures. Since 2010, Park Heights has witnessed growth and urban renewal, as a preferred area of investment for many developers. In 2018, Larry Hogan pledged $52 Million over the next 10 years to bring Park Heights back to the vibrancy it boasted in the 1950s.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci- neighborhood-investment-fund-20181217-story.html Notable residents * Steve Krulevitz (born 1951), American-Israeli tennis player See also * List of Baltimore neighborhoods References  External links  * Northwest District Maps Category:Caribbean-American culture in Maryland Category:Czech- American culture in Baltimore Category:Ethnic enclaves in Maryland Category:Haitian-American culture in Maryland Category:Jamaican-American history Category:Jewish communities in the United States Category:Jews and Judaism in Baltimore Category:Neighborhoods in Baltimore Category:Orthodox Jewish communities Category:Orthodox Judaism in Baltimore Category:Trinidadian and Tobagonian-American culture ","title":"Park Heights, Baltimore"},{"id":"9814856","text":"Tous dans l'même bâteau (All in the Same Boat) is the debut album by Canadian progressive rock group CANO, released in 1976.

History =18th and 19th centuries= Early historical events, settlement and incorporation While several American Indian tribes are known to have lived in the area occupied by present-day Lake Charles, the first European settlers arrived in the 1760s. The Calcasieu River Bridge as seen from downtown Lake Charles. In 1781 Martin LeBleu and his wife, Dela Marion, of Bordeaux, France were the first recorded Europeans to settle in the area now known as the LeBleu Settlement. Charles Sallier, one of the first settlers, married LeBleu's daughter, Catherine LeBleu; the Salliers built their home on the beach in what is current-day Lake Charles. The area on the east side of the Calcasieu River was defined as the southern part of the \\"Neutral Ground\\" until ratification of the Adams-Onís Treaty that was ratified in 1821. The infamous pirate, Jean Lafitte, once delivered stolen slaves and contraband to James Bowie and other plantation owners in the area. By 1860 the area become known as Charles Town in Sallier's honor. The Rio Hondo, which flowed through Lake Charles, was later called Quelqueshue, a Native American term meaning \\"Crying Eagle\\". Transliterated through French, this became the name of Calcasieu Parish. On March 7, 1861, Lake Charles was officially incorporated as the town of Charleston, Louisiana. Industrial growth and the Civil War The city's growth was fairly slow until Captain Daniel Goos, a Frisian by birth, came to the city in 1855. Goos established a lumber mill and schooner dock, in what became known as Goosport. He promoted a profitable trade with Texan and Mexican ports by sending his schooner downriver into the Gulf of Mexico. Until the arrival of Goos, a man named Jacob Ryan dominated the lumber industry. Between 1817 and 1855, timber sales from longleaf pine and bald cypress remained the city's primary source of economic revenue. Jacob Ryan convinced the state government to move the parish seat to Lake Charles from its former location at Marion, a settlement about eight miles (13 km) upriver. Later that year, Ryan and Samuel Kirby transferred the parish courthouse and jail by barge to the then-named Charleston. Six years after the city was incorporated, dissatisfaction over the name Charleston arose; on March 16, 1867, Charleston, Louisiana, was renamed and incorporated as the town of Lake Charles. By the time of the U.S. Civil War, many Americans from the North, along with a large influx of continental Europeans and Jews, had come to settle the area. Attitudes toward slavery in Lake Charles were mixed, as slavery was secondary to business interests. In fact, fewer than five percent of the population were slaves. Many citizens became involved in the war. Some local families supported the Confederacy, while others supported the cause of the Union. After the Civil War In the years following the Civil War, Lake Charles regained its status as a lumbering center. Especially in the 1880s, the city saw an increase in population and economic demand largely due to an innovative advertising campaign by J.B. Watkins. Thanks to this campaign, the city's population grew four-hundred percent during this decade. Using the pine wood from the city's mills, construction of large Victorian mansions transformed Lake Charles during the 1890s. Carpenters competed with verve to out-build each other with their use of elaborate fretwork and decoration. The area of present-day Lake Charles located just east of downtown is known as the Charpentier Historic District from the French word for carpenter and features unique homes from this era. Lumber industry In the early 1880s Michigan lumber tycoons, including R. H. Nason and N. B. Bradley, as well as William E. Ramsey (originally from Canada) had purchased large tracts of land in the area. In 1887 the \\"Bradley-Ramsey Lumber Company\\" was formed by the \\"Michigan Men\\" that included Ramsey, Nason, Bradley, Lewis Penoyer and Benton Hatchett, with over 150,000 acres. The company built two sawmills (Michigan mill and the Mt. Hope mill) in the area. The mill of J. A. Bel, a local businessman originally from New Orleans but in the area from youth, became the second largest.Lake Charles Emerges as Early Lumber Center: (pp. 10)- Retrieved 2018-11-28 =Twentieth century= Ryan Street in Lake Charles, 1903. On April 23, 1910, a great fire, known as the Great Fire of 1910 devastated much of the city. The 1890 courthouse, along with most of downtown Lake Charles, was destroyed. Two months afterwards, the Louisiana legislature divided the former Imperial Calcasieu Parish into the current parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Calcasieu. However, Lake Charles soon rebuilt itself and continued to grow and expand. A view of Downtown Lake Charles, circa 1917 After World War II, Lake Charles experienced industrial growth with the onset of the petrochemical refining industries. The Lake Charles Civic Center, built on reclaimed land on the lakefront in the 1970s, hosted many national shows, acts, and pop singers such as Elvis. The city grew to a high of some 80,000 people in the early 1980s, but with local economic recession, the population declined. With the advent of the gaming industry, the city has begun again to see growth. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 71,757. =Present day= The destructive force of Hurricane Rita. Looking down the remains of the lakefront boardwalk toward the damaged Harrah's Lake Charles Casino property. Lake Charles suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Rita, which struck the city as a Category 3 storm early September 24, 2005. On September 22, the mayor ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city, and approximately ninety percent of the residents left. Evacuees were asked to not return for 48 hours, due to wind and flood damage. There was extensive damage to the city's electrical grid, and many areas did not have power restored for up to three weeks. On June 20, 2006, a Citgo petroleum plant located in Sulphur, Louisiana released between of oil into the Calcasieu Ship Channel. The United States Coast Guard was called in to contain the spilled oil, which had by this time flowed down the Calcasieu River. Because of the disaster, the Coast Guard had to close many waterways, including the Calcasieu River Channel and a one-mile (1.6 km) stretch of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The Port of Lake Charles remained closed for some time after the accident due to contamination. Oil prices surged to over $74 per barrel in part due to the Citgo spillage. The Calcasieu Refining Co., which normally processes of oil a day, was working at low levels for weeks after the incident. As part of the city's recovery from Hurricane Rita, elected officials proposed a plan to renovate the downtown area to make it more attractive and pedestrian-friendly. A primary concern for the downtown revitalization was to include quality and affordable housing. To fund this proposal, officials proposed a city-wide bond issue. To date, about one third of the 90-million dollar bond proposal has been spent. The Lakefront Promenade is currently under construction, as is the 52-berth marina just south of the Civic Center grounds. The monies issued from the bond will also be used for other capital projects throughout the city. In 2008, a report showed that overall criminal offenses were down 15%, and major crimes were down 9% in the city. In 2020, the city was heavily damaged again by Category 4 Hurricane Laura.

It is the largest independent online retailer of computer and electrical goods in the United Kingdom. The Ebuyer website is the 210th most visited site in the United Kingdom [Alexa.com ranking] and has 4 million registered customers. History Ebuyer was founded in November 1999 in Sheffield by Paul Cusack, Mike Naylor, Steve Kay, Neeraj Patel, and Adam Ashmore – with startup capital of £250,000 from Paul Cusack, its annual turnover was in excess of £220 million by September 2005. Stuart Carlisle was its Managing Director (CEO) from 2014 until resigning in 2015. As of 2020, Ebuyer was owned by Malcolm Healey's West Retail Group. Security In July 2008, Gavin Brent, from Holywell in Flintshire, North Wales admitted stealing goods worth £20,000 from the firm before returning the goods, and demanding full refunds. Brent, whose suspicious transactions were spotted by Ebuyer's security team, went on to conduct an online campaign against the company and the investigation. This included menacing Ebuyer staff and a police officer from Brent's now-defunct blog. Controversy During 2005 Ebuyer had significant customer service problems. Sheffield Trading Standards received 282 complaints about the company, and the customer service phone number had been removed from its website. After this, the firm promised to improve its service, and restored the customer service number to its site. Average daily telephone wait times are published. On 28 November 2011, eBuyer ran a £1 promotion via email, offering new deals on the hour until midnight. eBuyer angered customers when their website was unable to handle the extra traffic, causing it to crash. When the website did work, many customers were emailed after successfully ordering and paying for items, only to be told they were out of stock. Many customers vented their anger at the company on their Facebook page, however eBuyer ran a campaign on their customer forums in an attempt to counter the bad publicity. In December 2013, eBuyer posted pictures to Facebook of its staff wearing Christmas themed jumpers. However, a Facebook user named Phil spotted that one of the images contained a leaderboard in the background that suggested that eBuyer staff were rated on the number of returns that they reject. eBuyer responded to these accusations by stating that these were return merchandise authorizations (RMAs) avoided by providing technical advice.

Originally a private estate, it was converted to a museum in 1992, and now contains a number of archeological finds, fine and applied art collections, folk art, and ethnographic exhibits, as well as a restored orangery. Nearby is a sculpture garden featuring a reconstruction of a Lithuanian solar calendar. The museum is operated by the Kretinga district municipality. History The manor's location had always provided shelter from maritime winds in the area. Its modern history is said to have begun when the bishop of Vilnius, Ignacy Jakub Massalski, planted fruit trees there in the late 18th century. In 1874 the land was purchased in an auction by Count Tyszkiewicz. In the course of creating a family manor, he converted the existing residence into a palace, built the orangery, now known as the Winter Garden (), and re-landscaped the grounds. The landscaping included cascading ponds, a waterfall, arbors, fountains, sculptures, and parterres. The idea of turning the manor into a museum is credited to Juozas Žilvitis (1903–1975); the Kretinga Museum Committee was established in 1935. The garden was completely destroyed during World War II. In 1940 the museum became a branch of the Kaunas State Museum (now the Vytautas the Great War Museum). In 1987 the greenhouse was rebuilt; since 1998 the Kretinga Estate Park Friends Club has been a co-sponsor. Exhibits and expositions The exhibits portraying the life of the Tyszkiewicz family occupy seven halls, and contain family portraits, furniture, photographs, household objects, and paintings. The folk art exhibits contain textile art and works of Lithuanian cross crafters. Household articles include tools and furniture used during various eras. Recent exhibitions have featured jewelry, ceramics, printed matter of historic interest, and folk costumes. The gardens and the orangery, which contains a cafe, are frequently updated. The museum sponsors concerts, scientific and research projects, holiday specials, a \\"Tree Feast\\", and folk dance presentations.

Batanga Media's digital properties include Batanga.com, Batanga Radio, iMujer.com, and BolsadeMulher.com. Founded in 1999 by Troy McConnell, Luis Brandwayn and Jochen Fischer in North Carolina, Batanga Media is now headquartered in Miami, Florida with operations in 14 countries including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. Batanga Radio was an online music streaming service owned and operated by Batanga Media.http://bradio.com/ Batanga Radio users stream millions of songs per year and create over hundreds of thousands of custom stations every month. Batanga Radio was built to be an online radio application. Batanga Radio users can “tell” the application to add or remove certain artists, songs, genres and even decades of music. Batanga Radio's playlist technology reacts to user interactions and a user’s location. Song lyrics are also available on every song page and as every song plays. With every song that plays on Batanga Radio, users receive a list of five similar tracks to explore, listen to and/or add to their playlists. Using the songs and artists already chosen by users, the application identifies new songs that are similar. Batanga Radio is accessible across mobile and tablet devices. In 2016, Batanga Media and Discovery Networks became partners.  Using bRadio  A station is set by specifying an artist, song, or mood. Listeners can tune into hundreds of pre-made genre stations, tens of thousands of artist radio stations, or browse the entire music library directly in order to indicate musical preferences (songs can not be played directly). bRadio is available in both English and Spanish. Listeners can indicate their preferences by directly responding to each track played, either favorably (by selecting the happy face button), or unfavorably (by selecting the sad face button), which determines if the track should be played, as well as how often similarly classified songs should be played on the station. Responding unfavorably to a track (selecting the sad face button) immediately stops playback of the track. An artist, song, or mood can be excluded from playing entirely. Within the section located directly under the music player, titled \\"We Recommend You,” listeners can indicate which songs, artists, or moods to add or remove from their station by selecting the gray icon directly to the right of the words \\"We Recommend You.” This brings up a search bar where listeners can type in the name of a song, artist, or mood that can then either be added in order to provide variety to the listener’s station, or excluded from their station entirely. Also, a blue plus sign appears on the lower right-hand corner of the album art for the track that is currently playing, and once this button is clicked, it brings up the choice: “Comprar,” (Spanish for “Buy”) which allows listeners to buy the song directly from iTunes. Upon clicking on the blue plus sign, registered users also have the option of voting on whether or not they like a song by selecting “me gusta” (smiley face), or “no me gusta.”  Mobile Devices  The Batanga Radio app is available across most mobile platforms and is available in both English and Spanish. * Batanga was available on the Google Android OS (for tablets and mobile phones, requires Android 2.1 and up). * Batanga was available across all iOS platforms, including iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. * Batanga was available on Blackberry (Operating System: 4.5.0 or higher). The Batanga Radio app allows listeners to: * Build customized stations * Listen to an editorial station * View lyrics * Like songs /dislike songs * Comment * Add artist/song preferences * Remove specific artists or songs from stations * Read artist news * View artist pages * Explore similar tracks  Name change: Vix.com  In early 2017, Batanga Media announced the change of its name to Vix.com, and described their new editorial line and approach as follows: \\"We create content that sparks curiosity and adds value to millions of people every day.

He became a Fellow and Tutor at University College, Oxford, in 1806, deacon in 1806 and priest in 1807. He then became rector of Ryton in 1811, joining a prestigious group with previous rectors including Thomas Secker, later Archbishop of Canterbury. After his time as rector of Holy Cross Church, Ryton, he became Canon (1829) and then Archdeacon of Durham in 1831 and, a year later, became the first warden of the University of Durham. Thorp remained heavily involved with the university, also being the first master of University College. This was a position he held until his death in Durham in 1862. He was buried at Ryton Church. He had married twice. Achievements Charles Thorp's life was remarkable for a number of notable achievements: Regarding education for all as necessary and empowering, he was a prime mover in introducing free education to Ryton. A committed anti-slavery campaigner, he worked with the Church Missionary Society to set up a university in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to ensure that freed slaves had access to education. An environmentalist well ahead of his time, he planted Ryton's churchyard with oak, sweet chestnut and beech trees, now in their maturity. In a similar far sighted move, he arranged for his family to buy the Farne Islands, employing a wildlife warden to protect threatened bird species. As an innovator in alleviating poverty, he set up this country's first 'penny bank', in Ryton, allowing those with small incomes to borrow at rates they could afford. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1839. His name was chosen as the identity of a secondary school in West Gateshead in 2011, Charles Thorp Comprehensive School (now Thorp Academy), following the amalgamation of Hookergate School and Ryton Comprehensive School, on the site of the school he sponsored in his lifetime.

The native of Hoboken, New Jersey, began his professional baseball career with the Chambersburg Young Yanks of the Blue Ridge League in 1930. He had a batting average of .306 that year, a personal best. He then was acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals' organization and toiled in their system for five years, including three with the top-level Rochester Red Wings. Carey reached the majors in with the Cardinals' American League rivals, the St. Louis Browns, spending three years with them before moving to the Boston Red Sox (1939–42; 1946). His most productive season came in his rookie season with the Browns, when he hit .273 and posted career-highs in runs (58), RBI (57), doubles (27), triples (6) and games played (134). In an eight-season career, Carey was a .275 hitter with 418 hits two home runs and 167 RBI in 466 games. Carey missed the 1943–45 baseball seasons while serving in the United States Navy during World War II. In , he returned to the Red Sox, but played only three games before joining the coaching staff of manager Joe Cronin for the balance of the season, during which Boston won the AL pennant. He then worked briefly in the Red Sox' farm system as a coach and manager. He died in Rochester, New York, at the age of 63.

History Warning notices at the lock There are references to a flash lock and winch in the 16th century. There was also a ferry at the lock. The pound lock was built in 1773, the sixth downstream of the eight constructed after the passing of the 1770 navigation act. Like the others it had to be rebuilt in 1782 and though estimates were obtained for stone and timber, timber was chosen because it was cheaper.

From its eastern terminus at the frontage road nearly east of the I-19 interchange, the highway heads in a western direction before curving towards the southwest. The highway eventually curves back towards the west until it turns north towards the lake. There is a Y junction where the road branches off to the lake to the north and a forest road that continues west that connects to a very scenic drive through the Coronado National Forest. This road passes Arivaca Peak, Sycamore Canyon, the ghost town of Ruby and continues west to the town of Arivaca and SR 286. This stretch requires four-wheel drive and there are no services along the entire stretch.  History  An unpaved road existed along the current route since 1935. The route was established as SR 289 in 1959, when it only ran west from US 89 to the Coronado National Forest boundary. The next year, the route was extended westward to Peña Blanca Dam.

The Press published more than 200 books and other publications between 1988 and 2010. The majority of the University of Scranton Press' catalog are scholarly works dealing with religious issues, such Catholicism, Judaism and the Jesuit tradition, as well as regional issues specifically related to Northeast Pennsylvania. The University of Scranton Press published approximately 24 publications annually at its height. History The University of Scranton Press was founded in 1988 by Reverend Richard W. Rousseau, S.J., who served as the chairman of the University's Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the time. In the mid-1990s, Father Richard Rousseau hired Trinka Ravaioli, a graphic designer, to design the covers for its publications. Ravaioli continued to design most of the covers for the books published by the University of Scranton Press from the mid-1990s until the Press ceased publication in 2010. Approximately one-third of the Press' books and other publications dealt directly with issues related to Northeast Pennsylvania, including its history, culture and economy. Many of the books were written or submitted by local authors and writers based in the region. Titles related to Catholicism, with an emphasis on Jesuit issues, constituted most of the rest of the Press' catalog. The Press was housed in the University of Scranton's Smurfit Art Center, a former Universalist church purchased by the university in 1987. The University of Scranton Press is a founding member of the Association of Jesuit University Presses, but was not a current member of the Association of American University Presses as of 2010. Some of the University of Scranton Press' most recent publications included a biography of Edith Stein and a book exploring the lives of early 20th Century European immigrant coal miners in Pennsylvania. Closure The University of Scranton Press began declining the submission of new works in early 2010. In August 2010, the University of Scranton's provost and vice president for academic affairs, Harold Baillie, announced that the Press would close at the end of summer 2010. Baillie cited cost-cutting measures and changing financial priorities for the decision to close the university's scholarly publisher, \\"Basically, it was a budgetary decision.

Life He was born in Palma, Majorca, the son of a chocolate maker. By the age of four he was already showing unusual musical talent, and by eleven he was playing violin for a Palma opera company, for which he wrote a Fantasía para violin which enjoyed a notable triumph. Between 1859 and 1863 family finance enabled him to study in Paris, after 1861 as a violinist at the Paris Conservatoire with Massard. In 1863 he was admitted to the orchestra of the Théâtre Lyrique, and began studying composition, and instrumentation with Hector Berlioz. He returned to Majorca when called up to his military service, but in 1866 he resumed his studies at the Madrid Royal Conservatory, studying Violin with Monasterio and Composition with Emilio Arrieta whilst playing in the orchestra of the Teatro de la Zarzuela. After 1878 he was Inspector of the National Music Schools. He also taught singing at the Foundling Girls' School in Madrid, and published a handbook for violin teachers. In 1894 he retired to his home city of Palma. He published some philosophical books like Dios y la inmortalidad del alma. He died there in 1918 aged 74. Of his five symphonies only the Third was printed during his lifetime. The whole cycle has been edited by Ramón Sobrino in 1993-2003.

It was the successor to the Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks (MFT) option of System/360's operating system OS/360. OS/VS1, in comparison to its predecessor, supported virtual memory (then called virtual storage).IBM press release concerning memory virtualization from 2005 OS/VS1 was generally available during the 1970s and 1980s, and it is no longer supported by IBM. Description OS/VS1 was OS/360 MFT II with a single virtual address space; by comparison, OS/VS2 SVS was OS/360 MVT with a single virtual address space. OS/VS1 was often installed on mid-range IBM mainframe systems, such as the System/370 Model 145 and, later, the System/370 Model 148.\\"System/370 Model 148\\", IBM OS/VS1 was intended to manage a medium-sized work load (for the 1970s) consisting only of batch processing applications, running within a fixed number of operating system partitions via the batch job management system Job Entry Subsystem 1 (JES1). This was in contrast to OS/VS2 which was intended to handle larger work loads consisting of batch applications, online interactive users (using the Time Sharing Option, or TSO), or a combination of both. However, OS/VS1 could, and often did, support interactive applications and users by running IBM's CICS transaction processing monitor as a job within one of its partitions.\\"History of CICS\\", IBM Installation and modification of OS/VS1 was accomplished via IBM's cumbersome System Generation (SYSGEN) process. Remote Entry Services (RES) OS/VS1 included a replacement for OS/360 RJE. It allowed submission and retrieval of jobs by 2770, 2780 and 3780 terminals and by workstation programs included with OS/VS1 for, e.g., 1130. RES included Remote Terminal Access Method and a closer integration with Job Management than what RJE had. IBM upgrades OS/VS1 went through seven product releases. OS/VS1 Release 7 was enhanced by fourth release of the IBM OS/VS1 Basic Programming Extensions (BPE) product. BPE provided support for new 1980s hardware, such as 3380 DASD (disk). The last OS/VS1 product release, OS/VS1 Basic Programming Extensions (BPE) Release 4, was announced by IBM in 1983 for general availability in March 1984 (product 5662-257, announcement letter 283-266, 15 September 1983). IBM announced the end of functional enhancements to OS/VS1 in 1984.OS/VS1 Consolidated Stabilization Statement, product 5652-VS1, announcement letter 284-086, 23 February 1984. IBM recommended OS/VS1 installations migrate to MVS/370 or MVS/XA. To assist with the migration to MVS/XA, IBM made the VM/XA Migration Aid. It allowed installations to run OS/VS1 and MVS/XA simultaneously on the same machine, as guests of a third systemVM/XA. This way, the new MVS/XA system could be tested while the old production OS/VS1 system was still in use. Time-sharing Although IBM's Time Sharing Option (TSO) required VS2, customers with a 370/145 or 370/148 had other time-sharing options. One combination was VM/CMS for time sharing, and a guest \\"machine\\" running OS/360 MFT II for batch.During the 1970s, some universities ran the above combination during the day, and \\"went native\\" (no VM/CMS) at night, to run heavy batch work, e.g. administrative =Conversational Remote Job Entry= Optional component of OS/360 MFT II, OS/360 MVT and OS/VS1, CRJE allowed the user at a line-mode terminal to edit text datasets, submit jobs and access job output. =TONE for VS1= A non-IBM time-sharing product named TONE (TSO- like, for VS1 / VS ONE)mentioned in Computerworld, Dec. 6, 1976, p. 22; the article mentions the planned 1977 release of version III of Tone) was marketed by Tone Software Co.the p. 72 ad from the Feb. 21, 1977 issue of Computerworld, can be found at https://books.google.com/books?id=LD44Qbu9AsUC&pg;=PA72&lpg;=PA72 and the headline says \\"The ONLY COMPLETE TIME SHARING SYSTEM FOR VS1\\" References Further reading *Functional structure of IBM virtual storage operating systems, Part I: Influences of dynamic address translation on operating system technology, by M.

It operated from 2003 until 2009 when it was shut down after being acquired by MySpace. The company was founded in 2003 by Dalton Caldwell (formerly of VA Linux) and Jan Jannink (formerly of Napster), and many of its core engineering team came from the original Napster file-sharing service. The company takes its name from \\"meme\\", a term coined by biologist Richard Dawkins to describe the ideas and cultural phenomena that spread as if they had a life of their own. Helping to pioneer the free, advertising-supported model for online music, imeem permitted consumers to legally upload, stream and share music and music playlists for free with the costs supported by advertising. In 2007, imeem became the first-ever online music site to secure licenses from all four U.S. major music labels to offer their music catalogs for free streaming and sharing on the web. The company also created the web's first embeddable music and video playlists. People could use imeem's widgets to embed songs and playlists from imeem virtually anywhere on the web, including on their MySpace and Facebook profiles or on their personal blogs. Headquartered in San Francisco's South of Market district (SoMa), imeem had additional offices in New York City and Los Angeles. The company's investors included Morgenthaler Ventures and Warner Music Group. On December 8, 2009, imeem was bought out by MySpace Music in a firesale for an undisclosed amount. However, it is stated to have been less than $1 million.MySpace buys imeem music site for under $1 mln Business model Revenue generation at imeem was through a combination of direct and indirect advertising sales, sales of MP3 downloads, ringtones and concert tickets, and subscription revenue from premium services. The bulk of its revenue came from advertising; advertisers who ran direct campaigns with imeem included TheTruth.com/American Legacy Foundation, Kia Motors, and Dr Pepper, among others. The company was one of the pioneers of the ad- supported streaming music model. In 2007, imeem became the first-ever online music site to secure licenses from all 4 major music labels to offer their music catalogs for free streaming and sharing on the web. Under this model, artists and labels were paid a share of imeem's ad revenue in proportion to the popularity of their music on imeem, and had the right to register their content and determine how (or whether) that content is available on the site or through its embeddable widgets. This business model was made possible by imeem's proprietary content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. Initially, imeem licensed this technology from SNOCAP, the digital rights and content management startup founded by Napster creator Shawn Fanning. In 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP and its technology outright. imeem continued to operate the SNOCAP digital registry, and used the technology acquired from SNOCAP to power its ad-supported streaming music service. Products The company provided two main services: imeem.com, where people could discover, stream and share music and music videos for free, and imeem Mobile, an Internet radio service for mobile devices. In addition, the company offered a premium service, imeem VIP, that gave people access to additional features on the imeem site. =imeem.com= Registered users of the site could stream and share millions of songs and tens of thousands of music videos free of charge, with the costs for licensing and streaming supported by advertising on the site and on imeem Mobile. One of imeem's key features was the playlist. Users could create personal playlists, via a \\"Create Music Playlist\\" page, with music they had uploaded themselves or with music and video already available on the site. They could publish and share these playlists on imeem, where they could be played by, shared with, commented on, or tagged by other users. Visitors could also share music, videos and playlists beyond imeem, either by embedding imeem players into external sites. =imeem Mobile= With the free cell phone application imeem Mobile, users could discover, purchase and enjoy music on their mobile device. It was available as a free download to users on the Android and iPhone/iPod touch platforms. Users could create custom Internet radio stations based on their favorite artists, discover new music through personalized recommendations and buy DRM-free MP3 downloads directly onto their mobile device (on Android, downloads are from the Amazon MP3 application; on the iPhone and iPod touch, downloads are from the iTunes Store. The app also enabled people to browse and stream their personal imeem music libraries to their mobile device. People could upload up to 20,000 songs of the music they own directly to imeem.com, and then access that music through their mobile devices. To upload more than 100 songs, users had to subscribe to one of imeem's premium services. The company introduced imeem Mobile on the Android platform in October 2008, and launched it for iPhone and iPod touch users in May 2009. At launch, it was the only streaming music application on the Android platform, which in turn led to it being one of the most popular applications installed on Android devices. In June 2009, imeem Mobile crossed a milestone of over 1 million installs on the Android and iPhone platforms. The application received several awards, including a 2009 Crunchie Award for Best Mobile Application, the Editor's Choice award from the blog AndroidGuys, and an award for 'Best Streaming Music App' in the 2009 Android Network Awards. =imeem VIP= In 2008, imeem launched a premium imeem VIP service that gave subscribers access to additional site features, most prominently the ability to upload more music (over 100 songs), and to watch videos up to 1080p in resolution. There were three imeem VIP subscription tiers. * The imeem \\"VIP\\" plans started at US$$9.99 per year for the \\"VIP Lite\\" plan, which gave subscribers access to streaming songs through the VIP Player, and 480p video (up from 360p for basic users). The \\"VIP\\" subscription option allowed uploading of up to 1,000 songs and viewing of 720p video, for $29.99 per year. And the \\"VIP Plus\\" subscription allowed uploading of up to 20,000 songs and viewing of 1080p video, for $99.99 per year History =Early history: 2003-2005= The imeem service has changed drastically since its original inception as a messaging application that let people communicate by online chat, blogging, instant messaging and file sharing.imeem Introduces Fun, Secure Way to Share Personal Content with Friends and Colleagues Online The service was billed as a \\"distributed, peer- to-peer, social network\\". Founder Dalton Caldwell began working on what would become the imeem messaging application during Thanksgiving weekend in 2003. Initially, he worked on the software from his home. In 2004, imeem moved into offices in downtown Palo Alto's 285 Hamilton building, with Caldwell, Jannink and a small team of engineers continuing work on the software. The company first unveiled its software in February 2005 at the DEMO conference and formally launched it that August. When imeem first launched, to use the service, users were required to download and install the desktop messaging and file-sharing software; the imeem Web site merely existed as a means for users to register and download the client. Though originally designed for messaging, it was the file-sharing function that took off. The client software supported the service's distributed database model: Every imeem client on the network had a database that would generate and store references to media content shared on the network; this system would accelerate access to content deemed to be close to the user. The service's media-sharing was peer-to-peer - if a user shared photos or a podcast, then the data would only exist on the client database network; users who wanted to view the actual content would access it by peering directly with the publisher. =2006= In March 2006, imeem re- launched at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin, Texas, with a new focus on enabling people to interact through the imeem.com website, using media (photos, videos, music) to express their personalities and interests. Timed to coincide with the re-launch, imeem introduced new features enabling users to upload and play music and video on the site. In September 2006, imeem introduced embeddable Adobe Flash-based playlists that gave people the ability to take music and video playlists they created (or found) on the site and embed them virtually anywhere on the web. The company's players quickly became popular with consumers using MySpace and other social networks, giving them a way to customize & personalize their profiles with music. As a result, imeem quickly gained traction, with the site's traffic growing to 10 million unique monthly users by the end of 2006. By March 2007, imeem's monthly traffic reached over 16 million unique monthly users. =2007= In February 2007, MySpace took steps to limit the posting of imeem content on its site: any updates or comments with \\"imeem\\" even mentioned in them were removed upon posting. However, MySpace stopped blocking imeem in 2008. In March 2007, imeem announced it was partnering with SNOCAP, the digital rights and content management startup founded by Napster creator Shawn Fanning, to enable legal uploading, streaming and sharing of music on imeem, utilizing SNOCAP's content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. The goal was to provide a way for consumers to upload and share music with their friends, for free, and to do so in a way where label and artists can both make money and have greater control over where and how their music was available. The partnership marked imeem's move to an ad-supported model, in which consumers could freely stream and share music and video content with the costs supported by advertising. Under this model, artists and labels are paid a share of the site's ad revenue in proportion to the popularity of their music on imeem, and have the right to register their content and determine whether that content is available on the site or through its embeddable widgets. Ultimately, the imeem messaging and file-sharing application had proven to be something of a resource hog for power-users, since the database could grow to large proportions just by associating with a few individuals who were sharing a lot of content. This messaging product was ultimately phased out; the site became entirely Web- based beginning in June 2007. While this distributed model was interesting and received positive press, it proved to be difficult to attract many users since the only way to participate was to download the imeem client software. Over time, imeem integrated many of the client's features into its website and the innovative distributed database model was centralized. Throughout the first half of 2007, imeem had negotiated with the major labels to secure licenses for this new model. Warner Music Group and imeem announced a licensing agreement for imeem's new Web-based service in July 2007, followed by Sony Music Entertainment and EMI Music in September. In December 2007, imeem signed a licensing agreement with Universal Music Group, becoming the first online music service to partner with all four major music labels to let people legally stream and share music for free online. =2008= On January 28, 2008, imeem announced that it was acquiring the music locker service Anywhere.FM. On February 1, 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP. It had already been making extensive use of SNOCAP's audio fingerprinting technology and music database. As part of the acquisition, SNOCAP's chief operating officer, Ali Aydar (ex-Napster), joined imeem. On March 24, 2008 imeem announced the launch of a developer's platform that will permit third-party developers to interact with imeem data. In April 2008, imeem received a new round of funding from Sequoia Capital. In October 2008, imeem launched imeem Mobile, a free mobile music application. However, on the 22nd of that month, the company laid off 25% of its staff. =2009= The company's troubles continued into 2009, as Warner Music wrote off its entire $15 million investment in imeem in anticipation that no return would come of it and at the same time Warner didn't extend their licensensing with Imeem. It seemed possible the company could close in April 2009, but it was able to renegotiate deals with its major label partners, and subsequently found enough new investors to continue service. Sources told TechCrunch that imeem raised $6 million in this most recent funding round, with Morgenthaler Ventures and Warner Music Group among those investing. The company launched imeem Mobile for the iPhone and iPod touch in May 2009. In June 2009, imeem Mobile crossed a milestone of over 1 million installs on the Android and iPhone platforms. On June 25, 2009, imeem announced that it was removing all user-uploaded video and photos from the site.Simplifying imeem This move, and the lack of advance notice, was unpopular with many users. In October 2009, imeem and Google announced the integration of links to music on imeem within Google search results; imeem was one of several online music companies involved in such efforts. Closure On December 8, 2009, MySpace (owned by News Corporation) acquired imeem, and angered many imeem users when the new parent company closed down the beleaguered service on the same day, redirecting all imeem traffic to MySpace Music. Furthermore, MySpace social network did not pay artists or labels the money still owed to them by imeem for music streaming. The controversial closure was criticized as a sign that MySpace was out of touch with the times. MySpace, on December 22, 2009, assured imeem.com users that their playlists are safe and that they are currently duplicating every user's playlist and will migrate them on to MySpace Music as soon as possible. MySpace assured that features and functionality that users were used to at imeem would soon find their way onto MySpace, and complement the existing platform alongside free full-song streaming, artist profiles, music videos, and more. MySpace will email imeem users the instructions on how to claim their playlists. On January 15, 2010, MySpace began allowing users to import imeem playlists. However, songs that are currently not available via MySpace Music were not converted over, and there was no means provided to even recover the names of the missing tracks. Additionally, user \\"favorites\\" metadata was not able to be carried over, with the result that users who depended upon their favorites lists instead of normal playlists were unable to retrieve their music. Other complaints include incorrect artist info, garbled tracks, and an increase in between-songs advertising. Technology The back-end software for imeem's services was primarily written in C#. While most of the front-end Web servers ran under Microsoft Windows, some used the Linux operating system. The Web site heavily used Ajax programming and Flash animation. Audio streams were delivered as 128 kbps-quality MPEG-2 Audio Layer III (MP3) format. Video was encoded in the Sorenson Video codec at >700kbit/s, in the Flash Video (FLV) container format, with resolution resized to 400 pixels wide and preserving its aspect ratio, and with embedded mp3 audio at 96 kbit/s. While the video quality and resolution was significantly better than other video sites at that time (YouTube, for example, used 300kbit/s video) the late-arriving video sharing aspect of imeem was largely eclipsed by the original audio sharing component. In 2008 imeem upgraded the video quality further and became one of the first media sharing sites to offer video encoded with the MPEG 4 H.264 codec and at the original source resolution. The original imeem client software conducted most of its network activity using an encrypted protocol, making it difficult to monitor user activity. Thus, conversations via the client's IM functionality and group chats were encrypted and only visible to participants. On startup, the application validated with a central server. This ensured that unauthorized clients could not connect and run malicious exploits (such as for monitoring network traffic or spoofing identities) against the network. Software updates were also delivered via the client and authenticated before they were installed. The company's move to a Web-based file-sharing business model in 2007 made most of these considerations moot. Copyright infringement lawsuit Warner Music Group announced on July 12, 2007 that it had dropped its copyright infringement lawsuit against imeem by agreeing to license its music and video content to the site for a percentage of imeem's advertising revenue. Financial details were not disclosed. Under the agreement, imeem could carry music and videos from all of the record company's artists. Warner also released financial statements indicating that it invested $15 million into imeem. =Meems (groups)= Users of imeem could link to each other through topic groups (which were originally called meems), based on common interests. Some meems were created by imeem itself, while others were user-generated. Media content could be placed in custom profile pages and topic groups, as well as in browseable content channels and charts. Meems could serve as basic online communities for artists, bands, clubs, films, schools, festivals, concert tours, friends, and sports enthusiasts. A late redesign of the site replaced most of the \\"meem\\" references with the familiar word \\"group\\". Early on, it had been possible for links to be made between groups which had related subject matter, but this feature had only been implemented in the original client software. After the transition to the Web-only service model, it became impossible for users to add (or even remove) such links, although official imeem-created groups sometimes had links added at creation time, by an administrative means not available to subscribers.

Biography McCormack became the bass player in The Wildhearts in 1991, and soon relocated to London with the band, enjoying success during their commercial peak, before the splits in 1997 and 1998. McCormack went on to form and front The Yo-Yos, with Tom Spencer (ex-Sugarsnatch/The Lurkers), and the band released an album on Sub Pop Records, but they eventually split in 2000. He re-joined The Wildhearts when they reformed in 2001, but was dropped midway through a tour. He rejoined again in 2002, but left once more in 2003. At the time the group's frontman Ginger penned an open letter to Kerrang! magazine documenting his close friend's drug problems and wished him a complete recovery. Unexpectedly, he returned to The Wildhearts in 2005 for a live DVD. McCormack briefly played with Dogs D'Amour before re-forming The Yo- Yos in 2005, and recording an EP, \\"Given Up Giving Up\\". He subsequently supported his younger brother Chris McCormack's band, 3 Colours Red, on their final tour of Germany, but the band fired Danny McCormack halfway through a UK tour in 2005 following further drug problems. He continues to write and live in South Shields. In late 2006, McCormack announced on his MySpace page that he is working on a new project that is tentatively titled 'The I-Told-You- So's'. Following a prolonged absence from the music scene for a number of years, McCormack took the stage to play bass at his 40th birthday. The special event featured two gigs in one night at Camden Barfly in London on 17 February 2012. Performances came from a reunited Yo-Yos - consisting of McCormack, Spencer and Rich Jones along with guest drummers - as well as a covers set featuring Chris McCormack, Andy Cairns (Therapy?), Ritch Battersby and Stidi (both The Wildhearts). The support band for the night was Plan A - which featured former Wildhearts guitarist Jef. In 2015, McCormack founded a band called The Main Grains which would later release an EP called Don't Believe Everything You Think. Ahead of the mini-album's release, McCormack almost died after suffering an aneurysm in late 2015 - which later culminated in him losing his lower leg. The four-piece punk n roll group later played support on a few UK dates of the Ginger Wildheart Band's July 2016 tour. During one of the shows (at the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds on 14th July 2016), McCormack and Ginger played onstage for the first time in more than a decade - with Ginger later announcing he and McCormack had finally buried the hatchet and were friends again. He re-joined the Wildhearts in 2018. In 2019, McCormack recorded bass with The Wildhearts for their new album \\"Renaissance Men\\", the first album the band had released since 2009's Chutzpah and McCormack's first since 1997's Endless Nameless. The album charted at 11 in the UK charts following its release in May 2019. McCormack continues to tour and perform with the band.

Biography After initial studies with Ginette Martenot, Nigg entered the Paris Conservatory in 1941 and studied harmony with Olivier Messiaen and counterpoint with Simone Plé-Caussade. In 1945, he met René Leibowitz, who introduced him to the twelve-tone technique of composition. Together with other Leibowitz pupils, Antoine Duhamel, André Casanova and Jean Prodromidès, he gave the first performance of Leibowitz's Explications des Metaphors, Op. 15, in Paris in 1948.Maguire, Jan. Rene Leibowitz (II): The Music, Tempo, New Series, No. 132 (March 1980), pp. 2-10 After completing a Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments and a Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra (both 1943), and the symphonic poem Timour (1944), he became the first French composer to write a dodecaphonic work when his Variations for Piano and 10 Instruments appeared in 1946. This piece was premiered at the International Festival of Dodecaphonic Music, organized by Leibowitz in 1947. In 1956, Nigg was appointed a member of the Music Committee for French state broadcasting. From 1967 to 1982, he was a member of the music management for the French Ministry of Culture, after which he taught classes in instrumentation and orchestration at the Paris Conservatory, and became President of the Société Nationale de Musique.

The first pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773. The weir stretches a long way upstream above the lock. History Marlow lock house, viewed from inside the chamber before being filled to travel upstream A weir at Marlow is recorded in Domesday book, and there are 14th century records of a winch to pull traffic through a flash lock. The lock was very problematical and in the 16th and 17th century there are accounts of conflicts between millers and navigators. A particular problems was the shallow draught. The first pound lock was built of fir in 1773, the seventh downstream of the eight built after the 1770 navigation act. It was upstream of the present lock on still proved problematical. Rollers were needed to guide barges in, and as there was no towpath, barges needed tow ropes several hundred feet long. The lock needed extensive repairs in 1780 and a year later eel bucks had to be removed from the flash lock in case it was needed. The first lock house was erected in 1815 and in 1825 the lock was reconstructed on its present site of Headington stone. The weir was rebuilt in 1872.Fred. S.

Retrieved on November 25, 2009. Music career =Pinhead Circus (1999)= Pinhead Circus formed in 1988 with Jimmy Pinhead, guitarist, Trevor, bassist, and Otis as the drummer. In 1997 the band caught their attention of BYO Records and released their first album, Detailed Instructions for the Self Involved, later that year. Brandon joined Pinhead Circus in 1999 after their drummer Otis left. Pinhead then released their second album, Everything Else Is Just a Far Gone Conclusion in 1999 through BYO Records.

The band returned to the studio in December 2002 to work on their second full-length, Revolutions Per Minute in 2003 and toured for 2003's Warped Tour, which gained the band some success. Rise Against then signed to Dreamworks Records in late 2003 to begin the recording of their third record, but Dreamworks was shortly absorbed by the Universal Music Group, and Rise Against found itself with major label Geffen Records. Todd Mohney, the band's guitarist at the time left and was replaced by Chris Chasse and began the recording of the new album Siren Song of the Counter Culture. Siren Song of the Counter Culture was released on August 10, 2004 peaking at number 136 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album charts, gaining the band major success with the singles \\"Give It All, \\"Swing Life Away\\", and \\"Life Less Frightening\\".

He was a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was married to the younger sister of statesman Kaneko Kentarō. During the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War, there were some U.S. financiers who wished to profit by lending money to Russia so she could continue her war efforts against Japan. In contrast and in support of ending this war, Frank A. Vanderlip, Jacob Schiff and other U.S. financiers supported President Theodore Roosevelt's successful role as peacemaker between Russia and Japan. Their action was greatly appreciated by many of the leaders of Japan. The early decades of the 1900s were often challenging in terms of U.S. Japan relations. Frank A. Vanderlip and his American and Japanese allies strove to encourage increased business and trade between their nations, which could also enhance the mutual respect and understanding between the U.S. and Japan. The 1908 photo illustration to the right is linked to Frank A. Vanderlip during his U.S. business delegation’s visit to Japan, where they were greeted by Baron Shibusawa Eiichi, Prince Tokugawa Iesato (aka Prince Iyesato Tokugawa), and Baron Dan Takuma and other Japanese representatives. These fine statesman often allied together to promote peace and international commerce. During following year in 1909, in reciprocation for Frank A. Vanderlip’s 1908 business delegation’s visit to Japan, Baron Shibusawa accompanied by his approximately sixty member Japanese business/goodwill delegation toured the United States. During their U.S. visit, the Japanese were greeted by the Vanderlip family and top representatives of American Industry, such as General Electric and Westinghouse. As president of the Japan Society of Manhattan, Frank A. Vanderlip strove to maintain political goodwill and better understanding between the U.S. and Japan. Takuma Dan continued the cultivation of closer relations between Japan and the Western powers. In 1921, he also led a Japanese Businessmen's Mission, in which a group of Japanese business leaders visited the United States, Great Britain, and France to discuss bilateral economic issues and to promote personal ties with businesspeople of those countries. For heroically standing in the way of Japanese militants who would take Japan down the road to war, on March 5, 1932, Dan was assassinated by right-wing nationalist Gorō Hishinuma as part of the League of Blood Incident.

In the standard notation of modular arithmetic this congruence is written as :ax \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}, which is the shorthand way of writing the statement that divides (evenly) the quantity , or, put another way, the remainder after dividing by the integer is 1. If does have an inverse modulo there are an infinite number of solutions of this congruence which form a congruence class with respect to this modulus. Furthermore, any integer that is congruent to (i.e., in 's congruence class) will have any element of 's congruence class as a modular multiplicative inverse. Using the notation of \\\\overline{w} to indicate the congruence class containing , this can be expressed by saying that the modulo multiplicative inverse of the congruence class \\\\overline{a} is the congruence class \\\\overline{x} such that: :\\\\overline{a}\\\\cdot_{m} \\\\overline{x} = \\\\overline{1}, where the symbol \\\\cdot_m denotes the multiplication of equivalence classes modulo . Written in this way the analogy with the usual concept of a multiplicative inverse in the set of rational or real numbers is clearly represented, replacing the numbers by congruence classes and altering the binary operation appropriately. As with the analogous operation on the real numbers, a fundamental use of this operation is in solving, when possible, linear congruences of the form, :ax \\\\equiv b \\\\pmod{m}. Finding modular multiplicative inverses also has practical applications in the field of cryptography, i.e. public-key cryptography and the RSA Algorithm. A benefit for the computer implementation of these applications is that there exists a very fast algorithm (the extended Euclidean algorithm) that can be used for the calculation of modular multiplicative inverses. Modular arithmetic For a given positive integer , two integers, and , are said to be congruent modulo if divides their difference. This binary relation is denoted by, :a \\\\equiv b \\\\pmod{m}. This is an equivalence relation on the set of integers, , and the equivalence classes are called congruence classes modulo or residue classes modulo . Let \\\\overline{a} denote the congruence class containing the integer ,Other notations are often used, including and . then :\\\\overline{a} = \\\\\\\\{b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\mid a \\\\equiv b \\\\pmod{m} \\\\\\\\}. A linear congruence is a modular congruence of the form :ax \\\\equiv b \\\\pmod{m}. Unlike linear equations over the reals, linear congruences may have zero, one or several solutions. If is a solution of a linear congruence then every element in \\\\overline{x} is also a solution, so, when speaking of the number of solutions of a linear congruence we are referring to the number of different congruence classes that contain solutions. If is the greatest common divisor of and then the linear congruence has solutions if and only if divides . If divides , then there are exactly solutions. A modular multiplicative inverse of an integer with respect to the modulus is a solution of the linear congruence :ax \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}. The previous result says that a solution exists if and only if , that is, and must be relatively prime (i.e. coprime). Furthermore, when this condition holds, there is exactly one solution, i.e., when it exists, a modular multiplicative inverse is unique. When has a solution it is often denoted in this way − :x \\\\equiv a^{-1} \\\\pmod{m}, but this is an abuse of notation since a modular multiplicative inverse is an integer and is not an integer when is an integer other than 1 or - 1. The notation would be proper if is interpreted as a token standing for the congruence class \\\\overline{a}, as the multiplicative inverse of a congruence class is a congruence class with the multiplication defined in the next section. =Integers modulo = The congruence relation, modulo , partitions the set of integers into congruence classes. Operations of addition and multiplication can be defined on these objects in the following way: To either add or multiply two congruence classes, first pick a representative (in any way) from each class, then perform the usual operation for integers on the two representatives and finally take the congruence class that the result of the integer operation lies in as the result of the operation on the congruence classes. In symbols, with +_m and \\\\cdot_m representing the operations on congruence classes, these definitions are :\\\\overline{a} +_m \\\\overline{b} = \\\\overline{a + b} and :\\\\overline{a} \\\\cdot_m \\\\overline{b} = \\\\overline{ab}. These operations are well-defined, meaning that the end result does not depend on the choices of representatives that were made to obtain the result. The congruence classes with these two defined operations form a ring, called the ring of integers modulo . There are several notations used for these algebraic objects, most often \\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z} or \\\\mathbb{Z}/m, but several elementary texts and application areas use a simplified notation \\\\mathbb{Z}_m when confusion with other algebraic objects is unlikely. The congruence classes of the integers modulo were traditionally known as residue classes modulo m, reflecting the fact that all the elements of a congruence class have the same remainder (i.e., \\"residue\\") upon being divided by . Any set of integers selected so that each comes from a different congruence class modulo m is called a complete system of residues modulo . The division algorithm shows that the set of integers, form a complete system of residues modulo , known as the least residue system modulo . In working with arithmetic problems it is sometimes more convenient to work with a complete system of residues and use the language of congruences while at other times the point of view of the congruence classes of the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z} is more useful. =Multiplicative group of integers modulo = Not every element of a complete residue system modulo has a modular multiplicative inverse, for instance, zero never does. After removing the elements of a complete residue system that are not relatively prime to , what is left is called a reduced residue system, all of whose elements have modular multiplicative inverses. The number of elements in a reduced residue system is \\\\phi(m), where \\\\phi is the Euler totient function, i.e., the number of positive integers less than that are relatively prime to . In a general ring with unity not every element has a multiplicative inverse and those that do are called units. As the product of two units is a unit, the units of a ring form a group, the group of units of the ring and often denoted by if is the name of the ring. The group of units of the ring of integers modulo is called the multiplicative group of integers modulo , and it is isomorphic to a reduced residue system. In particular, it has order (size), \\\\phi(m). In the case that is a prime, say , then \\\\phi(p) = p-1 and all the non-zero elements of \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} have multiplicative inverses, thus \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} is a finite field. In this case, the multiplicative group of integers modulo form a cyclic group of order . Example To illustrate the above definitions consider the following example using the modulus 10. Two integers are congruent mod 10 if and only if their difference is divisible by 10, for instance :32 \\\\equiv 12 \\\\pmod{10} since 10 divides 32 − 12 = 20, and :111 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{10} since 10 divides 111 − 1 = 110. Some of the ten congruence classes with respect to this modulus are: :\\\\overline{0} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\cdots, -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\} :\\\\overline{1} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\cdots, -19, -9, 1, 11, 21, \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\} :\\\\overline{5} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\cdots, -15, -5, 5, 15, 25, \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\} and :\\\\overline{9} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\cdots, -11, -1, 9, 19, 29, \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\}. The linear congruence has no solutions since the integers that are congruent to 5 (i.e., those in \\\\overline{5}) are all odd while is always even. However, the linear congruence has two solutions, namely, and . The and 2 does not divide 5, but does divide 6. Since , the linear congruence will have solutions, that is, modular multiplicative inverses of 3 modulo 10 will exist. In fact, 7 satisfies this congruence (i.e., 21 − 1 = 20). However, other integers also satisfy the congruence, for instance 17 and −3 (i.e., 3(17) − 1 = 50 and 3(−3) − 1 = −10). In particular, every integer in \\\\overline{7} will satisfy the congruence since these integers have the form for some integer and :3(7 + 10 r) - 1 = 21 + 30 r -1 = 20 + 30 r = 10(2 + 3r), is clearly divisible by 10. This congruence has only this one congruence class of solutions. The solution in this case could have been obtained by checking all possible cases, but systematic algorithms would be needed for larger moduli and these will be given in the next section. The product of congruence classes \\\\overline{5} and \\\\overline{8} can be obtained by selecting an element of \\\\overline{5}, say 25, and an element of \\\\overline{8}, say −2, and observing that their product (25)(−2) = −50 is in the congruence class \\\\overline{0}. Thus, \\\\overline{5} \\\\cdot_{10} \\\\overline{8} = \\\\overline{0}. Addition is defined in a similar way. The ten congruence classes together with these operations of addition and multiplication of congruence classes form the ring of integers modulo 10, i.e., \\\\mathbb{Z}/10\\\\mathbb{Z}. A complete residue system modulo 10 can be the set {10, −9, 2, 13, 24, −15, 26, 37, 8, 9} where each integer is in a different congruence class modulo 10. The unique least residue system modulo 10 is {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}. A reduced residue system modulo 10 could be {1, 3, 7, 9}. The product of any two congruence classes represented by these numbers is again one of these four congruence classes. This implies that these four congruence classes form a group, in this case the cyclic group of order four, having either 3 or 7 as a (multiplicative) generator. The represented congruence classes form the group of units of the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}/10\\\\mathbb{Z}. These congruence classes are precisely the ones which have modular multiplicative inverses. Computation =Extended Euclidean algorithm= A modular multiplicative inverse of modulo can be found by using the extended Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm determines the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers, say and . If has a multiplicative inverse modulo , this gcd must be 1. The last of several equations produced by the algorithm may be solved for this gcd. Then, using a method called \\"back substitution\\", an expression connecting the original parameters and this gcd can be obtained. In other words, integers and can be found to satisfy Bézout's identity, :ax + my = \\\\gcd(a, m)= 1. Rewritten, this is :ax - 1 = (-y)m, that is, :ax \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}, so, a modular multiplicative inverse of has been calculated. A more efficient version of the algorithm is the extended Euclidean algorithm, which, by using auxiliary equations, reduces two passes through the algorithm (back substitution can be thought of as passing through the algorithm in reverse) to just one. In big O notation, this algorithm runs in time , assuming , and is considered to be very fast and generally more efficient than its alternative, exponentiation. =Using Euler's theorem= As an alternative to the extended Euclidean algorithm, Euler's theorem may be used to compute modular inverses.Thomas Koshy. Elementary number theory with applications, 2nd edition. . P. 346. According to Euler's theorem, if is coprime to , that is, , then :a^{\\\\phi(m)} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}, where \\\\phi is Euler's totient function. This follows from the fact that belongs to the multiplicative group (\\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z})× if and only if is coprime to . Therefore, a modular multiplicative inverse can be found directly: :a^{\\\\phi(m)-1} \\\\equiv a^{-1} \\\\pmod{m}. In the special case where is a prime, \\\\phi (m) = m - 1 and a modular inverse is given by : a^{-1} \\\\equiv a^{m-2} \\\\pmod{m}. This method is generally slower than the extended Euclidean algorithm, but is sometimes used when an implementation for modular exponentiation is already available. Some disadvantages of this method include: *The value \\\\phi (m) must be known and the most efficient known computation requires 's factorization. Factorization is widely believed to be a computationally hard problem. However, calculating \\\\phi (m) is straightforward when the prime factorization of is known. *The relative cost of exponentiation. Though it can be implemented more efficiently using modular exponentiation, when large values of are involved this is most efficiently computed with the Montgomery reduction method. This algorithm itself requires a modular inverse mod , which is what was to be calculated in the first place. Without the Montgomery method, the standard binary exponentiation, which requires division mod at every step, is a slow operation when is large. One notable advantage of this technique is that there are no conditional branches which depend on the value of , and thus the value of , which may be an important secret in public-key cryptography, can be protected from side- channel attacks. For this reason, the standard implementation of Curve25519 uses this technique to compute an inverse. =Multiple inverses= It is possible to compute the inverse of multiple numbers , modulo a common , with a single invocation of the Euclidean algorithm and three multiplications per additional input. The basic idea is to form the product of all the , invert that, then multiply by for all to leave only the desired . More specifically, the algorithm is (all arithmetic performed modulo ): # Compute the prefix products b_i = \\\\prod_{j=1}^i a_j = a_i b_{i-1} for all . # Compute using any available algorithm. # For from down to 2, compute #* and #* . # Finally, . It is possible to perform the multiplications in a tree structure rather than linearly to exploit parallel computing. Applications Finding a modular multiplicative inverse has many applications in algorithms that rely on the theory of modular arithmetic. For instance, in cryptography the use of modular arithmetic permits some operations to be carried out more quickly and with fewer storage requirements, while other operations become more difficult. Both of these features can be used to advantage. In particular, in the RSA algorithm, encrypting and decrypting a message is done using a pair of numbers that are multiplicative inverses with respect to a carefully selected modulus. One of these numbers is made public and can be used in a rapid encryption procedure, while the other, used in the decryption procedure, is kept hidden. Determining the hidden number from the public number is considered to be computationally infeasible and this is what makes the system work to ensure privacy. As another example in a different context, consider the exact division problem in computer science where you have a list of odd word-sized numbers each divisible by and you wish to divide them all by . One solution is as follows: # Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute , the modular multiplicative inverse of , where is the number of bits in a word. This inverse will exist since the numbers are odd and the modulus has no odd factors. # For each number in the list, multiply it by and take the least significant word of the result. On many machines, particularly those without hardware support for division, division is a slower operation than multiplication, so this approach can yield a considerable speedup. The first step is relatively slow but only needs to be done once. Modular multiplicative inverses are used to obtain a solution of a system of linear congruences that is guaranteed by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. For example, the system :: ≡ 4 (mod 5) :: ≡ 4 (mod 7) :: ≡ 6 (mod 11) has common solutions since 5,7 and 11 are pairwise coprime. A solution is given by : = (7 × 11) × 4 + (5 × 11) × 4 + (5 × 7) × 6 where : = 3 is the modular multiplicative inverse of 7 × 11 (mod 5), : = 6 is the modular multiplicative inverse of 5 × 11 (mod 7) and : = 6 is the modular multiplicative inverse of 5 × 7 (mod 11). Thus, : = 3 × (7 × 11) × 4 + 6 × (5 × 11) × 4 + 6 × (5 × 7) × 6 = 3504 and in its unique reduced form : ≡ 3504 ≡ 39 (mod 385) since 385 is the LCM of 5,7 and 11.

It was directed by Paul Czinner, and stars Elisabeth Bergner as Catherine, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., as Grand Duke Peter, Dorothy Hale as Countess Olga, and Flora Robson as Empress Elizabeth. The movie was banned in Germany. On 14 March 1934 this matter invoked a question in the British Parliament (House of Commons): \\"Is it to be understood that no British film in which there is a Jewish actor or actress will be permitted to be shown in Germany in future?\\".retrieved April 26, 2020 Plot This historical drama recounts the events that led to the accession of Catherine the Great, Empress of all the Russias. The film opens with the arrival in 1744 of Princess Sophie Auguste Frederika – whose name would be changed to ‘Catherine’ – from her father's court of Anhalt- Zerbst (in modern Germany) to the court of the Empress Elizabeth. \\"Little Catherine\\" is to marry the Grand Duke Peter, nephew and heir presumptive of the unmarried and childless Empress Elizabeth. Peter already displays signs of mental instability and a sharply misogynist streak. He rejects Catherine on their wedding night, reacting to something innocently said by his French valet, claiming that she used feminine tricks to win him over. In time, though, Peter accepts her and they have a happy marriage for a while. Meanwhile, Catherine gains important experience of government from working as principal aide to the empress. The empress dies and Peter becomes tsar, but his mental illness is starting to get the better of him, along with sheer boredom in the job. Catherine still loves him despite beginning a very public love affair with one of her best friends – until one night when Peter goes one step too far in publicly humiliating his wife. She ceases to love him, which enables her to be clear-headed in supporting a planned coup d'état. The following morning, he is arrested and Catherine is made Empress of All the Russias. The elevation is marred by Peter's murder that very morning, contrary to Catherine's command. Grigory Orlov explains that everything has a price, and the crown has the highest price of all. The film ends, with Catherine in tears on her throne, while the cheers of the crowds are heard outside.

His parents were both liberated Africans from Egba in south western Nigeria.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Lewis travelled to England by way of the relationship between his father William and the captain of a merchant ship that was shipping goods from Freetown to England. Political career and legal luminary Lewis went to England in 1866. He entered the Middle Temple, and then the chambers of Samuel Danks Waddy. He moved on to a chancery chambers, and was called to the bar in 1871. He returned to Freetown in 1872.

The language is attested between 500 BC and 200 AD. Some two thousand inscriptions are known written in the Ancient South Arabian Monumental Script, known as Musnad. These inscriptions are mainly found in Wādī Bayhān and Wādī Ḥārib to the south-east of Ma'rib, and from the plateau to the south of that area. Qatabanian inscriptions increase after the beginning of the 4th century BC when the Sabaeans ceased to dominate the area, and Qatabān became an independent kingdom. Qatabanian was spoken in an area across the kingdom of Qatabān as far as Jabal al-'Awd (near Zafar) in the southwest, and if we are to believe the Greek and Latin writers, it went as far as Bāb al-Mandab on the Red Sea. At the end of the 2nd century AD, Saba' and Ḥaḑramawt finally defeated Qatabān, and the inscriptions ended.Leonid Kogan and Andrey Korotayev: Ṣayhadic Languages (Epigraphic South Arabian).

The language used to write inscriptions in the kingdom of Awsān, known as Awsānian (or Awsānite) is virtually identical to Qatabānic, but it is so badly attested (25 inscriptions), that it remains uncertain whether it is a Qatabānic dialect or a distinct language. Numerals Qatabānian has an unusual form for the cardinal number \\"one\\" - ṭd / fem. ṭt ; this has no known cognates in any of the ancient Semitic languages, although it does appear in modern South Arabian languages (cf.

The Penny Harvest empowers children from preschool to high school–in every life circumstance–to become socially engaged philanthropists. Each school year, students begin by launching a school-wide campaign to address community concerns by gathering idle pennies. Then, instead of Common Cents allocating the funds, the program places responsibility for grant-making entirely in student hands. A team of student leaders, known as the Philanthropy Roundtable, spends the winter debating community needs, investigating organizations, and deciding democratically how to best allocate their school's collection. Throughout the spring, Roundtables leverage their philanthropic dollars to promote student volunteering in their neighborhood, as well as quality service-learning tied to the classroom curriculum. Finally, the year closes with citywide and school-based ceremonies designed to drive outcomes and sustain the program the following year. Penny Harvest History The Penny Harvest began in 1991 with a question from then 4-year old Nora Gross – \\"That man is cold. Why can't we take him home?\\" She was referring to a homeless man she saw while walking on NYC's Broadway with her father Teddy Gross, founder of Common Cents and the Penny Harvest. That question was the catalyst for what was to become the Penny Harvest program. Gross began \\"harvesting\\" in his building, \\"asking neighbors if they had any pennies, and how they would feel about giving them to the homeless.\\" Penny Harvest Outcomes The Penny Harvest performs well within schools in every neighborhood. Since the beginning, Penny Harvest students have allocated over $10.5 million in pennies, volunteered 47 million service hours, and awarded 25,105 community grants to help their neighborhoods. Last year 246,932 youth participated, including 7,611 student leaders selected to represent their communities in Philanthropy Roundtables at 448 New York City schools. Awards 2012: Lyndon B.

Originally built in 1937 as a retreat for a local Norbertine Order, the Lodge was purchased by Packers coach and general manager Curly Lambeau in 1946 and then heavily renovated, making it the first self-contained training facility in professional football history. Although the facility was state-of- the-art at the time, many members of the Packers franchise and local fans complained of its high cost, distance from Green Bay, Wisconsin, and its poor practice field. The Lodge burned down in 1950, with the likely cause being faulty electrical wiring or lightning. The Packers received $75,000 in insurance from the fire, which would be used to help reestablish the Packers' long-term financial security. Lambeau resigned from the Packers just a week after the fire, citing a lack of unity in the team's direction between him and the Packers' board of directors. The Rockwood Lodge site would lay vacant for a number of years before being purchased by Brown County, Wisconsin, and developed into a public park. History Rockwood Lodge was built in 1937 as a retreat for the Norbertine Order, whose abbey was located in nearby De Pere. The grounds were located approximately north of the city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, on of land sitting on a limestone bluff overlooking the eponymous Green Bay, an arm of Lake Michigan. The Lodge itself was a stone and timber cross-shaped mansion that comprised 40 rooms, including a large lobby and fireplace. The Norbertines built a boat dock, tennis courts, a baseball field, and an amphitheater on the grounds. The facility was rented for weddings or other public events. Green Bay Packers An aerial view of Rockwood Lodge in the late 1940s. The practice field, located in the bottom of the photo, was added by the Packers after purchasing the property. From 1935 to 1947, the Packers hosted their training camp at Pinewood Lodge, a resort in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. However, Packers head coach and general manager Curly Lambeau had a desire to develop a training facility where his players and their families could live together for the entire season. He had been \\"smitten\\" with Rockwood Lodge and in 1946 convinced the Packers board of directors to authorize the purchase of the estate for $32,000 (), which at the time was a significant amount of money for the Packers. They also authorized an additional $12,000 () for renovations and the construction of cottages for players' families. The renovations made the Lodge \\"a state-of-the-art football facility complete with lockers, classrooms, dorms and a restaurant-quality kitchen\\". It is also considered to be the first self-contained training facility in pro football history. The Lodge was widely praised by those who were connected to the Packers. The facility provided free housing for players and their families and strengthened team chemistry. However, the Lodge was not without controversy. The players complained that the field was extremely hard and led to multiple injuries. This hardness was caused by the location of the Lodge and practice field on a granite bluff above Lake Michigan. On some days, Lambeau had to move practices to softer fields near the team's then-home, City Stadium. The players derisively called the Lodge \\"The Rock\\"--a veiled reference to Alcatraz Island. Many team executives also thought the cost of the facility and renovations were exorbitant, considering the purchase price was 25% of the team's yearly operating budget. While Lambeau had held near-complete control over the Packers' day-to-day operations for three decades, some members of the Packers' board felt the facility was a step too far and nearly resigned. Lastly, many fans were disappointed at the distance from Green Bay to Rockwood Lodge and missed seeing the players and practices in town. The facility also proved to be a severe drain on the Packers' finances, who were also facing poor on-field performance and a possible merger with the All-America Football Conference that many feared would lead to the team folding or being moved to another market. 1950 fire alt=Rockwood Lodge burning with only part of the walls and chimney remaining On January 24, 1950, Rockwood Lodge, empty except for a caretaker and his family, caught fire. The family was unharmed, but the building completely burned down except for the stone walls and chimney. Everything in the building except a couch and a photo of Curly Lambeau, including all of the caretaker's possessions, was destroyed. The building's large wood roof, cellulose insulation, and heavy winds all contributed to the destruction. The cause of the fire was never officially ascertained, although faulty wiring or a lightning strike was suspected. Due to the Packers' financial woes and the lack of a clear cause of the fire, rumors quickly spread that someone linked with the team deliberately set the fire for the insurance money. These rumors still persist, however they have been debunked based on interviews with the caretaker's family and team officials. A number of consequences resulted from the fire. First, the insurance money of $75,000 () ended up providing a significant boost to the team's financial outlook. Instead of rebuilding the facility, the team used the insurance money, funds from a special Thanksgiving Day intra-squad game, and a stock sale to return the team to profitability. Second, Lambeau resigned his position with the Packers about a week after the fire, citing a \\"dangerous disunity of purpose within the corporation\\". Earlier, he had rejected a new contract that would have stripped him of all non-football duties. Lambeau did not retire from football though, as he quickly moved to Chicago to coach the Cardinals football team. Lastly, after the fire, the Packers moved their training camp to Grand Rapids, Minnesota, from 1950 through 1953. They then moved to Stevens Point, Wisconsin, from 1954 to 1957, before switching to St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin, where they train .  Bay Shore Park After sitting dormant for a number of years, the area comprising Rockwood Lodge was purchased from the Packers by Brown County, Wisconsin. In 1968, the county was awarded $33,500 () from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to help develop a new county park. Bay Shore Park opened in 1974, although some boating facilities and parking were developed later in the mid-1970s. The park includes campgrounds, picnic areas, a playground, trails, and parking. The park's boat facilities include a ramp, a breakwater, and docks. Although little remains from the Packer years, the park still hosts Packers-related activities.

History The 141st Field Artillery is an historic American military unit that is currently part of the Louisiana Army National Guard headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana. It traces its lineage to a militia artillery battery back to 1838, and its heritage includes substantial combat service in several major wars. It earned the Presidential Unit Citation (US) for its service in World War II. The Washington Artillery was founded on 7 September 1838, as the Washington Artillery Company. It received its regimental flag in August 1846 after serving under Zachary Taylor in the Mexican–American War. Civil War service 26 May 1861 the Unit was mustered into the American Civil War; four companies served in the Army of Northern Virginia and a fifth was in the Army of Tennessee. Elements of the Washington Artillery participated in over sixty major actions. A few notable engagements include: Battle of Antietam, Battle of Perryville, Battle of Gettysburg, Battle of Shiloh, Battle of Chickamauga, Battle of Fredericksburg, First Battle of Manassas, and the Battle of Cold Harbor. After the Civil War, it was reorganized as an independent unit called the \\"Louisiana Volunteer Field Artillery\\" where it served the United States in the occupation of Cuba. It later was called into service to protect the Mexican border in 1916. A year later it received the designation 141st Artillery. In early 1941, the 141st Field Artillery was mobilized for World War II where it earned the Presidential Unit Citation; a duplicate unit was formed, the 935th Field Artillery Battalion, with both serving in Europe and North Africa. The anti- tank batteries of the battalion were separated in mid-1941, and formed the 773rd Tank Destroyer Battalion. On 1 July 1959, the 141st and 935th Field Artillery Battalions were consolidated with Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 204th Antiaircraft Artillery Group, 527th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion, and the 219th Antiaircraft Artillery Detachment to form the 141st Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System to consist of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Howitzer Battalions, elements of the 39th Infantry Division, the 4th Automatic Weapons Battalion, and the 5th Detachment. The 141st Artillery was redesignated on 1 May 1972 as the 141st Field Artillery to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 256th infantry Brigade. It was withdrawn 30 June 1986 from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System. In 2004 through 2005 and again in 2010, the 141st FA as part of the 256th Infantry Brigade mobilized to Baghdad, Iraq, in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn. On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Mississippi Hurricane Katrina. Retrieved 24 November 2011 while most members of the Washington Artillery were still serving their final weeks of deployment in Iraq. Following the return of the battalion to Louisiana, a detachment immediately mobilized to New Orleans to aid law enforcement with rescue efforts. With the help of the Louisiana State Police, those efforts transitioned into a support mission for the New Orleans Police Department.

The station was opened on June 1, 1958, on the second line of the metro between Ploshchad Vosstaniya and Ploshchad Lenina. It was named after Lenin Square, the location of its surface vestibule. In the early plans, it was named \\"Finland Station.\\"  Surface vestibules  The surface vestibule of the station was designed by architect A.K. Andreev. It was built into the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal building. The wall of the entrance hall is decorated with a panoramic mosaic that commemorates Lenin's speech before the workers and soldiers of Petrograd on April 3, 1917. It was created by artists A.I. Mylnikov and A.L. Korolyov. In 1962, Andreev worked together with Yu.N. Kozlov and the engineer Ye.A. Erganov to design and complete second entrance from Botkinskoy street. Both entrances are served by three escalators.  Architecture and decoration  Ploshchad Lenina is a deep underground pylon station at depth. The underground hall was designed by architect A.K. Andreev. The station's theme commemorated Lenin's return from Finland to Petrograd in June 1917. Like the Chernyshevskaya station, completed in the period when Soviet architects tried to move away from architectural excesses of Stalinist era. As the result, the station is plain, somewhat bare bones and inexpressive. The station used the contrasting red and white tones as its color scheme. The platform hall is faced with marble. On the platform walls are decorative grilles with the inscription \\"1958,\\" the year the station was opened. In 2006 the lighting of the station was redone, with mercury lamps replaced by sodium lamps. On one hand, the station gained a brighter look, but on the other hand the color palette was entirely changed.

He was a foremost expert on sedimentology, Devonian reefs, carbonate diagenesis, porosity development and the structure of the Rocky Mountains. His research has provided useful applications to the petroleum industry. Early life Mountjoy was raised near Calgary, Alberta, in the 1930s and 1940s. Regular visits to the nearby mountains led him into a career of geological research. He obtained a B.A.Sc. from the University of British Columbia in 1955 and a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in 1960. Career From 1957 to 1963, Mountjoy worked for the Geological Survey of Canada, first as a technical officer, then as a geologist. He left the survey to be an assistant professor at McGill University. In 1969, he was promoted to associate professor. In 1974, he was made a full professor. Between 1993 and 1998, Mountjoy was a Logan Professor. At the time of his death (2010), he was professor emeritus in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University. Most of Mountjoy’s research has concentrated on Jasper National Park's Miette area, and in particular on its exposed coral reefs from the Devonian period (395 million to 345 million years ago). Mountjoy, with Queen's University professor Raymond A. Price, mapped most of the Canadian Rockies between Banff and Jasper. This work produced cross-sections, which have become classic representations of the structure of a thrust-fold mountain belt and have been published in many textbooks. He also studied ancient and modern reef geology, carbonate petrology and diagenesis, carbonate reservoirs and stratigraphy. He visited and applied his knowledge to the geology of Australia, China and Germany. He directed the research of over 50 master's and doctoral students, many of whom have gone on to become professors. Mountjoy died June 18, 2010, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Located in the Gärdet section of the inner-city district Östermalm, the museum offers a panoramic view of the bay Djurgårdsbrunnsviken. The building was designed by architect Ragnar Östberg and built in 1933–36.  Collections  The museum houses about 900,000 photos, 50,000 objects and 45,000 drawings, all related to the sea, coast, ships and boats, past and present. A major part of the collection, the boats, are housed in Boat Hall 2 at Galärvarvet in Stockholm. The boat collection ranges from canoes to Skerry cruisers. On the bottom floor there are, among other things, exhibits on naval history including several detailed models of 18th century ships. The second floor includes exhibits on Swedish commercial fleets. In the basement is a replica of a cabin in King Gustav III's ship Amphion, along with the original stern from the ship.  Listing of historical ships  The Maritime Museum is responsible for the listing of historical ships in Sweden. Both ships and pleasure boats of historical significance can be listed. While the listing offers no legal protection or obligations, it gives the owner of the craft certain privileges.  Architecture  The gently curved building, inspired by the neoclassicist design of Olof Tempelman (1746–1816), acts as a background for the surrounding park where open-air concerts are held each year. It was the last major commission of Ragnar Östberg and was built on the location for the Stockholm Exhibition (1930) (Stockholmsutställningen 1930). As the exhibition was an important Functionalism manifestation, the museum also mark the point of view of the architect in the debate the introduction of Functionalist style caused in Sweden. The central cupola is entirely built of brick. The building also houses a model workshop, wood shop, photo studio, archives and a library. In the 1970s, a film and lecture hall was added and in the 1990s a café. Outside of the museum is a bronze statue called The Sailor (Sjömannen), a memorial to the Swedish sailors who died during World War II. The statue was made by artist Nils Sjögren in 1952, just before he died. The statue was inaugurated in 1953.  Concerts  The Dagens Nyheter concert in 2014 Starting in 1975, open-air concerts and music festivals are held in the park in front of the museum. The annual concerts arranged by the newspaper Dagens Nyheter with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra are compared with, and inspired by, The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall. Among the other artists who have performed at events held at the museum are Oasis, Lisa Nilsson, Kent, Pearl Jam, Sarah Dawn Finer, Axwell, and Per Gessle.

Aubrey Smith. The production's screenplay, written by Claude Binyon, is about a stenographer who becomes a famous café entertainer courted by an English aristocrat and an American newspaper reporter. Released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on January 25, 1935, the film is one of the English language films chosen by the National Board of Review for its top-10 list of 1935. The Gilded Lily is also the first of seven films in which Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray costar. Plot still from film Stenographer Marilyn David (Claudette Colbert) and newspaper reporter Peter Dawes (Fred MacMurray) meet every Thursday on a bench outside the New York Public Library to eat popcorn and watch the world go by. One day, Peter confesses his love to her, but she tells him she only considers him a friend—that someday she will find love when she meets the right man. Afterwards on the subway, Marilyn meets a wealthy English aristocrat, Lord Charles Gray Granton (Ray Milland), who is visiting New York incognito as a commoner. After she helps him escape a confrontation with a subway guard, he walks her home and the two flirt with each other. He does not tell her that his father is the Duke of Loamshire, nor does he mention that he is engaged to an Englishwoman. In the coming days they go on dates to Coney Island and have dinner together, and soon they fall in love. At their next Thursday meeting, Marilyn reveals to Peter that she has fallen in love with someone. Disappointed, he tells her that things can never be the same between them, but assures her that she can always depend on his friendship. When Charles' father, Lloyd Granton (C. Aubrey Smith), learns that his son intends to propose to an American girl, he insists that they first return to England to break off his current engagement properly. Charles visits Marilyn before he leaves and—still not revealing his identity—tells her that he found a job and will be out of town on business for a few weeks. The next day, Peter learns from his editor that the Duke of Loamshire and his son have been in New York for six weeks without the press being aware of it, and are preparing to sail back for England. While working on his usual shipping news column at the docks, Peter spots Duke Granton and his son Charles boarding a ship. After a brief interview, the duke gives Peter $100 to keep their names out of the newspapers. Annoyed at the duke's arrogance, Peter publishes his column the following day, complete with a photo of the Grantons. When Marilyn sees that her \\"Charles\\" is in fact Lord Granton returning to England to marry his English fiancé—at least according to Peter's story—she rushes to her friend heartbroken and reveals that Charles is the man she's been dating. Believing that Charles was simply using her, Peter writes a fictitious article about Marilyn, whom he calls the \\"No\\" Girl, turning down Lord Granton's marriage proposal and deciding to hold out for true love instead. The story causes an immediate scandal and generates sympathy for Marilyn who becomes an overnight celebrity. Meanwhile on the ship, the Grantons are informed of the scandal and that Charles' fiancé has broken her engagement. Convinced that Marilyn is attempting to blackmail him, Charles sends her a telegram asking how much money she wants in return for her silence. That night while comforting Marilyn over drinks at the Gingham Café, Peter decides to capitalize on the publicity and her newfound celebrity. He works out a deal with the owner who gives Marilyn a job as a singer and dancer at the café—even though she cannot sing or dance. After a few singing and dancing lessons and a massive promotional campaign, Marilyn opens to a packed house. Despite her lack of talent, her self-effacing manner wins laughs from the audience who are completely won over by her innocence and charm. Through Peter's clever management and publicity stunts, the \\"No\\" Girl becomes a household name and a nightclub star, with her image appearing on billboards, posters, and front page newspaper articles across the country. Despite her fame and popularity, Marilyn is unable to forget her feelings for Charles. Believing that if she sees him again she'll get over him, Marilyn travels to London to perform her nightclub act. During one performance, she sees Charles in the audience; after sharing a romantic dance together, they agree to renew their relationship. A brokenhearted Peter graciously bows out of her life and returns to America so she can be happy. Later he sends her a box of popcorn as a reminder of their friendship. Meanwhile, life with Charles is not as perfect as she had envisioned. He seems more interested in her celebrity than in their love. When Charles invites her to go away with him to the country for a week—implying she is someone with loose morals—she assembles the press and announces that she's \\"going home to sit on a bench and eat popcorn\\". Back in New York on a snowy Thursday night, Marilyn rushes through crowds of her admirers and makes her way to the library bench. Peter soon arrives with his popcorn, takes Marilyn in his arms, and kisses her passionately.

It was used in the Hadhramaut and also the area round the Hadhramite capital of Shabwah, in what is now Yemen. The Hadramites also controlled the trade in frankincense through their important trading post of Sumhuram (Hadramautic ), now Khor Rori in the Dhofar Governorate, Oman. Script and phonology Almost the entire body of evidence for the ancient Ḥaḑramautic language comes from inscriptions written in the monumental Old South Arabian script, consisting of 29 letters, and deriving from the Proto-Sinaitic script. The sounds of the language were essentially the same as those of Sabaean (see Sabaean language). Noteworthy characteristics of Ḥaḑramautic include its tendency, especially in inscriptions actually from Wādī Ḥaḑramawt itself, to represent Old South Arabian ṯ as s3: thus we find s2ls3 (\\"three\\"; cf. Sabaean s2lṯ.)Leonid E. Kogan and Andrey Korotayev: Sayhadic (Epigraphic South Arabian). In: The Semitic Languages, edited by Robert Hetzron.Pg. 223. Routledge, London, 1997. There are also instances where ṯ is written for an older form s3; e.g. Ḥaḑramautic mṯnad (\\"inscription\\"), which is msnd in the rest of Old South Arabian.Leonid E. Kogan and Andrey Korotayev: Sayhadic (Epigraphic South Arabian). In: The Semitic Languages, edited by Robert Hetzron. Pg. 223. Routledge, London, 1997. History Potsherds with Old South Arabian letters on them, found in Raybūn, the old Ḥaḑramite capital, have been radiocarbon dated to the 12th century BC.Leonid E. Kogan and Andrey Korotayev: Sayhadic (Epigraphic South Arabian). In: The Semitic Languages, edited by Robert Hetzron.Pg. 220. Routledge, London, 1997. The language was certainly in use from 800 BC but in the 4th century AD the Ḥaḑramite Kingdom was conquered by the Ḥimyarites, who used Sabaean as an official language, and since then there are no more records in Ḥaḑramautic. During the course of the language’s history there appeared particular phonetic changes, such as the change from ˤ to ˀ, from ẓ to ṣ, from ṯ to s3. As in other Semitic languages n can be assimilated to a following consonant, compare ʾnfs1 \\"souls\\" > ʾfs1 In Ḥaḑramautic the third person pronouns begin with s1. It has feminine forms ending in ṯ and s3. References Bibliography *Leonid Kogan and Andrey Korotayev: Sayhadic Languages (Epigraphic South Arabian). Semitic Languages.

He was Minister-President of Flanders from 2007 until 2014 and was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Employment in the government of Prime Minister Charles Michel.  Early life and education  At the left, next to Piet Vanthemsche. After attending secondary school in Boom, Peeters studied law in Antwerp and obtained a law degree in 1986. In addition, he obtained a degree in taxation and accounting from Vlerick Business School in Ghent.  Career  Peeters served from 1991 to 1994 as Director of the NCMV research department. In 1994 he became Secretary-General of NCMV and when NCMV was reformed into the SME interest group UNIZO in 1999, he became its first managing director. In 2004, although not having been a candidate for public office at the 2004 regional elections, Peeters was asked to become a member of the Flemish Government. He resigned his position with UNIZO and became Flemish Minister for Public Works, Energy, the Environment and Nature. During the 2006 municipal elections, Peeters ran for public office the first time in his career and was elected a member of the city council of his home town Puurs. In the 2007 Belgian federal elections, Peeters was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives but chose not to take his seat, instead he succeeded Yves Leterme as Minister-President of Flanders, as Leterme headed the CD&V; coalition talks for a new Belgian government.(Dutch) Peeters also gave up his former competences to Hilde Crevits and took on the responsibilities for Institutional Affairs, Agriculture and Sea Fisheries, formerly belonging to Leterme, while keeping his own competence regarding Ports. He has been serving a second term as head of the Flemish government since the regional elections of 7 June 2009, with the additional competences of Institutional Affairs, Economy, Agriculture and Sea Fisheries. During the 2014 Belgian government formation Peeters was co-formateur along with Charles Michel (MR). Peeters was poised to become the new Prime Minister of Belgium. However, upon nominating Marianne Thyssen (also CD&V;) as European Commissioner, his party already held a major political office. Consequently, Charles Michel became Prime Minister, and Kris Peeters became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Employment, Economy and Consumer Affairs in the Michel Government.

As part of a large fur-trader family of French and Sioux origins, he was an unlikely candidate for Chief of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate. However, with the coming of the Dakota War of 1862, his fortunes changed. Thanks to his family's connections, he obtained in 1863 the post of Chief of Scouts in the service of Minnesota state militia Colonel Henry Hastings Sibley--later to become the first governor of the state of Minnesota. His service to the U.S. Army ended in 1865. For his military service, he was appointed by Sibley as Chief of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate in 1866. His people seconded Sibley's appointment a year later by declaring Renville chief-for-life. His tenure as chief saw the creation and settlement of his people on the Lake Traverse Reservation. He is buried atop a bluff near Old Agency, South Dakota. Gabriel Renville was born in April 1825 to Winona Crawford (1805-1897) and Victor Renville (died 1833).

They help children overcome poverty and become leaders in their own communities. NPH is fully supporting nearly 3,100 boys and girls in Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru. An additional 3,200 community children receive scholarships, meals, health care and other support. More than 114,000 services were provided through community outreach programs in 2018. History In 1954, a hungry, homeless boy was arrested for stealing from the poor box of a small church in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The church's priest, Father William Wasson of Phoenix, Arizona, refused to press charges and asked for custody of the boy. Within a few days, eight more boys found a home with Father Wasson. He gave them a safe environment and a chance to turn their lives around. By year's end, 32 boys were in his care and Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos was born. Father Wasson's devotion to the care of orphans inspired an outpouring of financial support and volunteer helpers for his humanitarian cause. NPH USA traces its roots to Father Wasson's family and friends in Arizona, who sent clothes, food and money. In 1965, Friends of Our Little Brothers was incorporated in Arizona as a nonprofit organization. Affiliated but separate nonprofit support groups called NPH USA were created in Minnesota (1986), Washington (1988) and Illinois (1999). An organization in Virginia, called Our Little Brothers and Sisters (OLB&S;), helped start fundraising offices in Europe as well as Canada. On July 1, 2005, the offices in Arizona, Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington State became regional offices of the national organization – NPH USA. In addition, new regional offices were formed in Florida and Virginia. The new offices were made possible by the fundraising support of OLB&S.; Philosophy Children at NPH homes – called pequeños – are not available for adoption; instead they form a part of a larger, stable, permanent family environment at the homes, giving them a chance to focus on education and personal growth. They are taught the values of work, sharing and responsibility in a Christian environment. Each has the opportunity to finish a technical course or seek a university degree. All children are asked to give back a year or more of service to NPH. Through this act of gratitude, each graduate shares the responsibility of raising the family. Pequeños have the goal of becoming contributing, self-sufficient and caring citizens in their own countries. Former pequeños are educators, doctors, accountants, carpenters, farmers, mechanics, artists, administrators and social workers. Some work for NPH, while others support NPH USA and NPH by sponsoring children, organizing fundraisers, or attending special events and serving as ambassadors for the organization. All of the NPH homes strive to be self- sufficient and most operate their own schools, clinics, gardens and farms. For example, at NPH Honduras, all of the fixtures and furniture, as well as most of the clothes and shoes used by the children, are made by pequeños in vocational workshops, while NPH Mexico produces enough livestock, fish, fruits and vegetables to satisfy most of the children's needs. What the homes are unable to provide internally is donated by supporters from around the world. 2010 Haiti earthquake relief As a result of the 7.0 earthquake on January 12, 2010, NPH USA and NPH/NPFS suffered the tragic loss of staff, volunteers and family members, and extensive damage to its facilities. Despite these losses, thousands of victims received aid immediately and continue to be helped through various programs, including: St. Hélène Orphanage for Children, a permanent home to 400 children. Over 200 external students from the community attend the on-site school. Children displaced by the earthquake are being integrated into the home. St. Don Bosco, which supports roughly 250 children and youths from St. Hélène who now live with extended family or in group homes and attend secondary school, including a vocational school. The future site of the Don Bosco school and student dorms is located in Tabarre, near the hospital. St. Damien Hospital, serving as a hub for trauma care for earthquake-related injuries as well as maternity care. It also have become one of the premier orthopedic medical centers within Haiti. Teams of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals from all over the world arrived to help care for the wounded. Within the first three weeks, the hospital attended to over 10,000 adults and children. Teams also distributed emergency aid of food and water to numerous tent cities. St. Anne, a rented temporary home for up to 40 children age 6 and under. It was established in response to the thousands of children left homeless by the earthquake. St. Louis, a temporary child protection camp for over 120 vulnerable and displaced children. The camp, located in Tabarre, is constructed out of shipping containers. Capacity of the camp will eventually be 350. Father Wasson Angels of Light, an emergency response program for children living in tent cities. This day camp provides educational activities and meals for 2,500 children. Youths who grew up at NPH/NPFS help coordinate the various programs. The program plans to open a primary school for 700 students and offer about 60 jobs. St. Germaine Rehabilitation Center, providing physical therapy, a special needs school and a meal program. A prosthetics lab and physical therapy program for amputees began shortly after the earthquake. The St. Luke Foundation, developed to manage numerous outreach programs in the poorest areas surrounding Port-au- Prince. An affiliate of NPH/NPFS, the foundation's most recent project is an adult hospital that was opened right after the earthquake. Additional programs include schools, clinics, food and water distribution, and dignified burials. St. Francisville, a facility that produces a variety of goods, including cement blocks, cobblestones, bread and pasta. There are also workshops for automotive mechanics, sewing, printing and digital production. The goods and services are used by NPFS and St. Luke as well as external organizations. Following the earthquake, bread production was accelerated to 5,000 rolls daily and the buildings were used as a warehouse distribution center. Organizational structure President and Chief Executive Officer: John Deinhart NPH USA is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. In addition, each of the six regional offices has its own volunteer Board of Directors. Board members have diverse professional backgrounds and expertise, but each actively works to raise funds for and awareness of NPH USA. The national office is located in Chicago. Relationship with NPH There is close collaboration and cooperation between NPH USA and NPH. NPH USA is a fundraising organization whose primary function is to provide financial support to raise, nurture and educate children living at NPH homes. In the process, NPH USA staff meet on a regular basis with NPH leadership to review programs, approve budgets, plan tours to homes, arrange fundraising events, and support other NPH activities. NPH USA representatives visit the homes in order to experience NPH programs first-hand. Pequeños also make annual visits to the United States to perform at NPH USA-sponsored events where they bring the message of hope to a wider audience. Financial Information According to NPH USA's 2018 financial statements, 78% of their financial resources were spent on programs, with 22% going to administration and fundraising. In 2018, they raised a total of $19.1 million in donor contributions. Out of this amount, $17 million was received in the form of cash and $2.1 million in the form of donated goods – primarily medicine and medical supplies. This level of donor support allowed NPH USA to in-turn provide NPH International with $15.3 million of funding for programs benefiting children and their families. Accountability standards A report issued by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) Wise Giving Alliance in February 2010 found that NPH USA met all BBB standards for charity accountability, governance, expenditures, veracity, and public disclosure. Audited financial statements are available upon request and IRS Form 990s are posted on the NPH USA web site.

The Univision Radio outlet broadcasts at 104.3 MHz with an ERP of 48,000 watts and is licensed to Taylor, Texas. Its transmitter is located in Coupland, Texas, and the station has studios along MoPac Expressway in Northwest Austin. History =As \\"The Beat 104.3\\" (1st phase, KQBT)= KLQB was launched as KQBT on 104.3 FM (licensed to Taylor, Texas) in June 1998 after the frequency would be moved southward to the Austin area after previously serving the Temple-Killeen market as KKIK.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-06-12.pdf Soon enough, KQBT, with the branding [The] Beat 104.3, began targeting Austin in 1998 as a Rhythmic contemporary hits station, playing Hip Hop, R&B;, some Pop, and some Dance. At the time, the station complemented the then co-owned Urban AC station KJCE \\"K-Juice 1370\\" (now a talk radio station). This would eventually propel KQBT as one of Austin's Top 5 radio stations (sometimes #1) according to Arbitron ratings. By 2001, the station dropped Dance music and eventually Pop music from the playlist and has gone straight Hip Hop and R&B.; KQBT was in initial competition with Top 40 rival KHFI (of which it first challenged) and Rhythmic Oldies-turned-AC rival KFMK-FM (launched a year after KQBT); it gained direct competition from KDHT (now KGSR) in 2003. =As KOYT \\"104.3 The Coyote\\"= In 2004, Howard Stern was expected back on the radio due in several markets due to Clear Channel firing him for indecency. KQBT, along with five other replacement radio stations owned by what was then called Infinity Broadcasting (which owned Stern's show through syndication), was selected to carry the morning drive. As a result, there would be uncertainty that the Hip Hop/R&B; format would even survive with Stern on the air, so the frequency flipped to talk radio, changed calls to KOYT and called itself 104.3 The Coyote on July 19, 2004.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2004/RR-2004-07-23.pdf In addition to Stern, KOYT's lineup consisted of Don & Mike, Russ Martin, Tom Leykis, and The John and Jeff Show, as well as programming from All-Comedy Radio. However, the talk format did not do well at all in the market. =As \\"Beat 104.3\\" (2nd phase, KXBT)= With the failure of KOYT, the frequency returned to a Rhythmic Contemporary Hits format six months later on January 21, 2005, under the former branding Beat 104.3 but with new call letters KXBT because KQBT was already assigned to a radio station in Llano, Texas (they are now on a radio station in Houston).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-01-28.pdf Even though it was a Rhythmic, this time KXBT skewed slightly towards an unofficial Mainstream Urban format, unusual for the market's demographics given the fact less than 10% of the Austin radio market's population is African American. To accommodate the return, the station held a campaign in early 2005 to \\"Make The Big Switch Back to the Beat,\\" with the slogan at the time being \\"The People's Station\\" before finally settling on \\"The Beat of the ATX.\\" It became home for a short time to the controversial Star and Buc Wild Morning Show from December 2005 to May 2006. Soon after the return to the format, KXBT reintroduced Freestyle Dance music and added more Reggaeton music. =As KLQB \\"La Que Buena\\"= In 2006, CBS Radio sold the Austin radio cluster (also including KAMX, KKMJ and KJCE) to Entercom. On February 21, 2007, Entercom announced that the 104.3 frequency and KXBT calls would be sold to Univision and change to a Spanish format on February 26. The staff was already told of this stunning news before it was made public in the trades and was expecting to leave prior to the flip. Albeit that Univision owned Hip Hop music stations in San Antonio, Houston, the Rio Grande Valley and Albuquerque at the time, the Austin cluster of Univision did not retain the format. After the announcement was made, Border Media flipped KXXS to a Rhythmic Top 40 format, hired the former KXBT staff, and relaunched as \\"The Beat 104.9\\", thus leaving the station virtually intact.

Born in Dublin, Fallon played both hurling and Gaelic football with his local club, St Vincents. He won an All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship with Vincents as a used sub in 2008. At senior inter-county level, Fallon played exclusively with the Dublin hurlers from 2003 to 2010. During this time, he established himself as one of the best centre-backs in the country which culminated in him winning a Vodafone GAA All Stars of the Month award in March 2007 and being nominated for an All Stars Award in 2008. Hurling career =Club= Fallon plays hurling with the famous St Vincents club in Marino, Dublin. While he has never won a Dublin Senior Hurling Championship title with them, he has been a runner-up on three occasions. He played in his first county final in 2005 against UCD, losing by a scoreline 3–13 to 2–10. Fallon reached county final with Vincents again in 2007 when they lost to Ballyboden St Endas by 2–13 to 1–5. He suffered another heavy defeat to Ballyboden in the 2010 final, this time losing by a scoreline of 3–17 to 1–10. =Inter-county= Fallon made his debut for the Dublin senior hurlers in a National League game against Kilkenny in 2003. Earlier that year, he was a substitute on the Dublin team that beat Kilkenny in the Walsh Cup final at Parnell Park by 2–11 to 2–10. This was an unusual start to any Dublin hurlers career as it was Dublin's' first piece of hurling silverware since 1966. In 2005, Dublin were relegated to Division 2 of the National Hurling League after finishing at the bottom of the table in Division 1. The following year, Dublin gained promotion back to Division 1 when they won their first ever Division 2 title, beating Kerry in the final by 0–16 to 0–6. While Fallon was not to win any more silverware with the Dubs thereafter, he made a name for himself at inter-county level as an impressive centre-back, receiving many individual accolades. He was named at centre-back on the 2006 and 2007 Dublin Blue Stars teams and won a Vodafone GAA All Stars of the Month award in March 2007, having led Dublin at centre-back to victories over Galway and Limerick in the League, thus securing their Division 1 status for the following year. That same year at the inaugural awards ceremony hosted by Friends of Dublin Hurling, Fallon was chosen as Dublin Senior Player of the Year. In 2008, he was nominated for an All Stars Award. Fallon missed Dublin's championship campaign in 2009 after he sustained a broken metatarsal against Kilkenny in the National Hurling League. After returning from injury, Fallon failed to break into Anthony Daly's championship line-up and retired in 2010. =Inter-provincial= In 2008, Fallon was selected at centre-back for the Leinster provincial team. In their first game, they beat Connacht in the semi- final of the Railway Cup. In the final in Portlaoise, Leinster faced a Munster team that was bidding for a three-in-a-row. Leinster beat them by 1–15 to 1–12, winning Fallon his first and only Railway Cup medal. Football career =Club= Fallon played football at senior level with St Vincents for many years. In 2006, one year after he lost to UCD in his first hurling county final, he faced the students again, this time in his first football county final. Once more, UCD were victorious, beating Vincents by 0–10 to 0–9. In 2007, Fallon won his first Dublin Senior Football Championship title with Vincents as an unused sub when they beat St Brigids by 0–12 to 1–7. They then went on to win a Leinster Senior Club Football Championship in December of that year, beating Tyrrellspass of Westmeath by 2–8 to 0–7, although Fallon did not take part in this game either. This qualified Vincents for the All- Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, which they had not won since 1985. On Saint Patrick's Day, 17 March 2008, they played Nemo Rangers of Cork in the final in Croke Park, whom they had previously lost to in the final in 1973. However, Vincents were to be victorious on this occasion, beating Nemo by 1–11 to 0–13. Fallon came on as a substitute for Hugh Gill after 58 minutes, winning him his first and only All-Ireland medal. =Inter-county= Fallon never competed at senior level for the Dublin footballers, but was a dual player for Dublin up to under-21 level. He was on the starting panel that won the Leinster Under-21 Football Championship when they beat Kildare by 0–13 to 0–11 in 2005.

His research was the gateway for many later discoveries about the cell cycle, cell division, and many other areas in cell biology.  Biography  Mazia grew up in Scranton, Philadelphia, in a Russian-Jewish family. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1933 and a Ph.D. in 1937 from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1937–38, he was a National Research Council fellow at Princeton University and at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Here, he worked with sea urchins which were the organism he focused on in his doctoral research. He then joined the zoology faculty of the University of Missouri, where he taught from 1938 to 1950. During the first few months of his job there, he served in the United States Army throughout World War II. In 1938, he married Gertrude Greenblatt and had two children, Judith and Rebecca. From 1951 until his retirement in 1979, he was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught Physical Chemical Biology for much of his stint as a professor at Berkeley. Due to his profound research in Woods Hole, many graduate students as well as postdoctoral students flooded his laboratory in California. After leaving Berkeley until his death in 1996, Mazia was an emeritus professor at Stanford University. He died of heart failure and complications due to cancer.  Research  = Isolating the mitotic spindle = Mazia's research focused mainly on processes of mitosis , and was the first to isolate a spindle apparatus from a cell undergoing cell division. This research was done in conjunction with Katsuma Dan where they completed the first successful isolation of a mitotic apparatus from sea urchin eggs. This was a discovery that shocked the cell biology community. This discovery ended doubt of what the apparatus looked like, as well as opened a variety of new questions about the makeup of the apparatus, and how the appearance and disappearance of the structure was controlled. He never lost interest in the apparatus, and continued to research it throughout his career. = Other Research = Mazia's doctoral research worked mainly with sea urchins, and focused on the calcium ions involved in cell regulation. He introduced many ideas about a free calcium during fertilisation, which linked the idea that redistributing Ca2+ ions help to activate the egg to form the offspring. When he went to work with the University of Missouri, his research focused on the structure of the nucleus. After his retirement from Berkeley, he went to work for Stanford University at the Hopkins Marine Station, where he researched the structure and replication of the centrosomal complex and proposed ideas as to how it might function as a regulator of cell structure. Some other research was focused on the cell theory in which he concluded that the eukaryotic cell is a whole unit in which the structure contains the basic needs of living for any unit.  Accomplishments  Mazia was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the E. B. Wilson Medal in 1981 for his contributions to cell biology along with George Emil Palade and Keith R. Porter.

The body is yellowish-grey to brown or dark grey, with numerous black spots, so that the slug may appear to be evenly black-brown, slightly lighter at the sides. The animal is very slender, gradually narrowing posteriorly. The mantle length is less than 1/3 of the body length. There are blurry black bands on the sides of the mantle. The keel is prominent, light, and reaches the mantle. The head and neck are blackish. The sole is narrow and cream with brown or orange hue. The body mucus is usually colourless, thick and sticky but it is yellowish when the slug is irritated. The length is up to 70 mm. The length of a preserved specimen is 30–40 mm. Reproductive system: The penis is rounded, wider than and approximately as long as the epiphallus. The vas deferens opening is clearly asymmetrically at the posterior end of epiphallus. Therer is a small simple papilla inside the penis. The spermatheca duct is usually thick; the vagina and atrium are short, the vagina accessory glands are two lobe-like objects connected to the vagina by thin ducts. The spermatophore is thin, 16 mm long, covered almost entirely with short spines. Distribution This slug is native to Europe.

Habitat This slug mainly lives in secondary, anthropogenous (man-made) habitats, such as farmland.Janus, Horst (1965). The young specialist looks at land and freshwater molluscs, Burke, London. The habitat of Tandonia budapestensis includes parks, gardens, ruins and cultivated fields. It lives as a synanthrope. It occur in natural environments in Britain only where human disturbance is involved. In south Bulgaria it is found usually between 300 and 1000 m, but locally up to 2200 m. It requires humidity and is active at night. It buries into heavy soils. This species is widespread in some countries and it is still spreading in the British Isles. The biology of the species was reviewed by Reise et al. (2006). In Britain the copulation of this slug species takes place from November to January; in Central Europe from April to autumn. Slugs may copulate several times in their life. Copulation begins usually at night and may last 15 hours or more; everted genitalia are visible between the partners. In Britain, juveniles hatch in April or May, and maturity is reached in the autumn. Up to more than 20 eggs are laid at a time. In Central Europe, eggs, sub-adults and adults pass the winter. Human relevance This species is noxious to crops, in lowland England particularly to potatoes. This species is a pest in crops of root vegetables.

He was the brother of Jack Kelly (Olympic Gold Medalist and father of actress Grace Kelly) and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright George Kelly. Kelly toured for years as The Virginia Judge, and was sometimes credited as Walter \\"Judge\\" Kelly. Although Kelly did a number of different Southern dialects playing the various characters in his \\"Virginian Judge\\" sketches, an Irish flavor sometimes sneaked through. In one such sketch where three men appear before the Judge for \\"disturbin' the peace and quarrelin' on the highway\\", the word \\"highway\\" came through as very Irish. Most of his sketches, however, were racist humor at the expense of African- Americans, which reflected his personal feelings. For instance, in 1908 Bert Williams and George Walker, then starring in the successful Broadway production Bandanna Land, were asked to appear at a charity benefit by George M. Cohan. Kelly protested and encouraged the other acts to withdraw from the show rather than appear alongside black performers; only two of the acts joined Kelly's boycott. Kelly released five recordings of his act on Victor Records and also appeared in several Broadway productions himself.

Realizing that the sender of the cards intends for Ed to involve himself with the three people, Ed researches Milla's history and discovers that she is waiting for her husband who died sixty years ago during World War II, so he pretends to be Jimmy and comes to read to her weekly. For Sophie, he raises her spirits by giving her an empty shoe box to encourage her to try running barefoot at her next competition; although she loses again, she still finds pride in her achievement. Ed is initially unsure how to approach the rapist, until he receives a gun in the mail, which he uses to kidnap the man and threaten him to leave the city and never return. After finishing the Ace of Diamonds, two masked men break into his house, assault him, and leave him a congratulatory letter as well as an Ace of Clubs with a vague clue. The next day, Ed reveals to Audrey his involvement in the cards, before telling her that he wishes the two of them could be together, but Audrey declines him. Eventually, Ed picks up a man in his cab who tells him to drive to the river before leading Ed on a chase to a rock formation on which the three names are written for Ed to \\"solve.\\" The first is Thomas O'Reilly, a pastor in a run- down area of the city with a dwindling congregation; Ed helps him by organizing and advertising for a party with free beer in order to encourage everyone to come on Sunday. The next, Angie Carusso, is a single mother who Ed witnesses buying ice cream for her children, and he buys her one as well to show that she is appreciated. Finally, Gavin Rose is a young boy who constantly fights his brother, so Ed beats up Gavin in order to encourage the brother to take revenge, which they do one night by assaulting Ed and cementing their brotherhood. After participating in a yearly football game, Ed's dog is stolen and he has to buy it back from a boy, who also gives him the Ace of Spades, on which are three names of famous authors. After trying to kiss Audrey one day and being gently rejected again, he goes to the library and eventually realizes that the street names come from parts of the title, with notes written on certain page numbers for specific addresses. The first, Glory Road, has Lua Tatupu, whose family has decorated their home for Christmas with strings of broken lights, so Ed buys new ones for them and sets them up himself. On Clown Street, Ed runs into his mother on a date, and he eventually drives to her house and confronts her about her disdain for him before reconciling. Finally, on Bell Street he meets an old man named Bernie Price who runs an antiquated theater. Ed brings Audrey there to watch Cool Hand Luke and invites Bernie to watch it with them, but eventually the screen cuts to videos of Ed performing his tasks so far. Ed finds the Ace of Hearts on his seat in the theater, on which is written three movie titles. After consulting with Bernie, he realizes that they are references to his three friends Ritchie, Marv, and Audrey. He talks to Ritchie late one night and the two stand in a river for an hour, as Ed encourages him to search for something he cares about. Afterwards, Ed, confused by Marv's stinginess, asks him for a loan as a ploy, causing Marv to reveal that he has been saving money to care for a child he had with a girl named Suzanne Boyd who moved away after she became pregnant years ago. After discussing it, Ed convinces him to travel to her house, and although Suzanne's father angrily claims that he brought shame upon the family, the two eventually reconcile and Marv is reconnected with Suzanne and their daughter. Finally, Ed comes to Audrey early one morning and dances with her for three minutes to show his love for her, hoping that she can love him back. Upon returning elatedly to his place, he finds a Joker with his own address written on it, which bothers him greatly because he assumed he had finished. One day a man enters his cab and asks him to drive to every address he has been to so far, taking him on a tour of his accomplishments, before revealing that he was the robber, who asks Ed if he still sees \\"a dead man\\" when he looks in the mirror, before telling him to go back home. Inside is a man who claims responsibility for the entire series of events, before handing him a folder that details all of Ed's adventures. In a postmodern twist, the man is strongly implied to be Markus Zusak himself, who has written Ed's story right down to the current discussion they are having. He leaves Ed to consider the philosophical implications, and Ed stays inside for days before Audrey comes one afternoon and asks to stay with him for good. They kiss and Ed explains everything to her, before realizing that the story he resides in is actually a reminder to others of their true potential, ending with \\"'I'm not the messenger at all.

Taxonomy When Wiktor (1966) described D. praecox he distinguished two forms on the basis of their genitalia. Later Wiktor (1973) realised that one of the forms of D. praecox that he had distinguished was synonymous with Deroceras rodnae, described slightly earlier by Grossu & Lupu (1965). But the other form with a spiral end to its penis occupied a distinct range in the Sudeten mountains and neighboring areas; this is what is called D. praecox nowadays. It remains debatable whether D. praecox might be better viewed as a subspecies of D. rodnae (Hutchinson & Reise, 2009). Note that the distinct differences in mating behaviour between D. praecox and D. rodnae that Reise (1995) reported turn out to refer to differences between D. praecox and a more distant species, Deroceras juranum (Hutchinson & Reise, 2009). Description Another view of Deroceras praecox The coloration of the body of this slug is usually snowy white or off-white mottled with grey (Wiktor, 2000). The head and tentacles are brownish. However, colour is often a misleading guide and identification should be based on dissection. Even within a site D. praecox may co-occur with other species that are indistinguishable externally (Reise & Hutchinson, 2001). Deroceras praecox is distinct in having a spiral pocket at the end of its penis . Distribution This species occurs in Eastern Europe.

It is an \\"activated\\" form of palmitic acid and can be transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the carnitine shuttle system (which transports fatty acyl-CoA molecules into the mitochondria), and once inside can participate in β-oxidation. Alternatively, palmitoyl-CoA is used as a substrate in the biosynthesis of sphingosine (this biosynthetic pathway does not require transfer into the mitochonidria).  Biosynthesis  Palmitoyl CoA formed from palmitic acid, in the reaction below. Palmitate + CoA-SH + ATP -> Palmitoyl-CoA + AMP + Pyrophosphate This reaction is often referred to as the \\"activation\\" of a fatty acid. The activation is catalyzed by palmitoyl-coenzyme A synthetase and the reaction proceeds through a two step mechanism, in which palmitoyl-AMP is an intermediate. The reaction is driven to completion by the exergonic hydrolysis of pyrophosphate. The activation of fatty acids occurs in the cytosol and beta-oxidation occurs in the mitochondria. However, long chain fatty acyl-CoA cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane. If palmitoyl-CoA is to enter the mitchondria, it must react with carnitine in order to be transported across: Palmitoyl-CoA + Carnitine <-> Palmitoyl-Carnitine + CoA-SH This transesterification reaction is catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyl transferase. Palmitoyl-Carnitine may translocate across the membrane, and once on matrix side, the reaction proceeds in reverse as CoA-SH is recombined with palmitoyl- CoA, and released. Unattached carnitine is then shuttled back to the cytosolic side of mitochondrial membrane.  Beta-Oxidation  Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, palmitoyl-CoA may undergo β-oxidation. The full oxidation of palmitic acid (or palmitoyl-CoA) results in 8 acetyl-CoA's, 7 NADH, 7 , and 7 FADH2. The full reaction is below: Palmitoyl-CoA +7CoA-SH + 7NAD+ + 7FAD -> 8Acetyl-CoA + 7NADH + 7H+ + 7FADH2  Sphingolipid Biosynthesis  Palmitoyl-CoA is also the starting substrate, along with Serine, for sphingolipid biosynthesis. Palmitoyl CoA and Serine participate in a condensation reaction catalyzed by serine C-palmitoyltransferase (SPT), in which 3-ketosphinganine is formed. These reactions occur in the cytosol. alt= Additional images Image:Sphk1 diag b.jpgSynthesis Image:Palmitic acid.pngPalmitic acid Image:Coenzym A.svgCoenzyme A References Category:Thioesters of coenzyme A Category:Organophosphates Category:Palmitate esters ","title":"Palmitoyl-CoA"},{"id":"9816662","text":"Connaught Hospital is the principal adult referral hospital in Sierra Leone.

Character history Hannah is the mother of the late Ethan Cambias, a child conceived of a teenage love affair with Zach Slater, then known as Alexander Cambias, Jr. Upon giving birth to Ethan, she gives him up and he is adopted by Stanley and Edith Ramsey. Hannah comes to Pine Valley, but as time goes on, she realizes how much she missed when she gave Ethan up for adoption. She sleeps with Josh Madden in her office at Cambias, and starts a short relationship with him. She then makes a pregnancy plea to Zach, saying he owes her, and leaves Pine Valley afterwards. It is later confirmed that Zach did not grant her plea. After returning to Pine Valley, Hannah starts working on an assignment given to her by Adam Chandler, pointed against Zach's company, but she later regrets doing it. With Adam blackmailing her, Hannah works to get Adam his company back from Zach. She steals the company from Zach while he is preocuppied with getting Kendall Hart's legal affairs in order. She then gives Adam back his company and breaks off any relationship with him. After hearing about Kendall being given community service for her wrongdoings, Hannah attempts to shoot her while she is partying at Greenlee Smythe's apartment. While her bullet misses Kendall, Ryan Lavery is hit instead. With Zach searching for Hannah, she runs into Sean Montgomery, whom she takes back to her hotel room and sleeps with. She then goes off to the cliffs (the same cliffs where Leo du Pres and Vanessa Bennett died) where Zach meets her. She shares with Zach memories of his father raping her when Zach was off to school. Zach tries to comfort her, but she steps away from him and both slip at the edge of the cliff, now hanging on for life. Zach vows to save her and asks her to hold on to him tightly. Aidan Devane, Kendall and Greenlee rush to where the two are and try to pull them up to safety. As Zach tells Hannah that he is sorry for the awful things that happened to her and to please believe him, Hannah makes it clear that she does. Zach professes his love to a frantic Kendall to calm her down, and as he does, Hannah tells Zach that it is okay, seemingly realizing how deep his love for Kendall goes. She keeps looking down, surmising the situation. As if sensing that they will both die if they go any longer in their current state, she says that everything is as it should be and lets go, presumably falling to her death. Zach is pulled to safety, distraught over the one woman he could not save.

Carlisle was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in Yorkshire, England.Walter Carlisle. Batting and fielding statistics. Baseball Reference. Retrieved on May 19, 2019. In a three-game career, Carlisle was a .100 hitter (1-for-10) with one stolen base and no home runs. While playing in the Pacific Coast League for the Vernon Tigers, Carlisle executed an unassisted triple play against Los Angeles Angels. With the score tied at 3–3 in the sixth inning, and runners on first and second bases, Carlisle made a diving catch of a short fly batted by Roy Akin; stepped on second to retire Charlie Moore, and tagged George Metzger coming from first. The Tigers won the game, 5–4. With his heroic feat, Carlisle entered the record books as the only outfielder ever to make an unassisted triple play in professional baseball (July 19, 1911). According to The Sporting News, he had at one point been a circus acrobat, which may have helped account for the bit of extra athleticism he showed in making the tumbling play.Walter Carlisle.

Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Puppet Master 4 and 5, and Pumpkinhead II. Early life Jeff Burr was born in Aurora, Ohio, in 1963. He grew up in rural Dalton, Georgia, where he avidly read horror fanzines like Castle of Frankenstein, The Monster Times, and Famous Monsters, and eventually began making his own Super-8 films. Burr attended the University of Southern California (USC) (with R. A. Mihailoff who played Leatherface in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III). He and fellow director Kevin Meyer dropped out of USC after his third year to finish their American civil war drama Divided We Fall, which premiered in 1982 and won some acclaim at festivals around the world. Though Divided We Fall was a drama, Burr would spend most of his subsequent film career working in the Horror genre. Career For his second feature film, alternately titled From a Whisper to a Scream or The Offspring, Burr approach veteran Horror actor Vincent Price. Burr recalled in 2012, > So, the producer and I got his address from a celebrity address service, and > we went up to his door with the script and a bottle of wine in hand (Price > was a noted wine connoisseur). We came bearing gifts, and wouldn't you know… > he opened the door himself when we knocked! It was a flurry of \\"Gee, Mr. > Price, we're fans of your work…\\" and \\"we wrote this script,\\" and he actually > invited us inside. He had every reason to ignore us, and even if it was on a > polite level, he could have said, \\"Okay boys, contact my agent,\\" but he was > just so gracious. He invited us in, sat and talked with us for about 15 > minutes, took the script, and that's how it all started. After From a Whisper to a Scream premiered in 1987, Burr directed his first studio film, a sequel to the 1987 horror/thriller The Stepfather, entitled Stepfather II. The film was poorly received, and Burr balked at studio executives Bob and Harvey Weinstien's post-production re-shoots with another director. Still, Burr was subsequently contacted by New Line Cinema with an offer to direct the second sequel to Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre after the studio's first choices—including directors Jonathan Betuel and Peter Jackson—dropped out. Burr was hired only two weeks before shooting began, and consequently had little time to prepare and little creative control over the final product. The resulting film, 1990's Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III encountered problems with the MPAA, requiring 11 different submissions before receiving an R Rating, which New Line required in order to effectively distribute the film. After test audiences responded positively to Ken Foree's character, the studio brought editor Michael Knue in to shoot a new ending which focused on the character. Burr, frustrated by the changes, asked that his name be removed from the final film, but was denied on the basis that film prints had already been struck which listed him as director. Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III was not well received by critics, but nevertheless went on gross $5,765,562 on a $2,000,000 budget, making the studio a profit. Burr would go on to direct sequels to Pumpkinhead and Puppet Master, among many others. Though most of his subsequent work has been in the horror genre (Night of the Scarecrow, Devil's Den), Burr has also worked in dramedy (Eddie Presley), Science-Fiction (Spoiler, The Boy with the X-Ray Eyes) and war films (Straight into Darkness). Throughout his career, Burr has expressed frustration over studio interference, budget limitations, and other unfortunate circumstances, leading him to claim in an interview in 2012 that there were only three films which he considered to be his own: From a Whisper to a Scream, 1992's Eddie Presley, and 2004's Straight into Darkness. The others, he claimed, had, \\"decisions that were made, in my estimation, that weren't the best. So, those are the three I stand behind without a mountain of qualifications.\\" Filmography *Divided We Fall (1982) *From a Whisper to a Scream (1987) *Stepfather II (1989) *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) *Eddie Presley (1992) *Puppet Master 4 (1993) *Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994) *Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings (1994) *Night of the Scarecrow (1995) *American Hero (1997) *Johnny Mysto: Boy Wizard (1997) *The Werewolf Reborn!

His son, Jock Wallace Jr., managed Rangers, Leicester City and Sevilla. He began his career at Raith Rovers, before moving south of the border in March 1934 to join compatriot Sandy MacFarlane's Blackpool. He remained at the seaside for fourteen years, notching-up 243 league appearances for the Tangerines. Wallace made his debut at Lincoln City on 17 February 1934 and became almost an ever-present. On more than one occasion, the Scot fell out with the Blackpool board or management, and on one occasion he refused to join the team to play Leeds United in the FA Cup. He was replaced by his understudy, Joe Robinson. Wallace's argument was over contractual terms, and he eventually joined Derby County for a nominal £500 fee in February 1948.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887-1992, Breedon Books. The Rams had a goalkeeping crisis, and Wallace, who wasn't cup-tied, played in the FA Cup sixth round and semi-finals. Derby were knocked out, and it was Blackpool who went on to Wembley from the other semi-final. His job done, Wallace left Derby for Leith Athletic in August 1948, returning to Edinburgh where he had guested for Leith's rivals St Bernard's during the Second World War.

The shape is almost cylindrical, posterior end is abruptly widened. The mantle covers 50% of body length (unusually large). There are wrinkles on skin present (may disappear in preserved slugs). Mucus is thin, colourless. This slug is 15–25 mm long when preserved. The populations of this species that occur in Central Europe are much darker than other Deroceras species in that area. musculus retractor penis bc - bursa copulatrix. Reproductive system: Penis is often reduced, elongated if present, without proper penial gland but with two or more tiny glandular papillae and its end. Retractor is unforked and attached at half penis length, stimulator small, cone-shaped but looks more like a papilla. Tubular oviductus and atrium are unusually long. There is no rectal caecum. Epithelium of Deroceras laeve  Ecology  = Habitat = Deroceras laeve has high ecological tolerance, but needs permanently wet habitats. It is usually found in lowlands and very humid habitats, swamps, riversides, wetlands, especially alder and oak woods, marshlands and degraded areas, also greenhouses, often near water under wood or detritus. It tolerates subpolar and tropical temperatures. Newly created habitats are often colonized after a few years. In Switzerland in up to 1800 m altitude, but usually below 1000 m, in Bulgaria in up to 2500 m. Deroceras laeve can be a serious pest in greenhouses. On the other hand, the species is threatened by continuous elimination of wet habitats by drainage, construction projects and road construction. It is the only land gastropod that goes deliberately into the water and can survive for days submerged. Because of this unusual behavior, the species can be dispersed by flowing water. = Feeding habits = These slugs are agile and crawl quickly. They are omnivorous, but live and dead plant remains are preferred. = Life cycle = The eggs of this species can also survive when submerged; juveniles can hatch underwater and then climb to the surface. The life cycle is extremely short, and can take place within less than a month. This species can have up to 5 generations in a year, with several generations alive at the same time. Frequently there are forms with a reduced penis, which reproduce by self-fertilisation. The maximum age of this slug is not more than 1 year. = Parasites = Parasites of Deroceras laeve include: * Parelaphostrongylus tenuisMichigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment. \\"Brainworm\\". accessed 14 December 2010.

The name by which the book is also known include the ('The Self-Taught Philosopher'); and English: The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan.  Concepts  Hayy ibn Yaqdhan is an allegorical novel in which Ibn Tufail expresses philosophical and mystical teachings in a symbolic language in order to provide better understanding of such concepts. This novel is thus the most important work of Ibn Tufail's, containing the main ideas that form his system. With this novel, Tufail focuses on finding solutions of the three main problems discussed during his period: # Human, by his or her own, is able to reach the level of al-Insān al-Kāmil by merely observing and thinking of the nature, without any education. #The information that is obtained through observation, experiment, and reasoning, does not contradict with revelation. In other words, religion and philosophy (or science) are compatible, rather than contradictory. # Reaching the absolute information is individual and simply any human being is able to achieve that.  Plot  The story revolves around Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān, a little boy who grew up on an island in the Indies under the equator, isolated from the people, in the bosom of an antelope that raised him feeding him with her milk. Ḥayy has just learned to walk; imitating the sounds of antelopes, birds, and other animals in his surrounding, he learns the languages of the animals around him; and he learns to guide himself to the actions of animals by imitating their instinct. He makes his own shoes and clothes from the skins of the animal, studies the stars, till he reaches a higher level of knowledge of the finest of astrologist. His continuous explorations and observation of creatures and environment led him to gain great knowledge in natural science, philosophy and religion. He will conclude that, at the basis of the creation of the universe, a great creator must exist. Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān lived a humble modest life as Sufi and forbade himself from eating meat. Once 30 years old, he meets the first human, landed on his isolated Island. By the age of 49, he will be ready to teach other people about the knowledge he gained throughout his life.

Retrieved: August 27, 2017. Design and development Designed expressly for the executive market, the Spartan Executive was configured for both performance and comfort. Built during the Great Depression, the 7W was the brainchild of company- founder William G. Skelly of Skelly Oil who desired a fast, comfortable aircraft to support his tastes and those of his rich oil-executive colleagues.Davisson 1971, p. 48. Through a series of acquisitions, J. Paul Getty took over ownership of the Spartan Aircraft Company in 1935, and directed its fortunes from that point to 1968.\\"Spartan History.\\" spartanexecutive.com, 2003. Retrieved: August 27, 2017. The interior of the 7W is spacious and features of slide-back seat room for front-seat passengers, arm rests, ash trays, dome lighting, deep cushions, cabin heaters, ventilators, soundproofing, large windows, and interior access to the capacity luggage compartment. The interior can be configured for four or five passengers.Taylor 1989, p. 983. The 10th airframe in the production run was modified into a military demonstrator, the Spartan 7W-F, incorporating two forward-firing .30 calibre machine guns mounted on the port side near the firewall and firing through the propeller arc through a synchronized mechanism. A further modification was to provide a gunner's station at a dorsal hatch on the roof with a windscreen and machine gun fitted. Provision was also made for bomb racks under the wings. The military experiment was short-lived and the aircraft was reverted to a stock model and sold to aviatrix Arlene Davis who entered the Executive (NC17605) in the 1939 Bendix Air Races.Johnson, Frank. \\"Spartan Executive.\\" Sport Flying, Volume 8, No. 12, December 1974, p. 31.

Including the 7X prototypes, 36 7W Executives were built before production was halted in 1940. Following up on a modified Spartan Executive military demonstrator, a two-seat military variant of the 7W Executive, named the Spartan 8W Zeus, was developed. The aircraft featured a greenhouse canopy covering a tandem cockpit and was powered by a more powerful Pratt & Whitney Wasp engine. A small production run of four or five examples was made but with no official interest, the project waned.Donald 1989, p. 853. In 1942, a total of 16 7W Executives were impressed into military service with the United States Army Air Corps. The 7Ws served as executive transports for military staff as the UC-71. A post-World War II effort to rekindle interest in the Executive series, under the re-branded Spartan 12-W designation, failed to gain interest.

Both rare and common stamps have been forged and certain stamps, for instance those of the Army of the North, are more common forged than genuine.Tyler, Varro E. Focus on Forgeries: A Guide to Forgeries of Common Stamps. 2nd ed. Sidney, Ohio: Linn's Stamp News & Amos Press, 2000, pp. 246–250.  Types  Forgeries of Russian stamps can be divided into the following categories: *Forgeries of a basic stamp. These are not so common. Examples include François Fournier's forgeries of the 3.50R and 7R high value stamps \\"without thunderbolts\\" and the Rostov famine issue of the early 1920s. Some issues of the Civil War have also been forged, such as the definitives issued by Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. *Forgeries of an overprint or surcharge on a common basic stamp. The Civil War period is particularly full of these. Overprinted stamps issued by the various \\"White\\" Armies have also been forged extensively. The stamps issued by the North-West Armies were particularly popular with the forgers, and dozens of different forgeries have been identified. *Forgeries of a perforation. There have been many attempts to \\"create\\" a stamp with a rare perforation by taking an imperforate version of the stamp and forging the perforation. Examples include the Zeppelin issues of the early 1930s, many of which exist with a forged perf 11. Forging the perforation also allows for perforation varieties to be created to order. *Forgeries of a postmark on a loose stamp. A notorious batch of these are the \\"Shtempelgate\\" forgeries of rare postmarks from the Russian Offices Abroad, usually on common 1 Ruble stamps. *Stamps of the Russian Zemstvo local posts have also been forged.

He is a drummer, percussionist, pianist, songwriter and singer. He has been performing since the age of four and has appeared on over 60 releases since 1990. He is currently the drummer in the Australian rock band Rose Tattoo. Early life Born in Sydney on 4 February 1986, he was the third child and only son of Barnes and his wife Jane. His half-brother is Jimmy Barnes' oldest child, singer and actor David Campbell. Jackie Barnes was born while his father was touring the US with ZZ Top and named after Soul singer Jackie Wilson. Within days of his birth, his mother took him and his sisters to America to join their father on tour. He is of Thai and Scottish origin. When he was four, he joined older sisters Eliza-Jane 'E.J.' and Mahalia for the recording sessions of their father's Two Fires album. Their voices are among the children's choir that features on the track \\"When Your Love is Gone\\". From the age of five he formed part of the children's singing group The Tin Lids (after Glaswegian rhyming slang for \\"kids\\") with sisters Eliza-Jane 'E.J.', Elly-May and Mahalia. The Tin Lids recorded three albums between 1991 and 1994, all of which achieved platinum sales. One of their albums, Snakes & Ladders (1992) was also nominated for the ARIA Award for Best Children's Album in 1993. After finishing high school, Barnes began touring with Jimmy Barnes as Keyboardist. In 2005, Barnes successfully auditioned for the position of drummer and backing vocalist in that same band. He recorded the song \\"Same Woman\\" as a duet with father on the 2005 album Double Happiness that topped the ARIA charts. Since then he has been able to work with artists including his uncles John Swan and Diesel, Keith Urban, Jonathan Cain, Neal Schon, Steve Morse, Joe Bonamassa, Andrew Roachford, Steve Van Zandt, The Dead Daisies, Shannon Noll, The Wiggles and Glenn Hughes to name a few. In 2010 he graduated with a Bachelor of Music majoring in drum performance at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, US.

Norman invasion White Tower shown here is from the late 11th century. St John's Chapel inside the White Tower. One of only two surviving Norman churches in London. The Norman invasion of Britain in 1066 is usually considered to be the beginning of a new era in English history. William, Duke of Normandy, defeated English king Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings. Having conquered Hampshire and Kent, William and his army turned to London. Having failed to cross London bridge at Southwark, William's army marched clockwise around London and waited to the north-west at Berkhamsted. Where, having realised that resistance was pointless, a delegation from London arrived to surrender the city, and recognise William as King.Billings, Malcolm (1994), London: a companion to its history and archaeology, William soon granted a charter for London in 1067 which upheld previous Saxon rights, privileges and laws. Under William (now known as William the Conqueror) several royal forts were constructed along the riverfront of London (the Tower of London, Baynard's Castle and Montfichet's Castle) to defend against seaborne attacks by Vikings and prevent rebellions. Its growing self-government became firm with election rights granted by King John in 1199 and 1215. Buildings Gothic design. Little of the Norman edifice remains. 19th-century depiction. Church of St Bartholomew the Great, surviving Norman chancel, c. 1123 In 1097 William Rufus, the third son of William I of England (William the Conqueror) began the construction of Westminster Hall. The hall was to become the basis of the Palace of Westminster which, throughout the Medieval period, was the prime royal residence. In 1089/90 William had given the royal manor of Bermondsey for the site of Bermondsey Abbey, founded in 1082 by Alwinus Child, a citizen of London. The new abbey thus lay directly across the Thames from the White Tower, then still under construction. In 1123 the Augustinian Priory Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great was founded at West Smithfield in the City of London. Whilst only the chancel of this once large church now survives, as a parish church, the entire nave having been demolished, it is one of the most important remnants of Norman architecture in London. In 1176 construction began of the most famous incarnation of London Bridge (completed in 1209) which was built on the site of several earlier wooden bridges. This bridge would last for 600 years, and remained the only bridge across the River Thames until 1739. War and revolt London was a centre of England's Jewish population. Violence against Jews took place in 1190, after it was rumoured that the new King had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation. May 1216 saw the last time that London was truly occupied by a continental armed force, during the First Barons' War. This was when the young Louis VIII of France marched through the streets to St Paul's Cathedral. Throughout the city and in the cathedral he was celebrated as the new ruler. It was expected that this would free the English from the tyranny of King John. This was only temporarily true. The barons supporting the 29-year-old French prince decided to throw their support back to an English king when John died. Over the next several hundred years, London would shake off the heavy French cultural and linguistic influence which had been there since the times of the Norman conquest. The city, like Dover, would figure heavily into the development of Early Modern English. In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels occupied London and killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.; see p88-99 London's Jewish community was forced to leave England by the expulsion by Edward I in 1290. They left for France, Holland and further afield; their property was seized, and many suffered robbery and murder as they departed. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 led by Wat Tyler, London was invaded. A group of peasants stormed the Tower of London and executed the Lord Chancellor, Archbishop Simon Sudbury, and the Lord Treasurer. The peasants looted the city and set fire to numerous buildings. Tyler was stabbed to death by the Lord Mayor William Walworth in a confrontation at Smithfield, thus ending the revolt. During the Wars of the Roses there was strong support in London for the Yorkist cause. The Lancastrian Henry VI was forced to leave London for the Midlands in 1456 due to hostile attitudes in the capital. He was later captured and kept for five years in the Tower of London. London was eventually captured by the Yorkist Edward IV in 1471, and Henry executed. This established the Yorkist claim on the throne and ended the first phase of the Wars of the Roses. London in 1300. Capital of England In the early Middle Ages, England had no fixed capital per se; Kings moved from place to place taking their court with them. The closest thing to a capital was Winchester where the royal treasury and financial records were stored.Inwood, Stephen. A History of London (1998) This changed from about 1200 when these were moved to Westminster. From this point on, Royal government became increasingly centered upon Westminster, which steadily became the de facto capital. In the Middle Ages, Westminster was a small town up river from the City of London. From the 13th century onwards London grew up in two different parts. Westminster became the Royal capital and centre of government, whereas the City of London became the centre of commerce and trade, a distinction which is still evident to this day. The area between them became entirely urbanised by 1600. Trade and commerce Trade and commerce grew steadily during the Middle Ages, and London grew rapidly as a result. In 1100 London's population was little more than 15,000. By 1300 it had grown to roughly 80,000. Trade in London was organised into various guilds, which effectively controlled the city, and elected the Lord Mayor of London. Fire and plague Medieval London was made up of narrow and twisting streets, and most of the buildings were made from combustible materials such as wood and straw, which made fire a constant threat. Sanitation in London was poor. London lost at least half of its population during the Black Death in the mid-14th century. Between 1348 and the Great Plague of 1666 there were sixteen outbreaks of plague in the city. In 1666, the Great Fire gutted much of London within the city wall.

Seeley Wintersmith Mudd (1861–1926) was a mining engineer. Biography =Early life= He was born in Kirkwood, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri on August 16, 1861. He attended Washington University of St. Louis, where he graduated in 1883 with a degree in mining engineering.Thomas Arthur Rickard, Interviews with Mining Engineers. Mining and Scientific Press, San Francisco, 1922. =Career= In December 1885, he moved to Leadville, Colorado, to work at the Small Hopes silver mine, then in bonanza. He worked his way up from assayer to become the mine’s manager in 1888. While managing the Small Hopes mine he also leased other Leadville properties which provided him a modicum of financial independence. In 1901, he and his family (wife Della Mullock and sons Harvey S. Mudd and Seeley G. Mudd) moved to Los Angeles, California, where he worked as a consulting engineer for the Guggenheim Exploration Company. He acquired his first major capital by choosing to receive a percent of the findings instead of a fixed salary.Rickard 1922, p. 397 In 1907 he started up the Ray copper mine in Arizona, one of the first large scale porphyry copper operations. By the time of his death Ray Consolidated Copper Company had produced 200 million dollars worth of copper. It is still in production. Also in Arizona, he and Ray Con partner Philip Wiseman took a wildcat speculation on the United Eastern mine in the Oatman district. When they hit high grade ore in 1916 they caused one of the last of the desert country gold rushes. The high grade ore deposit proved Arizona's richest and provided the partners with a quick but short-lived profit. In early 1914, just before World War I, he partnered with Charles Godfrey Gunther and Philip Wiseman for a drilling opportunity in the island of Cyprus, where evidence of Roman and Phoenician mining of Copper ore had been found. After obtaining permission from the British government, which was ruling Cyprus at the time, Cyprus Mines Corporation was formally launched and in March 1916 and shares of stock authorized. As detailed in his \\"The Story of Cyprus Mines Corporation,\\" David Lavender credits Seeley with the creation of the company but his son Harvey Seeley Mudd with bringing in the overwhelming success and profits of this multi-national corporation. During World War I, Seeley Mudd applied for a commission in the Engineer Officers Reserve Corps, and on February 12, 1917, he received his commission as a Major. In 1918 he became a Colonel in the U.S. Army. He served as one of the government's dollar a year men, helping upgrade munitions production for the War Department.Rickard 1922, p. 412 Seeley W Mudd died in St. Louis May 24, 1926. He was an advocate for education and, among other gifts in his will, provided one million dollars for the Claremont College in Pomona, California, where he had been chairman of its board.

Life John Henry Thomas was born in Hastings, a suburb of Freetown of Creole recaptive parents, and his father died when he was three years old. John Henry Malamah Thomas is an outstanding example of a self-made magnate. He promoted trade between Colony and \\"up-country\\", served as Mayor of Freetown eight times, and became an unofficial member of the Legislative Council in 1907. Born at Hastings of Aku recaptive parents, his father died when he was three years old. Malamah Thomas started school in 1845, but the family's straitened circumstances made it necessary for him to spend the better part of his time helping his mother in her bid to make ends meet. At the age of fourteen, John left school and entered upon a business career. Starting as a clerk/trainee with a number of business concerns, he later set out on his own. He started his business with a loan of £100 secured from a friend, Dr. Robert Smith. He built a factory on the Rokel River at a place called Malamah — that was how he came by the nickname \\"Malamah\\". Some years later, he closed his business on the Rokel and moved to the Scarcies where he worked as an agent of the Compagnie du Senegal (later Compagnie Francaise de L'Afrique Occidental, popularly known as CFAO). But before taking up his post on the Scarcies in 1882 he opened a small shop in Freetown under the management of his wife. Six years later, Malamah Thomas resigned the CFAO agency and returned to Freetown to operate his business. Bringing his twenty-three years of commercial experience to bear upon the running of the business, it quickly expanded and prospered, and Thomas became one of the leading merchants in the city. He traded chiefly in cloth fabrics, and patented in England his own brand of cotton known as \\"Malamah baft\\". The beautiful \\"Malamah House\\" he built at East Street stands today as an eloquent monument of his commercial prowess and success. Thomas also served both church and state. He was for thirteen years warden of Holy Trinity Church of which he later became Treasurer. In 1891, he was appointed Charity Commissioner, and became Commissioner of the Peace in 1894. In the Freetown municipal elections of 1903, he entered the City Council for the East Ward. In 1904, he was elected Mayor of Freetown, and held that position eight years. When in 1907, he was appointed an unofficial member of the Legislative Council, members of the Hastings Re-Union Committee presented him with a Silver Cup in recognition of his \\"present position as a native merchant of sterling repute, a Justice of the Peace, thrice a City Magistrate, and now a member of the Legislative Council\\". His political activities went beyond Sierra Leone. He became President of the local branch of the National Congress of British West Africa, a body formed in 1920, advocating united political agitation for self- government among the African peoples of British West Africa. He supported the Congress with both his money and time. John Henry Malamah Thomas died in Freetown on January 18, 1922.

Built in 1952, the Chambers are a unique facility, capable of simulating an extreme range of global weather conditions for the testing of both the physical properties of military equipment and the physiology and adaptations of human subjects. A variety of tenants utilize the DCCs, which are operated by the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM). The Doriot Climatic Chambers, Natick, Massachusetts. History The DCCs were constructed from 1952 to 1954 at the time of the founding of what is now the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and Center. At a rededication ceremony on 24 August 1994, the facility was named for Brigadier General Georges F. Doriot (1899–1987), a French-American who, during World War II, worked with a large staff in the Quartermaster Corps to develop, test and quickly field improved clothing and equipment for the U.S. soldier. A major renovation was completed in 1996. Research =Users= A number of tenants of the SSC utilize the DCCs including USARIEM, the NCTRF, and the USMC. =Equipment testing= Examples of military equipment evaluated at the DCC include tents, parachutes, heaters, airbeams, medical devices and wild mills. The heat transfer properties of a wide range of new protective military clothing are tested at the DCC. Constant control of temperature (to within +/- 1 °F) is possible with simultaneous control of both wind and humidity. (Other chambers in the world have only two-environmental-parameter capability, making the DCCs unique.) External observer and test monitoring areas have electronic data acquisition systems to record a variety of testing parameters and provide customized plotting, graphing and printouts. =Human research= Human volunteers endure treadmill sessions at the Doriot Climatic Chambers.. The DCCs are man-rated for human safety. Human research in the DCC is aimed at the prevention of injuries and the minimizing of performance decrements in order to enhance overall operational effectiveness. The Chambers simulate types of environmental conditions that soldiers may encounter in the course of their real world duties. Soldier (and civilian) volunteers walk or run on treadmills to simulate a variety of work rates at different environmental extremes. Each chamber has two 5-person treadmills that can operate up to at a 12% grade. A facility kitchen prepares meals to test the effects of nutrition on physical performance. The DCCs include a dormitory facility for sleep studies as well as dressing rooms, showers and laundering facilities which support prolonged live-in studies. Specifications and capabilities The dimensions of each of the two wind tunnels (Tropic Wind Tunnel and Arctic Wind Tunnel) are 60 by 10 by . Equipment scheduled for testing enters the tunnels via high by wide doors.

She was designed by Fredrik Henrik af Chapman, built at Djurgårdsvarvet in Stockholm in the summer of 1778, and launched the same year. Amphion, named after Zeus' son and culture patron in Greek mythology, served as a royal yacht and headquarters ship. The ship was essentially a modified turuma, a type of shallow-draught frigate that served in the Swedish archipelago fleet. She was equipped with oars to allow her maneuverability of a galley while retaining a broadside of heavy guns and a full rig. She was equivalent to similar \\"archipelago frigates\\" of the archipelago fleet, but at Gustav III's request, she was built without heavy cannons and therefore differed significantly from the other ships of the same type. Amphion turned out to be one of Chapman's few failures as a ship designer. She suffered from poor seakeeping ability and was also too heavy to row. On her maiden voyage from Karlskrona to Stockholm, poor weather conditions left Amphion shipwrecked in the archipelago of Stockholm, and Gustav III was required to come ashore at Dalaro. Thereafter, she was used mostly for trips out on Lake Mälaren, though also she was used as the king's personal command ship during The Russo-Swedish war of 1788–1790. She later served as a barracks ship into the 19th Century. In 1884, Amphion broken up for firewood. Amphions figurehead and stern castle with the royal command room were spared, and can be seen at the Maritime Museum in Stockholm. The preserved parts underwent preservation and restoration, performed by conservation studio Ateljé Catellani, between 2003 and 2006. The current stern was added in 1791 after the ship was damaged at the end of the Russian War. The former stern lacked the royal cypher, and its four windows gates were of a simpler design.

Vestergaard was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast.Historie - Dansk Cricket-Forbund - Officiel hjemmeside for DCF \\"Den 18. maj 1889 blev Dansk Boldspil Union stiftet, hvor cricketspillet straks kom ind under. ... Men også spillere som Søren Henriksen Lancashire, Søren Vestergaard, Warwickshire, Amjad Khan Kent og Sussex, og Thomas Hansen ...\\" Early career Prior to playing for Denmark at any level, Vestergaard had been scouted by Welsh county Glamorgan in 1990, making a single Second XI appearance for the county in a one-day match against the Warwickshire Second XI. In July 1991, Vestergaard appeared in two matches for Denmark Under-19s against Bermuda Under-19s and Ireland Under-19s during an International Youth Tournament in Winnipeg, Canada. In that same year he first appeared for Denmark in a friendly against English minor county Durham. Further matches for Denmark followed in friendly appearances against Wales and the Netherlands in 1992, as well as the Netherlands and Scotland in 1993. He played in his first ICC Trophy in Kenya in the 1994 ICC Trophy, making his first appearance in that competition against Hong Kong. He made seven further appearances in the 1994 competition, scoring a total of 123 runs at an average of 30.75, with a high score of 25, while with the ball he took 4 wickets at a bowling average of 50.75. Having shown promise in his appearances for Denmark, Vestergaard played Second XI cricket in English county cricket for Warwickshire in the 1994 season. He played Second XI cricket for Warwickshire until the 1998 season, but was unable to force his way into the Warwickshire first eleven. He appeared in his second ICC Trophy in the 1997 version, making six appearances in the competition. Vestergaard took 12 wickets in his six matches, which came at an average of 6.75, with best figures of 3/15. He was less successful with the bat, scoring 66 runs at an average of 13.20, with a high score of 24. During that period when he played Second XI cricket in England, he also played for Denmark in the 1996 and 1998 European Cricket Championship. Later career Vestergaard's next ICC Trophy appearance came in Canada in the 2001 ICC Trophy, where he played in eight matches. The tournament was highly successful for him, with Vestergaard ending it as the tournaments joint leading wicket-taker alongside the Netherlands Roland Lefebvre, with 20 wickets at an average of 11.55. In his third match of the tournament against the United States, he claimed a hat-trick. He scored 151 runs in his eight matches, which came at an average of 18.87, with a high score of 47. This was his last appearance in the ICC Trophy, with him not appearing the 2005 ICC Trophy in Ireland. He later made his debut in List A cricket for Denmark against Wales Minor Counties in the 1st round of the 2004 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, which was played in August 2003 to avoid fixture congestion the following season. At the time, Denmark were permitted to take part in the domestic one-day tournament in English county cricket. Vestergaard captained the team in this match, having inherited the captaincy from Aftab Ahmed, scoring 4 runs in Denmark's innings of 189/8, before he was dismissed by Tony Smith. Wales Minor Counties won the match by seven wickets, with Vestergaard bowling seven wicketless overs during their chase. He played intermittently for Denmark over the next few years, appearing for them in the 2004 and 2008 European Cricket Championship Division One. Vestergaard was later selected in Denmark's squad for the World Cup Qualifier in South Africa, by which time the captaincy has passed to Frederik Klokker. He made seven List A appearances in the tournament, including his final appearance to date in that format, against Uganda. He took a single wicket during the tournament (that of Ugandan Benjamin Musoke), while with the bat he scored 62 runs at an average of 12.40, with a high score of 39, which came against Afghanistan. This tournament marks the last time he has played for Denmark. Outside of cricket, he works as a teacher.

Plot ; Ryo is a high school freshman who tends to take people's words literally. After being hurt several times because she misunderstood someone, she avoids people. She creates an imaginary cell phone, feeling it would be pointless to buy one when no one would call. One day while she is on the bus, however, her imaginary cell phone begins to ring. At the other end is a boy named Shinya who is also calling with an imaginary cell phone. Ryo is shocked and after they disconnect, she tries calling people and connects with a college student named Yumi, who instructs her in the ways of imaginary phones. Though Shinya lives an hour in the past from Ryo, they talk regularly through their imaginary phones, staying constantly connected. Through their friendship, Ryo is able to find her voice and begin talking in the real world. They eventually talk on the real phone, and decide to meet. Ryo takes a bus to the airport, but a car nearly runs her over. Shinya pushes her out of the way and is struck instead. In the ambulance, Shinya dies. Ryo calls Shinya in the past. She tries to save him by saying she hated him on sight, but he sees through her and gets her to admit what happened. He is determined to save her, so they frantically say their good-byes. Ryo goes to his funeral and afterwards finds his locker where he left a cassette radio he'd promised her. Ryo also realizes that Yumi is really her future self. ; An unnamed Boy is put in the special class at school after he attacks a classmate who teased him about the burn mark on his back. The Boy's father regularly abused him, including leaving the burn on his back by throwing an iron at him. His mother abandoned him, and he now lives with an aunt and uncle he feels don't care anything about him. In the class, he meets Asato, a quiet boy who rarely talks. Asato's mother murdered his father and then tried to kill Asato as well. While alone with Asato after school, the Boy hurts himself carving. Asato comes over and touches him, and half the wound leaves the boy's arm and moves to Asato's so that they are equally sharing the pain. They become friends that day, and begin exploring the depths of Asato's powers. After Asato removes a scrape from a little boy's knee, the child's mother treats them to ice cream. At the parlor, they meet Shiho, a young woman with a burned face who hides her scars behind a mask. When a kid the Boy had pushed out of a window breaks his arm with a baseball bat, Asato takes that wound as well, but then moves it to the kid with the bat. The Boy decides Asato should move all of his wounds to his father, who is lying unconscious and dying in the hospital. Whenever gets new injuries, the Boy would take Asato there to use his father's dying body as a \\"dumping ground.\\" Eventually, they share the secret of Asato's powers with Shiho and she asks Asato to remove the burn for just three days so she can remember what its like to live without it. She leaves town afterward, however, and Asato sinks into a depression. No one can stand looking at him with the scar on his face, even the Boy, so they go to the hospital to give it to the Boy's father. However, when the arrive, they find he had just died. The Boy cries for him, and asks Asato to move all the scars back from his father's body to him instead. Asato says he can't and runs, and the Boy realizes Asato had never given any of the wounds to his father after all. Asato runs from through the hospital, curing everyone he touches and taking on their wounds. The Boy realizes Asato wants to die because he thinks no one wants him. Outside, he takes on the fatal wounds of an accident victim, but the Boy convinces him to give him half, just like the day they became friends, so that they could share the pain equally. The wounds are serious and both spend a long time in the hospital, but during the stay the Boy comes to the conclusion that Asato was given the power because he had a pure heart, and that he wants Asato to always know someone is there willing to share his pain. ; A patient at a hospital finds a flower with the face of a girl, that hums a beautiful melody.

History The store traced its roots to 1877, when Detroit merchants C. R. Mabley and Joseph T. Carew, en route to Memphis, were stranded in Cincinnati by a late train and wound up going into business in the heart of what was then a booming river city. Having missed their connection, they walked around town and reached Fountain Square, saw a \\"For Rent\\" sign, and decided that was a fine place for a store. Mabley & Carew was the first store in Cincinnati to adopt full-page newspaper ads, to give elaborate Christmas performances, and to set up the Arbor Day custom. The Mabley & Carew building was once illuminated by 10,000 lights that glimmered opposite Fountain Square. The company was owned by a joint partnership of Messrs Mabley and Carew but managed by Carew. After Mabley's death in 1885, Carew became sole owner of the business. Carew died in 1914 and was succeeded as company president by his first cousin Bolton Stretch Armstrong, who ran the company for the next 37 years. Mabley and Carew marketing material (ca 1898) In 1929 the Carew Building, a nearby office block also built by Carew, was demolished and replaced by Cincinnati's landmark Carew Tower, completed in 1930 after 17 months' work. This complex was the home to the flagship Mabley & Carew department store from 1930 to 1960, until the business was purchased by Allied Stores and consolidated with its Rollman and Sons Department Store (aka Rollman's) division, an existing founding division of Allied. The Rollman's branch store at Swifton Center immediately became a Mabley and Carew branch, however the Rollman's flagship store was closed and extensively renovated. By 1962 Mabley & Carew had moved its store across the street into the Rollman's building, renamed the Mabley and Carew Building. By 1964, Mabley & Carew was also consolidated with the former E. C. Denton Stores Co. stores acquired by Allied in 1952. Both the Robinson-Schwenn Department Store in nearby Hamilton, Ohio and the John Ross Store in Middletown, Ohio were converted to Mabley & Carew branch stores. The Wren's Department Store in Springfield, Ohio, another former Denton store, retained its name but some administrative functions were performed by other Allied divisions. In 1978, Dayton, Ohio-based Elder-Beerman purchased what were then six Mabley & Carew stores in Cincinnati, Hamilton and Middletown and eventually converted them to the Elder-Beerman nameplate. Wren's Department Store in Springfield was not included in the sale and became part of Allied's William H. Block Co. Department Store division based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The old Rollman's building was eventually closed and torn down in the late 1980s to make way for a proposed, but not ever built, new tallest building in Cincinnati, Fountain Square West. This site is now occupied by a vacant Cincinnati-based Macy's store slated for mixed-use redevelopment as of 2019.

Rescued from a slave ship headed for Brazil, he was apprenticed to a French shopkeeper and taught himself to read and write. Ezzidio eventually rose to the position of mayor of Freetown and later became a member the colonial governor's Legislative Council. Kidnapping Ezzidio, a Nupe from what is now Niger State, was kidnapped by slavers when he was young and brought to an area populated by the Yoruba. In 1827, he was sold to white slave traders, who put him on board a ship bound for Brazil. The ship was intercepted by the Royal Navy, and Ezzidio and the other 541 slaves who were still alive were landed in Freetown, Sierra Leone in October 1827. Business and political career Ezzidio became the apprentice of a French shopkeeper named Beyaust; Beyaust named his apprentice \\"Isadore\\". The name was written down as \\"Ezzido\\", and eventually morphed into \\"Ezzidio\\". After the death of the Frenchman, Ezzidio was hired by an English firm. He managed a European-owned shop and then used the money he saved to start his own trading firm. He taught himself to read and write.Sanneh, pp. 129-130 In 1841, Ezzidio purchased property for £100. He visited England the next year, making import deals with companies based there; by importing directly, he eliminated the need for middle men. Goods that were sent to his George Street property, at a total value of between £3000 and £4000 per year, included clothing such as suits and boots, foodstuffs such as ham, cookies, tea, and fortified wines (port and sherry).Sanneh, p. 130 In 1844, William Fergusson, Governor of Sierra Leone, appointed him to the position of alderman, and in 1845 Ezzidio became Mayor of Freetown. In 1862, Governor Samuel Wensley Blackall split the Governor's Council into two parts, an Executive and a Legislative Council; the latter allowed representation from, among others, the colony's merchants. The Mercantile Association, in a vote consisting of twenty-four Africans, fourteen Europeans, and one Caribbean merchant, elected Ezzidio to represent them on this body. While on the council, he was noted for his fairness and unobtrusiveness.Sanneh, pp. 130-131 Ezzidio described himself as an \\"oracle\\" of the people; some people, meanwhile, nicknamed him \\"dancing bear\\" due to his size and energy.Sanneh, p. 131 Wesleyan Church involvement Ezzidio joined the Wesleyan Church in 1835. He became a lay preacher in 1842 and also ran a Sunday school. He is recorded to have made the largest donation of all contributors at an 1864 church celebration.Sanneh, p. 132 In 1864, at Ezzidio's request, a white superintendent was sent from England to supervise the Wesleyan mission. This superintendent, Benjamin Trebaskis, was a Nonconformist, strongly sectarian, and opposed to the interdenominational cooperation Ezzidio and others in the church had previously supported.Salleh, pp. 133-134 Trebaskis feuded with Ezzidio over church policy until the latter's death in October 1872.

The American Board of Internal Medicine is not a membership society, educational institution, or licensing body. History The American Board of Internal Medicine, the largest of 24 member certifying boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties, was established in 1936 by the American Medical Association and the American College of Physicians to issue certification to physicians. Since that time, the American Board of Internal Medicine has categorized physicians into one or more of its 20 subspecialties based on training and the passing of a standardized exam, namely: *Adolescent Medicine *Adult Congenital Heart Disease *Advanced Heart Failure & Transplant Cardiology *Cardiovascular Disease *Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology *Intensive care medicine *Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism *Gastroenterology *Geriatric Medicine *Hematology *Hospice & Palliative Care *Hospital Medicine *Infectious Disease *Interventional Cardiology *Medical Oncology *Nephrology *Pulmonary Disease *Rheumatology *Sleep Medicine *Transplant Hepatology The current president and chief executive officer of the American Board of Internal Medicine is Richard J. Baron. The American Board of Internal Medicine adopted a governance structure that consists of three entities, namely a Board of Directors, ABIM Council, and Specialty Boards. Certification American Board of Internal Medicine Board Certification demonstrates that physicians have completed a residency in a specified medical specialty and have passed a rigorous knowledge assessment exam. Additionally, certification encompasses the six general competencies established by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Following regulations established by the American Board of Medical Specialties, in order to be certified, a physician must: *Complete the requisite predoctoral medical education *Meet the training requirements *Meet the licensure requirements and procedural requirements *Pass a secure board certification examination Physicians may become board certified when they have successfully completed residency or fellowship training and by passing a secure examination. Unlike licensure, board certification is not a requirement to practice medicine. Many hospitals require internists to be board certified in order to have admitting privileges, and many health plans require certification for contracting or eligibility for select networks. The American Board of Internal Medicine asserts that there is a growing body of research that suggests: * A physician's ability to independently and accurately self-assess is in dispute, with research showing no consensus and more clinical experience does not necessarily lead to better outcomes of care. * Fewer than 30% of physicians examine their own performance data and try to improve. The MOC program structure tries to address these concerns with a sound theoretical rationale via the six ACGME competencies framework and a respectable body of scientific evidence, and to address its relationship to patient outcomes, physician performance, validity of the assessment or educational methods utilized and learning or improvement potential. The validity of the studies that the American Board of Internal Medicine cites to support these arguments has been questioned, because the authors of these studies are individuals who are employed by, or have previously been employed by, the American Board of Medical Specialties or its related bodies (see Hawkins, Richard E.). In addition, there appears to be a tightly-knit, self-credentialed \\"patient safety/medical quality\\" industry developing in the United States, from which the authors of many of the studies supporting maintenance of certification have emerged. The American Board of Internal Medicine is an organization that attempts to assess physicians through proprietary testing and completion of required modules. The American Board of Internal Medicine has issued more than 425,000 initial certificates in internal medicine and its subspecialties in the United States and its territories since its founding.ABIM. Number of candidates certified. Feb. 11, 2014. http://www.abim.org/pdf/data-candidates- certified/Number-Certified-Annually.pdf From 2001 to 2013, American Board of Internal Medicine certified 91,024 physicians in general internal medicine. From 2001 to 2013, the American Board of Internal Medicine certified more than 10,000 cardiologists and more than 6,400 medical oncologists.ABIM. Number of candidates certified. Feb. 11, 2014. http://www.abim.org/pdf/data-candidates- certified/Number-Certified-Annually.pdf More than 140,000 physicians – including more than 8,000 physicians holding certifications that hold certifications which are valid indefinitely — are currently enrolled in the American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification program. = Maintenance of Certification (MOC)= The American Board of Internal Medicine asserts that research shows that physician knowledge deteriorates and practice habits and patterns fail to change, over time, in response to medical advances. Every 10 years, some internists and subspecialists certified in or after 1990 renew their certifications through the American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification program. The American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification program changed in January 2014. The program now requires physicians to: *Possess a valid medical license *Earn Maintenance of Certification points (points count toward all certificates you are maintaining) ::*Some Maintenance of Certification activity every two years ::*100 Maintenance of Certification points every five years *Pass Maintenance of Certification exam in one's specialty every 10 years  Criticism of Maintenance of Certification Program  The Maintenance of Certification program has been criticized for taking time away from patient care, not being proven to improve patient care, and costing more in time and expense than it can justify. On February 3, 2015, the American Board of Internal Medicine announced more changes to the Maintenance of Certification program. In a press release, the American Board of Internal Medicine apologized that it had \\"clearly got it wrong\\", and it admitted that the program changes in January 2014 were instituted prematurely. The American Board of Internal Medicine has suspended the Patient Survey and Patient Safety components for at least two years, and it will make changes to the secure exam to make it more reflective of medical practice among others. The final form of Maintenance of Certification remains to be seen. On March 10, 2015, an article written by Kurt Eichenwald for Newsweek raised skepticism of the ABIM Foundation and its merit. In July 2015, the Annals of Internal Medicine published an independent cost-analysis of the American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification program. Using simulation modeling of the entire American Board of Internal Medicine-certified workforce of US physicians, researchers from the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University estimated that the Feb 2015 version of American Board of Internal Medicine Maintenance of Certification would cost $5.7 billion over ten years, including $561 million in American Board of Internal Medicine's fees and $5.1 billion in time costs (arising from 32.7 million physician hours spent completing Maintenance of Certification requirements). Internists will incur an average of $23,607 (95% CI, $5,380 to $66,383) in Maintenance of Certification costs over 10 years, ranging from $16,725 for general internists to $40,495 for hematologists-oncologists. The authors concluded that \\"A rigorous evaluation of its effect on clinical and economic outcomes is warranted to balance potential gains in health care quality and efficiency against the high costs identified in this study.\\" For the first time, the American Board of Internal Medicine faces competition in the certification business from another entity, the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons (nbpas.org).

The two-part version was also released in Finland and Norway, but for the rest of the world a shorter, one-part export version was made. In 1927 the film was recut, almost halving its running time. This was the only version that was archived. In 1933 a sound version was released theatrically in Stockholm, with the intertitles removed, along with additional edits and some reordering of the scenes. Most of the missing material was discovered 20 years later and a restored version with new intertitles was released in theatres. The Swedish Film Institute added newly found fragments throughout the years, but as of the 1975 restoration about 450 metres of film from the original cut remained missing. In February 2018, the completion of a new, comprehensive restoration was announced. The 2018 version is 16 minutes longer than the previous restoration and brings the film close to its original running time. It also restores the film's tinting scheme for the first time since its original release. =Home video= In 2008, a Swedish DVD was released by AB Svensk Filmindustri, with English, French, Portuguese, Spanish and German subtitles. The 192-minute restoration played at 184 minutes, due to PAL's 4% speed-up. It featured a specially commissioned 2005 score by pianist and silent film music composer Matti Bye. The same version was also released on US DVD in 2006, by Kino International. It also played at 184 minutes as the NTSC DVD used the unconverted PAL transfer.

History The club has its origins in TSG Schönberg which was created as SG Schönberg in 1945 at the end of World War II and later played as BSG Traktor Schönberg. In 1962 this side merged with SG Dynamo 1950 Schönberg to form TSG Schönberg. The current-day club was founded on 1 July 1995 when the football department of TSG established itself as independent. The new team was initiated into the seventh tier Bezirksliga Mecklenburg- Vorpommern in the 1995–96 season and immediately began a steady rise to the Oberliga Nordost-Nord (IV). They advanced out of the Berzirksliga to capture divisional titles in the Landesliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (VI) in 1996 and the Verbandsliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (V) in 1998. Schönberg then played seven seasons in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord, winning a title there in 2003 and taking part in a Regionalliga (III) promotion playoff which they lost to FC Sachsen Leipzig. Throughout their short existence as an independent side the club has been dominant in play for the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Pokal (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Cup) appearing as a finalist in 1997 and then lifting the trophy each year from 1999 to 2004. This earned Schönberg entry to German Cup competition where they were put out in the first round in each appearance at the hands of Bundesliga sides including Bayern Munich (2000, 0:4), VfB Stuttgart (2001, 2:4), Hamburger SV (2002, 0:6), Borussia Mönchengladbach (2003, 0:3), and 1. FC Kaiserslautern (2004, 0:15). Schönberg faltered in the 2004–2005 season and was relegated to the Verbandsliga for a season, but earned a prompt return to the Oberliga by claiming another fifth division title. After a seventh-place finish in the Oberliga in the 2006–07 season, the club decided to return to the Verbandsliga. In 2013 the club won promotion to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord once more where it played until 2015 when a runners-up finish took it up to the Regionalliga Nordost.Das deutsche Fußball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesFC Schöneberg 95 at Fussball.de Tables and results of all German football leagues Honours The club's honours: * Bezirksliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (VII) ** Champions: 1996 * Landesliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (VI) ** Champions: 1997 * Verbandsliga Mecklenburg- Vorpommern (V) ** Champions: 1998, 2006, 2009 ** Runners-up: 2008, 2013 * Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Pokal ** Winners: 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2012 * NOFV-Oberliga Nord (IV) ** Champions: 2003 ** Runners-up: 2015 Stadium FC Schönberg plays in the Jahnstadion which has a capacity of 6,000 (590 seats).

Named after Harold A. Ogust from the United States, the convention is also known as the 'Blue Club response' from the bidding system developed by Benito Garozzo. Application After a weak-two opening bid, a forcing relay bid of 2NT by responder asks opener to describe the strength and quality of his hand. Responder usually has values worthy of an opening bid and is interested in game, although he does not guarantee trump support. Responses The standard responses to the Ogust convention are: * 3 shows a \\"minimal\\" hand with a \\"poor\\" suit * 3 shows a \\"minimal\\" hand with a \\"good\\" suit * 3 shows a \\"maximal\\" hand with a \\"poor\\" suit * 3 shows a \\"maximal\\" hand with a \\"good\\" suit * 3NT shows a \\"solid\\" suit (that is, AKQ of the long suit) The definitions of \\"minimal\\" and \\"maximal\\" hands and \\"poor\\" and \\"good\\" suits are matters of partnership agreement. Many players regard a \\"minimal\\" hand as 6-7 high card points (HCP) and a \\"maximal\\" hand as 8 or more HCP. There's more variation in the interpretation of \\"poor\\" and \\"good\\" suits. Partnerships that are strict in their preempts tend to regard only suits with two of the top three or three of the top five cards as \\"good\\" while partnerships that preempt with poorer suits may describe weaker suits as \\"good.\\" After knowing the quality of opener's hand, responder can set the contract. Variants There are many variants to the Ogust convention. Some partnerships reverse the meaning of 3 and 3, which is Ogust's original formula. * 3 shows a \\"minimal\\" hand with a \\"poor\\" suit * 3 shows a \\"maximal\\" hand with a \\"poor\\" suit * 3 shows a \\"minimal\\" hand with a \\"good\\" suit * 3 shows a \\"maximal\\" hand with a \\"good\\" suit Ogust's original formula also did not include the 3NT bid showing a solid suit. Other variants define a \\"poor\\" suit to be one of the top three honors, and a good suit to be two of the top three honors, with \\"solid\\" suit denoting AKQ, or define minimum strength to be 6-8 HCP, and maximum strength to be 9-10 HCP (Benji Acol) References Category:Bridge conventions ","title":"Ogust convention"},{"id":"9817573","text":"Below is a list of diplomatic missions during World War II that were undertaken by the allied forces. * Arcadia (1941) -- Washington Conference between President of the United States Franklin D.

The creature has drawn the attention of many philosophers and literary critics, who have all attempted to interpret its meaning; thus, there are numerous analyses of the text. In 1919, the story appeared in Ein Landarzt. Kleine Erzählungen (A Country Doctor), a collection of Kafka's short stories published by Kurt Wolff (Munich and Leipzig).Kafka, Franz. The Complete Stories. Translated by Willa and Edwin Muir. New York City: Schocken Books, 1995. 473.  Etymology  The story, which is in the first-person narrative told entirely by the family man mentioned in the title, begins by discussing the etymological disparities associated with the word Odradek: Some say the word Odradek is of Slavonic origin, and try to account for it on that basis. Others again believe it to be of German origin, only influenced by Slavonic. The uncertainty of both interpretations allows one to assume with justice that neither is accurate, especially as neither of them provides an intelligent meaning of the word. The narrator hopes that by discovering the meaning of the name, they will be able to clarify its purpose and origin, yet conclude that none of these derivations, either German nor Slavic, can produce a sensible meaning of the word. This indicates that Odradek has no identifiable meaning, and therefore no apparent origin. Plot The story deals with the narrator's attempt to make sense of the only additional character, Odradek, and gives a detailed description of the creature in the second paragraph: At first glance it looks like a flat star- shaped spool for thread, and indeed it does seem to have thread wound upon it; to be sure, they are only old, broken-off bits of thread, knotted and tangled together, of the most varied sorts and colours. But it is not only a spool, for a small wooden crossbar sticks out of the middle of the star, and another small rod is joined to that at a right angle. These details offer the reader the ability to examine and criticize the purpose and necessities of objects for things or people such as Odradek. Odradek is described as an object, yet is also given a “hypothetical humanoid appearance” when the narrator describes the object as being able to stand upright on two points of the star. In the fourth paragraph the narrator states that Odradek has a lingering presence in his home, often not seen but his presence is noticeable. It is discovered that Odradek can speak, again seen as having human capabilities. Throughout the story, the narrator provides an extensive analysis of Odradek, attempting to emphasize how the object has taken on a life of its own, displaying life like qualities and traits, as well as his silent relationship with the object. The narrator's main concern about the creature Odradek is revealed in the final paragraph: \\"In vain I ask myself, what will happen to him. Can he die? Everything that dies has once had a sort of aim, a sort of activity, which has worn it out; this is not the case of Odradek. Will he therefore one day tumble down the stairs before the feet of my children and my children's children, trailing a line of thread after him? It's clear he does nobody any harm; but the notion that he might even outlive me is almost painful to me.\\" The narrator fears that this purposeless object will outlive him. The family man, throughout the story, fears that Odradek will attack his role as the family man, the patriarchal figure in society.  Interpretations  = Useless object = Odradek appears to represent an object with no clear purpose or apparent use. It appears not unlike an exhausted spool for thread, wound about by \\"old, broken-off bits of thread, knotted and tangled together, of the most varied sorts and colors\\". However, the text makes it explicit that there is no apparent use for the object. As such, scholars such as Samuel Rammelmeier have argued that the obscurity and uselessness of the object serves to create a foil for the narrator. He argues that the object's apparent uselessness, when seen in light of the existential dread pervading the last paragraph, can be understood as underlining the narrator's lack of purpose. This is an opinion shared by Heinz Politzer when he states that Kafka's absurdist writing emphasizes the meaninglessness of its subjects' lives. Such an interpretation can be compared to the nihilist tone of Kafka's better-known work, The Metamorphosis. = Critique of capitalism = Willi Goetschel analyzes \\"The Cares of a Family Man\\" from several perspectives. From the perspective of Marxist literary criticism the story might be a critique of capitalism in its last stage. Odradek represents commodities, it is \\"what is left of life once everything is reduced to materialism\\".Goetschel, Willi. Columbia University, Kafka's Dis/Enchanted World Anya Meksin agrees that this interpretation is possible from a Marxist perspective. Odradek, being made of thread for mending, represents the world of manmade practical objects separated from the human work that produced them, and the relation between the house father and Odradek represent the alienated relation between worker and commodities he has produced. The idea that Odradek will survive the narrator and the anguish this situation causes to him can also be interpreted as the idea of commodities being inherited and transcend the worker who made them, but in such a way that the worker himself would be completely ignored. = Objectification of memory = According to Goetschel, from a Freudian approach Odradek can be seen as \\"the psychological return of the repressed\\". In Freud's theory of repression, an unacknowledged trauma surfaces as unconscious associations and neuroses, which affect thought, memory and dreams. Such an interpretation is supported by Kafka's letters and biography: in approximately 1921, he wrote a letter to Milena Jesenka in which he explains his mental disturbances in a distinctly Freudian light. Furthermore, Kafka's Letter to His Father indicates that Kafka had suffered from emotional trauma due to his childhood, which lends biographical weight to this argument. = Religious interpretation = A religious perspective opens up another interpretation of the text. Goetschel indicates that the star-shaped form of the creature might represent tradition (specifically Jewish tradition), which is passed on from generation to generation and accumulates some more bits of \\"thread\\" in each generation. According to Meksin, Odradek represents a rupture between the world of the family man and some other transcendent realm. It is immortal, and hides in shadows carrying a message from generation to generation, and witnessing it all. Meksin goes on to indicate that the physical description of Odradek with its wooden crossbar sticks joined to that at a right angle can also remind us of crucifixion. While Rammelmeier argues against clean-cut metaphorical interpretations of the story, he acknowledges that Odradek possesses some supernatural qualities, such as disappearance and reappearance. He states that these supernatural qualities are made all the more prominent by the text's otherwise objective or sachlich style. He adds that, due to the text's stylistic dryness, a reader who reads the story through an ideological lens may find evidence for any interpretation they may wish to hold. Nevertheless, the story's last passage and its concern with \\"my children's children\\", the object's apparent lack of purpose, the ephemeral qualities of Odradek, the religious symbolism of the transverse rod and the star shape, and the mention of death in the last line of the story provide textual evidence for associations of Odradek to religion, or at least cultural traditions. = Odradek as complement = Slavoj Žižek emphasizes in his analysis that Odradek \\"once had some sort of intelligible shape and is now only a broken-down remnant,\\" and as such it should be part of a whole. The relation between the narrator (a family man, a father) and the creature could be this whole: Odradek might be the complement of the narrator, who would also be broken down, with part of him transferred into Odradek. That is why Odradek is something a family man has to care for.

The tomb was planned to serve as the final resting place for prominent Communist figures along with the remains of Communists who had been buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. According to the plan, Vladimir Lenin's embalmed body would be transferred from Lenin's Mausoleum to the new Pantheon. The decision to build the Pantheon was taken by the Central Committee of the CPSU and Council of Ministers in a joint decision of March 6, 1953, the day following Joseph Stalin's death.See e.g.: Decision to build in Moscow a monumental building - the Pantheon - a monument of eternal glory of great people of the Soviet country. It was decided that the Pantheon would be built in Moscow, but its location was not further specified. A likely location would probably have been opposite the Kremlin, on the Sophie quay by the Moscow River.See e.g. Жизнь после смерти. За стеклом Life after death. Behind glass. The project was partly inspired by the Pantheon in Paris, and the idea was to transfer all the remains buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, and convert the Lenin Mausoleum into a monumental tribune overlooking Red Square. According to the decision, the Pantheon would be accessible to broad masses of visitors. The decision to build the Pantheon was never executed. Its fate may be connected with the turning point of Stalinist architectural projects after Stalin's death, and with the official condemnation of Joseph Stalin, whose body was removed from the Lenin MausoleumIn 1953-1961, the tomb was known as the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum. on October 31, 1961 and buried next to the Kremlin Wall as part of the process of De-Stalinization. The decision of 1953 was further invalidated on December 4, 1974, when the Ministerial Council of the Russian SFSR decided to formally protect the historical monuments of the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

Originally built in 1918 as SS Edgecombe by the Skinner and Eddy Corporation of Seattle, Washington for the United States Shipping Board, she was transferred to the United States Navy by Executive Order on 29 October 1921, delivered 16 November 1921, converted to a destroyer tender, and commissioned as USS Rigel on 24 February 1922 with Lieutenant E. G. Affleck in command. Service history =1922–1941= Following an extensive fitting out period and shakedown, Rigel was homeported at San Diego. During the interwar period she remained in southern California. During 1941, she was briefly re-designayed as ARb-1, (a base repair ship). =1941–1942= Redesignated a repair ship, AR-11, on 10 April 1941, she underwent overhaul at Bremerton, Washington then sailed to Hawaii for more extensive repairs and alterations. By mid-July, she was at Pearl Harbor and was still in the yard on 7 December 1941. She was without her authorized armament and superstructure and was slightly damaged during the Japanese attack. Her crew, unable to fire, immediately turned their skills to rescue and salvage operations. Conversion work on Rigel was completed on 7 April 1942. On 20 April, with four 3-inch guns mounted, she got underway for the South Pacific. Steaming first to Fanning Island, she disembarked U.S. Army units and material and embarked personnel of New Zealand's Pacific Island Force and civilian evacuees. On the 28th, she continued westward and on 16 May arrived at Auckland to add her equipment and personnel to the repair and construction facilities offered by that port. Between then and November she converted merchant ships and tugboats to Navy use, repaired other merchantmen, installed and repaired guns on merchant ships; trained armed guard crews, served as flagship for Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, and as store ship and receiving ship; provided printing facilities; assisted in the construction of shore facilities; and added ten 20 mm guns to her own armament, in addition to her assigned duties of repairing Allied warships and auxiliaries. In November, she was again called on to substitute as a transport. On the 8th, she embarked Army units and on the 9th, she sailed for New Caledonia. Arriving at Nouméa on 14 November, she shifted to Espiritu Santo two days later and contributed her skills to the Guadalcanal campaign. =1943–1944= In mid-January 1943, she shifted to Efate, and, on 24 April, got underway to return to the South Pacific where the 7th Amphibious Force was being formed. Rigel arrived at Sydney on 1 May, moved on to Brisbane on the 15th and until 14 June helped take the pressure off repair facilities there. But the 7th Amphibious Force's first assault landing was imminent and Rigel's assistance was needed in the forward area. On 21 June the repair ship arrived in Milne Bay, New Guinea, and on the 22nd Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, Commander, 7th Amphibious Force, raised his flag. On the 30th, the force landed troops on Woodlark and Kiriwina and the encirclement of Rabaul from the south was initiated. For the next 6½ months Rigel remained at Milne Bay, repairing ships from LSTs, LCIs, and MTBs to tankers, cruisers, and battleships. By December, Allied forces had moved up the coast to dispute control of Vitiaz and Dampier Straits. In December, landings were made on New Britain at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, and in January 1944, at Finschhafen and Saidor in New Guinea. Rigel, no longer Admiral Barbey's flagship, soon followed. Again bringing her vital equipment and trained men closer to the front, she moved to Cape Sudest, thence proceeded to Buna where her crew continued their round-the-clock schedule from 13 January until 9 June. From Buna she moved up the coast to Alexishafen, whence, in late August, she returned to Australia for a much needed overhaul. She was at Sydney during the initial thrust into the Philippines, but in November returned to New Guinea and continued her work at Hollandia, 22 November to 10 January 1945. On the latter date she got underway for the Philippines. =1945–1946= Rigel arrived in Leyte Gulf on 15 January. On the 16th she anchored in San Pedro Bay, where she remained through the end of the War. After brief postwar service, Rigel returned to the United States for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 11 July 1946 and was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal 12 July 1946, her final fate unknown. Rigel earned four battle stars during World War II.

While heading the National Quality Forum, Cassel was also paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by Kaiser Foundation Health Plans and Hospitals and Premier, Inc., which both had a stake in the NQF's decisions. A medical ethics expert called this \\"absolutely egregious.\\" According to a Newsweek reporter, the ABIM used obfuscatory accounting techniques during and after Cassel's tenure: \\"I had an easier time figuring out the compensation of officials at Enron, WorldCom and Adelphia—all famous for lying on financial filings—than I did for those at the ABIM, where enormous effort seems to have been taken to make murky what should be crystal clear.\\" The ABIM reportedly paid Cassel $1.7 million in her final year.

Pogue Company was a Cincinnati, Ohio based department store chain founded by two brothers, Henry and Samuel Pogue. They came from County Caven, Ireland to Cincinnati and worked in their uncle's dry goods store. They later were able to buy him out and H. & S. Pogue Dry Goods Company was established in 1863 at 111 West Fifth Street. Brothers Thomas, Joseph, and William Pogue would eventually join the enterprise.  Growing with the Queen City  The original storefront on West Fifth Street led to the Pogue brothers contracting to have their own store built on more fashionable Fourth Street between Race and Vine Streets directly across from Enin, McAlpin & Company, a location they would maintain through the company's history. The modest 31' storefront grew quickly, soon expanding into the buildings adjacent to it on each side. Renowned architect Samuel Hannaford was chosen to design the company's flagship store in 1916, expanding the enterprise westward to the corner of Race Street, the result being a graceful Edwardian structure with an impressive six acres of selling space. Publicity drawings were made of a completed store with the three original storefronts demolished and replaced with a never-to-occur expansion of the Hannaford-designed structure. The downtown store would be expanded again, despite the Great Depression, in 1930 when an alley was removed to provide a new nine-story mechanical and ventilation tower that included ten service and passenger elevators connecting the building's 11 floors of two basements, six above-ground selling floors, and three service/storage levels. The structure also served to functionally connect the store northward into the arcade of the new Carew Tower, where Pogue's would occupy the southern side, the northern side and several floors above it being occupied by long-time competitor Mabley & Carew, which had been displaced by the Tower's construction. In 1948, the 12-story, 110,000 square foot, Service Building would be constructed a block south of the store at the corner of Third and Race Streets, housing the growing business's clothing alterations, carpet, drapery, millinery (Pogue's creations regularly come up for sale on eBay), and upholstery workrooms; the print shop; fur storage; engraving and silver polishing; and watch repair. Sensitive to the building's location on a prominent street in the heart of the financial district, the firm selected respected Cincinnati architect Henry Hake to craft a striking, modernist tower similar in design to the Terrace Plaza Hotel three blocks north of it and completed the same year. Hake and Son's other notable Cincinnati commissions included the Cincinnati Reds' Crosley Field, the Queen City Club, and the headquarters for the Western and Southern Life Insurance Company. A three-story warehouse, primarily for furniture and appliances, was maintained at Sixth and Cutter Streets in an area of the downtown Cincinnati street grid that would vanish with the construction of Interstate 75 and its off-ramps as the highway crosses the Ohio River. Suburban expansion came in April 1959 with the opening of a 60,000 square foot boutique-style branch at Kenwood Plaza and construction underway of a 160,000 square foot full-scale branch store at Tri-County Center. As the decade drew to its close, Pogue's was firmly established as the region's finest department store, and second- largest after the John Shillito Company. However, it was already apparent that the changes reshaping post-war America, with shoppers steadily moving to the suburbs and preferring automobiles rather than public transportation, were leading to the end of the single-location department store in an urban center. Further suburban expansion and a downtown garage were critical to the business's success, and expensive. The decision was made in 1961 to sell the business to Associated Dry Goods, an affiliation of upscale department stores founded in 1911 by several New York City-area retailers headed by Lord & Taylor. Other divisions at the time of the Pogue's sale included Hahne & Company (Newark NJ), J.W. Robinson (Los Angeles), The Diamond (Charleston WV), William Hengerer Company (Buffalo), and Sibley, Lindsey, & Curr (Rochester). Locally, Shillito's had been a unit of Federated Department Stores, forerunner of today's Macy's, since the 1930s, and, in 1960, long-time competitor Mabley & Carew had sold out to Allied Stores, then one of the nation's largest department store chains with well-known divisions including Jordan Marsh (Boston), Maas Brothers (Tampa), Miller & Rhoads (Richmond), and, regionally, the William Block Company (Indianapolis), Polsky's (Akron), and The Fashion (Columbus). At the time of the sale to Associated Dry Goods, the H&S; Pogue Company employed approximately 1,200 persons and the layout of the store was as follows: Sub-Basement: Delivery Wrapping, Employee Locker Rooms. Basement: Budget Store - Women's Accessories, Clothing, Coats, Hosiery, Lingerie, Millinery, and Sportswear; Infants; Children's Clothing; and Men's Furnishings. Main Floor: Candy, Clocks, Epicure, Fine Silver, Florist, Hosiery, Gifts, Gloves, Jewelry, Leather Goods, Men's Furnishings, Notions, Service Desk (Information and Cashiers), Stationary, Tobacconist, Toilet Goods (Cosmetics), Umbrellas, Watches, Women's Budget Blouses and Millinery, Women's Shoes. 2nd Floor: Children's Clothing and Shoes, Domestics, Gift Wrap, Infants/Layette, Laces and Trimmings, Linens, Men's Coats and Suits, Men's Shoes, Men's Restroom, Patterns, Portrait Studio, Ribbons, Yard Goods (Fabrics). 3rd Floor: Bridal Salon, Fashion Office (Special Events, Cincy-Hi and Collegiate Fashion Boards), Fur Salon, Juniors, Lingerie, Maternity Shop, Millinery, Robes, Rose Room Restaurant, Wedding Consultant, Women's Clothing and Sportswear, Women's Restroom. 4th Floor: Art Needlework, Better Homes & Gardens Home Planning Center, Bridal Registry, China and Crystal, Draperies, Glassware, Lamps, Rugs, Toys. 5th Floor: Auditing, Bedding, Books and Rental Library, Furniture, Interior Design Studio, Luggage, Pictures and Mirrors. 6th Floor: Accounting, Adjustments, Appliances, Buying Offices, Cashiers, Check Cashing, Customer Lounge, Executive Offices, Housewares, Jane Alden (Mail and Telephone Order Service), Paints, Records, Travel Bureau, Unfinished Furniture, Will Call, Women's Rest Room. 7th Floor: Advertising, Beauty Salon, Credit Union, Employee Cafeteria, First Aid, Maintenance, Operations, Personnel, Sales Promotions, Security, Staff Training. 8th Floor: Receiving and Marking. 9th Floor: Competitive Shoppers, Sign Shop, Visual Merchandising  Associated Dry Goods and gradual decline  Change came quickly after the sale to Associated Dry Goods in 1962. The downtown store was expanded that year into the first two floors of the former Mabley & Carew space in the Carew Tower Arcade, as Mabley's relocated to the former Rollman Brother's store across Fifth Street. A Cincinnati tradition was born when a bridge across the second level of the arcade was constructed to connect the two Pogue spaces, with the Ice Cream Bridge featuring local favorite Graeter's Ice Creams. \\"The Bridge\\" was an instant hit, with a version added to the Tri-County store opening directly into the shopping mall. An enormous parking garage with space for 1,600 cars (it would remain Cincinnati's largest privately-owned garage until its demolition in 2017) was constructed across Race Street with a covered walkway into the store's second floor. Each level of the garage was named after a flavor of ice cream available on the Ice Cream Bridge to help shoppers remember where they parked. The lower, street, and second floors of the downtown store were redecorated in a contemporary French Provincial style by the famed architectural firm of Raymond Loewy Associates, highly respected for their futuristic Lord & Taylor stores in the New York, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C. suburbs. A chic new restaurant, the Camargo Room, was added on the store's sixth floor in time for the 1964 Christmas Season, replacing the more traditional Rose Room on the third floor. Similar to Lord & Taylor's Birdcage Restaurants, ads promoting the restaurant made it clear that the Camargo Room was a new, modern style of department store dining far removed from the traditional tea room, with a limited menu, faster service, and fixed prices. It was also made clear that cigarette smoking by women was welcome. The room proved so popular that a Camargo Restaurant was added to the Tri- County store. Kenwood Plaza would be expanded in 1965-66 to nearly 200,000 square feet with a new second floor that allowed men's wear, children's wear, a Camargo Restaurant, home store, and beauty salon to be added, all served by a new three-level parking garage connecting shoppers to both levels of the store. After their success with the downtown store, Raymond Loewy & Associates were selected for the work. Kenwood Plaza would remain the largest and most successful Pogue's branch store through the chain's existence, and by 1980 was surpassing the downtown store in annual sales with a third the square footage. Efforts to update the Pogue image were apparent in 1970 when suburban expansion continued with a 153,000 square foot three-level store in Northgate Mall. The palatial design of the Kenwood and Tri-County stores with their gleaming white brick, floodlit exteriors and generous landscaping was dropped in favor of a Modernist design with a striking exterior entranceway, a glass elevator, and a more casual concept dining option called The Balcony. In 1972, the components of Pogue's end-game would start to take shape when ADG purchased L.S. Ayres (13 stores) and Stewart Dry Goods (7 stores) based in nearby Indianapolis and Louisville, respectively. Unlike the other ADG regional carriage trade chains, L.S. Ayres and Stewart's were the mid-market, dominant department stores in their marketplaces, more similar to Shillito's in Cincinnati. ADG now had a 25-store cluster of stores across the Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky tristate, and cost synergies between the three, while operating independently, began to be implemented. As one of the two smallest chains within ADG, Pogue's was often the test ground for new CEO's and a parade of young store leaders on two to three year rotations would become commonplace in the Executive Office, unsettling to staff who had worked for up to five generations of Pogue family members. Efforts to update the brand were evident in the 1972 holiday catalogue, which featured a caftan-clad woman strumming a guitar rather than Pogue's traditional Christmas-themed illustrated covers. The creation of a series of second level walkways, or Skywalks in the local usage, in the early 1970’s benefited the downtown Pogue's store more advantageously than its rivals. To the west, the store was connected into the new Cincinnati Plaza Hotel, soon renamed the Westin Cincinnati, and Fifth/Third Center. To the south across Fourth Street, a Skywalk connected Pogue's second floor with that of competitor McAlpin's. To the north across Fifth Street, a Skywalk led to Mabley & Carew department store, the Terrace Hilton Hotel, the Skywalk Twin Cinemas, and a variety of restaurants. An existing bridge to the west connected the store to its 11-story parking garage, with the result that Pogue's second floor became a crossroads for downtown workers and tourists with a cross-current of shoppers that, especially at lunchtime, revitalized the aging store. Pogue's store planners carved out a series of shops along the Skywalks, including Pogue's Fine Services (fur storage, dry cleaning, and shoe repair) on the garage Skywalk, and Flowers by Pogue's on the Fifth Street Skywalk. An innovative, forwarding-looking redesign of the Downtown store saw the Fourth and Race Street show windows removed and the sales floor made visible to the street to showcase the Fourth Street Market with updated Housewares and Epicure departments, including a branch of the local Servatti's Bakery. Le Petit Cafe', an upscale food bar that featured a variety of pates, salads, and wines, would hold the same appeal for a new generation of fashionable Cincinnati shoppers that the Camargo Room had for their mothers in a more genteel era. Fourth Street Market gave the downtown store renewed vitality and a bustling lunchtime crowd that would, ironically, outlast Pogue's itself. As shoppers continued to migrate to the suburbs, the 1970s also saw the closure of the downtown store's basement sales level, which became the new Receiving facility. Juniors was moved to the Main Floor, and many departments were discontinued including Appliances, Books, Draperies, the Home Planning Center, Paints, Records, and Toys. The Service Building was closed with the surviving workrooms incorporated into the newly-vacant store space or outsourced. The Camargo Room added a quick-service Soup & Salad Bar in the former Customer Lounge modeled on a similar space at Lord & Taylor's Manhattan flagship. The final Pogue's branch store would open in 1976, a modest 112,000 square foot location in Florence Mall, the chain's only venture into Kentucky and the only one without a furniture department or restaurant. As ADG continued to attempt to update its Pogue's unit in the late 1970s, Tri-County's Ice Cream Parlor would be moved into the store and reformatted to the Le Petite Café format which had proven so successful in the Downtown store. As the 1970s drew to a close, the Pogue's chain seemed destined for success with premier locations in the city's five top retail markets, most notably in a revitalized downtown Cincinnati. But a harbinger of the difficult decade ahead was in 1978 when the Mabley & Carew stores, a rival of Pogue's dating to 1877, were purchased by Dayton-based Elder-Beerman and converted to their nameplate. Twenty years later, a Cincinnati retail landscape that had lasted a century would have vanished.  Merger and Closure  As the Ohio Valley suffered in the recession of the early 1980s, compounded by the deindustrialization of the Great Lakes region, Pogue's profits suffered. The downtown store, in particular, had suffered severe sales declines since 1983 when a city- subsidized Saks Fifth Avenue opened directly across Race Street. Saks' demands that Pogue's reduce their Race Street loading docks dramatically hurt the viability of the downtown store which had served as the receiving and distribution center for all five stores. A new standalone receiving facility in northern Kentucky added to the expenses of the H.& S. Pogue Company division, and in 1983 Pogue's was merged into their Indianapolis ADG sister division L.S. Ayres & Company in a successful effort to keep both struggling chains afloat. ADG's annual report to its shareholders would note that the first full year of the merger saw sales increase 22%, and profits nearly 50%, at the five Cincinnati-area stores, with market share being moved from all three major competitors (by then Elder-Beerman, McAlpin’s, and ShillitoRikes). The merger had been anticipated by ADG senior management for several years, with the Pogue's and L.S. Ayres logos each being modified for consistency between both chains, and Pogue's merchandise assortment being down-scaled throughout the early 1980s to the more mid-market range of L.S. Ayres. The corporate merger was accomplished with little fanfare and L.S. Ayres continued to operate the former Pogue locations with minimal changes for an additional three years. The Fourth Street Market continued to be so popular in the former Pogue's locations that the concept was incorporated into larger L.S. Ayres stores and a private label line of wines and gourmet foods, \\"Fourth Street Market,\\" developed. Larger L.S. Ayres stores would also incorporate Pogue's successful Center for the Executive Woman, which had been noteworthy enough to earn the cover of an ADG annual report of the period. With shopping habits changing and the age of the carriage trade department store slowly drawing to a close, ADG merged L.S. Ayres and Louisville's Stewart Dry Goods in 1985 in yet another effort to keep the regional chains profitable. In October 1986, ADG was itself acquired for US$2.2 billion by May Department Stores in the largest retail merger in the United States to that date. A few months later, long-time competitor John Shillito Company, by then trading as ShillitoRikes after a merger with its Dayton sister chain Rike Kuhmler Company, was merged into Columbus-based F. & R. Lazarus, and the iconic Shillito name also disappeared from Cincinnati's retail landscape. The last local Cincinnati department store would vanish a decade later when McAlpin's would be purchased by Arkansas-based Dillard's along with its Mercantile Stores sister divisions. Within months of their purchase of ADG, May Department Stores exited the Cincinnati market. The Kenwood Plaza, Tri-County Center, and Northgate Mall locations were sold to JCPenney, the Florence Mall store to Hess Brothers, and the downtown store closed. The Samuel Hannaford-designed building on Fourth Street was demolished to make way for Tower Place Mall, which would eventually fail and close in 2012 to be converted to a parking garage for the Netherland Plaza Hotel. The street level of the Carew Tower sections of the store was subdivided into various retail spaces and restaurants. After a few less than glamorous years as a JCPenney, Pogue's showplace Kenwood Plaza store would be converted to a branch of upscale Alabama-based Parisian Stores in 1993. Parisian Stores were purchased by North Carolina-based Belk in 2007. Choosing not to enter the Cincinnati market, Belk sold the location to Nordstrom, which demolished the store for a new location that, as of 2020, is still operating. The Tri-County Center store was gutted with the first level converted into a new mall entrance, a BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, and an Ethan Allen furniture store, and the second level empty as of 2020. The Northgate Mall store was demolished in 2008 to make way for a cinema complex. Ironically, only the smallest Pogue's location continues as a department store as of 2020: The Florence Mall location sold to Hess's in 1988 would, in 1993, become a Home Store site for the F.& R. Lazarus division of Federated Department Stores, with all Lazarus stores being rebranded as Macy's in 2005. As of 2019, the Service Building is the sole remaining downtown remnant of the original four-building Pogue complex, but is vacant. A proposal for its sale for redevelopment was announced in mid-August 2020 with an asking price of $5.1 million. A Facebook page for fans and former employees of the H. & S. Pogue Company was started in 2010 as \\"H&S; Pogue Company of Cincinnati.\\" As of 2020, the page numbers over 900 fans including descendants of both Henry and Samuel Pogue.

It was different from the standard UK work permit scheme in that applicants did not need a specific job offer in the UK. It has now been replaced by Tier 1 (General) of the new points-based immigration system for those who are already living in the UK with HSMP and Tier 2 for those who are currently living outside of the UK or living in the UK in a different immigration category. History The Highly Skilled Migrant Programme was introduced on 28 January 2002. The scheme was significantly changed in two ways. First, with effect from 3 April 2006 (Immigration rule change - HC 1016) HSMP visa holders who were previously guaranteed settlement after four years now had to wait five years before applying for ILR. Secondly, on 7 November 2006 (with changes taking effect from 8 November 2006), with a points-based assessment for new applicants and those wishing to extend their stay (FLR) being introduced. This prompted protests, with many HSMP visa holders fearing that the retrospective nature of the changes will force them out of the UK,Skilled migrant workers protest, BBC News, 11 January 2007, accessed 26 August 2007 and the joint House of Commons and House of Lords Human Rights Committee criticizing the retrospective nature of the changes for breaching human rights legislationTougher migrant rules 'illegal', BBC News, 8 August 2007, accessed 26 August 2007 and finding that the case to revisit the retrospective nature of the changes was \\"overwhelming\\".Joint Committee on Human Rights: Twentieth Report of 2007 The application of these HSMP changes to those already in the UK as HSMP holders as at 7 November 2006 was ruled as unlawful in a judicial review HSMP Forum Ltd, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department and the UK Border Agency subsequently honoured the FLR outcome of the judicial review, implementing a remedy which allowed impacted migrants, including those who left the country, to apply to have leave under the new points-based UK immigration system instated in place of their lost HSMP leave.UK Border Agency HSMP Forum judicial review HSMP replacement: (Tier 1 General) In March 2008, the HSMP programme was replaced by Tier 1 (General) of the new points- based immigration system.UK Border Agency: Who Should Apply for Tier 1 Immigration The system remains similar to the previous HSMP system, with additional points required for Maintenance/Savings, and additional points for English language ability. HSMP and Indefinite Leave To Remain HSMP Forum won the ILR Review on 6 April 2009. According to the High Court Decision, the HSMP visa holders who were admitted under the HSMP scheme before the April 2006 changes will now get the Indefinite leave to remain after 4 years as originally promised to them as per the terms valid at that time, but the HSMP visa holders who admitted after April 2006 changes will get it after 5 years as per new terms.  Points system  The HSMP system was a points-based immigration scheme, requiring a minimum of 75 points to qualify. From 8 November 2006 until closure points were awarded for educational qualifications (maximum of 50 points), past earnings based on a country banding system (45), age (20) and UK experience (5). Applicants also had to demonstrate English language ability and that they had sufficient funds to maintain themselves in the UK.

(). =Armenian exile= Topal Osman was known to have been responsible for massacres against Armenians and Greeks during the Ottoman civil war in the Pontus region where he was stationed during World War I. While in Trabzon, Osman made a name for himself in the spring of 1915 as commander of a squadron of gangs.Raymond Kévorkian, The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History, I.B.Tauris, 2011, , p. 221.

He is seen as one of the key perpetrators of the Greek Genocide, particularly in the northern region of Turkey historically known as Pontus. According to Mustafa Kemal's recent biographer Robert Shenk of the US Naval Institute, Topal Osman was a \\"sadistic ethnic cleanser of Armenians and Greeks.\\"Shenk, R.

Out of anger for this refusal, Topal Osman sacked some houses in a Christian neighborhood before being forced out of the city by armed Turkish port workers and officials. Together with his subsequent murder of Trabzon deputy Ali Şükrü Bey (leader of the first Turkish opposition party) this led to long standing animosity between the nationalist government of Mustafa Kemal and the population of Trabzon.Twice a Stranger: The Mass Expulsions that Forged Modern Greece and Turkey, p.112-116 Bruce Clark, 2006, Harvard University Press. =Koçgiri Rebellion= =Murder of Ali Şükrü Bey = For his work in the national movement, Osman became commander of Mustafa Kemal's special Bodyguard Regiment.Taner Akçam, A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility, , p. 341-2.

This was for the Maraş crimes committed by Topal Osman. Osman was surrounded at his hideout in Seyran Bağları wards, and in the resulting exchange of fire, was wounded and captured on 1 April 1923. Later that day, under İsmail Hakkı's orders, he was executed by a shot to the head. On 2 April, at the insistence of the \\"Second Group\\", his body was dug up and hung at the gate of the parliament building (today War of Independence Museum) for exhibition to the public.Ergün Aybars, İstiklâl Mahkemeleri: 1923-1927, Kültür ve Türizm Bakanlığı, 1982, p. 14.

It has small fruit clusters with small berries that do not have the pronounced 'foxiness' of other V. labrusca grapes. It is a slip-skin variety, meaning that the skin is easily separated from the fruit. The grapes are used to make wines including dry, sweet, icewine but is famed for spicy sparkling wines that do not have much of the objectionable foxiness character that other V. labrusca grapes contribute to their wines.http://wine.appellationamerica.com/grape-varietal/Delaware.html The wine is light pink to white in colour. It is a commercially viable grape vine which is grown in the Northeast and Midwest United States, and is vigorous when grafted onto a Phylloxera-resistant root stock. The Delaware grape is susceptible to downy mildew and ripens earlier than 'Concord'. The Delaware grape is also a table grape variety sold in supermarkets throughout South Korea and Japan, where V. labrusca grape varieties are popular for their fragrance. Delaware Punch is named for the Delaware grape from which its flavor is primarily derived.  History  The Delaware grape was probably discovered in Frenchtown, New Jersey, but was first brought to public notice by Abram Thomson, of Delaware, Ohio, in the 1850s. Although it is said to be an American variety, its parentage is unknown and is thought to have a significant Vitis vinifera component in its background, possibly explaining the susceptibility to fungal diseases and the requirement for grafting onto Phylloxera-resistant root stock for best growth.http://www.wineloverspage.com/wineguest/wgg.html#delaware T.V.

Newman Cigar Company was established in 1895 and is the oldest family-owned premium cigar maker in the United States. It was founded in Cleveland, Ohio by Julius Caeser Newman, an Austro-Hungarian immigrant (born in todays Slovakian city Trebišov). The business relocated to a historic 1910 cigar factory (Regensburg cigar factory) in the Cigar City of Ybor City, Florida in 1954. The family business is now in its fourth generation. J.C. Newman Cigar Company's long history dates back more than a century to 1895, when Julius Caeser Newman rolled his first cigars in the family barn in Cleveland, Ohio.  Family Legacy  At the young age of 14, Julius Caeser Newman (J.C.), became a cigar maker apprentice in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1890, the Newmans were recent immigrants to the United States and J.C.'s mother, Hannah, paid $3.00 per month so that he could learn the cigar trade. After completing his apprenticeship, J.C. worked as a journeyman cigar maker for the next 3 years until a severe recession resulted in massive layoffs throughout the country. As an unemployed immigrant cigar maker, J.C. decided to follow the “American Dream” and start his own company. Though his dreams of success were great, the company's beginnings were quite simple. In 1895, J.C. created a cigar table from some old boards, borrowed $50 for tobacco, and received his first order for 500 cigars from the family grocer. The business that started that day in the barn behind the family home was the J.C. Newman Cigar Company. J.C.’s first brand of cigars was called “A.B.C.,” an acronym that stood for “Akron, Bedford and Cleveland,” which was the name of a local streetcar line. Over the years, J.C. was married and had four children. By 1916, the company had rapidly expanded with the addition of two factories in Marion and Lorain, Ohio, and then employed a total of 700 employees. J.C.’s top-selling cigar brand was called Judge Wright, with its famous slogan, “A fair trial will give a verdict in favor of this cigar.” However, the cigar business was difficult during the Great Depression. After World War II, J.C.’s sons, Stanford and Millard Newman, returned from military service and joined the company. Stanford was responsible for the cigar manufacturing operations and Millard oversaw the company’s sales. As America prospered, the Newmans’ company continued to flourish in Cleveland selling its then famous, Student Prince cigars. The company joined the Tampa cigar manufacturing community in 1954 when J.C. determined that the company's future lay in the manufacture of premium cigars. He resolved to relocate to Tampa, which enjoyed a world-class reputation for producing high-quality premium cigars. The move also brought him closer to his primary source of tobacco: Cuba. Interestingly, in the early part of the 19th century, more hand-rolled Clear Havana cigars – cigars made entirely of Cuban tobacco – had been made in Tampa than were made in Cuba and imported in the United States. Prior to uprooting his whole life and company, J.C. sent his son Stanford to find a new factory and begin trial operations. Stanford found an ideal manufacturing location at a landmark cigar factory in Ybor City, Tampa's central cigar- making district founded in 1886 by legendary Cuban revolutionary Vincent Ybor. Built in 1910, the Regensburg factory was one of the last and largest cigar factories ever built in Tampa. Like every cigar factory in town, the Regensburg had a nickname: El Reloj, Spanish for “The Clock.” For generations, residents had risen and retired to the hourly chimes ringing from its tall brick clock tower. After decades of silence, the landmark El Reloj now rings again thanks to a loving restoration by the Newman family in 2002. Exterior of Factory from Roof Stanford knew that if the company was going to continue to be successful, he would need to acquire an existing premium brand. So, five months after the death of his father in 1958, Stanford purchased the internationally renowned Cuesta-Rey brand from Karl and Anch Cuesta. After gaining title to Cuesta-Rey, when every other Tampa cigar manufacturer was marketing their standard palma shape cigar for 26¢, Stanford created a novel package for his Cuesta-Rey palma cigars — two bundles of 25 cigars packed in the round and placed in luxurious aromatic cedar cabinets. The legendary 35¢ Cuesta-Rey #95 cigar was born. In 1961 when the enactment of the Cuban Embargo made it impossible for Tampa's cigar manufacturers to obtain their critical tobaccos, Stanford was a visionary. As a 25-year veteran cigar manufacturer at the time, he searched the world for a high quality, flavorful wrapper leaf to replace his historic Cuban tobacco. He discovered Cameroon wrapper leaves of West Africa. Cameroon wrapper was similar to Cuban tobacco in appearance, but with better burning qualities and an exceptional taste all its own. In 1963 he became the first premium cigar manufacturer to introduce Cameroon tobacco to America. Even though it cost twice the price of Cuban tobacco, it was Cameroon wrapper that was primarily responsible for making Cuesta-Rey one of the largest selling premium cigars in the country. Three weeks after the leveraged buy-out was completed, fellow Tampa cigar maker, Carlos Fuente, Sr. called Stanford with a proposition. Carlos wanted to close his Tampa factory and concentrate his efforts on his handmade factory in the Dominican Republic. He asked if Stanford would be interested in making his Tampa factory brands to which he agreed, provided that Carlos made handmade cigars for J.C. Newman Cigar Co. The first brand under the new partnership, La Unica Dominican Primeros, became the number one selling premium bundle cigar in American within 6 months of its launch. Shortly after, production of Cuesta-Rey was moved to the Fuente's Dominican factory and enjoyed similar success. In 1990, J.C. Newman Cigar Co. became the distributor of Carlos’ Arturo Fuente and Montesino brands expanding sales across the United States, a partnership which continues on today. Today, a new generation continues the Newman family tradition under brothers Eric Newman, president, and Bobby Newman, executive vice president. In 2017, Eric's son, Drew, became the first member of the fourth generation to join the business full-time as the company's General Counsel. The business that young J.C. founded more than a century ago is stronger than ever. Diamond Crown is a highly prized cigar as well as a bestselling brand of humidors and cigar accessories. Cuesta-Rey is one of the most popular premium cigars in the world, enjoyed by cigar smokers in 61 countries on six continents. The Brick House launch exceeded all expectations and has been named one of the Top 25 cigars in the world by Cigar Aficionado. Quorum is the world's most popular handmade cigar sold in bundles. From our humble beginnings as a one-man cigar factory, we have survived and prospered through the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, two world wars, the Cuban embargo, excessive taxes, smoking bans and the rapid consolidation of the cigar industry. In 1895, there were 40,000 federally licensed cigar manufacturers in the United States. Four generations and nearly 125 years later, J.C. Newman is the only one that is still owned and operated by the founding family. As J.C. Newman Cigar Company continues in the 21st century, the Newman family is committed to upholding the family tradition of quality and innovation and hand-crafting some of the world's finest cigars. Company overview J.C. Newman Cigar Company manufactures and distributes premium cigars. As a Austro-Hungarian immigrant (born in todays Slovakia), J.C. Newman rolled his first cigars in the family barn in Cleveland in 1895. In 1954, the company moved to Tampa's Ybor City cigar district to be closer to Cuba. J.C. Newman is also the worldwide distributor for Arturo Fuente cigars, except for Western Europe. Today, J.C. Newman's cigars are sold in 80 countries around the world.

The first half consists of Paulsen's early experiences running sled dogs in Minnesota and then in Alaska, and the second half describes the roads and animals he faces in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Plot summary Paulsen opens his book with a vivid retelling of a story in which he watched brush wolves kill and devour a live doe in the woods. This event revealed the raw, unfabricated realities of nature to him. Paulsen recounts many incidents he has undergone with his dogs on their runs, including times he has been carried to safety by his sled dogs after breaking his knee on the trail, became violently ill in the midst of extreme cold conditions, and a variety of mysterious happenings in the Alaskan wilderness. In all of their adventures, he bonds closely with his dogs, particularly one named \\"Storm\\". Storm was an ideal dog that taught Paulsen many life values. Part One closes, and Part Two begins with Paulsen entering a team of fifteen of his dogs in the Iditarod Sled Dog Race, an approximately 1,153.2 mile-long sled dog race from Anchorage, Alaska to Nome, Alaska. The race proves to be long and arduous. Extreme cold conditions and difficult terrain put both he and his team to the test. He is repeatedly afflicted by lifelike hallucinations caused by extreme sleep deprivation, such as a man with a trench coat talking about educational grants, and hallucinating about a man hallucinating. But Gary is spurred onward by the beauty of the race and his devotion to the team. During the race, Gary experiences a unique feeling when he is running with his dogs. After nearly seventeen days, he at last crosses the finish line in Nome. He places last in the race, but the accomplishment and adventure are all that matter to him.

Long was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 31st round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft. He played in the Royals system for eight seasons, from 1989 until 1996. Long led Class-A Eugene in 1989 in games played, at bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, and RBIs. He also ranked eighth among all Northwest League hitters with his .312 batting average in his rookie season. He missed most of the 1994 season after undergoing surgery on his left wrist. Coaching career At the end of spring training in 1997, Long, who was assigned to the Triple-A Omaha Royals, decided to retire, asking instead for a coaching job. Long made his professional managing debut with the Class-A Wilmington Blue Rocks in 1997. He was named the Northwest League's co-Manager of the Year after leading the Spokane Indians to the league title in 1999. Long served as the hitting coach in the Royals organization with the Double-A Wichita Wranglers (2000–01) and Triple-A Omaha Royals (2002–03). He became the hitting coach for the Yankees' Triple-A team, the Columbus Clippers, from 2004 to 2006. Long was promoted to hitting coach for the New York Yankees in 2007.

The 968 runs were the most in franchise history since 1937 (979). His offense also featured the American League MVP Alex Rodriguez, three Silver Sluggers (Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada and Rodriguez) and four of the American League's top-15 batting averages. After a down year offensively in 2008, Long's Yankee hitters again led the league in offense during the 2009 season, in which they also won the franchise's 27th World Series title, and led the American League in runs again. Following the 2010 season, the Yankees signed Long to a three-year contract. He was fired following the 2014 season.http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/writer/jon-heyman/24747505/sources- yankees-fire-well-repected-hitting-coach-kevin-long He was then hired by the New York Mets to be their hitting coach. Long most recently has been hired as of November 2nd 2017 by the Washington Nationals to be their hitting coach. Personal life When Long was still a player (though he does not remember which year), he suffered an accident during an offseason job with a drywall company, when a 25-pound sledgehammer hit him in the left eye, shattering three bones.

He played college football at Howard University. Wilson was most recently the assistant defensive backs/special teams coach for the DC Defenders of the XFL. He was the former head football coach at his alma mater Howard University, from 1989 to 2001, and Texas Southern University, from 2004 to 2007. Early years Wilson attended Northern High School where he played defensive back and wide receiver. He was invited to the North-South Senior All-Star Game as a senior. He accepted a scholarship to play for Howard University, where he focused on playing wide receiver. As a senior, he set single-season school records for catches (94), receiving yards (1,339), touchdown receptions (12) and kickoff returns (40). He graduated as the school's all-time leading receiver and kick returner. In 2013, he was inducted into the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference hall of fame. In 2012, he received MEAC/SWAC Challenge Legend honors. He also was inducted into the Black College Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Wilson was not selected in the 1979 NFL Draft and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. Although he was initially waived on August 14, he was re- signed on August 29 for depth purposes, after Butch Johnson was injured. He led the team in punt returns as a rookie. He was converted into a cornerback in his second season, with 11 starts, 48 tackles, 4 interceptions and 41 passes defensed (led the team). In 1981, he started 4 games before being replaced with rookie Everson Walls, who received Pro Bowl honors at the end of the season. In 1982, he was moved back to wide receiver before being released on September 3. =Denver Broncos= Wilson signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos on September 14, 1982, after Steve Foley broke his arm in the first game of the season. In 1983, he started 3 games after injuries to Foley and Dennis Smith, forced the team to make changes in the defensive backfield. In 1985, he started four of the first five games because of injuries and finished with 3 interceptions, 12 passes defensed and a fumble recovery. In 1987, he started at right cornerback the last 5 regular season games and all the playoff games, including Super Bowl XXII. He was waived on August, 29, 1988, only to be re-signed on September 28, after the team experienced a rash of injuries. During his time with the Broncos he was a dependable player (missing 4 games) and although he was used primarily as a backup, he was always among the team leaders in interceptions, finishing his career ranked ninth (16) in franchise history. Coaching career Wilson led the Howard Bison football team to the Mideastern Athletic Conference and Black College National championship twice (1993, 1996). His 1993 team had an 11-0 record and qualified for the school's first Division 1-AA (now FCS) playoff appearance. His coaching record was 78 wins, 67 losses and received MEAC Coach of the Year honors twice (1989, 1993). He spent three seasons as the defensive coordinator for Bowie State University. In 2004, he was hired as the head coach of Texas Southern. His coaching record was 4 wins, 40 losses. In 2019, he was named the special teams coordinator and defensive backs coach for the DC Defenders of the XFL.

It is easily pollinated by insects; in culture, mainly by the common honey bee, Apis mellifera. Overview P. guajava fruit Widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, guava fruits can range in size from as small as an apricot to as large as a grapefruit. Various cultivars have white, pink, or red flesh, and a few also feature red (instead of green or yellow) skin. When cultivated from seed, guavas are notable for an extremely slow growth rate for several months, before a very rapid acceleration in growth rate takes over. From seed, common guavas may bloom and set fruit in as few as two years or as many as eight. Cuttings, grafting, and air layering are more commonly used as a propagation method in commercial groves. Highly adaptable, guavas can be easily grown as container plants in temperate regions, though their ability to bloom and set fruit is somewhat less predictable. In some tropical locations, guavas can become invasive. It has become a major problem in the Galápagos Islands.http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/SA/Ecuador/Galapagos/ScalesiaSantaCruz.htm The plant is used in many different shampoo products for its scent. It is also becoming a popular bonsai species and is currently quite popular in India and Eastern Asia. Red guava Psidium guajava The flowers of Psidium guajava.

In the case of \\"top-fermenting\\" ale yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the yeast creates a \\"kreuzen\\" on the top of the liquid, unlike \\"bottom-fermenting\\" lager yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) where the yeast falls to the bottom of the brewing vessel. Process Cell aggregation occurs throughout microbiology, in bacteria, filamentous algae, fungi and yeast.(Lewin, 1984; Stratford, 1992) Yeast are capable of forming three aggregates; mating aggregates, for DNA exchange; chain formation; and flocs as a survival strategy in adverse conditions.(Calleja, 1987) Industrial brewing strains rarely mate. Therefore, only chain formation and flocculation are of relevance to the brewing industry. Yeast flocculation is distinct from agglomeration (‘grit’ formation), which is irreversible and occurs most commonly in baker's yeast when strains fail to separate when resuspended. (Guinard and Lewis, 1993) Agglomeration only occurs following the pressing and rehydration of yeast cakes and both flocculent and non-flocculent yeast strains have been shown to demonstrate agglomeration.(Guinard and Lewis, 1993) It is also distinct from the formation of biofilms, which occur on a solid substrate. Louis Pasteur is erroneously credited with first describing flocculation of brewer’s yeast. Brewer's yeast flocculation has been the subject of many reviews.(Stewart et al., 1975; Stewart and Russell, 1986; Calleja, 1987; Speers et al., 1992; Jin and Speers, 1999) Flocculation has been defined as the reversible, non-sexual aggregation of yeast cells that may be dispersed by specific sugars(Burns, 1937; Lindquist, 1953, Eddy, 1955; Masy et al., 1992 or EDTA.(Burns, 1937; Lindquist, 1953) The addition of nutrients other than sugars has been demonstrated not to reverse flocculation.(Soares et al., 2004) This is as opposed to mating aggregates formed as a prelude to sexual fusion between complementary yeast cells.(Calleja, 1987) For flocculation to occur the yeast must be flocculent and certain environmental conditions(such as agitation, absence of sugars, a microamount of Ca2+, ethanol, etc.; Jin and Speers 1999) must be present. Several factors are important in cell-to-cell binding such as surface charge, hydrophobic effects and zymolectin interactions.(see following) The importance of these forces in brewing yeast flocculation was unrecognized in the past but work by Speers et al. (2006)Speers, R.A., Wan, Y-Q., Jin, Y-L., and R. J. Stewart, R.J. 2006. Effects of fermentation parameters and cell wall properties on yeast flocculation. J. Inst. Brew. 112:246-254. have indicated the importance of zymolectin and hydrophobic interactions. As the cells are too large to be moved by Brownian motion, for binding of two or more cells to occur the cells must be subjected to low level of agitation. Zymolectin interaction theory The accepted mechanism of flocculation involves a protein-carbohydrate model.(Miki et al., 1982) (figure 1.3) Fully flocculent yeast cells exhibit carbohydrate α-mannan receptors and protein zymolectins.(section 1.5.4) Zymolectins are so termed as they may not be true bivalent lectins.(Speers, Smart, Stewart and Jin,1998)Speers, R.A., Smart, K., Stewart, R., Jin, Y-L., 1998. Zymolectins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Letter J. Inst. Brew., 104:298. It has been suggested that zymolectin interactions between the protein and mannan moities results in the flocculation phenotype(section 4.1) with Ca2+ ions required for the correct conformation of the zymolectins. Co-flocculation between Kluyveromyces and Schizosaccharomyces has been shown to be by a “lectinic” mechanism.(El-Behhari et al., 2000) This theory explains the essential role of calcium and how deproteinisation affects flocculation. =Flocculation zymolectins and phenotypes= Three flocculation phenotypes have been elucidated based on the zymolectins they produce: Flo1 (Stratford and Assinder, 1991) NewFlo (Stratford and Assinder, 1991) and Mannose Insensitive (MI).(Masy et al., 1992; Dengis and Rouxhet, 1997) These flocculation phenotypes differ in the time of the onset of flocculation and the sugar inhibition of flocculation. The genetic control of yeast flocculation has not been extensively studied. Recent reports suggest genes encoding lectin-like proteins exhibit close sequence homology.(Jin and Speers, 1991, 1999; Smart, 2001) Furthermore, it seems that FLO genes have interchangeable functions that can compensate for one another.(Guo et al., 2000) =Flocculation phenotypes= The Flo1 phenotype is inhibited by mannose(Burns, 1937; Miki et al., 1982; Nishihara and Toraya, 1987; Kihn et al., 1988; Stratford, 1989; Stratford and Assinder, 1991) occurs in both ale and lager strains.(Miki, 1982; Stratford and Assinder, 1991; Masy et al., 1992; Smit et al., 1982; Stratford, 1993; Stratford and Carter, 1993; Teunissen et al., 1993; Teunissen et al., 1995a, b; Bony et al., 1997; Braley and Chaffin, 1999; Fleming and Pennings, 2001; He et al., 2002; Verstrepen et al., 2003) and is associated with the FLO1 gene (Watari, 1991 Masy et al., 1992; Stratford, 1993; Stratford and Carter, 1993; Teunissen et al., 1993; Teunissen et al., 1995a, b; Bony et al., 1997; Braley and Chaffin, 1999) The NewFlo phenotype differs from that of Flo1 in several ways. Firstly NewFlo flocculation is inhibited by mannose, glucose and maltose.(Stratford and Assinder, 1991; Masy, 1992; Rhymes, 1999) Secondly the NewFlo lectin is putatively encoded by the FLO10 gene.(Guo et al., 2000; Smart, 2001) Studies by the Speers group have indicated little change in zymolectin levels through a fermentation. It is argued that lectin maturation occurs some fourteen hours after the cessation of cell division(Stratford, 1989; Stratford and Assinder, 1991; Masy 1992; D’Hautcourt and Smart, 1999) and is therefore not concomitant with entry into stationary phase, although this is strain dependent.(D’Hautcourt and Smart, 1999; Verstrepen et al., 2003) However the molecular proof of this maturation is near non-existent. The picture is complicated by changes in cell surface hydrophobicity and CO2 driven shear which confounds flocculation measurements often erroneously solely attributed to zymolectin interactions. While flocculation (clumping and settling) occurs at this time, this flocculation occurs as a result of changes in hydrophobicity and a decline in shear due to which is in turn to low CO2 evolution.

It was built about 15 BCE, occupying what had previously been open space in the centre of the Agora. It was a gift to the people of Athens by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a Roman statesman and general. History The two-story auditorium seated around 1,000 spectators and was equipped with a raised stage and marble-paved orchestra. On three sides it was surrounded by a subterranean cryptoporticus with stoae above. The building was decorated externally with Corinthian pilasters. The main entrance for spectators was originally on the south side of the building, with access from the terrace of the Middle Stoa. The north facade only had a small portico to give access to the stage. Unfortunately, the span of the auditorium eventually caused the roof to collapse in around 150 CE. The Odeon was rebuilt as a smaller lecture hall, seating only 500, and a more elaborate facade was added to the north side. Its massive pillars were carved in the form of 'giants' (snake tails) and 'tritons' (fish tails). The Odeon was finally destroyed in 267 CE by the Herulians. A sprawling palace was built on the site in the early 5th century CE with the pillars of the northern facade being used to create a monumental entrance.

Early career Devine began playing football with Springfield FC in Cobh, County Cork, where he was capped at U15 and U16 levels, and thereafter signed for English team Middlesbrough. Devine spent four years at Ayresome Park learning his trade before he briefly moved on to Newcastle United and non-league Northallerton. He returned to Ireland to link up with Cobh Wanderers and subsequently joined League of Ireland First Division club Cobh Ramblers. League of Ireland Premier Division Devine made his Cobh debut in August 1993 as a substitute against Cork City in a League Cup tie. He joined League of Ireland Premier Division club Waterford United in 1998 and immediately impressed, later earning a then club record £30,000 transfer to Cork City. The transfer came as City and manager Derek Mountfield were in need of a keeper following a training ground injury to first choice 'keeper Noel Mooney, and Devine's form saw him retain the goalkeeper's jersey even after Mooney returned to full fitness. Noted for excellent shot stopping and spectacular saves, Devine became the \\"closed door\\" behind City's defence, eventually winning the League of Ireland championship in 2005 with many critics speculating on a senior Ireland call-up. He returned to the Blues in January 2009 . He then signed for Cork City in March 2010. .He left the club later that year.

Arion subfuscus (Draparnaud, 1805) is considered by some authors to be a partial synonym for Arion fuscus. Arion subfuscus (Draparnaud, 1805) and A. fuscus (Müller, 1774) have very similar morphology and have overlapping distributional ranges in northwestern Europe. Arion fuscus is widespread throughout Central, North and East Europe whereas A. subfuscus is restricted to West Europe. (For practical purposes the two are synonyms in Germany and in the Czech Republic.) The two taxa are referred to as the species complex Arion subfuscus/fuscus both members having several evolutionary lineages. They are only separable by alloenzyme analysis and gonad type. Description A 50–70 mm roundback slug. It is brown in colour, ranging from black-brown through olive-brown to orange and bright reddish- orange. Darker lateral bands are present. Dark pigment reaches under the pneumostome from back to front. The foot fringe is pale with thin lines. The sole is uniformly pale/translucent.The tentacles are pale or dark. It does not contract into a bell shape when stimulated. The Dusky Arion differs from other Arion species in its yellow-orange body mucus.

It is an active stratovolcano located to the north of Lake Inawashiro. Mount Bandai, including the Bandai heights, belongs to the Bandai- Asahi National Park. The altitude of the triangulation station “Bandai”, installed in 1904, had been employed as the official altitude of Mount Bandai. However, after the station disappeared due to erosion, it was re-measured in October 2010 and now is 1,816.29m. The name “Mount Bandai” is used to refer to the main peak “Bandai”, along with several other peaks including Akahani at 1,430m and Kushigamine at 1,636m, created during the 1888 eruption of Mount Bandai. Mount Bandai was originally called “Iwahashi-yama” which means “a rock ladder to the sky”. It is now sometimes called “Aizu Fuji” and “Aizu Bandai”. The south foot is called Omotebandai and the north foot is called Urabandai. When seen from Omotebandai, the mountain looks very tidy, but when viewed from Urabandai the mountain shows a wild shape, due to its collapse. It is one of the list of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. In 2007, the mountain was selected as one of the top 100 geographic landmarks in Japan. Additionally, in 2011 the mountain was certified as a geopark of Japan.  Volcanic activity  Typical features of mount Bandai's activity are debris avalanches and sector collapses. We know this because evidence of this has been left in past activities. Mount Bandai has not experienced a lava flow after the eruption of about 10,000 years ago. Sediment surveys have shown us that the history of the volcano can be divided into 6 sections. It is thought that the volcanic activity period was from about 290,000 years ago when there were 2 scoria eruptions, after the activity of Mount Nekoma (from approximately 1.1 million years ago to 350 thousand years ago) somewhere to the west. 1\\\\. It is not clear when the volcanic activities of Mount Bandai started, but it is believed that before about 290,000 years ago it was inactive and only became active after the activities of Nekoma volcano, which lies to the west, from 1.1 million years ago to 350,000 years ago. 2\\\\. Approximately 290,000 years ago, there were two scoria eruptions. 3\\\\. From about 210,000 years to 200,000 years ago there were several scoria and pumice eruptions. 4\\\\. Approximately 165,000 to 145,000 years ago, there were eruptions of volcanic ash and pumice. 5\\\\. From about 80,000 years ago to 65,000 years ago, there were sub-plinian and Vulcanian eruptions of pumice, which broke up the shape of the mountain. 6\\\\. Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, there was continuous activity with pumice eruptions, and sector collapse. Mount Bandai Approximately 90,000 years ago at the time of the Okinajima pyroclastic flow, and 50,000 years ago at the time of the Zunashi pyroclastic flow, the river formally flowing through the Inawashiro basin was dammed, the water level went up, and Lake Inawashiro appeared. Although it is said that the eruption which created four peaks in 1888 (Mount Obandai, Mount Kobandai, Mount Akabane, and Mount Amidagamine) was from a Mount Fuji shaped mountain of over 2000 meters formed in an eruption in 806 (the first year of Daido), there is also historic evidence which shows that there were eruptions at earlier times, which also changed the Mount Fuji shaped mountain. = Eruption of 1888 = Ukiyo-e print by Tankei depicting the Eruption of Mount Bandai, 1888 On July 15, 1888 there was an explosion of water vapour in a Kobandai eruption. It is believed that hot ground water continuously spurting out had weathered the mountain and this caused it to collapse. This caused an avalanche of debris to bury 5 nearby villages on the north foot of the mountain and 477 people were killed. This eruption was the first major disaster for the modern Japanese government which began from the Meiji period. The government launched an enquiry to investigate the eruption and this was implemented by Kiyokage Sekiya and Yasu Kikuchi. The government provided relief and attempted to rebuild the affected villages. Extensive research, including surveys was undertaken into the causes of the eruption and the extent of the damage – this was an unusual measure to take at the time. Detailed pictures were taken of the events. Donations amounting to ¥38,000 were gathered (which equates to around ¥1.5Bn presently) and these supported the relief and restoration effort. The Japanese Red Cross organization was involved in the relief effort after having been formed the previous year (1887) following an eruption and this was its first peacetime involvement in relief. A monument was erected in Goshikinuma to honour those who helped the relief effort. ;The events of the eruption :In the week before the eruption there was rumbling but this was not recognized as a warning for the eruption. The earthquake began at around 7am on the day of the eruption and the eruption began at around 7:45. There were roughly 20 explosions following this. After the explosive eruption, the north side of Kobandai collapsed and sector collapses begun. The river Nagasegawa and its tributaries were blocked and lahars (volcanic mudslides) and debris flows damaged the downstream section of the river. Lake Hibara, Onogawako, Akimotoko and Goshikinuma were formed, all lakes of varied sizes. It was at this time the landscape of Urabandai was formed.  Sacred Mountains  The Enichi Temple, located on the south-western foot of the Bandai Mountain, is surrounded by mountains where people come to worship; Mount Bandai (north east to the temple), Mount Mayadake (north to the temple), and Mount Azuma (north to Mount Bandai). The temple has served a central role in mountain worship because of its location. The Enichi Temple was founded in 807 A.D., one year after Mount Bandai erupted. Some people think that there is a connection between the eruption and the foundation of the Enichi Temple. Several routes for visiting Azumayama Shrine have been established, all originating from the main temple of the Enichi shrine.  Climbing routes  There are 7 climbing routes of Mount Bandai, as follows. * Happoudai mountain entrance route (八方台登山口): (Nekoma-happoudai→ Nakanoyuato → Ohanabatake observatory → Koubou-shimizu → mountain peak, duration: 2 hours, 3.5 km, range 620m) In August 2013, there was a defoliation outbreak caused by a species of moth, or beech caterpillar (Quadricalcarifera punctatella Motschulsky). * Inawashiro mountain entrance route (猪苗代登山口): (Inawashiro Ski Centre → Tennoniwa → Mount Akahani → Numano-daira → Koubou Shimizu → mountain peak, duration: 3.5 hours, 5.5 km, range 1100m) The Ski Resort route contains an additional 3 stops (West piste → Hayama Route → Rinkan Route) * Okinajima Route (翁島登山口): (Inawashiro Ski Resort → mountain peak, duration: 3 hours, 3 km, range 1000m) This route can be shortened by using the gondolas at the Inawashiro Ski Resort to 1 hour, but prior booking is required. There is no source of fresh water on the route. * Urabandai mountain entrance A (裏磐梯登山口A) (Urabandai Ski Centre → Akanuma → Nakanoyu-ato → Koubou Shimizu → mountain peak duration: 3 hours 10 minutes, 6 km, range 900m) During the rainy season and early spring, the Akanuma area becomes waterlogged and due measures are required. * Urabandai mountain entrance B (裏磐梯登山口B) (Urabandai Ski Centre → Kakougen → Kushigamine Col → Koubou Shimizu → mountain peak duration: 3 hours 20 minutes, 6 km, range 900m). The Kakougen route is hard to follow, and around the Kakouheki route, beware of falling rocks. * Kawakami mountain entrance route (川上登山口) (Kawakami mountain entrance → Kakougen → Kushigamine Col → Koubou Shimizu → mountain peak, duration: 4 hours, 7 km, range: 1100m) The Kawakami Spa mountain entrance is out of use, and the route is unclear before joining with that of the Urabandai course. * Shibutani mountain entrance route (渋谷登山口) (Family Snow Park Bandai x2 mountain entrance → Biwasawa route → Numano-daira → Koubou Shimizu → mountain peak, duration: 3 hours 40 minutes, 7 km, range: 1200m). In the summer season, the route is unclear due to the proliferation of grass. Due to its lack of usage, it is referred to as the ‘Forest of Animals’. Over 80% of summer climbers make use of the Happou mountain entrance route, which is located midway through the Bandai Golden Line (toll road). A source of potable water, the Kogane Shimizu, is located partway through the Inawashiro, Urabandai B, Kawakami, and Shibutani routes, and is located 45 minutes from the mountain peak at 1500m above sea level. Another source of potable water, at the Koubou Shimizu, is passable by all routes except the Okinajima route. It is located 30 minutes from the peak, and its altitude is 1630m above sea level. There are 2 shops at Koubou shimizu, which are open from early May to early October, and sell souvenirs, drinks and snacks, but are not accommodations. There are also restrooms, which are rented by the shopkeepers for ¥300. This stop is used also for checking routes and rest. Due to the spillover effect, 1-seg signal for Yamagata-television and major four commercial broadcasting of Niigata prefecture (BSN,NST,TeNY and UX) can be received from the top of the mountain. The gentle slope along West Bantetsu line from near the Okina-jima station to Hirota station was formed by pyroclastic and non-pyroclastic flow of multiple eruptions over past years. The Goshiki-numa was created as a result of volcanic mud flow on Urabandai area from the 1888 eruption, and it carry away the large rock, called Mine-no-Ooishi, to its end of the north sector of the Iwashiro city.

Gaugericus founded churches and abbeys, including a monastery dedicated to St. Medard, to host relics, which contributed powerfully to giving Cambrai both the appearance and functions of a city. Around the year 580, Gaugericus built a chapel on the largest island in the Senne near Brussels. Saint-Géry Island is named after him. When the see of Cambrai-Arras fell vacant around 585, Gaugericus was elected bishop with the consent of Childebert II.Butler, Alban. “Saint Gery, or Gaugericus, Bishop and Confessor”.

He is most famous for his 1957 effort to climb the 1938 route on the north face of the Eiger, during which his party was stranded and a massive rescue operation was organized. Corti was successfully rescued, but his partner, Stefano Longhi, was not. 1957 Eiger attempt and rescue The German team of Gunther Nothdurft and Franz Meyer, who met the Italian team on the face, successfully summited but died on the way down. Corti, who spent over a week on the face, became the centre of a great deal of controversy. He could not produce a coherent story about what happened on the face, and this, coupled with a sensationalistic press campaign and the opinions expressed by Heinrich Harrer in The White Spider, created an atmosphere of deep suspicion around him. However, he was completely cleared when the dead Germans' bodies were found on the opposite side of the mountain. Article \\"Claudio Corti (1928-2010) : A Life in the Shadow of the Eiger\\" The rescue operation itself is known as one of the greatest of all time. The operation crossed international boundaries and included many men. The local Swiss guides got a lot of criticism for not responding. However, it was their policy not to respond to parties trapped on the face because they generally thought it foolish to climb the face and that a rescue would risk the lives of the rescuers.See more details in this extract from this article:Another Side to a Guide's Life by Swiss alpine guide Werner Stäger Jack Olsen investigated the rescue and interviewed Corti in the early 1960s, using his research as the basis for The Climb up to Hell. In 2008 Italian writer Giorgio Spreafico released a book on the 1957 Eiger tragedy, Il prigioniero dell'Eiger (The Eiger Prisoner); the book contains a long interview with Claudio Corti, and a detailed historic reconstruction of the events. Review of Il prigioniero dell'Eiger on montagna.org Other climbing The Eiger controversy in some way overshadowed the rest of Corti's mountaineering career. Corti climbed extensively in the Alps, becoming the first person to open two new routes on Piz Badile, and making early repeats of important routes.

Bacteria serve as natural hosts. Tectiviruses have no head-tail structure, but are capable of producing tail-like tubes of ~ 60×10 nm upon adsorption or after chloroform treatment. The name is derived from Latin tectus (meaning 'covered'). Virology The virions of Tectiviridae species are non- enveloped, icosahedral and display a pseudo T=25 symmetry. The capsid has two layers. The outer layer is a protein structure of 240 capsid proteins trimers, and the inner one is a proteinaceous lipid membrane which envelopes the virus genome. Apical spikes extending about 20 nanometers (nm) protrude from the icosahedrons vertices. The genome is a single molecule of linear double- stranded DNA of 15 kilobases in length, and has 30 open reading frames. It forms a tightly packed coil and encodes several structural proteins. It encodes about 30 proteins that are transcribed in operons. At least 9 structural proteins are present in the viron. The genome is about 66 megaDaltons in weight and constitutes 14–15% of the virion by weight. Lipids constitute a further 15% by weight. Carbohydrates are not present. Life cycle Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by adsorption into the host cell. After adsorption to the host cell surface the virion extrudes a tail-tube structure through a vertex for genome delivery into the host. Replication follows the DNA strand displacement model. DNA- templated transcription is the method of transcription. Capsid proteins polymerize around a lipoprotein vesicle translocated in the cytoplasm by virion assembly factors. Mature virons are released by lysis, which, in the case of PRD1, is achieved with the aid of virus-encoded lysis machinery consisting of four proteins: P15 (endolysin), P35 (holin), P36 and P37 (homologues of the Rz/Rz1 proteins of phage lambda). Taxonomy Tectiviruses have been classified into three major groups: (1) phages that infect Gram- negative bacteria (which lyse the host cell, not forming prophages) (2) those that infect Gram-positive bacteria (forming prophages) and (3) a virus that infects Gluconobacter cerinus. The tectivirus groups have a similar genome size and organization, but they have no detectable sequence similarity at the nucleotide level. Three genera have been identified in this family: Alphatectivirus - infecting Enterobactericeae; Betatectivirus - infecting Gram positive bacteria; and Gammatectivirus.

Allen Orr (born 1960) is the Shirley Cox Kearns Professor of Biology at the University of Rochester.  Education and career  Orr earned his bachelor's degree in Biology and Philosophy from the College of William and Mary and his Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Chicago. At Chicago, Orr studied under Jerry Coyne. He performed postdoctoral research at the University of California, Davis.Orr's CV from his lab page  Work  Orr is an evolutionary geneticist whose research focuses on the genetics of speciation and the genetics of adaptation, in particular on the genetic basis of hybrid sterility and inviability. How many genes cause reproductive isolation between species? What are the normal functions of these genes and what evolutionary forces drove their divergence? He studies these problems through genetic analysis of reproductive isolation between species of Drosophila. In his adaptation work, Orr is interested in theoretical rules or patterns that might characterize the population genetics of adaptation. He studies these patterns using both population genetic theory and experiment. His early work on Drosophila set the terms of much of the current research on speciation.Jerry A. Coyne and H. Allen Orr Evolution, Vol. 43, No. 2 (Mar., 1989), pp. 362-381 Orr is said to be one of the few evolutionary biologists ever to have made fundamental contributions about how changes occur within lineages over time, and about how lineages split to result in new species.U of Rochester announcement = Speciation = His book Speciation,Jerry A.

Blackman and Loren H. Rieseberg Science 305 no. 5684, pp. 612-613 They consider that studying speciation is largely synonymous with studying reproductive isolation, and explore what we know about where, when, and how isolating barriers evolve. Following Ernst Mayr they argue that speciation usually occurs where populations are geographically isolated or allopatric. They present evidence for the primacy of natural and sexual selection over genetic drift in driving speciation. Signatures of positive selection on genes involved in postzygotic isolation and reproductive proteins as well as experimental evidence from both the lab and field connect adaptation and sexual selection to reproductive isolation. They also present evidence for the congruence of the Dobzhansky-Muller model for the evolution of postzygotic isolation with the genetics of hybrid incompatibilities in many natural systems. Results that support their conclusions in the book continue to be publishedsee e.g. D. A. Barbash, D. F. Siino, A. M. Tarone, J. Roote, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although science education focuses almost exclusively on the second task, a good case can be made that the first is both the harder and the more important. Getting Mendel's laws from Mendel's data may not be easy, but surely the hardest part is daring to ask Mendel's question: Despite all appearances to the contrary, might heredity obey simple laws?\\". Orr considers \\"scientism, the view that all truths are ultimately scientific\\" to be naive, hubristic and just plain wrongGould review - the full quote is \\"It may seem obvious that there are mathematical truths (1+1 = 2), logical truths (All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates was mortal), historical truths (Socrates was mortal), folk psychological truths (someone who’s blushing is embarrassed) and socially constructed truths (paper bearing George, but not Grover, Washington’s likeness is worth something). And it may seem equally obvious that none of these is scientific. The world is not all science and there are places where science cannot and even should not go. But this lesson has come surprisingly hard to many philosophers and scientists–for instance, E. O. Wilson. Gould has, all along, been on the right side of this skirmish. Scientism is naive and it is hubristic. But, most of all, it’s just plain wrong.\\" and is generally critical of what he sees as unwarranted attempts to generalise or draw philosophical conclusions from scientific facts. He laments the popular trend whereby \\"some pet theory gets elevated to its rightful place as 'the' way to think about evolution. But this longing to dress up biology in unusual new perspectives has, so far, yielded more book deals than results\\". He is highly critical of William Dembski's 2002 book No Free Lunch suggesting that although the counterintuitive No Free Lunch theorems of computer science do indeed rule out the generation of specified complexity in a specific technical sense, this has nothing to do with Darwinism which is not trying to reach a pre-specified target, and of Michael Behe's 1996 book Darwin's Black Box which he characterises as \\"cleverly argued, biologically informed — and wrong\\". He concedes that there are biological systems which are irreducibly complex in Behe's sense but suggests that \\"An irreducibly complex system can be built gradually by adding parts that, while initially just advantageous, become — because of later changes — essential\\".Orr Cites: H. J. Muller, \\"Reversibility in Evolution Considered from the Standpoint of Genetics,\\" Biological Reviews 14 (1939): 261–80 He also suggests that, while he has \\"utter confidence in Behe's biochemistry\\" Behe \\"is not at home in the technical evolution literature.\\" However he is also critical of Daniel Dennett, Steven Pinker and Richard Dawkins, expressing serious reservations about their arguments and defending these in extended follow-up correspondence.Dennett also objected to Orr's review of The God Delusion which led to an extensive exchange of letters reproduced here Orr is not satisfied by Stephen Jay Gould's NOMA suggestion. Whilst highly critical of claims that physics has \\"found God\\" he points out that \\"many of the [20th] century’s leading scientists – including some of the brightest stars of evolutionary biology...were deeply religious... Theodosius Dobzhansky was a Christian and something of an amateur theologian; Sir Ronald Fisher was a deeply devout Anglican who, between founding modern statistics and population genetics, penned articles for church magazines; and J.B.S. Haldane was an unabashed mystic\\". Moreover, Orr thinks that Gould's redefinition of religion to be solely concerned with moral values is not what anyone who practices the thing means by religion (or almost anyone, anyway), and that it will not do to pretend that all will be well in some imagined world where people of goodwill pursue invariably consonant views. So whereas it may be that the road Gould cuts is in a sensible enough direction (a considerable improvement over the present state in which creationists pester scientists and scientists preach values, and avoiding many of the inanities that often accompany talk of religion by scientists) it is a far bumpier road than Gould lets on.Gould on God Can religion and science be happily reconciled? in the Boston Review  Awards and recognition  Orr has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship, an Alfred P.

The battle was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek’s own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek’s before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek’s objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek’s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek’s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders’ surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Battle On August 24, 1945, the 4th Division of the New Fourth Army attacked the city of Five Rivers (Wu He, 五河) in the eastern Anhui after the local defenders refused to surrender. The former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined nationalist in the after World War II proved to be absolutely no match for the attacking enemy, and the entire garrison consisted of five companies were lost with over 500 being captured alive (including the commander) by the attacking enemy. In addition, the enemy also succeeded in capturing eight light machine guns and over four hundred repeating rifles. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek’s secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists’ loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. The communists did not have the dilemmas faced by the nationalists and enjoyed popular support, and thus was able to easily overwhelm their nationalist adversary, and thus achieving victory without much difficulty, further threatening Bangbu (蚌埠). Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, the political gain was much greater than the military one for the communists as result of this battle.

According to the 2011 UK census, Londesborough parish had a population of 182, a reduction of one on the 2001 UK census figure. The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long distance footpath passes through the village. Some scholars suggest the still- undiscovered Roman camp of Delgovicia is in the vicinity of Londesborough. Londesborough Hall was a country house in the village but all that now remains is the park land that surrounded the house which is called Londesborough Park. The church dedicated to All Saints was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. In 1823 Londesborough was a civil parish in the Holme Beacon Division in the Wapentake of Harthill. Londesborough is one of the sites in the East Riding that have been conjectured as the Romano-British town of Delgovicia, an eastern station associated with York. A Roman road from Brough on the Humber Estuary ran directly north to meet Londesborough estate and village, where were found Roman coins and burial repositories. The estate of Londesborough was one of the seats of the Dukes of Devonshire. It was an historical possession of the Clifford family--Earls of Cumberland--until the 5th Earl's only heiress married the Earl of Cork, from whose family the Dukes of Devonshire are descended. The estate's mansion in 1823 had recently been demolished. The 6th Duke of Devonshire was the patron of All Saints' Church, the ecclesiastical parish living, and a hospital for \\"six old bachelors or widowers, and six widows\\". Londesborough population in 1823 was 244. Within the parish was a blacksmith, a clerk, a schoolmaster who was also the parish clerk, the parish rector, the agent for the Duke of Devonshire, and the landlord of The Devonshire Arms public house who was also a maltster. Londesborough was served by Londesborough railway station on the York to Beverley Line between 1847 and 1965. Notable people * Mark Briggs, a notable Great War conscientious objector in New Zealand was born in Londesborough in 1884. He emigrated to New Zealand with his father and brother, where he became a radical trade unionist and socialist. In 1917, he was forcibly shipped to France where he was subjected to much pain and humiliation from the military to force him to give up his principles. He did not and was eventually returned to New Zealand. He later became a member of New Zealand's Legislative Council, where the former Minister of War, James Allen publicly apologised for his treatment. * Andy Strangeway, the first man to visit and sleep on all Scotland's major islands, was born in Londesborough in 1965.

Additionally, some spawn implementations only allow the user to join games hosted by the installer's cd-key. There are several purposes for a spawn installation, including but not limited to creating added value by allowing the owner of the game to experience the multiplayer mode with friends and demonstrating the game to more potential buyers. A similar concept (for example, in some Command & Conquer games) is the use of multiple game discs. Each disc contains a discrete portion of the game, such as an individual campaign. Sharing a disc with a friend allows both the owner and the friend to experience the full content of each respective disc, but not at the same time. In contrast with spawn installations, the disadvantage to the multiple-disc approach was that the game could only be shared among as many people as there were discs, while spawn installations could be used on any number of systems. This concept is very similar to the single-card-multiplayer \\"Download Play\\" option that some Nintendo DS games offer (such as Super Mario 64 DS). The difference here, however, is that a spawn installation is installed on the system like a normal program, whereas the Nintendo DS only keeps its downloaded copy in memory while it is powered on.

In the second half of 1947, Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping and Li Xiannian decided to reestablish Jianghan (江汉) Military Region by combining the communist 5th Division from southern Shaanxi and the communist force in western Hubei in the Dabie Mountains, and Zhao Jimei (赵基梅) was named as the first commander. On December 14, 1947, under the new commander Zhang Caiqian (张才千), the communist force crossed the Beijing–Hankou railroad to strengthen their positions, and on December 20, 1947, the 1st Regiment of the communist Independent brigade launched its assault on Jingshan. Faced with overwhelming enemy force, the security battalion guarding the city retreated without a fight, but in the haste of retreat, the nationalists failed to destroy abundant provisions stocked in the city, and thus provided the enemy with great resources, which proved to be fatal for the nationalists in the subsequent battles in the region. At 3:00 AM on December 22, 1947, the communists concentrated their forces by gathering three regiments to start their march toward Zhongxiang. The nationalist force was scattered to defend other isolated positions and thus was not able to regroup and reinforce the Zhongxiang, which was defended by a single regiment. After an hour of fierce battle, all of the nationalist positions in the outskirt of the city fell and being cut off by the attack enemy, the surviving defenders of these positions were forced to retreat to other directions instead of back into the city. After witnessing the annihilation of the defenders outside the city wall, the defenders inside the city wall attempted to break out via the south gate, but they were beaten back into the city. At 4:00 PM, the final assault on the city began under the cover of shelling of the nationalist positions from several dozen artillery pieces and fire from over 90 machine guns. The defenders were completely suppressed and the attacking enemy was able to breach the city wall at places of White Tiger Hall (Bai Hu Tang, 白虎堂) and Fuying Hall (Fu Yin Hall, 福音堂). The enemy assault team was able to subsequently breach the defense at the Great East Gate of the city wall, enabling the main force of the attacking enemy to enter the city via the gap. After several hours of brave and desperate but futile street fighting put up by the nationalists, the defenders were completely wiped out by the enemy before dusk. The communists gathered 367 cadavers of the nationalist defenders in the battle to take Zhongxiang. After the battle, the communists abandoned the city on December 25, 1947 according to the plan, and retreated to countryside with abundant provisions captured. The nationalists returned to the empty city on December 29, 1947, but the city was looted clean by the enemy, thus severely limiting the nationalist capabilities for any future operations. In contrary, the communists used the abundant supplies captured to boost their strength and solidify their gains in the rural regions surrounding the city, and it was only a matter of time before they retake the city. The nationalists forced on the defensive were incapable of stopping the enemy and in June, 1948, Zhongxiang fell for the second time, and this time for good, with the nationalists being permanently driven out. The communist victory was rooted in the correct strategy of controlling the rural regions surrounding the cities first, and then taking the cities with isolated enemy garrisons. The nationalists, in contrast, avoided heavy loss in the initial stage by not engaging the overwhelmingly strong enemy, but in doing so, allowed the enemy to loot important provisions in great quantity when they failed to destroy any provisions in retreats. As a result, the numerically superior nationalist force was not able to sustain themselves for any prolonged operations outside the city walls due to insufficient supply, and was thus gradually reduced in numbers in many small but consecutive engagements as the well supplied enemy attacked.

They are type-certificated in the transport category and are used in a wide variety of applications, including crop dusting, cargo lifting and aerial firefighting. Development A Bell XH-40, a prototype of the UH-1 and Bell 204 Bell designed its Model 204 in response to a 1955 United States Army requirement for a utility helicopter. The 204 was a giant step forward in helicopter design, being one of the first to be powered by a turboshaft. The turboshaft engine radically improved the practicality of the helicopter due to its light weight and high power-to-weight ratio, lower fuel consumption, and lower maintenance and operating costs. The use of a turboshaft in the 204 allowed it to carry a useful payload over respectable ranges and at reasonable speeds, which resulted in the 204 and subsequent 205 becoming the most successful western helicopter series in terms of numbers built.Frawley, Gerard: The International Directory of Civil Aircraft, 2003–2004, page 44. Aerospace Publications Pty Ltd, 2003. The civil 204B was first delivered in 1961. The subsequent Model 205A-1 is equivalent to the UH-1H, which, compared to the 204, is longer, larger, and has better performance and a more powerful engine. Over 60 civil Model 204B helicopters had been delivered by 1967, while further examples were built by Agusta-Bell until 1973. 12,000 Model 205s (including civil 205A-1s) were built by Bell and Agusta-Bell up to the early 1980s.

Prelude After the Yuncheng Campaign (运城战役), Linfen was the only nationalist stronghold left in southern Shanxi. Linfen was ideal to defend: the city wall was 15 metre tall and 10 metre wide at the top, 25 – 30 metres wide at the bottom, and at the section of the Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, 东关), there was a second wall of the same size, providing additional protection. There were a total of 31 clusters of bunkers around the city and additional strongholds within 3 – 7 km range in the outskirt. There were deep ditches both outside and inside city wall, and fortifications within the city. Located on the eastern bank of Fen River, the east, north and south directions were wide open, with little cover for the attacking enemy to hide. The nationalist strategy was to hold on until reinforcement arrived and then counterattack, while the communist strategy was to take the city primarily using tunnels since the communists lacked heavy artillery pieces. Order of battle Defenders totaling 25,000: nationalist order of battle: *The 66th Division deployed in positions outside the city *The 30th Brigade *The artillery battalion of the 27th Brigade *Two Security Brigades *Two Training Regiments *Security forces of adjacent 15 counties withdrew into the city of Linfen Attackers totaling 53,000: communist order of battle: *The 8th Column *The 13th Column *Units of the Taiyue (太岳) Military District First stage The nationalists begun to airlift the 30th Brigade to Luochuan (洛川) from Linfen on March 6, 1948 to strengthen the nationalist force in northwestern China. In order to prevent this, the communists decided to launch the campaign early and on March 7, 1948, the communist 24th Brigade of the 8th Column took the airfield south of Linfen after destroying two aircraft, thus cutoff the aerial link of the city. The nationalists were forced to give up the airlift plan and the city was attacked by the enemy from three sides: east, north and south. The nationalist strongholds in the outskirt of Linfen including Cui Family's Bump (Cui Jia Geda, 崔家疙瘩), Train Station (Huoche Zhan, 火车站), High River Hotel (Gao He Dian, 高河店) and Official Yao's Temple (Yao Guan Miao, 尧官庙) fell into the enemy hands, and the nationalist futile attempt to counterattack and retake these strongholds were beaten back for more than thirty times. Afterward, the enemy approached the outer city of Linfen, the Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, 东关), which was the barrier for Linfen, and the nationalists desperately attempted to hold on this critical defensive stronghold. From March 23, 1948 – March 27, 1948, the nationalist defenders twice successfully beaten back the attacks on Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, 东关) by the communist 13th Column. On April 1, 1948, the enemy adjusted tactic and the communist 37th Brigade of the 13th Column attacked from southeast and the communist 23rd Brigade of the 8th Column attacked from northeast simultaneously, while the 4 tunnels were dug toward the city wall. On April 10, 1948, three of the four tunnels were filled with explosives and detonated simultaneously, succeeding in collapsing the city wall of the Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, 东关) section, and attacking communist 37th Brigade of the 13th Column and the communist 23rd Brigade of the 8th Column were able to swiftly taking the Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, 东关), the outer city of Linfen, badly mauling the local defenders, the nationalist 66th Division. Second stage On April 16, 1948, the battle mostly had switched to underground when the communist 8th Column and Taiyue (太岳) Military District at eastern outskirt of Linfen and the 13th Column at southern outskirt of Linfen begun to dig 15 tunnels toward the city wall and an additional 40+ tunnels for cover. Taking the lesson learned from the loss of Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, 东关), the defenders also begun to dig tunnels to counter the underground threat. In addition, under the cover of shelling with incendiary rounds and gas attacks, the nationalist 30th Brigade counterattacked the enemy with air cover. Although the nationalist counterattack was beaten back the enemy, and the nationalists did succeed in destroying most of the enemy tunnels. On May 1, 1948, the Xu Xiangqian changed their tactic by deploying the communist 13th Column to the east of the city to assist the communist 8th Column to attack the city, while the 22nd Brigade of the communist 8th Column and the 39th Brigade of the communist 13th Column were deployed to assist the communist regiment of the Taiyue (太岳) Military District on the western bank of the Fen River to blockade the escape route of the fleeing enemy. On May 16, 1948, the 23rd Brigade of the 8th Column succeeded in extending two 110 metre-long tunnels directly under the city wall, filling one with 6,000 kg black dynamite and the other with 3,500 kg dynamite. On May 15, 1948 at 7:50 PM, the dynamites were detonated, blowing up two 50 metre wide gaps in the city wall and the assault team of the 69th Regiment of the communist 23rd Brigade was the first to ventured into the city and other communist units soon followed under the cover of heavy artillery fire. After fierce street fights, the battle ended after midnight when all of the defenders were either killed or captured, and the campaign concluded. Outcome The entire nationalist garrison of Linfen was lost, including the Commander-in-chief, Liang Peihuang 梁培璜, who was captured alive by the enemy. The fall of Linfen meant that the last nationalist stronghold in southern Shanxi was finally eliminated. The communist victory of Linfen Campaign resulted in the linking up of the Lüliang communist base and Taiyue (太岳) communist base, and the entire southern Shanxi region falling into the communist hands. The communist 23rd Brigade of the 8th Column played a significant role in the taking of Linfen and was honored as Linfen Brigade after the campaign.

Prelude In the mid August 1946, the nationalists planned to redeploy four brigades from Shaanxi to Wing City (Yi Cheng, 翼城) and Linfen in southern Shanxi to push northward along the railroad in coordination with nationalists pushing southward from Pingyao and Jiexiu (介休), thus annihilating the communists in between at the Flooding Hole (Hong Dong, 洪洞) and Zhao's City (Zhao Cheng, 赵城) regions. The communists, in turn, deployed the 24th Brigade of the Taiyue (太岳) Military Region to the north of Lingshi (灵石) to stop the nationalists from the north, while the communist main force was prepared to ambush the nationalists from the south in regions between Linfen and Floating Mountain (Fushan, 浮山). Order of battle The nationalist order of battle: 5 Brigades totaling 11,500: *The Reorganized 30th Division *The 1st Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division *The 167th Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division The communist order of battle: 4 Brigades totaling 8,800: *The 10th Brigade of the 4th Column *The 11th Brigade of the 4th Column *The 13th Brigade of the 4th Column *The 24th Brigade of the Taiyue (太岳) Military Region Campaign On September 22, 1946, the nationalist 167th Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division and the nationalist 27th Brigade of the Reorganized 30th Division took Floating Mountain (Fushan, 浮山), and the nationalist 2nd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division pushed eastward along the road from Floating Mountain (Fushan, 浮山) to Linfen. A portion of the communist 13th Brigade of the 4th Column faked attack on Floating Mountain (Fushan, 浮山), while its main force, along with the communist 11th Brigade of the 4th Column suddenly surrounded the nationalist 2nd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division at the Official Sparrow Village (Guan Que Cun, 官雀村) region between Floating Mountain (Fushan, 浮山) and Linfen. After dark, the enemy launched their assault under the cover of darkness on the besieged nationalists, and the nationalist 2nd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division was subsequently wiped out. Unaware that their besieged comrades-in-arms had already been annihilated by the enemy at the Official Sparrow Village (Guan Que Cun, 官雀村) region, on September 23, 1946, the nationalist 167th Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division and the nationalist 27th Brigade of the Reorganized 30th Division abandoned Floating Mountain (Fushan, 浮山) to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms from the east, while the nationalist 1st Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division attempted to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms from Linfen. The communist 13th Brigade of the 4th Column managed to stop the nationalist reinforcement from the east, while the communist 10th Brigade of the 4th Column besieged the nationalist reinforcement from the west at the Chen's Levee Village (Chen Yan Cun, 陈堰村) region. After the arrival of the main force of the communist 4th Column and the communist 24 Brigade of the Taiyue (太岳) Military Region, the final assault begun at the dusk on September 23, 1946. After a fierce battle that lasted the entire night, the nationalist 1st Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division was completely annihilated by next morning. Hearing the news of the defeat, the nationalist 167th Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division and the nationalist 27th Brigade of the Reorganized 30th Division immediately gave up the fight and retreated to Linfen while the communist 13th Brigade of the 4th Column wisely chose not to pursuit, and the campaign was concluded. Outcome The nationalist defeat cost more than 5,000 casualties, and the original nationalist hope of eliminate the enemy by attacking simultaneously from the north and the south was crashed. However, the political and psychological impact was much more greater than the military defeat: the Nationalist Reorganized 1st Brigade, or nicknamed the \\"1st [Best] Brigade Under the Heaven\\" (天下第一旅), was completely annihilated, with its commander lieutenant general Huang Zhengcheng (黄正诚) captured alive by the communist enemy. After the campaign, the nationalist adopted the correct tactics of not engaging the enemy and hold on the strongholds behind the city walls, but although such tactics reduced loss, it had left vast rural area to the communists.

On 14 August she arrived at Norfolk Navy Yard and reported to Commander, Destroyers, Atlantic Squadron, U.S. Fleet, to overhaul destroyers and serve as flagship. On 1 September she sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving five days later, to prepare and transfer to the British government destroyers involved in the land bases-destroyers exchange. She was visited by the Earl of Athlone, Governor General of Canada, on 8 September. Returning to Norfolk 3 November, she made two similar trips to Halifax in the next month and a half. =World War II= 309x309px During early 1941 Denebola served at Norfolk, tending destroyers and conducting schools in repair work, cruising to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, once and to Bermuda twice. She arrived in Casco Bay, Maine on 12 September to serve as tender to destroyers and other ships there until 5 July 1944. Denebola sailed from Norfolk on 24 July 1944 for duty in the Mediterranean, furnishing tender services at Cagliari, Sardinia, during the invasion of southern France. She continued this duty at Ajaccio, Corsica, and St. Tropez, France, until 23 September when she put into Naples for tender duty until 27 October. She returned to Casco Bay, Maine 1 December. Arriving at Boston 30 April 1945 for repairs, Denebola got underway 13 May for the Pacific, arriving at Eniwetok 30 June. She provided upkeep and repair services to destroyers and other ships until 6 November when she sailed for San Diego, arriving 26 November. She aided in preparing ships for decommissioning until 14 February 1946 when she got underway for San Francisco. Denebola was decommissioned there 10 April 1946 and transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal 1 July 1946. Denebola received one battle star for World War II service.

Common ingredients include onions, garlic, Korean zucchini, carrots, cabbages, squid, mussels, and pork.  History and etymology  Although the dish was inspired by Shandong-style chǎomǎmiàn (), the name of the dish was derived from chanpon, a Japanese Chinese dish derived from Fujian-style mènmiàn (). During the Japanese occupation (1910–1945), the Japanese saw chǎomǎmiàn in Chinese restaurants in Korea and named it chanpon, as the white soup seemed similar to the soup of chanpon to their eyes. The Japanese word was adapted phonetically into Korean as jjamppong. When considering how champon is made, it is assumed that the exported version of chǎomǎmiàn, a type of tó̤ng nṳ̀ sí mīng (湯肉絲麵), would have used boiled pork and chicken bones to make the broth, while the base broth of Jjamppong differ in that it mainly uses stir fried seafood and vegetables with the addition of gochugaru (chili powder) and chili oil; a practice that began in the 1960s.  Variations  In some restaurants, Samsun jjampong (삼선짬뽕) refers to a more expensive option with additional varieties of seafood. Inspired by Gamja-tang, Pork back-bone jjampong (뼈짬뽕) uses a mix of pork bone broth, stir fried seafood, chili oil, and vegetables. Gul jjampong (굴짬뽕) contains oysters and is usually served with a spicy white broth, also called Sacheon Tangmyeon (사천탕면). Gochu jjampong refers to a jjampong with additional spiciness using Cheongyang chili pepper. A panfried variety of jjampong is also served at some restaurants. In jjampong bap (짬뽕밥), rice is used in the place of noodles.

Animals in this genus were one to two centimeters long, with spikes protruding from their armored bodies. The placement of this genus into a specific family is not universally accepted. History of discovery Jean-Bernard Caron and Donald A. Jackson found a specimen in the Burgess Shale and in 2006 referred to it as \\"scleritomorph C\\" without a detailed description. In 2007 Caron and Simon Conway Morris published a description and named the fossil Orthrozanclus reburrus. The genus name means \\"Dawn scythe\\" and derives from Greek, with the species name meaning \\"bristling hair\\" in Latin. The two known specimens of O. elongata were discovered in 2015 and 2016 and formally described the following year. Description Orthrozanclus reburrus was long including its long spines, and had a fairly slim, roughly oval body that tapered towards the rear, was distinctly convex on top but was surrounded by a flatter rim. The underside was soft and unarmored, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates called \\"sclerites\\", which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines on each side of the body. The sclerites and spines were unmineralized, and had internal cavities that appear to have been circular in cross-section. The shell was convex and shaped like a triangle with rounded corners. It had a bulge at the front, a raised rear edge and a ridge along the middle that flared out towards the rear. It also had finely spaced rings that indicate growth by addition of material round the edges, and coarser ridges which may indicate that the animal was metameric, in other words built out of repeated \\"modules\\". The function of the shell at the front is unknown. The animal clearly lived on the sea-floor, and is thought to have had a muscular foot rather like that of a snail. Classification A reconstruction of Wiwaxia Orthrozanclus′ sclerites are very similar to those of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to: one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of Halkieriids, most of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a monophyletic clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. However this draws Orthrozanclus into a complex debate that has gone on since 1990 about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms, and therefore about the entire \\"family tree\\" of the Lophotrochozoa, a \\"super- phylum\\" that is thought to contain modern molluscs, annelids and brachiopods as well as some extinct groups. The main opponent of this view, Nicholas Butterfield, proposes that Wiwaxia is more closely related to annelids while Halkieriids are very close to molluscs. { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" - valign=\\"top\\"    align=\\"right\\"  } Cladograms: Conway Morris and Caron (2007) — Hypothesis 1 (left) and 2 (right). The authors regard Hypothesis 1 as better supported by the evidence, but not robust.  Butterfield's alternative. } Zhao et al. (2017) propose an alternative - that halkieriids (including orthrozanclus and halkieria) are unrelated to Wiwaxia, but are instead related to the camenellan tommotiids and thus belong in the brachiopod stem lineage.

The campaign marked the beginning of the full-scale civil war fought between the communists and the nationalists in the post-World War II era. The communist victory was largely attributed to their ability to surprise the nationalists with movements and avoid battle in locations with overwhelming Nationalist forces. In a sense, the Nationalists did not evenly distribute their forces, which created pocket holes in their encirclement. The Nationalists were also easily distracted by small Communist forces used to draw attention away from their main forces. The communist was able to locate the relatively weaker defended points of the Nationalist defense and break them. Communists also engaged in close-quarters combat in order to limit the power of the Nationalist artillery and air force, making them less effective than they could have been. Prelude The communist base in this region was established in the middle of World War II along the border area of the Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces after the communists had successfully driven Japanese forces from the countryside and remote mountainous regions. After the end of World War II, the returning nationalists were determined to eliminate the communists in the region. After more than 240 offensives with a mobilized force of 300,000, they had successfully blockaded the communist base and divided it into three isolated pieces. The nationalist headquarters at Zhengzhou was tasked with the job to completely eliminate the enemy in the region with the help of the nationalist Wuhan headquarters. In mid-June 1946, Chiang Kai-shek issued a secret order to the Liu Zhi (刘峙), the nationalist Commander-in-chief of Zhengzhou headquarters and Cheng Qian (程潜), and the nationalist Commander-in-chief of Wuhan Headquarters, giving the general direction of the operation by mobilizing the nationalist blockade force to launch a decisive assault on the besieged communists. Since both sides were still officially at peace, the nationalist forces under the command of Wuhan headquarters would be transferred to the command of the Zhengzhou headquarters in order to avoid the blame of the general public. At 2:00 PM on June 20, 1946, Liu Zhi (刘峙) issued the order to every unit of the nationalist force under his command, and the general objective was to mass troops with absolute numerical and technical superiority to concentrate on the communists in the border areas of Henan and Hubei provinces, eliminating the enemy forces after separating them into smaller pockets by attacking them from southern and eastern Henan. The communist force at/near Xinyang, Jingfu (经扶), Huangchuan (潢川) regions, especially those at Xuanhua Hotel (Xuanhua Dian, 宣化店) and Pobo (泼陂) River regions would be the most desirable target. Order of battle The nationalists mobilized roughly 300,000 troops for the planned elimination of the communists and the subsequent occupation of their base. The communists planned to leave over half of their 60,000 strong force in the region to fight the guerrilla war after the other half had withdrawn. =Encirclement force: nationalist order of battle= *Commander-in-chief of Zhengzhou Headquarters: Liu Zhi 刘峙 *Commander-in-chief of Wuhan Headquarters: Cheng Qian 程潜 **The 11th Army **The 48th Army ** The 1st Division **The 3rd Division **The 11th Division **The 15th Division **The 41st Division **The 47th Division **The 48th Division **The 66th Division **The 72nd Division ** The 75th Division **The 90th Division **The 169th Brigade **Local Security Brigades and Regiments =Breakout force: communist order of battle= The communists called their base the Central Plains Military Region with a total force of 60,000, including two columns and three military districts totaling six division-strength brigades: Central Plains Military Region prior to the breakout: * Commander-in-chief: Li Xiannian * Deputy commander-in-chief: Wang Zhen and Wan Shusheng (王树声) * Political commissar: Zheng Weisan (郑位三) * Deputy political commissar: (王首道) * Chief-of-staff: Wang Zhen * Deputy Chief-of- staff: Zhu Zaoguan (朱早观) * Chief of the Political Directorate: Wan Shoudao (王首道) * Deputy Chief of the Political Directorate: Liu Xing (刘型) * First Column: ** Commander-in-chief: Wang Shusheng (王树声) ** Political commissar: Dai Jiying (戴季英) * Second Column: ** Commander-in-chief: Wen Jianwu(文建武) ** Political Commissar: (任质斌) * Jianghan (江汉) Military District: ** Commander-in- chief: Luo Houfu (罗厚福) ** Political Commissar: Wen Minsheng (文敏生) * Eastern Hubei Military District: ** Commander-in-chief: Zhang Tixue (张体学) ** Political Commissar: Nie Hongjun (聂鸿钧) * Henan Military District: ** Commander-in-chief and Political Commissar: Huang Lin (黄 霖) While the negotiation with the nationalists for the legal withdraw continued, preparation was also made for the inevitable, and the communist force was restructured into three groups for the breakout: * Right Route Force: 15,000 troops under the command of Li Xiannian, consisted of: ** The headquarters staff of the original communist base ** The 13th Brigade of the 2nd Column ** The 45th Regiment of the 15th Brigade of the 2nd Column ** The 359th Brigade under the command of Wang Zhen ** The Cadres Brigade * Left Route Force: 10,000 troops under the command of Wang Shusheng (王树声) and Liu Zijiu (刘子久), consisted of: ** Most units of the 1st Column, with the exception of the 1st Brigade. ** The 15th Brigade of the 2nd Column (except the 45th Regiment). * Eastern Route Force: 7,000 troops commanded by the commander Pi Dingjun (皮定钧) and political commissar Xu Zirong (徐子荣). ** The 1st Brigade of the 1st Column * The remaining of units were tasked to cover the main force to break out and then remain in the region afterward to fight guerrilla wars against the enemy, and the majority of the forces of the Jianghan (江汉) Military District would withdraw to the west of the Xiang River (襄河). Strategies =The nationalist strategy= The nationalist commander-in-chief of the operation Liu Zhi 刘峙 made the following plans: The nationalist 41st Division guarding Xuchang, Queshan and Minggang was deployed to Xinyang and Luo Mountain (Luo Shan, 罗山) to take regions included Hill Mountain Gate (Gang Shan Meng, 岗山门), Dragon Town (Long Zhen, 龙镇), Light Mountain (Guang Shan, 光山), and Chen Xing's Hotel (Chen Xing Dian, 陈兴店), and attack northward to Xuanhua Hotel (Xuanhua Dian, 宣化店) region. The nationalist 47th Division guarding the Light Mountain (Guang Shan, 光山) and the Luo Mountain (Luo Shan, 罗山) regions was deployed to the east and west of Light Mountain (Guang Shan, 光山) region in order to occupy regions included Sleeping Dragon Stage (Wo Long Tai, 卧龙台), Fuliu Hotel (Fu Liu Dian, 付流店), and then would attack northeastward toward Pobo (泼陂) River and adjacent regions. The 174th Brigade of the nationalist 48th Division under the command of Wei Lihuang was redeployed to the north and the south of Merchant City (Shang Cheng, 商城) to occupy regions included Fuliu Hotel (Fu Liu Dian, 付流店), Dachong (大冲), Shuangmenlan (双门拦), and then would also attack in the Pobo (泼陂) River direction. The nationalist 72nd Division guarding Huang'an (黄安) and Jingfu (经扶) was redeployed to occupy regions included Wester River (Xi He, 西河), Jingfu (经扶) and Shuangmenlan (双门拦), and most of its units with the exception of the 15th Brigade would attack in the Pobo (泼陂) River direction. The 15th Brigade of the nationalist 72nd Division would attack in the direction of King Yu's City (禹王城) to coordinate its attack with that of the 18th Brigade of the nationalist 11th on Mulan Magnolia Mountains from Huangpi (黄陂). The nationalist 66th Division guarding Xinyang and Garden (Huayua, 花园) regions was deployed to regions included Summer Hotel (Xia Dian, 夏 店), Guo Family's Hotel (Guo Jia Dian, 郭家店), Great New Hotel (Da Xin Dian, 大新店) to attack Xuanhua Hotel (Xuanhua Dian, 宣化店) region. The nationalist 15th guarding Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) and Noon Sun (Wu Yang, 午阳) regions was deployed to Xinyang and Guangshui to occupy Great New Hotel (Da Xin Dian, 大新店) and Three Miles Hotel (San Li Dian, 三里店) regions, and then would attack Xuanhua Hotel (Xuanhua Dian, 宣化店) region. A portion of the nationalist 169th Brigade, the 3rd Division and the 75th Division were taken for support. Liu Zhi 刘峙, the nationalist commander-in-chief of the operation was confident that the first full scale confrontation between Chiang Kai-shek and his communist enemy of the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era would result in a decisive nationalist victory. The deployment of the nationalist force was concentrated in the eastern direction, which appeared to be the most obvious direction that the enemy would be likely to take. =Communist strategy= The communists were initially divided on the withdrawal strategy. On June 2, 1946, the political commissar, Zheng Weisan (郑位三), of the communist force telegraphed Mao Zedong to report the initial strategy, suggesting that the bulk of the force should attempt to enter Wudang Mountains in western Hubei, and when the situation allowed, enter Sichuan. The remaining force would split into two parts with one part remaining in the region to fight a guerrilla war. The other part would strike southwestward, first reaching Hunan because it was easier to cross the Yangtze River in comparison to the Yellow River. On June 14, 1946, Zheng Weisan telegraphed Mao Zedong for a second time for an update, claiming that there were two opinions, and the first one insisted on staying in the region to fight a guerrilla war south of the Yellow River in Hubei, Henan, Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and even to expand south of the Yangtze River when the situation allowed. The second opinion preferred to withdraw to North China Plain because it was simply too difficult to stay in the original region. On July 19, 1946, Yan'an replied by claiming that there were two possibilities: one was that the northern withdraw was successful, and the other that the withdraw was impossible, so that preparation must be made to achieve the first objective whenever possible, and to be safe, plans must be also made to create new communist base if the northward withdraw was not possible. In accordance with the instructions from Yan'an, the local communists made the decision to break out westward with the bulk of the existing force. There were two parts of the plan: the first was to push toward regions via Inner Township County (Nei Xiang, 内乡), Xichuan (淅川) and Jingzi Pass (Jingzi Guang, 荆紫关) via the Funiu guerrilla base, and after the nationalist force guarding Xuchang was forced to redeploy, the communist force would then cross the railroad and rivers to reach the communist base in Taiyue (太岳) region via Lushi (卢氏) and Luoning (洛宁). If unsuccessful, then the communists would fight a guerrilla war from their guerrilla base in the Funiu Mountains and then expand to the Qins, gradually reaching southern Gansu or Shaanxi to link up with the communists in these bases. If unable to achieve this first objective, the communists were also prepared to enter Wudang Mountains by crossing the Xiang (襄) River to create new communist base, and when the situation permitted, enter southern Gansu via Sichuan, but the first objective should be achieved whenever it was possible. The second part of the plan involved leaving at least 10,000 troops behind in central and eastern Hubei to fight a guerrilla war and if the guerrilla warfare was not sustainable, then the communist force remained in central Hubei would break out into the Wudang Mountains, and eastern Hubei would break out to southern Anhui. To carry out the plan, the communist force was divided into three forces along different routes. The communist Right Route Force would attempt to break out in northwestern direction to reach the communist base in the border area of Hubei, Henan and Shaanxi provinces after crossing the Beijing–Hankou railroad between Xinyang and Guangshui. The communist Left Route Force would attempt to break out in a southwestern direction by crossing the same railroad between Garden (Huayua, 花园) and Xinyang, reaching the town of Qiyi (祁仪) south of Tanghe (唐河) county. The Eastern Route force was tasked to fake as the main force and attract the enemy for three days in order to guarantee the rest of the force had crossed the Beijing–Hankou railroad. Afterward, the Eastern Route Force was to go eastward, reaching the communist base in the border area of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The initial stage On June 26, 1946, the full scale Chinese Civil War had formally begun when the nationalists begun their attack on Xuanhua Hotel (Xuanhua Dian, 宣化店) region, the center of the communist base in the North China Plain in four fronts. The nationalist 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division attacked from Xinyang, and the nationalist 47th Division attacked from Light Mountain (Guang Shan, 光山) and Luo Mountain (Luo Shan, 罗山). The nationalist 174th Brigade of the 48th Division attacked from Merchant City (Shang Cheng, 商城), and respectively from Huang'an (黄安) and Jingfu (经扶), the Newly Organized 13th Brigade and the Newly Organized 15th Brigade of the nationalist 72nd Division attacked. The nationalist 15th Division and 66th Division were deployed along the Beijing – Hankou railroad to strengthen the blockade. In the meantime, the communists also begun their planned breakout. The Right Route On June 26, 1946, the communist Right Route force departed from Xuanhua Hotel (Xuanhua Dian, 宣化店) region to secretly group in the regions of Se Harbor (Se Gang, 涩港) and Nine Miles Pass (Jiu Li Guang九里关), south of Xinyang. On the night of June 29, 1946, the communist launched a surprise attack on the nationalist 135th Brigade of the 15th Division at He Family's Hotel (He Jian Dian, 贺 家店) and after losing two companies, the nationalists withdrew. The communists subsequently took Willow Grove (Liu Lin, 柳林) train station and crossed Beijing – Hankou railroad. By July 1, 1946, the communist Right Route Force had reached regions of Spring Hotel (Quankou Dian, 泉口店), Wu Family's Hotel (Wu Jia Dian, 吴家 店), and Jiang Creek Hotel (Jiang Creek Hotel, 浆溪店) north of Ying Mountain (Ying Shan, 应山) regions. On July 3, 1946, the nationalist order the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Division and the 41st Division to the regions of Li Mountain (Li Shan, 厉山), High City (Gao Cheng, 高城), Sky River Mouth (Tian He Kou, 天河口) north of Sui (随) County. However, before the last element of the nationalist trap at Sky River Mouth (Tian He Kou, 天河口) was completed, the enemy had already managed to escape to Deer Head (鹿头) Town northeast of Zaoyang. Undeterred, the nationalist attempted to set up a second encirclement by ordering the 3rd Division stationed at Zaoyang, the 41st Division, and the 15th Division to Cangtai (苍苔) region along with air support, hoping to eliminate the communist forces in a second trap. However, after a forced march of 90 km in a single day, these forces had already passed the town of Cangtai (苍苔), Tang River (Tang He, 唐河) and White River (Bai He, 白河) counties. Thereby escaping the second trap planned by the nationalists, they reached the region of Teacher's Hill (Shi Gang, 师岗) south of Inner Township County (Nei Xiang, 内乡) in southwestern Henan on July 11, 1946. To distract the nationalists, the communists decided to split into two columns. The left column consisted of the 45th Regiment of the 15th Brigade and the 13th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column totaling 7,000 people, and would march toward the region of Nanhua Pound (Nan Hua Tang, 南化塘) via the town of Xichuan (淅川). The right column under the command of Wang Zhen consisted of 359th Brigade and the Cadres Brigade would take the town of Xichuan (淅川) and Jingzi Pass (Jingzi Guang, 荆紫关) in advance for the main force, and then continue to its destinations at Mountain Sun (Shan Yang, 山阳) and Zuoshui (柞水) regions in southern Shaanxi after the left column had passed Nanhua Pound (Nan Hua Tang, 南化塘) region. In the meantime, the nationalists made new plans for setting up a third trap for the communists by deploying the 3rd Division, 15th Division, 41st Division, and the 47th Division in regions south of Nanyang, Henan, Zhenping (镇平), Inner Township County (Nei Xiang, 内乡), regions along the Dan River (Dan Jiang, 丹江), and regions to the north and to the east of Xichuan (淅川) and Deng (邓) County. The 61st Brigade of the nationalist 90th stationed at Shan (陕) County and the 1st Brigade of the nationalist 1st stationed at Guanzhong were deployed to Jingzi Pass (Jingzi Guang, 荆紫关), the chokepoint of the traffic linking Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces to complete the trap, and the nationalist plan was to eliminate the enemy on the eastern bank of the Dan River (Dan Jiang, 丹江). The communists in turn, were determined to avoid this fate by crossing the Dan River (Dan Jiang, 丹江) and continue westward, eventually entering Shaanxi. =The Right Column= The nationalist force consisted of the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division, the 125th Brigade of the 47th Division, and the Western Nanyang Security Regiment. It had managed to control all of the crossing points along the Dan River, including Xichuan (淅川), Stirrup Shop (Madeng Pu, 马蹬辅) and Official Li's Bridge (Li Guan Qiao, 李官桥). On July 13, 1946, the communist 359th Brigade launched its offensive to take these crossing points in heavy rains by besieging Xichuan (淅川) as the communist 13th Brigade besieged Stirrup Shop (Madeng Pu, 马蹬辅), while the rest of the communist force fought off the nationalists in pursuit. The local nationalist defenders fell to the tenacious and determined communist attackers, and after a few brief battles the nationalist forces were annihilated. On July 14, 1946, the entire communist Left Route Force successfully crossed the Dan River (Dan Jiang, 丹江) despite constant nationalist aerial attacks. This maneuver dashed the nationalist hope of eliminating the enemy on the eastern bank of the Dan River (Dan Jiang, 丹江) in the third trap. On July 15, 1946, when the communist 359th Brigade had reached Jingzi Pass (Jingzi Guang, 荆紫关), the nationalists in pursuit caught up with the communists. It was obvious that the communists were unable to take the Jingzi Pass (Jingzi Guang, 荆紫关) which was guarded by an overwhelming nationalist force and the communist 359th Brigade was in danger of being wiped out. Wang Zhen, the communist commander decided to turn south and cross the Dan River (Dan Jiang, 丹江) again, and then marched southwestward into the mountains. Wang Zhen's action was completely unexpected by the nationalists, and so forced the nationalists to redeploy their troops in an attempt to trap Wang Zhen's forces. With this move, valuable time was lost and this provided the communists the break they needed. As the nationalists scrambled their forces to follow Wang Zhen's communist force southwestward, Wang Zhen unexpectedly turned again toward Abalone Ridge (Baoyu Ling, 鲍鱼岭), south of Jingzi Pass (Jingzi Guang, 荆紫关). They defeated the nationalist 1st Brigade of the 1st Division that attempted to stop them in the region between Abalone Ridge (Baoyu Ling, 鲍鱼岭) and Nanhua Pound (Nan Hua Tang, 南化塘), and successfully entered the Jade Emperor Mountain (Yuhuang Shan, 玉皇山). The communist intention was clear by then: entering southern Shaanxi as they had originally planned, but via a different route unexpected by their nationalist adversary. As the nationalist gathered all available forces to attack the communist right column, it was obvious that the nationalists had run out time and troops, because due to the completely unexpected communist moves, the nationalists simply could not gather enough strength to stop the enemy. After a fierce battle that lasted two days and a night, the communist right column successfully defeated the nationalists attempted to stop them and eventually managed to reach their planned destinations, the Mountain Sun (Shan Yang, 山阳) and Zuoshui (柞水) regions in southern Shaanxi. Although the nationalist force was in hot pursuit, it was only a matter of time before the communist right column reached safety. It did so by the end of August 1946 by reaching the communist base in Shaanxi, with no major nationalist forces in their way any longer. Wang Zhen's 359th Brigade suffered the heaviest communist casualties in the campaign: 2,917 were lost, and only 1,983 remained when the surviving forces reached Shaanxi, where their number were boosted when 3,000 troops had to be sent to the brigade to make up the loss. =The Left Column= On July 17, 1946, the communist left column reached the Nanhua Pound (Nan Hua Tang, 南化塘) region after the right column. By this time, the nationalist 1st Brigade of the 1st Division previously defeated by the communist right column had regrouped and blocked the path of the communist right column. Although the communist right column managed to attract the enemy to itself and away from the communist left column, this also meant that the communist Right Route had been cut into two sections. With two nationalist divisions in pursuit, the nationalists had hoped to wipe out the communist left column in the valley of Nanhua Pound (Nan Hua Tang, 南化塘). The situation was apparent to both sides and Li Xiannian made plans to open the path to Shaanxi for the communists by defeating the nationalist 1st Division first. The 37th Regiment of the communist 13th Brigade was to attack the enemy while the 39th Regiment was to outflank the enemy from the left, while the 38th Regiment was to provide cover at the right flank of the 37th Regiment. After a fierce battle that lasted the entire night, the nationalist 1st Division was once again beaten by the enemy before the other two nationalist divisions could catch up and participate in the fight, and the communists successfully continued their westward march afterward. On July 20, 1946, when the communist left column reached the region of Zhao Family's River (Zhao Jia Chuan, 赵家川), the nationalist 3rd Division was the only thing stop them from reaching their goal. With other nationalist units far away from the region, the nationalists were well aware that the communist forces were unstoppable, despite holding advantaged positions in a favorable terrain. After sixteen hours of fierce battle with no reinforcement and victory in sight, the nationalist 3rd Division made a hasty retreat despite only suffering over a thousand casualties, leaving over 400 fallen comrades behind. With its path cleared, the communist left column reached its destination of Shangnan (商南) county in southern Shaanxi on July 29, 1946, successfully evaded the nationalist encirclement, and by August 3, 1946, the communist left column of the Right Route force had successfully established a new communist guerrilla base in the border region of Shaanxi, Hubei and Henan provinces. Left Route On June 25, 1946, the communist Left Route force left the Pobo (泼陂) River and White Sparrow Garden (Baique Yuan, 白雀园) regions of Light Mountain (Guangshan, 光山) counties to march in southwestern direction. However, once reached Yangping Pass (Yangping Kou, 阳平口) to the west of the Gift Mountain (Li Shan, 礼山), their path was blocked by the nationalist 554th Regiment of the 185th Brigade of the 66th Division, the communists thus turned westward instead, begun their crossing of the Beijing – Hankou railroad at the section between Wang's Family's Hotel (Wang Jia Dian, 王家店) and Wei's Family's Hotel (Wei Jia Dian, 魏家店). While fighting off the 6th Brigade of the nationalist 75th Division and the bulk of the 185th Brigade of the nationalist 66th Division that attempted to stop them, the nationalist 11th Division at Xiaogan sent out its 18th Brigade to reinforce their nationalist comrades-in- arms with armor and air supports on June 30, 1946. However, the technical superiority was successfully negated by the enemy by fighting in close quarters at night, and before the dawn of July 1, 1946, the entire enemy force had successfully crossed the Beijing – Hankou railroad, reaching Anlu (安陆) and Ying Mountain (Ying Shan, 应山) regions. The communists of the Left Route had not escaped danger yet, and they still had to cross the Xiang (襄) River southeast of Xuan City (Xuan Cheng, 宣城). Once the communist Left Route force reached the crossing points at Yakou (垭口) and Flowing Water Ditch (Liu Shui Gou, 流水沟) on July 11, 1946, they discovered that local communist force of the Jianghan (江汉) Military District had already crossed the river and the nationalists had destroyed most of the ships. The communists managed to found seven ships and begun the crossing immediately, and the 7th Regiment and the 9th Regiment of the communist 3rd Brigade successfully crossed the river at Yakou (垭口) crossing point. The 4th Regiment of the communist 2nd Brigade at Flowing Water Ditch (Liu Shui Gou, 流水沟) crossing point was in the process of crossing when the nationalist 16th Brigade of the 75th Division reached the crossing point, but under the cover of the 8th Regiment of the communist 3rd Brigade on the eastern bank, the 4th Regiment of the communist 2nd Brigade was able to complete the crossing. The remaining communists on the eastern bank, however, were cut off by the dawn of July 11, 1946. However, such setback turned out to be a blessing for the communists who were cut off on the eastern bank of Xiang (襄) River, because the nationalists were putting emphasis on the communist main force that had already crossed, and thus did not deploy enough troops to stop those communists remained on the eastern bank of the Xiang (襄) River. The communist units that were cut off on the eastern bank of Xiang (襄) River included the 8th Regiment of the communist 3rd Brigade and the 6th Regiment of the communist 2nd Brigade, and portions of the Garrison Regiment and the 15th Brigade totaling 3,500. Under the command of the deputy brigade commander of the communist 3rd Brigade, Min Xuesheng (闵学胜), this group of communists turned north, passing Zaoyang, Xinye, and Tanghe (唐河) county to reach the alternative destination, the communist guerrilla bases in the Funiu Mountains, thus achieving successful breakout before the main force. The main communist force of the Left Route Force consisted of units that had successfully crossed the Xiang (襄) River and was not too far behind either in that they only face one more obstacle, the last nationalist defense line manned by the 185th Brigade of the nationalist 66th Division and the 64th Brigade of the nationalist 15th Division. With the earlier failures of stopping the enemy by the nationalist units with much superior strength and the reinforcement nowhere in sight, nationalists manning the last defensive line were well aware that the enemy was unstoppable. After suffering a thousand or so casualties, the nationalists had had enough and the nationalist commanders decided to save the surviving troops instead of wasting lives on the futile attempts to stop the enemy. On July 21, 1946, the nationalists abandoned their last defensive line in a hasty retreat that left over 300 cadavers of their fallen comrades-in-arms, and thus allowing the communist Left Route force to successfully escape the encirclement. After another failed nationalist attempt to eliminate the enemy which resulted in the successful link-up between the communist Left Route force and the communist units of Jianghan (江汉) Military District in Wudang Mountains, the communist Left Route force successfully established a new base: the Northwestern Hubei Guerrilla Base by August 27, 1946. Eastern route In accordance with the original plan, the communist 1st Brigade of the 1st Column faked itself as the communist main force at White Sparrow Garden (Baique Yuan, 白雀园) region southeast of Light Mountain (Guang Shan, 光山) County. At the dawn of June 26, 1946, the 174th Brigade and an independent regiment of the nationalist 48th Division attacked the region with help of the nationalist 47th Division from both the north and the south sides. After fierce fighting, the communist 1st Brigade of the 1st Column penetrated deep behind the nationalist line from Liujiachong (刘家冲) on June 28, 1946, thus creating the false impression that the main communist force was attempting to break out in the south. Immediately afterward, the communist 1st Brigade of the 1st Column turned eastward, reaching Little Border Ridge (Xiao Jie Ling, 小界岭), the chokepoint of the link between the Hubei and Henan provinces, after successfully breaching the first nationalist blockade line and beaten back the Newly Organized 13th Brigade of the nationalist 72nd Division, hence completed its mission of attracting the enemy to itself and thus providing the opportunity for the communist main force to cross the railroad. By July 1, 1946, the communist 1st Brigade of the 1st Column had reached another chokepoint of the link in between the Hubei and Henan provinces in Merchant City (Shang Cheng, 商城) county, the 1,900-metre- high mountain pass named Pine Seed Pass (Song Zi Guan, 松子关), which was guarded by local nationalist security regiments from the Merchant City (Shang Cheng, 商城) and the Gold Camp (Jin Zhai, 金寨) counties. However, the local defenders proved to be no match for the attacking enemy, and after the mountain peak to the right of the mountain pass fell into the enemy hands, the defense collapsed and the enemy was able to pass under heavy rain and without any replenishment. By July 3, 1946, the communist 1st Brigade of the 1st Column reached the region of Wu's Family's Hotel (Wu Jian Dian, 吴 家店) in the center of Dabie Mountains, but when the communists reached the Green Wind Ridge (Qingfeng Ling, 青风岭), the nationalist 48th Division had already occupied the peak, thus blocking the way, and in the meantime, the nationalists were also closing in from behind. The communists deployed their 1st Regiment to attract the attention of the nationalist 48th Division while the 2nd Regiment outflanked the defenders from the right and attacked from the rear, successfully taking the peak and dispersed the defenders. With the favorable landscape, it was the nationalists turn to be blockaded and there was nothing the pursuing nationalist force could do to stop the enemy. The victory of the Green Wind Ridge enabled the communists to control the high ground directly opposite to the Mozi Deep Pool (Mozi Tan, 磨子潭) region on the western bank of Pi (淠) River, and under the heavy fire from the enemy on the higher ground on the eastern bank, the defenders of the crossing point on the western bank had no choice but to withdraw, thus enabling the enemy to safely across Pi River, and thus successfully escaped the nationalist encirclement. The communist 1st Brigade of the 1st Column subsequently crushed the 138th Division of the nationalist 48th Army in its futile attempt to stop the communists in the region between Lu'an (六安) and Hefei, and successfully reached the communist base in the border area of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces with the remaining 5,000 troops before the rest units of the nationalist 48th Army could have a chance to catch up with the enemy. After twenty-three battles in twenty-four days and traveling more than 500 km, the communist Eastern Route Force became the first among the three to successfully break out. Outcome Although the communist success appeared to be nothing short of a miracle, in reality, nothing could be further from the truth because the nationalist attempt to eliminate the communist in the North China Plain was doomed to fail from the very beginning due to various blunders Chiang Kai-shek had made, and one of the first was that the failure to realize the political fallout of the militarily sensible action. The nationalists had made a military sensible decision in attacking the enemy in the region when it was the weakest, and successfully broken up the enemy base into three isolated parts. However, the timing was extremely poor because the 240+ assaults on the enemy base came shortly after the truce agreement was reached between the nationalists and the communists, and the full-scale civil war had not broken out yet. In contrast, the enemy with absolutely technical and numerical disadvantage, dared not to provoke the nationalists, and instead, wisely chose to give up the communist base and requested to legally withdraw under the nationalist government's permission. The nationalist regime of course rejected the communist request, since it was on the verge of wiping out the enemy in the region, or at least so they thought, but in doing so, the nationalists had further alienated themselves from the general populace, which was already sympathetic toward the communists in the region due to the nationalist breach of the truce when they attacked the numerically and technically inferior local communists who wisely chose to avoid any provocation of its own. The sentiment was still widely held by the general civilian population, especially in the local regions when the full scale Chinese Civil War had broken out, and the military sensible alternative had put the nationalists in a dilemma because of the political fallout due to the nationalists military actions before the breakout of the full-scale civil war. If the bad timing of the nationalist assaults on the much weaker enemy had alienated the civilian populace, especially in the regions where this campaign was fought, the location the nationalists chose certainly turned the alienations into resentment against the nationalist regime. This communist base in the North China Plain bordering the Henan- Anhui-Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi provinces was established in the latter stages of World War II, after the communists had successfully driven the Japanese from the countryside. The local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, and supported the only Chinese force left in the region, the communists who had successfully establishing bases mostly in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, and instead of attacking the enemy in regions where at least there were some forms of the nationalists presence during World War II so that there were some legitimacy and popular support, the nationalist assaults on this regions with absolutely no nationalist presence during the war not only caused them the popular support, but also turned the local popular opinion against the nationalists. Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters were well aware of these two political fallouts but nonetheless took the risk by launching their offensives as planned. The nationalist sympathizers argued that despite the dilemma, Chiang had to proceed due to the immediate military feasibilities, because if the actions were delayed any longer, the situation might turn for the worse (and this was quite possible in reality) for the nationalists and thus making it much for difficult to eradicate the enemy had the nationalists waited, a chance Chiang simply could not afford to take at the time, and this valid argument was even agreed by the enemy they were fighting. Unfortunately for Chiang Kai-shek (and thus fortunately for his communist enemy), the nationalist gamble did not pay off. The biggest blunder committed by the nationalists, however, was the deployment of troops due to Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be a fatal mistake. In accordance with Chiang's attempt, a significant portion of the nationalist troops deployed in this campaign were those belonged to warlords from Guangxi and Hunan. This created two serious consequences that caused the nationalist the possible victory, and the first had to do with the earlier history of the warlord era in China. During the warlord era before World War II, the region was ravaged by the continuous fighting among the warlords of various provinces, and warlords from Guangxi and Hunan caused most damages, and was thus mostly hated by the local populace. Of course, none of the warlords had ever specifically targeted the local regions for destruction, but due to the strategic location of the area, it was destined to become the battlefield whenever the warlords were embroiled in fights for more turfs. Instead of deploying his own troops which would certainly rally more support for the nationalists, Chiang Kai-shek deployed the troops belonged to the most hated warlord cliques by the local population, Guangxi and Hunan, and allowed these warlords to dominate the region after the campaign. As a result, when the two previous nationalist blunders on the time of the offensive and the location of the offensive had turned the local populace from alienation to resentment, this third blunder had certainly turned the local population against the nationalists by driven their support firmly to the enemy side, and not only this contributed to the nationalist failure of this campaign, but it also paved the way for another nationalist defeat in the Campaign of Marching into the Dabie Mountains when enemy returned to the region a year later. The deployment of the warlords' troops also serious hindered the nationalist attempt to eradicate the enemy in that the warlords' objectives were completely different from that of Chiang Kai- shek. In contrast to Chiang Kai-shek's objective of exterminating the enemy within the region, the warlords' objective was purely eradication instead of extermination. Due to the worry (with justification) of Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, the warlords were well aware that their own forces will be significantly reduced if they were really to fight the enemy and once the enemy were exterminated as Chiang Kai-shek had hoped, their forces would be sent elsewhere in China to fight the communists. Consequently, their power and turfs would significantly reduced or even lost completely as the military strength was diminished. On the other hand, if the enemy were allowed to escape unharmed, they would create problem for Chiang Kai-shek in other part of the China and thus Chiang would not have the resource to confront the warlords. Furthermore, as the enemy was allowed to escape unscratched in the region, Chiang Kai-shek's own troops would be forced to bear the brunt of the fighting while the warlords would consolide the power in the newly gained territories. As a result, just like in the Long March, the warlords' had never put any real effort to fight the enemy and the majority of the nationalist casualties in this campaign were among Chiang Kai-shek's own troops. Again, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers were well aware the drawbacks of deploying warlords' troops but went on with the plan anyway, but Chiang Kai-shek did it for a reason, and in fact, a rather very good reason. As Chiang's sympathizers had accurately pointed out (and again agreed by Chiang's communist adversaries), it was already extremely difficult to convince the warlords to deploy their troops outside their own turfs into this region, and any further attempts to deploy their forces further away to exchange for Chiang's own troops being sent to this region would be impossible. As demonstrated later during the Chinese Civil War, the warlords would often simply refuse to take the commands or send their own troops during the campaigns and battles just to keep their own strength. The last blunder the nationalists made was their infatuation with holding on to as much land as possible, which resulted in insufficient force to complete the planned mission. Although more than 300,000 nationalist troops were mobilized in this campaign, around two-thirds of them were deployed to guard the newly conquered land. As the enemy left more than half of its original strength in the region to fight the guerrilla warfare, these troops were tied down, because it was difficult to exterminate the elusive enemy and safeguard the territory at the same time when a static defense posture was adopted in order to hold on to the land. In the meantime, the remaining mobile strike force was insufficient to exterminate the main force of the enemy attempting to breakout, thus neither the extermination of the enemy nor the long-term safeguard of the newly conquered territory could be effectively achieved. Although the nationalist failed to eliminate the enemy, they did succeeded in eradicating the enemy and temporarily taking the enemy base in the region, though this success was negated by the political fallouts such as failing to achieve its original objective of exterminating the enemy within the region in this first campaign of the full scale Chinese Civil War after World War II. The communists, in contrast, did not have the dilemmas of the nationalists and benefited greatly from the nationalist blunders, and thus successfully escaped the nationalist encirclement. In carrying out their plans for the breakout, the communists successfully escaped in the directions where the nationalists totally unexpected and thus achieving surprise, and once the nationalists had realized what was happening, it was too late to redeploy their troops to make up for their misjudgements. Proportionally, the communist had suffered much greater loss because although the number of casualties are the same of both sides, the nationalists had five times more troops than the communists. However, this setback for the communists was minor in comparison to the strategic success of the breakout, and along with the Dingtao Campaign and the Central Jiangsu Campaign, this campaign was one of these three critical ones that helped to stabilize the southern front for the communists in the initial stage of the Chinese Civil War.

Sir Monier Monier-Williams started the Institute in the University of Oxford in 1883 to provide training for the Indian Civil Service of the British Raj. History and building Corner cupola with elephant weathervane In June 1881, plans were submitted to the University of Oxford's Hebdomadal Council to build an Indian Institute. The original site was occupied by four old buildings. The building was designed by Basil Champneys and the first section opened in 1884. Originally there was a low shop to the south, but neighbouring Hertford College has now encroached on the Institute with a much taller building. The Institute was built of Taynton stone in the style of the English Renaissance, with different oriental details to the designs of Champneys. In 1974 Nikolaus Pevsner observed that the rounded corner cupola made an excellent point de vue at the east end of Broad Street. Along with the library (see below), the institute contained lecture rooms and a museum. Some contents of the museum are now present in the Ashmolean and Pitt Rivers Museums. The original Indian Institute building is now the Oxford Martin School of the University of Oxford, the History Faculty having moved to the old City of Oxford School building on George Street and its library to the Bodleian site. Indian Institute Library The Indian Institute Library opened in 1886. It became a dependent library of the Bodleian Library, the main library of the University, in 1927. It specialises in the history and culture of South Asia, especially the Himalayas and Tibet.Bodleian Library: Department of Oriental Collections: 'Indian Institute Library', http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/oriental/iil.htm, accessed 2007-02-14. The library was formerly located in the Indian Institute building, but was moved to the top floor of the New Bodleian Library. Indian Institute Museum The Museum was an integral part of Monier-Williams’ design, modelled to some extent on the India Museum in South Kensington. Monier- Williams acquired some pieces during his fund-raising and collecting tour of India in 1883–1884, including from the International Exhibition, at Calcutta, and arranged for regional representatives to send objects to Oxford. Babu T. N. Mukharji was commissioned to catalogue the collections in 1886 (but he never finished doing so). The installation of the museum was done by Dr Heinrich Lüders, assisted by Mr. Long of the Pitt Rivers Museum, and completed in 1898. When Monier-Williams died in 1899, no financial provision had been made for running the museum. Gradually, the collections were dispersed: entomological and zoological collections to the University Museum; and many pieces to the Pitt Rivers Museum and the Ashmolean Museum. A summary catalogue of the museum was prepared by Mr. A. Rost (for a short handbook to the Institute, by Professor Arthur Macdonell, 1922, but never published).Andrew Topsfield, History of the Indian Collections in Indian Art in the Ashmolean Museum: A catalogue of the Ashmolean’s collection of Indian art; by J. C. Harle & Andrew Topsfield (published Oxford, 1987) Accusations of racism The building was financed entirely by private donors in India and Britain, for the sole purpose of constructing an edifice to house study for and on the Indian sub-continent. There was consequently great controversy in 1968, when the University's governing council evicted the Indian Institute from the premises without compensation, and then made a gift of the premises to the History Faculty, which specialises in European history to the exclusion of Indian history. The government of India filed a formal protest on behalf of the families of the original donors, who felt defrauded by the University's actions. The Oxford University Student Union went further still, accusing the University administration of racism in the decision. The Institute's aim The aim of the Indian Institute was: :The work of fostering and facilitating Indian studies in the University; the work of making Englishmen, and even Indians themselves, appreciate better than they have done before the languages, literature and industries of India.

The film follows a vigilante named Mux (Stahlberg), who lives in Berlin and used to study philosophy. Plot summary Mux's main motivation is an intense desire to bring justice to rapists, thieves, and vandals in his own way, documenting all his actions through a camcorder held by his colleague Gerd, a somewhat simple-minded former long-term unemployed man in his fifties. Through his accidental involvement in a domestic murder case, he eventually attracts a great deal of media attention, allowing him to expand his operation to a nation-wide affair and effectively becoming a crime-fighting entrepreneur. However, his inability to cope with the flawed nature of the human condition proves to be his downfall, as he shoots his girlfriend Kira after discovering that she cheated on him. After a failed suicide attempt and a hasty burial, Mux hands ownership of his company off to an employee and flees to Italy, taking Gerd with him, as he is a witness to his murder of Kira. Mux dies soon after, getting run over while stepping in the way of a speeding car.

The American Academy Larnaca is a non- profit private school in Larnaca, Cyprus offering pre-school to University entrance education. It is a selective, co-educational, independent school, registered under the Private Schools’ Law, 1971, of the Republic of Cyprus. The school was founded in 1908. The school motto is \\"to grow and to serve\\". It is an extension of the culture and/or ethos of the school referred to as \\"the Academy spirit\\" which is characterised by a democratic and positive climate, respect for each other, understanding and co-operation between students and staff as well as student and staff involvement in humanitarian, social, cultural and other activities for the welfare of the people and the community. The school was always a multi-communal school with student enrolment and faculty from Greek Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot, Maronite, Armenian and Latin communities along with foreign nationals. It organises a special event every year co-operating with DOE in which the students has to go through Cyprus' mountains. The school celebrated its centenary in 2008 with a new negative energy building (a first of its kind on the island) and a series of special events.  History  In 1908, two visionaries began planning what would become the American Academy Larnaca. The American Academy Larnaca is one of the nine oldest schools in Cyprus. It was founded in 1908 by two missionaries of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, Rev. McCarroll and Mrs McCarroll, who had originally arrived on the island in charge of an elementary mission school. The McCarrolls secured permission to open a secondary school for boys and thus the American Academy Larnaca was founded. Within a year the school had 60 students enrolled. The purpose of the Academy was to provide a Christian education, which encompassed not only academic training, but also a focus on a Christian way of living. Students graduating from the Academy were taught to be tolerant, respectful and to serve the community whilst upholding high ideals and morals. Similar values underpin our ethos today, with a strong focus on character building and conduct, embodied in our school motto \\"To Grow and To Serve\\". Although the Academy was originally intended as a boys’ school, a girls’ department was opened in 1916 using the mission chapel. The initial experiment was short-lived and the girls’ department closed in 1919 but re- opened ten years later. The boy's section continued to grow as did the number of buildings on the present site. During the Second World War, the school was temporarily transferred to the village of Pano Lefkara where it was housed in various buildings between 1941 and 1943. The present school began to take shape in 1954 with the completion of the Weir Hall, with the auditorium added four years later. The original Memorial Hall was pulled down and the New Memorial Hall began to take shape from 1983 onwards. In 1975 the control of the School, and all its facilities, was handed over to the American Academy Alumni Foundation, since which time it has been run as a non-profit making organisation with charitable status by its own graduates. Governance is undertaken by 11 elected members and two representatives of the original mission church. More about the school's history  Events  Every year, the school's year 6's students plan events in order to collect money for the school's remarkable trip to Greece! This custom has been known to take place in the American Academy for more than 30 years! Classix was 2016's year group to plan events and collect money for the trip, followed by VIkings in 2017.

Life and career Before becoming a sculptor, Francisque Duret had shown interest in pursuing a career in theater. He studied for a brief time at the Conservatoire and his friend Charles Blanc (1813-1882), in an article which he dedicated in 1866, attested to the quality of observing human behavior which Duret had acquired outside his studies of drama: \\"His continual studies of the pantomime led him to pin down the language of gesture and the meaning of each disposition\\". Finally, it was the work of the sculptor which he decided to pursue. After his tutelage under his father, who passed when Duret was but twelve years old, he also studied under Bosio, and won the Prix de Rome in 1823, which he shared with Augustin Dumont for the bas-relief Evandre sur le corps de son fils Pallas. He remained in Italy until 1928. Upon his return to Paris, he received numerous official commissions which assured him of his prestige alongside his work as professor at l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where he had among his students Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Jules Dalou as well as Louis- Léon Cugnot.The romantics to Rodin : French nineteenth-century sculpture from north American collections, Los Angeles : County Museum of Art ; New York : G. Braziller, cop. 1980. In 1833 he exhibited his Neapolitan Fisher Dancing the Tarantella, now in the Louvre, a spirited statue in bronze, which established his reputation. In the same class is his Neapolitan Improvisatore (1839, Leipzig Museum). His works executed for public buildings include: France Protecting her Children (1855), a group in the grand style for the Louvre; two bronze caryatids for the tomb of Napoleon in the Invalides; a colossal Christ in the church of the Madeleine; the statues of Comedy and Tragedy for the Théâtre Français; marble statues of Dunois, Philippe of France, Chateaubriand, and Richelieu at Versailles; and the group for the Fontaine Saint-Michel, representing that saint wrestling with Satan. One of his works, Grape-picker Extemporizing, made in 1839, shows a man playing a mandolin. The sculpture shows the instrument in the period when its popularity had declined outside of Italy. The instrument had left the concert halls, becoming a folk instrument. He received the medal of honor in 1855, was an Officer in the Legion of Honor, and was made a member of the Institut de France in 1845.

He was the Chief Education Officer for Cambridgeshire for over thirty years, taking up the post in 1922 during a time of depression in the United Kingdom following the First World War. Early life Morris was born in Southport in Lancashire in 1889. At the age of fourteen he began work as an office boy at The Southport Visiter, later becoming a reporter. In 1910 he moved to St David's University College, Lampeter to read for a degree in theology, and in 1912 moved to Exeter College, Oxford. At the outbreak of the First World War he volunteered for army service, and became an officer in the RASC. In 1919 following the end of the war he read philosophy at King's College, Cambridge. Career After a year as Assistant Secretary, Henry Morris took up the post of Secretary of Education for Cambridgeshire in 1922. At one point during the Great Depression, Cambridgeshire was the second poorest county in England, despite the relative wealth of the university. Education outside of the City of Cambridge was in a poor state due to lack of funding, with no separate secondary schools in the countryside; all children between the ages of three and fourteen were educated in their village school- house, often in one room and by the same, single teacher for their entire school career. Morris envisioned integrated between secondary and community education accessible by all those living in the villages and small towns around Cambridgeshire: the idea of 'village colleges'. He described this as \\"raising the school leaving age to ninety\\", and firmly believed that education, both formal and informal, should be a lifelong process. In the 1930s his visions materialised as the village colleges he had initially only hoped for, and the first four village colleges in Cambridgeshire were opened before the country became heavily involved in the conflicts of the Second World War. The Old Granary, Silver Street, Cambridge, Morris's home until 1946, where he is commemorated by a blue plaque Until 1946, Morris lived at The Old Granary in Silver Street, Cambridge, where he was the tenant of Maud Darwin, daughter-in-law of the naturalist Charles Darwin. A blue plaque on the house commemorates Morris. Henry Morris' idea evolved from what was initially seen by many in the government as a radical, liberal, paternalistic approach to delivering secondary education; to a system of education that was adopted by many other counties within the United Kingdom and abroad, due to its proven success in Cambridgeshire. By the time of his death in 1962, there were many village colleges successfully delivering education to both secondary school students (11- to 16-year-olds), and members of their local communities of all ages. Today the concept lives on to great success in Cambridgeshire and many other areas of the country. Comberton Village College in South Cambridgeshire has, in several recent years, been at or near the top of the league tables for state comprehensive schools in England. The system of whole community education, as used by Comberton Village College, was complimented by British Prime Minister, Tony Blair - a true reflection of the success of Henry Morris' concept. He died on 10 December 1961 at Hill End Hospital, St Albans, where he had spent his last months; a simple cremation ceremony at Golders Green Crematorium took place on 14 December 1961. Village colleges The following village colleges were founded by Morris. *Sawston Village College (1930) *Bottisham Village College (1937) *Linton Village College (1937) *Impington Village College (1939) *Bassingbourn Village College (1954) Two further colleges were opened by him shortly after his retirement from the post in 1954. *Soham Village College (1958) *Swavesey Village College (1958) *Comberton Village College (1959) Henry Morris Trust The Henry Morris Trust was established in his memory by a group of his friends.

The town garrison, under the command of Colonel Antonio Aranda Mata, declared for the Nationalist uprising and held out until relieved by a Nationalist force. The uprising The Nationalists did not consider Oviedo, capital of the province of Asturias, as a likely place for a successful revolt, and initially it was considered a lost cause for the uprising. The town was the center of the Asturian October Revolution of 1934, and became an ongoing hive of revolutionary activity since the election of the Popular Front government earlier in the year.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War (1961), p. 148 Aranda was reputed to be a freemason and a Republican, and got along well with the local Republican officials; in addition, the Falange distrusted him.Gabriel Jackson, The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931-1939 (1965), p. 240 Aranda declared that he would be loyal to the Republic when the rebellion started on July 17, and he convinced the civil governor and the union leaders that all was calm. So satisfied were the authorities that 4,000 miners left by train for other parts of Asturias and Spain to fight in the growing conflict. Aranda secretly called in Civil Guard and Assault Guard personnel from all Asturias to concentrate at Oviedo. He had gained a reputation in Africa of being a top strategist, and after the miners left, he declared for the rebellion on July 19. The Falange, Civil Guard, and Assault Guard immediately rallied to his side.Hugh Thomas, (1961), p. 148 Aranda easily took over Oviedo as the republicans panicked, and the rest of Asturias became hostile toward him. Between the two large zones, east and west of Oviedo, Aranda was landlocked and surrounded in the town.Ronald Fraser, Blood of Spain, An Oral History of the Spanish Civil War (1979) p. 238-239. Aranda's plan The map shows the Province of Asturias. Oviedo is the dark area in the center. Aranda realized from the beginning that he would have to hold the town and had made intelligent and extensive preparations in the process. He had carefully studied the defense of the place, and having at first much equipment from the barracks in Oviedo, he sited over 100 Hotchkiss machine guns in five strategic locations in about a nine-mile perimeter around the town. The town was not that easy to defend as it was surrounded on all sides by heights, but Aranda took that into consideration and secured the heights in preparation of laying down curtains of fire against the invaders. Aranda's tactics were novel for the time as they considered that a town as vulnerable as Oviedo could be held by firepower alone. Aranda's plan did have one serious flaw as he only had about 3,000 defenders, counting regular forces, guards, and volunteers. That meant he could not occupy all of the heights, and this gave the attackers their one main advantage. The Republican government in Madrid had reinforced the garrison at Oviedo after the 1934 revolution and had sent large numbers of guns and amounts of ammunition for storage there. In addition to the large number of machine guns, Aranda had over a million rounds of ammunition at his disposal. During the relatively quiet time during August, Aranda improved his position by constant offensive thrusts and feints that kept the besiegers in doubt.Ronald Fraser, pp. 247-248. The siege begins The map shows location of Oviedo in relation to the rest of Spain. Since the siege had no regular Republican ground forces, their \\"army\\" consisted almost solely of militia from the Popular Front parties and the allied Anarchists, and they began besieging Oviedo on July 20, but at the same time had to conduct the Siege of Gijón, also in Asturias. The Nationalists at Gijón's Simancas Barracks held out until August 16. Thereafter, the Popular Front forces could start to concentrate on Oviedo.Hugh Thomas, (1961), p. 254. The final Nationalist resistance ended in Gijón on August 21, and the Republican Gijón militia could now join the siege of Oviedo. The fact was, however, that about two hundred defenders had tied down the entire militia of that area for a month. Valuable time had been gained by the Nationalists and lost by the Republicans.Ronald Fraser, p. 241 After the end of the conflict in Gijón, the Popular Front forces were able to lay close siege to Oviedo. Most of the attacking militia were miners from the many Asturian mines. The besieging force, though, had several problems; it lacked professionalism with few, if any, trained military men as almost all such troops, including a majority of the Assault Guards, had rallied to the uprising. In addition, a Nationalist relief force was on the way from Galicia, and the siege in Gijón had drained away forces needed to oppose that advance. The relief force had made substantial progress towards Oviedo, and the Popular Front forces had little proper equipment to conduct a siege with the exception of dynamite. Last, but not least, was the terrain. With the seizure of the heights around Oviedo, Aranda was confident that the town was well prepared for defense.Ronald Fraser, pp. 245-246. The attackers tighten the siege Two union members, Otero, a socialist miner, and Higinio Carrocera, an anarchist steelworker, assumed leadership of the siege.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, (2001), p. 371. The attackers had cut off the water supply from the outset. The defenders, however, made the city reservoir one of their defended strong points, and with rationing were able to endure the siege. Despite their efforts, however, water could not be used for sanitation. Oviedo was known as a warehouse center for all Asturias, and so the garrison and populace had plenty of food at first. Little fighting occurred until September 4, when the attackers launched a ferocious aerial and artillery bombardment. An estimated 1,500 bombs were dropped on Oviedo, cutting off the gas, electric, and telephone systems, causing a total blackout of the town. Four days later, supported by an improvised armor-plated steamroller and aerial support, the attackers tried to take the most remote outpost. The defenders reacted by raising several artillery pieces on sandbags to act as anti- aircraft guns. The Nationalist troops were also supported by three Trubia A-4 tanks from the Infantry Regiment Milán. The Trubia was basically a Spanish version of the Renault FT. After a 12-hour battle, the attackers were driven off.Ronald Fraser, p. 248 The heavy shelling had killed a large number of civilians, but more died due to the lack of water for sanitation. Many people who were sympathetic to the Popular Front joined the forces defending Oviedo because a family member was killed or injured by the attackers' explosives. There was a constant danger of in-town fighting between those loyal to the Republic and the defenders of the siege, but those fears quickly evaporated as the attackers intensified the bombardment and caused more civilian casualties. One advantage to the defenders was that a large portion of the population was politically neutral.Ronald Fraser, p. 249 A bomb from a Popular Front airstrike killed at least 120 civilians, most of them children and the elderly, on September 10https://www.lne.es/oviedo/2010/09/21/huerfanos-casa- chorin/970455.html The attackers tightened the siege even further as September wore on. Because of the lack of water for sanitation, typhoid broke out and claimed many lives, especially the physically weak, the old, and the very young. As an aside, Oviedo was remarkable during the siege in that the defenders executed none of the political prisoners whom they held in captivity, which was unique at this time on both sides early in the war.Ronald Fraser, p. 250 The final assault begins October 4 was the day before the second anniversary of the beginning of the Asturias Revolution of 1934, and the Popular Front militias made an all-out attack on that day. The attackers were in a hurry since units from the tough Army of Africa had reinforced the Nationalist relief column from Galicia. Although the Popular Front had held up that relief column for two weeks, it was only 15 miles from Oviedo. Aranda had lost half of his defenders, and the attackers rolled over one of his defense points as he lost part of the high ground around the town. The fighting raged for a week and, one by one, the defenders' strong points fell to the attackers. Aranda abandoned what was left of the perimeter and pulled his survivors back into the town, and by that time he had used 90% of his ammunition. The defenders ran out of machine gun ammunition and the fighting reverted to hand to hand combat. The attackers fought from house to house by cutting holes in the walls joining the houses. The defenders were almost out of ammunition when several Nationalist airmen managed to drop 30,000 rounds to them.Ronald Fraser, pp. 250-252, inclusive. Aranda's last stand Aranda had only 500 defenders left and he pulled them into the center of the town for a last stand. By that time, the Popular Front militia captured Oviedo's last power plant, leaving the entire town powerless. Aranda retreated into the barracks in the middle of the defense, and with a radio powered by a car battery, he exhorted the defenders to \\"fight like Spaniards to the end\\". He sent a message to the Nationalist relief column from Galicia to state that his troops were out of ammunition, but that they would fight to the last. The Popular Front militias had suffered enormous losses themselves, estimated at least 5,000 casualties; they were low on ammunition but were making slow progress. Then, on October 16, with the defenders facing annihilation, the Galician relief column arrived and the Popular Front militias, almost out of ammunition, halted their assault. Relief and end of siege The Nationalists won a narrow corridor into the city and held it until the end of the War in the North a year later. The Popular Front militias abandoned the town and retreated to their positions occupied at the start of the siege. Oviedo, however, was no longer in danger.Ronald Fraser, pp. 252-254, inclusive. Aranda would continue to serve the Nationalist cause including the Battle of Teruel and other conflicts during the war.

He is also the President of the Ghana Heart Foundation and was the Chief Executive Officer of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. A well-known figure in his country, Frimpong-Boateng was elected a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 2002.  Career  Frimpong-Boateng attended Sekondi College in Ghana. The young Frimpong-Boateng studied physics and mathematics thinking that he would become an engineer. Nonetheless, he later decided to seek a career as a doctor when he was offered a scholarship to study medicine in Germany. His father Kofi Frimpong had died from heart injuries due to a road traffic accident prior to his birth., so he thought he could help people in similar situations. After finishing his post-graduate studies, he returned to his birthplace to practice as Ghana's first locally based cardiothoracic surgeon. He is currently the Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation in Ghana. In 1992, he set up the National Cardiothoracic Centre at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital. There were no cardiothoracic surgery facilities in the country at the time, so he aimed the centre to teach to young surgeons and assist new patients. In Ghana, primary health care issues such as malaria and limited childhood vaccinations are greatly underserved due to lack of infrastructure, lack of funding, transportation, and quality and safety, making skilled speciality care a luxury often attained only by those rich enough to leave the country. He is currently the Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation. He joined the University of Ghana Medical School as a lecturer in 2000 and was promoted associate professor the same year. He was made a full professor in 2002. He also served as the head of the department of Surgery at the University of Ghana Medical School, prior to his current appointment as the Chief Executive of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in 2002. He was elected to the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 2002 and gave his inaugural lecture the following year. Frimpong-Boateng also runs a charitable foundation, the Ghana Heart Foundation, which is responsible for paying for heart surgery for some indigent Ghanaians under his care. Politics In March 2006, Frimpong-Boateng announced his intention to seek the nomination as the candidate of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) for the December 2008 National Presidential Elections. Documentaries were made about his life and his hopes, but at the end, the candidate elected was Nana Akuffo-Addo. Regardless of his results, he declared he is still concerned with political issues in relation to education and health problems.Interview with Errol Barnett: , October 2013.

They are one of only a few pairs of brothers to have received the medal. Biography Both brothers enlisted as privates in the 4th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment; Allen joined from Port Jarvis, New York in June 1863, and was assigned to Company I, while James joined from Sandy Creek, New York in February 1864, and was assigned to Company K; both brothers claimed to be 18 years old at the time of their enlistments. Allen mustered out with the regiment in September 1865. James, who was wounded 2 days after their MOH actions, was discharged the following month.Regimental roster During the Appomattox Campaign of March and April, 1865, their regiment served as infantry rather than artillery and was attached to a brigade in the 1st Division, II Corps, under division commander General Nelson A. Miles. On April 2, 1865, the Thompsons' brigade was pursuing Confederate forces outside of Petersburg, Virginia, following the Union victory at Five Forks the previous day.The Thompsons' Medal of Honor citations incorrectly give the date of their action as April 1, 1865 Upon coming across seemingly deserted enemy fortifications at White Oak Road and fearing an ambush, General Miles called for volunteers to reconnoiter the area. Seven men, including both Thompson brothers, stepped forward. Miles instructed them to advance through the trees to a designated spot in the distance and, once there, to signal back that the way was clear. If they encountered Confederate soldiers, they were to alert the brigade of the enemy's presence by opening fire immediately. The seven men advanced through the trees and were approximately one-fourth of the way to the designated spot when they were surprised by a group of about 50 Confederate soldiers. Ordered to lay down their guns and surrender, the Union men instead chose to fire, even though they were less than 100 feet from the numerically superior enemy force.Deeds of Valor, p. 502 James Thompson explained: Five of the group of seven were killed by the Confederate return fire, only the Thompson brothers survived. Allen Thompson retreated back to the Union lines, uninjured, while James Thompson lay severely wounded.Deeds of Valor, pp. 501-502 Alerted by the rifle fire, the Union forces commenced an attack; the Thompsons' brigade held its position while the 2nd Division flanked and routed the enemy force. A burial detail sent to inter the dead of the small reconnaissance party found James Thompson still alive. Thirty-one years after the battle, on April 22, 1896, Allen and James Thompson were each issued the Medal of Honor for their actions at White Oak Road. The Thompsons' official Medal of Honor citations are nearly identical; James' citation reads: > Made a hazardous reconnaissance through timber and slashings, preceding the > Union line of battle, signaling the troops and leading them through the > obstructions. Allen Thompson died at age 58 and was buried in Lakeview Cemetery, Cheyenne, Wyoming. James Thompson died fifteen years later at age 71 and was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, San Diego, California.

He is a senior officer in the Spectrum Organisation, which is committed to defending Earth against the Mysterons, and is the best friend of Captain Scarlet. Conception Captain Blue was among the first characters to be conceived by series creator Gerry Anderson who, having determined that \\"Scarlet\\" would make for an unusual codename for the series' protagonist, resolved that his mission partner could be codenamed \\"Blue\\". Audio commentary for \\"Attack on Cloudbase\\". Script editor Tony Barwick, who commented on what he perceived as the series' \\"quite formalised writing\\", wrote Blue as \\"the foil, the nice guy\\" of Captain Scarlet.Bentley 2001, p. 31. In a 1982 interview for Starlog magazine, Captain Blue voice actor Ed Bishop described his casting by the Andersons: \\"There was an actor in the series named Cy Grant [voice of the Lieutenant Green character]. We happened to have the same agent and Sylvia Anderson had called to ask about him. The girl at the agency said, 'You people use a lot of Americans on your shows and we have this American actor.' Sylvia told her to send me along. It's just as simple as that.\\" Gerry approved of what Bishop termed his \\"wall-to-wall corporate voice\\", judging it suitable for the role of a \\"smooth-talking co-star\\". Although Bishop believed that he was the template for Blue's likeness, the puppet sculptor, Terry Curtis, had in fact already made a rough modelling in his own image, and simply changed the hair colour from brown to blond at the direction of Sylvia Anderson (Bishop himself, like Curtis, was darker-haired).Bentley 2001, p. 17. The puppet's total cost was 500 guineas, or £525. It has been suggested that Blue's blue-eyed and blond-haired appearance influenced that of Commander Ed Straker, Bishop's live-action role in the later Anderson series UFO. Appearance =Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons= Blue, as depicted in the 1960s series, was born on 26 August 2035 to a Boston, Massachusetts financier. After graduating from Harvard University, he embarked on a career as a pilot before joining Spectrum. Blue is courageous, hard-working and a natural leader, but also deferential to the commands of Colonel White. He regularly partners Captain Scarlet on missions and, although his best friend is indestructible, frequently fears for his safety. For example, in the episode \\"Winged Assassin\\", Blue attempts to prevent Scarlet from suicidally ramming the wheels of a Mysteronised airliner using a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle (SPV). He serves as acting commanding officer of Cloudbase during White's absence in \\"White as Snow\\", and stands in for Lieutenant Green as communications officer in \\"Avalanche\\". Blue occasionally disobeys commands out of his own curiosity. For example, in \\"Renegade Rocket\\", he refuses to leave a military base that is being targeted by its own missile, electing to remain behind with Scarlet in an attempt to find the self-destruct code, and in \\"Special Assignment\\", being unaware that Scarlet's discharge from Spectrum is in fact part of the Captain's undercover mission, leaves Cloudbase without authorisation to find and reason with his friend. Physically active, Blue regularly practises surfing, water-skiing and deep-sea harpoon fishing. A romance with Symphony Angel is suggested in some episodes: in \\"Manhunt\\", Blue is distressed by Captain Black's abduction of Symphony and is anxious to venture into a nuclear power station to rescue her, while in \\"Attack on Cloudbase\\", the two characters share a long gaze after Symphony experiences a disturbing nightmare about the base's destruction. =Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet= Blue's new likeness was based on that of Casper Van Dien as Johnny Rico in the film Starship Troopers (1997). In the 2005 remake, Blue is still a brave Spectrum officer and loyal companion; however, he is of stronger build and speaks with a rougher accent. He prefers to confront situations swiftly and has fewer reservations about using violence against the Mysterons than he did previously. He appears to have a romantic interest in Serena Lewis (the female Lieutenant Green), but this is never explicitly described as a relationship. Reception James Stansfield of the entertainment website Den of Geek describes Blue as Captain Scarlet's \\"trusty sidekick\\", adding that although the pair were equal in rank, Blue \\"was always the Robin to Scarlet's Batman\\". The character's subservience to Scarlet has been acknowledged by Bishop, who suggested that Blue \\"got a raw deal, because he was very heroic, you know. He was very close to Scarlet, and I pulled him out of some very sticky wickets\\". Cultural historian Nicholas J. Cull comments that Blue's nationality, coupled with his status as a \\"strong supporting character\\", is representative of a general shift away from the predominantly American protagonists of earlier Anderson series, including Thunderbirds.

Life story His real name is Osman İslamoğlu \\"Batur\\" is a title given to him by his nation in the sense of hero, brave. He was born in 1899 in Öngdirkara, in the Köktogay region of Altay. He is the son of İslâm Bey, a farmer of middle class from Altay Cossacks. The nomadic Kazakh grew up living his life. Osman Batur, who was a good rider and a master hunter before the age of 10, learned the fine arts of martial arts from Böke Batur, a Kazakh Turk, with whom he entered his service at the age of 12. Boke Boke Baturin Baturin then be defeated by the Chinese over Tibet after the decapitation of captured while trying to reach Turkey birthplace at the age of 40 were engaged in farming. In 1940, as the Chinese administration increased the pressure, he took his gun and went to the mountain alone. He continued the struggle he started alone until his execution in Urumqi on 29 April 1951. Challenge Osman Batur who started his struggle against the Chinese and Russians in 1941, aimed to liberate all Altai lands and East Turkestan from the Chinese and Russians II. During the World War II, with the increasing pressure on the Turks in East Turkestan, the reaction movements gained strength and prepared the ground for the rise of Osman Batur. Osman Batur, who started to clean the Altays from the Chinese, seemed to have reached his goal in 1943. With a ceremony held in Bulgun on July 22, 1943, the inn of Osman Batur Altay Cossacks was declared. By 1945, except for a few cities in East Turkestan, the control was taken by the Turks. When the situation became intolerable and dangerous for the Chinese, the Chinese armies carried out harsh and intense operations in the region. Although Osman Batur, who was removed from Targabatay and Altays, started the fight with thirty thousand people, by 1950 this number was approximately four thousand. There was also a struggle between Alibek Hakim and his comrades. Osman Batur, who was trapped in Kanambal in 1951, was captured and taken to Urumqi. Osman Batur was circulated and exposed in public and was killed by shooting on April 29, 1951. In Xinjiang he led the Kazakh people to fight against the İslamic. He was captured in Hami (Eastern Xinjiang), and executed in Urumqi on April 29, 1951, after resisting the Communist takeover. After his death many of his followers fled over the Himalayan mountains. Afterwards they were airlifted to Turkey, where they then lived.

C03. Gameplay The goal of the game is to press down on the plastic teeth from a crocodile toy's mouth. If the \\"sore tooth\\" is pressed, the mouth will snap shut and lunge toward whoever pulled the sore tooth, and the person who caused the mouth to shut is the loser. The travel version of Crocodile Dentist featured slightly different gameplay, where instead of pulling the teeth out of the crocodile's mouth the players had to push the crocodile's teeth down into its gum (this objective would be used in future versions of the full size game). Development Crocodile Dentist went through several changes during its development phase. Fuhrer and his technicians were told to tweak the length and speed of the crocodile's lunging motion so that the toy would not cause eye injuries. Fuhrer also added a pair of plastic pliers to quell fears that children would hurt their fingers. However, the game testers later thought that the toy lacked excitement, and though the pliers remained in the final product, Fuhrer restored the original lunging motion.

It began as a college feature.  Publication history  In the fall of 1975, at the beginning of his final year as a fine arts student, Tim Downs brought Downstown to Indiana University's paper, the Indiana Daily Student, which immediately began to publish the strip as a daily feature. The strip soon began syndication to other college newspapers. The first college to ever publish Downstown was the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, New York. For the next five years, Downstown appeared in a variety of campus papers across the United States. During this period, three collections of Downstown were published by the Indiana Daily Student: This is Winning?; With Love, Chuck; and Get in There and Quit. In the fall of 1979, Universal Press Syndicate agreed to begin syndication of Downstown. Universal felt that a college setting was too narrow for a commercial strip, so Downstown became a strip about singles. The first syndicated Downstown was released on March 24, 1980, in 46 newspapers. The strip appeared as a daily and Sunday feature for the next six years. The strip ended with a week-long going-away party attended by characters from other strips. In the final strip (published February 1, 1986), the main character, John, poked a hole in the bottom of the strip border with a pickaxe and the characters were sucked through the opening. Another collection was self-published by Downs following the end of the strip, The Laylo Papers: The Complete Guide to Relationships. The book remains in print and available for direct order from Downs.  Characters and story  In the strip, Josh and John were college roommates sharing an off-campus apartment, Fred was a student who directed registration and worked at a local restaurant, and Chuck Laylo was an exceptionally smooth and cool fraternity man—a member of the imaginary Sigma Theta fraternity.

The ship was the subject of the television series Tall Ship Chronicles which documented her second voyage around the world in 2001. The ship has carried out seven world voyages to date - completing the seventh one in 2019. While flagged in the Cook Islands, the ship's unofficial home port is Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In December 2006 a crew member, Laura Gainey, was swept overboard from the ship in the Atlantic Ocean and presumed drowned. The death was investigated by the Cook Islands government, which concluded that the death was accidental. A subsequent investigation by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada found that a lack of safety equipment and the ships' master's decision to sail with an inexperienced and untrained crew contributed to the death. Configuration Picton Castle is rigged as a three-masted barque, is long, with a riveted steel hull, clear oiled pine decks, steel masts and wooden and steel yards. She carries of sail. The ship displaces 300 tons. She has a 690-horsepower diesel engine for the times when sailing is not feasible. The ship has space for roughly 52 people, consisting of about 12 professional crew and 40 sail trainees. Operational history =As a trawler, minesweeper, and freighter= Picton Castle was originally built as a motorized fishing trawler in 1928. She was built along with four other trawlers for the same company and operated out of Swansea, Wales. The ship was named after the Welsh castle of the same name. In August 1939, the Royal Navy requisitioned the trawler for use in World War II and refit her as a minesweeper. While sweeping mines near Norway, she made way for the port of Bergen for repairs. The Germans had just left Norway, and the sight of the Union Jack-bearing HMS Picton Castle earned her the title \\"The Liberator of Norway.\\" Following World War II, the ship was renamed Dolmar and worked as a freighter in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. =Acquisition and refit= During the early 1990s, Daniel Moreland acquired the ship while seeking a vessel to convert to a barque. With the help of a small crew he brought her across the Atlantic Ocean, eventually ending up in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia where she began her multimillion-dollar refit. =As a sailing ship= Line art of Picton Castle Picton Castle's first world circumnavigation voyage took place from 1997-1999. She has since sailed around the world six more times, for a total of seven global circumnavigations. She has also visited the Great Lakes twice, sailed numerous times on tours of the East Coast of the Americas, completed a Caribbean Voyage and in 2008 sailed to Europe, Africa and the Caribbean on a Voyage of the Atlantic. The ship is used for educational voyages and sail training, with a core crew of 10 to 12 teaching up to 40 trainees basic sailing techniques and ship maintenance. When not sailing, the ship operates a \\"Bosun school\\", teaching ship-related skills such as rigging and boat-repair. In the spring of 2007, Picton Castle was featured in Mark Burnett's CBS reality show Pirate Master. The show was filmed in the Caribbean island of Dominica and premiered May 31, 2007. In October 2013 Picton Castle participated in the International Fleet Review 2013, the centennial anniversary of the Royal Australian Navy, in Sydney, Australia along with fifteen other tall ships. In 2014 she sailed in the South Pacific before returning to Lunenburg in late May, 2015. In June 2019 Picton Castle returned from its seventh around-the-world voyage. Plans for an eighth voyage in 2020 were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Death of Laura Gainey On the night of December 8, 2006, as Picton Castle was roughly south-east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the ship encountered bad weather. A wave swamped the ship, sweeping overboard crew member Laura Gainey, daughter of Bob Gainey. Gainey was not wearing a life jacket or a survival suit but was expected to be able to survive up to 36 hours due to warm water temperatures. A search for her by the Picton Castle, aircraft of the United States and Canadian Coast Guards, and nearby merchant vessels, was unsuccessful and called off after three days, and the ship continued on its voyage. An investigator from Maritime Cook Islands interviewed the crew on its arrival in Grenada. A formal inquiry was established in March 2007, and reported back in July, concluding that Gainey was an \\"unlucky victim\\" of an accident and that no changes needed to be made. A slightly rewritten version of the report was issued in August 2007 recommending the use of safety harnesses. In November 2007 the Transportation Safety Board of Canada announced it would conduct its own inquiry into the death. Later that month an investigation by the CBC program The Fifth Estate claimed that the Picton Castle was ill-prepared to sail, discouraged the use of safety equipment, and had doctored statements given to the Maritime Cook islands inquiry. It also alleged that Maritime Cook Islands had ignored the initial investigation report and instead cast blame upon Gainey. In July 2008 the TSB released its inquiry. The report found among the \\"causes and contributing factors\\" that the decision to set to sea did not sufficiently take into account the long-range weather forecasts, especially in view of the crew's qualification and experience; Gainey did not get enough sleep in the 1–2 days before the accident; most likely miscommunication on the fatal evening resulted in her still getting up every hour instead of getting rest; the port breezeway of the ship was designated \\"off-limits\\" by the ship's master, but due to inefficient communication, Gainey seems to have remained unaware of that order; in the heavy weather, no safety nets were rigged on the ship; safety lines were rigged, but safety harnesses were not worn, and there were no \\"established fastening points\\" (other than the safety lines) to which to clip safety harnesses. The captain of the Picton Castle accepted the findings, and adopted improved safety procedures.

Set against the backdrop of the racial violence that engulfed the Indian city of Bombay in 1992 and 1993, the novel depicts the life of Chamdi, a ten-year-old orphan forced to survive on the streets after running away from his orphanage in a quest to find his father. The book was selected for inclusion in the 2008 edition of Canada Reads, in which it was championed by author Donna Morrissey. Synopsis Abandoned as an infant, ten-year-old Chamdi has spent his entire life in a Bombay orphanage. There he has learned to find solace in his everyday surroundings: the smell of the first rains, the vibrant pinks and reds of the bougainvilleas that blossom in the courtyard, the life-size statue of Jesus, the \\"beautiful giant,\\" to whom he confides his hopes and fears in the prayer room. Though he rarely ventures outside the orphanage, he entertains an idyllic fantasy of what the city is like – a paradise he calls Kahunsha, \\"the city of no sadness,\\" where children play cricket in the streets and where people will become one with all the colours known to man. Chamdi’s quiet life takes a sudden turn, however, when he learns that the orphanage will be shut down by land developers. He decides that he must run away in search of his long-lost father, taking nothing with him but the blood-stained white cloth he was left in as a baby. Outside the walls of the orphanage, Chamdi quickly discovers that Bombay is nothing like Kahunsha. The streets are filthy and devoid of colour, and no one shows him an ounce of kindness. Just as he’s about to faint from hunasoned street children offer help: the lovely, sarcastic Guddi and her brother, the charming, scarred, and crippled Sumdi. After their father was crushed by a car before their eyes, the children were left to care for their insane mother and their infant brother. They soon initiate Chamdi into the brutal life of the city’s homeless, begging all day and handing over most of his earnings to Anand Bhai, a vicious underworld don who will happily mutilate or kill whoever dares to defy him. Determined to escape the desperation, filth, and violence of their lives, Guddi and Sumdi recruit Chamdi into their plot to steal from a temple. But when the robbery goes terribly awry, Chamdi finds himself in an even worse situation. The city has erupted in Hindu-Muslim violence and, held in Anand Bhai’s fierce grip, Chamdi is presented with a choice that threatens to rob him of his innocence forever.

It is a separate sump, connected to the main show tank. It is a \\"refugium\\" in the sense that it permits organisms to be maintained that would not survive in the main system, whether food animals, anaerobic denitrifying bacteria, or photosynthesizers. For some applications water flow is limited in order to protect plants or animals that require slow flow. The refugium light cycle can be operated opposite to the main tank, in order to keep total system pH more stable (due to the uptake of acid-forming CO2 by photosynthesis occurring in the refugium during its \\"daylight\\" hours). One volume guideline for a refugium is 1:10 main tank volume. A refugium may be used for one or more purposes such as denitrification, nutrient export, plankton production, circulation, surface agitation to improve oxygen exchange with the atmosphere or even aesthetic purposes. Construction Tropical marine refugiums often contain live rock and live sand, macroalgae, and sometimes scavenger microfauna such as micro brittle stars, tiny sea stars such as Asterina, snails, and worms.Calfo, A: \\"Book of Coral Propagation\\". Reading Trees Publication, 2009. To achieve maximum biological filtration through uptake of nutrients by macroalgae/mangroves, strong lighting is often utilized in the refugium. In this fashion, macroalgae algae growth is encouraged, competing with nuisance algae which would otherwise thrive in the main/display tank. Some also use refugiums to raise tiny brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, ostracods, amphipods, copepods and isopods for delicate fish like seahorses and dragonets to feed on. A sump is an additional tank often kept under the display tank that serves to house filtration and other miscellaneous equipment such as protein skimmers, reaction chambers, hoses, heaters and the like. This is especially common for show tanks and reef tanks. In addition to housing critical equipment, the sump serves to add volume to the total system; mitigating the effects of nutrient buildup or unintentional introduction of foreign substances. Tropical freshwater refugiums often contain large amounts of aquarium plants, primarily Vallisneria, Anubias, Cabomba, Echinodorus, Microsorum, Cladophora, Java moss and Fontinalis, but like marine tanks they often contain scavengers such as several species of prolific snails which are often Malaysian trumpet snails, Ramshorn snails and Physa and prolific shrimp such as cherry shrimp. Some use refugiums to raise microfauna Daphnia, Moina and Gammarus to supplement the diets of the fish in the main tank, particularly fish that are picky about their diet, such as freshwater pipefish. In home aquariums, the refugium is typically located in the cabinet underneath the main tank. By confining the plants and creatures to the refugium, the main tank remains clean and aesthetically pleasing, while the biological filtration takes place in the refugium.

Exposure therapy involves exposing the target patient to the anxiety source or its context without the intention to cause any danger. Doing so is thought to help them overcome their anxiety or distress. Procedurally, it is similar to the fear extinction paradigm developed studying laboratory rodents. Numerous studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and specific phobias. Medical uses =Generalized anxiety disorder= There is empirical evidence that exposure therapy can be an effective treatment for people with generalized anxiety disorder, citing specifically in vivo exposure therapy, which has greater effectiveness than imaginal exposure in regards to generalized anxiety disorder. The aim of in vivo exposure treatment is to promote emotional regulation using systematic and controlled therapeutic exposure to traumatic stimuli. =Phobia= Exposure therapy is the most successful known treatment for phobias. Several published meta-analyses included studies of one-to-three hour single-session treatments of phobias, using imaginal exposure. At a post- treatment follow-up four years later 90% of people retained a considerable reduction in fear, avoidance, and overall level of impairment, while 65% no longer experienced any symptoms of a specific phobia. Agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder are examples of phobias that have been successfully treated by exposure therapy. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help would not be available if things go wrong, originating from the Ancient Greek term \\"Agora\\" or Marketplace, while social anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by a significant amount of fear in one or more social situations. Such fears can be very debilitating in themselves, and in addition, patients often worry about showing anxiety and losing control in public. =Post-traumatic stress disorder= Virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy is a modern but effective treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This method was tested on several active duty Army soldiers, using an immersive computer simulation of military settings over six sessions. Self-reported PTSD symptoms of these soldiers were greatly diminished following the treatment. Exposure therapy has shown promise in the treatment of co-morbid PTSD and substance abuse. = Obsessive compulsive disorder = Exposure and response prevention (also known as exposure and ritual prevention; ERP or EX/RP) is a variant of exposure therapy that is recommended by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and the Mayo Clinic as first-line treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) citing that it has the richest empirical support for both youth and adolescent outcomes. ERP is predicated on the idea that a therapeutic effect is achieved as subjects confront their fears, but refrain from engaging in the escape response or ritual that delays or eliminates distress. In the case of individuals with OCD or an anxiety disorder, there is a thought or situation that causes distress. Individuals usually combat this distress through specific behaviors that include avoidance or rituals. However, ERP involves purposefully evoking fear, anxiety, and or distress in the individual by exposing him/her to the feared stimulus. The response prevention then involves having the individual refrain from the ritualistic or otherwise compulsive behavior that functions to decrease distress. The patient is then taught to tolerate distress until it fades away on its own, thereby learning that rituals are not always necessary to decrease distress or anxiety. Over repeated practice of ERP, patients with OCD expect to find that they can have obsessive thoughts and images but not have the need to engage in compulsive rituals to decrease distress. The AACAP's practise parameters for OCD recommends cognitive behavioral therapy, and more specifically ERP, as first line treatment for youth with mild to moderate severity OCD and combination psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for severe OCD. The Cochrane Review's examinations of different randomized control trials echoes repeated findings of the superiority of ERP over waitlist control or pill-placebos, the superiority of combination ERP and pharmacotherapy, but similar effect sizes of efficacy between ERP or pharmacotherapy alone. Techniques Exposure therapy is based on the principle of respondent conditioning often termed Pavlovian extinction. The exposure therapist identifies the cognitions, emotions and physiological arousal that accompany a fear-inducing stimulus and then tries to break the pattern of escape that maintains the fear. This is done by exposing the patient to progressively stronger fear-inducing stimuli. Fear is minimized at each of a series of steadily escalating steps or challenges (a hierarchy), which can be explicit (\\"static\\") or implicit (\\"dynamic\\" — see Method of Factors) until the fear is finally gone.Miltenberger, R. G. \\"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\\". Thomson/Wadsworth, 2008. p. 552. The patient is able to terminate the procedure at any time. There are three types of exposure procedures. The first is in vivo or \\"real life.\\" This type exposes the patient to actual fear-inducing situations. For example, if someone fears public speaking, the person may be asked to give a speech to a small group of people. The second type of exposure is imaginal, where patients are asked to imagine a situation that they are afraid of. This procedure is helpful for people who need to confront feared thoughts and memories. The third type of exposure is interoceptive, which may be used for more specific disorders such as panic or post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients confront feared bodily symptoms such as increased heart rate and shortness of breath. All types of exposure may be used together or separately. While evidence clearly supports the effectiveness of exposure therapy, some clinicians are uncomfortable using imaginal exposure therapy, especially in cases of PTSD. They may not understand it, are not confident in their own ability to use it, or more commonly, they see significant contraindications for their client. Flooding therapy also exposes the patient to feared stimuli, but it is quite distinct in that flooding starts at the most feared item in a fear hierarchy, while exposure starts at the least fear-inducing. =Exposure and response prevention= In the exposure and response prevention (ERP or EX/RP) variation of exposure therapy, the resolution to refrain from the escape response is to be maintained at all times and not just during specific practice sessions. Thus, not only does the subject experience habituation to the feared stimulus, but they also practice a fear-incompatible behavioral response to the stimulus. The distinctive feature is that individuals confront their fears and discontinue their escape response. The American Psychiatric Association recommends ERP for the treatment of OCD, citing that ERP has the richest empirical support. While this type of therapy typically causes some short-term anxiety, this facilitates long-term reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms. Generally, ERP incorporates a relapse prevention plan toward the end of the course of therapy. History The use of exposure as a mode of therapy began in the 1950s, at a time when psychodynamic views dominated Western clinical practice and behavioral therapy was first emerging. South African psychologists and psychiatrists first used exposure as a way to reduce pathological fears, such as phobias and anxiety-related problems, and they brought their methods to England in the Maudsley Hospital training program. Joseph Wolpe (1915–1997) was one of the first psychiatrists to spark interest in treating psychiatric problems as behavioral issues. He sought consultation with other behavioral psychologists, among them James G. Taylor (1897–1973), who worked in the psychology department of the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Although most of his work went unpublished, Taylor was the first psychologist known to use exposure therapy treatment for anxiety, including methods of situational exposure with response prevention—a common exposure therapy technique still being used. Since the 1950s several sorts of exposure therapy have been developed, including systematic desensitization, flooding, implosive therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, in vivo exposure therapy, and imaginal exposure therapy. Mindfulness A 2015 review pointed out parallels between exposure therapy and mindfulness, stating that mindful meditation \\"resembles an exposure situation because [mindfulness] practitioners 'turn towards their emotional experience', bring acceptance to bodily and affective responses, and refrain from engaging in internal reactivity towards it.\\" Imaging studies have shown that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and the amygdala are all affected by exposure therapy; imaging studies have shown similar activity in these regions with mindfulness training. Research Exposure therapy can be investigated in the laboratory using Pavlovian extinction paradigms. Using rodents such as rats or mice to study extinction allows for the investigation of underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved, as well as testing of pharmacological adjuncts to improve extinction learning.

The group is composed of vocalists, songwriters and keyboardists Marianthi Melitsi and Sophie Sarigiannidou. The name Marsheaux is derived from the first syllable of each band member's name. Both members sing almost exclusively in English. Andy McCluskey of OMD said about this band: \\"I do have a soft spot for Marsheaux I have to say. They have a certain sort of wispy, melancholic charm\\". History Marianthi Melitsi and Sophie Sarigiannidou were born in Thessaloniki, Greece. In 2000, they moved to Athens and founded Marsheaux in 2003 to further their appreciation of electronic pop music. In 2015, they explained to a music blog called AZLTRON the origin of the band: \\"We were at a Depeche Mode party in Athens 12 years ago, and the guys from Undo Records told us that we can only play Depeche Mode themes in our synths. So we decided to form a band and make a track for a compilation they were working on, called Nu Romantics. We did a cover of Gershon Kingsley's \\"Popcorn\\", we found a name, and won the bet. We are very glad we won the bet cause if we hadn't, we would have to clean their warehouse and keep it clean for a whole year\\". Marsheaux came to national prominence in Greece with their debut single, a cover of Gershon Kingsley's \\"Popcorn\\". The single received extensive airplay in Greece and mainland Europe. They continued to gain international recognition for their remixes of \\"Will I Ever\\" by In Vox featuring Andy Bell of Erasure. Now signed to Undo Records, Marsheaux released their debut album E-Bay Queen in June 2004. The album played heavily on Marsheaux's stated influences of The Human League, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, New Order, Erasure, Yazoo and Depeche Mode. E-Bay Queen was critically well received internationally. In December 2006, Undo Records released Sophie and Marianthi's follow up album Peekaboo. The album included two covers, \\"Regret\\" by New Order and \\"The Promise\\" by When In Rome. The site Electronically Yours rated it \\"Album of the Year 2007\\". The single \\"Hanging On\\" was released in 2007. As well as recording original material, Marsheaux also remixed existing tracks of artists such as Moby, Depeche Mode, Sakis Rouvas, Gwen Stefani and Hurts. In 2008, Marsheaux recorded a version of the song \\"She's Leaving\\" by OMD. They also issued the limited 7\\" vinyl \\"Ghost\\", which included the B-side \\"Bizarre Love Duo\\". In July 2009, the band released their third album, Lumineux Noir, at Undo Records/Out of Line. The album was issued in two versions: the Standard edition with 13 tracks and the Limited edition that included a bonus disc with remixes and a new song. According to the Side-Line magazine, it did not \\"bring an evolution in sound, but shows a growing maturity in songwriting and production\\". It is reminiscent of 1980s synthpop with tracks that have been compared to Ladytron, The Chemical Brothers and Client. Two singles supported the album: \\"Breakthrough\\" and \\"Summer\\". In May 2011, Marsheaux released a new song, \\"Can You Stop Me?\\". In May 2012, the band issued the compilation of mostly unreleased material and rare songs, E-Bay Queen is Dead. A fourth album, Inhale, followed in 2013, along with a compilation drawn from all four studio albums, Odyssey. In 2015, Marsheaux released their fifth studio album A Broken Frame, which is a cover album of Depeche Mode's 1982 LP of the same name. It has been seen as faithful to the original but with an updated sound, including some darker and slower interpretations of tracks like \\"The Meaning Of Love\\" and \\"A Photograph Of You\\" as well as a trip-hop version of \\"Shouldn’t Have Done That\\". In May 2016, Marsheaux released a new single \\"Safe Tonight\\", that includes original and extended versions of the song and remixes by Nikonn and Fotonovela. This single is from their sixth studio album Ath.Lon, released on June 16, 2016. Touring Marsheaux live at Infest 2008 Marsheaux performed live at various festivals including Infest, Pluswelt, Amphi and Exit. The duo also played support slots for OMD and Róisín Murphy in Greece, and Client in Germany. Both band members have regular guest DJ slots in clubs in Athens. Equipment As well as being vocalists, both musicians are skilled multi-instrumentalists. Marianthi plays Microkorg, Minimoog, Roland SH101, Speak & Math and Yamaha CS01. Sophie plays Microkorg, Korg MS-10, Roland Alpha Juno2, Akai AX80, Roland CR-78, and Kurzweil K2000.

It is a satire of Boston's upper class. The title character is a Harvard-educated WASP living on Beacon Hill in downtown Boston. It is an epistolary novel, made up mostly of letters to and from the title character. The book was acclaimed as the first \\"serious\\" work by Marquand, who had previously been known for his Mr. Moto spy novels and other popular fiction. It was a bestseller and won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1938. An article in The New Yorker decades later called the book the \\"best-wrought fictional monument to the nation's Protestant elite that we know of.\\"Spaulding, Martha. \\"Martini Age Victorian\\", The Atlantic, May 2004. The narrative begins in the early 1930s. Wealthy Bostonian John Apley engages a somewhat pompous literary man to produce a truthful book about his recently deceased father, George. This writer, named Willing, specializes in flowery, sanitized tributes to local luminaries, and he is disturbed by the young man's request for frankness, especially since George Apley was his good friend, but he reluctantly agrees. Willing moves chronologically through Apley's 66 years of life, using letters from his late subject's personal papers. He frequently interjects his own comments, declaring his admiration for Apley the public- spirited citizen and bemoaning the disclosure of \\"scandalous\\" information about the man and his family. Willing, a comic character in his own right, longs for the old days in Boston, when subjects such as love affairs, alcoholism, mental illness and crime were kept out of the papers if they involved prominent people, and respectability was more important than personal happiness. The image of George Apley that emerges in the course of the novel is alternately hilarious and poignant, and ultimately sympathetic. Apley is revealed as a man who was deeply conflicted about his status among Boston's elite, sometimes feeling imprisoned in his privileged world, but sometimes passionately defending the old order. In 1944, the novel was adapted as a Broadway play, and in 1947, it was made into a feature film starring Ronald Colman. In 1955, 20th Century Fox produced a TV series starring Raymond Massey and Joanne Woodward that ran until 1957.

Escaped Africans who were enslaved during Spanish rule over Jamaica (1493–1656) may have been the first to develop such refugee communities. The British, who invaded the island in 1655, expanded the importation of slaves to support their extensive development of sugar-cane plantations. Africans in Jamaica continually fought and revolted, with many who escaped becoming maroons. The revolts had the effect of disrupting the sugar economy in Jamaica and making it less profitable. The revolts simmered down after the British government signed treaties with the Leeward Maroons in 1739 and the Windward Maroons in 1740, which required them to support the institution of slavery. The importance of the Maroons to the colonial authorities declined after slavery was abolished in 1838. The Windward Maroons and those from the Cockpit Country resisted conquest in the First Maroon War ( 1728 to 1740), which the government ended in 1739–1740 by making treaties to grant lands and to respect maroon autonomy, in exchange for peace and aiding the colonial militia if needed against external enemies. Tension between British colonial Governor Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, and the majority of the Leeward Maroons resulted in the Second Maroon War from 1795 to 1796. Although the governor promised leniency if the maroons surrendered, he later betrayed them and, supported by the Assembly, insisted on deporting just under 600 maroons to British settlements in Nova Scotia, where British slaves who escaped from the United States were also resettled. The deported maroons were unhappy with conditions in Canada, and in 1800 a majority left, having obtained passage to Freetown, eight years after the Sierra Leone Company established it in West Africa (in present-day Sierra Leone) as a British colony. Origins The word \\"maroon\\" is derived via French from the Spanish word cimarrón, meaning \\"wild\\" or \\"untamed\\". This word usually referred to runaways, castaways, or the shipwrecked; those marooned probably would never return. The origin of the Spanish word cimarrón is unknown. When the British invaded Jamaica in 1655, most Spanish colonists fled. Many of their slaves escaped and, together with free blacks and mulattoes, former slaves, and some native Taíno,Michael Sivapragasam, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739–1842, PhD Dissertation, African-Caribbean Institute of Jamaica library (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 23–24.E. Kofi Agorsah, \\"Archaeology of Maroon Settlements in Jamaica\\", Maroon Heritage: Archaeological, Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives, ed. E. Kofi Agorsah (Kingston: University of the West Indies Canoe Press, 1994), pp. 180–81. coalesced into a number of ethnically diverse groups in the Jamaican interior. Spanish Maroons Some Spanish Maroons created palenques, or stockaded mountain farms, first at Lluidas Vale, in modern-day St Catharine Parish, under Juan de Bolas (also known as Lubolo). Toward the western end of Cockpit Country were the ‘Varmahaly or Karmahaly Negroes’ under the leadership of Juan de Serras. There were possibly a third group was active in the region of Porus, in modern Manchester Parish; and a fourth in the Blue Mountains.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655–1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 25–26. During the first decade of British rule, these groups were active on behalf of the Spanish. But, as it became increasingly obvious that the British would hold their conquest, the group run by de Bolas changed its position. Faced with discovery and defeat in 1659, de Bolas allied with the British and guided their troops on a raid which resulted in the final expulsion of the Spanish in 1660. In exchange, in 1663, Governor Lyttleton signed the first maroon treaty, granting de Bolas and his people land on the same terms as British settlers. The colonial authorities paid the men of de Bolas to hunt the supporters of de Serras and recent runaways.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490–1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), p. 113. However, de Bolas was eventually killed in an ambush, probably by maroons belonging to de Serras. While the maroons belonging to de Bolas disappeared from history, the English authorities failed to subdue the Karmahaly Maroons.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 14–25. The other maroon groups remained independent in the mountainous interior of Jamaica, surviving by subsistence farming and periodic raids of plantations. These initial maroon groups dwindled, migrating or merging with settlers. Others may have coalesced to form the nucleus of what would later be called the Windward Maroons. Over time, runaway slaves increased the maroon population, which eventually came to control large areas of the Jamaican mountainous interior. In the 1670s and 1680s, in his capacity as an owner of a large slave plantation, former buccaneer and now lieutenant-governor of Jamaica Sir Henry Morgan led three campaigns against the Karmahaly Maroons of de Serras. Morgan achieved some success against the Maroons, who withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, where they were able to stay out of the reach of Morgan and his forces. It is possible the Maroons of de Serras retreated into the Blue Mountains, where they merged with the Windward Maroons.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655–1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 23, 32–33. =Establishment of the Leeward and Windward Maroons= Between 1673 and 1690 there were several major slave uprisings, mainly prompted by newly arrived, highly-militarized Fante or Coromantee groups from Cape Coast and Ashanti Empire. On 31 July 1690, a rebellion involving 500 slaves from the Sutton estate in Clarendon Parish led to the formation of Jamaica’s most stable and best organized maroon group. Although some were killed, recaptured, or surrendered, more than 200, including women and children, remained free after the rebellion ended.Craton 1982, pp. 75–76 They established an Ashanti- style polity based in the western parts of the Cockpit Country, notably Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town); the most famous ruler of the Western Maroons was Cudjoe. They incorporated outsiders only after newcomers had satisfied a strict probationary period.Craton 1982, pp. 77–78 The leader of the Eastern Maroons when they agreed to peace was Quao.Philip Thicknesse, Memoirs and Anecdotes of Philip Thicknesse (Dublin: Craisberry and Campbell, 1790), pp. 56–77. The Windward Maroons, in the wilder parts of eastern Jamaica, were always composed of separate highly mobile and culturally heterogeneous groups.Craton 1982, pp. 78–81 It is possible that the runaway slaves from de Serras' group of Karmahaly Maroons formed the initial nucleus of the Windward Maroons.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 48–49. From early on, the Jamaican governors considered their settlements an impediment to British development of the interior. They ordered raids on the Maroon settlements in 1686 and 1702, to little effect.Craton 1982, pp. 78–79 By about 1720, a stronger Windward community had developed around the culturally Africanised group of three villages known as Nanny Town, under the spiritual leadership of Queen Nanny, an Ashanti woman, sometimes in allegiance and sometimes in competition with other Windward groups.Craton 1982, p. 81 She was known for her exceptional leadership skills, especially in guerrilla warfare during the First Maroon War. One tactic particular to the Jamaican Maroons involved the art of camouflage using plants. Her remains are reputedly buried at \\"Bump Grave\\" in Moore Town, the main town of the Windward Maroons, who are concentrated in and around the Rio Grande valley in the northeastern parish of Portland. Queen Nanny, also known as Granny Nanny (died c. 1750s), is the only woman honored as one of Jamaica's National Heroes. She has been immortalised in songs and legends. =First Maroon War 1728–1739= Disturbed by plantation raiding, the colonial authorities of Jamaica wanted to eradicate the maroon communities in order to promote British settlement. Their strategy, beginning in the 1730s, was to break off lines of communication between the Windward and Leeward Maroons, then first pick off the less organized Windward Maroons. In practice, the Maroon troops’ command of the territory and skill in guerrilla warfare gave them a strong advantage over colonial forces.Craton, Testing the Chains (1982), pp. 82–84. After much fighting, the British took and destroyed Nanny Town in 1734, but most of the Windward Maroons simply dispersed and formed new settlements.Craton 1982, p. 85 At this point, however, fighting shifted to Leeward, where the British troops had equally limited success against the well-trained and organized forces of Cudjoe.Craton 1982, p. 87 By the mid-1730s, warfare was proving costly to maroons and British alike and was turning into an ongoing stalemate. Cudjoe rejected suggestions of a treaty in 1734 and 1736, but by 1738 he agreed to parley with John Guthrie. This local planter and militia officer was known to and respected by the maroons.Craton 1982, pp. 87–88 In 1739, the treaty signed under British governor Edward Trelawny granted Cudjoe’s maroons 1500 acres of land between their strongholds of Trelawny Town and Accompong in the Cockpits and a certain amount of political autonomy and economic freedoms, in return for which the maroons were to provide military support in case of invasion or rebellion, and to return runaway slaves in exchange for a bounty of two dollars each. This last clause in the treaty caused tension between the maroons and the enslaved black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into maroon settlements.Craton 1982, pp. 88–90 In addition, a British superintendent was to be assigned to live in each maroon town. In 1740, similar treaties were signed by Quao and Nanny, major leaders of the Windward Maroons.Craton 1982, pp. 91–92 The Windward Maroons were originally located at Crawford's Town and the new Nanny Town (now called Moore Town). In all, about 600 maroons came to terms with the British authorities through these two treaties.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, p. 56. Not all the maroons accepted the treaties. Rebellions occurred in maroon communities in the years that followed. After the treaties, the white superintendents appointed by the governors eventually took control of the maroon towns.Barbara Kopytoff, \\"Jamaican Maroon Political Organization: the Effects of the Treaties\\", Social and Economic Studies, Vol. 25, No. 2 (1976), pp. 92–97. In the 1740s, some Leeward Maroons who opposed the 1739 treaty rose in revolt, but Cudjoe crushed those rebellions.Orlando Patterson, \\"Slavery and Slave Revolts: A Sociohistorical Analysis of the First Maroon War, 1665–1740\\", Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas, ed. by Richard Price (London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), p. 273. In 1754, Quao attempted to overthrow Edward Crawford, the new maroon leader of the Windward Maroon town, and in the resulting conflict, Crawford's Town was destroyed. Governor Charles Knowles re-established control over the uprising with the help of other maroons. He then ordered that the maroons of Crawford's Town be resettled in the new, nearby Windward Maroon towns of Charles Town (Jamaica) and Scott's Hall (Jamaica).Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, pp. 54–57. The maroon population grew from 664 in 1739 to 1,288 in 1796, at a time when both the slave population and the white settler communities were ravaged by disease. p. 240. =Intervention in Tacky's War, 1760= In April 1760, the Jamaican government called upon the maroons to honor their treaties and come to their assistance during the major slave uprising led by the Fante leader, Tacky. The Windward Maroons were first to be mobilized. Their intervention often appeared half-hearted: the Scott's Hall Maroons began by claiming outstanding arrears in bounty, while those of Down's Cove simply took cover when attacked by the rebels.Craton 1982, pp. 130–31 In the end, it was a Scott's Hall Maroon, Lieutenant Davy the Maroon, who killed Tacky during a skirmish. Although the loss of Tacky's leadership essentially ended the rebellion, by October related uprisings broke out on the leeward side of the island. Cudjoe's well-trained forces were also mobilized to help deal with them, apparently successfully.Craton 1982, pp. 135–36 In the years that followed the rebellion, many maroon officers such as Samuel Grant, allegedly the son of Davy, made a career out of hunting runaway slaves for the colonial authorities.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, pp. 75, 114. In the 18th century, maroons also hunted and killed notorious escaped slaves and their deputies, such as Ancoma, Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica), and Dagger. However, while they were successful in capturing and killing some runaways and their leaders, most members of the runaway communities continued to thrive under new leaders.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, pp. 109–17. White superintendents took command of the maroon towns, and the maroon officers were relegated to their subordinates. After Tacky's War, the governor appointed a separate superintendent for each of the five maroon towns. These superintendents reported to the Superintendent-General, who in turn reported to the governor. The Superintendents-General of all maroon towns were as follows: *1770–c. 1772 William Ross *1772–c. 1779 Robert Brereton *c. 1779 John Fergusson *1779–1792/3 John JamesSivapragasam, After the Treaties, p. 278. =Second Maroon War 1795–1796= The Second Maroon War began in 1795 against the background of the British-Jamaican planters panicked by the excesses of the French Revolution, and by the corresponding start of a slave revolt in neighboring Saint-Domingue, which ended with the independence of Haiti in 1804. At the same time, an increasing hunger for land among expanding maroon communities in Jamaica coincided with several more immediate and proximate causes of grievance among the maroons of Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town).Craton 1982, pp. 211–14 The treaties following the First Maroon War had called for the assignment of a white \\"superintendent\\" in each maroon community. Trelawny Town had objected to the official recently assigned to them and eventually expelled him.Craton 1982, p. 214 At this, the new, hardline Governor, Balcarres, sent William Fitch to march on Trelawny Town with a military force to demand their immediate submission. Balcarres ignored the advice of local planters, who suggested giving the maroons some more land in order to avoid conflict. Instead, the governor demanded that the maroons surrender unconditionally, provoking a conflict that could have been avoided.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655–1796, pp. 209–49. The Trelawny Maroons, led by their colonel, Montague James, chose to fight and were initially successful, fighting a guerrilla war in small bands under several captains, of whom the most noted were Johnson, Parkinson, and Palmer.Craton 1982, pp. 215, 217–19 The casualties suffered by Fitch and his men were significantly higher than those felt by the maroons of Trelawny Town.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 209–49. When the Trelawny Town Maroons killed Fitch, several of his officers, some Accompong Maroon trackers, and many militia soldiers in an ambush, Balcarres appointed a new general, George Walpole. This new general suffered more setbacks, until he eventually opted to besiege the Cockpit Country on a massive scale, surrounding it with watchposts, firing in shells from a long distance, and intending to destroy or cut off all maroon provision grounds.Craton 1982, p. 219 Meanwhile, maroon attempts to recruit plantation slaves met with a mixed response, though large numbers of runaway slaves gained their freedom by fighting for Trelawny Town.Michael Sivapragasam (2019) \\"The Second Maroon War: Runaway Slaves fighting on the side of Trelawny Town\\", Slavery & Abolition, Retrieved 10 September 2019.Craton, Testing the Chains (1982), p. 218. Other maroon communities maintained neutrality, but Accompong Town, however, fought on the side of the colonial militias against Trelawny Town.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655–1796, p. 220. Despite signs that the siege was working, Balcarres grew impatient and sent to Cuba for a hundred hunting dogs and handlers. The reputation of these was so fearsome that their arrival quickly prompted the surrender of the majority of Trelawny forces.Craton 1982, pp. 220–21 The maroons, however, only put down their arms on condition that they would not be deported, and Walpole gave his word that would be the case. To Walpole's dismay, Balcarres refused to treat with the defeated maroons and had them deported from Jamaica, at first to Nova Scotia, then to the new British colony of Sierra Leone, and joined the African- American founders who established the Colony of Sierra Leone and the settlement of Freetown, Sierra Leone.Craton 1982, pp. 222–23Grant, John. Black Nova Scotians. Halifax: The Nova Scotia Museum, 1980. From the 1830s on some maroons (or their descendants) returned to Jamaica to work as free labourers, and many of them settled in the village of Flagstaff, near the old site of Trelawny Town (although some of these returnees resettled in Sierra Leone)Fortin (2006), p. 23. (see Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone). The descendants of the Returned Maroons live in Flagstaff today (see Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)). Those who remained in Sierra Leone formed the new Creole ethnic group of Sierra Leone which established diaspora communities along the West African shores from Sierra Leone to the Gambia to Fernando Pó.Baron, Robert & Cara, Ana C. Creolization as Cultural Creativity. p. 152. =Maroons in the 19th century= Trelawny Town was the largest maroon town, so the population of maroons in Jamaica was significantly dented by their deportation. However, in the nineteenth century the total population of the four remaining maroon towns grew from 853 in 1808 to 1,563 in 1841. p. 243. The maroon towns grew in numbers at a time when the population of black slaves and white slave-holders alike declined from disease. One historian argues that this is due to the healthier environment of the maroon towns. pp. 238–46. When the colonial authorities deported the maroons of Trelawny Town, they left a void which was filled by communities of runaway slaves. The maroons of the smaller town of Accompong were unable to cope with the growing numbers of runaways in western Jamaica, who found refuge in the Cockpit Country. The Accompong Maroons tried but failed in their attempts to disperse the runaway community of Cuffee (Jamaica), who established a community of runaway slaves in the Cockpit Country in 1798.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, pp. 182–90. When Cuffee's group faded from the colonial records, their place was taken by another group of runaways, who established themselves in the Cockpit Country in 1812. The community of Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come also resisted attempts by the Accompong Maroons and the colonial militias to disperse them in the 1820s.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, pp. 191–93. A large group of runaway slaves established themselves near Hellshire Beach in southern Jamaica, and it thrived there for years until it was finally dispersed by a party of Windward Maroons in 1819.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, p. 196. The maroons played a significant role in helping the colonial authorities to suppress the Samuel Sharpe revolt in 1831–32, under the leadership of white superintendents such as Alexander Fyfe (Fyffe).Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, pp. 201–03, 277. Sharpe's Baptist War persuaded the British government to end the system of slavery, which they did in the years following the rebellion. After that, the colonial authorities had no use for the maroons, and they passed the Maroon Allotments Act in 1842, and abolished the post of superintendent in the 1850s. Their attempts to break up the maroon communal land, while partially successful in Charles Town and Scott's Hall, met with maroon resistance in Accompong Town and Moore Town.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties, pp. 254–55.Carey, The Maroon Story, p. 560. In 1865, poor free blacks, led by Paul Bogle, rose in revolt against the colonial authorities in the Morant Bay Rebellion. The governor called out the Moore Town Maroons one last time to put down the rebellion. Fyfe was called up once more to lead a combination of Moore Town Maroons, including some who resided in Hayfield and Bath, and they committed a number of atrocities before they captured Bogle. However, their cruelty in suppressing the uprising attracted a lot of criticism from Methodist missionaries and residents of Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1994), pp. 131–36. Maroons in the 21st century Hon. Colonel Ferron Williams, Colonel-in-Chief and elected leader of Accompong To this day, the maroons in Jamaica are, to a small extent, autonomous and separate from Jamaican culture. Those of Accompong have preserved their land since 1739. The isolation used to their advantage by their ancestors has today resulted in their communities being amongst the most inaccessible on the island. Today, the four official maroon towns still in existence in Jamaica are Accompong Town, Moore Town, Charles Town and Scott's Hall. They hold lands allotted to them in the 1739–1740 treaties with the British.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490–1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997). These maroons still maintain their traditional celebrations and practices, some of which have West African origin. For example, the council of a maroon settlement is called an Asofo,Sangster, Ian, Jamaica: A Benn Holiday Guide. 1973. from the Twi Akan word asafo (assembly, church, society).Anyamesɛm Anaa Twerɛ Kronkron Akan Kasa Mu (The Bible in Twi: Asante), The Bible Society of Ghana, Accra, 1964.Rottmann, W. J., compiler, Kristo Asafo Abakọsẹm Tẇi Kasa Mu (Church History in Tshi), Basel: Basel Evangelical Missionary Society, 1913. Native Jamaicans and island tourists are allowed to attend many of these events. Others considered sacred are held in secret and shrouded in mystery. Singing, dancing, drum-playing, and preparation of traditional foods form a central part of most gatherings.A History of the Maroons of Jamaica , Farin Voice. In their largest town, Accompong, in the parish of St. Elizabeth, the Leeward Maroons have a vibrant community of about 600. Tours of the village are offered to foreigners. They hold a large festival annually on 6 January to commemorate the signing of the peace treaty with the British after the First Maroon War.Campbell, Mavis Christine (1988), The Maroons of Jamaica, 1655–1796: A History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal, Granby, MA: Bergin & Garvey.Edwards, Bryan (1796), \\"Observations on the disposition, character, manners, and habits of life, of the Maroon negroes of the island of Jamaica; and a detail of the origin, progress, and termination of the late war between those people and the white inhabitants\\", in Edwards, Bryan (1801), Historical Survey of the Island of Saint Domingo, London: J. Stockdale, pp. 303–60. Moore Town, located between the Blue Mountains and John Crow Mountains in Portland Parish, was relisted on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008 for its maroon heritage, particularly music.

The Temple was identified as such by Pausanias but the ruins present today indicate a complex history. Ares had a temple somewhat like Athena's. The foundations are of early Greece construction and date, but fragments of the superstructure, now located at the western end of the temple, can be dated to the 5th century BC. From the fragments archaeologists are confident that they belonged to a Doric peripteral temple of a similar size, plan and date to the Temple of Hephaestus. Marks on the remaining stones indicate that the temple may have originally stood elsewhere and was dismantled, moved and reconstructed on the Roman base - a practice common during the Roman occupation of Greece. The temple probably came from the sanctuary of Athena Pallenis at modern Stavro, where foundations have been found but no temple remains are present. Pausanias described the sanctuary in the 1st century: > [At Athens] is a sanctuary of Ares, where are placed two images of > Aphrodite, one of Ares made by Alkamenes, and one of Athena made by a Parian > of the name of Lokros. There is also an image of Enyo, made by the sons of > Praxiteles. About the temple stand images of Herakles, Theseus, Apollo > binding his hair with a fillet, and statues of Kalades, who it is said > framed laws for the Athenians, and of Pindaros, the statue being one of the > rewards the Athenians gave him for praising them in an ode.Pausanias, > Description of Greece 1. 8. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.) However, as the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity as the official religion of the empire, in the late third and early fourth centuries, probably under the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire by Emperor Theodosius I, the temple of Ares was destroyed and looted.

Sr. Joan professed religious vows as a member of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Louis, Missouri in 1965. In 1970 she received a bachelor's degree and in 1974 a master's degree in English literature from the College of St. Rose in Albany. She earned a doctorate in 1981 from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Lescinski started her teaching career at an inner- city Catholic high school in Utica, New York. She has taught at the college level since 1972. From 1979 to 1991, she worked as a professor of English at the College of St. Rose; from 1991 to 1993 she served as associate dean, academic affairs and professor of English at Avila University in Kansas City, Missouri; and from 1993 to 1998 she served as vice president of academic affairs, dean and professor of English at Fontbonne University in St. Louis, Missouri. She became president and professor of English at St. Mary-of-the- Woods College, serving from 1998 to 2007. St. Mary-of-the-Woods College, \\"The Woods,\\" is the oldest Catholic liberal arts women's college in the United States. Lescinski led SMWC to record gains in enrollment, facilitated the development of institutional strategic and master plans, and introduced several undergraduate and two new graduate academic programs. SMWC invested $10 million in campus facilities and had a significant increase in its number of donors. Lescinski led the most ambitious capital campaign in SMWC's history, with $25 million raised, exceeding their campaign goal by 20 percent. In 2007, Lescinski became the first nun and first female president of St. Ambrose University (SAU) in Davenport, Iowa. Under her leadership, the university has expanded on and beyond the main campus. In 2009, ground was broken for the Center for Health Sciences Education building on the Genesis Medical Center West Central Park campus, with an addition built in 2014. Also in 2009, SAU established its presence in downtown Davenport at the DavenportOne New Ventures Center, where students take graduate and professional development courses. The following year in 2010, the university purchased the residence building and property of the Diocese of Davenport, while the Diocese was in bankruptcy. The land is being developed in partnership with the adjacent Assumption High School for an athletic complex. Anticipated for completion in Fall 2017 is a new Wellness and Recreation Center on the main campus in the location of the former Timmerman Field. This will mark the conclusion of the largest single capital project in the University's history. During Lescinski's tenure, several degree programs have been added or expanded at the undergraduate and graduate levels: Mechanical Engineering (2011); Master of Physician Assistant Studies (2014); Master of Early Childhood Education (2015); Healthcare and Business Sales (2016); and Doctor of Occupational Therapy (2016).

It was released by Virgin Sound and Design in 1994. The game centers around a green bookworm named Wiggins and features voice acting by Doug Preis, Joseph Siravo, Eden Rigal, Richmond Hoxie, Polly Adams, and Daniel Rysnyder. Gameplay Wiggins in Storyland features little actual gameplay. Players can write stories and poems using a wide assortment of animated backgrounds, animated characters, props, and background music. The game was designed to allow children to freely write stories without being boggled by more complicated tools such as Microsoft Word. The game included over 40 characters (Including Wiggins, the main worm, Jenkins, the ghost, and the honker), 110 props, eight different story themes, multiple type fonts, and 40 different sound effects and background music. In short, the player is presented with a book taking up mostly the entire screen, wherein the leftmost page could be written on whilst the rightmost was left empty. A toolbar at the top of the screen allowed the player to drag props and such onto the rightmost page to help illustrate the story. The player may manipulate the animated characters in various ways—such as changing their size, facial expression, and mood. Other than that, the player can even record their story and hear it played back aloud. In addition to the story-writing section, the player may enter \\"Wiggins' Library\\", a point-and-click activity room. Activities within the library include painting the room, playing musical instruments, shooting peas with a spoon, and making fruit juices for Wiggins to drink.

Early years As a junior in 2005 at Moore Catholic High School in Staten Island (N.Y.), he caught 39 passes for 784 yards (20.1 avg.) with 17 TDs, ran for 240 yards with 4 scores and posted 38 tackles, 3 sacks and 2 interceptions for TDs. He eventually transferred to Hargrave Military Academy his senior year, where he had 41 receptions for 942 yards (23.0 avg.) with 13 TDs in 2005. Hazelton was invited to play in the 2006 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, a national all-star game for the best high school football players in the country. Collegiate career =USC= Hazelton arrived at USC as one of the nation's best players and one of USC's biggest pickups of the recruiting season. Hazelton saw time in only two games his freshman season, as the Trojans ended up going 11–2 and winning the 2007 Rose Bowl against Michigan 32–18. Hazelton played backup to Dwayne Jarrett and Steve Smith, two of the best receivers in the nation, and only accumulated one catch for eight yards. He also had a run for seven yards.

Hazelton's 2008 season with USC was not as successful. After catching five passes, he suffered a high ankle sprain in the season opener against Virginia. Once he recovered he found himself unable to climb back into the starting line-up. The arrival and rise of Arkansas- transfer Damian Williams, along with continued production by senior Patrick Turner and sophomore Ronald Johnson, pushed Hazelton into the role of a seldom used reserve. Further complicating matters, Hazelton's grandfather was diagnosed with cancer, and he desired to be geographically closer to him. On December 2, 2008, Hazelton asked for and was granted permission to transfer to another school. After leaving, Hazelton noted \\"USC is a great place. It's filled up with athletes.

She served for fourteen years as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester Wythenshawe. Family Hill was born to a rising middle-class family in Manchester, where her parents, Richard and Mary Ridyard, ran a catering business. They were not wealthy enough to send her to public school, and on leaving state secondary school in Manchester, she joined the family business. In 1922 she married John Stanley Hill, and as usual for married women in those times, gave up work to look after the home. They had a son, John, and two daughters, Betty and Faye. John married Joyce Lee and had two children John and Caroline. Caroline has three children Jennifer, Christopher and Daniel. Betty went on to have two children Alex Angus and Richard William Smith who married Anne Hinds in 1986 and had 3 children Benjamin, Hannah and Joshua. Community activities On the death of her father, Hill and her brother took joint control of the family firm. She also became involved in the Conservative Party and in 1936 was elected to Manchester City Council from Didsbury ward. On the council she specialised in health issues, and was chair of the Health Committee and of the South Manchester Hospital Management Committee. In addition to her council work she was County Borough organiser for the Women's Voluntary Service (WVS) for Manchester from 1943, and a Justice of the Peace from 1945. She chaired the local Poppy Fund. She was widowed in 1947. Parliament At the 1950 general election, Hill was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Manchester Wythenshawe, a newly created constituency at the southern end of Manchester which included her ward. Her maiden speech was on the subject of housebuilding, which she urged be maintained in order to prevent illnesses associated with poor housing. Women's issues In November 1950 Hill won a spot in the ballot for Private Member's Bills, and introduced the Deserted Wives Bill which proposed to allow courts to award tenancy of a house and ownership of the chattels within it to a wife who had been deserted by her husband. However, she was unable to find the votes to force a vote on its merits and the Bill fell. In 1952 Hill, together with three other backbench women Conservative MPs, wrote to The Times to urge Conservative Associations to adopt more women candidates.The Times, 7 March 1952. Hill broke the Conservative whip to oppose changes in the Manchester constituency boundaries in 1954, and found herself in a slightly less favourable position at the 1955 general election; she was re-elected by 2,822 votes. She became chairman of the Conservative backbench committee on Health and Social Security, and in 1958 supported government proposals to increase National Health Service charges, arguing that people who made contributions were putting something away for a rainy day in the traditional manner. Rebelliousness In 1961 Hill supported the reintroduction of corporal punishment. She also rebelled the next year over a Bill setting up a training council for Health visitors, to increase the council's power to make grants. Reacting to the 1963 budget, she hoped that husbands would pass on to their wives some of their allowances which had been increased. She also joined the rebellion over the abolition of resale price maintenance in 1964. Defeat Having held a marginal seat for two elections, Hill's position was made more difficult by the growth of council housing in the constituency in the early 1960s. At the 1964 general election, she was defeated by a wide margin of 4,777 votes. Hill had retained her seat on Manchester City Council throughout her time in Parliament, but retired in 1966; the Council appointed her as an honorary Alderman in honour of her years of service.

He died in Florence. His paintings have the porcelain crispness of design, characteristic of Carlo Dolci; and some the sensuality of a Francesco Furini. He painted a San Giovanni Gualberto in prayer for the Chapel of the saint in the Vallombrosa Abbey.Vallombrosa abbey.

The clinic system is a major provider of healthcare for NASA and a center for healthcare research.  History  The formation of starting 1949 by Dr. Mavis P. Kelsey with the purpose of combining primary and specialty medical services in one location in the city of Houston. This was a popular concept of the day based on the Mayo Clinic model. These types of clinics bring specialists, primary care physicians, nurses and other care givers together as a team to provide the best possible[according to whom?] care. In 1949, Dr. Kelsey, an internal medicine specialist, leased space in the Hermann Professional Building and set up his practice. Over the next two years, he would welcome two of his Mayo friends, Dr. William D. Seybold, a surgeon, and Dr. William V. Leary, another internist, to the practice. Dr. Kelsey's brother, John R. Kelsey, Jr., another Mayo-trained physician and specialist in gastroenterology, joined the practice in 1953. Also joining the multi- specialty team in the 1950s were a psychiatrist, cardiologist and rheumatologist. In 1953, Clinic doctors began serving rotations at area hospitals, including Hermann Hospital, Baylor University Medical College (now Baylor College of Medicine), and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. On December 15, 1956, the Kelsey and Leary Foundation for the Advancement of Medicine was established to provide scholarships and financial support for research. The Kelsey Foundation, as it is known today, is involved in a variety of research projects with universities, pharmaceutical companies, government bodies and hospitals in the Texas Medical Center. Research areas include cancer, epilepsy, cardiology, diabetes and obstetrics. During the 1960s, the Clinic added more specialists and more departments. The rapidly expanding Radiology Department added lab technicians, while the multi-specialty team continued to grow with the addition of a pediatrician and otolaryngologist (Ear, Nose & Throat specialist). New departments included Pediatrics, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Urology, Ophthalmology and Dentistry. In 1964, the Clinic moved into new facilities at 6624 Fannin. That building is now the St. Luke's Medical Tower. Dr. Leary joined the staff of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 1965 and the Clinic's name was changed to Kelsey-Seybold Clinic. For over half a century, the Kelsey-Seybold name has been synonymous with multi-specialty healthcare in Houston. In 2020, Kelsey-Seybold Clinic relationship with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas was renewed.  Affiliation with NASA  In 1966, the Clinic became the first contract medical service provider for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Dr. Stanton P. Fischer, a pulmonologist, joined the staff a year earlier and assisted in providing executive physical examinations on NASA employees and other contractors. Throughout the clinic's long association with NASA, they have contributed medical support services to the Apollo, Skylab, Apollo-Soyuz and Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS). Concerning the ISS, Kelsey-Seybold has provided a NASA Support Physician in Moscow since the inception of the International Space Station. Dr. Jose F. Flores has served in that capacity since 1998. Additionally, Dr. Flores provides medical support at all Soyuz launches in Baikonur, Kazakhstan involving American astronauts and has also provided medical support at certain Soyuz landings. Flores attended the launch of Zarya, the first unmanned module launched by Russia in 1998 and has attended every manned Soyuz launch with an American astronaut on board to the present day. Kelsey-Seybold also provides contract medical services in six locations in the U.S.  Patients served  Among the many patients who came to Kelsey-Seybold Clinic in the late 60s and 70s were entertainers like Roy Rogers and international patients from Saudi Arabia, India and Africa. More Latin Americans visited Kelsey-Seybold Clinic than any other U.S. clinic during this period. In 1971, KSC opened its first neighborhood health center on Post Oak in the Uptown District of Houston. The success of that health center resulted in other locations being operated in downtown Houston, Sugar Land, The Woodlands and by Intercontinental Airport. Today, Kelsey-Seybold Clinic operates more than 20 neighborhood health centers in the Houston area.  Current administrators and expansion  In 1978, Dr. James C. Hoyle joined the staff of Pediatrics. Dr. Hoyle is the current Medical Director, Clinical Operations. In 1980, Dr. Spencer R. Berthelsen, an internist and current Chairman of the Board joined the group. Dr. William Seybold retired in 1979 and Dr. Mavis Kelsey retired in 1986. The Clinic they founded continued to increase its presence in the Houston service sector. In 1999, Kelsey-Seybold Clinic moved into the current Main Campus at 2727 West Holcombe Blvd. The Main Campus building provides primary and specialty care in a single location, an outpatient surgery center, and an urgent care center.

At the time many employees of the central office lived in communities such as the Texas Medical Center area, Fort Bend County, and Clear Lake. The headquarters had a cost of $36 million, including the costs for equipment, construction, and fees. Construction began in May 2012. The construction was scheduled to be completed in June 2013.

Race is a complex concept that changes across chronological eras and that depends on both self-identification and social recognition. In the study of race and health, scientists organize people in racial categories depending on different factors such as: phenotype, ancestry, social identity, genetic makeup and lived experience. “Race” and ethnicity often remain undifferentiated in health research. Differences in health status, health outcomes, life expectancy, and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups are well documented. Some individuals in certain racial groups receive less care, have less access to resources, and live shorter lives in general. Epidemiological data indicates that racial groups are unequally affected by diseases, in terms or morbidity and mortality. These health differences between racial groups create racial health disparities. Health disparities are defined as “preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations”. Health disparities are intrinsically related to the “historical and current unequal distribution of social, political, economic and environmental resources\\". Social, political, economic, environmental, cultural and biological factors constitute determinants of health.World Health Organization. The determinants of health. Geneva. Accessed 12 May 2011 (which are inter-related with all three, but mostly social factors). The relation between race and health has been studied from a multidisciplinary perspective, paying attention to how racism influence health disparities and how environmental factors and physiological factors respond to each other and to genetics.  Racial health disparities  Health disparities refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial and ethnic groups.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Healthy People 2010: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000). The US Health Resources and Services Administration defines health disparities as \\"population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care\\". Health is measured through variables such as life expectancy and incidence of diseases. How researchers view race is often linked to how racial disparities are addressed because the national administrator of health uses these research findings to implement policies. In the U.S., minority populations suffer disproportionately from chronic diseases, but are under-represented in nursing and medical professions. Hispanics and African Americans had the greatest prevalence of diabetes, while non-Hispanic blacks had higher odds of having heart disease with cancer or chronic lung disease than non-Hispanic whites. However, while African Americans represent about 13.4% of the U.S. population (U.S. Census, 2018) they make up of only about 11.6% of the healthcare workforce. Other minority groups such as Latinos and Asians make up about 16.1% and 5.3% of the healthcare workforce respectively. This article identifies the benefits of minority representation in medicine, trends in admissions, and ways to increase minority representation. =Difference between health inequity and health disparities= Although individuals from different environmental, continental, socioeconomic, and racial groups etc. have different levels of health, yet not all of these differences are always categorized or defined as health disparities. Some researchers separate definitions of health inequality from health disparity by preventability. Health inequalities are often categorized as being unavoidable i.e. due to age, while preventable unfair health outcomes are categorized as health inequities. These are seen as preventable because they are usually associated with income, education, race, ethnicity, gender, and more.  Defining race  Definitions of race are ambiguous due to the various paradigms used to discuss race. These definitions are a direct result of biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race. Due to its ambiguity, terms such as race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race. Some researchers critique this interchangeability noting that the conceptual differences between race and ethnicity are not widely agreed upon. Biological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe \\"races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, a.k.a. use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences\\". As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that \\"race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary\\". Despite Essentialism and anti-Essentialism views, modern scientific evidence suggests there are more genetic differences within individuals belonging to the same racial groups, than between individuals belonging to different racial groups. In the last 20 years there has been major criticisms on the once widely held view that race is biological. In response to these criticisms, researchers and social scientists have begun examining notions of race as constructed. Racial groups are \\"constructed\\" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future. Since race is changing and often so loosely characterized on arbitrary phenotypes, and because it has no genetic basis, the only working definition we can assign it is a social construct. This is not to say race is imaginary or non-existent, it is very real and plays a role in our society; however to say that the concept of race has any scientific merit or has a scientific foundation can lead to many issues in scientific research, and it may also lead to inherent racial bias. Social views also better explain the ambiguity of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.Social interpretations of race Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories. The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment. Race and disease Diseases affect racial groups differently, especially when they are co-related with class disparities. As socioeconomic factors influence the access to care,Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. the barriers to access healthcare systems can perpetuate different biological effects of diseases among racial groups that are not pre-determined by biology. Some researchers advocate for the use of self-reported race as a way to trace socioeconomic disparities and its effects in health. For instance, a study conducted by the National Health Service checks program in the United Kingdom, which aims to increase diagnosis across demographics, noted that \\"the reported lower screening in specific black and minority ethnic communities... may increase inequalities in health.\\" In this specific case, the lack of attention to certain demographics can be seen as a cause of increased instances of disease from this lack of proper, equal preventative care. One must consider these external factors when evaluating statistics on the prevalence of disease in populations, even though genetic components can play a role in predispositions to contracting some illnesses. Individuals who share a similar genetic makeup can also share certain propensity or resistance to specific diseases. However, there are confronted positions in relation to the utility of using 'races' to talk about populations sharing a similar genetic makeup. Some geneticists argued that human variation is geographically structured and that genetic differences correlate with general conceptualizations of racial groups. Others claimed that this correlation is too unstable and that the genetic differences are minimal and they are \\"distributed over the world in a discordant manner”. Therefore, race is regarded by some as a useful tool for the assessment of genetic epidemiological risk, while others consider it can lead to an increased underdiagnosis in 'low risk' populations. =Single-gene disorders= There are many autosomal recessive single gene genetic disorders that differ in frequency between different populations due to the region and ancestry as well as the founder effect. Some examples of these disorders include: *Cystic fibrosis, the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease among people of Northern European heritage *Sickle-cell anemia, most prevalent in populations with sub-Saharan African ancestry but also common among Latin- American, Middle Eastern populations, as well as those people of South European regions such as Turkey, Greece, and ItalyBloom, Miriam. Understanding Sickle Cell Disease. University Press of Mississippi, 1995. Chapter 2. *Thalassemia, most prevalent in populations having Mediterranean ancestry, to the point that the disease's name is derived from Greek thalasson, \\"sea\\" *Tay–Sachs disease, an autosomal recessive disorder most common among Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, Cajuns of Louisiana and Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania *Hereditary hemochromatosis, most common among persons having Northern European ancestry, in particular those people of Celtic descent *Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome, most common among Puerto Ricans *Finnish heritage diseases, autosomal recessive diseases that are far more common among Finns *Many disorders that are much more common in Ashkenazi Jews =Multifactorial polygenic diseases= Many diseases differ in frequency between different populations. However, complex diseases are affected by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. There is controversy over the extent to which some of these conditions are influenced by genes, and ongoing research aims to identify which genetic loci, if any, are linked to these diseases. \\"Risk is the probability that an event will occur. In epidemiology, it is most often used to express the probability that a particular outcome will occur following a particular exposure.\\" Different populations are considered \\"high-risk\\" or \\"low-risk\\" groups for various diseases due to the probability of that particular population being more exposed to certain risk factors. Beyond genetic factors, history and culture, as well as current environmental and social conditions, influence a certain populations' risk for specific diseases. =Disease progression= Racial groups may differ in how a disease progresses. Different access to healthcare services, different living and working conditions influence how a disease progresses within racial groups. However, the reasons for these differences are multiple, and should not be understood a consequence of genetic differences between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors affecting. =Prevention= Genetics have been proven to be a strong predictor for common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric illnesses. Some geneticists have determined that \\"human genetic variation is geographically structured\\" and that different geographic regions correlate with different races. Meanwhile, others have claimed that the human genome is characterized by clinal changes across the globe, in relation with the \\"Out of Africa\\" theory and how migration to new environments cause changes in populations' genetics over time. Some diseases are more prevalent in some populations identified as races due to their common ancestry. Thus, people of African and Mediterranean descent are found to be more susceptible to sickle-cell disease while cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are more common among European populations. Some physicians claim that race can be used as a proxy for the risk that the patient may be exposed to in relation to these diseases. However, racial self- identification only provides fragmentary information about the persons ancestry. Thus, racial profiling in medical services would also lead to the risk of underdiagnosis. While genetics certainly play a role in determining how susceptible a person is to specific diseases, environmental, structural and cultural factors play a large role as well. For this reason, it is impossible to discern exactly what causes a person to acquire a disease, but it is important to observe how all these factors relate to each other. Each person's health is unique, as they have different genetic compositions and life histories. =Race-based treatment= Racial groups, especially when defined as minorities or ethnic groups, often face structural, cultural and linguistic barriers to access healthcare services. The development of culturally and structurally competent services and research that meet the specific health care needs of racial groups is still in its infancy. In the United States, the Office of Minority Health The NIH (National institutes of health) and The WHO are organizations that provide useful links and support research that is targeted at the development of initiatives around minority communities and the health disparities they face. Similarly, In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service established a specialist collection on Ethnicity & Health. This resource was supported by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the UK NHS Evidence initiative NHS Evidence.NHS Evidence Similarly, there are growing numbers of resource and research centers which are seeking to provide this service for other national settings, such as Multicultural Mental Health Australia. However, cultural competence has also been criticized for having the potential to create stereotypes. Scientific studies have shown the lack of efficacy of adapting pharmaceutical treatment to racial categories. \\"Race-based medicine\\" is the term for medicines that are targeted at specific racial clusters which are shown to have a propensity for a certain disorder. The first example of this in the U.S. was when BiDil, a medication for congestive heart failure, was licensed specifically for use in American patients that self-identify as black. Previous studies had shown that African American patients with congestive heart failure generally respond less effectively to traditional treatments than white patients with similar conditions. After two trials, BiDil was licensed exclusively for use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely that it was more effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme. Critics are concerned that the trend of research on race-specific pharmaceutical treatments will result in inequitable access to pharmaceutical innovation and smaller minority groups may be ignored. This has led to a call for regulatory approaches to be put in place to ensure scientific validity of racial disparity in pharmacological treatment. An alternative to \\"race-based medicine\\" is personalized or precision medicine. Precision medicine is a medical model that proposes the customization of healthcare, with medical decisions, treatments, practices, or products being tailored to the individual patient. It involves identifying genetic, genomic (i.e., genomic sequencing), and clinical information—as opposed to using race as a proxy for these data—to better predict a patient's predisposition to certain diseases. Environmental factors A positive correlation between minorities and a socioeconomic status of being low-income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low-income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in health. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low-income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San Diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone to obesity, which can lead to diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes. Furthermore, this can also occur when minorities living in rural areas undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students who participated in this study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life. Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food. Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet; this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from Cyprus, a country east of the Mediterranean Sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence. It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food. Genetic factors The fact that every human has a unique genetic code is the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting. Versions of a trait, known as alleles, occur at different frequencies in different human populations; populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more. A phenotype is the \\"outward, physical manifestation\\" of an organism.\\" For humans, phenotypic differences are most readily seen via skin color, eye color, hair color, or height; however, any observable structure, function, or behavior can be considered part of a phenotype. A genotype is the \\"internally coded, inheritable information\\" carried by all living organisms. The human genome is encoded in DNA. For any trait of interest, observed differences among individuals \\"may be due to differences in the genes\\" coding for a trait or \\"the result of variation in environmental condition\\". This variability is due to gene-environment interactions that influence genetic expression patterns and trait heritability. For humans, there is \\"more genetic variation among individual people than between larger racial groups\\". In general, an average of 80% of genetic variation exists within local populations, around 10% is between local populations within the same continent, and approximately 8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents. Studies have found evidence of genetic differences between populations, but the distribution of genetic variants within and among human populations is impossible to describe succinctly because of the difficulty of defining a \\"population\\", the clinal nature of variation, and heterogeneity across the genome. Thus, the racialization of science and medicine can lead to controversy when the term population and race are used interchangeably. =Evolutionary factors= Malaria-endemic countries eastern hemisphere Malaria-endemic countries western hemisphere Genes may be under strong selection in response to local diseases. For example, people who are duffy negative tend to have higher resistance to malaria. Most Africans are duffy negative and most non-Africans are duffy positive. A number of genetic diseases more prevalent in malaria-afflicted areas may provide some genetic resistance to malaria including sickle cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and possibly others. Many theories about the origin of the cystic fibrosis have suggested that it provides a heterozygote advantage by giving resistance to diseases earlier common in Europe. In earlier research, a common theory was the \\"common disease-common variant\\" model. It argues that for common illnesses, the genetic contribution comes from the additive or multiplicative effects of gene variants that each one is common in the population. Each such gene variant is argued to cause only a small risk of disease and no single variant is enough to cause the disease. An individual must have many of these common gene variants in order for the risk of disease to be substantial. More recent research indicates that the \\"common disease-rare variant\\" may be a better explanation for many common diseases. In this model, rare but higher-risk gene variants cause common diseases. This model may be relevant for diseases that reduces fertility. In contrast, for common genes associated with common disease to persist they must either have little effect during the reproductive period of life (like Alzheimer's disease) or provide some advantage in the original environment (like genes causing autoimmune diseases also providing resistance against infections). In either case varying frequencies of genes variants in different populations may be an explanation for health disparities. Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, deep venous thrombosis, Crohn disease, and type 2 diabetes appear to adhere to \\"common disease-common variant\\" model. =Gene flow= Gene flow and admixture can also have an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders. Multiple sclerosis, for example, is typically associated with people of European descent, but due to admixture African Americans have elevated levels of the disorder relative to Africans. Some diseases and physiological variables vary depending upon their admixture ratios. Examples include measures of insulin functioning and obesity. = Gene interactions = The same gene variant, or group of gene variants, may produce different effects in different populations depending on differences in the gene variants, or groups of gene variants, they interact with. One example is the rate of progression to AIDS and death in HIV-infected patients. In Caucasians and Hispanics, HHC haplotypes were associated with disease retardation, particularly a delayed progression to death, while for African Americans, possession of HHC haplotypes was associated with disease acceleration. In contrast, while the disease-retarding effects of the CCR2-641 allele were found in African Americans, they were not found in Caucasians.  Theoretical approaches in addressing health and race disparities  Public health researchers and policy makers are working to reduce health disparities. Health effects of racism are now a major area of research. In fact, these seem to be the primary research focus in biological and social sciences. Interdisciplinary methods have been used to address how race affects health. according to published studies, many factors combine together to affect the health of individuals and communities. Whether people are healthy or not, is determined by their circumstances and environment. Factors that need to be addressed when looking at health and race: income and social status, education, physical environment, social support networks, genetics, health services and gender. These determinants are often cited in public health, anthropology, and other social science disciplines. The WHO categorizes these determinants into three broader topics: the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors. Due to the diversity of factors that often attribute to health disparities outcomes, interdisciplinary approaches are often implemented. Interdisciplinarity or interdisciplinary studies involves the combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity (e.g., a research project) The term interdisciplinary is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study. Interdisciplinarity involves researchers, students, and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought, professions, or technologies—along with their specific perspectives—in the pursuit of a common task. =Biocultural approach= Biocultural evolution was introduced and first used in the 1970s. Biocultural methods focus on the interactions between humans and their environment to understand human biological adaptation and variation. These studies: “research on questions of human biology and medical ecology that specifically includes social, cultural, or behavioral variables in the research design, offer valuable models for studying the interface between biological and cultural factors affecting human well-being” This approach is useful in generating holistic viewpoints on human biological variation. There are two biocultural approach models. The first approach fuses biological, environmental, and cultural data. The second approach treats biological data as primary data and culture and environmental data as secondary. The salt sensitivity hypothesis is an example of implementing biocultural approaches in order to understand cardiovascular health disparities among African American populations. This theory, founded by Wilson and Grim, stems from the disproportional rates of salt sensitive high blood pressure seen between U.S. African American and White populations and between U.S. African American and West Africans as well. The researchers hypothesized that the patterns were in response to two events. One the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which resulted in massive death totals of Africans who were forced over, those who survived and made to the United States were more likely able to withstand the harsh conditions because they retained salt and water better. The selection continued once they were in the United States. African Americans who were able to withstand hard working conditions had better survival rates due to high water and salt retention. Second, today, because of different environmental conditions and increased salt intake with diets, water and salt retention are disadvantageous, leaving U.S. African Americans at disproportional risks because of their biological descent and culture. =Bio social inheritance model= Similar to the biocultural approach, the bio social inheritance model also looks at biological and social methods in examining health disparities. Hoke et al. define Biosocial inheritance as “the process whereby social adversity in one generation is transmitted to the next through reinforcing biological and social mechanisms that impair health, exacerbating social and health disparities.” Controversy There is a controversy regarding race as a method for classifying humans. Different sources argue it is purely social construct or a biological reality reflecting average genetic group differences. New interest in human biological variation has resulted in a resurgence of the use of race in biomedicine.Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference, MIT press. Page 188. \\"Far from waning in the age of molecular genetics, race has been resurgent in biomedical discourse, especially in relation to a torrent of new interest in human biological variation and its quantification.\\" The main impetus for this development is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of certain diseases by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors, such as genetically conditioned health factors, based on more easily ascertained characteristics such as phenotype and racial self-identification. Since medical judgment often involves decision making under uncertain conditions,Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference, MIT press. Chapter 9. many doctors consider it useful to take race into account when treating disease because diseases and treatment responses tend to cluster by geographic ancestry.Satel, Sally. \\"I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor\\". The New York Times, published May 5, 2002 The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup. Race in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect. Taking the example of sickle-cell disease, in an emergency room, knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race. The continued use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the continued use of racial categories in health care and as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services.Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference, MIT press. Chapter 5. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. David Williams (1994) argued, after an examination of articles in the journal Health Services Research during the 1966–90 period, that how race was determined and defined was seldom described. At a minimum, researchers should describe if race was assessed by self-report, proxy report, extraction from records, or direct observation. Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator of socioeconomic status. Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with and the role of the environment. = From concepts of race to ethnogenetic layering = There is general agreement that a goal of health-related genetics should be to move past the weak surrogate relationships of racial health disparity and get to the root causes of health and disease. This includes research which strives to analyze human genetic variation in smaller groups than races across the world. One such method is called ethnogenetic layering. It works by focusing on geographically identified microethnic groups. For example, in the Mississippi Delta region ethnogenetic layering might include such microethnic groups as the Cajun (as a subset of European Americans), the Creole and Black groups [with African origins in Senegambia, Central Africa and Bight of Benin] (as a subset of African Americans), and Choctaw, Houmas, Chickasaw, Coushatta, Caddo, Atakapa, Karankawa and Chitimacha peoples (as subsets of Native Americans). Better still may be individual genetic assessment of relevant genes. As genotyping and sequencing have become more accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically. Even when such methods become commonly available, race will continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research. Some doctors and scientists such as geneticist Neil Risch argue that using self-identified race as a proxy for ancestry is necessary to be able to get a sufficiently broad sample of different ancestral populations, and in turn to be able to provide health care that is tailored to the needs of minority groups. Association studies One area in which population categories can be important considerations in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. Association studies can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that are not related to the disease being studied, although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate. Various techniques detect and account for population substructure, but these methods can be difficult to apply in practice. Population genetic substructure also can aid genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer- range linkage disequilibrium between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers than is the case for other populations. Genetic studies can use this disequilibrium to search for disease alleles with fewer markers than would be needed otherwise. Association studies also can take advantage of the contrasting experiences of racial or ethnic groups, including migrant groups, to search for interactions between particular alleles and environmental factors that might influence health. Human genome projects The Human Genome Diversity Project has collected genetic samples from 52 indigenous populations. Sources of racial disparities in care In a report by the Institute of Medicine called Unequal Treatment, three major source categories are put forth as potential explanations for disparities in health care: patient-level variables, healthcare system-level factors, and care process- level variables. =Patient-level variables= There are many individual factors that could explain the established differences in health care between different racial and ethnic groups. First, attitudes and behaviors of minority patients are different. They are more likely to refuse recommended services, adhere poorly to treatment regimens, and delay seeking care, yet despite this, these behaviors and attitudes are unlikely to explain the differences in health care. In addition to behaviors and attitudes, biological based racial differences have been documented, but these also seem unlikely to explain the majority of observed disparities in care. =Health system-level factors= Health system-level factors include any aspects of health systems that can have different effects on patient outcomes. Some of these factors include different access to services, access to insurance or other means to pay for services, access to adequate language and interpretation services, and geographic availability of different services. Many studies assert that these factors explain portions of the existing disparities in health of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States when compared to their white counterparts. =Care process-level variables= Three major mechanisms are suggested by the Institute of Medicine that may contribute to healthcare disparities from the provider's side: bias (or prejudice) against racial and ethnic minorities; greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority patients; and beliefs held by the provider about the behavior or health of minorities. Research in this area is new and ongoing.

Eicosanoids are rapidly metabolized to inactive products and therefore are short-lived. Accordingly, the eicosanoid-receptor interaction is typically limited to a local interaction: cells, upon stimulation, metabolize arachidonic acid to an eicosanoid which then binds cognate receptors on either its parent cell (acting as an Autocrine signalling molecule) or on nearby cells (acting as a Paracrine signalling molecule) to trigger functional responses within a restricted tissue area, e.g. an inflammatory response to an invading pathogen. In some cases, however, the synthesized eicosanoid travels through the blood (acting as a hormone-like messenger) to trigger systemic or coordinated tissue responses, e.g. prostaglandin (PG) E2 released locally travels to the hypothalamus to trigger a febrile reaction (see ). An example of a non-GPCR receptor that binds many eicosanoids is the PPAR-γ nuclear receptor. The following is a list of human eicosanoid GPCRs grouped according to the type of eicosanoid ligand that each binds:  Leukotriene  Leukotrienes: * BLT1 (Leukotriene B4 receptor) – ; BLT1 is the primary receptor for leukotriene B4. Relative potencies in binding to and stimulating BLT1 are: leukotriene B4>20-hydroxy-leukotriene B4>>12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (R isomer) (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=267; also see ALOX12B and 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). BLT1 activation is associated with pro-inflammatory responses in cells, tissues, and animal models. * BLT2 (Leukotriene B4 receptor 2) – ; the receptor for 12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid, leukotriene B4, and certain other eicosanoids and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites (see BLT2). Relative potencies in binding to and stimulating BLT2 are: 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (S isomer)>leukotriene B4>12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (S isomer)= 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (S isomer)>15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (S isomer])>12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (R isomer)>20-hydroxy-leukotriene LTB4 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=268). Activation of BLT2 is associated with pro-inflammatory responses by cells and tissues. * CysLT1 (Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1) – ;CYSLTR1 is the receptor for Leukotriene C4 and Leukotriene D4; in binds and responds to leukotriene C4 more strongly than to leukotriene D4. Relative potencies for binding to and activation CYSLTR1 are: leukotriene C4≥ leukotriene D4>>leukotriene E4 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=270). Activation of this receptor is associated with pro-allergic responses in cells, tissues, and animal models. * CysLT2 (Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) – ; Similar to CYSLTR1, CYSLTR2 is the receptor for Leukotriene C4 and Leukotriene D4; it binds and responds to the latter two ligands equally well. Relative potencies in binding to and stimulating CYSLTR2 are: leukotriene C4≥leukotriene D4>>leukotriene E4 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=270). CYSLT2 Activation of this receptor is associated with pro-allergic responses in cells, tissues, and animal models. * GPR99/OXGR1 – ; GPR99, also known as the 2-oxoglutarate receptor 1 (OXGR1) or cysteinyl leukotriene receptor E (CysLTE), is a third CysLTR receptor; unlike CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2, GPR99 binds and responds to Leukotriene E4 much more strongly than to leukotriene C4 or leukotriene D4. GPR99 is also the receptor for alpha-ketoglutarate, binding and responding to this ligand much more weakly than to any of the three cited leukotrienes. Activation of this receptor by LTC4 is associated with pro- allergic responses in cells and an animal model. The function of GPR99 as a receptor for leukotriene E4 has been confirmed in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis. * GPR17 – ; while one study reported that leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4 bind to and activate GPR17 with equal potencies, many subsequent studies did not confirm this. GPR17, which is mainly expressed in the central nervous system, has also been reported to be the receptor for the purines, Adenosine triphosphate and Uridine diphosphate, and certain glycosylated uridine diphosphate purines (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=88) as well as to be involved in animal models of central nervous system Demyelinating reactions. However, recent reports failed to confirm the latter findings; a consensus of current opinion holds that the true ligand(s) for GPR17 remain to be defined (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=88).  Lipoxin  Lipoxins: * ALX/FPR2 (also termed FPR2, ALX, ALX/FPR, formyl peptide receptor-like 1) – ; receptor for Lipoxin A4 and 15-epi-Lipoxin A4 (or AT-LxA4) eicosanoids but also many other agents including the docosanoids resolvin D1, resolvin D2, and 17R-resolvin D1 (see specialized pro-resolving mediators; oligopeptides such as N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine; and various proteins such as the amino acid 1 to 42 fragment of Amyloid beta, Humanin, and the N-terminally truncated form of the chemotactic chemokine, CCL23 (see FPR2#Ligands and ligand-based disease-related activities). Relative potencies in binding to and activating ALX/FPR are: lipoxin A4=aspirin- triggered lipoxin A4>leukotriene C4=leukotriene D4>>15-deoxy- LXA4>>N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=223}. Activation of ALX/FPR2 by the lipoxins is associated with anti-inflammatory responses by target cells and tissues. Receptors that bind and respond to a wide range of ligands with such seemingly different structural similarities as those of ALX/FPR are often termed promiscuous.  Resolvin E  Resolvin Es: * CMKLR1 – ; CMKLR1, also termed Chemokine like receptor 1 or ChemR23, is the receptor for the eicosanoids resolvin E1 and 18S-resolvin E2 (see specialized pro-resolving mediators) as well as for chemerin, an adipokine protein; relative potencies in binding to and activating CMKLR1 are: resolvin E1>chemerin C-terminal peptide>18R-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid (18R-EPE)>eicosapentaenoic acid (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=79). Apparently, the resolvins activate this receptor in a different manner than chemerin: resolvins act through it to suppress while chemerin acts through it to stimulate pro-inflammatory responses in target cells  Oxoeicosanoid Oxoeicosanoid: * Oxoeicosanoid (OXE) receptor 1 – ; OXER1 is the receptor for 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) as well as certain other eicosanoids and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that possess a 5-hydroxy or 5-oxo residue (see 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid); relative potencies of the latter metabolites in binding to and activating OXER1 are: 5-oxoicosatetraenoic acid>5-oxo-15-hydroxy-eioxatetraenoic acid> 5S-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid>5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; the 5-oxo-eicosatrienoic and 5-oxo- octadecadienoic acid analogs of 5-oxo-ETE are as potent as 5-oxo-ETE in stimulating this receptor (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=271). Activation of OXER1 is associated with pro-inflammatory and pro-allergic responses by cells and tissues as well as with the proliferation of various human cancer cell lines in culture.  Prostanoid  Prostanoids and Prostaglandin receptors Prostanoids are prostaglandins (PG), thromboxanes (TX), and prostacyclins (PGI). Seven, structurally-related, prostanoid receptors fall into three categories based on the cell activation pathways and activities which they regulate. Relaxant prostanoid receptors (IP, DP1, EP2, and EP4) raise cellular cAMP levels; contractile prostanoid receptors (TP, FP, and EP1) mobilize intracellular calcium; and the inhibitory prostanoid receptor (EP3) lowers cAMP levels. A final prostanoid receptor, DP2, is structurally related to the chemotaxis class of receptors and unlike the other prostanoid receptors mediates eosinophil, basophil, and T helper cell (Th2 type) chemotactic responses. Prostanoids, particularly PGE2 and PGI2, are prominent regulators of inflammation and allergic responses as defined by studies primarily in animal models but also as suggested by studies with human tissues and, in certain cases, human subjects. *PGD2: DP-(PGD2) (PGD2 receptor) **DP1 (PTGDR1) – ; DP1 is a receptor for Prostaglandin D2; relative potencies in binding to and activating DP1 for the following prostanoids are: PGD2>>PGE2>PGF2α>PGI2=TXA2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=338). Activation of DP2 is associated with the promotion of inflammatory and the early stage of allergic responses; in limited set of circumstances, however, DP1 activation may ameliorate inflammatory responses. **DP2 (PTGDR2) – ; DP2, also termed CRTH2, is a receptor for prostaglandin D2; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating PD2 are PGD2 >>PGF2α, PGE2>PGI2=TXA2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=339&familyId;=58&familyType;=GPCR). While DP1 activation causes the chemotaxis of pro-inflammatory cells such as basophils, eosinophils, and T cell lymphocytes, its deletion in mice is associated with a reduction in an acute allergic responses in a rodent model. This and other observations suggest that DP2 and DP1 function to counteract each other. * PGE2: EP-(PGE2) (PGE2 receptor) ** EP1-(PGE2) (PTGER1) – ; EP1 is a receptor for prostaglandin E2; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating EP1 are PGE2>PGF2α=PGI2>PGD2=TXA2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=346&familyId;=58&familyType;=GPCR). EP1 activation is associated with the promotion of inflammation, particularly in the area of inflammation-based pain perception, and asthma, particularly in the area of airways constriction. ** EP2-(PGE2) (PTGER2) – ; EP2 is a receptor for prostaglandin E2; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating EP2 are PGE2>PGF2α=PGI2>PGD2=TXA2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=341). EP2 activation is associated with the suppression of inflammation and inflammation-induced pulmonary fibrosis reactions as well as allergic reactions. ** EP3-(PGE2) (PTGER3) – ; EP3 is a receptor for prostaglandin E2; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating EP3 are PGE2>PGF2α=PGI2>PGD2+TXA2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=342). Activation of EP3 is associated with the suppression of the early and late phases of allergic responses; EP3 activation is also responsible for febrile responses to inflammation. ** EP4-(PGE2) (PTGER4) – ; EP4 is a receptor for prostaglandin E2; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating EP4 are PGE2>PGF2α=PGI2>PGD2=TXA2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=343). EP4, particularly in association with EP2, activation is critical for the development of arthritis in different animal models. * PGF2α: FP-(PGF2α) (PTGFR) – ; FP is the receptor for prostaglandin F2 alpha; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating FP are PGF2α>PGD2>PGE2>PGI2=thromboxane A2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=344). This receptor is the least selective of the prostanoid receptors in that both PGD2 and PGE2 bind to and stimulate it with potencies close to that of PGF2α. FP has two splice variants, FPa and FPb, which differ in the length of their C-terminus tails. PGF2α-induced activation of FP has pro-inflammatory effects as well as roles in ovulation, luteolysis, contraction of uterine smooth muscle, and initiation of parturition. Analogs of PGF2α have been developed for estrus synchronization, abortion in domestic animals, influencing human reproductive function, and reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma. * PGI2 (prostacyclin): IP-(PGI2) (PTGIR) – ; IP is the receptor for prostacyclin I2; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating IP are: PGI2>>PGD2= PGE2=PGF2α>TXA2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=345). Activation of IP is associated with the promotion of capillary permeability in inflammation and allergic responses as well as partial suppression of experimental arthritis in animal models. IP is expressed in at least three alternatively spliced isoforms which differ in the length of their C-terminus and which also activate different cellular signaling pathways and responses. * TXA2 (thromboxane): TP-(TXA2) (TBXA2R) – ; TP is the receptor for thromboxane A2; relative potencies in binding to and stimulating TP are TXA2=PGH2>>PGD2=PGE2=PGF2α=PGI2 (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=346&familyId;=58&familyType;=GPCR). In addition to PGH2, several isoprostanes have been found to be potent stimulators of and to act in part through TP. The TP receptor is expressed in most human cells types as two alternatively spliced isoforms, TP receptor-α and TP receptor β, which differ in the length of their C-terminus tail; these isoforms communicate with different G proteins, undergo heterodimerization, and thereby result in different changes in intracellular signaling (only the TP receptor α is expressed in mice). Activation of TP by TXA2 or isoprostanes is associated with pro-inflammatory responses in cells, tissues, and animal models. TP activation is also associated with the promotion of platelet aggregation and thereby blood clotting and thrombosis.

When a Hollywood mogul buys Griffin's publishing house, Griffin is suddenly forced to confront the potential impact that not being Jewish may have on his career and his sex life. In Ninety-nine Novels, Anthony Burgess named Cocksure one of his personal selections for the best novels of the previous four decades.

His first name also is written in various forms, including Shevket, as on his gravestone. (; 15 December 1877, Elbasan, Manastir Vilayet, Ottoman Empire – 21 July 1946, Zürich, Switzerland) was an Albanian politician and wealthy landowner. Biography In 1922, Vërlaci was the biggest landowner of Albania. He was the leader of the Progressive Party, the biggest conservative party in Albania, which firmly opposed any agrarian reform reducing the landowners' property. The Progressive Party included some North Albanian clan chiefs and prominent Muslim landowners as its members. He was elected a deputy for the first time in the elections of April 5, 1921. In late 1922, Ahmed Zogu became engaged to Vërlaci's daughter, winning his support and the position of Prime Minister. In early 1924, Zogu was forced to cede his position of Prime Minister to Vërlaci, because of a financial scandal and an attempt of assassination in which Zogu was injured. The date of Vërlaci taking the position of prime minister is 3 March 1924. Vërlaci held this position until 27 May of the same year and then fled to Italy. During Fan Noli's regime that followed, a special tribunal created by the government condemned Vërlaci to death in absentia along with the confiscation of all his property. After being crowned King of Albania in 1928, Zog broke his engagement with Vërlaci's daughter and instead marry Countess Géraldine, of the noble Apponyi family. This resulted in a very conflicting relationship between Zog and Vërlaci in the following years. On 12 April 1939, after the Italian invasion of Albania, Vërlaci became the prime minister of the government of Albania formed under the Italian occupation. From 12 April through 16 April (until Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III accepted the Albanian crown), Vërlaci was the acting head of state. Vërlaci was also named by King Victor Emmanuel III senator of the kingdom of Italy. On 28 November 1939, there was an anti-Italian, anti-Fascist and anti-government street demonstration in Tirana, supported by a strike of industrial and transport workers. Vërlaci remained at the head of the government until 4 December (other sources cite 10 November or 3 December), 1941. He died in 1946 in Zürich, Switzerland, and is buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.

It was discovered on 5 November 1928, by Catalan astronomer Josep Comas i Solà at the Fabra Observatory in Barcelona, Spain. It was named after the discoverer by the feminine form of his nickname. The asteroid has a rotation period of 5.1 hours.  Orbit and classification  Pepita is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.7–3.4 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,966 days; semi-major axis of 3.07 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic. In May 1899, the asteroid was first observed as at Harvard's Boyden Station in Arequipa, Peru (). The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Barcelona.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Pepita is a stony S-type asteroid, which agrees with the body's measured geometric albedo (see below). Conversely, it is also classified as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by Tholen. = Rotation period and poles = Three rotational lightcurves of Pepita were obtained from photometric observations by astronomers Hilari Pallares and Enric Forné (2006, ), Pierre Antonini and René Roy (2007, ), as well as by Robert Stephens (2007, ). The consolidated lightcurve gave a well-defined rotation period of 5.1054 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.31 and 0.36 magnitude. In 2011, a modeled lightcurve using data from the Uppsala Asteroid Photometric Catalogue and other sources gave a concurring sidereal period 5.10532 hours, as well as two spin axes of (25.0°, −34.0°) and (231.0°, −30.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Pepita measures between 30.88 and 41.733 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1842 and 0.322. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1991 and a diameter of 39.27 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.40.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the discoverer, Josep Comas i Solà (1868–1937), by the feminine form of his nickname, \\"Pepito\\". He was the first director of the discovering Fabra Observatory and founded the Astronomical Society of Spain and America (, SADEYA). The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). The asteroid 1655 Comas Solà is also named after him, as is the Martian crater Comas Sola.
