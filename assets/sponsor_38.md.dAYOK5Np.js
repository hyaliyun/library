A person is more likely to accept an argument that supports a conclusion that aligns with his values, beliefs and prior knowledge, while rejecting counter arguments to the conclusion. Belief bias is an extremely common and therefore significant form of error; we can easily be blinded by our beliefs and reach the wrong conclusion. Belief bias has been found to influence various reasoning tasks, including conditional reasoning, relation reasoning and transitive reasoning.  Syllogisms  A syllogism is a kind of logical argument in which one proposition (the conclusion) is inferred from two or more others (the premises) of a specific form. The classical example of a valid syllogism is: ::All humans are mortal. (major premise) ::Socrates is human. (minor premise) ::Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion) An example of an invalid syllogism is: :: All teenage girls are ambitious. :: Teenage girls study hard. :: Therefore, girls study hard because they are ambitious. Typically, a majority of test subjects in studies incorrectly identify this syllogism as one in which the conclusion follows from the premises. It might be true in the real world that a) girls study and b) this is because they are ambitious. However, this argument is a fallacy, because the conclusion is not supported by its premises. The validity of an argument is independent from the truth of its conclusion: there are valid arguments for false conclusions and invalid arguments for true conclusions. Hence, it is an error to judge the validity of an argument from the plausibility of its conclusion. This is the reasoning error known as belief bias. When a person gives a response that is determined by the believability of the conclusion rather than logical validity, this is referred to as belief bias only when a syllogism is used. This phenomenon is so closely related to syllogistic reasoning that, when it does occur, in areas such as Wason's selection task or the THOG problem, it is called \\"memory cueing\\" or the \\"effects of content\\".  Dual-process theory of belief bias  Many researchers in thinking and reasoning have provided evidence for a dual-process cognitive approach to reasoning, judgment and decision making. They argue that these two mental processes (system 1 and system 2) engage in a constant battle for control over our brain to reason and make decisions. System 1 can be described as an automatic response system characterised by \\"unconscious\\", \\"intuitive\\" and \\"rapid\\" evaluation; whereas system 2 is said to be a controlled response system, characterised by “conscious”, “analytic” and “slow” evaluation; some researchers even claimed to have found a link between general intelligence and the effectiveness of decision making. It is important to note that the dual- process cognitive theory is different from the two minds hypothesis. Research done by Jonathan Evans in 2007 provided evidence for the view that System 1, which serves as a quick heuristic processor, fights for control over System 2's slower analytical approach. In the experiment, participants were asked to evaluate syllogisms that have valid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; valid arguments with convincing conclusions; invalid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; invalid arguments with convincing conclusions. The results show that when the conclusion is believable, people blindly accept invalid conclusions more so than invalid arguments are accepted.  Influencing factors of belief bias = Time = Various studies have proved that the time period for which a subject is allowed to think when evaluating arguments is related to the tendency for belief bias to take place. In a study done by Evans and Holmes in 2005, they recruited two different groups of people to answer a series of reasoning questions. One group of people were given only two seconds to answer the questions; whereas the other group of people were allowed to use as much time as they would like to answer the questions. The result obtained was that a higher percentage of incorrect answers were found in the time pressured group than the other; they concluded that this was a result of a shift in logical to belief-biased way of thinking. = Nature of content = The nature of the content presented can also affect belief bias of an individual as shown by a study done by Goel & Vartanian in 2011. In their experiment, 34 participants were presented with a syllogism upon each trial. Each trial were either neutral or carried some degree of negative content. Negative content involved in the experiment were politically incorrect social norm violations, such as the statement “Some wars are not unjustified, Some wars involve raping of women, therefore, Some raping of women is not unjustified”. For syllogisms where the content was neutral, the results were consistent with studies of belief bias; however, for syllogisms with negative emotional content, participants were more likely to reason logically on invalid syllogisms with believable conclusions instead of automatically judging them to be valid. In other words, the effect of belief bias is reduced when the content presented is of negative emotion. According to Goel and Vartanian, this is because negative emotions prompts us to reason in more careful and in more detail. This argument was supported by the observation that for questions with negative emotions, the reaction time taken was significantly longer than that of questions that a neutral. = Instructions given = In an experiment done by Evans, Newstead, Allen & Pollard in 1994, where subjects were given detailed instructions which lack specific reference to the notion of logical necessity when answering questions, it was shown that a larger proportion of answers actually rejected invalid arguments with convincing conclusions as opposed to when no further instructions were given when the subjects were asked to answer the questions. The results of the experiments reflects that when elaborated instructions were given to subjects to reason logically, the effects of belief bias is decreased.  Research  In a series of experiments by Evans, Barston and Pollard (1983), participants were presented with evaluation task paradigms, containing two premises and a conclusion. The participants were asked to make an evaluation of logical validity. The subjects, however, exhibited a belief bias, evidenced by their tendency to reject valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorse invalid arguments with believable conclusions. Instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs. Consequently, these results demonstrated a greater acceptance of more believable (80%), than unbelievable (33%) conclusions. Participants also illustrated evidence of logical competences and the results determined an increase in acceptance of valid (73%) than invalid (41%). Additionally, there's a small difference between believable and valid (89%) in comparison to unbelievable and invalid (56%) (Evans, Barston & Pollard, 1983; Morley, Evans & Handley, 2004). It has been argued that using more realistic content in syllogisms can facilitate more normative performance from participants. It has been suggested that the use of more abstract, artificial content will also have a biasing effect on performance. Therefore, more research is required to understand fully how and why belief bias occurs and if there are certain mechanisms that are responsible for such things. There is also evidence of clear individual differences in normative responding that are predicted by the response times of participants. A 1989 study by Markovits and Nantel gave participants four reasoning tasks. The results indicated “a significant belief-bias effect” that existed “independently of the subjects' abstract reasoning ability.” A 2010 study by Donna Torrens examined differences in belief bias among individuals. Torrens found that “the extent of an individual's belief bias effect was unrelated to a number of measures of reasoning competence” but was, instead, related to that person's ability “to generate alternative representations of premises: the more alternatives a person generated, the less likely they were to show a belief bias effect.\\" In a 2010 study, Chad Dube and Caren M. Rotello of the University of Massachusetts and Evan Heit of the University of California, Merced, showed that “the belief bias effect is simply a response bias effect.” In a 2012 study, Adrian P. Banks of the University of Surrey explained that “belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process.” Michelle Colleen and Elizabeth Hilscher of the University of Toronto showed in 2014 that belief bias can be affected by the difficulty level and placement of the syllogism in question.

Life He was sent by the Russian government in 1735 to assist in the Orenburg expedition in the rank of a sea captain. During this mission he was sent to explore Lake Aral, but was hindered by the Tartars from reaching the lake. He then employed himself in surveying the south-eastern frontier of Russia, particularly part of the basins of the Kama, Volga, and Jaik. Returning to St. Petersburg in January 1738, he took umbrage at not obtaining promotion and quit the Russian service. In the same year he proposed to some of the British factors at St. Petersburg to carry on a trade through Russia into Iran and central Asia by way of the Caspian Sea. Associating himself with Mungo Graeme, a young Scot, he obtained credit for a small cargo of goods suitable for Khiva and Bokhara. They left Moscow on 19 March 1738-9, and, proceeding down the Volga from Nijni Novgorod to Astrakhan, embarked on the Caspian for Karagansk. At Karagansk they received such unpromising accounts of the state of the steppe that they resolved to continue their voyage to Rasht in Iran. Elton was successful in finding a good market and in obtaining a decree from the shah granting them liberty to trade throughout Iran, and extraordinary privileges. He persuaded the Russia Company to take up his scheme, and in 1741 an Act of Parliament sanctioning the trade was passed. In 1742 two ships were built on the Caspian, and Elton was placed in command of the first completed. These vessels carried the English flag, which, however, Anthony Jenkinson claimed to have first displayed on the Caspian about 1558. The apprehensions of the Russian court were, however, excited by the intelligence that Elton was building ships on the Caspian, after the European fashion, for the Iranian sovereign, Nader Shah. On receipt of the intelligence the Russia Company despatched Jonas Hanway to make inquiry concerning Elton's proceedings. Hanway arrived at Rasht on 3 December 1743 and found Elton earnestly pressing forward the construction of Iranian vessels. The Russian court, indignant at Elton's action, refused to countenance the Caspian trade and ruined the expectations of the Russia Company. In the meanwhile Elton had constructed a ship of twenty guns for Nader Shah, of which he was placed in command. He was appointed admiral of the Caspian, and received orders to oblige all Russian vessels on those waters to salute his flag. During his service to Nader, he also twice transported supplies to Baku, and surveyed the southern coast of Dagestan as a preparation for another episode in his Dagestan campaign. The Russia Company, in October 1744, vainly ordered him to return to England, Elton replying by the transmission of a decree from Nader Shah, dated 19 November 1745, forbidding him to quit Iran. Offers of a pension from the Russia Company and a post in the navy from the British government were equally ineffectual. Disregarding the injury which he was inflicting on the Russia Company, he maintained that a British subject may with loyalty take service with any foreign potentate on friendly terms with England, and that he was under no obligations to Russia. On the death of Nader in 1747 he narrowly escaped assassination, but found protection from several of the Iranian princes. Finally, however, in April 1751, he espoused the cause of Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, and was besieged in his house at Gilan by the rival faction. He was subsequently taken prisoner by the governor of Gilan, Hajj Jamal Fumani, for his unwillingness to protect Rasht against the advancing Qajars. He was later shot dead. A great part of Elton's diary during his first expedition to Iran in 1739 is printed in Jonas Hanway's Historical Account of the British Trade over the Caspian Sea (1754). Lake Elton in south-eastern Russia is probably named after him.

It is an urban public high school with an estimated average student enrollment of 3,000 students. It offers many student-oriented services, specialty academic programs, extra-curricular clubs, various after-school programs and a wide array of scholastic sports. Taunton High School is one of the largest high schools in New England, and is the 4th largest in Massachusetts, behind Brockton, Lowell, and New Bedford. The main section of the building is divided into four different \\"houses\\" in which different classes are held, along with an associate headmaster’s office in each, and the main headmaster’s office in the middle. One of the houses in the main building complex once contained a public middle school, John F. Parker Middle School, until 2009 where, during a total renovation of the entire school, a fifth, exterior wing was added to the front of the school to house the displaced middle school students. Adjacent to school is the fine arts house, Robert H. Park Auditorium, which currently holds seating capacities up to 1,500 people, and beneath that the music rooms, dressing rooms, and storage. The school also shares a two-leveled gymnasium with Parker Middle School, where most of the indoor sports teams perform and a \\"pep rally\\" is held in the fall. The school's field house is one of the largest gymnasiums in New England, capable of holding both indoor track meets and basketball tournaments.  History  The requirement for High School level classes in Taunton was established in 1838. The City of Taunton, at that time, did not have a central building in which to hold high school level classes. The local school officials decided to hold high school classes in a neighborhood schoolhouse and rotate each semester to a different location. The first organization of a high school class was held in the District #11 Schoolhouse that later became known as the Woodward School at 52 Worcester Street. The rotation system continued for two years and the state of Massachusetts decided to discontinue the requirement for cities and towns to offer high school classes. From 1840 to 1848, there were no high school classes offered in Taunton. In 1849, Massachusetts, once again, required cities and towns to establish high school classes. The leaders of Taunton decided to hold high school classes in the basement of a church on Spring Street known as the Winslow Church. The classes continued at that location until local officials expanded the interior of the City Hall. The high School classes were moved to the second floor of Taunton City Hall in the mid-1850s and remained there until 1885 when a new High School was built on Washington Street on the site of a popular picnic grounds called 'King's Grove'. The Taunton High School on Washington Street received numerous additions as well as a face lift over the years. The building was in need of replacement and city officials purchased the Baylies estate on Williams Street to construct a new and current Taunton High School complex in 1975.  Renovation  Taunton High School underwent a $112 million renovation. The John F. Parker Middle School was removed from the High School and a new wing was constructed that houses the operations of the John F. Parker Middle School. The renovation was handled by the firm of Bacon & Agostini.

A Democrat, Jennings served five terms over 20 years. Background Gerald Jennings often goes by the name Jerry. Born in North Albany he began his career in the Albany City School District after graduating with a bachelor's degree from SUNY Brockport in 1970 and a Master of Science degree from the University at Albany in 1976. He served for 13 years on the Albany Common Council representing the 11th Ward. Jennings won an upset in the 1993 Democratic mayoral primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic city—over Harold Joyce, who had the Democratic Party’s formal endorsement and had only recently been its chairman. In 1993, he won the general election, becoming the 74th mayor of Albany. In a break from his party, Jennings endorsed George Pataki, a Republican, in the 2002 New York gubernatorial race. The mayor has also supported now-former U.S. Representative John E. Sweeney (R-Clifton Park). Jennings has been a strong proponent of the plan to build a convention center in downtown Albany. He hosts a call-in radio show on WGDJ every Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.Talk 1300 Radio Hosts He did not run for reelection and retired as mayor in 2013. Illegal guns Jennings is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of \\"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.\\" The Coalition was co-chaired by former Boston mayor Tom Menino and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Beginning in 2002, the Albany Police Department endured a scandal regarding illicitly purchased machine guns. Parking ticket scandal In November 2008, local media reported that for 15 years the Albany Police Department has engaged in an unapproved effort to avoid parking fines. It was alleged that an unofficial, secret system resulted in \\"zero fine\\" tickets being issued to an unknown number of local drivers who either had special windshield decals or were on VIP lists. Both the New York State Comptroller's Office and the Albany Common Council investigated the practice, and the Albany Times Union made a request under the Freedom of Information Law to obtain more information about it. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's audit faulted the city for \\"lax oversight that allowed at least two informal systems for skirting parking fines to flourish.\\" In November 2009, Jennings denied that he knew of any abuses in regard to parking tickets, and also directed that the issuance of no-fine tickets be ceased. Albany budget Albany has a strong-mayor form of government in which the city legislature (the Common Council) can vote on the budget, but a two-thirds majority is needed to override any disagreement with the Mayor. Albany's 2008 budget of $161.8 million was criticized for significant borrowing from reserves to bring it into balance. In 2007, the Common Council voted 9-6 to support the mayor's budget, although no cost-cutting measures were proposed or adopted. Later elections In the 2006 primary, Jennings was voted out of his position on the New York State Democratic Committee by state Assemblyman John McEneny. The mayor had served on the committee since 2002. This race was a rematch of the 1997 primary, when McEneny unsuccessfully challenged Jennings for the Democratic mayoral nomination. =2009 reelection effort= The Albany Times Union reported on November 25, 2008, that the mayor would seek re-election for a fifth term in 2009. The story noted that \\"Safety in the city, with its youth violence and gun crimes, continues to mar Jennings' leadership and Albany's image.\\" Jennings' opponent for the Democratic primary, Albany Common Council member Corey Ellis, announced his candidacy on March 2, 2009.

Ethnos360 has approximately 2,300 missionaries in more than 20 nations. Ethnos360 sends missionaries from local churches around the world to Latin America, West Africa, Southeast Asia and the Arctic. Countries include Brazil, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Greenland, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mexico, Mozambique, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand and formerly Venezuela. New Tribes Mission is also a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International. Focus and beliefs The mission's focus is on groups where no translation of the Bible exists. When such a group is identified, Ethnos360 first attempts to make contact and establish a relationship. Then, missionaries are sent to learn the language and the culture of the native people, while further developing relationships and providing humanitarian aid. The missionaries translate biblical literature into the indigenous language, as well as teach natives how to read and write in their own language. The professed goal, however, is to establish fully functioning churches that operate independently of missionaries, which \\"in turn reach out to their own people and to neighboring tribes\\". The core belief of Ethnos360 is \\"Sola Scriptura,\\" accompanied by a historical-grammatical hermeneutic in interpreting the scriptures. This emphasis on \\"word by word inspiration\\" leads to literal belief \\"in the fall of man resulting in his complete and universal separation from God and his need of salvation\\". Those who die unsaved go to \\"unending punishment\\" (hence the mandate to evangelize those without access to the gospel). Additionally, Etnos360 is a dispensational organization, subscribing to the \\"imminent... pretribulation and pre-millennial return\\" of Jesus Christ to earth. History=Founding= NTM was founded by Paul Fleming, from Los Angeles, in 1942. In the 1930s Fleming had worked as a missionary in the British colony of Malaya. Initially, NTM was based in a former nightclub in Chicago. In 1943 NTM started publishing its magazine Brown Gold. In 1944/45, NTM moved headquarters to Chico, California. Shortly thereafter it established a \\"boot camp\\" (missionary training facility) at Fouts Springs, California.Brown Gold. =Early activity expansion and associated personnel deaths= The organization sent out its first group in November 1942 to Bolivia. On January 12, 1944 the startling news came back that five of the men were missing. These five men had been killed, however the facts were not revealed until years later. Ethnos360's first five missionaries were killed by the Ayoreo Indians in Bolivia. According to Time Magazine, five NTM missionaries were killed by aboriginal Bolivians in 1943. In June 1950 the first plane bought by NTM crashed in Venezuela, killing all 15 people on board. The second plane bought by NTM crashed in November the same year at Mount Moran in Grand Teton National Park USA while on its way to bring missionaries abroad, killing all 21 aboard, including spouses, several children and founder Paul Fleming. In July 1953, 14 NTM members serving as volunteer firefighters died in what became known as the Rattlesnake Fire about 25 miles north of Fouts Springs, California in the Mendocino National Forest.Mendocino National Forest - Rattlesnake Fire Interpretive Site =Personnel deaths by guerrillas in Colombia and the Philippines= In the late 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, a number of New Tribes Mission personnel have been killed by guerrillas in different parts of the world. * In 1993 members of the FARC guerrilla movement abducted three New Tribes Mission missionaries from a village in Panama and brought them to Colombia where they were killed in 1996. * In 1994 two other missionaries were killed after being taken at gunpoint from an NTM school in Colombia. * In May 2001 Abu Sayyaf rebels in the Philippines kidnapped a NTM pilot, Martin Burnham, and his wife, Gracia, as they celebrated a wedding anniversary. In June 2002, during a rescue attempt by government troops, Martin Burnham was killed and Gracia Burnham received non-fatal gunshot wounds to the leg. Training program Ethnos360 requires all candidates to complete a training program. The training program can take up to four years to complete. In the US, this training culminates in an unaccredited bachelor's degree. Major Bible colleges such as Moody Bible Institute and Columbia International University recognize credits and degrees from Ethnos360. The first phase of the training consists of basic Bible education. This phase lasts two years. In the US, this training takes place at a school in Waukesha, Wisconsin. The school is called New Tribes Bible Institute. This portion of the training program is often waived for candidates possessing previous Bible training from accredited Bible colleges. The second phase of the program involves extensive study in cross- cultural communication, church planting, and linguistic analysis. It also lasts two years as candidates study advanced linguistic techniques, learning how to alphabetize unwritten languages and translate the Bible. Formerly called \\"Boot Camp,\\" this phase also emphasizes basic living skills necessary for survival in undeveloped areas of the world (e.g. constructing and cooking from clay stoves, building jungle shelters, etc.). In the US, this takes place at the Etnos360 Missionary Training Center in Camdenton, Missouri. An NTM Canadian training center exists in Durham, Ontario. Similar training programs exist in other countries, including Brazil, Germany, Mexico and United Kingdom. Evangelistic approach New Tribes Mission's strategy for \\"church planting\\" starts with language acquisition. NTM believes that individuals should have access to the Bible and its teachings in their native languages and refuses to teach in English or local trade languages. Several unwritten languages on the verge of extinction have been given new leases of life, because of missionary efforts to reduce them to writing and to teach their speakers in literacy. After becoming proficient in the local languages, NTM missionaries initiate in-depth Bible studies with interested parties. Rather than distributing tracts or showing the \\"Jesus\\" film (popular methods among many organizations), NTM focuses on teaching through the Scriptures chronologically. Missionaries begin with the Genesis account of creation and follow the storyline of the Bible through to the story of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the New Testament.Trevor McIlwain. Building on Firm Foundations. Vol. 1. Sanford: New Tribes Mission, 1987. 8. This approach is necessary because most of the cultures in which they work have no exposure to any biblical teaching whatsoever, and therefore require solid grounding on the foundational principles of the Old Testament before they can be introduced to the New Testament Gospel. This chronological curriculum consists of 50 lessons and is called \\"Building on Firm Foundations\\". It was written by Trevor McIlwain and Nancy Everson and originally published in 1985. Recognition Ethnos360 is listed by Ministry Watch on the Shining Lights 'Top 30' Exemplary Ministries. MinistryWatch.com, in response to requests for a list of Christian ministries that are among the best to which donors can give with confidence, has released a \\"Top 30\\" list of ministries as the latest MinistryWatch.com Shining Light profile. Ethnos360 is one of those Top 30 Shining Lights. Criticism and controversy=Criticism of cultural change= Critics contend that the New Tribes Mission and other evangelist groups \\"hunt down primitive Indians and destroy their culture in the name of converting them to Christianity\\". Paul Gifford, Professor of Religion at the University of London, accused NTM of changing indigenous cultures and representing US foreign policy interests in countries where they were active.Gifford p. 202 Due to such claims, in 1989, NTM was investigated, and subsequently cleared, of any wrongdoing by the all-party Parliamentary Human Rights Committee in Britain.Gifford, p. 114 However, a letter of protest signed by Bishop Trevor Huddleston, Lord Avebury, Chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group; Rabbi Richard Rosen; and Survival International President Robin Hanbury- Tenison, called on the Mission to halt its controversial activities and respect tribal religion and culture.Lewis 1988, p. 221 According to Stephen Corry, Director of Survival International, some missionaries do an enormous amount of work to help indigenous peoples and defend their rights, while others do great harm. He says he is not anti-missionary and that he himself and his organization have worked together with countless missionaries. He recalls how a senior member of a very large mission organisation personally told him that their critiques published in the 1970s had stimulated change for the better within his organisation.http://assets.survivalinternational.org/static/files/background/hakani- qanda.pdf =Deaths of members of the Ayoreo Totobiegosode tribe= Members of the Ayoreo Totobiegosode tribe, were forced into trucks and driven to a camp set up by NTM where they endured years of unpaid servitude, leading to numerous deaths from diseases introduced by the missionaries. The director of the mission, Fred Sammons, responded to these allegations with the claim that \\"The Indians live in fear, in fear of evil spirits and in fear of violent death because it's in their culture to kill. But when they come with us, they accept a new way of life... We never force our religion on anyone.\\" Mr. Sammons also wrote There are people who like to say that the Ayoreos are happy living in the jungle... Yet if you ask anyone who has had a taste of civilization if he wants to go back and live like he used to, the answer is always a very positive 'No'. Former Paraguayan minister of culture Ticio Escobar claimed that Ayoreos who were brought out of their isolation exhibited \\"all of the side effects of losing one's cultural identity: alcoholism, social disorganisation, apathy, violence, suicide, prostitution, and marginalization\\". =Nukak de-isolation= In 1981, in what is now the Río Puré National Park in Colombia, NTM missionaries interacted with the previously uncontacted Nukak people. Gift-giving led the Nukak to seek contact with settlers nearby. Combined with encroachment from guerrilla groups and cocoa growers, these later interactions with the outside world resulted in cultural instability and disease. Many members of the tribe now receive government subsidies in San José del Guaviare. =Political controversy in Venezuela= In October 2005, the BBC reported that Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez had announced his intention to expel New Tribes Mission from Venezuela. He accused New Tribes Mission of imperialism, of collaborating with the US CIA, of violating Venezuela's national sovereignty, and of violating the country's laws by making unauthorized flights into and out of the country. He also attacked the group for building lavish camps in which to live next to poverty-stricken villages. Responding to the allegations, NTM said, \\"Any kind of air travel we do, we always do within the guidelines of what the government allows. We always file reports.\\" With respect to \\"luxury\\" living, they \\"live in homes that make it possible for them to continue the work that they do. The homes that they live in are very simple.\\" On November 3, 2005, hundreds of Venezuelan indigenous people marched in Puerto Ayacucho protesting against the expulsion of NTM by the Venezuelan government. Although the Venezuelan constitution recognized their collective ownership of ancestral lands in 1999, \\"poverty remains acute among many Indian communities and many protesters said the missionaries were the only people who have tangibly improved their lives.\\" =Sexual abuse allegations= A 2010 report by G.R.A.C.E.(Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment), an organization dedicated to helping Christian organizations deal with abuse, documented reports of sexual, physical, emotional abuse at the Fanda boarding school operated by NTM for the children of NTM workers in the country of Senegal during the 1980s and 1990s. David Brooks, a dorm parent at the Fanda Boarding School (Sengal) in the mid-1980s, sexually molested multiple girls, including Kari Mikitson and Bonnie Cheshire. He was identified as the school's most prolific perpetrator of sexual abuse, preying on one girl alone more than 50 times. Kari and Bonnie started, in 2009, a blog with the mission to create a network for abuse survivors and pressure New Tribes into addressing the allegations. On the blog, many people who had attended New Tribes boarding schools around the world detailed their own stories of sexual abuse, including reports from additional countries. As more stories emerged, New Tribes Mission requested Mikitson to come to its headquarters in Sanford, Florida, for a face-to-face meeting with board members. Kari requested a G.R.A.C.E. investigation. The report identified seven alleged perpetrators by name and outlined the acts the perpetrators carried out. Additionally, the report mentioned David Brooks telling the abused, \\"He told these children not to tell, because bad things would happen and no one would believe them.\\" According to 1992 New Tribe field committee notes obtained by the Grace investigators, the group did have a policy on child sexual abuse that expressly stated allegations should not be reported to police and outlined guidelines for different kinds of acts: \\"If it is a homosexual act with a child, the person will be dismissed immediately and may never be considered for membership in the mission again. If it is a heterosexual act the person will be dismissed immediately but could be considered for ministry again in the future depending on the case. If it occurs in the field, it is not necessary to report it to the Senegalese or U.S. authorities. It must be investigated as not doing so could be ruinous for the mission.\\" However even if New Tribes Mission were to report the perpetrators, there was little that law enforcement could do. It wasn't until Congress passed the Protect Act in 2003 that the U.S. government could prosecute Americans for sex crimes committed overseas without going through the onerous and often impossible task of proving the suspect had traveled to that country for the purpose of abusing kids. * A part-time instructor with New Tribes Mission was charged in 2006 with molesting two boys.New Tribes missionary accused of molesting children.

The spread of the moths as an invasive species has resulted in the destruction of millions of hardwood trees throughout the eastern United States. Biography Trouvelot was born at Aisne, France. During his early years he was apparently involved in politics and had republican leanings. Following a coup d'état by Louis- Napoleon Bonaparte in 1851, he fled with his family to the United States. They settled in the town of Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, at the address of 27 Myrtle St. There he supported himself and his family as an artist and astronomer.Jimena Canales, A Tenth of A Second: A History (Chicago University Press, 2011) Trouvelot had an interest as an amateur entomologist. In the U.S., silk-producing moths were being killed off by various diseases. Trouvelot was very interested in Lepidoptera larvae including native North American silk moths which he believed could potentially be used for silk production. For reasons that remain unknown, Trouvelot brought some gypsy moth egg masses from Europe in the mid-1860s and was raising gypsy moth larvae in the forest behind his house. Unfortunately, some of the larvae escaped into the nearby woods. There are conflicting reports on the resulting actions. One states that despite issuing oral and written warnings of possible consequences, no officials were willing to assist in searching out and destroying the moths.The Gypsy Moth: Research Toward Integrated Pest Management, United States Department of Agriculture, 1981 The other notes that he was aware of the risk and there is no direct evidence that he contacted government officials.Watson, A., Fletcher, D.S. & Nye, I.W.B., 1980, in Nye, I.W.B. [Ed.], The Generic Names of Moths of the World, volume 2 © Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History), Publication Number 811 Shortly following this incident, Trouvelot lost interest in entomology and turned again to astronomy. In this field he could put his skills as an artist to good use by illustrating his observations. His interest in astronomy was apparently aroused in 1870 when he witnessed several auroras. When Joseph Winlock, the director of Harvard College Observatory, saw the quality of his illustrations, he invited Trouvelot to join the staff there in 1872. In 1875, he was invited to use the U. S. Naval Observatory to use the 26-inch refractor for a year. During the course of his life he produced about 7,000 quality astronomical illustrations. Fifteen of his most superb pastel illustrations were published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1881. He was particularly interested in the Sun, and discovered \\"veiled spots\\" in 1875. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1877. Besides his illustrations, he published about 50 scientific papers. By 1882, Trouvelot had returned to France and joined the Meudon Observatory where he worked with photography and became engaged in a bitter rivalry with his boss, the astronomer Jules Janssen.Jimena Canales, A Tenth of A Second: A History (Chicago University Press, 2011) This was a few years before the magnitude of the problem caused by his gypsy moth release became apparent to the local government of Massachusetts. He died in Meudon, France. The gypsy moth was considered a serious pest and attempts were underway to eradicate it (ultimately these were unsuccessful). To this date, the gypsy moth continues to expand its range in the United States, and together with other foliage-eating pests, cause an estimated $868 million in annual damages.

Retrieved March 27, 2016 The ecclesiastical province comprises the suffragan dioceses of Bydgoszcz and Włocławek. History Relics of St Adalbert, Gniezno Cathedral The Metropolitan Archdiocese of Gniezno was established in 1000 AD on the initiative of the Polish duke Bolesław I the Brave. He had the relics of the missionary and martyr Adalbert of Prague (Wojciech) transferred to Gniezno Cathedral, which soon became a major pilgrimage site. Here Bolesław met with Emperor Otto III in the Congress of Gniezno, where the duke obtained investiture rights and created the Gniezno archbishopric, superseding the older Diocese of Poznań. Led by Adalbert's half-brother Radim Gaudentius, the ecclesiastical province then comprised the suffragan dioceses in Kraków, Wrocław, and Kołobrzeg (extinct in 1015), and from about 1075 also Poznań. The position of the archbishops and their suffragans was confirmed in the 1136 Bull of Gniezno issued by Pope Innocent II. The Gniezno metropolitans held the right to crown the Kings of Poland and in 1412 obtained the status of a Primate of Poland. From 1572, they acted as interrex regents of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. When on 16 July 1821 the Diocese of Wrocław (Breslau) was put under direct authority of the Holy See by Pope Pius VII, Gniezno was affiliated in personal union (aeque principaliter) with the Archdiocese of Poznań. The union of Poznań and Gniezno was again dissolved with effect from 12 November 1948, when a personal union (in persona episcopi) between the Archdiocese of Warsaw and Gniezno was established.

History  During the legislative elections of 1 October 2001, the party won 2 out of 300 elected members in an alliance with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. It was led by Mufti Fazlul Huq Amini and Azizul Haq. In 2013, the party called upon its community to «severe ties» with atheists and the enemies of Islam, and to take it out in the streets to «foil conspiracies against Islam», and specifically asked the media not to associate this announcement with any other Islamic party whatsoever. A 2015 article in the journal Prothom Alo stated that the party had been inactive «in recent years». The spokesperson of the party said most of the party's activity happens over the phone. In January 2016 Islami Oikya Jote Chairman Abdul Latif Nezami announced to quit BNP-led 20-party alliance at a press conference. The OIJ chieh also stated that it is for their organization's interest. But after a few hours of the announcement of Islami Oikya Jote's quitting the BNP-led 20-party alliance, a faction of the Islamist party declared that it would remain with the coalition.http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/islami-oikya-jote- quits-20-party-alliance-198409 In April 2016, the Islami Oikya Jote congratulated the prime minister's decision to lash out the «atheist bloggers» behind the Ganajagaran Mancha's movement for highest punishment for 1971 war criminals. In July 2016, a faction of the party accused the Jamaat-e-Islami to be behind the recent terrorist attacks in Bangladesh. In March 2017, the Islami Oikya Jote expressed its desire to see all Islamic parties run independently for the 2019 elections in Bangladesh. In 2017, the party repeatedly warned that all non-Islamic idols must be banned from public places, including the Lady Justice statue in front of the Supreme Court. In July 2017, Islami Oika Jote formed a new alliance of Islamic parties to weigh against the Jamaat-e-Islami. Leaders Mufti Fazlul Huq Amini and Azizul Haq were the two most influential leaders of the party.

Jay Stewart announced for the first six weeks, after which Bob Hilton became the permanent announcer. The game changed format several times over its short run, but all forms involved some variation on asking questions with percentage answers or statistics. Gameplay=Couples format= Two married couples competed. One contestant from each couple was asked to estimate what percentage of 300 people answered a specific question correctly. Whoever was closest to the actual percentage, high or low, scored the actual percentage points. If both contestants guessed the same percentage, either contestant was given the option to change their estimate. The contestant who scored the points could then either answer the question (without conferring with his or her spouse) or challenge his or her opponent to answer. A right answer or a successful challenge added the remaining percentage points to the couple's score. For example, if 53% answered the question correctly, a team earned 53 points for the closer guess and could earn an additional 47 points from a correct answer to the question or a successful challenge. If the contestant with the initial control missed the question, the opponent could steal the points. Originally, a successful challenge also allowed the contestant to answer the question for the same number of points. The first couple to reach 300 points won the game and $300. Originally, if a team guessed the percentage exactly right, they won the game automatically. A week later, in addition to winning the game, the team won a cash jackpot that started originally at $25,000 and then $10,000 and increased by $1,000 for every game in which it went unclaimed. Any couple who won five consecutive games received a new car. =Solo contestant format= On March 3, 1980, the format was overhauled. Two individual contestants, one a returning champion, competed in a straight quiz. Three categories were in play in each game. Two of the categories were selected by the players before the game, with each player selecting one that they felt they knew the most about. The third category consisted of random general knowledge questions and was called Potluck. A round started with a category being determined by a randomizer, and two questions were asked in that category. The challenger chose a value from ten to ninety points in ten point increments for the first question with the points based on the percentage of the people surveyed who answered the question incorrectly, rounded to the nearest zero. Answering correctly earned the challenger the points, but the champion could steal them if the challenger did not answer correctly. The second question was played the same way, but with the champion determining the value. If one of the two preselected categories was chosen, both questions would be asked in turn. If Potluck was chosen, both questions were toss-ups and could be answered by either player by buzzing in. Later, every question became a toss-up. The first contestant to reach 250 points won the game, $500, and advanced to the bonus round. If there was no winner after five rounds, a final toss-up question decided the winner (the player who is in the lead getting to choose the category), who then advanced to the bonus round. Any contestant who won five consecutive games won a new car. =Bonus round= ;First format The couple gave a target percentage that was larger than zero. The host read a question and three possible answers. One answer (usually the correct one) was the most popular and awarded the most points. Another choice was a less popular answer, and the third answer received no response and scored zero points. The couple chose an answer and scored points based on the percentage of the poll that also gave that response. If the couple chose an answer which scored 0%, the bonus round ended immediately. The couple could also choose to end the bonus round at any time and take $10 per point earned. However, if a couple accumulated 100 points or more, the couple won $2,500. Also, if a couple chose an answer with a percentage that matched exactly the percentage stated at the start of the bonus round, the couple won a cash jackpot that started at $25,000 and increased by $1,000 each day. Starting the week of January 14, the format was changed to remove the jackpot. Also, the couple was required to choose both scoring answers before moving to the next question. ;Second format Starting on the show’s fifth week, a single question was presented with a list six of possible answers. Five of the answers were given by the survey respondents, and one answer was not given. Contestants chose answers one-at-a-time, winning $10 per point or $2,500 for guessing all five actual responses and avoiding the answer with 0%. As before, selecting the answer with 0% ended the game and forfeited all bonus winnings up to that point. The $2,500 cash prize was later replaced with a prize package worth between $3,000 and $3,500. When the format changed from couples to individual contestants, the champion was permitted to bring a spouse, other relative or friend onstage, but only for moral support—the champion was the only person who selected answers. (The supporter was permitted to suggest answers, but it was the champion's decision.) To ensure that the percentage points in this format always added up to 100%, the points awarded were based on the percentage of the people who responded with that answer in relation to the five most popular answers of that survey, not the actual number of people who gave that answer. From February 18 until the program's cancellation, the same prize package was at stake for the entire show until won. Episode status USA Network reran the series from April 27, 1987, to June 23, 1989. Game Show Network has aired episodes sporadically over the years.

The comic has been published in more than 50 books, magazines and comic volumes. A 3D computer-animated film of the same name was released theatrically in Argentina on September 9, 2010. Synopsis Gaturro is a brown cat with yellow cheeks. The series is about the life of a cat, named as the strip, who is in love with another cat called Agatha. However, she is not interested in him. Gaturro does not speak; he just thinks. However, when he communicates with his animal friends, he does speak. Among his most frequent activities, he usually walks on the roofs and goes to school. Characters Principal characters * Gaturro: He is a cat and the protagonist of the comic. He lives with his owners who have raised him since he was young. While his house is a charming place, he also enjoys roaming the rooftops of his neighborhood. Among the rooftops, Gaturro can interact with other characters from neighboring houses. Gaturro's owners send him to school every now and then, not for the education, but to get him out of the house. In school, Gaturro is a bit of a troublemaker and makes life difficult for his teacher, Ms. Ruda Vinagreti. Gaturro has also appeared dressed in formal clothes at his owner's office in some strips to issue a punchline in the form of a thought bubble, but what he does there has not really been explained. * Ágatha: She is Gaturro's neighbor. They have known each other for a long time and the relationship has always been the same: Gaturro is totally in love with Ágatha, but she never pays him attention. She is very jealous, selfish and she wants to be the only one rejecting him. Adoptive family * Daniel (the father): He is Gaturro’s owner. He represents the stereotype of a father of the middle classes who, even exhausted because of work, tries to fulfill his family responsibilities. He treats Gaturro as another son. He eats a lot and tends to spend most of his time watching television on his sofa. He is noticeably overweight. * Valeria (the mother): She is very understanding and affectionate, but also determined. She is completely dedicated to the house and the family, and she copes with stress by doing exercise or practising Feng Shui enthusiastically. * Luz: She is the oldest daughter of the family. Her incipient adolescence turned her so capricious and stubborn that she is constantly in trouble with the family, Gaturro included. * Agustin: He is the youngest son of the family. He seems to be the only one who treats Gaturro as a pet. He is very curious and passionate about video games. * The twins: They are the newborn babies, a boy and a girl. Their faces are not shown. * The mother-in-law: She is Luz and Agustin’s grandmother and Daniel’s mother-in- law. She does not live in the city but she visits the family once in a while. She speaks a lot. * Uncle Jorge: He is Daniel’s brother; that is to say, Luz and Agustin’s uncle. Even if he has a physical resemblance with his brother, he has a least serious and thinner look. Besides, he is not stressed at all. * The cousins: They are Luz and Agustin’s cousins. The only thing that is known about them is that they are naughty. Biological family: * Mamurra: She is Gaturro’s biological mother. She is overprotective with Gaturro. She always asks him to eat well, to wear sweaters, to study and to be careful. * Gatulongo: He is one of Gaturro’s cousins. He has a very long neck. He is friendly and quiet and he is never in a hurry. It takes hours for him to answer. He does not speak a lot. * Papurro: He is Gaturro’s father. He occasionally appears on the strip. Dynamism is not his cup of tea. He is lazy about everything. * Abuelurra: She is Gaturro’s grandmother. Just as Mamurra, she is very overprotective with Gaturro. She is always knitting sweaters for Gaturro because she is worried about keeping him warm all the time. * Tiurras: They are Gaturro’s aunts. They appeared in the strip on February 25th, 2007 for the first time. * Bisabuelurra: She is just like Mamurra and Abuelurra, but to a higher degree. * Hermanurro: He appears when Gaturro introduces him to Agatha. He is furrier and taller than Gaturro. * Gaturrín: He is the baby of Gaturro's household, and Gaturro adopts him as a nephew. Gaturro tries to instruct Gaturrín but often ends up learning from the baby cat. He is a very good observer of reality, and the weakness of Ágatha. He is often seen sucking on his pacifier, except when he is too busy sucking on his baby bottle instead. Cat friends * Gateen: She is the adolescent fox macho o hembra of the roofs. Gateen is an authentic \\"teen\\", with all adolescent skills that can be imagined. For instance, she is a money changer and a rebel (still does not know very well why, but wants to be rebellious). She is in the age of the great changes, and it shows. Deep down, she feels that nobody understands her. * Gaturranta: One of Gaturro’s friends that visits him once in a while. She is the opposite to Agatha, she is nice and a good friend. She helped Gaturro to make Agatha jealous more than once. * Katy Kit: Gaturro showed interest in her. She says to be famous and to appear on television and in magazines. She is quite frivolous and seems to only worry about her aspect. * Misha: She is the last cat to move into the neighborhood. She lives near Gaturro’s house. She has two little braids, she is very nice and active. She is constantly looking for new friends. * Elizabeth: She is the wealthy cat of the neighborhood. She lives in a mansion with her own and the butler. She studied in the London Miau Institute, travelled around the world and speaks several languages. Her butler is Jaime, who she is always asking for champagne. She is very delicate, elegant and distinguished. She likes to be flattered and taken care of. * Gaturrina: She is Gaturrin’s girlfriend. She is as little as Gaturrin. * Gatunislao: Her name is Gatunislao García Aristizabal. He is the posh cat of the neighborhood. He has a double surname and an important lineage. He lives on appearances. He says he has several houses, cars, fields, and yachts… but he actually has none of those things. * Gatovia: Agatha introduced him once as her boyfriend. He is well-built and muscular, although once Agatha touched him with her sharp nails and poked his muscles. He does not speak a lot. It is only known that he likes lifting weight. * Malurro: He is Agatha’s ex-boyfriend. He is really mean and does not want her at all. However, that is what Agatha likes most of him. * Tommy Cool: He is the coolest cat in the neighborhood. She dated Agatha, but they broke up because he was individualistic and would only care about the new trends. * Gasurro: He is Agatha’s ex-boyfriend. He is a singer of romantic music. * Gatalina Yoli: She is the new cat that comes to Gaturro’s neighbourhood and makes all the cats fall in love with her. She was going to marry Gaturro, but Agatha interrupted the wedding. * Gaturrón: He is a new character that appeared in Gaturro number 26. He is very big and robust. He is Gaturro’s cousin. * Aleili: She is one of Agatha’s sisters. She is always saying “yes” to everything, but when Gaturro asked her out, she said no. Animal friends * Arañita: He is a little spider. He is one of Gaturro’s friends who usually goes down hanging in his thread to visit him. They have a physical resemblance, since both have the same cheeks. * Ramiro: He is a mouse that lives in Gaturro’s house. Gaturro does not chase him nor haunts him. They are close friends. * Canturro: He is the dog of the comic strip (the \\"can\\" prefix being derived from Latin canis, \\"dog\\"). Having taken the phrase \\"man's best friend\\" too much to heart, he is convinced that he is the protagonist of the strip. Believing that he looks too much like Gaturro, he undergoes cosmetic surgery to become more \\"doglike\\". With this new face, he thinks that he can appear more frightening. * Emilio: He is the fish of the family and a friend of Gaturro and Gaturrín, who always look for a way to amuse him, although often that \\"fun\\" transforms into great \\"dangers\\" for the poor Emilio. He lives in a round fishbowl, in the living room of the house, near the armchair for the TV. * Canario: He is a bird and a friend of Gaturro. It is owned by a neighbor of Gaturro. Controversy For several years now there has been evidence of plagiarism in the strip, with several jokes and entire comics lifted from artists such as Quino, Leo Arias, Paz y Rudy, Roberto Fontanarrosa, Caloi (Carlos Loiseau), Juan Carlos Argüelles, Lola and, in the international field, Bill Watterson among others.http://www.elsol.com.ar/nota/144021/noticias/mas-turro-que-gato-una- pagina-se-encarga-de-mostrar-todos-los-plagios-de-nik.html List of books * Gaturro 1 to Gaturro 29 * Gaturro a lo grande 1 to 6 (Gaturro Big Size) * Te quiero mamá (I Love You Mom) * Sos mi Gaturrín (You Are My Gaturrin) * Te amo cada día más (I Love You More Each Day) * Gaturriendo (Gatulaughing) * Brutish English * Te Amo (I Love You) * Feliz Cumpleaños (Happy Birthday) * Esta es mi oficina (This Is my office) * Así se hace Gaturro (Making Gaturro) * Mini Gaturro (From 1 to 5) ReferencesExternal links * * Gaturro on GoComics * mundogaturro.com * Nik's website * Category:Argentine comic strips Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:1993 comics debuts Category:Fictional Argentine people Category:Fictional cats Category:Anthropomorphic cats Category:Male characters in comics Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993 Category:Comics involved in plagiarism controversies Category:Comics about animals Category:Comics about cats Category:Comics about dogs Category:Argentine comics adapted into films ","title":"Gaturro"},{"id":"2274918","text":"1828 in archaeology Explorations ExcavationsFindsPublications * Prussian Academy of Sciences begins publication of the Corpus Inscriptionum Graecum under the editorship of August Böckh.

The basic idea of a MoSoSo is to overlay a location and time element to the idea of digital networking. It enables users to find one another, in a particular vicinity and time, for social or business networking. Social software and groupware: CSCL and CSCW The term itself has its roots in social software and Groupware, computer applications designed for the desktop environment and aiming at facilitating various forms of social interaction, with the former being oriented to Internet-based informal exchanges, daily tasks and entertainment and the latter focusing on collaborative work (CSCW) or learning (CSCL) within a well defined group. Two typical groups that would benefit from these applications are or school classmates. While the term social software, introduced by Clay Shirky in recent years, has gained much popularity, Groupware is not anymore a trendy word, even if it has a strong tradition that goes back to the Eighties. Scientific research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) provides results which are still valid in the mobile environment. However, three important differences between desktop and mobile environments should be taken into account when conducting research on MoSoSo: firstly, the physical context of use moves from static desktop setting, where the user is typically sitting in front of his computer, to the more dynamic mobile context, which presents higher constraints to human attention, but also provides an opportunity for information or communication at any time and anywhere. Secondly, the social context becomes wider, shifting from the group to the network concept. Rather than relying on static and known membership criteria, where group members usually know each other, social network ties change often and are not as dense as in traditional groups. Therefore, network boundaries cannot be easily identified. A mobile social network is the social space determined by a MoSoSo application. Finally, an important distinction concerns the ultimate goal of MoSoSo applications, designed for usage in everyday life situations, including not only tools for communication, but also for coordination and knowledge sharing. From this perspective, MoSoSo is more similar to social software than Groupware applications, which aimed at increasing productivity and teamwork at work or at school. Technical perspective From a technical point of view, MoSoSo applications are very connected to the concept of Mobile Internet and the emphasis is more on data sharing than mere communication. Thus, only mobile phones with computational power, or Smartphones, can host this kind of applications. However, as there is not a universal definition of MoSoSo yet, many people consider as MoSoSo also phone calls and text messages, as they support social interaction on the move. In any case, the former perspective encounters wider consensus than the latter. The development of MoSoSo applications is rapid and already evolved from mobile extensions of Internet social networking sites to powerful software, providing novel opportunities for social interaction, especially when used for proximity interactions based on Bluetooth scanning and connectivity. The availability of GPS systems and the integration of maps in mobile devices offer great opportunities not only in the context of individual activities, such as \\"search\\", but especially in the social context. MoSoSo exploiting these possibilities is known as LBS-MoSoSo. As empowering social platform In one of the few critical studies on MoSoSo, Thom-Santelli (2007) argued that the real potential of MoSoSo was constrained by its limited conceptualization, and consequently implementation, as an urban entertainment gadget. Building on her argument, Lugano (2010) re-conceptualized MoSoSo as a general-purpose social platform for grassroots social change and proposed a holistic design model for empowering self-organizing digital communities to co-create, share and use community-generated services (CGS). By complementing public and commercial services, digital communities through CGS contribute to build resilience in people's lives and global information societies. Issues Being highly personalized and contextualized, privacy issues represent one of bigger obstacles to the wide adoption of MoSoSo.

History=Early years= On January 13, 1942, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the William Penn Broadcasting Company a construction permit for a new FM station on 47.3 MHz on the original 42-50 MHz FM broadcast band, with the call sign W73PH. Beginning the next month the station was issued a series of special authorizations to operate commercially with a temporary antenna, followed by its first full license on March 2, 1943. William Penn Broadcasting also operated AM station WPEN (now WKDN) in Philadelphia, and on November 1, 1943 W73PH was assigned the WPEN-FM call sign. After the FCC created the current FM broadcast band on June 27, 1945, William Penn Broadcasting applied to the FCC for a construction permit on January 21, 1946 to install a new transmitter and antenna for operation on 99.5 MHz, and the FCC approved this application on October 24, 1946. The station's license and construction permit were voluntarily assigned to the Philadelphia Record Company, owners of AM station WCAU (now WPHT) in Philadelphia, on November 28, 1947. This was effective December 18, 1947, and the station's call sign was changed to WCAU-FM the same day. On December 23, 1947, the FCC reassigned the station to 98.1 MHz, modifying the construction permit. The FCC granted a licensee name change from Philadelphia Record Company to WCAU, Inc. on March 3, 1948. The commission granted WCAU, Inc. a new license for the station for operation on 98.1 MHz on September 27, 1949. On December 4, 1953, the FCC granted WCAU, Inc. a construction permit to relocate the station's transmitter and antenna to the Roxborough section of Philadelphia. The station's license was renewed by the FCC with the new facilities on October 19, 1954. The FCC granted a voluntary assignment of the station's license to Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. on July 23, 1958. Until 1966, WCAU-FM simulcast the Middle of The Road music heard on AM 1210 WCAU. Along with other CBS FM stations, WCAU-FM began airing \\"The Young Sound,\\" a prerecorded format of instrumental easy listening songs based on contemporary hits. =Switch to oldies, then disco= In the fall of 1970, WCAU-FM replaced \\"The Young Sound\\" with an automated oldies format.\\"WCAU-FM Shifts to Solid Gold Automated Format\\", Billboard, October 10, 1970. For prerecorded announcements, the station used the voice of Jim Nettleton, a disc jockey on top-rated WABC in New York City. Prior to working for 77WABC in New York, Jim Nettleton was a very popular DJ on Famous 56 WFIL in Philadelphia from 1966 to 1969 before he was heard on WABC in late 1969 in New York. Live air personalities were eventually heard, with Nettleton moving from New York to host middays. The station played the hits from 1955 up to and including some current product. At the end of 1975, the oldies format was replaced by disco music, a hot trend at the time. As disco cooled, the station called its format \\"Fascinatin' Rhythm.\\" When the 1970s came to a close, the music became more diversified with the addition of jazz, pop and R&B.; The station experimented briefly with a format called \\"Mellow Rhythm\\" at this time, hosted primarily by Dr. Perri Johnson (now a music therapist in Los Angeles). =Hot hits \\"98 Now\\"= Program consultant Mike Joseph was brought into WCAU-FM in April 1981 to develop a new format to replace the struggling \\"Mellow Rhythm.\\" Joseph recommended that the station go Top 40. On September 22, 1981, at Midnight, the new format at WCAU-FM debuted: an all-current-hits, high-energy, jingle-intensive Top 40 sound dubbed \\"Hot Hits.\\" Joseph first put Hot Hits on the air in 1977 at WTIC-FM in Hartford, Connecticut, with a significant increase in ratings. Joseph called the station \\"98 Now.\\" WCAU-FM's ratings showed an immediate improvement, and subsequently, FM stations in major radio markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Saskatoon, and San Francisco picked up the \\"Hot Hits\\" format. WCAU-FM found a great deal of success with this programming for much of the mid-1980s, although the original \\"Fusion\\" jingles from TM were dropped in the summer of 1982 and replaced with a package from JAM to increase appeal to older listeners. Some notable DJs on the station in this period included Paul Barsky, Rich Hawkins, Billy Burke, Terry Young and Christy Springfield. =Return to oldies= In 1987, WCAU-FM found itself with stiff competition in the CHR/Top 40 format from WEGX, \\"Eagle 106.\\" CBS decided that WCAU-FM could be more profitable appealing to an older, more desirable demographic of 25-to 54-year-olds. On November 9, 1987, at 7 p.m., after playing \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" by Queen, WCAU-FM returned to the oldies format as WOGL (which stood for \\"Old Gold\\"). The first song on WOGL was \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\" by Little Richard. Eleven hours later, however, 102.1 WIOQ shifted to oldies as well. WOGL had a deep playlist, playing a larger number of songs than most oldies stations.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-11-13.pdf For the next year, the WOGL and WIOQ competed for Philadelphia's FM oldies audience, until WIOQ dropped the format early in 1989. Scott Walker, who programmed Hot Hits WCAU-FM, remained as Program Director. Originally, WOGL was known as \\"Oldies 98.\\" By 1992, WOGL incorporated more soul oldies. The station still played artists such as Elvis, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, but in addition, it focused on soul, including Philadelphia-only hits. The mix was about 2/3 R&B; and 1/3 rock and pop. The rock and pop songs played were the big hits typically heard on oldies stations. But WOGL also capitalized on Philadelphia's love of R&B.; WOGL played about 15% 1950s, 15% early 1960s, 55% mid-to-late 1960s, 13% 1970s, and 2% 1980s. WOGL aired specialty shows such as the \\"Hot Lunch Special\\" request show, \\"The Weeknight Hall Of Fame,\\" \\"Top 20 Oldies Countdown,\\" \\"Elvis & Friends,\\" \\"The Saturday Night Dance Party,\\" \\"Brunch With The Beatles,\\" and \\"Street Corner Sunday\\" (a Doo Wop music program). In 2001, all the specialty shows were purged. The playlist was moved away from soul and Philadelphia-only hits (though a few remained), and moved towards a more traditional playlist as found on other oldies stations. The music was about 70% 1960s, 10% 1950s, 15% 1970s, and 5% 1980s. Scott Walker left the station in 2001. By 2002, some of the specialty shows were brought back. A modified version of \\"Street Corner Sunday\\" was heard. While it was strictly doo wop in its previous incarnation, it was updated to play all types of pre-1964 oldies. More 1970s music was added and even some 1980s tracks were heard. In 2003, the name \\"Oldies 98\\" was downplayed and the station became known as \\"Motown Soul Rock & Roll: 98.1 WOGL\\". At that point, the station cut to one 1950s song per hour and one pre-'64 song per hour. It also played a couple of 1980s songs per hour. The rest of the music was roughly 50% mid and late 1960s and 50% 1970s music. In 2004, the playlist was tightened to about half 1960s and half 1970s. Their slogan also changed to \\"Greatest Hits of the '60s and '70s.\\" In late 2007 and early 2008, more 1980s music was added to the rotation, and effective July 6, 2008, WOGL's slogan was changed to \\"The Greatest Hits of the 60s, 70s and 80's,\\" which is also used on sister station WCBS-FM when it returned to an Oldies/Classic Hits format in July 2007. In late 2016, morning co-host Valerie Knight was fired after 14 years with the station. https://www.phillyvoice.com/breakfast-clubs-valerie-knight-out-wogl/ In 2017, Frank Lewis and Bill Zimpfer, co-hosts of WOGL's morning show \\"The Breakfast Club\\", were let go.http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/celebrities/breakfast-club-co- host-frank-lewis-out-at-wogl-20170628.html?arc404=true As of 2018, WOGL no longer plays 1960s and early 1970s music, with it's playlist shifting towards focusing on hits from the 1970s through the early 1990's, with a heavy focus on the 1980s, though the playlist is limited to avoid overlap with sister station WBEB, which airs an adult contemporary format. On January 21, 2018, \\"Street Corner Sunday\\" was discontinued after 29 years in favor of regular programming. =Jingles= From the late 1980s through the early 1990s, WOGL used jingles from Frank Gari Productions, Otis Connor, and TM Studios. From the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, the station used the Do It Again jingle package by JAM Creative Productions and the Super Hits package by Tony Griffin, both of which were also used by sister station WCBS-FM. From 2003-2017, the station used jingles from a variety of different JAM packages, most of which were resings of 1970s-80s top 40 station jingles. Since late 2017, the station has been using jingles from Reelworld Productions. =Entercom ownership= On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. Though CBS shareholders own 72 percent of Entercom, the latter is still its own public company, effectively separating WOGL and its sister stations from KYW-TV and WPSG-TV.http://www.insideradio.com/cbs- shareholders-bought-into-entercom-but-will-they- stay/article_faa93df4-cdc7-11e7-b667-df85c49e2501.html ReferencesExternal links * * OGL Category:Radio stations established in 1942 Category:Classic hits radio stations in the United States Category:1942 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Entercom radio stations ","title":"WOGL"},{"id":"2274937","text":"Albion House (also known as \\"30 James Street\\" or the White Star Building) is a Grade II* listed building located in Liverpool, England. It was constructed between 1896 and 1898 and is positioned on the corner of James Street and The Strand across from the Pier Head. __TOC__ History Designed by architects Richard Norman Shaw and J. Francis Doyle, it was built for the Ismay, Imrie and Company shipping company, which later became the White Star Line. After White Star merged with Royal Mail Line the headquarters remained at Albion House until 1934 at which time the British Government forced the merger of Cunard Line and White Star Line. The building is situated on the corner of The Strand and James Street. The facade is constructed from white Portland stone and red brick. In 1912, when news of the disaster of the Titanic reached the offices, the officials were too afraid to leave the building, and instead read the names of the deceased from the balcony. During World War II, the gable was damaged and was later rebuilt in the late 1940s. Albion House (White Star Line Building), Interior Lobby, Liverpool After many years being vacant, in 2014 the building was converted into a Titanic-themed hotel known as 30 James Street. Opened by Signature Living in 2014 the Grade II-listed 30 James Street Hotel, formerly the headquarters of Titanic owners White Star, now has a new operator. On Jun 23, 2020 A new hotel operator is to take over the running of Liverpool’s 30 James Street Hotel with original owner Signature Living now out of the picture. However, in the last few weeks the hotel was placed in receivership and now receivers Julian Clarke and Matthew Nagle of Savills have announced that another operator, Legacy Hotels, will take over the business. Legacy Hotels is already well known in the city, operating the Pullman Hotel on the waterfront and opening a Novotel at the new Paddington Village near the University of Liverpool. It currently operates a portfolio of hotels across the UK and Europe. The new operators are seeking to preserve as many of existing jobs as possible despite what they describe as the “challenging” economic situation brought about by the UK’s coronavirus lockdown Architecture Perspective drawing of the Building The design closely follows the architect's earlier work of 1887, the former New Scotland Yard building in London. In the 1980s, the Offices in Albion House were noted for their exquisite Office desks of fine wood. The entrance to the building at James Street has a fine mosaic of South America set into the floor, also near the James Street entrance inside Albion House was a wooden war memorial listing the members of staff who \\"Gave their lives for their country\\" in the 1914-18 War. Albion House is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.

The film also features the return of Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer and Walt Gorney, who respectively portrayed Alice Hardy, Pamela Voorhees, and Crazy Ralph in the first film. It is the second installment in the Friday the 13th film series. Set five years after the events of Friday the 13th, the plot again follows a group of camp counselors who arrive at a training camp at Crystal Lake, only to be murdered one by one by an unknown assailant. The film marks the debut of Jason Voorhees as the main antagonist, a role which the character would maintain for most subsequent sequels. Originally, Part 2 was intended to be an anthology film based on the Friday the 13th superstition. However, after the popularity of the original film's surprise ending, the filmmakers opted to continue the story and mythology surrounding Camp Crystal Lake, a trend which would be repeated in every film in the franchise. Like the original film, Part 2 faced opposition from the Motion Picture Association of America, who noted its \\"accumulative violence\\" as problematic, resulting in numerous cuts being made to allow an R rating. The film was released theatrically in North America on May 1, 1981. Although it did not gross as much as the original, Friday the 13th Part 2 grossed $21.7 million in the U.S. on a budget of $1.25 million and received negative reviews from critics. A direct sequel, Friday the 13th Part III, was released one year later.  Plot  Two months after the murders at Camp Crystal Lake, sole survivor Alice Hardy is recovering from her traumatic experience. In her apartment, when Alice opens the refrigerator to get her cat some food, she finds the severed head of Pamela Voorhees in her refrigerator and is murdered by an unknown assailant with an ice pick to her temple. Five years later, Paul Holt opens a school for camp counselors on the shore of Crystal Lake. The camp is attended by Sandra Dier, her boyfriend Jeff Dunsberry, troublemaker Scott Cheney, tomboy Terry McCarthy, wheelchair-bound Mark Jarvis, sweet-natured Vickie Perry, jokester Ted Bowen, and Paul's assistant Ginny Field, as well as many other trainees. Around the campfire that night, Paul tells the counselors the legend of Jason Voorhees, a boy who drowned at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957, prompting his mother to exact revenge on the counselors and commit another series of murders in 1979 to prevent the camp from being reopened, until she was killed by the last survivor; however, Jason is rumored to have survived and is now living in the woods near Crystal Lake, killing anyone who comes across him to avenge his mother's death. After Paul finishes the story, a man with a spear scares everyone, but it's only Ted in a mask. Paul reassures everyone that Jason is dead and that Camp Crystal Lake is now condemned and off limits. That night, Crazy Ralph wanders onto the property to warn the group but is garroted from behind a tree by an unseen killer. The following day, Jeff and Sandra sneak off to Camp Crystal Lake and find a dog carcass before getting caught by Deputy Winslow and returned to the camp. Later, Winslow spots a masked man in a burlap sack running across the road and chases him into the woods, where he finds a shack before the man kills him with a hammer claw. Back at camp, Paul offers the others one last night on the town before the training begins; six stay behind, including Jeff and Sandra, who are forced to stay as punishment for sneaking off. At the bar, Ginny muses that if Jason were still alive and had witnessed his mother's death, it may have left him with no distinction between life and death, or right and wrong. Paul dismisses the idea, proclaiming that Jason is nothing but an urban legend. Meanwhile, the assailant appears at the camp and kills the counselors, one by one. Scott has his throat slit with a machete while caught in a rope trap, and Terry is killed off-screen upon finding his dead body. Mark gets the machete slammed into his face and falls down a flight of stairs. The killer then moves upstairs and impales Jeff and Sandra with a spear as they have sex, and then stabs Vickie with a kitchen knife. Later, Ginny and Paul return to find the place in disarray. In the dark, the killer ambushes Paul and continues to chase Ginny throughout the camp and into the woods, where she comes across the shack. After barricading herself inside, she finds an altar with Pamela Voorhees' severed head on it, surrounded by a pile of bodies. Realizing that Jason Voorhees is the killer, Ginny puts on Pamela's sweater and tries to psychologically convince Jason that she is his mother. The ruse works for a time, until Jason sees his mother's head on the altar and resumes his attack on Ginny. Paul appears and attacks Jason, but he is quickly overwhelmed. Just as Jason is about to kill Paul with a pickaxe, Ginny picks up the machete and slams it down into Jason's shoulder, seemingly killing him. Paul and Ginny return to the cabin and hear someone outside. Thinking that Jason has followed them, they open the door, only to find Terry's dog, Muffin. Just as they sigh in relief, an unmasked Jason bursts through the window from behind and grabs Ginny. She then awakens to being loaded into an ambulance, and calls out for Paul, who is nowhere to be seen, leaving his fate ambiguous. Back in the shack, Pamela Voorhees' head remains on the altar, with Jason nowhere to be found.  Cast  * Amy Steel as Ginny Field * John Furey as Paul Holt * Adrienne King as Alice Hardy * Steve Daskewisz as Jason Voorhees ** Warrington Gillette as Jason Voorhees (unmasked) * Stu Charno as Ted Bowen * Lauren-Marie Taylor as Vickie Perry * Marta Kober as Sandra Dier * Tom McBride as Mark Jarvis * Bill Randolph as Jeff Dunsberry * Kirsten Baker as Terry McCarthy * Russell Todd as Scott Cheney * Walt Gorney as Crazy Ralph * Betsy Palmer as Pamela Voorhees * Jack Marks as Deputy Winslow * Cliff Cudney as Max  Production = Development = Following the success of Friday the 13th in 1980, Paramount Pictures began plans to make a sequel. First acquiring the worldwide distribution rights, Frank Mancuso, Sr. stated, \\"We wanted it to be an event, where teenagers would flock to the theaters on that Friday night to see the latest episode.\\" The initial ideas for a sequel involved the \\"Friday the 13th\\" title being used for a series of films, released once a year, that would not have direct continuity with one another but be a separate \\"scary movie\\" in their own right. Phil Scuderi—one of three owners of Esquire Theaters, along with Steve Minasian and Bob Barsamian, who produced the original film—insisted that the sequel have Jason Voorhees, Pamela's son, even though his appearance in the original film was only meant to be a joke. Steve Miner, associate producer on the first film, believed in the idea and would go on to direct the first two sequels, after Cunningham opted not to return to the director's chair. Miner would use many of the same crew members from the first film while working on the sequels. Cunningham had mixed feelings about the entire \\"Friday the 13th\\" enterprise that he outlined for film critic and author Stephen Hunter in an interview for a book Hunter wrote on violent films. Hunter stated that Cunningham \\"wasn't particularly proud\\" of his work on these films, and Cunningham bluntly said that the only thing that seemed to reach a teenaged audience at that time involved high levels of gore and graphic violence. = Casting = Adrienne King was pursued by an obsessed fan after the success of the original Friday the 13th and purportedly wished her role to be small as possible, though in the documentary Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th, it was stated that King's agent had asked for a higher salary, which the studio could not afford. The film's heroine, Ginny, is played by Amy Steel, who won the part through an audition. \\"At the time of [making the film], it was before the genre really picked up so I didn’t give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another audition because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from a lot of the people working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and you see a lot of that when I’m on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences. I wanted her to have some power.\\" Actor Warrington Gillette played Jason unmasked at the end of the film. Stuntman Steve Daskawisz (also known as Steve Dash) was credited as Jason Stunt Double but played the masked Jason throughout the rest of the film. = Filming = The small village of New Preston, Connecticut was one of the filming locations. Principal photography took place from October 3 and finished in November 1980, and primarily occurred in New Preston and Kent, Connecticut. Special effects artist Tom Savini was asked to work on the film but declined because he was already working on another project, Midnight (1982). In addition, he was not receptive to the concept of Jason as the killer in the film. Savini was then replaced by Stan Winston. Winston, however, had a scheduling conflict and had to drop out of the project. The make-up effects were ultimately handled by Carl Fullerton. Fullerton designed the \\"look\\" for the adult Jason Voorhees and went with long red hair and a beard while following the facial deformities established in the original film in the make- up designed by Tom Savini for Jason as a child. Fullerton's look for the adult Jason was abandoned in the sequel, Friday the 13th Part 3, despite the fact that the film took place the following day and was helmed by the same director, Steve Miner. Some fans have theorized that the sequence showing Jason with a beard and long hair reflects a \\"dream\\" rather than a reality because the following sequel picks up with the events showing his face having not happened, and therefore what was represented was Ginny's guess at what he looked like under the burlap sack rather than what he actually looked like, which would excuse the break in continuity. Steve Daskawisz was rushed to the emergency room during filming after Amy Steel cut his hand with a machete. Steel explained, \\"The timing was wrong, and he didn't turn his pickaxe properly, and the machete hit his finger.\\" Daskawisz received thirteen stitches on his middle finger. During the subsequent shoot, Daskawisz was forced to wear a piece of rubber over his finger, and both he and Steel insisted on reshooting this scene. During one take of Alice being killed by Jason, the ice pick prop didn't retract, injuring King. In one scene where Daskawisz was wearing the burlap flour sack, part of the flour sack was flapping at his eye, so the crew used tape inside the eye area to prevent it from flapping. Daskawisz received rug burns around his eye from the tape from wearing the rough flour sack material for hours. The use of the sack hood was similar to the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown. The scene where Steel's character gets grabbed from behind by an unmasked Jason in the climax took three takes to shoot it right. Steel was tense and frightened during filming of the scene. Rumors sparked that John Furey left before the film wrapped, as his character does not appear in the end. In truth, his character was not intended to have appeared. =Post-production= Like its predecessor, Friday the 13th Part 2 had difficulty receiving an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Upon reviewing the film, the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) warned Paul Hagger, an executive at Paramount, that the \\"accumulation of violence throughout the film\\" may still lead to an X rating even if substantial cuts were made. A total of forty-eight seconds had to be cut from the film in order to avoid an X rating. This film received a deluxe DVD release in February 2009, but the edited footage was not included. Most noted by censors was the murder scene of Jeff and Sandra, who are impaled by a spear while having sex in a bed (a scene many have compared to a scene in Mario Bava's A Bay of Blood), which the censors found particularly graphic. In September 2020, it was announced that the uncut footage had been located by Samuelson Studios and was included as an extra on the upcoming box set release from Scream Factory. After Paramount discovered actress Marta Kober was underage, a scene showing her with full frontal nudity was completely deleted. Originally, the film was supposed to end with Mrs. Voorhees' head opening her eyes and smiling towards the camera. However, Miner removed the scene out of the final film as he ultimately decided that would make the film's conclusion \\"too silly\\". To this day, the footage of this alternate ending has yet to be released. Music  In 1982, Gramavision Records released an LP album of selected pieces of Harry Manfredini's scores from the first three Friday the 13th films. On January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six films. It sold out in less than 24 hours. Waxworks Records released the score, composed by Harry Manfredini, on vinyl in summer 2015. Release=Home media= Friday the 13th Part 2 was released on VHS and Betamax by Paramount Home Video in 1981. Paramount reissued the VHS again in 1994. The film was first released on DVD by Paramount on October 19, 1999, in a standard widescreen release featuring the theatrical trailer as the sole bonus feature. In 2009, Paramount issued a \\"deluxe edition\\" of the film on both DVD and Blu-ray, which included several documentary featurettes along with the theatrical trailer. In 2011, it was released in a 4-disc DVD collection along with the first, third, and fourth films in the series. It was again included in two Blu-ray sets: Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection, released in 2013, and Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection, in 2011 with a roughly 3/4 size replica of Jason's mask and glossy cardstock booklet (this collection was re-released in 2018 in a plastic multi-disc case). In October 2020, Shout Factory is releasing a 40th Anniversary box set which includes a 4K scan of part 2's original camera negative and will also include the long lost uncut footage. Reception=Box office= The film was released theatrically on May 1, 1981, bringing in $6,429,784 its opening weekend. It played on 1,350 screens and would ultimately gross $21.7 million on a budget of $1.25 million. It was the 35th highest-grossing film of 1981, facing strong competition from such high- profile horror releases as Omen III: The Final Conflict, The Evil Dead, The Howling, My Bloody Valentine, Happy Birthday to Me, Graduation Day, Halloween II, and The Burning. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Friday the 13th Part 2 holds a 27% approval rating based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 4.43/10. The consensus reads: “Friday the 13th Part 2 sets the template for the franchise to follow with more teen victims, more gruesome set pieces, and fewer reasons to keep following along.” Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Friday the 13th Part 2 is \\"a cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead teenager genres; about two dozen movies a year feature a mad killer going berserk, and they're all about as bad as this one. Some have a little more plot, some have a little less. It doesn't matter.\\" Helen Verongos of The Clarion-Ledger wrote: \\"Friday the 13th Part 2 obviously does not pretend to be any more than it is, a cheapdimestore cheapthriller aimed at the adolescent market... It is designed to be predictable enough to make the average fourth-grader feel sharp-witted.\\" The Dayton Journal Heralds Terry Lawson deemed the film a \\"special effects freak show for an audience immune to violence,\\" and \\"exploitative and gratuitous.\\" Jacqi Tully of the Arizona Daily Star praised the film's special effects, noting Jason as \\"effectively disgusting sight,\\" and ultimately summarizing: \\"Gross is a pretty good way to describe it. Scary, bloody and violent come to mind, too. Also very effective.\\" Howard Pousner of The Atlanta Constitution was less laudatory, deeming the return of the Jason Voorhees character as a \\"ludicrous arrangement... before you know it, eight more people have been murdered in virtually every manner: a neck sliced by barbed wire, a skull smashed, a jugular macheteed sic, a heart speared, et al.\\" When reviewing the film's Blu-ray release, David Harley of Bloody Disgusting said, \\"It doesn't exactly stray far from the formula of the original film — neither do most of the other sequels — but Friday The 13th Part II still stands as an iconic and important entry in the series due to the introduction of Jason as the antagonist of the series and the usage of Italian horror films as an inspiration for its death scenes — most notably, the spear copulation death from Mario Bava’s A Bay of Blood.\\" Scott Meslow of The Week described it as a transitional film that blended elements of the original film and those to come later in the series.

Also known as the White Committee, its leader until January 1941 was William Allen White. Other important members included Clark Eichelberger and Dean Acheson. The CDAAA shared its leadership with the dissolved Non-Partisan Committee for Peace through Revision of the Neutrality Law (NPC), who was also chaired by White and directed by Eichelberger. Additionally, the CDAAA used ex-NPC offices in the League of Nations building at 8 W. Fortieth Street in New York City, as their central base. This has drawn commentators to regard the CDAAA as the successor to the NPC. The primary objective of the CDAAA was to achieve pro- British politics in U.S. government against the Axis Powers. This included economic and material support by America through the Destroyer-for-Bases Agreement and the Lend-Lease policy. The CDAAA, however, advocated against the declaration of war against Germany or any other belligerents until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.  Organisation and membership  Unlike other pro-intervention groups like the NPC and Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression (ACNPJA), the CDAAA actively incorporated the public into committees. As a result, 300 self-financed, self-controlled local units had been created across America by 1st July 1940. This improved the mobilisation of its membership, which was especially significant considering its reliance on its members for outreach work. For example, volunteers from the Minneapolis unit sent out thousands of mimeographed letters, pamphlets, \\"V for Victory\\" stickers, \\"Stop Hitler\\" matches and aid-to-Britain Christmas cards during the war to gather funding and draw support for intervention on behalf of the Allies. However, while their geographic coverage was broad, the CDAAA lacked depth in various U.S. States: while Massachusetts had 137 chapters in April 1941, Idaho only had 1. The CDAAA used a \\"qualitative approach\\" when structuring their organisation to counter the wealthy, white male predominance of their leadership and target groups that were divided on the issue of U.S. intervention into World War Two. This meant separating the organisation into four distinct groups: the youth division, the college division, the women's division, and the labour division. = Interaction with African-American communities = The committee targeted African-Americans as a group to cultivate support, which helped diversify their membership. They released pamphlets such as \\"Coloured People Have a Stake in the War\\" to relate pro-Allied intervention to entice their membership. High-profile African- Americans, such as Ralph Bunche- who, from 1941, held a position in the Office of Strategic Services [OSS]- were included in their national committee. The CDAAA campaigned for anti-discriminatory legislation that coincided with their pro-interventionist stance. For example, in response to Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802, the CDAAA published a press release that called for an extension of the ban on racist employment practices to the armed services, as \\"anti- Negro discrimination was inconsistent with the democratic principles which the American people as a whole are being called upon to defend.\\" However, the CDAAA's segregation of African-American membership caused resentment within their communities; when Phillip A. Randolph joined the CDAAA, he argued that the formation of a separate \\"Negro-branch\\" undermined the independence of African-American organisations and \\"savour[ed] jim-crowism\\".  Aims and methods  The primary concern of the CDAAA was to ensure America's national security during the Second World War. It believed the best strategy for this was the provision of economic and material support to its allies, especially Britain's campaign against Nazi Germany. In a statement in July 1940, White made this position clear; he argued that Britain was America's first line of defence and that, if Britain were not supported, the United States would become \\"the subject of an envy that would lead to attack.\\" In spite of their interventionist advocacy, the CDAAA refused to further their aims towards a declaration of war against the Axis Powers. = Involvement in the 1940 Destroyer-for-Bases Exchange = In May 1940, Winston Churchill requested the purchase of U.S.Navy Destroyers to bolter the British Royal Navy. F. D. Roosevelt was hesitant to agree because of the Neutrality Acts, which banned the shipment or sale of arms from the U.S. to any combatant nation, and the existing anti-interventionist sentiment that drove the passage of these reforms. Furthermore, this request coincided with election year, which made Roosevelt increasingly sensitive to public opinion. In response, the CDAAA campaigned to drive popular support for the selling of military resources to Britain. Robert Sherwood penned the provocative newspaper advertisement \\"Stop Hitler Now\\", published on 10th June 1940, which urged the American people to ask their president and congressional representatives to support maximum aid to the Allies. He argued that the conquest of Europe would leave America \\"alone in a barbaric world.\\" This effort was supported by the Pershing Address on 4th August 1940, which the CDAAA organised with co-operation with the Century Group. John J. Pershing's comments gained significant traction from the press, with the New York Herald Tribune printing the story as its front- page and the New York Times publishing it under the headline, “Pershing Warns U.S. to Aid Britain by Sending 50 Destroyers Now.” Alongside popular mobilisation, the CDAAA pursued the legitimisation of this suggested trade by finding legal grounding from existing laws. On 11th August 1940, a document named “No Legal Bar Seen to Transfer of Destroyers\\" was published, which suggested that no further consent was required from Congress for Roosevelt to conduct the selling of Navy Destroyers to Britain. This was signed by Charles C. Burlingham of the New York Bar, former solicitor general Thomas D. Thatcher, former Federal Trade Commission member George Rublee, and Dean Acheson. In the build-up to the 1940 election, the CDAAA worked to ensure that no partisan debate arose in regard to the degree of American intervention into World War Two. This was facilitated by their nonpartisan position, which allowed them to endorse both Roosevelt and Wendel Willkie, who were both pro- interventionists. When Willkie was announced as the Republican candidate on 17th August, he didn't explicitly refer to the destroyers but did concede that the loss of the British fleet would “greatly weaken our defense” and an Atlantic dominated by Germany would be “a calamity.” On September 3, 1940, in retrospect of popular and legal opinion swinging into his favour, Roosevelt announced the exchange of 50 U.S.warship in return for the right to lease naval and air bases in eight different British territories. This was a great success for the CDAAA. Following the election, on November 26, 1940, the CDAAA released a new statement of policy to further their aims. It included support for \\"the maintenance of the lifeline between Great Britain and the United States,\\" the \\"assumption by Congress of greater responsibility with the President,\\" and the repeal of \\"restrictive legislation.\\" = Involvement in the 1941 Lend-Lease: = Similar to in 1940, the CDAAA used popular pressure to exert influence over the U.S. government in favour of Lend-Lease. This was primarily directed towards its success in Congress, which they now had direct access to due to the role of their new leader, Ernest Gibson, as Senator of Vermont. In 1941, Gibson presented their position in a statement of support for the bill before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Previous to this, he had endorsed the bill in spite of its implications on Presidential power, stating that \\"only large powers will serve to meet the growing threat to our safety.” Meanwhile, Eichelberger used a radio debate against 1936 Republican presidential nominee Alf Landon to appeal for bipartisan support for the bill. The CDAAA, again, provided legal support for the Lend-Lease bill. The group released a statement by George Rublee, one of the signatories of the New York Times letter of the previous August, that specifically opposed the dictatorship charges made in the minority report of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It states that “the Bill of Rights will still operate. This measure does not add to the powers the President already has as Commander in Chief of the Nation’s armed forces, and under which powers he could get us into war today, if he wanted to.” This help facilitated the passage of the Lend-Lease bill through Congress, which was signed into law by Roosevelt on 11th March 1941. As the passage of the Lend-Lease bill ensured maximum aid to the Allies, the CDAAA had largely fulfilled its objectives of obtaining Allied support short of war.  Opposition  The CDAAA competed for American sympathy with the America First Committee. Created on 4th September 1940, it was the main pressure group supporting complete neutrality and non-intervention. On occasion, the CDAAA was accused of being a British front by its rivals. After the release of the “Stop Hitler Now” advertisement, Democratic West Virginia senator Rush Holt claimed that its funding was sourced from industrialists, international lawyers, international bankers and directors of corporations in Britain. This painted the committee as a tool of big business and, thus, drove the CDAAA to provide the Department of State with details of those who had contributed financially to the advertisement’s publication and reprinting. This ensured that the “Stop Hitler Now” piece had been funded by “100% American sources.” In September 1941, the CDAAA were criticised for having close British connections in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article by Charles Ross. The story accused committee member John L. Balderson of frequent contact with the British embassy, Senator Holt highlighted Balderston’s role, stating that he “is not interested in preserving America but is directly under the British Ministry of Information.” As a result, Balderson was forced to step back from the CDAAA. When the No Foreign War Committee organized in mid- December 1940, its chair, Verne Marshall, said its mission was to counter the \\"propaganda\\" of the CDAAA, which had, he said, \\"the same public psychology as that which was carefully created during the war period preceding our declaration of hostilities in April 1917.\\" He said his group aimed to force the CDAAA to provide details \\"specific, exact, and unequivocal\\" of what it meant when it called for \\"steps short of war.\\"  William A. White's Resignation  In late 1940, there were reports of differences of opinion in the group's leadership after White made remarks that some thought to be at odds with the CDAAA program. He said: \\"The only reason in God's world I am in this organization is to keep the country out of war.... If I were making a motto for the Committee it would be 'The Yanks Are Not Coming.'\\" New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia wrote White a letter of protest, accusing him of \\"doing a Laval.\\" This referred to French minister of state Pierre Laval, the principal figure in France's Vichy government's co-operation with Germany. Herbert Bayard Swope supported the mayor and said that the organization as a whole, despite what White had said, takes as its priority \\"all possible aid to Britain and the allies.\\" Meanwhile, the national director denied any differences and said everyone in the group supported Lend-Lease and opposed both appeasement and a negotiated peace. He quoted and endorsed White's statement: \\"appeasement is treason to democracy.\\" The America First Committee capitalised upon these differences. Robert E. Wood suggested White’s statement offered a basis for national unity, as his remarks \\"essential[ly] agreement with our position.” On 2 January 1941, William A. White resigned as chairman of the CDAAA. White cited his age as his reason for resigning. Ernest W. Gibson Jr. succeeded White as national chairman in January 1941.  Campaign to Defend America and its decline  After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the CDAAA dropped \\"by Aiding the Allies\\" from their name and became simply the Committee to Defend America (CDA). This was caused by the strong aversion from committee members to embracing Joseph Stalin and communism, who were now part of the Allied forces against the Axis Powers. The CDA maintained its official anti-communist stance in spite of American cooperation with the USSR. The Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 effectively brought an end to the CDA by bringing America into war; this also marked the dissolution of the America First Committee. In January 1942, the CDA merged with the Council for Democracy to form Citizens for Victory: To Win the War, To Win the Peace. The combined organization then dissolved in October 1942, marking the official cessation of the CDAAA.

Blackburn. It was introduced on ABC's television series Disneyland, in the premiere episode of October 27, 1954. Fess Parker is shown performing the song on a log cabin set in frontiersman clothes, accompanied by similarly attired musicians. The song would later be heard throughout the Disneyland television miniseries Davy Crockett, first telecast on December 15, 1954. This version was sung by The Wellingtons. Parker played the role of Davy Crockett in the miniseries and continued in four other episodes made by Walt Disney Studios. Buddy Ebsen co-starred as George \\"Georgie\\" Russel, and Jeff York played legendary boatman Mike Fink. Archie Bleyer, the president of Cadence Records, heard the song on the ABC telecast (December 15, 1954) and called Bill Hayes that night to gauge his interest in recording it. The next day, Hayes (vocals), Al Caiola (guitar), and Art Ryerson (guitar) recorded it in one take at an RCA studio in Manhattan. Other versions by Fess ParkerDAVY CROCKETT (TV 1954) George Bruns – Recordman #110 and Tennessee Ernie Ford (recorded on February 7, 1955) quickly followed. All three versions made the Billboard magazine charts in 1955: Hayes' version made #1 on the weekly chart (from March 26 through April 23) and #7 for the year, Parker's reached #6 on the weekly charts and #31 for the year, while Ford's peaked at #4 on the weekly country chart and #5 on the weekly pop chart and charted at #37 for the year. A fourth version, by bluegrass singer Mac Wiseman, reached #10 on the radio charts in May 1955.Billboard, May 28, 1955, Most Played By Jockeys, p. 58 The song also reached #1 on the Cash Box charts, from March 26 through May 14, 1955. A contemporary version also exists by Western singing group the Sons of the Pioneers. Over ten million copies of the song were sold. Reporter-News Online: Texas News – The life, legend of Davy Crockett Louis Armstrong also recorded the song in 1968. In the United Kingdom, Hayes' version reached #2 in the New Musical Express chart; Ford's version achieved #3, and a version by UK singer Max Bygraves reached #20. Several other British artistes recorded versions in 1955 and 1956, including Billy Cotton, Gary Miller, Ronnie Ronalde, and Dick James. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.  The Crockett craze  Walt Disney Productions launched a massive marketing campaign in the UK in 1955 to publicize the film Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (released in Britain in 1956) and to make the country's youth \\"Crockett conscious\\". There was already a \\"Crockett craze\\" in the U.S., where the episodes had become wildly popular. Crockett merchandise was produced en masse, the most iconic item being the imitation coonskin cap. The craze became immensely popular amongst schoolchildren, and the ballad made its way across the Atlantic Ocean.Opie, The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren A French version by Annie Cordy was number 1 for 5 weeks in France in August 1956. United States Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee wore a Davy Crockett cap during the 1956 campaign, as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Adlai Stevenson and Kefauver lost in the general election to incumbents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. The Crockett phenomenon is referenced in books of the time such as Back in the Jug Agane, one of the Molesworth series by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle. The craze was referenced in the film Back to the Future, which is set predominantly in 1955. In the film, the Fess Parker version of the song is heard on a jukebox inside Lou's Diner and, in a later scene, one of Lorraine Baines' brothers appears wearing a coonskin cap. The song is sung by the characters Henry and Sammy in the Country Bear Jamboree. The 2009 film Fantastic Mr. Fox opens with the eponymous fox playing the song on his belt radio. Parodies Several parodies were issued in 1955, including \\"Duvid Crockett\\" by Mickey Katz; \\"Pancho Lopez\\" by Eduardo Lalo Guerrero; \\"Ole Svenson\\" by Yogi Yorgesson; and \\"The Ballad of Davy Crew-Cut\\" by Homer and Jethro. In the South Park episode \\"Raising the Bar\\", James Cameron plays the song during his underwater voyage to literally \\"raise the bar\\" for morality's sake, except this version replaces Davy Crockett with James Cameron himself, therefore being a parody.

It was hosted by Tom Kennedy, with Jamie Farr substituting for Kennedy for one week of shows, and announced by Charlie O'Donnell. The show was produced by Scotti Vinnedge Television in association with Fiedler/Berlin Productions and Rick Ambrose Television. When it premiered on December 29, 1986 Wordplay was slotted in the 12:30 pm/11:30 am timeslot following Super Password. That slot had been occupied by the soap opera Search for Tomorrow for over four and a half years on NBC; the serial had aired continuously, first on CBS, since 1951 and was the longest running daytime program in history at the time of its cancellation. Main game Two contestants, one usually a returning champion, competed through three rounds to win money by guessing the definitions of unusual words. The gameboard consisted of a 3-by-3 grid of words, with the middle column shifted one level above the others. The contestant in control chose a word, and three celebrity panelists each gave a possible definition with an accompanying humorous anecdote. Panelists were provided with definitions before the show.Disclaimer present in the closing credits of every single Wordplay episode, beginning with the premiere on December 29, 1986; \\"Celebrities were furnished definitions in advance\\". If the contestant chose the correct definition, he/she won money; an incorrect choice gave the opponent a chance to steal the value with a correct guess. Two words were played per round, with each contestant choosing one. The champion (or the contestant on the left, if there was no returning champion) played first in round one, the challenger in round two, and the trailing contestant (or, in case of a tie, the left contestant) in round three. Words were worth $25, $50, or $75 in round one; these values doubled in round two, and again in round three. Every word was horizontally and vertically connected to its immediate neighbors. Guessing a correct definition won not only the money for that word, but also the total of all values to which it was connected. For example, a $75 word connected to an already-defined $50 word would award $125 to the contestant who won it ($75 + $50). If a $150 word connected to either of these two values was guessed in a later round, it would award $275 ($150 + $75 + $50). If both contestants missed a word, a block was placed on the board in that location and all connections to it were broken. One word per game was designated as the day's bonus word. Choosing this word and guessing its definition correctly awarded a bonus prize to the contestant, usually if not always a vacation, which was his/hers to keep regardless of the game's outcome. The contestant with the higher total after three rounds advanced to the bonus round. If the game ended in a tie, a seventh word was played, selected by the champion (or the contestant on the left). Each celebrity gave a brief definition with no accompanying story, and the champion had the option to either play the word or pass it to the challenger. A correct guess won the game, while an incorrect guess gave the victory to the opponent. Double Definitions The day's champion advanced to the Double Definitions bonus round for an accumulating cash jackpot. The round was originally titled \\"Speedword\\" for the first week, but was quickly changed once the producers realized that fellow NBC game show Scrabble had been using the term for more than two years at the time. The gameboard for this round was a grid of 24 numbered spaces, in four rows of six, with each space vertically and horizontally connected to its immediate neighbors. When the champion called a number, Kennedy read two definitions for a word (such as \\"Writing Implement/Animal Enclosure\\" for the word \\"pen\\"). Guessing the word awarded control of that space, while passing put up a block that the champion would have to go around. Multiple guesses were allowed with no penalty; the champion could move off a space only by giving a correct response or passing. The champion had 45 seconds to complete a path connecting the left and right sides of the board. Doing so won the jackpot, which began at $5,000 and increased by $2,500 for every day it went unclaimed. Failing to complete the path won $100 per correct answer. The largest jackpot awarded on the show was $27,500, which occurred during the final week on the air.Wordplay episode 178, aired September 2, 1987. Contestants were allowed to stay for three consecutive days or until they were defeated, whichever came first. Broadcast history Wordplay premiered on December 29, 1986, three days after the finale of Search for Tomorrow, and inherited the soap opera's 12:30 p.m. Eastern timeslot. The series faced off against the first half-hour of the highly-rated The Young and the Restless on CBS and Loving on ABC, and did not perform well against both soap operas. NBC announced the cancellation of Wordplay in the summer of 1987 in order to make room for Win, Lose or Draw on the network's schedule; the final episode of the series aired on September 4, 1987. Three days after the final episode aired, Scrabble was moved to the 12:30 p.m. Eastern timeslot. The series exists in its entirety and is in the possession of Fremantle, which inherited the rights to the series from its predecessor company Pearson Television, which in turn acquired those rights through the acquisition of Scotti Vinnedge Productions' parent All American Television. Prior to 2017, Wordplay had not been seen on television since its cancellation by NBC, but episodes circulated on YouTube through private collectors. Additionally, the series was one of six considered for a Sunday night slot on Buzzr called \\"Pick & Play\\" in the fall of 2015, but failed to generate enough votes from viewers to make it on the schedule. The series was later set to begin airing regularly on Buzzr two years later, in September 2017, only to be pulled by the channel after two days and replaced by Match Game. The pilot episode, shot in October 1986 for NBC, featuring Peter Tomarken as host and Rod Roddy as announcer, also exists. Highlights from the pilot were featured by Wink Martindale as part of his ongoing \\"Wink's Vault\\" series on YouTube, and it was later shown in its entirety as part of a Buzzr \\"Lost and Found\\" marathon in September 2017. This episode features a different layout for the word grid (a 4-by-3 rectangle with three blocks already in place) and a different theme song. The pilot theme was Hitting Home, composed by British composers David Reilly & John Devereaux and released as part of the KPM Music library.

She first appeared in Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th (1980) as the vengeful mother of Jason Voorhees, and was simply known as Mrs. Voorhees. The character was created by Victor Miller, and was portrayed by Betsy Palmer in the original film, as well as Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981). Pamela was portrayed by Marilyn Poucher in Friday the 13th Part III (1982). She was portrayed by Paula Shaw in Freddy vs. Jason (2003). According to Palmer, she was asked to reprise her role for Freddy vs. Jason but turned it down after reading the script, as she stated in the \\"Friday The 13th Reunion\\". Nana Visitor played Pamela in the 2009 reboot.  Appearances = Films =Friday the 13th Pamela Voorhees during her killing spree. Pamela (whose maiden name is never revealed) was born in 1930 (revealed in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter). At age 15, Pamela became pregnant by a man named Elias Voorhees. Very little is known about their romance and short marriage, aside from the fact that Pamela kept a class ring which she wore on her ring finger of her left hand (as seen in several scenes in the first Friday the 13th film). On June 13, 1946, at age 16, she gave birth to a hydrocephalic boy and she named him Jason, as shown in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. Because of his condition, Pamela never sent Jason to school, and was extremely overprotective of him. Pamela got a job as a cook at Camp Crystal Lake by David and Louise Christy. On a fateful day in 1957, Jason, infuriated by the constant teasing and harassment from other children, snuck out of his cabin late at night to prove that he could swim. The counselors were not watching him at all, as they were at a party and making love in one of the adult cabins. Jason was never recovered from the lake and presumably drowned. Pamela blamed the counselors for his death because she was working the day that it happened. After Jason's death, Pamela began hearing auditory hallucinations and heard her son's voice telling her to kill the people who were responsible for his demise. In 1958, a year after Jason's death, Pamela brutally murdered two counselors (Barry and Claudette) in cold blood without showing any remorse because she believed they were responsible for her son's death. Camp Crystal Lake was closed after the murders and was nicknamed \\"Camp Blood\\" by local residents. When the owners tried to re-open the camp in 1962, Pamela returned, poisoned the water, and set several fires - the first film establishes that nobody knew who was responsible for these incidents. The camp was shut down once again, and did not re-open until 17 years later. Pamela lived in a house which bordered the Camp Crystal Lake, which allowed her to observe that the camp remained unattended. On Friday, June 13, 1979, the new owner of Camp Crystal Lake, Steven \\"Steve\\" Christy, and seven young counselors - Annie Phillips, Alice Hardy, Bill Brown, Ned Rubenstein, Marcie Cunningham, Jack Burrell, and Brenda Jones - return to the deadly and dangerous campground to prepare it for reopening, even after several ominous warnings of a death curse by the local residents. Pamela, who does not want the camp re-opened for fear of another tragic accident, is enraged and goes on a savage killing spree: she slashes Annie's throat in the woods with her bowie knife, lures Ned inside a cabin to slit his throat, pierces Jack's throat with an arrow from underneath the bed, slams a felling axe into Marcie's face inside the bathroom stalls, and brutally attacks Brenda at the archery range. When Steve returns to the camp, not knowing of the murders, Pamela shines a flashlight at him before stabbing him in the chest. Bill investigates the generator which has been turned off, and she slits his throat before pinning his body with arrows to the shed door. With Alice as the last remaining counselor, she finds Bill's body and barricades herself in the main cabin. After terrorizing Alice by throwing Brenda's body into one of the windows, she drives her jeep towards the cabin to lure Alice out, thinking Steve has returned. Outside, she greets the frightened Alice in a friendly manner and cites herself as a friend of Steve Christy. When she enters inside the cabin with Alice, she sees Brenda's body and begins to discuss about Jason's drowning in which she blames the counselors for not paying attention to his incident. As she begins to have visions of Jason's drowning, she turns violent and draws her bowie knife to attack Alice, but the surviving counselor strikes her with a fireplace poker. When Alice flees into the gun storage, Pamela violently slaps her before Alice stuns her by smacking the butt of a rifle into her face. As Pamela searches around the camp saying in Jason's voice \\"kill her, mommy!\\", she finds Alice inside a food closet and as she attacks with a machete, Alice renders her unconscious with a frying pan. When she later awakes, she finds Alice at the shore and attacks her once again. During the struggle, Alice gains the upper hand and she finally decapitates Pamela with her own machete, killing her. Her hands unnaturally clutch in the air before she finally dies. Later films Two months later, a mysteriously revived Jason carries out his own revenge by killing Alice. Jason had kept his mother's severed head, using it to frighten Alice by placing it in her refrigerator - before taking it along with his mother's corpse to his shack deep in the woods. The shack contains a shrine Jason has built for his mother, and he also stores the bodies of some of his victims there. After he is hit in the shoulder with a machete (the same machete with which Pamela was killed) and left for dead at the end of his first killing spree, he leaves his crudely-made home and his mother. Pamela Voorhees is initially laid to rest in a run down, roadside cemetery seen in The Final Chapter. When Jason is killed by Tommy Jarvis a few years later, it is presumed that her body is relocated to Eternal Peace Cemetery along with her son. Although Pamela does not share her son's immortality, she does reappear in later films. The character is seen again in the climax of Friday the 13th Part 2 in which Betsy Palmer reprises her role when Jason sees his mother talking to him but it is one of Jason's potential victims trying to fool him. In the final scene, her mummified head is portrayed by actress Connie Hogan in makeup - originally intended for a deleted scene showing her opening her eyes and smiling. Pamela is seen again in Friday the 13th Part III when lone survivor Chris Higgins has a nightmare which ends with Pamela's corpse (played by the Second Assistant Director, Marilyn Poucher), wearing her blue sweater with head attached, reaching up from the lake to pull her under. She is seen again in Freddy vs. Jason (played this time by Paula Shaw), seen in Hell commanding her son to kill the children of Elm Street; however, it turns out that it is actually Freddy Krueger masquerading as Pamela in order to manipulate Jason for his own ends. Pamela appears very briefly in the more recent Friday the 13th reboot in the beginning credits chasing a young girl (presumably Alice). She is decapitated, as in the original film, and a young Jason Voorhees finds a locket containing pictures of him and his mother. Jason hears her voice telling him to \\"kill for mother.\\" In an interview, John Carl Buechler revealed he had originally intended to have a scene in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood in which heroine Tina Shepard has a surreal vision in which Pamela's severed head appears in Jason's arms, repeatedly yelling \\"help me mommy!\\" The scene was never shot, due to being deemed too over-the-top. Reportedly, the character was to make another appearance for Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday in a flashback.Pit Of Horror.com - Interviews Jason X was originally meant to feature an appearance of Pamela in the holographic projection of Camp Crystal Lake that Jason is distracted by in the film; one idea was to even have Jason attack the virtual Pamela to show just how evil he had become. = Literature = The cover of Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale #1, which reveals much of Pamela's early life, such as her pregnancy with her son Jason. The severed head of Pamela Voorhees is a major character in the first book of Eric Morse's Camp Crystal Lake series. In the novel, hunter Joe Travers finds an unmarked gravestone in the forest and digs nearby to find a wet cardboard box containing the still living head, having been reanimated by Jason's cursed mask. Pamela then gives him directions to the location of Jason's buried hockey mask, which he digs up and puts on, thus becoming possessed by Jason in the process. Carly, the novel's heroine, later discovers the head still in its box, still in the grave. During the final showdown with Pamela and the hunter, she destroys the head with a shotgun blast, killing Pamela. In the non-canonical Jason vs. Leatherface comic miniseries by Topps Comics, Mrs. Voorhees is identified as Doris and appears in two flashbacks, one in the first issue and another in the second; in the first flashback, brought on by Jason being asked his name by Cook, she appears, face obscured, encouraging a young Jason as he writes his name on a chalkboard. The second flashback, provoked by Jason seeing the Hitchhiker abuse his younger brother Leatherface, has her killing Elias Voorhees with a machete when he attempts to beat Jason. The comic one-shot Jason X Special by Avatar Press features Pamela coming back from the dead by possessing a swarm of nano ants. Discovering Jason has been captured by a bio-engineer named Kristen, Pamela releases him and guides him to a camp near Kristen's laboratory populated by androids, who Jason begins to destroy, quickly becoming disastified with these victims due to the fact that, as Pamela states, \\"they aren't real.\\" At the end of the comic, Pamela, after Jason is launched into space by Kristen, gets revenge on the bio-engineer by possessing her lover Neil and forcing him to stab Kristen in the stomach and slit his own throat. In the sequel to the one-shot, the two-issue miniseries Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X, Pamela appears only as a fragmented memory shared between Jason and his clone (which was created using a portion of Jason's brain). After Jason disposes of his clone and assimilates the portion of his brain it possessed, his memories of Pamela (who he and the clone did not recognize) are restored. In the novel Jason X: Death Moon by Black Flame, a character, while in a holographic version of Crystal Lake, stumbles across an underwater recreation of Pamela's grave in the lake and is attacked by a zombified version of her created by Dr. Armando Castillo. In Friday the 13th: Hell Lake, the character Gretchen Andrews, after an encounter with Jason, seemingly becomes possessed by Pamela. Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs involves Pamela possessing characters who come into contact with her severed head. In 2007, a two issue comic miniseries titled Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale, detailing much of Pamela's history, was printed by Wildstorm; the comics take place before the main events of Friday the 13th and feature Pamela picking up Annie, one of the Camp Crystal Lake counselors in-training, and recounting her past. She reveals that Elias abused her while she was pregnant, which may have caused Jason to be born deformed. Driven by what she believed to be the unborn Jason's voice, Pamela killed Elias with an axe, blew up their trailer and dumped her husband's body in Crystal Lake. After killing Elias, Pamela moved to Crystal Lake and got a job as a chef at a diner, later being hired as Camp Crystal Lake's cook by the Christy family. After telling Annie her origin Pamela, as in the film, slits her throat, but treats her body as if it were still alive afterwards. The miniseries ends with a recreation of the scene from the film where Pamela meets Alice at Camp Crystal Lake. In the two- issue miniseries Friday the 13th: How I Spent My Summer Vacation, Pamela appears in a flashback to when she first brought Jason to Camp Crystal Lake in the first issue and the end of the second issue has Jason visiting his mother's grave. In the first issue of the six-issue comic book miniseries Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, in a dream of Jason's, Freddy Krueger creates a vision of Pamela and uses it to manipulate Jason into seeking out the Necronomicon that is in the house that he and Pamela lived in when he was a child, as seen in the movie Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday. In the fifth issue of the miniseries, in addition to there being a portrait of Pamela in her and Jason's old house, it is implied that she used the Necronomicon to resurrect Jason after he drowned in Crystal Lake.  Other media  Pamela also appears in the Friday The 13th video game for the NES. Her severed head is a mini-boss in a hidden cave. It floats around after lifting itself off a pedestal surrounded by candles, reminiscent of the second movie. Just as Jason has to be defeated three times to complete the game, Pamela can also be fought three times, and each defeat earns the player a unique item — a powerful weapon (usually a machete or axe), then her sweater, and finally the pitchfork. In the Friday The 13th video game titled Friday The 13th: The Game, made by Gun Media and Illfonic, Pamela (whether it's the real Pamela or a figment of Jason's imagination is unknown), voiced by Jennifer Ann Burton, tells Jason to kill the camp counselors that have come to Camp Crystal Lake. In the game, there are 2 series of unlockable audio tapes, one of which follows Pamela after Jason's drowning, and the other of which follows Tommy Jarvis after the events of the 4th, 5th, and 6th films of the Friday The 13th film series. Pamela's tapes offer background information on Pamela and Jason's life before the latter's drowning, revealing that Jason was not actually the son of Elias Voorhees, but the product of a brutal rape by an unknown stranger. Pamela and Jason were heavily abused by Elias, culminating in Pamela murdering her husband. When questioned by the police on the murder, Pamela claims that she did on Jason's urging. The tapes also feature a brief, friendly exchange between Pamela and Dr. Malcolm Jarvis, the father of Jason's future nemesis Tommy Jarvis, who sympathizes with Pamela. Action figures of Pamela have been released by both Sideshow Collectibles and NECA.

He was appointed a lord of session from 1611–26, with the judicial title Lord Newton and was Lord Advocate from 1612 to 1626. He was appointed a member of new High Commission court in 1615. He was responsible for the present procedure of examining witnesses in court. He seems to have been involved in witch trials.

He was chosen, with Thomas Craig, to defend the six ministers in January 1606; but he gave up his brief on the eve of the trial, on the plea, as Balmerino explained, that the king’s promise of leniency, provided they acknowledge their offense, not justify their obstinacy (ib. vii. 478). He thereby was the won the king's favour, and was soon amply rewarded. In 1608 the council, in a letter to the king, named him first of four who were ‘the most learned and best experienced of their profession’ (Denmylne MSS. A. 2. 39. No. 66). In November 1610 he appears as a justice of the peace for Perthshire and the stewartries of Strathearn and Menteith (Reg. of Privy Council, ix. 78). He was elevated to the bench in January 1611, in succession to Sir David Lindsay of Edzell, one of the lords- ordinary. Thereupon the privy council wrote a long letter to the king, in which they declared how popular had been the election of one ‘whose bipast cariage is an hes bene onlie forceable to hold him in your Majesteis rememberance’ (ib. ix. 592). Next year (19 June) he was nominated in a royal letter as king's advocate, in succession to Hamilton, who had been appointed clerk of register. On 9 July following be was admitted of the privy council as lord-advocate, and was nighted by the chancellor in conformity with a mandate from the king. He retained his seat on the bench (ib. ix. 403). Parliament ratified his appointment in October, and granted a pension of 1,000l. for life, which the king had intimated to the council in a letter of 8 April 1611. He played a prominent part in the political stir of the closing years of James's reign ; the sederunts of the privy council show that he was present at almost every meeting. In December 1612 he was one of a select commission of five for the settling of controversies between burgh and landward justices of the peace (ib. ix. 503) ; in August 1613 a commissioner for the trial of the Jesuit Robert Philip, in December 1614 for the trial of Father John Ogilvie [q.v.], and in June 1015 for that of James Mofiat; in December 1615 he was appointed a member of the reconstructed court of high commission, and in May 1616 one of the committee to report on the book 'God and the King,' which James had determined to introduce into Scotland as he had done in England and Ireland. On 17 Dec. 1016 Oliphant was elected a member of the financial committee of the council known as the commissioners for the king's rents (ib. x. 676 ; Balfour, Annals, ii. 65). As kind's advocate he appears in all the great political trials, notably those of Gordon of Gicht and Sir James Macdonald of Islay. He had the care, too, of putting into force the new acts against the sale of tobacco and the carrying of hagbuts ; and the numerous prosecutions which he carried out testify to his activity. The parliament of 1021 ratified the possession of the family lands to him and his sons James and William in fee {Acts of Parl. iv. 662). Charles I's proclamation prohibiting the holding of an ordinary seat in the court of session by officers of state and nobles compelled him to leave the bench (February 1020). He died on 1 (13?) April 1628, and was buried in the Greyfriars' churchyard at Edinburgh. To Oliphant is due the present procedure of examining witnesses in the hearing of the jury. Hitherto evidence had been taken in the trial of one Listen, accused of the murder of a certain John Mayne (Pitcairn).

In early 2009 he returned to TNA under the ring name Sally Boy, or simply Sal, as one half of The Main Event Mafia's, and later Mick Foley's, personal security force. Sassi trained current AEW wrestler and executive Cody Rhodes. Career Sassi graduated from Miramar High School in 1988, and turned down academic scholarships in order to train as a wrestler, financing his training through a series of odd jobs, including waiting tables in Hollywood Florida at Napoli's Italian restaurant, formerly run by his father-in-law Paul. Sassi made his wrestling debut on September 30, 1988. In 1990, Sassi appeared with the Nashville-based NWA Worldwide Wrestling. Sassi eventually began wrestling primarily on the Floridian independent circuit, where he formed a tag team with \\"Brother\\" Dan Evans. Evans and Sassi used the gimmick of a pair of boisterous, prank playing fraternity members. After Evans retired due to injury, Sassi continued to use the gimmick with the third part of the team, Big Tilly. Sassi and Tilly were known collectively as Phi Delta Slam. =World Wrestling Federation= Sassi also had several matches with World Wrestling Federation from 1994 to 2000. His final and most notable match for the WWF occurred on April 15, 2000 when he lost to Stevie Richards on an episode of Jakked. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005, 2007, 2009-2010)= Phi Delta Slam were introduced to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) after Dusty Rhodes told his two competing assistants, Traci Brooks and Trinity, to each find a tag team. The tag teams would wrestle one another at Destination X, with the winning tag team's sponsor becoming Rhodes' sole assistant. Trinity selected Phi Delta Slam, and they debuted in February 2005, wrestling dark matches. They made their on- screen debut on March 13 at Destination X, where they lost to Traci's choice, The Harris Brothers. Phi Delta Slam remained in TNA for several weeks afterwards. Tilly and Sassi later made a cameo appearance in a series of comedy segments on the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact! where they were seen at Eric Young's Christmas party, which also involved the likes of Bushwhacker Butch, Kevin Nash, ODB, and Awesome Kong. Return In early 2009, both Tilly and Sassi returned to TNA as the personal security of The Main Event Mafia in order to help them fend off The TNA Front Line. In order play into the mafia aspect of the stable, Sassi was renamed to Sal (it was later tweaked to Sally Boy), he began wearing sunglasses at all times, dyed his normally blond hair to black and began sporting a short beard. On the March 13 edition of Impact!, Sal and Kurt Angle accompanied Rocco as he wrestled Frontline member Eric Young in the main event, which Rocco lost after Young pinned him following a Death Valley driver. On the April 2 edition of Impact!, Rocco and Sal challenged and lost to Team 3D. On the May 7 edition of Impact! they were defeated in a handicap match by Matt Morgan. On the May 28 edition of Impact! Sting, the new leader of the Main Event Mafia, fired Sal and Rocco. On the June 4, 2009, edition of Impact! Rocco and Sal were hired by Mick Foley. The two of them have since made sporadic appearances as bodyguards. =Independent circuit= Phi Delta Slam is currently wrestling with the South Florida-based Coastal Championship Wrestling. In addition, all three members of Phi Delta Slam (Sassi, Tilly and Evans) operate a professional wrestling school called Bodyslam University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Notable graduates include former WWE United States and WWE Tag Team Champion Montel Vontavious Porter.

Shut Your Mouth (known as Exciting Pro Wrestling 4 in Japan) is a professional wrestling video game released on the PlayStation 2 console by THQ and developed by Yuke's. It is part of the WWE SmackDown! video game series based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). This game was the sequel to WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It and was succeeded by WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain. It is also the first game in the series named under the \\"WWE\\" banner. Gameplay Season mode was lengthened to two in-game years and features the Brand Extension featuring Ric Flair's Raw and Vince McMahon's SmackDown! For the first time, only WWE superstars could participate in \\"season mode\\". Players compete exclusively on the show they are drafted to for the first few months of year one, consisting of four Raw or four SmackDown! events, plus a monthly pay-per-view (PPV) event. If the player's character is a created superstar, or if the original superstar has a rating lower than 60, he will instead wrestle on Sunday Night HEAT. Eventually, the player will be booked on the two major TV shows, appearing on two Raw and two SmackDown! shows and the PPV event. One of the featured storylines is based on the nWo of early 2002 that included Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and X-Pac (who replaced the released Scott Hall). Like its predecessor WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, Shut Your Mouth's championships cannot be contended for in \\"exhibition mode\\" and can only be defended in \\"season mode\\". All of the major titles of the time, except for the WWE Women's Championship, are included in the game: WWE Undisputed, Intercontinental, European, Tag Team, Cruiserweight, and Hardcore championships. Various unlockables such as alternate player attires, extra movesets, and arenas be unlocked through \\"season mode\\". Televised and pay-per-view events are televised from the SmackDown! Arena, the exterior of which is based on Madison Square Garden. Although Jim Ross announces a different city at the start of each event, the exteriors remain the same. Notable areas are a New York City Subway stop named SmackDown! Station, Times Square, and The World. The game features several arenas that WWE held events at in 2001 and 2002. There are also arenas based on each WWE television show. In certain arenas, players could make their wrestlers scale the TitanTron and jump off of it. In addition, The Undertaker's motorcycle could be ridden in some matches. \\"Create-A-Superstar mode\\" gives the freedom to manipulate any part of the superstar's body. It also offers over 58 move sets from a combination of superstars in WWE not featured in the game or working in different promotions. This is the first game to feature superstars on different brands, Raw and SmackDown!. In this game, all the superstars, including champions are eligible to be drafted on both brands, except for the WWE Undisputed Champion, who is available on both brands, as long as he is the champion. This also marks the first WWE video game appearances of Billy Kidman, Brock Lesnar, Chuck Palumbo, Diamond Dallas Page, Jazz, Maven, Randy Orton, Rico, and Torrie Wilson.  Development  Superstar models include realistic facial features. Fully animated entrances for each character are featured, with their entrance video playing on the TitanTron, and their respective themes playing in the arena. The title belts are also displayed in the entrances realistically (e.g. The Rock carrying the title belt to the ring and raising it above his head). For superstar entrances, most of the themes used in the televised and house shows were incorporated into the game. Along with the in-house music from Jim Johnston, remakes of Johnston's originals from bands such as Breaking Point (for Rob Van Dam), Boy Hits Car (for Lita), Cypress Hill (for Tazz), Our Lady Peace (for Chris Benoit), and Saliva (for The Dudley Boyz) were featured. However, Maven, Stacy Keibler, Tajiri, Randy Orton, and The Hardy Boyz do not have their correct themes (although an instrumental version of Maven's actual entrance theme is included on the game disc). Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler provide sporadic commentary while ring announcer Howard Finkel provided his voice for match introductions and superstar entrances. Reception By July 2006, the game had sold 1.1 million copies and earned $50 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 44th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2003 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of WWE games released in the 2000s reached 8 million units in the United States by July 2006. It also received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Shut Your Mouth"},{"id":"2275062","text":"Vertical Man is the 11th studio album by Ringo Starr, issued in 1998. The album served as Starr's attempt at a commercial comeback following the enormous success of The Beatles Anthology project. Starr enlisted the help of many of his musician friends in making Vertical Man, including Scott Weiland, Brian Wilson, Alanis Morissette, Ozzy Osbourne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit, Steven Tyler, and former Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick mixed the tracks, and Starr and Mark Hudson served as producers. Background and recording Ringo Starr met songwriter Dean Grakal at a party on New Year's Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on Time Takes Time (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process in an interview with Billboard magazine: \\"This is the first time I've really been involved [in my record]. Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say what I would have liked to say, on this, we're really trying to say what I want to say, thank you.\\" In February 1997, Hudson and Grakal visited Starr in his Beverly Hills residence for a songwriting session. The result of this meeting was a song called \\"My Love\\", which was promptly renamed to \\"Everyday\\" after Starr commented that McCartney had already used the title. The song was demoed under that name by Starr, Hudson, Grakal, and guitarist Steve Dudas. Happy with this session, the quartet followed it up with more recordings the following month, at Los Angeles's Whatinthewhatthe? Studios. There the musicians recorded two tracks: \\"Mr. Double-It-Up\\" and \\"One\\", the latter of which, per Grakal's lyric sheet, was originally called \\"All It Takes Is One\\". For these sessions, Starr played the drum set he had used during his time with the Beatles. In mid-to-late April, Starr and Hudson worked on Vertical Man as Starr began rehearsals for an upcoming tour. Before embarking on the tour (which would begin on 28 April), Starr recorded \\"I'll Be Fine Anywhere\\". After the tour had finished on 8 June, Starr went on holiday, and returned in July. Recording for the album restarted in the same month, on 20 July, with Starr playing with the Roundheads as his backing band. Starr and the Roundheads recorded the tracks \\"What in the... World\\", \\"La De Da\\", and \\"Mindfield\\" on 20 July at Whatinthewhatthe? Studios. Starr added vocals to \\"What in the... World\\" on 28 July, and two days later to \\"Without Understanding\\". On July 31, Joe Walsh showed up at Whatinthewhatthe? Studios and added guitar parts to \\"What in the... World\\", \\"La De Da\\" and \\"Mindfield\\". The next day, Starr re-recorded his \\"Without Understanding\\" vocal. On 5 August, the track \\"Old Country Song\\" (soon to be re-titled as \\"Good News\\") was recorded. The bass track to \\"Good News\\" was recorded two days later, by Lee Rocker. Starr and Hudson then flew to Europe at the end of August. On 29 September, at McCartney's The Mill studio, McCartney, Starr, Hudson, Emerick and Paul Wright worked on the track \\"La De Da\\", which McCartney contributed bass and backing vocals to. This session was filmed by Grakal, and excerpts were later featured in the music video for the song. Also recorded was a new bass track for \\"What in the... World\\"-- replacing the placeholder bass track from a July session. Upon hearing a playback of the track, McCartney remarked \\"Whoo ... Rich! Sounds kinda Beatle-ish!\\" to which Starr replied \\"I know! That's what I said to Mark months ago\\". McCartney, now looking at Starr, told him \\"You are a fucking Beatle!\\" On 15 October, the same day Starr was in Paris to watch McCartney's daughter Stella's fashion show, string overdubs were added on to \\"I'm Yours\\" and \\"King of Broken Hearts\\" at AIR Studios, located in London. Starr returned to Los Angeles on 1 November to add overdubs to the latest recorded material, and on 3 November, he recorded \\"I Was Walkin'\\". On November 4th, \\"The Puppet Song\\" was recorded. The song had originated from a comment by Starr (\\"Put the puppet to bed\\"), and would be renamed to \\"Puppet\\". On 6 November, \\"Sometimes\\" was recorded, which contained a riff taken from Ringo's Rotogravure's (1976) \\"Cryin'\\". On November 7th, Jeff Baxter overdubbed a steel guitar onto \\"One\\" and \\"Sometimes\\". On the same day, Jim Cox added keyboard overdubs to several songs; Starr originally wanted Billy Preston to play the keyboards, but he was in jail at the time. On November 11th at Village Recorder Studios, Baxter also added keyboards to three tracks: \\"I Was Walkin'\\", \\"La De Da\\" and \\"Sometimes\\". Overdubs were added to a number of tracks the following day at the same studio. On November 13th, an ensemble of 45 people--consisting of Starr's friends and family--gathered at Village Recorder Studios to record backing vocals to the track \\"La De Da\\". The following day, both Schmit and Dave Gibbs added backing vocals to \\"Puppet\\" and \\"Sometimes\\". On November 17th, Tyler flew from Amsterdam to Los Angeles to overdub harmonica to both \\"I Was Walkin'\\" and a re-make of \\"Love Me Do\\". The following day, Tyler re-did his harmonica part to \\"Love Me Do\\". This was done at Starr's request, who wanted it to sound closer to the Beatles' original version. On 19 November, Alanis Morissette stopped by Whatinthewhatthe? Studios and recorded a vocal for \\"Drift Away\\". The next day, at Village Recorder Studios, the gospel-choir group Sauce recorded backing vocals for \\"\\"Without Understanding\\" and \\"Drift Away\\". Brian Wilson, as well as Barbara Bach's cousin, Christian Phillippe Quillici, overdubbed backing vocals to \\"Without Understanding\\" on 25 November. Wilson dubbed several backing vocal tracks at Hudson's request. On the same day, Morissette added backing vocals to two tracks: \\"Mindfield\\" and \\"I Was Walkin'\\". Engineer Eric Greedy made two mixes--one with only vocals, and one of the just the backing tracks--of both \\"King of Broken Hearts\\" and \\"I'll Be Fine Anywhere\\". These were sent the next day to Harrison at his Friar Park residence. Up to this point, sixteen tracks in total had been recorded for the album. After arriving in Los Angeles on 30 November, up until 11 December, Geoff Emerick worked on mixing five tracks at A&M; Studios (\\"One\\", \\"Mr. Double-It-Up\\", \\"Everyday\\", \\"I'm Yours\\" and \\"What in the... World\\"). Also on the 11th, minor mixing was conducted on \\"Love Me Do\\". Starr had not paid rent since the beginning of the record sessions. As a result, Nina Pieseckyj--the landlord's secretary--arrived at Whatinthewhatthe? Studios on 12 December to request the rent. Starr immediately asked if she played an instrument, to which she replied \\"Yeah, cello\\". Starr proceeded to tell her to \\"go get it\\". Pieseckyj ended up playing a cello riff similar to \\"I Am the Walrus\\" on the track \\"Vertical Man\\". Also on this day, Starr was announced to have signed with an EMI subsidiary label, Guardian Records, to release his new album on the planned date of 21 April 1998. On 16 December, a final mix of \\"Love Me Do\\" was made. A few days after having been signed to Guardian, the label (along with several other minor labels) was shutdown by then-current EMI president Ken Barry, leaving Starr without a label on which to release the album. Upon finding this out, Starr added a final lead vocal track to \\"Vertical Man\\". All musicians and staff members then took a Christmas break from recording. Harrison's guitar overdubs were sent to Starr via mail and arrived on 22 December, after which he went with the Roundheads to Village Recorder Studios to hear the results. Upon hearing the solos, Starr exclaimed \\"You're killing me, George. You've got me crying, you bugger!\\". Between 6 and 11 January 1998, the tracks \\"Mindfield\\", \\"King of Broken Hearts\\" and \\"Drift Away\\" were mixed at A&M; Studios. Osbourne added a vocal track to \\"Vertical Man\\" on 16 January. The following day at A&M; Studios, saxophonist Joel Peskin overdubbed saxophone onto \\"Puppet\\", which was then mixed on 23 January. On 29 January, Starr and friends listened to a playback of the album. Hudson and Emerick flew to New York on 17 February to oversee mastering of the album. Later that day, Hudson and Grakal met with Mercury's Danny Goldberg, with whom they made a deal to release the album. On 23 April, Starr removed Tyler's vocal at Mercury's request, as Aerosmith was due to have tracks released on the Armageddon soundtrack. Mastering was handled the next day at Masterdisc by Greg Calbi. Final mastering for the album was done from 2 to 6 May at A&M; Studios. On the same day, at Abbey Road Studios, Starr, and Mark and Scott Gordon, via telephone, recorded Petty's (who is assisted by Greedy) vocals for the song \\"Drift Away\\", who was at Village Recorder Studios in Los Angeles. \\"Drift Away\\" was remastered, now with Petty's vocals for the song in the mix, on 12 May. Promotion, release and reception With the recent Beatles Anthology having introduced the group to newer and younger fans, it was reasoned that Starr would benefit from the exposure; McCartney's Flaming Pie had done very well upon its 1997 release. With Starr newly signed to a worldwide major label deal with Mercury, he was hoping for a similar reaction. On both 13 and 14 April 1998, Starr held interviews to help promote the album, which was originally to be titled Thanks for Comin', before being changed after looking through a book belonging to Barbara Bach's daughter, Francesca. On the latter day, a photograph of Starr was taken for the album booklet by Henry Diltz. Starr planned to film a music video for \\"La De Da\\" at Shea Stadium in New York, though when the scheduled day arrived, filming was disrupted due to rain. As a result, filming moved to the streets of New York City, where Starr was shot sitting on a bench with an umbrella. The video is intercut with Starr and his backing band performing the song, along with footage of McCartney singing the chorus from the previous September. The original plan was for Starr to conduct a crowd singing one verse from \\"La De Da\\". On 14 May, in the US, Mercury sent out Electronic press kits (EPKs) for the album. On 18 May, Entertainment Tonight aired an interview with McCartney and Starr that was filmed during the sessions at McCartney's home studio. The \\"La De Da\\" video first aired on MTV in Europe, on 19 May, while in the US, the video aired on Entertainment Tonight on 25 May. On 1 June, radio stations were sent promotional copies of the single. A radio special, on 15 June, premiered the album worldwide. Interviews with Starr about the album were printed in both New Yorker and USA Today newspapers. Vertical Man was released on 16 June in the US, with \\"La De Da\\" released as a single on 20 July before being withdrawn a week later. Those who pre-ordered the album with Best Buy were given a three-track bonus CD of material not included on the album. Starr also arranged for a digipak edition--limited to 100,000 copies--to be released. The German version of the album included the bonus track \\"Mr. Double-It-Up\\", while the Japanese edition contained \\"Mr. Double-It-Up\\" and \\"Everyday\\". Attendees at the Beatlefest convention who had pre-ordered the album were given a 7\\" single of \\"La De Da\\", which included a non-album track \\"Everyday\\" as the B-side. Vertical Man received average reviews and reached No. 61 in the US. The album was then released in the UK on 3 August, where it bubbled below the official Top 75, reaching No. 85 there, after having sold 2,000 copies. Within the album's week of release, Starr held an online chat with fans. A tour followed the release of the album, although Starr said the tour was not only to promote the album: \\"I don't really ever want to do the two hours where it's just me. I like the mixture of the All-Stars because it's so much fun.\\" On 5 April 1999, Hudson and Gordon made a single edit version of \\"La De Da\\", which Starr approved on 9 June. Nearly a month later, on 4 July, the single edit aired for the first time on British airwaves, thanks to The Chart Show.

Woodin is a managing editor of the Journal of Mathematical Logic. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. He is the great-grandson of William Hartman Woodin, former Secretary of the Treasury. Work He has done work on the theory of generic multiverses and the related concept of Ω-logic, which suggested an argument that the continuum hypothesis is either undecidable or false in the sense of mathematical platonism. Woodin criticizes this view arguing that it leads to a counterintuitive reduction in which all truths in the set theoretical universe can be decided from a small part of it. He claims that these and related mathematical results lead (intuitively) to the conclusion that Continuum Hypothesis has a truth value and the Platonistic approach is reasonable. Woodin now predicts that there should be a way of constructing an inner model for almost all known large cardinals, which he calls the Ultimate L and which would have similar properties as Gödel's constructible universe. In particular, the Continuum Hypothesis would be true in this universe.

He is considered the founder of the \\"Greater East Asia\\" concept. Satō attempted to synthesize Western science (especially Astronomy) with Japanese political and philosophical thought. His ideas contributed to the early modern consolidation of the religion of Shinto, especially in the form of State Shinto. In his 1825 treatise Tenchūku, Satō argued that the cosmology in the Kojiki was both indigenous to Japan and the most compatible of all world religions with astronomy. He extended the Western model, however, by arguing that Shinto provided additional explanations for astronomical phenomenon that had not yet been explained by Western astronomy. Satō advocated an authoritarian government based on Western science and political institutions. In his Keizai yōryaku (The Epitome of Economy), he wrote that \\"The rationale of economy is to manage the realm, develop goods, make domains affluent, and succor everyone.\\" Satō considered the European great powers to be a threat that Japan needed to counter by radical economic and military reforms, as well as imperial expansion along European lines. His 1823 work A Secret Strategy for Expansion（宇内混同秘策） called for Japanese world domination, describing how China should be conquered via Manchuria. He suggested that the Japanese government embark on \\"colonial and agricultural undertakings\\" on uninhabited islands in the South China Sea. He also said that the Japanese government should take the Ryūkyū as a base to attack and capture Luzon Island by surprise, then use Luzon as a base for its \\"southward advance\\" to seize Java and other places, ultimately spreading its \\"military might\\" in Southeast Asia. He believed that Japan should \\"adopt suitable means of aggression and annexation\\" to \\"increase its national interests.\\" This became the first draft of Japan's \\"southward advance\\" strategy.

Ports for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 were released simultaneously. It is one of the first batch of five games from Electronic Arts, and EA calls it out as \\"truly EA's first game.\\"30th Anniversary of Our First Games Shipped - EA News Versions for the Amstrad CPC and IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk) followed in 1984. Though not a direct clone, Hard Hat Mack is similar in theme and gameplay to Nintendo's 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game. Gameplay The player guides a construction worker through a series of goals, making use of open paths, springboards, conveyor belts, and elevators, taking care not to run out of time. Assuming the role of the titular Hard Hat Mack, the player has three lives. Level One (building framework). The player must pick up loose girder pieces to fill four gaps in the floor, then capture a moving jackhammer to secure them. At the same time, the player must avoid bolts thrown from above, a wandering vandal and OSHA representative, and falling through gaps or off the edge of the building. Level Two (construction site). The player guides Hard Hat Mack through a four- level construction site and collect six lunchboxes guarded by various obstacles. An enemy blocks the final hurdle, requiring a carefully timed jump. Once all the lunchboxes have been collected, the player must guide Mack up a conveyor belt so that an overhead electromagnet pulls him to safety before he can fall into an incinerator. Level Three (factory). The player collects six boxes and drops each one into a processor. An enemy moves back and forth near one of the boxes, requiring a very careful jump. The player must avoid falling into a portable toilet at the bottom center of the screen. At the completion of a round, the game cycles anew with faster gameplay. Reception Softline stated that the Apple version of Hard Hat Mack \\"bears a certain similarity to Miner 2049er, but it's a good game in its own right and the animation is a little better\\". Video also reviewed the Apple version in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as \\"a 'must' buy for Apple arcaders\\" and \\"indisputably one of the finest programs ever made for the Apple\\". Reviewers noted that the game's \\"look and play\\" were inferior to the Atari version, but this was attributed to the Apple II's systemic limitations and designers Abbot and Alexander were recommended for a \\"round of applause\\" from readers. In 1984 Softline readers named the game the sixth most-popular Apple program of 1983. Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer in 1984 called the game \\"a brand new concept in arcade action\\", stating that he was unaware of another set in the construction industry. PC Magazine in 1984 gave Hard Hat Mack 10.5 points out of 18. It described the game as \\"computer game pop art—flashy to the eye, but hollow inside. For all of its nice touches, I quickly became bored.\\" In late 1983, California state senator Dan McCorquodale, offended by portrayal of OSHA as a villain in the game, sent a complaint letter to an Emporium-Capwell store in Santa Clara, California, accusing the game of being \\"anti-worker\\" and of skewing the public perception of the federal government. As a result, six days later the store pulled Hard Hat Mack from the shelves. Amstrad Computer User stated the Amstrad CPC version is ″not an outstandingly good game, or an absolutely crummy one either″. In 1996, Next Generation listed Hard Hat Mack at number 92 in their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\". They judged it the most successful attempt at a platform game for its time, due to the developers' effective execution of a number of elements that have since become mainstays of the platforming genre.

The character first appeared on- screen during the episode airing on 6 December 1989. He arrived as part of the McDonald family introduced by producer Mervyn Watson along with his twin brother Andy (Nicholas Cochrane) and parents Liz (Beverley Callard) and Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson). For the first year on the Street, the character was credited by the actor's real surname Gregory, before changing to Gregson from early 1991 onwards. Steve is Coronation Street most married character, having been married seven times to five women. In September 2015, Gregson announced a break due to personal reasons, and Steve was off-screen from November 2015 to 22 April 2016. Steve's storylines include his many failed relationships: with Vicky Arden (Chloe Newsome), Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin), Karen Phillips (Suranne Jones), Ronnie Clayton (Emma Stansfield), Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly), Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), as well as Tracy giving birth to his daughter Amy (Elle Mulvaney) and depression. He also has a son, Oliver, with Leanne, whom he impregnated whilst his wife Michelle was pregnant with Ruairi. However, Ruairi was stillborn. In 2019, Steve and Tracy struggled to cope when their 14-year-old daughter, Amy, fell pregnant by gang member Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett). Steve later discovered that hairdresser Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell) is actually his biological daughter following his relationship with Fiona, 20 years prior to Emma's arrival in Weatherfield. Storylines Steve arrived in Coronation Street, in December 1989, at the age of 15, with twin brother, Andy (Nicholas Cochrane) and parents, Jim (Charles Lawson) and Liz (Beverley Callard). From the start, the lads were high-energy tearaways initially causing aggravation for Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley). Steve and Andy got up to a lot of mischief, including a joyride in an industrial earth mover, breaking Alf's shop window. The lads were brought up mainly by their mother because their father Jim was in the army and away more than he was home. When he was home, the hot tempered Jim, whose tirades were often fuelled by whiskey and beer, had the boys fearing and resenting him. Steve grew up with little respect for his father but a great deal for his mother. It did not stop him from getting into scrapes, no matter how much it worried his mother. Schoolboy pranks turned into illegal activities when Steve was sure he could pull off a scam or two only to find out that the long arm of the law was only a few steps away. Steve was caught selling stolen car radios, and falling into a bad lot which got his brother, Andy, beaten up. Steve ran away with a teenage love to the Lake District and had to be retrieved and defended against Jim by his mother. The McDonalds did not have a lot of money and this seemed to fuel Steve's ambitions, always looking for a way to make money. Steve started working with Jim in a building business but Jim was drinking a lot and during an argument and scuffle on scaffolding, Jim fell into a skip and was paralysed for a time. After Jim's recovery, things started to improve between father and son. They seemed to come to an acceptance of each other. In 2000, he had dealings with local gangster Jez Quigley (Lee Boardman). After learning that Jez killed Tony Horrocks (Lee Warburton) and Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss), Steve decides to testify against him in court. After Jez is found not guilty, he soon plans revenge. He lures Steve into a car park where he is savagely beaten by several of Jez's henchmen. After been found by Jim and taken to hospital, Jim takes revenge by beating Jez. Jez later dies from his injuries after making another attempt on killing Steve. Jim is sentenced to eight year for manslaughter, after this Steve mended his ways. Steve was married to Karen Phillips (Suranne Jones) twice. During his separation from Karen in 2003, he had a one-night stand with Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), consequently making her pregnant. Tracy gave birth to their daughter Amy (Holly Bowyer and Rebecca Pike), though she initially was named Patience by Roy Cropper (David Neilson) when he was deceived into believing Amy was his daughter. Tracy later decided she wanted to bring up her daughter herself, and revealed that Steve was the baby's father on Steve and Karen's second wedding day. Karen was horrified but later forgave him. Tracy was persistent in causing disruption for Steve and Karen which continued throughout 2004, until Steve ended his relationship with Karen on Christmas Day, admitting it was getting too much for him. In March 2005, he briefly dated single mother Louise Hazel, but the dalliance soon fizzled out partly due to Tracy's presence. For a brief period, he dated Tracy, intending to get parental responsibility for Amy, rather than having feelings for Tracy. Tracy became aware of Steve's scheme and attempted to prevent Steve having access to Amy. The case went to court where Steve was granted legal rights to see his daughter. Steve starts dating StreetCars employee Ronnie Clayton (Emma Stansfield), a local gangster's estranged wife. Ronnie tries to frame him when she accidentally ran down a pensioner in her taxi, but she was eventually caught. Steve's alibi for the crime was that he spent the night with his new business partner Lloyd's girlfriend Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu). This led to the temporary closure of Street Cars when Lloyd refused to work with Steve. Lloyd eventually forgave Steve for his deception and they reopened the business. Later that year, Steve bought The Rovers Return pub from Fred Elliott (John Savident) and installed Liz as landlady and stepfather Vernon Tomlin (Ian Reddington) as cellarman. Steve takes Amy (now played by Amber Chadwick) after Tracy is sentenced to 15 years in prison for the murder of her boyfriend Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). After proposing to Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly), he organises a quick wedding for them. Many people disapprove of them marrying because Becky had been engaged to Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) just before she accepted Steve's proposal. Steve bans Liz and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) from the wedding after they bet on whether the ceremony would go ahead. In the end, Becky turns up late for the ceremony drunk, rendering her unable to carry out the nuptials. Steve then brings her home in disgrace. The following day, Becky wakes up and, believing that she has been married, hunts for her ring; however, Michelle reveals all in the pub. She later leaves Steve after admitting that it would never work. They later reconcile and begin plans for another wedding. Steve and Becky have their second wedding. The ceremony goes off without a hitch, however, their happiness is short lived when The Rovers is searched for drugs, which are found in Becky's bag, having been planted by Becky's ex Slug (Marshall Lancaster). She is arrested and taken to the police cells, however, the charges are later dropped. Steve reveals that he wants another child with Becky, however, she doesn't want any children of her own. This leads to various arguments between the pair. Becky later falls pregnant, leaving the couple without much choice in the matter. She later suffers a miscarriage. After a second miscarriage, Steve and Becky discover that Becky cannot have children and later decide to adopt. Becky and Steve's ex-girlfriend, Tracy, fight at Blanche Hunt's (Maggie Jones) funeral because Becky has become very close to Amy (now played by Elle Mulvaney). At an adoption panel meeting, Steve and Becky are told that they have been unsuccessful in their bid to adopt, following a bad reference from Becky's half-sister, Kylie Turner (Paula Lane). Steve is not impressed when Becky moves Kylie into the pub to live with them as she is homeless. On Christmas Eve, Steve and Becky were not happy when Tracy returned. When she entered The Rovers, she managed to insult people and Steve had to reprimand Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) for starting a fight with Tracy where Steve had to restrain Gail. On Christmas Day, Steve very nearly had to remind Gail although it was okay as Tracy and Gail called a truce. Amy revealed to Tracy that Steve and Becky had bought Max (Harry McDermott), Kylie's son. This gave Tracy cause to literally pick Amy up and take her back to No.1 where she says that she was going to ring social services for buying Max. Steve hires a new manager for the pub, Stella Price (Michelle Collins) who moves in with her daughter Eva (Catherine Tyldesley) and her boyfriend Karl Munro (John Michie). Becky discovers this and is annoyed and goes round the pub to take charge and plays loud music and a fight breaks out resulting in the pub window being smashed. Steve returns and is furious to discover what Becky has done and tells his she does not own the pub any more. Steve and Becky split up and he begins a relationship with Tracy, after she announces that she is pregnant with his child, who later turn out to be twins. After Lloyd leaves the area, Steve and Becky go into business and decide to extend the business when they meet hotel manager Danny Stratton (Jeremy Sheffield). Tracy assumes that they were having an affair and while searching the hotel for them, she collapses at the hotel and miscarries the babies. However, Steve is told that Becky pushed her down the stairs and caused the miscarriage. Steve is very bitter towards Becky and repeatedly accuses her of killing his unborn children, which she strongly denies. He proposes to Tracy on Christmas Day and he buys No. 13 from Lloyd and they move in and he and Becky get divorced. Steve and Tracy marry but, at the wedding reception in The Rovers, Becky gives Steve a copy of Tracy's medical records, proving that she lied about Becky causing her miscarriage. Steve is disgusted with Tracy and tries to stop Becky leaving with Danny for Barbados but fails and he watches as they board the plane. Steve angrily tells Tracy he wants their marriage annulled and that he loves Becky, not her. Steve's attempts to get the annulment fail as he needs her co-operation and cannot file for divorce for a year. Worse still, he finds himself unable to kick her out of No. 13 as the deeds are in joint names. Unwilling to move out of his own house, Steve remains and tries to persuade Tracy to move out but she won't either so Steve has the house converted into two flats but Tracy threatens to call the council as he didn't apply for planning permission so that is reversed. However, Steve then allows Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and her son, Craig (Colson Smith), to move in with Tracy and Amy. He thought this would make Tracy move out but she ends up becoming friends with Beth so he sells the house to Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) who is looking for somewhere for him and his son after splitting from his wife a few months before. When Steve mentions he needs the house cleaned, Kevin's daughter Sophie (Brooke Vincent) offers and Steve accepts her offer. While Sophie is cleaning, her old friend Ryan Connor (Sol Heras) helps her and while having a cigarette, Steve's curtains are set on fire. Steve and Ryan's mother, Michelle, catch them trying to put out the fire. Afterwards, Kevin tells Steve he isn't interested in buying the house as Steve refused to pay for them. Steve begins to develop feelings for ex-girlfriend, Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh), and doesn't believe Tracy when she complains that she's ill until she is hospitalised, after collapsing from kidney failure. She tells Steve she still loves him and begs him to stay by her bedside until she wakes up from her sleep. Steve reluctantly does but after helping Michelle deal with Ryan, they share a kiss, unaware that Amy has seen them. Michelle urges Steve to tell Tracy the truth, but he only tells her that he wants to live life on his own. Deirdre came out and furiously told Tracy everything: the kiss and making Amy promise not to say anything, and Tracy is heartbroken. The next day, Steve explained everything to Tracy, saying that nothing has changed between them and he loves Michelle. Tracy tells Steve he's being a fool, but all she got back was an apology for not being honest with her earlier. Steve and Michelle move into 4b Victoria Court. In September 2013, Stella puts The Rovers up for sale, and Steve decides to put an offer down to cheer up Michelle, who is down in the dumps at the moment. Although she is angry that he kept it a secret, she eventually comes round to the idea of being the landlady, and is given a 50% share of the place. When Liz returns, she is given the role of assistant manager and is seen behind the bar more often than Steve and Michelle. The reason for this is that Steve still has his taxi-firm business, StreetCars and is struggling to cope with running two businesses. Michelle advise Steve to sell his share of the taxi-firm to his friend and current business partner, Lloyd, which he agrees to. In December 2013, when Michelle's friend, Carla Connor (Alison King), marries Steve's friend, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), Steve and Michelle help plan the wedding, which prompts them to begin a party planning business together. However, a few months later, Steve is shocked to discover that Peter is having an affair with Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). When the truth is revealed, Carla says that she is going to kill Tina and is prime suspect in her murder investigation when she is found lying dead on the pavement. When Michelle discovers that Steve knew about Tina and Peter's affair, she dumps him, packs her bags and moves in with Carla. However, they get back together within a week and begin to save up for a holiday home in Spain. In January 2015, Steve is diagnosed with clinical depression and not wanting Michelle to have to cope with him, he decides to end their relationship without giving her any explanation. This leads Michelle to believe that he does not love her anymore. Whilst driving the Underworld staff to an awards' ceremony for Carla to accept an award, Steve is chased by some boy racers who eventually cut him up and cause him to swerve. Steve crashes the minibus, leaving the staff trapped in the wreckage. Steve is the first person to awaken from unconsciousness, and wanders off to leave the others to deal with the traumatic situation. Whilst at the hospital, Steve tells Michelle that he has depression and that this is the reason why he ended their relationship. Michelle promises to help him recover. In March 2015, Michelle discovers that Steve owes £10,000 in tax which Steve had been ignoring for the past few months. Liz's boyfriend, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) offers to lend him the money to clear his debt, but after starting an affair with Tracy, the couple plan to take the Rovers from the McDonald's so Tony lies to Steve and tells him that he needs his money back to pay off some loan sharks. Subsequently, Steve proposes to Michelle in the back room of The Rovers. However, Steve is convinced that Michelle doesn't really want to marry him, and only said yes out of pity, so he calls off the engagement. Later, Steve finds a candlelight dinner prepared in the back of The Rovers, and he assumes that Tony has prepared the meal for Liz, and calls Tony out in front of a busy pub at the Butler Auction. Michelle then confesses that it was actually her who had prepared it for both of them, and calls Steve up onto the stage to explain that she had said yes to him because she loves him. Michelle then proposes to Steve, getting the engagement back on track. In May 2015, after some persuasion from Liz, a reluctant Steve agrees to sell his share of the Rovers to a company called \\"Travis Limited\\", who, unbeknownst to everyone, is actually Tony. Tony then persuades Liz into selling her share of the pub to Travis Ltd, in order to start a new life in Spain. However, Michelle's best friend Carla steps in and offers to buy Liz's share of the pub, which not only settles Michelle's worries about being kicked out of their home, but Liz accepts asking Tony why it would be better to sell to a stranger rather to someone that they know and trust. Carla then promises to keep Steve and Michelle as the pub managers. On 26 May 2015, after a total of seven years of an on-and-off relationship, Steve and Michelle finally marry. Steve leaves to stay with Andy for a while in Spain, he later returns for Michelle's birthday. Steve is furious with Michelle when he learns that she kissed an ex-boyfriend, Will Chatterton (Leon Ockenden). Michelle plans to leave for a job on a cruise ship when her attempts to get Steve to forgive her fail. Steve and Michelle later reconcile. Steve has sex with Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and she becomes pregnant. Steve told Liz that he got Leanne pregnant and explain it was one night stand that he thought Michelle had gone to cruise ship. Leanne informs Steve of her intention to keep the unborn child. Steve decides to keep his involvement a secret and having nothing to do with the unborn child. Michelle then expresses an interest of having children of their own. Steve agrees to have a baby after speaking to Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin). Michelle then also falls pregnant, but unfortunately delivers their baby boy, Ruairi, at 23 weeks. The baby doesn't survive, leaving both Michelle and Steve devastated. Michelle then finds out that Leanne's baby, Oliver, is Steve's baby, after their one-night stand, Michelle then leaves Steve for good, unable to forgive him. Steve finds out that Michelle is now in a relationship with Tracy's ex-husband, Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) to his dismay. Michelle then begins a relationship with Robert and divorces Steve. He then tries to make a go of things with Leanne, so they can be a family, due to them having Oliver. Steve proposes and Leanne accepts. They both later realise their relationship won't work as they don't love one another, but agree to be friends. Steve then starts dating Tracy again, despite the disapproval of Liz and Amy. Steve and Tracy eventually remarry. After the New Year, Amy tells both Steve and Tracy that she is pregnant at 14 years old which horrifies Steve, leading him to accuse Aadi Alahan (Zennon Ditchett) and Amy's step- cousin Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) of impregnating her. However it was shortly revealed that Simon's arch enemy Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett) is the biological father. After learning Tyler is 17 years old, Steve realises Tyler could legally go to prison for having sex with a minor. However Steve does the right thing by Amy and does not take legal proceedings. Both Tracy and Tyler pressure Amy into having an abortion, but Amy is adamant that she wants to keep the baby. Steve and Tracy supports her decision, but also decides to adopt her baby and raise it as their own. Casting Simon Gregson began his time in Coronation Street at the age of fifteen in 1989, when he and Nicholas Cochrane were selected to play the teenage twin sons of a new family in The Street. Whilst filming with the soap opera he filmed a guest appearance for the comedy series Red Dwarf, alongside fellow actor Craig Charles (who plays the lead character in the comedy). Craig Charles has played Lloyd Mullaney in Coronation Street since 2005. In September 2015, it was announced that Gregson had taken an extended break from the show for \\"personal reasons\\" and that Steve would be off-screen for several months. He would also not appear in the upcoming live episode, but would feature in the episodes either sides of it. Steve departed in November 2015, but returned in April 2016. Development=Relationship with Fiona Middleton= After Steve breaks up with Vicky Arden (Chloe Newsome), he decides to pursue Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin). Gregson reckoned she was a good match for his character, as he needed someone he could have a good time with and who shared his interests. He also wanted someone who was not looking for a serious relationship. Gregson described Fiona as a female version of Steve, and said \\"She's a real woman of the Nineties who knows what she wants. She's also pretty streetwise, which Steve loves.\\" Steve and Fiona's relationship is strained when Fiona becomes fed up of playing hard to get, and then shows him up at a party. Griffin said Fiona is giving Steve \\"a run for his money\\" and that he is not sure how to react, as he has never met someone like her before. The actress also said that Steve treated Vicky badly, and Fiona will not put up with the same behaviour, which is why she was angry that he treated her as \\"an unpaid skivvy\\" at his party. When Fiona meets Steve's ex-girlfiend Vicky, she immediately sees her as a threat to her relationship. Steve carries on gambling and it becomes clear that Vicky still has feelings for Steve. Vicky discovers that Fiona and Steve's relationship has been difficult despite them deciding to move in together. Steve promises to stop gambling but when he learns that Vicky has inherited £240,000, he gets back with her.Little 1995, p.234. Griffin believed that Fiona was actually more annoyed at Steve for flaunting his relationship with Vicky in her presence than losing him. She concluded \\"I reckon she's had a pretty lucky escape.\\" =Relationship with Karen Phillips= Steve began a relationship with Karen Phillips, played by Suranne Jones. Rick Fulton of the Daily Record noted that Karen vows to be more \\"wily\\" with her romantic interests after seeing her friend Bobbi \\"wrapping boyfriend Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson) around her little finger\\". Her friend and colleague Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) makes a series of bets with Karen regarding how new boyfriend Steve treats her: this culminates in Janice betting Karen that she can get Steve to propose to her. Of the storyline, Jones stated that: \\"Karen can't believe she's on the verge of getting married for a bet\\". She characterises Karen as \\"not the type of girl to back out of a tricky situation\\" and states that she and Steve find themselves \\"in a game of bluff\\" with each \\"waiting for the other to pull out.\\" Gregson felt the marriage was \\"quite fitting\\" and that his character \\"thinks it's a bit of a laugh\\". The wedding scenes were filmed on 6 May 2001 and screened on 30 May 2001. Billy Sloan of the Sunday Mail stated that the scenes were \\"guaranteed to provide a bit of light relief\\" after serious storylines such as Toyah Battersby's (Georgia Taylor) rape and Alma Halliwell's (Amanda Barrie) cervical cancer diagnosis. Jones felt that Steve was \\"definitely the man for Karen\\" as the two characters had \\"similar personalities\\". She stated that Karen had dumped her previous boyfriend, Vikram, because he \\"wasn't racy enough and doesn't have the edge Steve has\\". In September 2001, Jones stated that she \\"[feels] sorry for Steve sometimes\\" in regard to Karen's negative characteristics. She indicated that she'd \\"love to see Steve and Karen having the same impact on viewers as Dirty Den and Angie did\\". In November 2001, the two characters fall out because Karen insults Steve's mother Liz, though they later end up back together. Discussing the success of the pairing, Gregson compared Steve and Karen to \\"a mini Jack and Vera\\" with \\"the shouting and the arguments\\" and \\"the feistiness of the characters\\". He added that Steve and Karen \\"can't live with each other and can't live without each other\\". Gregson also remarked that the relationship was \\"going back to what Coronation Street set out to be\\" which he felt to be \\"hen-pecked husbands and very strong women\\". =Relationship with Becky Granger= Steve embarked on an affair with fellow resident Becky Granger, portrayed by Katherine Kelly. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), stating: \\"Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, and it was no strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her.\\" When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, he was asked if he thought that Steve has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: \\"I think he's turned it around. She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!\\" Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009, their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV who aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in a series of romantic plots which ITV dubbed the \\"Summer of Love\\" season of the soap, with advertisements airing. =Depression and reunion with Michelle Connor= Steve's depression storyline saw him reunite with ex Michelle Connor played by Kym Marsh (pictured) In 2014, Producer Stuart Blackburn revealed that Steve's depression storyline was going to be a big storyline, stating: \\"It's going to run through the autumn and build up from there. On Christmas Day and beyond, we'll see a real challenge to Steve and Michelle's relationship. I absolutely know that Simon Gregson and Kym Marsh are very good actors. I hope that the great comedy that Steve brings will absolutely be on screen for the next decade and onwards, but I also wanted to explore a story where Steve looked in the mirror on his 40th birthday and started to wonder whether he was really good enough for Michelle. He also blamed himself for Lloyd's heart attack and he feels guilty for his role in what happened to Tina. Steve is taking a long, hard look at himself and he's not liking what he sees. It's going to run from there, and there will still be comedy in the lead-up as Steve tries to hide away from the demons in his head. Fundamentally what I wanted to do is tell what will hopefully be a really positive, uplifting love story between Michelle and Steve.\\" In January 2015, it was revealed that Steve would reunite Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) in the aftermath of the upcoming mini bus crash storyline. It was also confirmed that Steve and Michelle would be the next Weatherfield couple to tie the knot. Speaking of this Marsh said; \\"I'm delighted, absolutely delighted. It'll be weird after being Michelle Connor for nearly nine years, but it totally makes sense for us as characters. Simon and I love working together, and nobody likes to see us broken up.\\" It was also revealed that Michelle would get \\"feisty\\" again when her Steve is blamed for the mini-bus crash. Marsh also revealed that Michelle and Steve's mother, Liz, would clash over the best course of action for Steve. With Michelle now focused solely on helping Steve to get better with his depression following their reconciliation, she faces opposition from his mother Liz as it becomes apparent that they have very different approaches. While Liz adopts a \\"tough love\\" approach with her son, Michelle thinks they should tread more carefully around him, worried about his vulnerable state. Marsh said: \\"They both obviously want to help Steve but because both of them are so worried about him and love him so much - they both want to help him in their own way. Understandably they clash as they're both so concerned about him. They both have different approaches - Liz is more of the tough love approach and tries to get Steve up and doing things, whereas Michelle is much more trying the softly-softly approach.\\" Marsh added: \\"Liz doesn't think it's the best way because Michelle is so protective of Steve and doesn't want to hurt or upset him. After everything that's happened with the crash, Michelle thinks they should go easy on him.\\" Despite the disagreement, Marsh believed that the pair would be able to put their differences aside eventually in order to work together to help Steve. =Michelle and Leanne Battersby's pregnancies= In June 2016, it was announced Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) would fall pregnant following a one-night stand. The father was revealed as Steve. Gregson said that his character may have gone \\"a step too far\\" and that \\"he has to keep Michelle\\". Marsh added that her character would \\"make Steve's life hell\\" if she found out. Danson said Leanne and Michelle will also be \\"forced\\" to be friends after Michelle finds out she is pregnant with Steve's child, and that \\"it's just really awkward\\". Danson also stated that Leanne wants to forget the McDonalds and raise the child with Nick. Liz also finds out, and Gail is \\"thrilled when she finds out\\" and that the situation, \\"It's like a little pressure cooker, it's all waiting to blow\\". Danson also says the storyline \\"provokes a lot of stories for a lot of other characters and it's how they will deal with the repercussions\\". Steve being the father will have implications on Leanne and Nick's relationship and a spark a rivalry between Steve and Nick. Producer Kate Oates said \\"Nick is persistent and Nick adores her\\" and the storyline will see if they can overcome Leanne being pregnant with another man's child. Other appearances A four-part spin-off series entitled Street Car Stories was released in February 2014 and featured comic scenes between Steve and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) in the Street Cars cab office. Reception Steve McDonald has proven to be one of the most popular characters on the Street in recent years due to high-profile storylines, such as his dodgy dealings with Jez Quigley and his explosive relationships with Karen McDonald and Tracy Barlow. At the 2004 Inside Soap Awards, the Tracy/Steve baby secret won the 'Best Storyline' gong. The presence of the McDonald family on Coronation Street and Steve in particular have been singled out for praise. Critic Tony Stewart praised the episodes in which Steve discovered that Lloyd and Liz were having a fling, calling it \\"pure comedy gold, full of wicked laugh-out-loud one-liners...\\" Ian Wylie has been very impressed with Simon Gregson's performance as Steve saying, \\"his on screen performance remains as fresh as the day he started\\". Over the years, storylines involving Steve McDonald have received some negative backlash. In 2002, the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised Coronation Street for being \\"unacceptably menacing\\" in regard to the hospital scene where Steve was threatened by Jez Quigley, broadcast two years previously. A spokeswoman for the soap defended the controversial storyline saying; \\"We are a realistic drama and we did flag up the fact there was going to be violence in the Steve McDonald episode. We are mindful that Coronation Street has a large family audience and endeavour to appeal to young and old at all times.\\" In February 2009, Steve McDonald was voted the nation's favourite soap character in a poll conducted by The People newspaper. Talking about the victory Gregson stated; \\"Oh my God, I am chuffed. I'm delighted people enjoy watching Steve and the scrapes he gets into. And I'm pleased people like to watch him as much as I love playing him.\\" Gregson was nominated in the category of \\"Best Actor\\" at The British Soap Awards 2011. He won the \\"Funniest Male\\" award at the 2013 Inside Soap Awards. He also won \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" at The British Soap Awards 2014. In August 2017, Gregson was longlisted for Best Actor and Funniest Male at the Inside Soap Awards, while the death of Steve and Michelle's son was longlisted for Best Show-Stopper and Steve revealing himself as Oliver's father was longlisted for Best Shock Twist. While Steve revealing himself as Oliver's father did not make the shortlist, Gregson's three other nominations did. Gregson did not win any awards at the ceremony.

During its Jazz Age heyday under the editorship of H.L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan, The Smart Set offered many up-and-coming authors their start and gave them access to a relatively large audience. Its headquarters was in New York City. Early years In 1900, American Civil War veteran and financier Colonel William d'Alton Mann sought to offer a cultural counterpart to his gossip magazine Town Topics, an infamous publication which he used for political and social gain among New York City's elite. Mann purportedly used his Town Topics investigators to gather embarrassing information about wealthy individuals in New York Society and would allow these individuals to suppress the articles in exchange for monetary remuneration. This questionable practice led many historians to suggest the latter magazine functioned more or less as a means for Mann to collect blackmail: When conceiving his new publication entitled The Smart Set, Mann wished to include works \\"by, for and about 'The Four Hundred',\\" referring to Ward McAllister's claim that there were only 400 fashionable people in New York's upper society. As a so-called \\"pasha of the Gilded Age,\\" Mann sought to provide sophisticated content that would reinforce the social values of New York's social elite. As such, Mann initially sought out those writers who were supposedly \\"from the ranks of the best society of Europe and America.\\" Mann gave his new publication the subtitle \\"The Magazine of Cleverness.\\" Mann published the first issue of The Smart Set on March 10, 1900, under the editorship of young poet Arthur Grissom, who had also worked on Town Topics. As editor, Grissom created the formula of the magazine that would remain intact throughout the greater part of its existence: 160 pages containing a novelette, a short play, several poems, and witticisms to fill blank spaces. Its first cover, by Kay Womrath, \\"depicted a dancing couple in evening dress controlled by strings held by a grinning Pan; the slashing S's of the title were in vermilion. The price was twenty-five cents.\\" Its earliest contributors included celebrated poets Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Bliss Carman and Clinton Scollard. Grissom was the first editor to publish works by O. Henry in The Smart Set, and O. Henry's short story, The Lotos and the Bottle, was published by Grissom \\"at the bargain rate of fifty dollars [in] quick cash.\\" However, after a very brief tenure as editor, Grissom died of typhoid fever in December 1901, and novelist Marvin Dana took over as editor, in the first of a series of managerial turnovers that would define the evolution of magazine until its termination. Dana formed an editorial triumvirate consisting of himself and two associate editors, Charles Hanson Towne and newspaper correspondent Henry Collins Walsh. Dana remained as editor until 1904, when he left The Smart Set to work in newspapers. Dana's chosen successor was Towne, previously an editor at Cosmopolitan Magazine. Towne was the magazine's first editor to actively push to publish new literary talents such as James Branch Cabell. He also oversaw a stable of famous contributors such as Jack London, Ambrose Bierce and Theodore Dreiser. Under Towne's editorship, the Smart Set honed its tone and content: By 1905, the magazine reached its peak circulation of 165,000. However, as a result of allegations of blackmail associated with Mann's Town Topics in 1906, The Smart Set's popularity began to precipitously decline, and it immediately lost around 25,000 readers. Dissatisfied with the magazine's direction, Towne resigned his position as editor in 1908 to work with Theodore Dreiser on The Delineator, an American women's magazine. After Towne's departure, Colonel Mann stepped up as editor alongside Fred Splint, and the two quickly set out to revitalize the magazine in order to rebuild its readership. As part of this revitalization, Mann started a monthly book review column and, in 1908, Splint hired the Baltimore newspaperman Henry Louis Mencken to fill the book reviewer position at the suggestion of editorial assistant Norman Boyer. The twenty-eight-year-old Mencken quickly became quite popular with readers as his \\"oracular, pungent, and racy\\" book reviews garnered much attention. Using his position as book reviewer for The Smart Set, Mencken would become \\"America's most important literary and social critic.\\" Soon after, in 1909, George Jean Nathan became the magazine's drama columnist. During his tenure as the Smart Set's resident theater critic, Jean \\"would become an extremely influential figure in the New York drama scene.\\" Nathan \\"matched Mencken in his defiance of conventional mores, his saucy style, [and] his magisterial attitude.\\" Together, the combined criticisms of Mencken and Nathan elevated the substantive content of Mann's magazine to appeal to intellectuals and ensured the magazine's place in literary history. Thayer years With The Smart Set in perpetual decline, Mann sold the magazine in Spring 1911 to John Adams Thayer for $100,000. Thayer, a self-made millionaire who had \\"made a personal fortune as a successful advertising manager at the Ladies' Home Journal.\\" Thayer, who previously pulled the muckraking Everybody's Magazine out of a slump and earned himself a significant fortune from its sale, hoped ownership of The Smart Set would allow him entrance into the social ranks of New York's high society. However, the magazine's ruined reputation made this difficult and his purchase left him in charge of a sinking ship. After Mencken and Nathan both declined the offer of editorship, Thayer assumed the position of editor-in-chief and appointed the magazine's Associate Editor, Norman Boyer, as Managing Editor. An expert in advertising, Thayer added a slogan to the magazine's subtitle, stating that \\"Its Prime Purpose is to Provide Lively Entertainment for Minds That Are Not Primitive.\\" The new slogan was unsuccessful in restoring the magazine's reputation and popularity, but in 1912 a younger, more rebellious audience began reading The Smart Set for that very reason. To accommodate this new demographic, Thayer, at the recommendation of Mencken, handed over the editorship to Willard Huntington Wright in 1913. Wright was a Harvard graduate and had served as the literary editor of The Los Angeles Times. Wright outlined the magazine's new editorial direction in the next month's issue: Although only lasting a year, Wright's tenure marked a period of artistic prosperity for The Smart Set. Thayer, undoubtedly regretting the decision later, appointed Wright as editor with complete control of the magazine's content and direction. Wright, immediately taking advantage of this position, began collecting manuscripts from new artists and hired Ezra Pound as an overseas talent scout. With an appreciation for new and unconventional literary styles, Wright steered the magazine into publishing more experimental and avant-garde literary works by authors such as D.H. Lawrence, Joseph Conrad, William Butler Yeats, and Ford Madox Ford. Predictably, Wright's editorial decision caused a drastic reduction in readership and angered the magazine's advertisers, who began withdrawing financial backing. Additionally, Wright was using The Smart Set's checkbook to overpay authors for their work and was attempting to secretly fund a prototype of a more radical publication with Mencken. As a result, Thayer fired Wright in 1914 and announced an end to the magazine's avant-garde content and a return to more traditional material. By the end of Wright's editorship, however, the magazine was in economic disrepair, and Thayer handed over ownership to Colonel Eugene Crowe in return for forgiveness of debts. Nevertheless, due to the fired Wright's editorial decisions, the magazine had acquired a new intellectual audience. Their readership included such notable authors as \\"Theodore Dreiser, Ezra Pound, Sinclair Lewis, Hugh Walpole, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway; such university professors as Stewart Sherman and Percy Boynton; and a number of prominent journalists and critics, including Edmund Wilson, Burton Rascoe, Alfred Kazin, Franklin Pierce Adams and Harold Ross,\\" the co-founder of The New Yorker magazine who was inspired to create the latter publication upon the demise of The Smart Set. Mencken and Nathan years H.L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan Having little interest in running a magazine, Crowe gave control of The Smart Set to Eltinge Warner, who then appointed Mencken and Nathan as co-editors with total artistic control. Warner remained in control of the magazine's accounts—circulation, advertising, and bookkeeping—while Mencken and Nathan focused on literary content. In a series of measures to economize, Mencken and Nathan relocated the magazine's office to a smaller location and reduced the staff, retaining only themselves and a secretary, Sara Golde. Additionally, Warner reprinted previous issues of The Smart Set under the title Clever Stories. In their most successful effort to boost revenue, Mencken and Nathan began the pulp magazine The Parisienne in 1915 as a place to publish a surplus of manuscripts they deemed inferior for The Smart Set. The Parisienne \\"capitalized on the then current war interest in France\\" generated significant profits, which they used to offset the production costs of The Smart Set. The co-editors sold The Parisienne to Warner and Crowe in 1916 and repeated the process with Saucy Stories and, in 1920, Black Mask. Mencken and Nathan's co-editorship helped to bring about a golden era for new literature and The Smart Set. Together, they \\"created a uniquely liberated mass-market venue for American fiction; this fact alone suggests the importance of this magazine inrelation to American literary developments in the teens and early twenties.\\" Circulation during their co-editorship was between 40,000 and 50,000, making it one of the most far-reaching venues for literature of the period. Mencken and Nathan cultivate a youthful readership who had grown increasingly restive and disillusioned with America in the aftermath of The Great War. During these years, \\"Mencken constantly exhorted his fellow critics and literary historians to provide realistic appraisals and re-evaluations of our [American] cultural past, which would then, he felt, influence the present.\\" During this time the magazine featured works by Edna St. Vincent Millay, Theodore Dreiser, Aldous Huxley, Sinclair Lewis, Benjamin De Casseres, Eugene O'Neill and Dashiell Hammett, among others. In May 1915 The Smart Set published two stories from James Joyce's Dubliners, the first time Joyce's work appeared in an American publication. The magazine introduced F. Scott Fitzgerald in September 1919, when it published his short story Babes in the Woods. In addition to introducing new literary talent, the two editors were renowned social critics, who lampooned virtually every facet of American culture. Although they were known for their satire, their increasingly controversial material became the reason for their departure from The Smart Set and would set in motion the end of the magazine itself. Mencken and Nathan's editorship at The Smart Set came to an end after they planned to run a satirical piece on President Warren G. Harding following his death. Harding died in August 1923. His funeral procession involved transporting the body across the country from San Francisco to Ohio. The mainstream media began to sentimentalize the procession, to the dismay of American intellectuals, who noticed a hypocritical change in the press's attitude. Among the dissatisfied were Mencken and Nathan. The two co-editors planned to run a satirical piece on the president's funeral, treating the president in death as they did in life. However, the magazine's printers noticed the piece and reported its contents to an incensed Warner. Considering the piece to be a form of treason, Warner demanded that the editors remove it, and in a rage, announced that he was selling the magazine. Warner's removal of their satirical piece marked the end of the editors' carte blanche over the magazine's content, and they sought the freedom and control over their own publication. Upon leaving, Mencken and Nathan began a collaboration with the publishing magnate Alfred A. Knopf and started The American Mercury.  Decline and demise Press baron William Randolph Hearst's purchase of The Smart Set signaled the beginning of its demise. Before leaving The Smart Set Mencken and Nathan recommended Morris Gilbert to replace them as editor. Reportedly, Gilbert had no idea that Warner was planning to sell the magazine upon accepting his position as editor. Under the editorship of Gilbert, the magazine's attitude and content reverted to the days before Mencken and Nathan's (or even Wright's) time as editors. However, Gilbert's position as editor was short-lived. In 1924, Warner sold the magazine to the publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who immediately gave editorial control to George D'Utassey. Unable to cope with the new management, Gilbert resigned soon after. Hearst's ownership of the magazine brought about an editorial focus on commercialism and superficial moral themes. As the magazine's new editor, D'Utassey reversed the artistic headway that Mencken and Nathan had established for the magazine and changed the subtitle to \\"True Stories from Real Life.\\" Under D'Utassey the magazine veered away from unconventional literature and satire. Although (or perhaps because) the content changed, Hearst's ownership led to huge profits, and circulation grew to 250,000 in 1925. In 1929 the magazine merged with Hearst's newly acquired McClure's to form The New Smart Set, under the editorship of Margaret Sangster. Under Sangster, the magazine became a publication targeted towards young women and was given a new subtitle, \\"The Young Woman's Magazine.\\" However, following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the magazine was unable to survive the economic slump. It ceased publication in June 1930. Legacy In 1934, some of the best pieces from the magazine were gathered in The Smart Set Anthology, published by Reynal & Hitchcock. In 2007, Drexel University launched an online cultural journal titled The Smart Set. Drexel's journal shares some ideals with the original Smart Set and lists Owen Hatteras, a pen name used by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan of the original journal, on its masthead, but its connection to Mencken and Nathan's magazine is unofficial.

She was the sixth ship (and second cruiser) of the French Navy to be named after Jean-Baptiste Colbert (the previous one was scuttled at Toulon in 1942). She served in the Navy from 1956 to 1991, before being converted into a museum ship at Bordeaux from 1993. Colbert was scrapped in 2016. History=Early service= De Grasse in June 1959. Her construction began in the Brest dockyards in 1953. She was designed as a powerful ship, the second of the De Grasse series, able to overcome all threats solely by her guns' weight of fire - she had 57 mm and 127 mm turrets for a firing rate of one shot per second. Launched on 24 March 1956 in Brest, France, starting her trials on 5 December 1957 and officially entering active service on 5 May 1959, she was made part of a 15-ship squadron, with the main aims of protecting aircraft carriers from air attack, shore bombardment for ground operations, command hub for naval operations and evacuating French expatriates from overseas. In 1964 a naval reorganisation made her the flagship of France's Mediterranean squadron (escadre de Méditerranée) at Toulon, which was mainly made up of complementary units such as aircraft-carriers and frigates. =Foreign representative= Her role as a foreign representative of France was important. In 1961 she repatriated the remains of Marshal Hubert Lyautey and she ferried General De Gaulle both on his 1964 South American tour and on his June–July 1967 official visit to Canada (the latter trip was the occasion of his famous \\"Vive le Québec libre!\\" speech - the diplomatic row which followed put an end to the trip). During the Atlantic crossing on board Colbert De Gaulle signed a number of decrees, such as n°67-611 (23 July 1967, on interpreters in the army reserve) and n°67-612 (on interpreters in the naval reserve). Colbert also represented France at the bicentennial festivities in Australia in 1988. =Later life= Colbert was superseded at the end of the 1960s by a new generation of ships better adapted to new threats. Her big-gun-based armament had become obsolete and inefficient against supersonic attack aircraft and thus between 1970 and 1972 she underwent extensive modifications in Brest to become a missile cruiser, with a twin-armed launcher for Masurca surface-to-air missiles. She once again became flagship for the Mediterranean squadron from 1976, but her duties from then on were mainly humanitarian or representative - Agadir in 1960 and the evacuation of Bizerte in 1961. She gained a reputation within the French Navy as a ship that had never fired a single shot in anger, with her only ever active service being in the 1991 Gulf War (operation \\"Salamandre\\") a few months before she was decommissioned on 24 May that year.

During 2004 she was France's most-visited museum ship and the city's most-visited historic attraction. She was a private museum, belonging to the state but with the museum's running handed over to \\"The Friends of the Colbert\\" association. A visit lasted between two and three hours, with guided visits given access to parts of the ship closed off to the public, such as the engine rooms and cabins. The ship also housed several permanent exhibitions on the Navy, Météo- France and architectural models (in which one could see modellers at work). The ship's siren went off at midday every Wednesday and Sunday. A covered restaurant and dance-room was built on her foredeck, served by the ship's former kitchens. A \\"Colbert\\" stop on the quay by the ship was even planned on the city's tramway, allowing faster access to or from the city centre and thus increase visitor numbers, whilst the ship's presence led to the quays becoming highly developed. Colbert on the Garonne in Bordeaux. However, the museum ship also had its critics in the city, such as those living by the quays (a \\"Let's Sink the Colbert\\" association even fielded a candidate in the municipal elections of 1995), and the ship also got into recurring financial problems - despite being the owner, the state did not pay its maintenance costs necessary to keep up the ship's security and image (to completely repaint the ship, for example, cost more than 500,000 €, too high a price for the museum's budget). Under pressure from the Mairie of the city and local associations, and without other funding forthcoming, the museum ship closed to the public on 2 October 2006. Colbert is the largest ship at the graveyard in Landévennec =Scrapping= She was towed on 31 May 2007 (the date that the concession to the \\"Friends\\" ran out) to join the mothball fleet in Landevennec.

The accord was signed in the aftermath of the Smolensk War. The negotiations began on 30 April after the failure of the Polish-Lithuanian siege of Belaya. Overall, the agreement confirmed the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold) for Władysław IV agreeing to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Russia. Władysław, despite holding an upper hand, was trying to bring Russia into an anti-Sweden alliance; hence in a gesture of goodwill he agreed to give the Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories. However, the alliance never came through, as the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś, subsequently objected, and Russians saw no benefit in such an alliance. The sides also reached an agreement on prisoner exchange and a trade treaty.Mirosław Nagielski, Diariusz kampanii smoleńskiej Władysława IV 1633-1634, DiG, 2006, The treaty ended the almost unbroken series of wars between the Commonwealth and its neighbours that had been waged since the beginning of the 17th century.

Despite being called an \\"arowana\\", the African arowana is more closely related to arapaimas, the only other members in the family Arapaimidae, than the South American, Asian, and Australian arowanas in the family Osteoglossidae (the Arapaimidae are sometimes included in the Osteoglossidae). Compared to these, the African arowana has a more terminal mouth and is the only one that feeds extensively on plankton. Description The African arowana is a long-bodied fish with large scales, long dorsal and anal fins set far back on the body, and a rounded caudal fin. Its height is 3.5 to 5.0 times standard length. It has been reported to reach up to long and weigh up to . This fish is gray, brown, or bronze in color. Coloration is uniform in adults, but juveniles often have dark longitudinal bands. African arowanas have air-breathing organs on its branchiae, enabling them to survive in oxygen-depleted water. A suprabranchial organ allows it to concentrate small planktonic food particles and also has a sensory function. Range This species is widespread throughout Africa, where it is native to all the watersheds in Sahelo-Sudanese region, Senegal, and Gambia, as well as parts of eastern Africa. This range includes the basins of the Corubal, Volta, Ouémé, Niger, Bénoué, and Nile Rivers, as well as those of Lake Chad and Lake Turkana. It has been successfully introduced to Côte d'Ivoire, the Cross River in Nigeria, the Sanaga and Nyong Rivers in Cameroon, and the Ogooué River in Gabon, as well as the lower and middle Congo River basin, including Ubangui and Kasaï Rivers.

Species Plantarum 2: 906-907 in Latin Rudbeckia flowers feature a prominent, raised central disc in black, brown shades of green, and in-between tones, giving rise to their familiar common names of coneflowers and black-eyed-susans. All are native to North America, and many species are cultivated in gardens for their showy yellow or gold flower heads that bloom in mid to late summer. The species are herbaceous, mostly perennial plants (some annual or biennial) growing to 0.5–3.0 m tall, with simple or branched stems. The leaves are spirally arranged, entire to deeply lobed, and 5–25 cm long. The flowers are produced in daisy-like inflorescences, with yellow or orange florets arranged in a prominent, cone-shaped head; \\"cone-shaped\\" because the ray florets tend to point out and down (are decumbent) as the flower head opens. A large number of species have been proposed within Rudbeckia, but most are now regarded as synonyms of the limited list given below. Several currently accepted species have several accepted varieties. Some of them (for example the black-eyed susan, R. hirta), are popular garden flowers distinguished for their long flowering times. Many cultivars of these species are known. Rudbeckia is one of at least four genera within the flowering plant family Asteraceae whose members are commonly known as coneflowers; the others are Echinacea, Dracopis, and Ratibida. Rudbeckia species are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species including cabbage moths and dot moths. Etymology The name was given by Carolus Linnaeus to honor his patron and fellow botanist at Uppsala University, Olof Rudbeck the Younger (1660-1740), as well as Rudbeck's late father Olof Rudbeck the Elder (1630-1702), a distinguished Naturalist, Philologist, and Doctor of Medicine (he had discovered the lymphatic system), and founder of Sweden's first botanic garden, now the Linnaean Garden at Uppsala. In 1730 Linnaeus had been invited into the home of the younger Rudbeck (now almost 70) as tutor his youngest children. Rudbeck had then recommended Linnaeus to replace him as a lecturer at the university and as the botanical garden demonstrator, even though Linnaeus was only in his second year of studies.Wilfrid Blunt. The Compleat Naturalist: A Life of Linnaeus, (Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 35. In his book The Compleat Naturalist: A Life of Linnaeus, Wilfred Blunt quotes Linnaeus's dedication: > So long as the earth shall survive and as each spring shall see it covered > with flowers, the Rudbeckia will preserve your glorious name. I have chosen > a noble plant in order to recall your merits and the services you have > rendered, a tall one to give an idea of your stature, and I wanted it to be > one which branched and which flowered and fruited freely, to show that you > cultivated not only the sciences but also the humanities. Its rayed flowers > will bear witness that you shone among savants like the sun among the stars; > its perennial roots will remind us that each year sees you live again > through new works. Pride of our gardens, the Rudbeckia will be cultivated > throughout Europe and in distant lands where your revered name must long > have been known. Accept this plant, not for what it is but for what it will > become when it bears your name.Blunt. The Compleat Naturalist: p.35. Olof Rudbeck The Younger (1660–1740), patron of Linnaeus.

Storylines Gail Potter is a friend of Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones) and a boss. She is first seen as a teenager in July 1974 when she tells Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) that Tricia fancies him. In April 1975, Gail discovers that the man her mother was living with – Frank Peterson – isn't her father as she thought. Angry, Gail leaves home, moving into the shop flat with her co- worker/former schoolfriend, Tricia. Gail is plagued by nuisance telephone calls and when phone engineer, John Lane, turns up one evening to catch the culprit, Gail realises that it is him. Luckily, Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) sees him go in, her suspicions aroused, and the police are called. After the warehouse they work in burns down, Gail and Tricia work in the Corner Shop, but when Renee Bradshaw (Madge Hindle) buys the shop and flat in June 1976, the girls are evicted. Tricia leaves Weatherfield and Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) returns. Elsie ensures that Gail can stay in the flat. Elsie and Gail find work at Sylvia's Separates and move into No 11. She loses her virginity to Roy Thornley but discovers that he is married and Gail is cited in a messy divorce. In December 1976, Sylvia's Separates is taken over by Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) and renamed the Western Front. Elsie is moved from boutique manager to factory supervisor and Gail is promoted to manager with Suzie Birchall (Cheryl Murray), working for her. In early 1977, Suzie joins Elsie and Gail at No 11, and the three women become one of the programme's most popular groups. In November 1978, Mike Baldwin closes down the Western Front, but things look up for Gail in December when Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) gatecrashes a party at Elsie's and asks her out. In January 1979, Gail gets a job working with Emily Bishop in Dawson's Cafe. By April, Brian and Gail are engaged, beginning a long feud between Gail and Brian's mother, Ivy (Lynne Perrie), and saw the arrival of Gail's mother, Audrey Potter (Sue Nicholls). Brian and Gail are married that November and move in with Brian's parents at number five. Gail and Brian move to a one-bedroomed house at 5 Buxton Close in August 1980 and on New Year's Eve, their son, Nicky (Warren Jackson) is born. The Tilsleys' marriage never seems wholly secure, especially with narcissistic Brian being given free rein by his doting mother, and soon hits a rocky spot. Gail is propositioned by Brian's friend, Colin Jackson, and Brian is dazzled by customer Glenda Fox. In January 1982, Brian's boss, Ron Sykes, announces that he is selling the business and emigrating to the Persian Gulf. Faced with the choice of working away or redundancy, Brian goes to work in Qatar. Gail makes friends with neighbour, Jackie Moffatt, but bored at home on her own, asks Jackie to look after Nicky while she works part-time in Jim Sedgewick's café (she had briefly worked there when it first opened in 1980), now run by Jim's ex-wife, Alma Sedgewick, (Amanda Barrie). Brian announces that he is staying in the Gulf, extending his contract by two months. Lonely, Gail agrees to go for a drink with truck driver, Les Charlton, (Graham Fellows) but Nicky goes missing and is eventually found in the newly rebuilt number seven. A distressed Gail thinks about giving up her job and loses interest in Les. But Les's last visit coincides with Brian's return and he makes it very clear to Les that he is not welcome. Brian decides not to return to Qatar and admits having \\"had a drink\\" with a nurse and Gail realizes that his friendship with her was a lot closer than he is admitting. In August 1982, using the money he made in Qatar, Brian opens a garage in partnership with Ron Sykes and for a while, the Tilsleys are happy. In March 1983, things seem to be going so well that Brian takes out a bank loan and buys Ron Sykes's share of the garage. However, there is a change in fortunes – Brian's father, Bert (Peter Dudley), is seriously injured while overinflating a tyre at the garage and dies soon afterwards, and the business starts losing money – forcing Brian to put it up for sale. He is talked out of selling by Gail and Mike Baldwin, deciding to sell the house in Buxton Close instead, and move back in with Ivy. The Tilsleys' marriage now begins to crumble as living under the same roof irritates Ivy and Gail and when in August 1984, Gail is offered the job of manager at Jim's Cafe, she takes it – annoying Brian and Ivy. A couple of months later, there is more friction when Brian finds that Audrey's latest boyfriend, George Hepworth (Richard Moore), made a pass at Gail. By April 1985, Gail has had enough and leaves Brian, moving her and Nicky into a bedsit. This finally makes Brian get a council house so Gail and Nicky move in there with him. Early in 1986, Brian's Australian cousin, Ian Latimer (Michael Loney) visits and stays with Ivy. Soon he and Gail are having an affair. Gail admits this to Brian on learning that she is pregnant and doesn't know who is the father. Blood tests show that Sarah-Louise (Lynsay & Leah King), who is born in January 1987, cannot be Ian's but Brian never really bonds with Sarah- Louise, and moves in with his new girlfriend, Liz Turnbull (Catriona A Elliott). Soon after, Brian divorces Gail. Gail starts dating Jeff Singleton (Jonathan Barlow), and Brian doesn't like the idea of him being a stand-in father. After Brian's abortive attempt to kidnap Nicky, Brian and Gail reconcile and he moves back into Hammond Road, and they remarry in February 1988. However, Gail realises that she married too young and Brian's old- fashioned attitudes about wives mean that the marriage will never work so they separate again but continue living under the same roof. Eventually, Gail asks for another divorce after a massive row one evening in February 1989. Brian's attempt to find other female company that same evening results in him stabbed to death outside a nightclub. Alma returns to Weatherfield from Spain late in 1988, and in June 1989, offers Gail a 40% partnership in Jim's Café, which she accepts. Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) has been working at the café since 1985. To Gail's surprise, she finds herself attracted to Martin, who is 10 years younger than her. Martin comforts Gail when she is upset about recent events and a few kisses leads to them ending up in bed together. Much against Ivy and Audrey's wishes, Martin moves in with Gail and the children, and by the spring of 1990, she is pregnant. Feeling that she can't cope with three children and doesn't want Martin to be tied down too young, she decides to have an abortion. Martin catches her just as her train pulls out of the station and persuades her not to go ahead so David (Thomas Ormson) is born on Christmas Day 1990. Gail and Martin marry in September 1991 and in December, Martin buys number eight and the Platt family move in. Gail's emotional trials are far from over. When Martin studies to become a nurse, Carmel Finnan (Catherine Cusack), a fellow student, stays with them in late 1992 and becomes besotted with Martin. Gail angrily throws her out after Carmel tells Gail that she is too old for Martin but she returns a few weeks later, claiming she's expecting Martin's baby and tries to kidnap David. This causes a fight between her and Gail and Carmel falls down the stairs. At the hospital, it is found that she isn't pregnant and her grandfather arrives, explaining her mental history. During 1994, tensions build as a now teenaged Nicky refuses to acknowledge Martin as a \\"father\\" (particularly when he disciplines him for smoking), causing problems for Martin and Gail. Depressed after Christmas celebrations at work, Martin sleeps with Cathy Power, (Theresa Brindley) and is caught kissing her Audrey's husband, Alf Roberts, (Bryan Mosley). Alf and Martin agree to keep it between them but when Audrey finds out, Martin confesses everything to Gail. Gail takes the betrayal very badly, and although they continue to live together, she and Martin barely speak but reconcile after a family holiday in North Wales. However, tensions with Nick (as he now wants to be called) grow and are aggravated by Ivy's death in August 1995, more than a year after she had left Coronation Street. She leaves most of her estate to Nick – providing he changes his name back to Tilsley. Months of wrangling and bad feeling ensue, with Gail, Martin, Nick and Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff), Ivy's second husband, constantly arguing. Martin, however, disagrees since he is his adoptive father, but Gail knew that Ivy wanted Nicky to have Brian's surname. To end her feud with Ivy despite her death, they agreed to change his surname back to Tilsley. In January 1996, Gail settles the row by getting Don to pay Nick £12,000 for the house. Soon after, Gail meets her half-brother, Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce) when he visits Weatherfield. Later in 1996, Martin and Gail's marriage is strained, due to conflict between Nick and Martin so Stephen invites them to Canada for a holiday and Nick decides to go to school there, using the money Don paid him for Ivy's house. Roy Cropper (David Neilson) begins working in the café with Gail when Alma wants to spend less time there and eventually, Alma sells her share in the café to Roy after she and Gail fall out over Stephen's decision to cancel his contract with Mike. Gail and Roy get on very well and things tick over as usual. Roy even gives Gail and Martin a weekend trip to Paris from the vouchers he has saved. In 1997, Don is in prison after attacking Mike and Alma but is diagnosed with terminal cancer and asks to see Gail to make amends for the trouble he caused since Ivy's death. Don leaves hospital, attacks Mike and crashes Alma's car into the viaduct, killing himself. Nick (now played by Adam Rickett) returns for the funeral and starts dating Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), part of a loud, obnoxious family now living in number five. Gail is furious when Nick and Leanne elope to Scotland in January 1998. Brian's murderer, Darren Whately, is released from prison on parole in 1998 and Nick persuades Leanne to write to him so he starts stalking her. Gail urges Nick to report him to the police when things get out of control and Darren is returned to prison. Leanne and Nick are shocked to learn that Leanne is pregnant, something Gail disapproves of, and their marriage ends after Nick pressures her to have an abortion and tell people that she miscarried. Nick returns to Canada, much to Gail's delight that he is no longer with Leanne, behaviour very similar to her former mother-in-law, Ivy. Gail tires of her responsibility of the café and sells her share to Roy and his new girlfriend Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), but continues to work there. The café relocates in 1999 to a new development on Victoria Street and is renamed Roy's Rolls. 1999 also sees Gail and Martin's marriage get into serious trouble after Gail demands Martin have a vasectomy after she has a pregnancy scare and doesn't want any more children. Martin refuses and Gail's unreasonable behaviour and anger pushes Martin to become good friends with another nurse, Rebecca Hopkins (Jill Halfpenny). They initially bond over troublesome spouses but soon begin an affair that lasts into 2000. Martin plans on leaving Gail for Rebecca, but this is put on hold when they discover that Sarah (now played by Tina O'Brien), now 13, is refusing to eat and being sick. Fearing that she is developing an eating disorder, Gail takes her to the doctors and learns that Sarah is five months pregnant and gives birth to Bethany (Emily & Amy Walton) in June 2000. Sarah struggles with motherhood and Gail quits her job so she can look after Bethany while Sarah is at school and enjoy being a teenager occasionally. The truth about Martin's affair comes out soon after the baby's birth and Gail is devastated. She tries to keep the family together but it doesn't work as Gail kept on taking her frustration out on Sarah, accusing her of being a bad mother which caused her to run away and to move into the Croppers' flat. Gail felt very guilty after Sarah returned home. She breaks down and tells Martin she wants a divorce. Martin moves out in October 2000, and he and Gail divorce the following year. Soon after Martin leaves, Gail gets a job as a receptionist in the newly built medical centre. The character of Gail then becomes central to one of the soap's most high-profile plot lines in which episodes would go on to get viewing figures more than 17 million. Following Alma's death in June 2001, Gail became friends with her cousin: Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), a financial advisor. They gradually formed a relationship for the rest of the year and were eventually married in July 2002. However, while their marriage appeared to be thoroughly perfect as Gail had hoped, she was totally unaware that Richard had financial difficulties after proposals for a bail hostel to be built near apartments he had developed causes them not to sell; because of this, Richard ended up murdering two people and even tried to kill Gail's mother Audrey along with her friend Emily Bishop. When Audrey begins to suspect Richard, she tries to warn Gail but Gail believes Audrey is suffering from dementia as Richard made everyone, including Audrey at first believe through the use of secret mind games. This leads to a row and Gail cuts off contact with Audrey when she continues to call Richard a murderer, much to Audrey's heartache. Also, while Gail was still oblivious to Richard's actions, Sarah was seriously injured in a car crash caused by her boyfriend: Aidan Critchley (Dean Ashton), after he stole Ken Barlow's (William Roache) car. Aidan escapes from the wreckage, leaving Sarah for dead. She makes a full recovery but never forgives Aiden for what he did. When Gail begins to suspect that her husband is more than he seems, she confronts him with her suspicions and the worst is confirmed when Richard admits everything to her in a special two-hander episode broadcast on 24 February 2003; emulating that he murdered both Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw) and his ex-wife Patricia (Annabelle Apsion), left his business partner and the Rovers' landlord Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) to die following a collapse, and tried to kill both Audrey and Emily – the latter which led to Maxine's murder and Richard subsequently framing Aidan for the crimes as revenge for Sarah's accident. Richard, after confessing that his crimes were all part of his financial benefit, tries to justify his actions whilst asserting his love for both Gail and her children. Gail, however, is absolutely horrified with the truth of her husband and calls Richard \\"Norman Bates With A Briefcase\\" before throwing him out. She later reconciles with Audrey and together the pair give a statement to the police about Richard's confession, thus exposing his crimes and making him the most wanted fugitive in the UK. Gail subsequently attempts to rebuild her life back on track, but Richard secretly returns three weeks after fleeing Coronation Street. He takes Gail, Sarah, David (now played by Jack P. Shepherd) and Bethany hostage and attempts to gas them in the garage but their neighbours hear the sound of Richard's car in the garage, so he speeds off and drives them all into the canal. Gail, Sarah, David, and Bethany survive but Richard drowns. Gail later finds out that she faces financial ruin, due to Richard's actions and could lose her house. Her neighbour Vera Duckworth (Elizabeth Dawn) accuses her of being in league with Richard, as she and her husband Jack (Bill Tarmey) also face financial instability as Richard was their financial advisor. However, Audrey saves the day by using her life savings to buy the house for Gail and her family. After managing to overcome her trauma with Richard for the rest of 2003, Gail manages to rebuild her life until she and Sarah end up having another problem together. This begins with Sarah and Bethany moving out of the house and into a flat with Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), her closest friend. This prompts Gail to call Social Services, hoping to get Bethany returned to her so Sarah will have to return too. When this doesn't work, Gail and Sarah have no contact for several months. Sarah becomes pregnant again and she and Todd get engaged, further angering Gail, just like her relationship with her former mother-in-law Ivy. However, Todd admits to Sarah that he is gay so they break up and Sarah and Bethany move out, returning to live with Gail. When Sarah tells Gail what has happened, the fight between Gail and Eileen (Sue Cleaver), Todd's mother, turns physical as Gail is furious at the position Todd has left Sarah in, 16 years old and 7 months pregnant with her 2nd child. Sarah is rushed to hospital with a placental abruption and needs an emergency Caesarean. She survives but baby Billy is very ill and dies the day after he is born. Gail also does her best to come between Nick and his new girlfriend, Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie), believing that Maria will break Nick's heart again as she emigrated with him to Canada briefly once before but returned alone, as she wasn't happy there. They eventually do break up, and despite being very cold with each other for several months, Gail comforts Maria when she is devastated that Nick leaves to start a new job in Nottingham. In 2005, Gail begins a relationship with chiropodist Phil Nail (Clive Russell), much to David's annoyance and he constantly tries to come between them. From early 2006, Gail receives cards from her late husband Richard, unnerving her so much that she becomes reliant on sleeping pills and drink. She contacts the police and thinks that the new boyfriend, Phil, is responsible and this causes Phil and David to argue, resulting in him and Gail breaking up and Phil leaving. Her relationship with David is strained to the point of breakdown when she realizes that he is sending the cards. She takes him to the police to close the case but doesn't press charges. Gail forgives David and believes that she can keep him in line, only to find that he is not going to school. On Christmas Day 2006, David unveils Ivy Brennan's diary, revealing Gail's planned abortion and he also exposes Audrey's affair with Bill Webster (Peter Armitage). David runs away from home when Gail tells him she wants him to start paying rent but returns with the police after claiming that Gail is abusing him. The final straw is when Bethany swallows an ecstasy tablet that was hidden in her doll's head by David in September 2007. Bethany is rushed to intensive care, and following an ultimatum from Sarah, Gail makes David move out and orders him not to attend Sarah's wedding to his enemy Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). As revenge, David writes a suicide note and leaves it on the kitchen table for Gail to find the day before the wedding. However, Sarah finds it first and believing it to be another attention-seeking stunt, she puts it in the bin. The next day, David sees his family celebrating the wedding, despite the suicide note. To prove his point, he drives his car into the same part of the canal that Richard had driven them all into four years earlier. A distraught Gail waits for hours for news on whether he is alive or dead, and when he eventually turns up at the house, Gail swears to him that she will never let the situation get so out of hand again. Her relationship with Sarah becomes strained when it is revealed that Sarah was aware of the suicide note when in fact he hadn't intended on killing himself at all, just ruin Sarah's wedding. She began to blame herself, how her son David becomes evil since his father Martin left the town, and wish that she and Martin never divorced. Gail's half brother Stephen comes to stay for Christmas and offers David a job in Milan which he accepts. However, as revenge for spoiling her wedding day, Sarah plants ecstasy tablets in his drawer at Audrey's salon and when Audrey finds them, Gail insists that David is not to go to Milan. Sarah is offered the job instead and plans on leaving with Jason and Bethany. However, she joyfully tells Jason what she did at the airport and disgusted with her, Jason returns to Weatherfield alone and tells Gail what really happened. In March 2008, David's new girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) tells Gail that she is pregnant with David's baby. Believing that neither of them are ready for parenthood, Gail offers to pay for Tina to have an abortion and to keep it from David, which Tina accepts. However, David soon finds out and is angry with Gail. He goes to pack his bags and Gail begs him not to go and tries to explain her reasons, but David doesn't want to know and pushes her away from him. She is at the top of the stairs and has a terrible fall resulting in her being hospitalised and suffering from short-term amnesia. Gail eventually remembers who pushed her but forgives David believing she pushed him to it. However, believing that he should be punished for nearly killing his mother, he begins smashing up windows in the street resulting in him spending several weeks in prison. Ted Page (Michael Byrne), Gail's long lost father, gets in touch with Audrey. Gail finds out and is angry that she was not told. However, she arranges to meet Ted after he discovers he has a daughter, 3 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild. Gail takes a shine to Tina's father, Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale), and they start dating. Joe later proposes to Gail on a boat he renovated. However, Gail is unaware that Joe is deeply in debt, as his business has collapsed and is frequently visited by a debt collector. Gail marries Joe in January 2010 despite his debt. While Gail and Joe are on holiday the next month, Joe tries to fake his own death for the life insurance money. He tells Gail, who is horrified, and asks him to go to the police but they argue on the boat and Joe falls, spraining his wrist. The fight is witnessed by another couple. Joe eventually manages to push Gail back on to the dock and he sets sail. Shortly afterwards, Joe is knocked from the boat and drowns but Gail thinks he has gone ahead with his plan so she calls David and tells him about Joe's plan and they agree to tell people that Joe has got a job in the Lake District, thinking he will return. They take Joe's boat in from the lake and go home. Gail is devastated when Joe's body is found. However, the police find many inconsistencies in her story, especially when the couple from the lakes come forward as witnesses. She is arrested during Joe's wake for his murder and later charged after an indignant Tina tells the police that Gail intends to visit her daughter in Milan and that she asked Tina to lie to them. Consequently, Gail is denied bail and her trial is scheduled for three months later. Gail fears the worst, especially when former neighbour Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) makes a false testimony against her claiming that Gail admitted in their prison cell to killing Joe with a rolling pin, but is relieved when she is found not guilty. Gail learns that David is engaged to Kylie Turner (Paula Lane) and is against the marriage. Once David and Kylie are married Gail later warms to the marriage and allows them both to continue living with her. Gail and Audrey bump into Audrey's ex-boyfriend, professional con artist, Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers). They report him to the police but he is not charged and returns to Weatherfield, much to Audrey's horror. They reconcile, much to Gail's disgust, and live happily together. Lewis also gets a job at Nick's Bistro. However, Gail is sure that sooner or later Lewis will hurt Audrey so she plots with Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) to get proof that Lewis is really in love with Audrey. Audrey, however, finds out about this and doesn't stop them so when Lewis realizes that she knew, he leaves her. Wanting revenge, he later fools Gail into falling in love with him and they plan to remortgage her house and buy a hotel business in Italy. After telling her family this, and with Audrey and David disgusted, Lewis (by text) instructs Gail to turn on the DVD of 'Italian for Lovers' which David does. To the family's horror, Lewis has hacked her bank account, taken the money and left the country. Gail meets a man named Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis), who turns up at her house pretending to be a gas man, who has come to the house to look at the \\"gas leak\\". He is revealed as a burglar and pushes Gail, causing her to fall over, and Kylie chases him out of the street, but he gets into his van and drives off. Gail starts to become anxious when she is home alone due to the burglary and is helped by her son David, Kylie and Audrey. However, Gail and Michael gradually grow close as Gail helps him to rebuild his life and she begins to stick up for him in front of David and Kylie. Eventually, Michael moves in with her. In January 2015, Michael proposes to Gail, however, she is taken aback by the proposal and Michael is scared that he had rushed into things and that she would leave him. However that evening at the bistro, Gail turns the tables and proposes to Michael. The celebrations are cut short when Michael collapses and is rushed to Weatherfield General. He later discovers he will require open heart surgery. When Sarah returns to Weatherfield in March 2015, she meets Michael but rudely refers to him as the 'burglar' before shaking hands. Gail and Michael are eventually married in April 2015. However, in June 2015 after Michael receives a photo album from his former wife Susan detailing the life of their son Gavin, it is revealed to Michael that Andy Carver has been posing as his son and the real Gavin is dead. Michael is horrified to learn that Gail (as well as David and Andy's girlfriend Steph) knew about the fake identity and aided Andy in keeping the lie secret. Michael walks out on Gail. Unable to forgive her, Michael later demands a divorce and moves in with his new friend Eileen Grimshaw. Later Michael tells Gail that he and Eileen shared a kiss and Gail and Eileen end up fighting in the street. In July, Gail is upset when Michael and Eileen begin a relationship. Gail stands by David and Kylie when Max's biological father, Callum Logan (Sean Ward), begins terrorising the family, as he wants custody of Max. Gail tries to co-operate with Callum's own mother, Marion, but the mediation sessions between him and David end in failure, worsening the situation as time goes on. After Max says he saw Callum and some other gangsters beating up Jason, Gail forces him out of the house when he stops by for one of his impromptu visits, only for Max to tell Callum he \\"wishes he was dead\\", leading to Callum chasing Max into the road. Max is then hit by Nick in a van. Thankfully, he recovers. Gail's hatred for Callum reaches new heights when he has thugs raid Audrey's salon. Following this, Callum suddenly disappears, and Gail assumes he has decided to leave the family alone from now on. In September 2015, as uncertainty grows about the future living situation at No.8, Gail and David agree to convert the garage into a \\"granny annexe\\" for Gail to live in. After it is finished, Gail discovers there is damp underneath the floor. This eventually dissipates, but Gail begins to notice David, Kylie, and Sarah acting out of the ordinary. She passes it off and officially moves into the annexe. However, in January 2016, Gail tells David and Kylie she wants underfloor heating for her annexe. She gets Jason to take a look at it, but David, frustrated, stops him from doing so, raising Gail's evermore suspicions about her son's temperament. In 2016, it was revealed that there was a decomposed body in the manhole underneath Gail's annexe after a car crash involving Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine). The body was later revealed as Callum, who was missing for a couple of months. Gail considered her family responsible for the murder but looked passed it after it was later said that Jason's father, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) was \\"guilty\\" of murdering him. Gail's daughter Sarah began experiencing mental issues after believing that Callum wasn't dead and was still on the run and coming to kill her. Billy Mayhew's (Daniel Brocklebank) brother Lee ended up kidnapping Sarah before she went into hospital, telling her that Callum is indeed \\"alive\\". Sarah angers him by pushing him into a table, injuring him. Lee pushes her, looking like he is going to rape her and then Gail's son David kicks open the door and saves her from him. Sarah then goes into hospital leaving her newborn baby Harry with Gail's daughter-in-law, Kylie. Michael also later reconciles with Gail after splitting with Eileen, and moves back into No 8. In July 2016, Gail's son David and his wife Kylie agreed to leave Weatherfield and move to Barbados with Kylie's half-sister Becky McDonald. This was cancelled because of the sudden death of Kylie after she was stabbed by Clayton Hibbs after protecting Gemma Winter (Dolly Rose-Campbelle). Gail and her family grieved following this especially David, Max, and Lily. These memories bring Gail back from her first husband Brian when he was stabbed thirty years ago. In October 2016, Gail was horrified by David as he tried to kill Clayton and himself by crashing into his police van with his car full of petrol and by lighting a flame. Gail later found a suicide video, by David, stating that he didn't want to upset the kids but was doing this for Kylie. Gail's method for preventing David from suicide was by trapping him in the Bistro's wine cellar during the trial. David later escaped the cellar and ended up crashing into Gary Windass (Mikey North) and his own daughter, Lily. They both survived but soon after the explosion, Gary's mother Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) got caught up in flames after she fell into a petrol puddle and ended up receiving serious burns to the legs. Gail understood to not ask further questions to David as he felt terrible about it all. In November 2016, Michael is found dead after Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) allowed him to die of a heart attack. Gail is devastated, and she and Eileen put aside their differences for Michael's funeral. Michael is cremated off-screen, and Gail scatters his ashes into a pond near to where they were planning to renew their vows. In January 2017, Gail's granddaughter Bethany, begins dating an older man called Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) who ended up only being with her to exploit her and groom her. At the same time, David becomes involved with new girl, Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding), who was also involved with Nathan. In May 2017, Gail begins pairing up David and fellow hairdresser Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) after believing that they had feelings for each other and were the \\"perfect match\\". David and Maria find out about Gail's plans and agree to mess with her. They pretend to be engaged and in love and later take it to the next level and pretend that Maria is pregnant with David's baby. Audrey discovers that they are lying to them and tells Gail. Gail pretends to organise the wedding plans and David tells her that it was all a joke. In June 2017, Gail discovers that Bethany has been involved in a sex ring and is horrified. After believing that Nathan doesn't really love her, Bethany leaves him and gets him arrested. Gail's precious son Nick decides to leave Weatherfield for good because he has nothing left in Weatherfield. They have a touching moment together. Gail's son David and Shona get closer and share a kiss in hospital together. This annoys Gail because she knows that Shona is the mother of Kylie's killer Clayton. She warns Shona to stay away and even offers her £600 to make her move away. Shona ends up telling David the truth and she leaves Weatherfield after being upset by David. David finds out that Gail knew about everything and kicks her out of his house, but eventually lets her back in. In 2018, Gail finds out Pat Phelan watched Michael die. Casting Actress Helen Worth was cast as Gail Potter in 1974. The role of Gail was initially intended to be very minor, a friend of the more established character Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones), who was introduced as part of a new family. The Hopkins family made little impact on the show, and, after they were written out, Gail went on to become one of the most popular and high- profile characters in the history of the series. Although Worth was 23 at the time of her casting, the character of Gail was supposed to be 16 when she first appeared. Development=Background= The character of Gail was first portrayed as a teenager who liked to have fun with her best friends, first Tricia, then later Suzie Birchall (Cheryl Murray). However, following her first marriage to mechanic Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) her storylines have seen her constantly suffer many blows and misery. She has had five husbands, three children, and four grandchildren, although her grandson died in infancy. Her storylines have seen her feuding with a domineering mother-in-law, deal with affairs, three divorces, being widowed three times, deal with traumas from each of her children, marry a serial killer who in turn tried to kill her and her family, and even been imprisoned to await a murder trial after being falsely accused of murdering her fourth husband. Throughout each of these ordeals, her personality altered from laid back to a bitter, miserable, whiny and bossy woman, a clone of her former mother-in-law Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie). She has been known to interfere in her children's lives as family is important to her and she didn't come from a stable family background. Her mother gave birth to her at 18 because she thought it would help her get the baby back that she had been forced to give up for adoption two years previously. Gail's father was never told about her and as a result, she was mostly brought up by her grandmother or to fend for herself while her mother went out with a string of men. This caused Gail to become a headstrong, independent young woman. However, she always swore that her own children would have a proper family life, living with both their parents. However this hasn't worked out and she has been left with repeated failed marriages and being a single mother to her children. In early storylines, Gail appeared to know both her parents and it was suggested they were married. At the time of her affair with Roy Thornley in the episode broadcast on August 30, 1976, she was particularly anxious about what her father would think, stating that he always read the newspaper out loud to her mother over breakfast.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXqnZUmwqUw However, as the character of Gail became more established and prominent in the series, her background was 'retconned' to introduce her single mother Audrey and to provide a more consistent back story. She interferes in her children's lives, thinking she is helping and knows what's best, causing many arguments in the process and feuding with whoever gets involved with her children, just like her own relationship with Ivy. Particularly after marrying a serial killer and putting her children's lives in danger, Gail's interfering has increased immensely. Actress Helen Worth has stated that she loves Gail's storylines as the many traumas give her great opportunities as an actress. =Feud with Eileen Grimshaw= The character's feud with neighbour Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) arose when Eileen's son, Todd (Bruno Langley) gave up his university course to remain with Gail's daughter Sarah-Louise (Tina O'Brien); Sarah later married Eileen's older son, Jason, but the marriage soon broke up. Various things, including the 2010 tram crash, have caused them to put aside their differences. Cleaver has commented, \\"Eileen's relationship with Gail is horrendous [...] I love all the scraps in the street with Gail. Helen Worth (Gail) and I love doing all that – we have such a laugh with the abusive comments we make for each other. The constant battle is fun. It's a love-hate relationship.\\" Worth has suggested that Gail probably thinks she is \\"a little better than Eileen\\". Jenny Platt, who played Violet Wilson, has noted that \\"Gail's found her nemesis in Eileen, but it's so stupid because actually they are so similar. They are both single mums looking out for their kids.\\" In June 2015, they fought in the street after Gail discovered Eileen had kissed her estranged husband Michael. =Relationship with Joe McIntyre= In 2008, Gail began a relationship with Joe McIntyre portrayed by Reece Dinsdale. The relationship was rocky just like most of other Gail's relationships but the two characters later went on to marry. Conclusion to the storyline and ending of the relationship resulting in Joe's death. In November 2009, The Sun reported Joe would decide to disappear on a boating holiday in the Lake District after experiencing a debt crisis which begins to spiral out of control, in a surprise twist, Joe ends up losing his life for real when a sail pole knocks him unconscious and into freezing cold water before he can carry out his plan in full. The plot mirrored real-life case of fraudster John Darwin, who faked his own death while out canoeing before turning up alive five years later in December 2007. A source said: \\"It's a copycat storyline of Darwin's insurance scam. Corrie bosses have decided that Joe will meet a watery end. He decides to fake his own death to avoid his crippling debt problems and leave wife Gail with the proceeds from his life insurance.\\" Speaking of how Joe compared to Gail's other husband, Helen Worth said; \\"On paper, Joe looks quite normal! He's like any other normal man with problems and they're getting on top of him. Gail will share those problems. Like she says, when Gail marries him, Joe's problems become her problems and that's the way it should be. That sums their relationship up, really. She'll do anything for him because Gail can't let her dream go. To realise that he's the wrong man would spell the end of her dream, so she's not going to do it.\\" In 2009, Worth revealed in an interview with the Daily Mirror that she thought Coronation Street bosses were going to write the character out of the soap as an upcoming storyline would see her on trial for murder: \\"At the time I was genuinely anxious as to whether it was the end of the road for me and Coronation Street... I wasn’t shocked, because it can happen to an actor at any time. But I was very pleased when I found out that whatever happens at Gail’s trial, I will be staying in the show.\\" =Relationship with Michael Rodwell= Les Dennis portrayed Michael Rodwell Les Dennis joined the show in 2014, as Michael Rodwell, who was being lined up as a love interest for Gail.Coronation Street: Gail McIntyre for romance with Les Dennis character? Michael arrived in Weatherfield and burgled Gail's house, but returned later in the year to try to make amends with Gail as part of a restorative justice storyline. (The restorative justice scheme involves people who have admitted crimes meeting their victims or making amends by doing some sort of remedial work.) Gail would sacrifice everything for her relationship with Michael, in particular her relationship with son Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) who disapproved of the relationship. After just over two years, Rodwell was written out of the series, dying of a heart attack. Reception On 25 May 2014, Worth won \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" at The British Soap Awards 2014 for her portrayal of Gail over the last 40 years. On 9 June 2014, a 30-minute documentary entitled \\"Gail & Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street\\" was aired at 20:00 dedicated to Worth's 40 years on the soap. In the show, Worth was reunited with past actors Brian Capron (Richard Hillman) and Amanda Barrie (Alma Halliwell), and spoke out about Gail's most controversial storylines.

The exhibition provided exhibits, entertainment and amusements indoors in the buildings on site and outdoors on the grounds. The Central Canada Exhibition Association operated a fair annually from 1888 until 2010, except during World War II. The fair was on hiatus due to plans to redevelop Lansdowne Park and the Association continued to work towards finding opportunities to bring back SuperEX. It was announced in December 2015 that the Ottawa SuperEX board had disbanded a year earlier and the Ex would not be returning. History Single exhibitions were held on the site in 1875, 1879, 1883 and 1888. The last of these exhibitions was opened on September 20, 1888 by Charles Magee, President of the Exhibition Association, with Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and Governor General Lord Stanley in attendance. A decision was made to formalize an ongoing annual fair, resulting in the 1888 special event becoming the first of the annual fairs. The 1888 Exhibition Association evolved into a permanent organization, and a lease of the site was agreed to with the City of Ottawa. Only a few buildings existed at the site at the time, including the first Grandstand, overlooking a dirt track and horse display area. This dirt track and horse display area has evolved into today's Frank Clair Stadium. The primary focus was on agricultural displays, but exhibits included manufacturer's exhibits from the beginning. Livestock was brought to the site and kept in sheds for the duration of the fair. Farm crafts and baking were judged. The Exhibition operated annually, with the exception of several years during World War II, when the grounds were used by the Canadian military. In 1898, the Aberdeen Pavilion opened for displays. In 1903, the Coliseum opened for displays. In 1909 a new steel and concrete Grandstand was built at a cost of $100,000 to provide seating for nearly 10,000 people. The south side stands were built in 1960. Today's Civic Centre and Grandstand opened in 1967. Starting in 1974, the Exhibition Association worked to move the Exhibition to a new location, but the Exhibition never moved and in 1994, the City of Ottawa directed the Association to stop searching for a new location. During the period from 1974 to 1994, funds were set aside for the move, and several buildings fell into decline, notably the Aberdeen Pavilion. After the decision was made to keep the fair in place, the Aberdeen Pavilion was restored. Over time, the Exhibition reduced its agricultural exhibits to the point where there was only a small exhibit in the Aberdeen Pavilion. Musical concerts took place outdoors on the field and indoors in the Civic Centre arena. The Ex was cancelled for 2011 because it had no site. The exhibition was to move to Albion Road, but the venue would not be ready for August 2011. It was the first time the exhibition has been cancelled since World War II. The suspension of the Ex left its existence in question, with no event held in 2012, 2013, 2014 or 2015. However, the Board continued to work towards finding opportunities to bring back SuperEX. It was announced in December 2015 that the Ottawa SuperEX board had disbanded a year earlier and the Ex would not be returning. Venues SuperEx has a handful of buildings that survived re-development: * Aberdeen Pavilion was built in 1898 by Moses C. Edey and designated as historic building * Horticulture Building was built in 1914 to replace Horticulture Hall from 1879 and 1888; it was a curling rink in the 1960s and was relocated with re-development of the site * Eddie Friel Building (which was west of the south-side stands and housed locker rooms, Rough Rider / Renegade's offices and workout equipment) was demolished after 2012 re- development of the site Most other structures at the site have disappeared: * Ladies and Arts Building - built c.1879, burned down in a fire in 1907 * Manitoba Hall - c.1880s * Experimental Farms Building - burned down in a fire in 1907 * Stock and Poultry Building - built 1905 and replaced by Livestock Building in 1950 * Dairy Building - built c. 1880s and replaced in 1903 and 1905; last structure burned down in a fire in 1907 * Grandstand - built c.1888 and burned down in a fire in 1907; replacement torn down for Frank Clair Stadium in 1967 * Machinery Hall - built c. 1888 was replaced in 1920 (which burned down in 1944) * Bandstand - built c. 1880s burned down in 1907 and replacement torn down for Frank Clair Stadium in 1967 * Press Building - built 1920 * General Purpose Building - built 1944 and later became curling rink 1961; it was demolished in the 1990s * McElroy Building - built 1957 and became curling rink in 1963; it was demolished in the 1990s * Manufacturers Annex - built 1953; it was demolished in the 1990s * Pure Food Building - built 1955; it was demolished in the 1990s * Demonstration Building - torn down for Frank Clair Stadium in 1967 With the re-development of Lansdowne Park, most of the remaining structures were demolished after 2012.http://www.dailycommercialnews.com/cgi- bin/top10.pl?rm=show_top10_project&id;=010f13b47caea5aeccbb976ad9223e11b1f7228f&projectid;=9091636&region;=ontario SuperEx would not be a tenant in the new development and would need to relocate. It was announced in December 2015 that the Ottawa SuperEX board had disbanded a year earlier and the Ex would not be returning. Midway Century Wheel. Time Machine ride at the 2005 exhibition. A highlight of the annual fair were the 'thrill rides.' These were set up on site by the rides provider, and dismantled after the fair is over. Ride safety was monitored by the Technical Safety Standards Authority of Ontario. From 1997 to 2010, World's Finest Shows, the former Conklin Shows of Brantford, Ontario, provided rides along with Campbell Amusements and Homeniuk Amusements. Prior to 1997 Amusements of America and World of Mirth Shows provided the midway. Rides were offered since the first year of the fair. =Accident= In August 1998, Jerome Charron, recent graduate of École Secondaire Publique Charlebois, died in a reverse bungee ride accident at the Ottawa Exhibition when he was hurled 40 meters into the air before plummeting to his death after his harness detached. In February 2000, the firm responsible for the ride, Anderson Ventures, was fined $145,000 for this incident. Provincial inspectors had inspected the ride just 4 days before the incident and had approved it. = Ottawa Midway Magic and the Capital Fair= While no fair or exhibits were held in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the former midway provider for SuperEx set up an annual midway of rides during the August time frame of SuperEx, called \\"Ottawa Midway Magic.\\" In 2011, it was held in the parking lot at Ottawa's baseball stadium. In 2012 and 2013, it was held at grounds adjacent to Rideau Carleton Raceway. In 2014, Ottawa Midway Magic was retired and the annual Gloucester Fair moved into the SuperEx time slot. It was renamed \\"the Capital Fair\\". Concerts The Ottawa SuperEX attracted many musical performances. Stages included the Chez Stage, the Pizza Pizza Stage, the Direct Energy Pure Country Pavilion, the Giant Tiger stage and the SUPER Stage. In 2005, the Solo Mobile / Eckored tour stopped at Lansdowne Park on August 25 to perform at the Ottawa SuperEX. It featured four solo female singers: Keshia Chanté, Amanda Stott, Christine Evans and Cassie Steele. They played on the SUPER Stage at 20h, and the concert was included at no extra charge with the SuperEX admission. Hedley, Massari and other artists performed at SuperEX in 2006. Like the Keshia Chanté concert, only an admission to SuperEX was required to attend the concert. While The Rolling Stones played at the Frank Clair Stadium during the SuperEX of 2005, the show required a separate ticket. The \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic concert on August 22 took place in the Ottawa Civic Centre and also required a separate admission, as did other concerts over the latter years.

M. Coetzee. In this novel, Elizabeth Costello, a celebrated aging Australian writer, travels around the world and gives lectures on topics including the lives of animals and literary censorship. In her youth, Costello wrote The House on Eccles Street, a novel that re-tells James Joyce's Ulysses from the perspective of the protagonist's wife, Molly Bloom. Costello, becoming weary from old age, confronts her fame, which seems further and further removed from who she has become, and struggles with issues of belief, vegetarianism, sexuality, language and evil. Many of the lectures Costello gives are edited fragments that Coetzee had previously published. The lessons she delivers only tenuously speak to the work for which she is being honored. Of note, Elizabeth Costello is the main character in Coetzee's academic novel, The Lives of Animals (1999). A character named Elizabeth Costello also appears in Coetzee's 2005 novel Slow Man and Coetzee's 2011 short story Lies is about a woman with the last name Costello. Summary A renowned writer, Elizabeth Costello has to put up with a large number of various inconveniences. First of all, she is a sixty-six-year-old woman who has committed all her life to writing, often neglecting not only her own needs but her children in order to give all her strengths to her work. Due to the fact that her first novel is about women's liberation, her interviewers – usually women who write books about her – expect that she will be an energetic fighter for equality, who eagerly discusses the importance of a woman's role in modern society. They are extremely disappointed to see an elderly woman, who is sick and tired of discussing her first book. Accompanied by her son John, she comes to Pennsylvania to receive the Stowe Award. During her acceptance speech, she speaks about Kafka and the audience finds it difficult to follow her idea, for this kind of talk is not to their liking. It seems that there is a gap between her and her audience. Although public speaking becomes a challenge for her, she decides to take a cruise in which she is supposed to speak about realism. The applause she gets is unenthusiastic. Not only the does the public not understand what she wants them to realize, but neither does her own family. Elizabeth's vegetarianism often provokes quarrels between her and her daughter-in-law. Her son is torn between love for his mother and difficulties in accepting her point of view. More often than not, he asks himself why she can't be just like any other elderly woman. The truth is that she doesn't know the answer herself. She speaks about the things people don't want to know, because she feels the need to do it. Elizabeth has a sister she hasn't seen for a long period of time. She lives in Africa and serves in the Marian Order. The sisters have a very little in common. During the graduation ceremony they both are invited to, Blanche criticizes the humanities. Their parting is bitter, for they know that they see each other for the last time. Blanche says that Elizabeth chooses the wrong Greeks, which means that she doesn't support philosophical ideas her sister is so fond of. For now, Elizabeth is in a certain kind of limbo, where she is supposed to explain what she believes in, so that she could pass through the gate. She is supposed to do it in front of the court. Her first attempt is a complete failure, for she says the truth and claims that she doesn't believe in anything. She has another try, but the novel ends before she finds out whether she is going to pass through the gate or not. Background philosophy Elizabeth Costello frequently engages philosophers and their ideas. Among the philosophers mentioned by name are historical figures such as Aristotle, Porphyry, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, René Descartes and Jeremy Bentham, as well as contemporary figures such as Mary Midgley, Tom Regan and Thomas Nagel. In addition two minor characters, Elaine Marx and an academic named Arendt (whose first name is not mentioned) share surnames with the famous philosophers Karl Marx and Hannah Arendt. The frequent allusions to philosophers have caused critics to debate whether there are philosophical themes in Coetzee's work and, if so, what they might be.\\" J. M. Coetzee and Ethics: Philosophical Perspectives on Literature,\\" Anton Leist and Peter Singer eds. (New York: Columbia University Press 2010). Part of the debate has focused on similarities between ideas expressed by Coetzee's protagonist and the philosophy of Mary Midgley. Coetzee's protagonist for example is concerned with the moral status of animals, a subject Midgley addressed in her 1983 book Animals and Why They Matter. Midgley has also criticized Marx and other philosophers for singling out one human attribute (in Marx's case, that of freely given labour) and proclaiming it to be the unique quality that elevates human life above that of animals. Midgley argues that this approach confuses a factual claim and a moral claim, and it has been suggested that Elizabeth Costello draws attention to the same shortcoming in Arendt. As one analysis of Elizabeth Costello puts it, “The problem with Marx’s view is that there are human activities in which people find considerable value, such as giving birth, that are capacities we share with animals. Similarly, there are some actions, such as committing suicide, that may be unique to human beings yet that we do not celebrate. Like Marx, Hannah Arendt lauds one particular human attribute, in her case our capacity to take part in a shared world of political speech and action, on the grounds that it is what separates us from animals. There is a certain casual brilliance in the way Coetzee extends Midgley’s critique of Marx to Arendt, whose philosophy is often thought to invert Marxism.” Andy Lamey, \\"Sympathy and Scapegoating in J. M. Coetzee,\\" in J. M. Coetzee and Ethics, p. 192. For similarities between Midgley and Coetzee, see pages 175-81.

Vera is known for her long-standing marriage to Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey); they became one of the best-loved couples in television history. Vera was often shown in a comedic light. She first appeared on 19 August 1974 and last appeared on 18 January 2008, where the character peacefully died in her sleep at the age of 70 from heart failure. She reappeared posthumously for a single appearance on the 8 November 2010 episode, in which her husband Jack died. Storylines Vera first appeared working in the Mark Brittan mail order warehouse on Coronation Street, and formed a friendship with Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie). Vera later moved into the street, much to the dismay of her new neighbours. Although it was originally stated that Vera was divorced, that was later overlooked when her husband Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) was introduced. They argued frequently although she still made an effort with Jack, often using the comically spoken phrase \\"Don't you love me any more, Jack?\\". Despite their problems, Jack and Vera cared about each other. The Duckworth marriage was always rocky due to their wayward son, Terry (Nigel Pivaro), and extramarital flings. Jack once had an affair with Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), and went on a dating programme in which he donned a wig, fake name, Vince St Clair, and French accent. Bet joined the dating programme and was shocked to see Jack's video. She encouraged Vera to go, especially to see a video of a man named \\"Vince\\". Vera and the other girls then launched a plot for her to get even with Jack. Claiming she was a young widow, Vera arranged to meet \\"Vince\\" at The Rovers Return Inn. She was wearing a ginger wig as he approached her from behind, then slowly turned around to face Jack much to the amusement of the pub crowd who were in on the joke. Vera got a job at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) clothing factory – Baldwins Casuals. Vera worked at the factory as a machinist, working alongside many of the street's residents including Ivy, Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix), Ida Clough (Helene Palmer), Shirley Armitage (Lisa Lewis), Ernest Bishop (Stephen Hancock) and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). After working at the factory for many years, Mike sold it in to developers, and it was demolished, leaving Vera out of a job until she had a career change when her lodger Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) got her a job at Bettabuys supermarket, working under boss Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley). When the Duckworths inherited some money after Jack's brother died, they bought The Rovers Return, with Vera becoming the landlady. However they later sold it to Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough). Vera and Jack moved into Eunice Gee's (Meg Johnson) B&B;, and when Eunice moved to Spain to help her sister run a bar, she left Vera and Jack as managers of the B&B.; When Eunice sold the business, Vera decided to slow down a bit and got a job in Roy's Rolls café, working alongside Roy Cropper (David Neilson), Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson) and Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly). Vera's final moments alive (2008) Jack and Vera took in lodger Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) who became somewhat of a surrogate son to them. Vera became restricted to her house due to an injury to her ankle and was cared by Tyrone and Molly Compton (Vicky Binns). They bought her a baby monitor so Jack, Molly and Tyrone could talk to Vera while they were in the pub. Later, Jack and Vera's grandson Paul Clayton (Tom Hudson) arrived on the street but little did Vera know that Paul was scamming Jack and Vera out of money, stealing money from Jack and blaming it on Tyrone. Vera was disappointed in Tyrone but Molly was adamant that Tyrone hadn't stolen the money. Vera refused to believe this of Molly and could never believe that her own flesh and blood could steal from her. Vera decided that she and Jack were to move to their dream place of Blackpool but Paul was forced to confess to Jack that he had stolen the money for the house. Jack was appalled but had to keep it secret from Vera as he didn't want to hurt her and destroy her dreams. Vera still desperately wanted to move to Blackpool so Jack eventually told Vera that he spent a lot of the money they saved to help Paul buy his half of the restaurant, but added the excuse that he spent it before he knew they were going to Blackpool. Jack knew that if he told Vera the truth she would be heart broken and she was still greatly upset and went to bed to get over the shock. One night, Vera complained about her shoes and Jack sat her down and pulled them off. Vera told Jack that she loved him and she had never loved any one else and pushed Jack to say the same. A little reluctantly, as always, he did and grabbed her slippers for her. He then said that he was going to go to The Rovers for a short while and although Vera tried to insist on him staying with her, he said he wouldn't be long and he had been with Vera all day and needed some time to relax. When he returned, Vera had died peacefully in her sleep. Jack remained calm and kept Vera warm. When the paramedics arrived, they explained that Vera had died from heart failure in her sleep but said that she hadn't experienced any pain. Over two years later, shortly before dying Jack sees a vision of Vera and they both dance together. Development Vera alongside Ivy Tilsley, as she appeared in her first scene in 1974 Originally, actress Liz Dawn was only contracted for a couple of episodes, but producers saw potential in the character of Vera and brought her back two years later for another short stint, before finally making Vera a regular from December 1976. The character remained in the series until 2008, when due to Dawn wanting to leave the show because of ill health, the character was killed off. =Jack and Vera= Vera's relationship with Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) was always up and down, they had a rocky marriage and sometimes Jack appeared to show little care for her. Tarmey describes the first few decades in the following manner: \\"He would never knowingly hurt people and he loves Vera, although he doesn't always like her. He will defend her to the death, unless the chap slagging her off is bigger than he is! Jack is not a thief either!\\" In their \\"hey-day\\" they were dubbed as the modern day Stan (Bernard Youens) and Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander). In their early days, Jack and Vera both had their fair share of dalliances. In 1982, whilst Vera was entertaining her own boyfriend, Jack had developed an attraction towards Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear). Jack and Vera waxworks at the Madame Tussaud's in Blackpool They believed the storyline was a turning point for the two and was written with wit. Dawn opines: \\"It was very cleverly written, because Vera knew that Jack had a girlfriend on the side but she didn't know the other woman was Bet. So she chose Bet as someone to confide in, and she really opened her heart. It was quite moving as well as funny.\\" This led to classic showdown in the Rovers. On 23 August 2010, it was confirmed that the actress would make a one-off appearance as the ghost of Vera Duckworth. The episode was broadcast on 8 November 2010. Husband Jack died from incurable cancer and the scene was a reunion for the two characters. Producer Phil Collinson explained his why they decided to include her: \\"It's something I've heard a lot. People say, 'When my mother was dying she saw my father' [...] It's a story I've heard a few people say. We're storytellers at the end of the day. Yes it's Coronation Street and yes it reflects real life, but we're storytellers.\\" Whilst Executive producer Kieran Roberts opined that he would be surprised if anyone thought it was the wrong decision. =Departure= On 23 July 2007, it was announced that Dawn had quit her role as Vera and would depart the following year. Speaking of her departure Dawn said: \\"It's been an amazing 34 years, I'd like to thank everyone for what has been the best time of my life.\\" \\"We're indebted to her for all she has achieved during her years as Vera Duckworth,\\" said Coronation Street executive producer Kieran Roberts. \\"We will always miss this wonderful lady and first rate actress and we are delighted she's agreed to return to the soap in the future.\\" It was originally reported that producers were devising storylines for her character's departure, but will leave the door open for the guest appearances Liz has already agreed to. On 30 October 2007, it was reported that Vera would be killed off with her death being screened in the New Year. A spokeswoman said: \\"Three alternative endings have been written, but each will see Vera leaving husband Jack, family and friends devastated.\\" Dawn admitted that she was pleased that Vera was killed off. \\"It is going to be very emotional filming Vera's death scenes but I do think it is the right decision for the character.\\" Dawn said in an interview. Dawn's co-star Sally Whittaker who plays Sally Webster said Liz would be sadly missed by the cast and the soap would \\"never be the same again\\". Vera's death scenes were screened in episodes aired in January 2008. Reception The Guardian columnist Grace Dent spoke with sadness of the passing of Vera Duckworth: \\"Saddest news on Corrie this month was the passing of street legend Vera Duckworth, leaving her husband and soulmate Jack to wander the cobbles alone. The final era of Vera was actually quite painful to witness. Vera's storyline, spanning 33 years, had no real big bangs or final flourish. Instead, Vera sat quietly, trapped on her sofa, dreaming of a house move to glamorous Blackpool which we all knew would never come. She was still broke, still being conned by errant family members, still one of life's noisy malcontents, but not the formidable force she once was. Regardless, it still felt to me like she'd go on forever, until the undertakers carried her away over the cobbles in a box, while Jack watched from the doorstep in hang-dog faced bewilderment.\\" 12.5 million viewers tuned in to see the departure of the long serving and popular character.Vera's Corrie exit seen by 12.5m – BBC (Retrieved 2008-07-08) Jim Shelley called Jack's death scene with the ghostly appearance of Vera, \\"one of the most moving scenes ever seen in soap\\".

By pressing the joystick button, the mouse can disperse a limited amount of magical dust (called \\"star screen\\") which confuses the rats for about five seconds.

She was originally played by Patricia Cutts; however, the actress committed suicide after appearing in just two episodes in August 1974. Maggie Jones took over the role, playing Blanche in over 830 episodes from 1974 to her death in December 2009. The character subsequently died off screen in May 2010. Blanche was the mother of Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride), grandmother of Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) and great-grandmother of Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney). Her storylines have revolved around her family life, various romances and her \\"acerbic tongue\\". The character's \\"gallows humour\\" has been well received by critics, and saw Jones win The British Soap Award for \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" in 2005 and 2008. Blanche has been described as \\"a true Coronation Street icon\\". Storylines Blanche is introduced as the widowed mother of Deirdre Hunt (Anne Kirkbride). Her bank manager husband, Donald, died in January 1963 after being knocked down outside their house by a black Ford Prefect. Blanche immediately makes her mark by slapping Deirdre's suitor, Ray Langton (Neville Buswell), when she thinks he's treating her daughter badly; she is quick to criticise Deirdre when she disapproves of her behaviour. Blanche originally runs a corset business from home but later takes jobs as a barmaid at The Rovers Return and helps Gordon Clegg (Bill Kenwright) run the corner shop. In 1976, she meets bookmaker Dave Smith (Reginald Marsh), with whom she had a wartime romance. They rekindle their affair and decides to move away to help Dave run his country club in Kenilworth. After her affair with Dave Smith ends, Blanche returns to Weatherfield in January 1977 to help look after her newborn granddaughter Tracy (Christabel Finch), accompanied by Warwickshire vet, Steve Bassett (Dennis Chinnery). They become engaged but split up that May. In 1981, Blanche returns to Weatherfield for Deirdre's wedding to Ken Barlow (William Roache). In December 1993, Blanche has a stroke (off-screen) and Deirdre goes to stay with her to nurse her (a storyline devised to cover Anne Kirkbride's sick leave). Deirdre returns to Weatherfield the following year after Blanche has made a full recovery. Blanche briefly returns to Weatherfield in 1996 when Tracy (now played by Dawn Acton) gets married and again in 1998 after Deirdre is sent to prison, following a wrongful conviction for fraud. Blanche begins matchmaking between the divorced Deirdre and Ken, believing Ken is good for Deirdre. She fails but Tracy gets them to reconcile and in 1999, Blanche returns permanently and moves in with the reunited couple. Blanche quickly gains a reputation as a gossip and a meddler, with Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) often being the target of Blanche's acid tongue when her 13-year-old granddaughter, Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien), becomes pregnant. She makes hurtful comments at Sarah but backs down after the birth of her baby daughter, Bethany, when she finally stands up to Blanche and tells her to leave her and her daughter alone. Blanche briefly becomes Rita Sullivan's (Barbara Knox) assistant at The Kabin but soon drives Rita mad with her meddling and tactlessness. In 2002, Blanche has a new suitor, funeral director Archie Shuttleworth (Roy Hudd) but is unhappy when he makes friends with Audrey. Blanche suspects they are having an affair but later discovers Audrey, a hairdresser, is working with Archie to dress dead bodies for viewings. Archie is angry when Blanche spreads this around and ends their relationship. Blanche is upset but later moves on to supposedly wealthy retiree, Wally Bannister (Bernard Cribbins). Wally is more interested in Tracy (now played by Kate Ford), who simply wants Wally's money and decides to seduce him. This falls flat when Tracy visits Wally's house and discovers that he's actually the gardener, posing as the owner and isn't rich at all. Ken and Deirdre find out and disgusted with their daughter, decide to keep the news from Blanche (who is away visiting her sister) to avoid upsetting her. When Tracy falls pregnant, she tells Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and his wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh), that Roy is the father and tells them that she will have a termination if they do not want to adopt it. Blanche tries to persuade Tracy to keep the baby by buying No. 7 Coronation Street for them to live in, upsetting Deirdre, who wonders why Blanche never bought a house for her. Tracy gives birth to a daughter and gives the baby to the Croppers, who name her Patience; Blanche sees through Tracy's \\"indifference\\" and encourages her to fight for her daughter. Tracy breaks down and Blanche enlists Ken and Deirdre's help to get the baby back. Although they are disgusted when Hayley reveals Tracy sold her daughter for £25,000. Blanche, Ken and Deirdre stand by Tracy, who reclaims her daughter and renames her Amy (Elle Mulvaney). Blanche is relieved when Tracy later admits Roy isn't the real father. When Tracy and Amy visit Peter (Chris Gascoyne) in Portsmouth, Blanche moves back in with Ken and Deirdre, renting (and later selling) the house to Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh). Struggling with a bad hip, Blanche considers using some of the money for a private hip replacement operation but later has the operation in Poland where it is cheaper. In 2007, Blanche supports Tracy when she is accused of murdering her lover Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). When Tracy is found guilty Ken refuses to support her and walks out on Deirdre, who knew Tracy was guilty. Blanche worries that her family is disintegrating and is relieved when Ken and Deirdre reconcile. On 25 June 2007 Blanche holds a mock wake for herself to gauge which of her friends truly appreciate her. She is upset by the low attendance and hearing her friends castigate her negative traits. She resolves briefly to be nicer to everyone but quickly reverts to type, believing people should accept her for who she is. In 2008 Blanche shows her softer side, becoming close to Peter's son Simon (Alex Bain), who finds Blanche's outspoken ways amusing. Blanche is visibly upset when alcoholic Peter turns up drunk to Simon's nativity play and ruins things. In May 2009, Deirdre discovers that Ken has been having an affair with actress Martha Fraser (Stephanie Beacham). When Deirdre takes Ken back, Blanche is incredulous; tired of her mother's interference, Deirdre orders Blanche to move out of their home. She moves in briefly with Peter, returning to live with Ken and Deirdre after apologising a few weeks later. Blanche often makes barbed references to the event, telling everyone at Peter's AA meeting that \\"Ken recently had an affair with an actress. Oh - it wasn't Nicole Kidman or Glenda Jackson. She lived on a tugboat\\". Blanche's tactlessness struck again later that year when Simon's maternal grandparents visited and after one too many drinks, she blurted out that Deirdre had been to prison, Ken had had numerous affairs, Peter was an alcoholic and his fiancée Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) was a former prostitute. Blanche's final scenes aired on 11 December 2009, just days after Maggie Jones' death. In the subsequent episodes, it was revealed that Blanche had unexpectedly been offered a free holiday in Portugal by her friend May and would be spending Christmas abroad. When May hurts her leg Blanche stays on to nurse her. On 3 May 2010 Blanche was due to return; when Peter goes to collect her at the airport he discovers Blanche has died earlier that day, devastating Deirdre. May (June Whitfield) later arrives and explains that the real reason Blanche had stayed in Portugal for so long is that she had fallen in love and become engaged to a man named Arnold. Deirdre is surprised Blanche never told her - and even more surprised to hear Blanche regularly spoke of how proud she was of her daughter \\"Dee-Dee\\". Ken later finds instructions left by Blanche for her funeral, plus a request for a formal will reading. Blanche leaves her dog Eccles to Ken, with a final barbed comment that he shouldn't take her for walks near canals and theatres (\\"where women of ill-repute may gather\\"). She also makes a dig at Ken's attempts to creative writing, leaving him her Maeve Binchy book collection and describing her as 'a proper writer'. She also leaves her jewellery to Deirdre, claiming she knew Deirdre had her eye on it, an imitation silver music box to Amy and her late husband Donald's fob watch to Simon. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) is also invited to the reading but all Blanche has 'left' him is the chance to be the first to spread details of the will around the street, the only time he would get his hands on a piece of gossip before she did. Creation and development=Casting= Blanche was originally played by Patricia Cutts but committed suicide after appearing in only two episodes. The role was re-cast and given to Maggie Jones, who had also auditioned for the part. She accepted the role at short notice, as storylines for Blanche had already been written. Jones had previously appeared in the show in minor roles in the 1960s, as a policewoman and a shoplifter. She appeared in the soap as a series regular from 1974–1976, making brief reappearances in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1996 and 1997. She returned as a series regular in 1998. =Departure and death= Jones suffered long periods of ill- health in 1999 and 2003 and took time out of the show to recover. Blanche was again written out of the series in October 2009 while Jones recovered from an operation but she never resumed the role, dying on 2 December 2009. Co-star William Roache stated: \\"I don't think Maggie ever realised how much she was loved not only by everyone on the show but by the millions of Blanche fans out there. She will be greatly missed\\". Blanche's final scene was broadcast on 11 December 2009, with the 3 December 2009 episode of Coronation Street dedicated to Jones. The producers decided that Blanche would also die. In May 2010 Blanche's friend May (June Whitfield) arrives from Portugal, where Blanche has been staying with her, to break the news of her death. Reception Blanche has been well received by critics and Coronation Street fans. TV critic Patrick Freyne has said of the character: \\"...Blanche is all curmudgeonly gallows humour and insensitivity; she gets all the best one liners....\\" In the same article he also praised the quality of writing for the older characters on Coronation Street: \\"with all the young people wandering around on TV nowadays, with their slang, texting and hippity-hop, it's great to see Coronation Street can still write fantastic older characters. There's prissy, kvetching Norris, long-suffering Rita and saintly Emily. But best of all there's Blanche Hunt, played by Maggie Jones, mother of Deirdre (formerly of the huge glasses) and tormentor of Deirdre's husband Ken...\\" BBC News named Blanche \\"Weatherfield's best-loved battle-axe\\", praising her \\"brutal honesty and withering put-downs\\". The Daily Mirror lauded Jones' \\"superb comic timing\\" in the role. At the 2005 and 2008 British Soap Awards, Maggie Jones won the award for \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" for her role as Blanche. She also won \\"Funniest Performance\\" at the 2009 Inside Soap awards. Jones commented at the time that she did not find Blanche funny, explaining: Pop star George Michael stated that Blanche was his favourite soap character, commenting: \\"When you're as old as her you can get away with saying anything.\\" Following Jones' death, The Daily Telegraph wrote in her obituary: \\"As a deft exponent of Blanche’s withering one-liners and put-downs, Maggie Jones made the part her own, stealing scene after scene as the acid-tongued widowed mother of Deirdre [...] Maggie Jones's portrayal of Blanche as a meddlesome busybody was beautifully judged and finely understated.\\" They deemed Blanche \\"a long-term favourite of Coronation Street fans\\", appraising: \\"With her trademark scowl and folded arms, Blanche epitomised the tyrannical mother-in-law as portrayed on the seaside postcard.\\" Tim Teeman of The Times appraised: \\"To many Coronation Street fans Blanche was a finer battleaxe than the legendary Ena Sharples (Violet Carson). To many (including myself), Blanche [...] was our favourite character. She gleefully defied the maxim that if you hadn’t anything nice to say about somebody, you shouldn’t bother saying it. Instead, she broadcast her malevolence from the rooftops and to her victims' astonished, deeply offended faces.\\" Teeman called Jones a \\"brilliant actress\\" and noted: \\"Blanche could be kind, but not often. She and Norris were the great gossip-mongering tag team of the Street, revelling in others' misfortune. Blanche often didn’t have to say anything at all. She’d just purse her lips. That was withering condemnation enough.\\" Low Culture columnist Ruth Deller praised the work of the late Maggie Jones by stating: \\"even from beyond the grave, she delivered one of Corrie’s best storylines, with the reading of her will providing some classic Blanche moments. She’ll be sorely missed.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Television characters introduced in 1974 Category:Fictional fortune tellers Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Blanche Hunt"},{"id":"2275307","text":"The year 1873 in archaeology involved some significant events.

Just Bring It, known in Japan as , is a professional wrestling video game released on the PlayStation 2 by THQ and developed by Yuke's. The game is part of the WWF SmackDown! (later renamed WWE SmackDown vs. Raw, then WWE and WWE 2K) series based on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) professional wrestling promotion. It is also the sequel to WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role, released in November 2001, and was succeeded by WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth in October 2002. This was the first game in the series to be featured on the PlayStation 2. Gameplay This was the first game in the series to feature commentary, with Michael Cole and Tazz featured as the announcers. One improvement in this game is the appearance of six-man tag team matches, as well as six-man and eight-man battle royals (elimination matches; the latter being the only game in the series until the release of WWE 2K18). Additionally, this was the first game of the series to give each wrestler two finishing moves, as well as the first to allow editing of the in-game wrestlers' move sets. Just Bring It was also the first game in the series to feature authentic, complete ring entrances. The game features several venues from 2000 and 2001, including the arena for Raw Is War and both the original and new arenas for SmackDown! (Ovaltron, including the Sunday Night Heat version, and the Fist stages). However, all pay-per-view arenas (except for WrestleMania X-Seven and Insurrextion) has the same arena with different logos on the ring mat, with the arena being based from WrestleMania 2000. The game's roster was criticised at the time for being outdated, as it was finalised very early in WWF's Invasion angle and prior to the emergence of several former ECW and WCW wrestlers. Whilst William Regal, Raven, Rhyno, Tajiri, Spike Dudley, Jerry Lynn and Molly Holly were new additions to the game, several stars who had become more prominent, such as Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, The Hurricane, Lance Storm and Mike Awesome were not, which was reflected by the inclusion of Fully Loaded 2000 as one of the featured pay-per-view mats over Invasion. In addition to these, Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst appears in the game as a condition of allowing \\"Rollin' \\" to be included as The Undertaker's then-theme music (it is one of his only two game appearances, as he also appears in WWF Raw for the Xbox). This is the only WWF game in which Jerry Lynn appears, as he would be gone from the company within five months of its release. A new gameplay addition is the reversal system. It is a counter- attack mechanic that allows almost every move to be countered, as well as allowing some counter-attacks (such as punches) to be re-countered. =Game modes= Rather than the Season Modes presented in the previous SmackDown! games, Just Bring It has a Story Mode. The player is given more control over their wrestler's activities in Just Bring It's Story Mode, such as having the ability to choose which WWF title to go after. Throughout Story Mode, the player is able to attain unlockables, including additional superstars. Release The game ended up selling more than 400,000 units in North America, for which it was added to the Sony Greatest Hits collection for the PlayStation 2 on 17 October 2002, and became THQ's second Greatest Hits game, only bested by Red Faction. However, when the game was re-released, it was renamed to WWE SmackDown! Just Bring It because of the World Wrestling Federation's recently lost court battle with the World Wildlife Fund, following which the World Wrestling Federation was renamed to the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), although in-game branding was not changed. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. However, the game's in-game commentary has been criticized for being disjointed and repetitive, with noticeable pauses when calling wrestler or move names. Gary Whitta of Next Generation said, \\"Marred by some serious flaws and a jarring lack of atmosphere, Just Bring It still delivers a few rasslin' thrills.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 29 out of 40.

It traces its heritage to a school for choirboys founded in the grounds of Gloucester Cathedral as early as the 12th century and was one of seven 'King's Schools' established, or re- endowed and renamed by King Henry VIII in 1541 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.  History  The current school was officially founded in 1541 as a direct consequence of the English Reformation, by a direct royal proclamation of King Henry VIII. However, there had been a school in the grounds of Gloucester Cathedral ever since it was first built as the Abbey of St. Peter around the year 1100. Today the junior school still educates the choirboys and choirgirls of the cathedral. In 1540, during the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII closed down the Abbey of St. Peter at Gloucester. In its place, by statutes of 1545, Henry established the cathedral and a school known as the \\"College School\\". Henry VIII's statutes required the master of the school to be \\"skilful in Latin and Greek, of good fame, and a godly life, well qualified for teaching, who may train up in piety those children who shall resort to our school for grammar\\". In 1616 the controversial reformer William Laud was appointed Dean of Gloucester. As a result, the school became a victim of the religious disputes which led to the outbreak of the Civil War by 1642. Laud was executed during the war. In 1649, Parliament, following its victory in the Civil War, abolished Deans and Chapters. However, the school was considered too valuable a resource to be dispensed with. After enduring a tumultuous time during the 17th century, the school experienced significant growth from the 18th century onwards. Under headmaster Maurice Wheeler, reforms were instituted throughout the school. Cathedral choristers were fully integrated as pupils; previously they had been educated in separate classes. Physical education was introduced as a mandatory \\"subject\\". It was during his term that the school began to be referred to as \\"The King's School\\". In the second half of the 19th century, the school went into decline, mainly due to financial difficulties, the rise of other public schools and the unwillingness of the Dean and Chapter to maintain more than a \\"music school\\". Through the efforts of then headmaster Francis Gillespy, funds were raised and the pupil roll gradually increased again. More buildings were bought and added to the campus and Archdeacon Meadow was upgraded. The last inspection by the ISI was in 2018.  Buildings and facilities  The school is based around Pitt Street in the centre of Gloucester. It is near Gloucester Cathedral and has assemblies there every morning, which the whole school attends. Most public examinations are held in the Chapter House. The school is based in several buildings: The Palace, the Mathematics Centre, Little Cloister House (the oldest part of the school, containing the oldest continuously used classroom in the world, Sixth Form Centre Dulverton House, (the former residence of the Bishop of Tewkesbury), the Gym (formerly the main school building), the Art, Textiles and Design Technology department buildings, the Science block, the music school, Wardle House (the Nursery) and the Anniversary Building (Junior School). The school is divided into three age groups: * The Nursery, for 3-5 year olds * Junior school, for ages 6–11 * Senior school, for ages 11–18 Pupils are divided into Houses; in the Senior School they are Laud, Wheeler and Serlo, named after, respectively, Archbishop William Laud, Maurice Wheeler, a former headmaster, and Abbot Serlo, an important figure in the founding of Gloucester Cathedral. There are House competitions all year round, including sports, music and quizzes.  Archdeacon Meadow  The school owns Archdeacon Meadow, which is used as a sports field for rugby and cricket for the boys, and rounders in the summer for the girls. House cross-country running is also usually held there. The Meadow was the home of the annual Gloucester Cricket Festival until it was scrapped in 2009.

The eldest son of James Primrose (d.1641), Writer (solicitor) by his second (or third) wife Catherine, daughter of Richard Lawson of Boghall, he succeeded his father, who had held the office for upwards of forty years, as Clerk to the Privy Council on 2 September 1641. Following the victory of Kilsyth he joined Montrose, was taken prisoner at Philiphaugh on 13 September 1645. He was tried by the Parliament of St. Andrews the following year, and being found guilty of treason only saved his life through the intercession of the Marquess of Argyll. Following his release at the end of 1646, he was knighted by King Charles I. Subsequently, he joined Charles II and was made a Baronet, of Carrington in the County of Selkirk, dated 1 August 1651, at Woodhouse, during the march to Worcester. As a consequence of his loyalty to the Crown his estate was sequestrated and his debtors prohibited from paying what they owed to him. He was also deprived of his office by the Act of Classes, the decree against him being sealed on 10 March 1649. Upon the repeal of this Act, and having given testimony of the satisfaction afforded by him to The Church, he was declared capable again of office on 10 January 1651, and was appointed Clerk to the Committee of Estates on 6 June following. At the Restoration he was appointed Lord Clerk Register by Letters Patent dated 7 August 1660, and on 14 February 1661 was nominated a Lord of Session with the judicial title Lord Carrington. At the same time he was appointed a Lord of Exchequer, and a Privy Counsellor. He was the principal author of the Rescissory Act 1661, which ended Presbyterianism until the Act of 1690 re-established it again. The enmity of the Duke of Lauderdale forced him to resign as Lord of Exchequer and Lord Clerk Register on 11 June 1676, in exchange for the far less lucrative one of Lord Justice General. He was deprived of this office in 1678. Primrose died in November 1679, and was buried within Dalmeny church. He and his father between them had served the Crown successively for a hundred years all but one. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son William, whose son James was created Viscount of Primrose in 1703. Primrose's fourth son and namesake Archibald was created Earl of Rosebery in 1703 and was the ancestor of among others Prime Minister Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery.

The action was also known as Operation Dulcinea, the code name given by its chief architect and leader, Portuguese military officer, writer and politician Henrique Galvão, who had been exiled in Caracas, Venezuela since 1959. After United States naval intervention, the ship arrived in Brazil, and the hijacking ended on 2 February when the rebels were given political asylum there. The ship Owned by the Lisbon-based Companhia Colonial de Navegação, the 20,900-ton ship was the second largest ship in the Portuguese merchant navy at the time, and along with her sister ship, Vera Cruz was among the most luxurious Portuguese- flag liners. The ship was primarily used for colonial trade to the Portuguese overseas provinces of Angola and Mozambique, in Africa, and migrant transportation to Brazil. The ship's mid-Atlantic service was also viewed as rather out of the ordinary: Lisbon to Madeira, to Tenerife, to La Guaira, to Curaçao, to Havana (later San Juan), and lastly Port Everglades. The average trade for this gray-hulled ship was mostly migrants to Venezuela and the general passenger traffic. Hijacking On 22 January 1961, the ship had 600 passengers and 300 crew members. Among the passengers were men, women, children, and 24 Iberian leftists led by Henrique Galvão. Henrique Galvão was a Portuguese military officer and political opponent of Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar, the head of the Estado Novo regime. Galvão had carefully planned the hijacking in Caracas with the intention of waging war until Salazar was overthrown in Portugal and the overseas territories were subsequently offered independence. He planned on using the hijacking as a way to bring attention to the Estado Novo in Portugal and the related fascist regime in Francoist Spain. The rebels had boarded the ship in La Guaira (Venezuela) and in Willemstad (Curaçao), disguised as passengers, bringing aboard suitcases that had secret compartments to hide their weapons. In the early hours of 22 January, rebels, along with Henrique Galvao, seized the ship and shut down all communication. One officer (3rd Pilot Nascimento Costa) was killed and several others wounded in the process of taking control of the ship. The rebels forced Captain Mário Simões Maia and his crew to divert the ship eastwards. The next day they called at Saint Lucia, then a British possession, to drop off Costa's body and some injured crewmen in a launch; but, speaking only Portuguese, the sailors were unable to successfully communicate what had happened to their ship until after it had left. The whereabouts of the ship then remained unknown for several days, until an extensive air and sea search by the Americans, British, and Dutch discovered her and established communication in mid-Atlantic. Subsequently, a United States Navy fleet, including four destroyers and , which carried a detachment of Marines from \\"G\\" Company, 2nd Battalion of the 6th Marine Regiment from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina) under the overall command of Rear Admiral Allen E. Smith. The force cut short Galvão's plans, when they surrounded Santa Maria some off Recife, Brazil. The following day, Admiral Smith left his flagship, , and proceeded via launch to Santa Maria to begin negotiations with Galvão. Because of an anticipated change of presidency in Brazil (the incoming President Jânio Quadros being more sympathetic to Galvão's political interests), it was not until the next day that Santa Maria, surrounded by United States naval vessels, entered the harbor of Recife. There, on 2 February, Galvão and his 24 activists surrendered Santa Maria, 600 passengers and crew of 300 to Brazilian authorities in exchange for political asylum. Galvão later announced that his intention had been to sail to Angola, to set up a rebel Portuguese government in opposition to Salazar. Legacy Henrique Galvão wrote his account of the hijacking as A Minha Cruzada Pró-Portugal. Santa Maria (São Paulo, Livraria Martins, 1961), translated as Santa Maria: my crusade for Portugal (Cleveland OH, World Publishing/London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1961). The story of the hijacking was told in the 2010 Portuguese feature film Assalto ao Santa Maria.

He appeared between 1976 and 2006 and in a short special episode for Text Santa in 2012 where he appeared as a ghost sent from Hell to give Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) a warning to change his ways. Mike started his career as a market stall holder but within a few years was running his own factory. In 1976, he opened denim- maker Baldwin's Casuals in Weatherfield and moved there, ending his relationship with his common-law wife Anne Woodley. As an employer, Mike was uncompromising, quick to threaten his machinists with the sack if they slacked and taking a dim view of workers getting above themselves. Storylines Mike's relationship with florist Maggie Dunlop foundered when she became pregnant and she ended things with him when he refused to buy the florist's she worked in. She married Harry Redman shortly before the birth of her son, Mark. The Redmans moved away and Mike did not see Mark for years. One major storyline involving Mike came in 1983 when he had an affair with Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride). Before her marriage to Ken Barlow (William Roache), Deirdre had dated Mike, but decided Ken suited her better. When their marriage became jaded, she turned to Mike. After she had confessed everything to Ken, Mike turned up on the doorstep in the hope of taking her away, but she decided to stay with Ken. This event began the long-running feud between Mike and Ken. Mike went on to marry Ken's daughter, Susan Barlow (Wendy Jane Walker), who was many years his junior. This upset Ken further. The marriage failed because Mike and Susan disagreed about their plans for the future. On discovering that Susan was pregnant, Mike wanted her to become a stay-at-home wife and mother but Susan decided to have an abortion, and moved to Newcastle after just a year of marriage. Mike's on/off relationship with Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie) lasted the longest. It seemed to be over when he abandoned Alma to marry wealthy widow Jackie Ingram (Shirin Taylor), who inherited a factory from her late husband, Peter (who had died of a heart attack during an argument with Mike). Jackie soon saw through him and their marriage lasted one week. Jackie threatened Mike with a shotgun if he did not get out of her sight. A couple of years later, after Alma's relationship with Ken failed because of her feelings for Mike, Mike and Alma finally married. Mike once again had his own business, the underwear factory Underworld. In 1998, Mike was seduced by Julia Stone, who blackmailed him for large sums of cash. When Alma discovered this, she left Mike; once they had divorced, she reverted to her maiden name of Halliwell. Unable to win Alma back, Mike settled with loud- mouthed machinist Linda Sykes (Jacqueline Pirie), who was interested only in his money. His long-lost son, Mark Redman (Paul Fox), came to Weatherfield, and Mike took him on at the factory as manager. However, on his wedding night, Mike found out that Mark and Linda had been having an affair. At first, he blamed Mark but he soon enraged Linda by choosing to spend time with Alma, who was dying of cervical cancer. At this point, he realised that marrying Linda was a mistake. Following Alma's death, he ended the marriage and Linda slept with Mike's new business associate in revenge. She also caused a stir at Fred Elliott's (John Savident) wedding to her mother, Eve Sykes (Melanie Kilburn), and the pressure built on Mike as Mark returned for the celebration. Mike was seen arguing with Linda, who mysteriously disappeared. Mike was arrested on suspicion of murder but Linda was found in Ireland with a new man. In 2001, Ken revealed that Susan had a son, Adam Barlow (Iain De Caestecker/Sam Robertson), fathered by Mike. Susan had been lying when she said she had terminated her pregnancy. As Mike began a fight for access to his son, Susan attempted to escape again but in her haste, she crashed her car on the motorway and was killed. Adam survived the crash and this led to a custody battle between Mike and Ken. Mike was awarded custody, but returned Adam to his boarding school in Scotland, where his friends were. In 2004, Mike's nephew Danny (Bradley Walsh), Danny's wife, Frankie (Debra Stephenson), and their sons, Jamie (Rupert Hill) and Warren (Danny Young), came to live in Weatherfield, where Danny helped Mike run the factory. Many long-time viewers did not like the addition of Danny and Frankie to the cast, as their existence had only been made possible by continuity error; Mike had long been portrayed as an only child and, adding confusion, Mike's father was also named Frankie. In late October 2005, it is discovered that Danny is actually Mike's son, a result of a fling between Mike and his sister-in-law, Viv (Patricia Brake). Towards the end of 2005, Mike was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, aged 63. He soon split from his beautiful girlfriend Penny King (Pauline Fleming), whom he had intended to marry. He once asked Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox) how her husband Len (Peter Adamson) was - when he had in fact died more than 20 years ago. He also went into The Rovers Return and asked where Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) was, not remembering that she had left the pub 10 years earlier. A further misunderstanding caused him to become estranged from Adam. Danny engineered sole inheritance of Mike's empire, egged on by his girlfriend Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Mike's last appearance was in the episode of 7 April 2006. He had been admitted to hospital with pneumonia, but escaped when Jamie left his side for a moment. Making it back to his factory on Coronation Street, he was found by his old rival Ken. Shortly afterwards, he collapsed and died in Ken's arms, after suffering a massive heart attack. He was 64 years old. His passing – like that of Alma in 2001 – was respected with the theme tune not being played over the credits, though a continuity announcement was made. His last words were \\"You're finished Barlow, Deirdre loves me, she's mine.\\" Over the last few months of his life, he had been confusing the past and present: Alma, his beloved former wife who had died in 2001, was often mentioned, as was Bet – he even broke into Bet's former home in 2006, to be confronted by the current resident, a surprised Les Battersby (Bruce Jones). In October 2019, Adam discusses Mike's death with Ken and reveals the irony of Mike dying in Ken's arms. Creation=Backstory= Making his first appearance in 1976 as a Cockney businessman with an eye for the ladies, Mike was the son of an occasional character, Frank \\"Frankie\\" Baldwin, a former docker and Cockney wide boy. He is said to have been introduced following pressure from Thames Television and Southern Television to introduce a character from the South of England, as the series' ratings fell in the mid-1970s especially in those regions. Mike Baldwin became chiefly known for his ruthlessness in business and his string of ruined relationships. During his time on the show, Mike had 25 girlfriends and four wives. Mike's family history was retconned in 2004 when his nephew, Danny, was introduced. Prior to this, Mike was always referred to as an only child. Development=Relationship with Alma Halliwell= Mike and Alma Sedgewick's (Amanda Barrie) romance stemmed back to 1989 and they wed on-screen in 1992, the marriage lasting seven years. It has been suggested in a 2006 ITV documentary that Mike, an antagonistic womanising character, met his match in Alma. William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, has stated that of all Mike's many women in the serial, he always felt that Alma was Mike's true love, the one that was right and good for him. Briggs has stated that he always enjoyed watching the scenes between Mike and Alma, because Alma knew how to handle Mike. Barrie has discussed the way she approached playing the romance between Mike and Alma, suggesting that as Alma she treated Mike in the same way that she [Barrie] treated Briggs off-set, poking fun at him. =Feud with Ken Barlow= Television researcher Helena Robson has discussed the appeal of soap operas and suggested that \\"many soap stories are never finally resolved and conflicts between characters may run throughout the programme's history\\". She used the \\"undying hatred\\" between Mike Baldwin and Ken Barlow (William Roache) as an example of this, suggesting that viewers \\"welcome the sense of stability this offers although the element of change offers as much enjoyment for viewers.\\" It was suggested in an ITV documentary in 2006 that Ken and Mike's hatred was a clash of cultures: \\"Barlow the lefty do-gooder versus Baldwin, the cut-and- thrust money grabber.\\" Briggs has claimed that Ken was jealous of Mike because he was rich and successful while Ken was not, and Roache has claimed that the reason Ken disliked Mike was because he was a self-centred and self-made individual. Old Trafford football ground. In 1983, fans watching the match were informed that Deirdre was staying with Ken when the scoreboard flashed \\"Ken 1, Mike 0\\". Ken's feud with Mike—spanning over 20 years—began in 1983, when Ken discovered that his wife, Deirdre, was having an affair with Mike. Of the love triangle storyline, Briggs has said, \\"the way it captured the nation was amazing. Everyone was talking about it and the pubs were empty. Men were shouting out: 'Go on Mike, give her one.' People were disappointed when she went back to Ken\\". Alt URL The storyline had significant cultural impact, with the press claiming that the country was divided between those who thought Deirdre should remain with Ken, and those who thought she should leave with Mike.Hobson 2008, p.46. In her 2003 book, Hobson suggested that Ken \\"spent at least nineteen years unable to cope with the sense of rejection and betrayal\\" caused by Mike's and Deirdre's affair.Hobson 2003, p.129. Scriptwriters capitalised on the rivalry between the characters when, in 1986, Mike married Ken's daughter Susan, a union that Ken strongly opposed. Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured, and Briggs has suggested that they became famous for their brawls. The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986, when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike's maltreatment of his daughter. Of the confrontation, Briggs has said, \\"It was a classic – Baldwin getting it in his own territory, the factory. It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter, he was furious. He marched into the office and let him have it. This was one of those rare times he caught Mike off-guard.\\" Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken, though it took a further four years before he could do so on-screen. In a scene which aired in 1990, Mike punched Ken, knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house. Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on- screen fistfights, and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts. According to Briggs, no choreographers were ever used. In 1998 one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards. Mike and Ken were forced to work together in 2000, when they were featured in a storyline dubbed the \\"Freshco siege\\". Ken and Mike were among several series regulars held up at gunpoint in the soap's local supermarket, where Ken had been working as a trolley pusher. The episode was broadcast after the 9 pm watershed due to its depiction of violence. Ken and Mike were bound together by armed robbers, which facilitated an end to their feud; Ken helped Mike to combat a panic attack. The pair resolved to put the past behind them; it was a temporary reprieve. Mike had unknowingly fathered a son, Adam, during his brief marriage to Susan Barlow; she kept the baby a secret from him. Mike discovered Adam's existence in 2001; Susan attempted to flee, but was killed in a motor accident. Then followed a battle between Mike and Ken for custody of Adam, with Ken adamant that Mike should not look after his grandson. The feud came to an end on-screen in 2006, when Briggs quit the role of Mike. Mike was killed-off, dying of Alzheimer's disease; he died in Ken's arms. In the final scenes, a disoriented and dying Mike was found wandering the streets by Ken, and as Ken cradled Mike in his arms, the rivals talked about old times before Mike died, signifying the end of their 20-year feud. To promote Mike's final scenes, Radio Times released a series of photographs with Ken and Mike re-enacting Arthur Devis's (1807) painting of the death of Horatio Nelson—Baldwin was shown surrounded by his nearest and dearest during his final moments, with Ken prominently positioned next to him, taking on the role of Captain Hardy, Nelson's trusted colleague to whom Nelson famously uttered \\"Kiss me\\" before he died. Producer Maire Tracey said, \\"The fact that Mike dies in Ken's arms says it all. For most of Mike's life, it was his battles with Ken that kept him going. Like two cowboys, they spent their lives sizing each other up. Behind the scenes Bill Roache has even suggested to Johnny Briggs that they should make a version of Brokeback Mountain for the two elderly cowboys. Both Ken and Mike will miss the bust-ups.\\" Reception Journalist Johann Hari, writing for The Independent heaped praise upon Mike's dementia storyline: \\"You can see some of these qualities in the storyline that has just stuttered to a close, the tale of the cracking and breaking of wide-boy Street stalwart Mike Baldwin into dementia and death. A soap can do Alzheimer's perfectly because it can draw on the collected memories of it audience in a way no other art form, except perhaps the epic novel, can. When Mike loses it and starts crying for Alma – the ex-wife who died years ago – we remember her too. When we see him breaking from his dementia-fever for a moment and asking his old flame Deirdre to dance – an almost unimaginably sad scene, as he beams in mid-dance and says: 'This is lovely', while she quietly weeps over his shoulder – the performances are layered with literally decades of shared experience.\\" Grace Dent, writing for The Guardian heaped similar praise on the storyline as she paid tribute to the legendary character: \\"So, farewell Mike Baldwin. Laid on the cobbles in front of the Kabin, this week Mike took his last breaths, clutched to the breast of his nemesis Ken Barlow, witnessed by Rita and Emily, both neighbours of 30 years. A peculiarly fitting end to the cockney king of knickers. He'll be sadly missed. No more Mike Baldwin in his Edinburgh Woollen Mill golfing jerseys and smart-casual slacks sneaking a fine single malt and a lamb hotpot. No more clashes with Fizz over shoddy stitching or scanning the obituaries for wealthy widows to woo. No more boozy afternoons at the 19th hole. Literally the end of an era. Although Mike's decline from Alzheimer's was bleak and harrowing, there were bittersweet moments to his final days. Imaginary meetings with Bet Lynch, Alma Halliwell and his mother. Chess with Chesney and a day out in town with old flame Deirdre. The time, at last, to watch Ready Steady Cook and wear pyjamas until tea-time.\\"  References External links Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional characters with dementia Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional people from London Category:Television characters introduced in 1976 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)"},{"id":"2275339","text":"Located in the Valley of the Kings, Tomb KV12 is an unusual tomb, used originally in the Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, and then again in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties.

A total of 108 of these ships were built between 1943 and 1945—which worked out to an average of one ship every eight days. Six additional AKAs, featuring new and improved designs, were built in later years. They were originally called Attack Cargo Ships and designated AKA. In 1969, they were renamed as Amphibious Cargo Ships and redesignated LKA. Amphibious Cargo Ship USS Rankin (AKA-103 / LKA-103) Compared to other cargo ship types, these ships could carry landing craft, were faster, had more armament, and had larger hatches and booms. Their holds were optimized for combat loading, a method of cargo storage where the items first needed ashore were at the top of the hold, and those needed later were lower down. Because these ships went into forward combat areas, they had Combat Information Centers and significant amounts of equipment for radio communication, neither of which were present in other cargo ships. One of USS Rankin's cargo holds. The upper level is the main deck, with cargo-handling winches visible. The lower level is the floor onto which cargo is combat loaded. In between is the mess deck where the crew eats their meals. As amphibious operations became more important in World War II, planners saw the need for a special kind of cargo ship, one that could carry both cargo and the LCM and LCVP boats with which to attack the beach, and that carried guns to assist in anti-air defense and shore bombardment. Specifications were drawn up, and beginning in early 1943, the first 16 U.S. attack cargo ships were converted from Navy cargo ships that had previously been designated AK. During the course of the war, 108 such ships were built; many of them were converted from non-military ships, or started out as non-military hulls. Attack cargo ships played a vital role in the Pacific War, where many were attacked by kamikazes and other aircraft, and several were torpedoed, but none were sunk or otherwise destroyed. Nine AKAs were present at the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. After the war, many AKAs were put into the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Others were converted for other uses, such as oceanographic surveying, undersea cable laying, and repairing other ships. Some of the reserve ships were recommissioned for service in the Korean War, and some stayed in service during the Vietnam War. Six more amphibious cargo ships, somewhat larger and of improved design, were built between 1954 and 1969. In 1969, the U.S. Navy redesignated all its AKA attack cargo ships as LKA amphibious cargo ships. At the same time, the other \\"A\\" designations of amphibious ships were changed to similar \\"L\\" designations. For example, all the APAs were redesignated as LPAs. In the 1960s, both the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy developed amphibious transport docks which gradually took on this unique amphibious role and today have assumed it completely. The last amphibious cargo ship in the U. S. Navy, USS El Paso (LKA-117), was decommissioned in April, 1994. See also * Attack transport (APA/LPA).

The original recording of the song was considered too long for release on a 45 rpm single, so it was split into two parts.

Audrey made her first appearance on 16 April 1979 and appeared on a recurring basis for three years until April 1982. She returned over two years later in July 1984, before becoming a full- time regular character from 1985. Storylines Audrey Potter makes her first appearance at daughter Gail Potter's (Helen Worth) engagement party to Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten). As an unmarried mother, Audrey is not considered a suitable match for widowed local councillor, Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley). With Alf, she gains respectability and a stable life as she has not shown much interest in her daughter. She marries Alf on 23 December 1985, later enjoying the social status of mayoress and believing herself to be better than the other residents. Audrey attempts to revive her career as a hairdresser and persuades Alf to buy the salon from Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin). Over the years, Audrey mellows from a social climber to a more sympathetic character. The existence of another child, Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce), in Canada, is revealed some years later. She is heartbroken by Alf's sudden death in 1999 but throws herself into work and stands for council herself, retaining her seat until 2001. Audrey is similarly devastated when her best friend, Alma Halliwell (Amanda Barrie), dies of cervical cancer in June 2001. Audrey nearly becomes a victim of her serial killer son-in-law, Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), when he discovers that she is inherited quite a lot of money from Alf. In late 2002, viewers saw him subtly make Audrey fear that she is developing senile dementia by deliberately unlocking doors she had locked, hanging out washing that she does not remember, turning on lights and dropping a dress off to be dry-cleaned. Finally, he tries to kill her in a house fire, made to look like the result of her dementia, with the battery removed from the fire alarm. However, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) rescues her. After Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw), is murdered in January 2003, Audrey suspects Richard is responsible and urges Gail to leave him, fearing for her and the children, Sarah (Tina O'Brien) and David's (Jack P. Shepherd), safety but Gail will not listen. Audrey challenges Richard at Maxine's funeral, accusing him of her murder, much to the mourners' indignation but Ken Barlow (William Roache) believes her, suspecting that chief suspect Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton) is innocent. Archie and Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) are also suspicious of Richard's dealings with his elderly clients. In March 2003, Gail learns the truth and Richard tries to kill himself, Gail and her children by driving them into the canal. Gail and her children are rescued but Richard drowns. Afterwards, Audrey and Gail reconcile. In October 2006, Audrey speaks to her close friend, Fred Elliott (John Savident), just as he is due to marry Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) and tells him that she wishes they were getting married. This upsets Fred and makes him doubt if he should marry Bev but he decides to go ahead. Audrey tells Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) that she will not be at the wedding so Fred borrows Bev's car to visit her. After a heart- to-heart, Fred collapses in the hall and dies. Audrey, accompanied by the police, tells Ashley and his wife, Claire (Julia Haworth). Later that year, Audrey makes friends with Bill Webster (Peter Armitage). However, on Christmas Day 2006, Bill's wife Maureen (Sherrie Hewson) arrives and learns that Bill has been having an affair with Audrey. Bill and Maureen return to Germany but he leaves Maureen and moves in with Audrey, deciding to try to make a go of their relationship. David also moves in after Gail kicks him out. Stephen visits and offers David a job in Italy but changes his mind after Audrey finds drugs in his drawer at the salon. Sarah, her daughter Bethany (Amy & Emily Walton) and Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) go instead but after learning Sarah planted the drugs, Jason refuses to go so Sarah and Bethany go alone. Eventually, Audrey becomes annoyed with David, especially after discovering he pushed Gail down the stairs during an argument and is stunned when Gail will not press charges, and still has a reticent relationship with David. In 2008, Audrey is contacted by Ted Page (Michael Byrne), Gail's father. He does not know about their daughter, so Audrey meets him and tells him that he has a family. He is surprised, but has a surprise of his own - he is gay. In August, Audrey returns from a booze cruise in France with Bill, Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) and Roger Stiles (Andrew Dunn). Audrey did not enjoy the trip, feeling that Bill ignored her. Bill has been drinking so Audrey drives. While driving, Audrey and Janice begin arguing and Janice accuses her of being a fortune hunter and not caring about Alf or Fred. Audrey is furious, even more so when Bill does not defend her. The argument causes Audrey to crash the car and she injures her arm. Disgusted with Bill, she ends their relationship and asks him to move out. Audrey bumps into an old friend, Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska), at a function and is introduced to her dinner partner, Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers). Claudia later tells Audrey that Lewis is an escort and she should give him a call. Audrey, having become smitten with Lewis, contacts him and begins seeing him occasionally. In April 2010, Audrey is not pleased to see Lewis out with Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), which leads to the two women having a bitter argument over Lewis. Later that month, Audrey discovers Lewis's black book with details on all his clients. She is deeply hurt to see that she is no more than a paying customer to him, but when he assures her that he has fallen for her too, she responds to his kiss and they become a couple. Approaching her 70th birthday, Audrey toys with the idea of retirement, as she wants to settle down with Lewis. At her birthday party in The Rovers, she argues with Gail, when she discovers that Lewis was an escort. Annoyed with Gail, Rita and Claudia's interference, Audrey announces that she has found happiness with Lewis. Audrey then decides to purchase a Greek hotel with Lewis and emigrate, much to the amazement of her family and friends. However, it soon emerges that Lewis is a conman after he steals £4,000 from the bookies. On the day of their departure, Lewis' deception is revealed after he is caught kissing Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) and placing fake betting slips in the cash register on CCTV. Lewis flees the country with the money, leaving Audrey humiliated and heartbroken. Audrey is shocked to discover that Claudia's boyfriend, Marc Selby (Andrew Hall), is a transvestite when she picks him up from a police station after he is assaulted. Marc begs her not to tell Claudia and Audrey agrees. However, Claudia mistakingly believes that Audrey and Marc are having an affair which leads to Marc telling Claudia about his transvestism. At a doctor's appointment, Audrey learns that she and Gail have high blood pressure, caused by too much alcohol. Audrey sets Gail a challenge: to stop drinking and see who can last without it longest, and the pair resolve to get more exercise. Whilst power-walking in the countryside, they are horrified to bump into Lewis in a country pub. He runs away when he sees them and they report Lewis to the police. Lewis later goes to Audrey's salon and tells her he did not mean to hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. In a bid to win her over, Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey goes to his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. Gail disapproves when Audrey's grandson, Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), gives Lewis a job as a waiter but Audrey defends Lewis and he later buys her a bracelet as a thank you. Audrey visits Lewis and asks him to stay, while professing her love for him. They spend the night together and agree to keep their relationship secret but when Audrey fakes illness so she can spend the day with Lewis, David, and Gail visit to check she's okay and see Lewis there. Audrey insists that it is her life and throws them out but Gail insists that Audrey does not leave Lewis, then she does not want to speak to her ever again. Deciding to go on around the world on a cruise with Lewis, Audrey attempts to regain full control of the salon from David. David and his wife, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), are reluctant to agree to this as they believe Lewis to secretly conning Audrey again and David does not want to lose his inheritance. During a heated argument, Audrey collapses and suffers a heart attack, brought on by stress. She spends several days in hospital but is released and told to take things easy, which she does. When David tries to speak to her, she ignores him and he gets the message relatively quickly, though she does eventually forgive him. Audrey discovers that Gail and Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) are testing Lewis about whether he really is a changed man. The plan is that Gloria will pretend to be dying and offer a Lewis large amount of money in her will if he leaves Audrey for her. Audrey is shocked and angry but goes along with the plan anyway since even she doubts Lewis slightly. Lewis passes the test and Audrey is smugly delighted. However, when Lewis discovers the truth and confronts Gail, it's clear to Lewis that Audrey knew about the plot, leaving Lewis heartbroken at Audrey's betrayal. Lewis leaves Audrey horrified when he reveals that he was planning to propose to her and he walks out. She calms down when she is reassured by Gail and the family that Lewis would forgive her, especially after being forgiven for his own previous deeds. Audrey is panicky when she returns home and sees that Lewis has packed his things and left. Audrey desperately tries to explain to Lewis but he cannot forgive her and he dumps her. The next day, Audrey furiously tells Gail and Gloria that their meddling has resulted in her losing Lewis. Over the next few months, Lewis plans his revenge. Though Gloria and Gail feel the wrath of Lewis' vengeance, Audrey does not as he still loves her. However, Gail is conned by Lewis when he dupes her into thinking that he loves her after she develops feelings for him. He manages to hack her bank account and then tells her and the rest of her family, in a video message, that he has conned her and fled the country, before telling Audrey that none of this was meant to hurt her and that he still loves her. Creation=Casting= Sue Nicholls (pictured) plays Audrey The character of Audrey Potter was created as the mother of established character Gail Potter (Helen Worth). After appearing as an occasional character for several years, she became a permanent member of the core cast in 1985. Actress Sue Nicholls auditioned for the part of Audrey Potter and went on to secure to the role. At the time the actress had been in many theatre, cabaret and TV roles and was continuing with her career whilst appearing in the show on a recurring basis until she was offered the chance to become a permanent cast member. Audrey made her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 16 April 1979. In 2010, Nicholls said she can't believe that she's been with Coronation Street for over 30 years. She commented \\"It's the best job to have, especially in this day and age when there are no jobs anyway. Everybody wants to be in it so it must have something going for it! I've been so lucky and if I think back over the years all the people have been lovely and the stories have been hot. Being with Amanda Barrie was lovely, and of course Bryan Mosley who sadly died - and it's thanks to Bryan or whoever - if they hadn't married Audrey off to Alf, who knows I might just have been another tart with a heart passing through.\\" =Personality= Of her character Nicholls said in 1991 during an interview with Graeme Kay that: \\"Audrey's not quite as loud and brazen now, I've tried to take her down a bit, which fitted in with the fact that she married Alf, who is quite serious and sombre. Likewise she's brought him up a bit. Some people see in my character things that I don't. I'm stopped all the time by people who say, \\"Isn't she awful to Alf?\\" or \\"Isn't she a cow\\". Development=Relationship with Lewis Archer= In October 2009, actor Nigel Havers joined the cast of Coronation Street as a potential love interest for Audrey. Audrey first meets Havers' character, Lewis Archer when she attends a ball with Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden). Audrey is immediately attracted to Lewis, but is frustrated because she is accompanying Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska). Claudia later reveals to Audrey that Lewis is a male escort that charges women for his company. Havers warned that his role of Lewis has a \\"dark side\\". Havers commented: \\"I couldn't resist the idea of doing Coronation Street. I loved the idea of being Audrey's new man. I'm a huge Corrie fan. I started in Corrie a month ago and I'm there until July. I gather my character has a real dark side but I don't know what it is yet.\\" Nigel Havers (pictured) plays Lewis Archer Lewis and Audrey decide to rekindle their relationship in March 2012. Kate White from Inside Soap wrote that Audrey finds Lewis hard to resist, especially after he has apologised for his previous actions. When Lewis is wrongly accused of taking some money from The Bistro, he plans to leave Weatherfield. Nicholls told White that Audrey feels awful that she too accused Lewis and it is a wake up call for her as she does trust him. The actress said Audrey still fancies Lewis and does not want to lose him again. Lewis and Audrey spend the night together and decide to keep their relationship a secret, especially from Audrey's family, as his \\"past indiscretions still loom over them like a dark cloud\\". Nicholls said Audrey could be making a mistake, and added, \\"You read this sort of thing in the papers all the time, women of a certain age being charmed by these men. I'd ask her to think about what she's doing.\\" A writer for Inside Soap said that Audrey and Lewis are very happy as they \\"bask in the warmth of their revived romance.\\" However, they have to resort to sneaky measures to spend time together to avoid upsetting Audrey's family. When Audrey calls in sick at the salon to spend time with Lewis, Gail and David become concerned and check up on her. They see Lewis leaving her house and realise the pair are back together. Lewis and Audrey decide to go on holiday together and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans to go on a round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract. =Family troubles= In 2010, when Gail's husband Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) is found dead, the police suspect that Gail killed him. Nicholls said that Audrey thinks Gail is innocent. She said that Audrey doesn't believe in any way that she killed him but what she does feel is that the whole story has not come out. The death happened in some way that Gail knows about. Nicholls said she works very well with Jack P. Shepherd who plays Audrey's grandson David Platt. She commented: \\"I do love him - he's a splendid actor and I do love having scenes with him. I hope he does with me. We do laugh a lot despite everything. I'm always saying, 'Oh, David!' a bit like Posh Spice! I like the relationship we have. I have met people who have a better relationship with grandparents, in a funny way. I know that sounds a bit strange but sometimes people who are difficult have more of a contact with another generation. David and Gail have never really connected until now.\\" It was announced in April 2012 that Audrey is to suffer a heart attack after weeks of stress trying to get her salon back. Nicholls and writers have worked closely with the British Heart Foundation to help portray the scenes as realistically as possible. Nicholls has also met and spoken to other people who have had heart attacks to extend her research. Nicholls commented \\"It was important for me to do this right and the British Heart Foundation have been a huge help to me. They kindly put me in touch with some ladies who had suffered similar attacks to Audrey, and it was really useful to be able to speak to them about their experiences.\\" Reception Sue Nicholls won the award for \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" at the 2000 British Soap Awards. At the 2003 British Soap Awards, Sue Nicholls won gongs for \\"Best Dramatic Performance\\" and \\"Hero of the Year\\" for her role in the highly successful Richard Hillman storyline which ran between 2002 and 2003.

The modern city of Uruma was established on April 1, 2005, when the cities of Gushikawa and Ishikawa were merged with the towns of Katsuren and Yonashiro (both from Nakagami District). As of May 1, 2013, the city has an estimated population of 118,330 and a population density of 1,400 persons per km². The total area is 86.00 km². The city covers part of the east coast of the south of Okinawa Island, the Katsuren Peninsula, and the eight Yokatsu Islands. The Yokatsu Islands include numerous sites important to the Ryukyuan religion, and the city as a whole has numerous historical sites, including: Katsuren Castle, Agena Castle, and Iha Castle and the Iha Shell Mound. It is home to the largest venue for Okinawan bullfighting. The Mid-Sea Road, which crosses the ocean and connects the Yokatsu Islands to the main island of Okinawa, is now a symbol of Uruma. Uruma is noted for its role in hosting large-scale refugee camps and the initial organization of local government of Okinawa immediately after the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. As such the city is considered the home of the starting point of the restoration of civil life in Okinawa immediately after the end of World War II. United States maintains four military bases in Uruma, some of which span other municipalities in Okinawa: Kadena Ammunition Storage Area, Camp McTureous, Camp Courtney, and White Beach Naval Facility. The bases cover 12.97% of the total area of the city. Two controversies have surrounded American military bases in Uruma: the 1959 Okinawa F-100 crash which killed and injured numerous students and residents, and the transport of Agent Orange via the White Beach Naval Facility for testing in Okinawa in the early 1960s as part of the classified Project AGILE. Etymology In the Japanese language the name of the city is written using the hiragana syllabary instead of kanji characters because, according to the city, it looks endearing and soft. The name of the city of Uruma comes from a poetic name for Okinawa Island. A folk etymology, which was adopted by the city itself, segments uruma into uru (fine sand or coral in Okinawan) and *ma (island?). Another theory relates it to urumaa, meaning cricket in Okinawan. The Okinawan origin of the word, however, has long been questioned. In fact, it was in mainland Japan that the word was first attested and eventually came to refer to Okinawa. The first known reference to uruma is a waka poem by Fujiwara no Kintō in the early 11th century. He compared a woman's coldheartedness to the incomprehensible speech of drifters from Ureung Island (迂陵島, identified as Ulleung Island) of Goryeo Kingdom, which Kintō called Silla, a practice rather common in Heian-period Japan. However, the association with Ulleung Island was soon forgotten because the reference to Silla was dropped when his poem was recorded in the Senzai Wakashū (1188). Thereafter waka poets only thought uruma as an island somewhere outside Japan with an unintelligible language. At the same time, it evoked a sense of familiarity because the phrase uruma no ichi (market in Uruma) was poetically associated with Mino Province. From the viewpoint of mainland Japanese poets, Okinawa might have been an ideal referent of uruma because, despite the exotic name of Ryūkyū, the first reference to Okinawan-composed waka poems was as early as 1496. The first known identification of uruma as Okinawa Island can be found in the Moshiogusa (1513), but the association remained weak for some time. For example, Hokkaido, in addition to Okinawa, was referred to as uruma in the Shōzaishū (1597). The mainland Japanese poetic practice was adopted by Okinawan waka poets in the late 17th century. The Omoidegusa (1700), a purely Japanese poetic diary by Shikina Seimei, is known for its extensive use of the word uruma. History Nakabaru Site, Ikei Island =Early history= In the Sanzan Period (1322–1429), or Three Kingdom period, numerous gusuku, or castles were built across Okinawa Island. The area of present-day Uruma fell under the control of the Chūzan Kingdom, which covered the central area of Okinawa Island and its nearby islands. The Katsuren area of Uruma became notably prosperous in the mid-15th century. Katsuren Castle, and a surrounding jōkamachi castle town, were constructed in this period. Under the Ryukyu Kingdom six magiri, a type of regional administrative district in pre-modern Okinawa, covered areas of present-day Uruma: 'Nzatō Magiri (parts of which were also located in present-day Okinawa City), Gushichaa Magiri, Kachin magiri, and Yunagushiku Magiri. Nakagushiku Magiri included Tsuken Island. The Ryūkyū Kingdom ended in 1872 with the establishment of the Ryūkyū Domain, which was soon abolished with the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. The existing system of magiri in Uruma continued with the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture. The magiri were abolished in 1907 under Imperial Edict 46, and the central government extended the establishment of cities, towns, and village organization to Okinawa Prefecture. In 1908 the area of present-day Uruma was reorganized as the five villages of Misato, Gushikawa, Katsuren, and Yonashiro. In the pre-war period Uruma had the most productive sugarcane industry in Okinawa Prefecture due to sources of irrigation and fertile soil. The areas of present-day Uruma were affected in World War II during the initial part of the Battle of Okinawa. L-Day, the initial land invasion of Okinawa Island, occurred on April 1, 1945. American forces swept across the island quickly, and by April 5 had secured the entirety of the Katsuren Peninsula. A smaller invasion force captured Tsuken Island on the same day, and encountered stiff resistance from the Japanese military. Tsuken Island was completely devastated by fire in the battle. After the capture of Tsuken, American forces reached Ikei Island on April 9, thus securing all the Yokatsu Islands. The area that became Ishikawa was a major refugee camp set up by the American military near the end of the battle. =Post-war period= 1959 Okinawa F-100 crash, June 30, 1959 The Okinawa Advisory Council, the predecessor to the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands was established in Ishikawa, and temporarily became the political, educational, and cultural center of Okinawa. In 1946 the Advisory Council was moved to the village of Sashiki, now a district of Nanjō, refugees began a large-scale movement to return to their homes, and the population of Ishikawa decreased rapidly. In the aftermath of World War II the Ishikawa area of Uruma was used as a large-scale refugee camp. The camp was built and operated by the U.S. occupation forces, and is considered the starting point of the reconstruction and recovery of Okinawa after the war. The 1959 Okinawa F-100 crash occurred on June 30, 1959. In the crash, a United States Air Force North American F-100 Super Sabre on a flight from nearby Kadena Air Base suffered an engine fire and crashed into Miyamori Elementary School and surrounding houses. Eleven students and six other people in the neighborhood were killed, and 210 were injured, including 156 students at the school. The F-100 crash contributed to ill will among the Okinawan population towards the U.S. occupation authorities, and strengthened calls for the island to be returned to the control of the Japanese government. The city of Uruma was formed on April 1, 2005 from the merger of the cities of Gushikawa and Ishikawa, and the towns of Katsuren and Yonashiro, both from Nakagami District. Economy Uruma, despite its low amount of arable land, is noted for several agricultural products. The city, like most areas of Okinawa, produces sugarcane. Cut flowers, notably chrysanthemums, are a relatively new agricultural product. Land improvement has made small-scale rice production possible. Pigs have been raised in Uruma since the end of World War II. Uruma produces also several specialty agricultural products. The city is noted for the production of mozuku seaweed. Tsuken Island produces a specialty variety of carrots, which are known in Japan as the \\"Tsuken Ninjin\\". \\"Nuchi-masu\\", or the \\"salt of life\\", is produced from the mineral-rich seawater of Uruma. Yamashiro-cha is a locally produced tea grown in the Yamashiro area of the city. Geography Kin Bay viewed from Ikei Island. Height marker on top of Mount Ishikawa.

The Navy pier is in width and in length, and the Army pier is in width and in length. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Okinawa Naval Base is located directly adjacent to White Beach. The White Beach Naval Facility was built at the end of the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. 95,000 military engineers arrived on Okinawa Island to convert the island into a staging area for an invasion of the Japanese main islands. While the island was not used for an invasion of Japan, White Beach remained a permanent military facility. White Beach played a role in the controversial Agent Orange testing in Okinawa in the early 1960s under an American program to test unconventional weapons as part of the classified Project AGILE. Logbooks of the privately owned merchant marine ship SS Schuyler Otis Bland show that chemicals agents were delivered to White Beach under armed guard on April 25, 1962, then transported to other areas of the island.

Background and recording Ringo Starr and musical partner Mark Hudson composed \\"Dear Santa\\" and \\"Christmas Eve\\" in July 1998 at Starr's Surrey residence. The pair of the songs were recorded a few months later, between 14 and 16 September in the UK. Follow-up sessions did not commence till 8 March 1999 at Whatinthewhatthe? Studios in Los Angeles, where the tracks \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\", \\"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\\" and further work on \\"Dear Santa\\", were taped that day. Featured on these tracks were Starr, Hudson, Jim Cox and Steve Dudas. Recorded throughout 1999 between Starr and Hudson, I Wanna Be Santa Claus—which is composed of half-and-half traditional songs and new originals—was made in several studios in the US and UK, with their families joining in and including two notable celebrity guests, Aerosmith's Joe Perry and Eagles member Timothy B.

Music and lyrics The title track is about spreading Christmas cheer on every day of the year, compared to just on Christmas Day. Release and reception Released on 19 October 1999, in the US by Mercury, ahead of the Christmas season, I Wanna Be Santa Claus was not a commercial success, despite its strong reviews. It was re-released on 23 September 2003 entitled 20th Century Masters: The Best of Ringo Starr/The Christmas Collection. Starr left Mercury after they had done no promotion for the album, which in turn resulted in little sales.

The character debuted on- screen during the episode broadcast on 28 November 1979. Jack was introduced by executive producer Bill Podmore. Tarmey had previously appeared as a background character in many episodes featuring scenes in the Rovers Return, including some occasional speaking lines. More than twenty years after first appearing, Tarmey eventually cut down filming due to problems with his health and often contemplated leaving the series. In April 2010, it was announced that Tarmey would leave the series for good later that year. His last appearance was broadcast on 8 November 2010, with ITV also airing a tribute documentary for him. Having been in the show for 31 years, he was one of the longest-serving characters. Jack's storylines have focused on his long- standing marriage to his wife Vera (Liz Dawn) which has been complex and at times been described as \\"rocky\\". Other storylines include coping with his wayward son Terry (Nigel Pivaro) and his hobby for pigeon keeping. In his final storyline, he was portrayed as having incurable non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Jack has been characterised through his \\"joyless and gloomy\\" life in which he has a string of dead-end jobs and his wife's death, but continued to pass witty remarks on life. Television critics have described Jack as a loveable rogue type character and have favoured his relationship with Vera. His exit storyline was fairly documented in the media, receiving positive reactions and many state he is fondly remembered for his love of pigeons. Storylines=Backstory= Whilst Jack is working a fairground ride, the waltzer, he meets Vera Burton (Liz Dawn), and they soon begin a relationship. When Vera announces that she is pregnant with his baby, Jack agrees to marry her. Even after discovering this is a false alarm, Jack still takes her hand in marriage. During a trip to the United States, Jack confesses to being two years younger than Vera is aware, as he had lied at their wedding, making out that he was older than he really was in an attempt to impress a young Vera. Since they had not been legally married, they make their marriage official by tying the knot in the famous Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. A pregnant Vera gives birth to a son, whom they named Terry (Nigel Pivaro). =1979–2010= Jack makes his first appearance on 28 November 1979 when Vera forces him to attend the wedding of her friend and colleague Ivy Tilsley's (Lynne Perrie) son Brian (Christopher Quinten) to Gail Potter (Helen Worth). He returns in 1981 and for almost two years, appears on a recurring basis. Jack and Vera move into the street in 1983, much to the dismay of many of Weatherfield's residents. Prior to Jack's 1979 debut, Bill Tarmey often appeared as an extra in The Rovers Return Inn, playing darts. Jack later has an affair with Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), which he later regrets. Jack enrols with a video dating agency in 1983, referring to himself as \\"Vince St. Clair\\" and obtains a white suit, gold medallion and phoney trans-Atlantic accent. Vera also takes part in this. She refers to herself as \\"Carole Munroe\\", and is shocked when she sees Jack's video. She arranges to meet him in The Rovers Return, wearing a ginger wig, claiming to be a rich widow. When she turns around, Jack is shocked to see his wife staring back at him and she chases him out of the pub much to the amusement of the other customers. Jack Duckworth as he appeared in 1982. Vera is almost tempted into having an affair with Lestor Fontaine, but is soon to realise that she cannot leave Jack. In 2000, Vera worries that she may die in an operation, and confesses to Jack that she had an affair during the early years of their marriage, meaning there is a possibility that Terry is not really Jack's son. Jack confesses to his friend Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) that unbeknownst to Vera, he had knowledge of the affair, and had beaten her lover up; though he claims that he believes Terry to be his own son as he reminds him too much of himself. Terry causes trouble for Jack and Vera through his various relationships with women. He dates neighbour Andrea Clayton (Caroline O'Neill) in 1985 and she becomes pregnant, sparking a feud between the Claytons and the Duckworths. At Ivy's engagement party to George Wardle in The Rovers, Jack asks Andrea's father Harry Clayton (Johnny Leeze) if they are sure Terry is the father and Harry punches him. The Claytons later move away. In 1992, Terry is released from prison to marry his pregnant girlfriend Lisa Horton (Caroline Milmoe) and uses the ceremony to escape. Lisa moves to Weatherfield from her home town of Blackpool and begins a relationship with local bookie Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss) and moves in with him, a decision which infuriates Vera. While Jack is more sympathetic towards Lisa, knowing Terry will never stand by his wife and child, he nonetheless feels he has to side with his wife. Lisa gives birth to a baby boy whom she names Tommy and five months later, Lisa is killed after being run over by a car, and Jack and Vera are delighted when Tommy comes to live with them. Jack and Vera find it hard to cope financially, but Terry takes Tommy off of them and sells him to Lisa's parents Jeff and Doreen Horton and he goes to live with them in Blackpool. Jack and Vera are devastated and a furious argument with Terry follows, resulting in Jack punching Terry and disowning him. Jack and Vera were blessed with another grandson, Brad, after Terry's fling with Tricia Armstrong (Tracy Brabin). Jack also develops a paternal relationship with Tricia's son from her first marriage, Jamie (Joseph Gilgun). Jack and Vera later became surrogate parents for Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall), whose mother had been imprisoned for assault. Jack considers Tyrone as more of a son than Terry had ever been. Jack is fond of pigeons though Vera hates them, and she once tricks him into believing that she has cooked him a pigeon pie. Jack once agrees to sell his dead body for a large amount of cash to an artist (Maggie McCarthy) who enjoys painting stuffed humans, so he could buy Vera a Christmas present. When Vera discovers this, she argues with the woman, who then turns up, inspired by Vera. They agree to both pose nude for the artist, but on condition that they would be buried as normal. The Duckworths celebrate their Golden wedding anniversary with a party at The Rovers in August 2007. After the couple plan to relocate to Blackpool, Jack discovers Vera has died in her sleep in her armchair on 18 January 2008, devastating many of Weatherfield's residents. This prompts Jack to abandon the move to Blackpool and stay in Weatherfield, although he still offers No. 9 to Tyrone and his girlfriend Molly Compton (Vicky Binns); though they insist that he remain as a lodger. Months later, Jack's grandson Paul Clayton (Tom Hudson), having returned to Weatherfield previously, confesses to the police to burning down Valandro's, Leanne Battersby's (Jane Danson) restaurant. He also confesses this to Jack who is disgusted with his grandson's behaviour and tells him that he is Terry's son. Despite his disgust, Jack offers Paul £10,000 that he has received from the house, on the condition that Paul faces prison. However, Paul cannot face it and decides to flee the country. This reassures Jack that Paul is different from Terry. When Molly's aunt Pam Hobsworth (Kate Anthony) later moves into No. 9, Jack decides to spend a few months in Blackpool. Upon his return, he describes at Tyrone and Molly's wedding in January 2009 that Tyrone is the son he and Vera had always wanted. Later that year, Jack meets Connie Rathbone (Rita May), a widow and fellow pigeon enthusiast. The two become good friends, although Tyrone feels that Jack's behaviour is disrespectful to the memory of Vera. Jack soon goes on holiday with Connie to Spain and lies to Tyrone and Molly that he is returning to Blackpool. When he comes back, Tyrone discovers the truth and is unhappy with Jack. Tyrone begins to soften towards Connie but is still shocked when Jack announces that he is moving in with Connie and he leaves Weatherfield on 21 September 2009. Following him moving in with Connie, Jack's appearances on the show became intermittent. In November 2009, Jack and Connie join Tyrone in the Rovers for a drink. After Connie leaves, Jack tells Tyrone that he is worried that she wants more than companionship. Jack then hides out at Tyrone's until Connie catches up with him and reveals it is only a misunderstanding about her sleepwalking, much to Jack's relief. Jack and Connie join Tyrone, Bill Webster (Peter Armitage) and Pam on Christmas Day 2009. Jack is present once again in early-2010, when Molly and Tyrone are having marriage difficulties and is seen in the Rovers after the funeral of Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) in May 2010. Jack appears on 9 September 2010 to visit Molly, after she has just given birth, and is told her and Tyrone's son will be named Jack in honour of him. In October 2010, Jack moves back in with Tyrone and Molly and they suspect that he has fallen out with Connie. Jack initially tells Tyrone that he has simply missed living with them both. However, when Connie turns up at the house and cryptically demands why Jack hasn't told them the real reason for his stay, he is forced to reveal the truth. On 8 October 2010, Jack tells a Tyrone that he has an incurable form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and only has weeks to live, leaving Tyrone devastated. He returns to No. 9 to live out the remainder of his days, and makes Tyrone promise that they will make the most of his last few weeks. During his final weeks, Jack strives to perform acts of kindness for those around him. He sends Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) tickets for the opera after hearing her say that she always wanted to go. After seeing Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) collecting money in the Rovers to repair the roof of the local church, he anonymously donates over £2,000 to the fund. When Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) confides in Jack about problems that he is having with his wife Claire (Julia Haworth), he attempts to reconcile the couple by encouraging them to talk to one another. After baby Jack's christening on 5 November 2010, Jack is devastated when he overhears a conversation between Molly and Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell), in which Kevin reveals that he is the father of baby Jack, and not Tyrone as the result of the affair they had. On 8 November 2010, Tyrone organises a party for Jack's 74th birthday in the Rovers Return. Jack reveals to Molly that he overheard her and Kevin discussing baby Jack's paternity. Jack does not condemn Molly and he admits he and Vera had both done the same as she had to each other, but tells her that Tyrone never would and pleads with her to move the family away from Weatherfield. Later, after seeing Tyrone and Molly happy together with baby Jack, he decides to quietly slip out of his own party saying his final words to Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Carla Connor (Alison King) and then waving goodbye to Ken Barlow (William Roache), who raises a glass to him as he leaves. Jack goes home and whilst listening to a Matt Monro record which Tyrone had given him as a present, he dies in his armchair and is joined by the ghost of Vera, who tells him off, yet again, for his scruffy appearance. She tells Jack she'll be late for a bus and Jack's spirit leaves his body and gets out of his chair and dances with Vera and they share a kiss. Some time later, Tyrone, Molly and Connie return home to find Jack dead in his chair, and a tearful Tyrone says his last words to him \\"Good Night Dad\\". Jack and Vera's ashes are later scattered off Blackpool Pier by Tyrone and Connie. Casting Unlike the creation process with many other roles, no auditions were held for the part of Jack. Actor William Tarmey had previously been an extra in the serial, and in 1978 he played the small credited part of \\"Jack Rowe\\". He was offered the guest role of Jack Duckworth for two episodes in November 1979. Of his previous credits, Tarmey states: \\"I'd worked on Coronation Street for about ten years throwing darts in the background and whilst doing that I was doing little cameo parts, on other programmes.\\" Tarmey was later asked back for a handful of episodes in 1981 and was eventually asked to become a regular cast member a year later. Tarmey had prepared for this with the help of fellow cast members and of this he adds: \\"I've had so many helping hands through the years from Jean [Alexander] and Liz [Dawn] and Julie [Goodyear] and Bill [Roache] [who played Hilda Ogden, Vera Duckworth, Bet Lynch and Ken Barlow respectively], from them all\\". In 1997, executive producer Brian Park axed a number of characters; Tarmey has stated he was so tired of seeing his fellow cast members worrying about their jobs that he asked to be written out, but Park decided to keep him on. In 2001, the serial imposed a series of cuts on salaries as part of cost- cutting efforts. This resulted in Tarmey considering leaving, but producers decided against lowering his salary and convinced him to stay. In 2004, Tarmey extended his contract further along with his on-screen wife Dawn. In June 2008, he spoke of his desire to continue in the role. From September 2009 onwards, Tarmey filmed on an episodic basis. In a storyline, Jack moved away from Coronation Street but continued to make occasional appearances at the Rovers and in the cafe. The reason for this was due to Tarmey's increasing health problems. On 9 April 2010, it was announced Tarmey would leave the show. His final scenes were broadcast on 8 November 2010. On 9 April 2010, it was announced that Bill Tarmey had quit his role of Jack in the show's fiftieth anniversary year. Speaking of his decision to quit, Tarmey stated: \\"I've had the most amazing 30 years playing Jack. Because of him I've made fantastic friends and travelled all over the world. I'll be sorry to say goodbye.\\" Filming Jack's final scenes upset Tarmey, of this he stated: \\"It was delightful. And very moving. It was a case of 'Pass the hand towel' [...] you know, filming those scenes was difficult. I'm leaving my other family. I've worked with all these people for 30-odd years and it was impossible for me to act or watch the death scene and cut that off.\\" Development=Characterisation= ITV publicity describe him as being fond of pigeons and betting whilst disliking household chores. Stuart Heritage of newspaper The Guardian describes Jack as having \\"a constant downbeat aura of a person who knows that his entire life has been a joyless procession of gloomy disappointments.\\" Another reporter of the newspaper, Mark Lawson, described Jack as \\"A pigeon-fancying, flat-cap-wearing, wise-cracking, philandering, Sinatra-loving Lancashire lad, Jack epitomised the vivid character comedy in which the serial specialises.\\" In 1991 Tarmey spoke of Jack's changes in attitude over his early years in the book Life on the Street. \\"Jack has settled down and matured a bit, he has accepted things with a kind of middle- aged resignation\\", Tarmey stated. He also branded Jack's days of chasing \\"birds\\" as over and some of his greatest loves as being \\"booze and barmaids\\". Jack has a \\"strange moral code\\" when it comes to his marriage. Tarmey brands one of Jack's good qualities as being the fact he is not a thief, but did add \\"He regards stealing Alec Gilroy's (Roy Barraclough) beer as one of the perks of his job\\". =Jack and Vera= Jack's relationship with Vera Burton (Liz Dawn) was always up and down, they had a rocky marriage and sometimes Jack appeared to show little care for her. Tarmey describes the first few decades in the following manner: \\"He would never knowingly hurt people and he loves Vera, although he doesn't always like her. He will defend her to the death, unless the chap slagging her off is bigger than he is! Jack is not a thief either!\\" In their \\"hey-day\\" they were dubbed as the modern day Stan (Bernard Youens) and Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) In their early days, Jack and Vera both had their fair share of dalliances. In 1982, whilst Vera was entertaining her own boyfriend, Jack had developed an attraction towards Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear). Tarmey recalls the scenes in which Jack and Bet flirt, stating he was nervous and had to have Goodyear's help. They believed the storyline was a turning point for the two and was written with wit. Dawn opines: \\"It was very cleverly written, because Vera knew that Jack had a girlfriend on the side but she didn't know the other woman was Bet. So she chose Bet as someone to confide in, and she really opened her heart. It was quite moving as well as funny.\\" This led to a classic showdown in the Rovers. Jack and Vera Duckworth waxworks at Madame Tussauds in Blackpool, Lancashire - 2018 In another storyline Jack's son Terry sells his baby Tommy Duckworth (Darryl Edwards), leaving Jack and Vera devastated. When Jack and Vera realise what he has done, Jack punches Terry. The scenes made viewers happy to see Terry getting what hurt. Tarmey himself felt sadness because he knew how Jack felt: \\"When I first saw the script I was very sad [...] I worked out the punch with Nigel and I missed him by a whisker. Since then I've had letters saying \\"Well done for cracking him one\\" from little old ladies, young women, kids, guys.\\" On 8 November 2010 Tarmey made his final appearance, with Jack dying in his armchair at his old Coronation Street house, following a birthday party at the Rovers. In Jack's final death scene he sees visions of Vera, which Dawn returned to film. Producer Phil Collinson explained why they decided to include her: \\"It's something I've heard a lot. People say, 'When my mother was dying she saw my father' [...] It's a story I've heard a few people say. We're storytellers at the end of the day. Yes it's Coronation Street and yes it reflects real life, but we're storytellers.\\" Whilst Executive producer Kieran Roberts opined that he would be surprised if anyone thought it was the wrong decision. In other media Jack appears in a theatrical version of the story of Coronation Street titled \\"Corrie!\\" in which Jack and Vera are shown as Terry sells their grandchild. Reception In January 1985, David Porter of current affairs magazine, Third Way, criticised Coronation Street's attitude towards employment, stating that being unemployed seemed to not be a problem for some characters as they were either \\"loved layabouts\\" or \\"acknowledged rogues\\", like Jack. In Dorothy Catherine Anger's book Other worlds: society seen through soap opera she brands Jack as one of the \\"middle aged men\\" who \\"over the years have, stymied their wives' efforts to be accepted as respectable\\". Dorothy Hobson in her book Soap Opera stated that marriages never seem to last in the genre, but added that Jack and Vera were an exception, in her opinion it was because although he loved her, he was terrified of sex. Ian Wylie of The Guardian branded Jack and Vera as \\"one of TV drama's most enduring – and real – double acts\\". Channel Five's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap brands Jack's most memorable moments as being \\"his Vince St Clair alias\\" and \\"when Jack returned home to find Vera had died in her sleep.\\" The website has also branded him a \\"pigeon fancier\\" What's on TV describe Jack stating: \\"Had a famously rocky marriage to Vera but widower Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey) has mellowed over the years. Once a bit of a jack- the-lad, he's now more of a 'Jack the kipper', as he's enjoying retirement and taking life easy.\\" TV critic Jim Shelley for the Daily Mirror spoke of his regret that Jack Duckworth would be leaving the show: \\"Soap characters come and go, but it's a genuine shame that, after 31 years, Bill Tarmey is finally leaving Coronation Street. It's hard to think of a more popular or nicer character than Jack Duckworth. Decent people are few and far between in soaps. Viewers loved Stan and Hilda Ogden for example. But you couldn't say that they were as warm or reassuring a presence as Jack. Of course he was part of one of the great loving couples/double acts in Street history.\\" 11.64 million viewers tuned in to see Jack's final appearance. Jack's final scenes on the show were praised by fans and critics alike. Jim Shelley called Jack's death scene with the ghostly appearance of Vera, \\"one the most moving scenes ever seen in soap\\". Mark Lawson of The Guardian described Jack and Vera's last dance as a great piece of social realism. As a tribute to the character ITV broadcast a short documentary profiling Jack's life in the serial. 7 million viewers tuned into watch the show. Stuart Heritage of The Guardian stated that Jack had iconic accessories which are his \\"golden-era glasses\\" stuck together with Elastoplast and his vest. They also commented on his pigeon keeping hobby, stating: \\"Forget Vera Duckworth, the one true love of Jack's life was his flock of pigeons.\\" Lucy Mangan writing for The Guardian reviewed the serial's theatrical piece Corrie!, stating: \\"The scene in which Terry arrives to take his son away from grandparents Jack and Vera is enough to precipitate a Proustian rush of tearful memories. All those years of misery the wretched Terry caused his parents – oh, Jack's bitter resignation! – come flooding back.\\" In the Morley Observer & Advertiser a columnist expressed their disappointment Jack and Vera were onscreen when he wanted to watch football and opined \\"difference is that the dramatic acting in the football is better\\".

Endostatin is a naturally occurring, 20-kDa C-terminal fragment derived from type XVIII collagen. It is reported to serve as an anti-angiogenic agent, similar to angiostatin and thrombospondin. Endostatin is a broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor and may interfere with the pro-angiogenic action of growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Background Endostatin is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. It was first found secreted in the media of non-metastasizing mouse cells from a hemangioendothelioma cell line in 1997 and was subsequently found in humans. It is produced by proteolytic cleavage of collagen XVIII, a member of the multiplexin family that is characterized by interruptions in the triple helix creating multiple domains, by proteases such as cathepsins. Collagen is a component of epithelial and endothelial basement membranes. Endostatin, as a fragment of collagen 18, demonstrates a role of the ECM in suppression of neoangiogenesis. Pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors can also be created by proteolysis during coagulation cascades. Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis are present in both normal tissue and cancerous tissue. Overall, endostatin down regulates many signaling cascades like ephrin, TNF-α, and NFκB signaling as well as coagulation and adhesion cascades. Other collagen derived antiangiogenic factors include arresten, canstatin, tumstatin, α 6 collagen type IV antiangiogenic fragment, and restin. Structure Human monomeric endostatin is a globular protein containing two disulfide bonds: Cys162−302 and Cys264−294. It folds tightly, has a zinc binding domain at the N-terminus of the protein, and has a high affinity for heparin through an 11 arginine basic patch. Endostatin also binds all heparan sulfate proteoglycans with low affinity. Oligomeric endostatin (trimer or dimer) binds mainly with laminin of the basal lamina. Biological Activity In-vitro studies have shown endostatin blocks the proliferation and organization of endothelial cells into new blood vessels. In animal studies endostatin inhibited angiogenesis and growth of both primary tumors and secondary metastasis. Mechanism Endostatin suppresses angiogenesis through many pathways affecting both cell viability and movement. Endostatin represses cell cycle control and anti-apoptosis genes in proliferating endothelial cells, resulting in cell death. Endostatin blocks pro-angiogenic gene expression controlled by c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) by interfering with TNFα activation of JNK. It reduces the growth of new cells by inhibiting cyclin D1. As a result, cells arrest during G1 phase and enter apoptosis. Alteration of FGF signal transduction by endostatin inhibits the migration of endothelial cells through disruption of cell-matrix adhesions, cell-cell adhesions, and cytoskeletal reorganization. By binding integrin α5β1 on endothelia cells it inhibits the signaling pathways of Ras and Raf kinases and decreases ERK-1 and p38 activity. Endostatin binding and clustering of integrins causes co-localization with caveolin-1 and activates non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and mobility. Other receptor interactions include the VEGF-R2/KDR/Flk-1 receptor on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endostatin may prevent activity from certain metalloproteinase. Several studies have focused on the downstream effects of endostatin reception. These studies have estimated that endostatin may significantly affect 12% of genes used by human endothelial cells. Although endostatin signaling may affect this vast number of genes, the downstream affects appear surprisingly limited. Endostatin reception seems to only affect angiogenesis that arrives from pathogenic sources, such as tumors. Processes associated with angiogenesis, such as wound healing and reproduction, are seemingly not affected by endostatin. The result is possible because pathogenic-derived angiogenesis usually involves signaling through integrins, which are directly affected by endostatin. Cancer Although this process by which endostatin works is not fully understood, it involves metalloproteases and endopeptidases that digest components of the extracellular matrix. Several similar endogeneous angiogenic factors are produced from matrix components in this fashion. For example, perlecan degradation can yield endorepellin which functions as an anti- angiogenic factor. Collectively, these products are thought to balance regulation between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors outside epithelial and endothelial layers. Among anti-angiogenesis inhibitors, endostatin has a wide range of anti-cancer spectrum targets, increasing its significance since synthetic inhibitors usually have single targets and struggle with toxicity. Endostatin has several characteristics that may be advantageous to cancer therapy. First of all, endogenous endostatin has been described as \\"the least toxic anti-cancer drug in mice\\". Furthermore, neither resistance nor toxicity to endostatin occur in humans. Also, endostatin has been estimated to affect 12% of the human genome. This reveals a broad spectrum of activity focused on preventing angiogenesis. This is very different from single-molecule therapies, and may change how cancer therapies are designed: drugs may be designed to target a wide range of genes instead of one particular protein. However, endostatin does not affect all tumors. For example, cancers that may have extreme pro-angiogenic activity through VEGF may overcome the anti-angiogenic effects of endostatin. Possible cancer treatment Endostatin is currently being studied as part of cancer research. Prior results indicated that endostatin can be beneficial in combinations with other medicines, but endostatin alone gave no significant improvements in tumor/disease progression. =Phase I= In a Phase I clinical trial of Endostatin, of the 19 patients treated, 12 were switched out of the trial by their physicians due to continued progression of their disease. Two patients continued to be treated, and the remaining patients withdrew on their own. The trial, designed primarily to demonstrate safety, indeed showed that the drug was safe and well tolerated (at the dosages used). =Phase II= In a Phase II clinical trial of Endostatin, 42 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors or carcinoid tumors were treated. Of the 40 patients which could be evaluated for a radiologic response, none experienced partial response to therapy, as defined by World Health Organization criteria. The conclusion from the trial was that, \\"Treatment with Endostatin did not result in significant tumor regression in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.\\" =Phase III= A phase III clinical trial was carried out on 493 histology or cytology- confirmed stage IIIB and IV NSCLC patients with a life expectancy >3 months. Patients were treated with Endostar (rh-endostatin, YH-16), a recombinant endostatin product, in combination with vinorelbine and cisplatin (a standard chemotherapeutic regimen). The addition of Endostar to the standard chemotherapeutic regimen in these advanced NSCLC patients resulted in significant and clinically meaningful improvement in response rate, median time to progression, and clinical benefit rate compared with the chemotherapeutic regimen alone.Results of phase III trial of rh-endostatin (YH-16) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (Y. Sun, J. Wang, Y. Liu, X. Song, Y. Zhang, K. Li, Y. Zhu, Q. Zhou, L. You and C. Yao) Clinical significance Endostatin may also be useful as a therapeutic for inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis as well as Crohn disease, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, and endometriosis by reducing the infiltration of inflammatory cells through invading angiogenesis. Down syndrome patients seem to be protected from diabetic retinopathy due to an additional copy of chromosome 21, and elevated expression of endostatin.

It is originally a Soviet-type honor, and is continued by several nations including Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. It was also awarded to cities and fortresses for collective efforts in heroic feats. Each hero receives a medal for public display, special privileges and rights for life, and the admiration and respect of the nation. Some countries without Soviet connections also award Hero honours.

Afterwards, each title could be awarded to a recipient only once in their lifetime.  Non-Soviet titles  Several nations with communist governments other than the Soviet Union, many part of the Warsaw Pact and the Eastern Bloc, adopted their own hero titles. These titles closely followed the Soviet model. Not all communist or socialist nations issued hero titles.

Each nation eventually began issuing their own titles, orders and decorations. Some republics, like the Baltic republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, did not create hero titles. Others, such as Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, continue with their own successor hero titles. The award criteria for these titles were kept largely intact. Ukraine was the only former Soviet republic to continue the two-hero award system from the time of its creation in 1998: the military \\"Order of the Gold Star\\" for heroism, and the civilian \\"Order of the State\\" for labour.

Parisi won tag team titles in several organizations, including the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). He held the WWWF World Tag Team Championship from 1975 to 1976. As a singles wrestler, he also won the WWF International Heavyweight Championship. After retiring from wrestling, Pugliese continued to work in the industry and also operated a hotel and restaurant. He died in 2000 after suffering a major aneurysm. Professional wrestling career Pugliese made his professional wrestling debut in Detroit, Michigan in 1961. He soon began competing in Canada, where he was a popular babyface (fan favorite) wrestler. In one of his first matches, he faced Gino Brito, who later became his long- time tag team partner. Pugliese and Brito moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1962 to wrestle in a promotion operated by Nick Gulas; they won the promotion's tag team title within two weeks of their arrival. Throughout his career, Pugliese formed many tag teams in various promotions with other wrestlers of Italian descent, including Dominic DeNucci, Tony Marino, and David Sammartino (who competed as Bruno Sammartino, Jr.). Although Pugliese often wrestled in Ontario throughout his career, he also competed as far away as Australia and Japan. In 1973, he participated in the first annual Champion Carnival tournament promoted by All Japan Pro Wrestling. He lost in the first round to Hiro Matsuda. Pugliese also wrestled as a heel (villain) at times. He competed as \\"Tenor\\" Parisi; in this gimmick, he wore a white tuxedo and sang opera to anger the crowd. =World Wide Wrestling Federation (1966 - 1967)= In 1966, Pugliese began wrestling for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), where he was billed as the cousin of Bruno Sammartino. In this role, he was targeted by several heel wrestlers, who wanted to start feuds with the Sammartino family. On February 21, 1966, Pugliese teamed with Johnny Valentine to win the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship from Dan Miller and Dr. Bill Miller. They held the title belts for nine months before dropping them to the team of Baron Mikel Scicluna and Smasher Sloan on September 22. In this match, Valentine turned on Pugliese by awarding the championship to their opponents when Pugliese was injured. Pugliese teamed with Miguel Pérez to challenge Scicluna and Sloan for the title on December 8, but Pérez sustained an injury during the match and was replaced by Spiros Arion. Pugliese and Arion won the match and the title; they held the belts for six months until June 1967. The team split up when Pugliese left the country briefly and Arnold Skaaland was named as co-holder of the championship in his place. =Traveling wrestler (1967 - 1975)= In December 1967, Pugliese teamed with Pedro Morales in the California-based World Wrestling Association (WWA). They won the WWA World Tag Team Championship by defeating Buddy Austin and Freddie Blassie. While defending the title, Pugliese also returned to the WWWF and began competing for the World Championship Wrestling in Australia. He teamed with Mario Milano to win the IWA World Tag Team Championship in April 1968. The team lost the belts to Skull Murphy and Killer Karl Kox in May, but Pugliese joined up with Dominic DeNucci to regain the title later that month. Although they dropped the title to Killer Kowalski and Bill Miller in June, Pugliese found a new partner in Don Leo Jonathan to regain the title on February 21, 1969. Two weeks later, The Spoiler and Pugliese's former partner Mario Milano (who had turned on Pugliese in the middle of a tag match with Spoiler and Kox to join their manager, Gary Hart\\"1969 Killer Karl Kox/The Spoiler v Mario Milano/Antonio Pugliese\\", from World Championship Wrestling, via YouTube) won the belts, but Pugliese and Jonathan regained them in a rematch later that month. Returning to the United States, Pugliese formed another tag team in Big Time Wrestling, a Texas-based division of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He teamed with Wahoo McDaniel to win the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship. Records from the time period in this promotion are unclear about the dates and title lineage, but there is a record of Pugliese and McDaniel holding the belts in 1969. The following year, Pugliese held the IWA World Tag Team Championship for the final time, as he teamed with Mark Lewin to win the belts from Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson on May 15, 1970. They defended the title for just over a month before losing it to Kurt and Karl Von Steiger. Pugliese then joined the Buffalo, New York-based National Wrestling Federation (NWF). Once again, he found success teaming with Dominic DeNucci. The pair competed in a tournament for the vacant NWF World Tag Team Championship in January 1972; they made it to the final round but lost to the team of Mitsu Arakawa and Yoshino Sato. Pugliese and DeNucci continued to challenge for the title, and they defeated Arakawa and Sato in March to win the belts. They dropped the belts to Don and Johnny Fargo in May but regained them in a rematch the same month. Later that month, however, the Fargos regained the belts. Pugliese and DeNucci were unable to regain them, but Pugliese teamed up with Luis Martinez to win the title in December. Records are unclear as to whom they won the belts from and how they lost them. Pugliese and DeNucci next traveled to Florida, where they competed for Championship Wrestling from Florida, an NWA territory. They defeated Toru Tanaka and Dick Slater to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in January 1975. Slater teamed with Johnny Weaver to win the belts back from Pugliese and DeNucci, however. =Return to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (1975 - 1982)= Pugliese's next major success came in the WWWF, where he had been wrestling sporadically since 1970 under the ring name Tony Parisi. He teamed with Gino Brito, who was wrestling as Louis Cerdan, to win the WWWF World Tag Team Championship on November 18, 1975. They defeated The Blackjacks (Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Lanza) to win the belts and held them for over six months. They eventually dropped the title in a match against The Executioners (a team composed of Killer Kowalski and Big John Studd, who wore masks to hide their identities) on May 11, 1976. Also in 1976, Parisi teamed with champion Bruno Sammartino in Madison Square Garden to defeat Ivan Koloff and Superstar Billy Graham.When the promotion (which had since been renamed the World Wrestling Federation) decided to reactivate the WWF International Heavyweight Championship in 1982, Parisi became the new champion. He lost the belt to his former partner, Gino Brito, that August. =Montreal's Lutte Internationale (1982 - 1984)= Much of Pugliese's later career was spent wrestling as Tony Parisi in the Montreal-based Lutte Internationale (also known as International Wrestling). He traveled throughout the province, competing primarily as a tag team wrestler. In 1982, he teamed with Gino Brito to win the Canadian International Tag Team Championship from Gilles Poisson and Sailor White. Although they dropped the title to Pierre Lefebvre and Michel Dubois, they were able to regain the belts the following January from Lefebvre and Pat Patterson. Lefebvre teamed with Billy Robinson to win the title back, but Parisi and Brito won the title for the third time on December 12, 1983 from then-champions Lefebvre and Patterson. Once again, Lefebvre took on a new partner, this time Frenchy Martin, to win the belts from Parisi and Brito the following month. Parisi's final reign with the title began on February 20, 1984, when he joined up with Dino Bravo to regain the belts. Their title reign lasted for several months before Lefebvre and Martin defeated Parisi and Bravo to win back the championship. =Legacy= Pugliese promoted wrestling shows in Niagara Falls after retiring from the sport. He also ran an annual wrestling show at the CHIN Picnic in Toronto. In 1997, Pugliese returned to the ring to compete at the second Ilio DiPaolo tribute show promoted by World Championship Wrestling show. He reunited with partner Gino Brito in a tag team match, and the pair defeated Greg Valentine and Terry Funk by disqualification. Pugliese is credited as the inspiration behind George \\"The Animal\\" Steele's gimmick of eating turnbuckle padding in the ring. A wrestler, who Steele believes was Pugliese, jokingly suggested the idea to Steele, who became well known for his fondness for turnbuckles. Existing autographs signed by Pugliese using his real name are thought to be rare. Personal life Born in Italy, Pugliese moved to Thunder Bay, Ontario when he was nine years old, but soon moved to Niagara Falls, Ontario. He joined the YMCA in Niagara Falls and began amateur wrestling at the age of 16. He enjoyed listening to opera music and once referred to his LP albums as his \\"prize possessions\\". Pugliese met Chiara Vaccaro in Niagara Falls, and the couple married in 1968. They had a daughter named Ida in 1976. He operated the Niagara Family Inn and Big Anthony's Restaurant in Niagara Falls with his family until he died from a major aneurysm on August 19, 2000. He was related to Joseph Dorgan, who has wrestled under his relative's name as Johnny Parisi and is better known as Johnny Swinger.

Portrayed by Michael Le Vell, the character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 19 October 1983. Le Vell was suspended from the soap in February 2013 due to allegations of sexual offences, with scenes he had already filmed cut from broadcast.'Coronation Street': Michael Le Vell scenes dropped after charges Le Vell was found not guilty of all charges in September 2013, and briefly returned in early 2014, before taking another 3-month break from the show and returning once again. Kevin is protective of his two daughters Rosie Webster (Emma Collinge, Helen Flanagan) and Sophie Webster (Ashleigh Middleton, Emma Woodward, Brooke Vincent) and their mother Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor). His notable storylines have seen him have an on-and-off relationship and marriage with Sally, his affairs with Natalie Horrocks (Denise Welch) and Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), the latter of which resulted in the birth of his illegitimate son Jack (Kyran Bowes) and subsequent second divorce from Sally. Kevin has since embarked on a romance with Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews). This relationship ended in 2015 after she kidnapped Jack. More recently, his storylines have focused on him caring for Jack after he was diagnosed with sepsis, requiring foot amputation and helping him with treatment. Storylines Kevin arrives in Weatherfield in 1983, moving in with Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) as her lodger. He gets a job as a mechanic at Brian Tilsley's (Christopher Quinten) garage. His father, Bill (Peter Armitage), and sister, Debbie (Sue Devaney), soon follow. Kevin stays in Weatherfield after Bill remarries and he and Debbie move down to Southampton in January 1985. Kevin builds up a mother-son relationship with Hilda. Kevin becomes good friends with Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), who sets him up on a blind date with Michelle Robinson (Stephanie Tague) in May 1985. The two start dating and Kevin loses his virginity to her but after pressuring her constantly for sex, Michelle ends the relationship in July. Kevin is single until January 1986 when he meets Sally Seddon (Sally Dynevor) after accidentally splashing her whilst driving by in his work van. Their romance is often strained, due to Hilda's interference, as she feels that Kevin is too good for Sally and Sally is loyal to her family, who treat her badly. Kevin proposes repeatedly but Sally only accepts after Kevin risks his life saving Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) from a fire in 1986. They finally marry in October 1986. The following year, Hilda leaves Weatherfield after selling the house to Kevin and Sally and Kevin continues to work at the garage after Brian is murdered. After a lot of persuasion from Sally, he buys it in 1996 and goes into partnership with Tony Horrocks (Lee Warburton). Kevin and Sally have two daughters: Rosie (Helen Flanagan) and Sophie (Brooke Vincent). However, their happiness doesn't last as Kevin has an affair with Natalie Horrocks (Denise Welch), mother of Tony. Originally, their affair is no strings attached but Natalie falls for Kevin and wants him permanently. As a result, she gets careless so Sally discovers Kevin's infidelity but forgives him; however, they separate after Sally has an affair with Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington). They divorce in 1999 and Kevin refuses to allow Sally to take the girls back to live with her. She gave him residency while she found somewhere for her and the girls to live. Kevin learns that Greg was violent towards Sally in front of Rosie and Sophie but she is still awarded custody. Later that year, Kevin starts dating factory worker Alison Wakefield (Naomi Radcliffe), but she leaves him when it becomes clear that he is still in love with Sally. However, upon discovering that she is pregnant, they reconcile and marry in January 2000 with Kevin's daughters, Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), Linda Sykes (Jacqueline Pirie) and Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) present. Their happiness doesn't last, however, when their newborn son Jake dies from a Group B streptococcal infection. The tragedy distresses Alison so much that she snatches Sarah-Louise Platt's (Tina O'Brien) newborn daughter, Bethany (Emily & Amy Walton), and commits suicide after giving baby Bethany to Kevin, leaving him devastated. In the following months, Kevin dates Molly Hardcastle (Jacqueline Kingston), a nurse he meets through his friend, Martin Platt (Sean Wilson), whom he helps reconsider committing suicide when he learns that she is financial trouble. He ends the relationship when he realises that he is still in love with Sally and disrupts her wedding to Danny Hargreaves, telling him that he and Sally had a one night stand the night before he married Alison. Danny is disgusted and jilts Sally at the altar, leaving her devastated. As 2002 approaches, Kevin is determined to win Sally back and eventually convinces her to marry him again, although she warns him that it is only for their daughters' sakes. However, while engaged to Kevin, Sally has a brief fling with Alex, a painter, and decorator, which is revealed on their wedding day. Sally has to decide who she wants to be with and chooses Kevin, who has already forgiven her for her fling with Alex, and they remarry on 9 December 2002. During the following years, Kevin continues to work at the garage and becomes a brotherly figure to employee Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall). He also becomes good friends with his employee Tommy Harris (Thomas Craig), and they save Gail Hillman (Helen Worth) and her children, Sarah and David (Jack P. Shepherd) when her husband Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) tries to kill them in the Weatherfield canal in March 2003. Kevin is distraught when he discovers Tommy's body in the garage in March 2005 after he has been murdered by his daughter, Katy (Lucy-Jo Hudson). That same year sees Sally become a pushy parent, much to Kevin and Rosie's distress. She enrols Rosie into the prestigious Oakhill School after Rosie shows good potential at maths and forces Kevin to work longer hours so they can keep her there. Sally also starts working for car dealer Ian Davenport (Philip Bretherton), whose daughter, Gemma, is one of Rosie's friends at Oakhill. Sally and Ian have an affair later in 2005, which Rosie discovers when she walks in on them. When Kevin finds out, he is devastated and decides to end the marriage but Rosie persuades him not to, convincing him that Sally does love him and is only having the affair so that she can pay her tuition fees. In 2007, Kevin is worried that Sally is having another affair, this time with teacher John Stape (Graeme Hawley). This transpires as John is tutoring Sally in A-level English. John's girlfriend Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) thinks the same but when she confronts Sally on Christmas Day 2007, Kevin, Sally and Fiz are stunned to learn that John is, in fact, having an affair with Rosie. Kevin severely beats John in the street and is subsequently arrested for assault, being sentenced to 28 days imprisonment. However, he only serves 14 days for good behaviour. Kevin begins feuding with businessman Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) during July 2008, who manipulates Rosie into helping him persuade Kevin to sell him the garage. Kevin refuses but Tony invests in Kevin again, this time with Jimmy Dockerson (Robert Beck), Kevin responds angrily but forgets about Jimmy until he realises he is losing clients. He confronts the specific garage mechanic alone with Jimmy before confronting Tony about the situation, although Sally and Rosie deny Kevin's proof. Kevin later discovers that his tow truck has been stolen whilst helping a woman fix her car on a call-out. Although he has no proof, he knows that Tony is responsible and finds out that Rosie is giving Tony business documents from the garage. He is furious that she has betrayed him like that, even though she thought she was actually helping him with his ailing business. He gives half the business to Tyrone as an incentive to help him rebuild the business. As a result of his ploy to stop Tony from gaining control of it, Kevin is now a co-owner. Rosie later disappears, leaving Sally and Kevin distraught. They initially think that she has run off with lottery winnings from the Underworld syndicate until Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) admits that she stole Rosie's identity and used it to claim the money. Sally and Kevin receive a postcard from Rosie, which leads them to believe that she is in Holyhead and Sally goes there, searching for her to no avail. Kevin and Sally are reunited with Rosie on 5 November 2008, when Fiz discovers that John Stape had abducted her. Kevin threatens John but is restrained by a detective. In 2009, Kevin becomes attracted to Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), wife of his business partner and best friend, Tyrone. Molly begins to help Sally with the book-keeping and spends more time with Kevin. Eventually, he tells Molly that he has feelings for her but she is initially horrified and slaps Kevin but later admits that she is flattered. They begin an affair, first sleeping together when Kevin sneaks away from Sally's birthday party in July 2009. Afterwards, Kevin feels guilty and decides to end the fling by persuading Tyrone to take Molly on holiday but it resumes in August. They soon admit that they love each other and plan to start a new life together. However, Kevin keeps finding reasons not to tell Sally, including Sophie's baptism and her GCSEs. On Christmas Day, Kevin and Molly agree that they will tell their respective partners then but Sally drops a bombshell of her own - she has breast cancer. Kevin makes it to Molly's house before she tells Tyrone, telling her that Sally has cancer and that he intends to support her, ending their relationship. However, he has to talk to Molly as she discovers that she is four months pregnant and isn't sure who the father is. Kevin, however, refuses to have anything to do with her and suggests she have a termination but Tyrone is thrilled and convinces Molly to let him look after her. Hurt by Kevin's behaviour, Molly agrees. In August 2010 at Roy and Hayley's wedding, Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) tells the Street that she caught Sophie and her best friend, Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson), kissing a few days before but Kevin and Sally don't believe her. Sophie admits the truth to her shocked father that night, that she and Sian are in love. Kevin is supportive but the girls decide to run away together, much to Kevin and Sally's devastation. They are later reunited with her after Rosie tracks her down to Sheffield and brings them home. On 6 December, Kevin is knocked down by the explosion in the Joinery and derails a tram that smashes into the corner shop, crushing Molly, who is inside with baby Jack and Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati). He and Tyrone try to free Molly but they are pulled away by the emergency services. Sally sits with Molly to comfort her as she is dying and she tells Sally that Kevin is baby Jack's father. Sally is devastated and Kevin admits it so she throws him out and he returns to the hospital to see how Jack is doing. When Jack is discharged, Tyrone asks for Kevin and Sally for help to look after him. However, Sally goes out, unable to face Jack but Kevin finds her and tries to convince her that he still loves her. Sally tells him that she wants him to leave for good. Later, in the Rovers, he meets Bill and Pam. Pam expresses her grief at Molly's death and makes it clear she blames Kevin as she does not know how to tell Molly's father, Diggory Compton (Eric Potts). The funeral is arranged for 17 December 2010 and during the service, Tyrone breaks down while giving his eulogy and Kevin takes over but Sally leaves the church, disgusted. Unfortunately, this and seeing Kevin and Sally argue arouses Tyrone's suspicions. At the graveside, Tyrone realises that Kevin is Jack's father and attacks him at the graveside, making him fall into the grave on top of Molly's coffin. Later, Sally, Rosie, and Sophie insist that Kevin leave, despite his pleas for forgiveness. Kevin spends the night in the garage and goes home the next day, barging in and refuses to leave until Sally threatens to call the police and have him arrested. Sophie begs her not to and Sally agrees to let Kevin stay that night, providing that he stay away from her. The next day, Tyrone gives baby Jack to Kevin, much to Sally and Rosie's disgust and Rosie moves out. On Christmas Eve, Sally tells Kevin that watching him with Jack makes her hate him even more and she wants them out. He asks Tyrone to take Jack back but he refuses so Kevin moves out, but after a desperate plea from Sophie, Sally allows Kevin to stay for Christmas Day. On New Year's Eve, Kevin accepts the fact that Jack is his son and that his family doesn't want him around. He leaves Coronation Street, returning a week later only to find Tyrone leaving his house and confronts him. Sally tells Kevin that her life is no longer his business, making Kevin and Tyrone fight. Kevin tells Sally that he is filing for divorce and is putting the house on the market. Kevin and Sally agree a truce but when Kevin suggests they reconcile and raise Jack together, Sally refuses and this leads to a feud between them as he shows buyers around the house but Sally and neighbour, Eddie Windass (Steve Huison) put them off. That week, Rosie tells Kevin that she wants to get to know Jack better and offers to babysit but actually uses him for a modelling audition but brings the wrong baby home, angering Kevin. He returns the other child and collects Jack from the studio, telling Rosie to stay away and ignores her until her boss, Alfie, Sally's new boyfriend, Jeff Cullen (Steven Houghton), fires her. Kevin supports her and offers to punch Alfie but the arguing upsets Sophie so she gets drunk and believing that her life is falling apart, falls off the church roof. Sally blames Kevin and they argue again until Sian interrupts, telling them that they are both responsible for Sophie's accident. Although unhappy at what Sian has said, they accept this and call a truce. Sally invites him to the house for the evening and allows Kevin to hug her but he gets the wrong impression and tries to kiss her so she asks him to leave. On the day that Kevin and Sally meet to finalise their divorce, Kevin wins £200,000 on a scratch card but keeps it secret. Tyrone, however, tells Sally just as she is about to sign. On hearing this, Sally refuses to sign and demands £100,000. The following week, Sally receives some flowers from Kevin and he also buys Sally a new car but she sells it and keeps the money before getting the lottery money frozen until a court hearing can be arranged. However, the judge rules in Kevin's favour as Sally loses her temper when Kevin's lawyer reminds her of her affair with Ian Davenport but he later gives the entire £200,000 to Sally, after Bill encourages him to do whatever is necessary to win Sally back. After talking to Gail, she returns half of the winnings to him for Jack and they call a truce. When Jeff reveals he is taking Sally to Paris for a fortnight and gloats in front of Kevin, Sally apologises for Jeff's attitude and they remember their wedding anniversary trip to Paris five years before. Kevin bids Sally farewell and they part on good terms. In May 2011, Kevin and Tyrone's feuding at the garage turns violent after Tyrone, in a fit of rage, damages a new hydraulic lift that Kevin has bought. Kevin is crushed under a car he is working on when it gives way and is saved by Tyrone and Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain). When Tyrone admits he damaged the lift, Kevin forgives him and they call a truce so they can work together. Sally returns from Paris that day and aks Kevin and Jack to stay with her until his injuries heal and he agrees. One day in June, he isn't happy to see Sophie and Sian giving money to Ken Barlow's (William Roache) grandson, James Cunningham (James Roache), when the soup kitchen is reportedly burgled. He bans them from the kitchen and is surprised when Sally backs him up but Sophie ignores them and starts working there as a manager. Kevin softens and supports the charity auction held at the bistro. The following day, Kevin gets the all-clear about his collarbone and is shocked when Sophie asks him to loan her £20,000 so the charity can buy the house they've been renting. After Kevin refuses, Sophie hacks into his bank account and transfers £20,000 to the charity. Meanwhile, Sally and Kevin's relationship is improving as Sally doesn't ask Kevin to return to his flat and they have stopped arguing. However, the next day, Sophie and Sian are horrified to learn that the charity never bid for the house and that the soup kitchen is being demolished, with builders insisting it hasn't been occupied for months. Failing to find the charity leaders, Rob and Janet, Sophie and Sian realise that they've lost £20,000. Forced to confess, she tells Kevin, who angrily confronts James, who insists he knows nothing about the scam and is supported by the Barlow family, except Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who has suspicions. Kevin calls the police but tells them that he transferred the cash, ending the tension in the Webster home. A few days later, Kevin learns that the two con artists behind the charity scam have been arrested and tells Sally. James panics, realising that the truth will come out; he attacks Ken and flees Weatherfield. Ken tells the Websters what has happened and Kevin tells the police. In September, Kevin learns that Tyrone has a new girlfriend, Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede), a police officer he met in a bar. Tommy admits to Kevin he paid Kirsty to flirt with Tyrone and Kevin insists Tommy tell Tyrone the truth. During September, Kevin learns that his sister Debbie has bought a villa in Turkey and plans to take Jack there. However, he learns that to change Jack's birth certificate, he'll have to apply for parental responsibility. Ken, who has experience of adoption, warns him that he should discuss it with Tyrone. Tyrone angrily tells Kevin to do whatever he wants. The next day, Bill and Pam visit Kevin and tell him that they are engaged but Pam is appalled to learn that Kevin is still living with Sally and plans to change Jack's surname. This prompts Sally, to ask Kevin to leave and he reluctantly agrees. Kevin and Pam argue and she bans him from the wedding whilst he bans her from seeing Jack. Bill collapses, suffering a heart attack, and is taken to hospital, but the arguing continues until Sally stops them. Sally ends the relationship the next day after she hears Kevin telling Sophie that they are back together. Wanting to prove Kevin wrong, she resumes her relationship with Jeff, much to Rosie and Sophie's disgust. Over the coming weeks, Kevin accepts Sally has moved on and decides to stop trying to win her back and in October, they are back on good terms as proved when Sophie announces she and Sian are engaged. Kevin refuses to give his permission for their marriage and Sally agrees, but next day, Kevin and Rosie's boyfriend Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) are concerned when Rosie goes missing again after viewing a flat and learn that it is next to The Kabin. They kick the door down and find Rosie tied up, John having kidnapped her again because he is coaching her to be a witness for Fiz at her trial. John escapes but Kevin goes after him, leaving Jason to look after Rosie. As he tells a horrified Sally, John races past them in his car and Kevin chases him, resulting in a car chase that ends when John crashes his car into a truck trailer. The next day, as Rosie gives her statement, she thanks her dad for rescuing her and Kevin is the hero of the Webster family. When John dies, Kevin has to stop Sally from going to see Fiz being sentenced, because she belittles Fiz's friends and family for supporting a murderer. He defends her in The Rovers when Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) attacks Sally for her comments. Later in the week, Sophie celebrates her 17th birthday. However, this is overshadowed when Kevin reads an article in the Gazette about Rosie's second kidnapping, as well as insensitive comments about Sally's cancer, Kevin's affair, baby Jack and about Sophie's sexuality. Kevin and Sally are furious with Rosie, and they throw Jeff out when they learn he convinced Rosie to write the article. Sophie's birthday is celebrated by Kevin with a firework display. In personal terms, Kev and Sal are on good terms again. Towards the end of 2011, Sophie and Sian announce their intention to have a civil partnership. Kevin and Sally come round to the idea and a date is set for late December. However, Kevin learns from Sunita that Sophie has been having doubts, and he tries unsuccessfully to talk her out of it. Later, during the ceremony, Kevin feels his fears are well-founded when Sophie stumbles through her vows and tells her that she didn't have to go through with it, causing a massive row between Sophie and Sian; the ceremony is abandoned. That evening Sian leaves Sophie for good and Kevin is guilt- stricken over his part in the break-up. Sophie tells him that she will never speak to him again. Sally and Rosie are sympathetic, knowing Kevin didn't do it out of spite. Soon Kevin learns that Sally is dating Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), who is awaiting trial for raping Carla Connor (Alison King). Kevin had doubts about Frank's past and wanting the truth from Sally, he is forced to tell Sophie but Sally accuses Kevin of trying to interfere in their relationship and retaliates by telling him that she will file for divorce the next day. Sophie rejects him again when she asks Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) to fix a leak in the kitchen - stating that she would \\"much rather drown than speak to my dad again\\", though Rita suggests Kevin give it time and Sophie will realise that she was wrong but she adopts Frank as father figure, to Kevin's growing disgust. However, he did achieve one good thing: he started repairing his friendship with Tyrone as Kirsty had just learned that she was pregnant and Tyrone wasn't sure if he wanted to be with her. Upon learning on Kirsty's pregnancy, Kevin congratulated Tyrone and the two shook hands. This persuaded Tyrone to stay with her and started Kevin and Tyrone's healing relationship. After Frank was cleared of raping Carla, he made plans for Underworld's future and cheated on Sally with business associate, Jenny Sumner (Niky Wardley). When Sally confronted him, Frank admitted raping Carla and threatened Sally. This infuriated Kevin, who vowed to kill Frank. When Sally finds Frank dead and becomes a suspect, Frank's mother, Anne (Gwen Taylor), is revealed to be responsible. Horrified, Sally tries to escape but trips, hits her head and is knocked unconscious. She is rushed to hospital following a tense standoff between Anne, Kevin, and Carla. At the hospital, whilst waiting for Sally to emerge from her coma, Sophie thanks Kevin for stopping the civil partnership. A few days later, Sally returns from hospital and admits she is grateful to Kevin. In February 2013, Kevin helps Tyrone escape with his daughter behind Kirsty Soames' back. Kevin is later questioned by the police. In late March, Sally tells the neighbours that Kevin has had to leave because his father is ill and Pam cannot cope on her own. On Monday 17 March, Sally announces that Bill has recovered and that Kevin will be returning later in the week, with his son Jack. The following day, he phones his house tenants Stella Price (Michelle Collins), Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Eva moves out to live with her boyfriend Jason, leaving a spare bedroom for Kevin and Jack. Kevin arrives in a taxi, while Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) invites him into The Kabin for a cup of tea and a chat. When Kevin and Jack are inside Rita's flat, Sophie's friend Maddie Heath (Amy James-Kelly) steals one of their bags with their iPod, camera and Jack's clothes inside. Kevin later spots a man in Sally's house, who turns out to be her boyfriend Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine). Mistaking Tim for a burglar, Kevin attacks him, but Sally turns up and reveals who he is. Kevin later goes to visit Tyrone who invites him and Jack to stay at his house until Stella and Leanne find somewhere else. Kevin then returns to work full-time at the garage. In 2015, Kevin embarks on a romantic relationship with an old friend Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews). They go on a few dates and Kevin invites her back to his for a nightcap but Jenny is reluctant to return to Coronation Street for fear of seeing her former foster mother, Rita. Jenny eventually returns to the Street. Rita struggles to forgive Jenny but they begin to get along. Eventually, Jenny moves into Kevin's house and the pair engage in a serious relationship. Kevin's daughter, Sophie, disapproves of the relationship and suspects Jenny of plotting something. Jenny starts to bond with Kevin's son Jack. In May 2015, it is discovered that Jenny previously had a son, who died when he drowned in a paddling pool; Jenny blames herself for the accident. Jenny plans to leave Kevin, taking Jack with her. She calls for a taxi and puts on a wig, using the name of \\"Melanie Davies\\", arranging to rent a flat in Hull. Jenny is discovered by Sophie's girlfriend, Maddie, but leaves for Hull with Jack. When Kevin and Sophie realise that Jack is missing, they travel to Hull, with Rita, to find Jenny is on the balcony with Jack. Rita talks Jenny down and she is taken away by the police and sectioned. In August 2015, Kevin decides to expand his garage business. Kevin's ex-wife, Sally is impressed with his entrepreneurial spirit and encourages him. When the factory where Sally works comes up for sale, she persuades Kevin to help her buy it. Kevin and Sally later kiss, but Sally is engaged to Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine), and they agree to keep it between them. Kevin and Sally's daughter, Sophie, senses an atmosphere, and Sally eventually confesses that she kissed Kevin but says it was a mistake. Sally's next-door neighbour, Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) overhears Sally and Sophie discussing the matter. A few weeks later, when Anna is drunk at The Rovers Return Inn, she tells Tim that Kevin and Sally recently kissed. As a result, Sally and Tim split up, putting Kevin and Tim's friendship in jeopardy. Kevin and Tim are reconciled but Tim at first refuses to forgive Sally; they eventually marry. A few months later, Kevin is devastated to learn that his best mate Tyrone's step-daughter has cancer. He tries his best to support Tyrone and says he can take as much time off as he needs. Kevin also decides to give his daughter Sophie 21% of his new business for her 21st birthday. Kevin meets a woman called Joanne (Martha Cope) on a singles night and they start dating. However, Kevin has doubts about her and it soon becomes clear that he has feelings for Anna and the pair kiss. Anna then helps Kevin separate from Joanne by pretending to get pregnant by him. Kevin and Anna start dating but agree to wait before going public. Tim sees them together in the back of a taxi, and Sally and Sophie soon find out. Kevin gets a job with Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre), but Anna is unhappy as Phelan had previously blackmailed her into sleeping with him. Anna warns Kevin, but Phelan lies to him. Anna refuses to let Phelan affect their relationship. After she smashes Phelan's van Kevin breaks up with her but catches Phelan threatening her. She tells him about how Phelan blackmailed her. Anna and Kevin go out for tea and meet Phelan and his new girlfriend Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). Kevin tricks Phelan by ordering a bottle of wine. On 16 May 2016, Tim goes to Blackpool with Kevin and Jack. Sally and Sophie follow and see Tim and Kevin through a café window. Sally confronts them while Jack disappears. Jenny, who is also in Blackpool, sees Jack and runs after him. Kevin sees Jack run out in front of a tram, but Jenny pushes him out of the way just in time. Although Sally and Sophie make accusations, Kevin thanks Jenny for saving Jack's life. In October 2016, Kevin and Anna decide to move in together. However, after helping in freeing Gary and Lily Platt from under David's crashed car, Anna is engulfed in flames when a fireball from the car strikes her. Kevin and Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) are able to extinguish the flames before Anna is taken to hospital. Later, when Anna is made homeless, she moves in with Kevin. In early June 2018, Anna leaves Weatherfield after she stabbed enemy Pat Phelan in the viaduct bistro, leaving him to die. This leaves Kevin heart-broken but he soon gets over it. Later that month, Rosie leaves claiming she needs to find herself. In the following month, when Sophie is looking after Jack, he falls over and hurts his knee. Sophie takes him home but thinks nothing of it. Then, he starts to claim it is in pain and they soon come to discover that his leg needs to be amputated. Kevin is shocked by this news and struggles to come to terms with the fact that his son will now only have one leg. As Sophie feels guilty for not realising that Jack wasn’t well, she tries to help by finding a way to get Jack his treatment in Liverpool, Kevin finds it all too sudden and rejects her attempts. Over the next couple of months, Kevin starts to struggle as he has to support Jack. Creation=Casting= Actor Michael Le Vell auditioned for the role and landed the part after he had played another character called Neil Grimshaw, a newspaper delivery boy who worked at The Kabin. Kevin Webster as he appeared in 1983. =Characterisation= Kevin is very much a family man and looks out for them. ITV publicity say of the character: \\"A no-nonsense garage mechanic who likes an uncomplicated life and his tea on the table when he comes home from work.\\". In the book 'Life in The Street' by Graeme Kay, Kevin is described as a very cheerful yet cautious character. Development=Background= Kevin is the son of Bill (Peter Armitage) and Alison Webster. Kevin's mother died of cancer when he was just 15 years old and this experience traumatised him. He first appears in 1983, as an apprentice mechanic working for Brian Tilsley (Chris Quinten). His father Bill and his younger sister, Debbie (Sue Devaney), later join him. Initially his life consists of working by day and drinking with friends Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro) and Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) in the evening. He dates Mandie Whitworth, a friend of Terry's girlfriend and Michelle Robinson and meets his long term love interest, Sally Seddon (Sally Dynevor), in 1986 and they later marry. The Websters buy Number 13 from Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) after she leaves to work as a doctor's housekeeper. =Relationship with Sally Seddon= The characters of Kevin and Sally had a lack of storylines in their first years on the show but received a boost when Brian Park became executive producer. The Independent reports him as saying \\"Kevin and Sally Webster had years of washing their hands and eating baked beans on toast. Michael Le Vell and Sally Dynevor (then Whittaker) were then given great storylines, including his affair with Natalie, Sally's catfight with her when she found out and the subsequent divorce\\". Kevin spends his early years in the show with Sally Seddon. They marry and have two daughters, Rosie (Helen Flanagan) and Sophie (Brooke Vincent). While Sally is away nursing her sick mother, Kevin has an affair with Natalie Horrocks (Denise Welch) mother of his business partner. Natalie has no compunction about seducing a married man. Sally angrily confronts Natalie when she learns of the affair. Kevin and Sally divorce, due to the affair, and Kevin moves in with Natalie. However, he is unhappy and ends the relationship to return to Sally. Sally and Kevin reconcile, partly for the girls' sake. However, Sally is seduced by Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington). Kevin throws her out when he learns of the affair. Greg uses Sally's money (inherited from her mother) and abuses her. The affair ends but Kevin refuses to take her back, marrying Alison Wakefield (Naomi Radcliffe) instead. The night before the wedding, Kevin and Sally sleep together for old times' sake. This secret assignation comes out, on the day Sally is to marry Danny Hargreaves (Richard Standing). Danny calls their wedding off, angry that she had cheated on him and then lied about it. Kevin's marriage to Alison is fraught. It is learned she had a traumatic childhood after her sibling drowned and Alison is suspected of intentionally killing her. When Alison is late returning Rosie and Sophie after an outing, Sally and Kevin, perhaps believing Alison really did murder her sibling, fear that Alison might have harmed them. Alison and the girls soon return - Alison had actually taken the girls to a photographer for portraits as a gift to Kevin. Alison is traumatised when she learns Kevin and Sally feared she might have harmed the girls. Alison later commits suicide after the death of her newborn son. Kevin asks Sally to marry him again and she agrees, for the sake of their daughters. Sally has another affair with new boss, Ian Davenport (Philip Bretherton), in 2005. Kevin overlooks it, pretending to believe Sally's denial. In 2009, Kevin develops an attraction to Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), wife of his business partner and friend Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and has an affair with her lasting until Christmas 2009. =Temporary departures= In February 2013, Michael Le Vell was accused of sexual assault allegations and Kevin was written out of the series with the explanation that he was in Germany taking care of his father Bill Webster to explain his absence. Le Vell was found not guilty in September of the same year, and entered talks to return. Kevin returned briefly in March 2014, 13 months since his last appearance, before taking another temporary break from the show after it was revealed that Le Vell had taken cocaine during his absence. Reception Le Vell was nominated in the category of \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

Located in the main valley of the Valley of the Kings, the tomb was originally started by Setnakhte, but abandoned when it broke into the earlier tomb of Amenmesse (KV10). Setnakhte was buried in KV14. The tomb KV11 was restarted and extended and on a different axis for Ramesses III. The tomb has been open since antiquity, and has been known variously as \\"Bruce's Tomb\\" (named after James Bruce who entered the tomb in 1768) and the \\"Harper's Tomb\\" (due to paintings of two blind harpers in the tomb). Decoration KV11 Setnakhte-Rameses III Schematic The long tomb is beautifully decorated. The second corridor is decorated with the Litany of Re. At the end of this corridor the axis of the tomb shifts. This third corridor is decorated with the Book of Gates and the Book of Amduat, and leads over a ritual shaft, and then into a four-pillared hall. This hall is again decorated with the Book of Gates. A fourth corridor decorated with scenes of the opening of the mouth ceremony leads into a vestibule, with scenes of the Book of the Dead, and then into the burial chamber proper. The burial chamber is an eight-pillared hall in which stood the red quartzite sarcophagus (which is now in the Louvre, while its lid is in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge). This chamber is decorated with Book of Gates, divine scenes and the Book of the Earth. Beyond this is a further set of annexes, decorated with the Book of Gates. The outside of the sarcophagus features two scenes from the Amduat.https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre- notices/sarcophagus-box-ramesses-iii  Study and documentation of the tomb  The tomb was first mentioned by an English traveler Richard Pococke in the 1730s, but its first detailed description was given by James Bruce in 1768. Preliminary scientific studies were made by French scholars, who had come to Egypt with Napoleon, and then by, among others, J. F. Champollion, R. Lepsius, and in the 19th century, G. Lefebure.Zsold Kiss (ed.), 50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie, Warsaw: PCMA, 1986 In 1959, the Egyptian Department of Antiquities asked a Polish Egyptologist, Dr. Tadeusz Andrzejewski, to document the tomb. He started work under the auspices of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw but soon died. Twenty years later, the task of completing the documentation was given to Dr. Marek Marciniak. The introduction of martial law in Poland hindered the publication of the results of his study. Since 2017, a German expedition from the Humboldt University and the Egyptian universities in Luxor and Qena works on the site. Apart from documenting the tomb, it also carries out conservation works. References * Reeves, N & Wilkinson, R.H. The Complete Valley of the Kings, 1996, Thames and Hudson, London. *Siliotti, A.

Galehead Mountain, a lower spur of South Twin, is to the west. The east face of South Twin drains into the Little River, thence into the Ammonoosuc and Connecticut Rivers, and into Long Island Sound in Connecticut. The northwest slopes of South Twin drain to the North Branch of the Gale River, another tributary of the Ammonoosuc River. Southwest of South Twin Mountain is the valley of Twin Brook, which flows into the Franconia Branch of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River, through the Pemigewasset Wilderness, thence into the Pemigewasset and Merrimack Rivers, and into the Gulf of Maine in Massachusetts. The summit of South Twin is open and rocky, but stands of spruce and fir trees grow in close proximity.

The character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 27 January 1986, when Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) drove past her in his van and accidentally splashed her while she was waiting for a bus. As of 2020, Sally has been on the show for nearly 35 years, making her the ninth longest-running character on the show. She is protective of her two daughters Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) and Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Her notable storylines have seen her have an on-and-off relationship and marriage with Kevin, becoming the victim of domestic violence by Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington), being diagnosed with breast cancer as well as her attempts to become the pillar of the community and annoy Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) in the process. Over the years, she has tried to impress her bosses Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley), Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) and Carla Connor (Alison King) and gain promotions. Sally also embarks on a relationship with Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) and goes on to marry him, survives a minibus crash, begins a political career on the local council and later progresses to become the Mayor, becomes the victim of an internet troll, is wrongfully imprisoned for fraud and is injured when the roof collapses at the factory. Storylines Out in the van, Kevin goes through a puddle and splashes pedestrian Sally Seddon. She is furious as she's on her way to a job interview. He takes her back to No.13 to dry off. Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) has heard of the Seddons and shows her dislike of her. Kevin goes on a date with Sally. Kevin is annoyed when Hilda keeps on about how unsuitable Sally is compared to Michelle Robinson, Kevin takes Sally to tea at No.13 so Hilda can get to know her. When Sally makes an insulting comment about Eddie Yeats (Geoffrey Hughes), they are soon shouting at each other. Hilda asks Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro) and Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) to try to get Kevin away from Sally by taking him on a lads' night out. Kevin introduces Sally to the lads; they think she's fantastic. Hilda does her best to stop Kevin from seeing Sally. Sally tells Hilda that she has no right to be so protective of Kevin; she's not his mother. Kevin gets annoyed when Sally keeps standing him up and missing dates. Hilda tells Kevin that she's seen Sally with a man. He is distraught, accuses Hilda of lying and slams out of the house. Sally confesses that she was out with another lad; it was Alex, her ex-boyfriend. She saw him to make sure that he knew that they were finished. Kevin feels a bit better. Hilda fears that Kevin is gone for good. Hilda is pleased when Kevin returns. He apologises about his behaviour. She doesn't mind but is annoyed to find that he's still seeing Sally. Terry takes Sally on to run the office at the Builder's Yard at £1 an hour. Curly thinks that it's a bad move. Sally decides to continue claiming the dole despite having this new job. Kevin doesn't like the idea of Sally working with Terry. Curly has nobody to take to Susan Barlow (Wendy Jane Walker)'s twenty- first so Sally offers to set him up with her friend Lois Fairhurst. Kevin doesn't like the way Sally flirts with Terry. Sally is thrilled when Terry kisses her. Kevin is furious when Terry tells him that Sally is fair game. Kevin warns him to keep his hands off her. Sally enjoys canoodling with Terry in the Yard whilst continuing to see Kevin. Curly is upset at the way Terry is mucking around with Sally. He asks Terry to lay off but Terry laughs it off, threatening to thump him if he doesn't keep his mouth shut. Kevin calls at the Yard and finds Sally and Terry together. He goes for Terry, hitting him. They fight in the Yard. Terry sports a black eye, having come out of the fight worse. Sally refuses to take the blame for the fight; it's not her fault if lads get jealous over her. Kevin is upset that he's finished with Sally and upset that he couldn't trust his friends. Terry tires of hearing people talking about Kevin giving him a pasting. He rows with him, wanting another fight but Hilda stops them and lectures them on the value of friendship. Sally begins to find Terry a bit ignorant. Sally tells Kevin that she's sorry she went out with Terry. She tells him she wants to go out with him and she swears that she is serious about him. Kevin is pleased. Kevin is set upon by Terry and Sally to hold a party at No.13. Sally tells Kevin that she's going to spend the night with him. Sally has spent the night with Kevin at No.13. Sally is upset when her mother throws her out after discovering that she spent the night with a man. Kevin takes her in. With Hilda returning, Sally clears her things out of No.13. Hilda returns from Torquay. Kevin explains that Sally is homeless. Hilda is forced to let Sally stay when Kevin threatens to leave and walk the streets with Sally. Hilda learns that Sally has been staying at No.13 during her absence. Hilda tells Kevin that Sally must leave, immediately; they've misused her house. Elsie Seddon (Brenda Elder) tracks Sally down and demands she hand over her dole money so she can buy husband Eddie (James Duggan) beer. Hilda witnesses this and is shocked that the Seddons care so little for Sally. Hilda tells Sally she can stay until she finds somewhere else to live; she doesn't want Sally to have to live with her father. Hilda doesn't like leaving Sally and Kevin alone at No.13 and monitors their every move. Hilda refuses to accept housekeeping money from Sally, feeling it would bind her legally. Kevin tells Sally he wants to move into a flat with her – she is delighted. Hilda is mortified at the thought of Kevin and Sally living together. Kevin and Sally go to Sheffield for an all-night pop concert. Kevin and Sally return at 5.30 am from Sheffield. They spot smoke coming out of the Rovers' door. Sally wakes the residents whilst Kevin tries to wake Bet. Hilda knows Sally and Kevin are spending their nights together. Hilda lays a trap for Sally on the stairs. She forgets about it and falls down the stairs herself. Sally and Kevin marry in 1986 and buy No.13 from Hilda when she leaves the area to become housekeeper to Dr. Lowther in Derbyshire. In 1990, Sally gets pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl in the back of Don Brennan's (Geoffrey Hinsliff) taxi on Christmas Eve. She names the baby Rosie (Emma Collinge, Helen Flanagan) because the taxi is parked on Rosamund Street. Sally falls pregnant again in 1994 and \\"Lauren\\" (Ashleigh Middleton, Emma Woodward, Brooke Vincent) is born in early November. The name \\"Lauren\\" does not last as Rosie always calls her younger sister Sophie, so she and Kevin change her name to Sophie. Sally also decides to go back to work, getting a job at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) factory in 1996. Sally's mother has a stroke in 1997 and Sally goes to Scarborough to look after her. This makes Kevin feel neglected and begins an affair with his business partner, Natalie Horrocks (Denise Welch). When Sally returns to Weatherfield, she knows that something is wrong, and eventually catches Kevin and Natalie in bed together. Sally throws Kevin out and he moves in with Natalie. Angry, Sally gets mechanic Chris Collins (Matthew Marsden) to let her into Natalie's house and promptly floods it. Natalie threatens Sally with legal action, causing them to fight in the Street. Sally has a brief fling with Chris Collins but eventually forgives Kevin and by Christmas 1997, the Websters are reunited. In 1999, she has an affair with Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington). Kevin finds out and he throws Sally out so she moves in with Greg and they agree on a separation, but not custody of the girls. Greg hits Sally after an argument and she leaves him, asking Kevin to take the girls as Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) does not have room for all of them but when she rents number 6, Kevin refuses to let the girls move in with her. So she takes him to court for custody and wins. Kevin, however, takes this badly and disappears, returning six weeks later, having had a breakdown. On the eve of Kevin's wedding to Alison Wakefield (Naomi Radcliffe), Sally sleeps with Kevin. In 2001, the couple plan to wed, but Kevin becomes more and more jealous. He vanishes, making Sally worry about his whereabouts. Kevin turns up at Sally's hen night and says that he still loves her. Sally later confesses to her ex-fiancé, Danny Hargreaves (Richard Standing), that she and Kevin slept together on the eve of his wedding to Alison, and Danny leaves her and the Street. In 2002, Sally suggests to Kevin that he move back into Number 13 and they remarry later that year. Sally, looking for something challenging in the employment stakes, takes a job as a personal assistant to prosperous garage owner, Ian Davenport (Philip Bretherton). They met at a local private school, Oakhill, as Rosie is friends with Ian's daughter. Unfortunately, she takes the fling more seriously than him as he sees her simply as one in a long succession of women. When he finishes with her, she is bitter and resentful as she risked her family for a fling and it stings even more because Kevin knows Sally was unfaithful but is willing to overlook it. Sally turns her ambitions to her daughter, Rosie. When Rosie shows an interest in being a pop star, Sally pushes her onto the stage where she is miserable. In a particularly humorous event, Sally is indignant when Ken Barlow (William Roache) misspells Rosie's name in a review of her school show. She is unhappy about Rosie dating Craig Harris (Richard Fleeshman), a local lad whose family has a past, (too much like her own). When she learns that they are sleeping together, she drags to Rosie to the doctor and is disappointed that he praises Rosie for being sensible enough to take precautions. Sally's emotions and nerves crumble as she takes Rosie on a wild drive across the M62 en route to a boarding school but loses control of the car, almost killing them both. Kevin catches up and cradles his wife, who admits she is disappointed with life in a back street, saying she just wanted more for her children than she had. In 2007, Sally decides to take an A-Level in English literature and has private lessons with John Stape (Graeme Hawley). Sally becomes obsessed with John, making Fiz (Jennie McAlpine) (John's girlfriend) jealous. This leads to a misunderstanding when Sally gets something in her eye and John tries to remove it just as Fiz and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) enter the factory. As they are standing so close together, Fiz thinks that they are kissing and slaps Sally. Fiz is right about Sally's feelings for John and Sally eventually tells John how she feels but he lets her down gently, as he is having an affair with Rosie instead. This is revealed on Christmas Day that year when John accidentally gives Fiz and Rosie the wrong presents. In 2008 the Websters swap houses with the Peacocks who are having financial difficulties and move into Number 4. Following the move, Sally becomes extremely house-proud, frequently boasting about the house's conservatory and size compared to other houses on the street. In 2009, Kevin develops feelings for Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), wife of his employee/friend, Tyrone (Alan Halsall). Molly takes an interest in the business and shares the bookkeeping with Sally, spending more time with Kevin. Eventually, he tells Molly how he feels. Molly is initially horrified but later tells him that she is flattered and they begin an affair, first sleeping together when Kevin sneaks away from Sally's birthday party. Afterwards, Kevin feels guilty and decides to end it before it gets out of hand by persuading Tyrone to take Molly on holiday. They resume the affair in August, agreeing to tell their respective spouses and leave them but Kevin ends things with Molly instead, after learning that Sally has breast cancer. After breaking the difficult news to Rosie and Sophie, Sally has a lumpectomy to remove the growth, which proves successful. She visits her sister while recovering from her treatment, returning in July, celebrating her birthday with her family. In December 2010, Molly admits her affair with Kevin and that he is the father of her son, Jack, named after Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey) by Tyrone. Just after shocking Sally with this revelation, she dies. Sally confronts Kevin and orders him to tell Tyrone and leave. Sally tells Rita and she suggests she move on. Later, Kevin tries to win her back but she's not interested and Rosie and Sophie agree, telling him to leave for good. Sally states seeing him with Jack makes her hate him even more and wants to be rid of them both. After a desperate plea from Sophie, Sally allows him to stay for Christmas Day but on New Year's Eve, Kevin accepts he's not wanted and baby Jack is Tyrone's son and leaves alone. However, Tyrone is equally devastated when he learns about Kevin and Molly's affair and unable to look at Jack now, he gives Jack to Kevin. Sally kisses Tyrone just after the New Year but nothing happens. Although she lies to Kevin, telling him that she wanted to hurt him as he hurt her when he had the affair. This leads to Kevin and Tyrone fighting and Kevin decides to sell the house & freezes all joint bank accounts. Sally tells Kevin that she lied to him about sleeping with Tyrone and they agree to a truce but when Kevin suggests giving their marriage another go and starting a new family, Sally is adamant that she will not have him back. After being fired by Underworld boss Carla Connor (Alison King) because of the company's financial difficulties, Sally complains to Carla's ex-business partner/former fiancé, Frank (Andrew Lancel), who employs her and promotes her to line supervisor. At the same time, her relationship with Rosie's agent, Jeff, ends after the Weatherfield Gazette publish a story detailing Sally's cancer, Kevin's infidelity, baby Jack and Sophie's sexuality – information provided by Jeff. Sally soon finds herself drawn to Frank and makes it clear that she does not believe Carla's claims that he raped her and the pair form a mutual attraction for one another. However, on 2 March 2012, Sally sees Frank's true colours when his mother tells Sally that Frank does not love her and is having an affair with Jenny Sumner (Niky Wardley). A shocked Sally confronted Frank and he admits the affair and that he did rape Carla, warning her not to cross him as the last woman who did 'lived to regret it'. Sally is devastated by this and Kevin offers her support, threatening to murder Frank and then on 5 March, Sally finds Frank dead in the factory. She is found standing over him with blood on her hands but did not kill him as he was bludgeoned to death with a whiskey bottle. However, due to recent events, Sally is a suspect but she attends his funeral and is puzzled when Anne (Gwen Taylor), Frank's mother, leaves the crematorium, during the service and visits her. Sally finds Anne holding Frank's missing watch, which was missing from his personal possessions on the day he died and she admits having it all along and Sally realises that Anne killed Frank in a fit of rage as she heard him admitting to Carla that he did rape her. A horrified Sally then tries to leave but falls on the stairs, hitting her head on the wooden banister, knocking her unconscious. As Carla and Kevin arrived, an ambulance is called and Anne is arrested. Sally and Kevin begin to rekindle their romance and relationship as Sally realises that she still loves Kevin and he has stood by her regardless. Unfortunately though Sally cannot accept Jack. With Kevin away in Germany, Sally begins a relationship with Tim Metcalfe. At first, Tim is put off by Sally planning to book a holiday to France and lies that he has to leave for work reasons. When Tim returns, he prepares to break up with Sally but later reconsiders when he realises he has feelings for her. However, Tim is later unimpressed when Sally leaves his daughter Faye by herself, although Faye and her friend Grace lied about the amount of time Sally left them on their own for. Tim and Sally later get engaged however she kisses Kevin and he finds out. Sally, presumably having a breakdown of some sort still goes to the wedding and Tim eventually turns up after Kevin talked him round. They then married happily in front of the guests. In 2017, Sally receives a call from the hospital saying her cancer is back. However, Rosie and Sophie learn that it was a malicious prank call from a person on social media. Creation=Casting= Sally as she appeared in 1986. Auditions were held for the part of Sally with actress Sally Dynevor (then going by her maiden name of Sally Whittaker) securing the role. Dynevor had previously auditioned twice for two different Coronation Street characters. The first was the milkman's eldest daughter, and the second a girlfriend of Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). She got neither role, the latter because the girlfriend was meant to be posh. Interviewed for The People's Soap Special, Dynevor spoke about how terrifying her first episode was to film because she had not done any TV work prior to the role and the scene involved one of the show's best known characters, Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander). =Characterisation= Sally is described as ambitious, sometimes even arrogant, and is considered by various Street residents (Janice Battersby in particular) to be quite snobby. Such behaviour is apparent in her attempts to live above her station. In the past she has pressured her family to do much of what she tells them. She tried to force her daughter Rosie into a prestigious school; Rosie did not want to go. Another event saw her become envious of a friend's large house. Once, in fear of being constantly regarded by her daughters as the \\"bad guy\\", Sally would intentionally act passive and forgiving whenever the girls acted up, making Kevin out to be the mean, unfair parent when he scolded them for their behaviour. Kevin eventually got his revenge when he and the girls trashed their house while Sally was out. When she returned home and saw the mess, she couldn't keep up her act and became angry, feeling as though her role in the family was unimportant. Kevin told her otherwise, declaring that she always keeps the family in order and on their toes, and that she is genuinely appreciated by all. In a 2008 interview with newspaper The People, Sally Dynevor expressed her delight with Sally's ever evolving personality: \\"After more than 20 years, I still get the same pang of excitement over a good script as I did when I first joined the show. Sally meddles in everyone else's business and thinks she is so much better than the rest of them but really she is just the same. There aren't many dull moments. Sally is a fabulous character and I know I am so lucky to play her. All those years ago when I started she wasn't like this so I am so pleased that the producers have made her change. It has only been over the last five years that she has turned into a right cow. That is brilliant because it means I can show what I can do as an actress. I know some viewers hate her, others love her, but I am pleased she is talked about. I hope she carries on being like this for a very long time to come.\\" In an interview with Woman magazine in 2015, Dynevor praised soap writers for reinventing Sally. She said: \\"After 29 years in Coronation Street, I feel like I'm 'reinventing' Sally a little bit and I really like that. I've had to change with the times, otherwise I'd have been left behind. I'm getting a lot more comedy now, and Joe Duttine [Tim] and I can't stop laughing – which is great. He's so funny and we work well together.\\" Development=Relationship with Kevin Webster= Shortly after Sally's arrival in 1986 she was paired with Kevin Webster portrayed by Michael Le Vell and they then went on to get married and have two daughters Rosie and Sophie. Their marriage was on and off a number of times mainly due to either one of them having an affair. In 2009, Kevin went on to have an affair with Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns) resulting in Kevin getting Molly pregnant and her giving birth to a baby boy named Jack. Kevin revealed all to Sally in the Christmas Day 2009 episode; where Sally ended the marriage. In 2011, Le Vell backed a Sally and Kevin reunion stating; \\"I think they could definitely get back together, but I don't know when or how they could make it work as long as Sally accepts baby Jack.\\" Dynevor added: \\"So many people have said it just wouldn't be right if Sally and Kevin weren't together. But I'm sure it would be really difficult for her to accept Jack as her own. Could you do that?\\" In 2015, Sally was involved in a surprise kiss with Kevin whilst being in a relationship and engaged to Kevin's best friend Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine). Asked if Kevin has feelings for Sally, Le Vell replied: \\"He'll always have feelings for her, as they were together for a long time. He'll always love her, but they just hurt each other too many times and too much water has passed under the bridge. Never say never but I think Sally and Tim are a great couple and Kevin enjoys seeing them together as well. They've got that harmonious relationship where he's still got Sally and Sophie in his life and he's got a new best mate in Tim.\\" Asked about Kevin's reaction to the kiss Le Vell replied: \\"He's in total shock and disbelief. After about five seconds, that is when the realisation sinks in. He does respond at first but then he realises this is wrong. He is genuinely shocked. He knows deep down Sally didn't mean it, it is just a spur of the moment thing. Sally and Kevin do both feel genuinely bad afterwards for Tim because it was something and nothing. Obviously you wouldn't like it if your real life partner did it, but it didn't mean anything and they were married for over 20 years, not that that makes it okay! They're both full of remorse, even though it's not really Kevin's fault, Sally does pounce on him but he still feels guilty.\\" =Breast cancer= In September 2009, it was revealed that Sally would fall victim to breast cancer. Speaking of the plot, Dynevor said, \\"I do know women who have suffered or are suffering from breast cancer. For the last year, I have been fund-raising for breast cancer charities and am a long-standing patron for The Genesis Appeal. So, when I was told about this storyline I was determined to do it justice for all the women out there who are going through what Sally is. A few years ago, I found a lump and was sent to get it checked out straight away. I was lucky that it proved to be nothing but the time spent waiting to find out the results was agonising.\\" A Coronation Street spokesman added, \\"Breast cancer is a disease which affects so many women and their families. We are keen to ensure that the storyline accurately reflects the many problems and issues faced by breast cancer sufferers.\\" In May 2010 it was revealed that at the same time as her character found out that she had cancer, Dynevor herself discovered that hours after filming Sally's cancer revealing scenes, she was also suffering from the disease. Whittaker explained that she found a lump in her breast while preparing for a storyline in which her character Sally Webster has the disease: \\"If I had not been researching this storyline I may not have discovered the lump in my breast and had it looked at so quickly, as a result of the early diagnosis, my treatment has been successful and I am able to return to work next month. This storyline could very well have saved my life.\\" =Relationship with Tim Metcalfe= In 2013, Sally began a relationship with Tim Metcalfe portrayed by (Joe Duttine). Dynevor revealed that even though Sally likes Tim she would like him to make some improvements to his lifestyle and commented on ITV Daybreak; \\"He's a bit of a commitment- phobe so I'm not sure [what will happen], but he's nice and Sally really likes him. She's trying to change him – manipulate him into what she wants! But he's not having it and he wants to go off down the pub, and doesn't want to spend any romantic weekends with her or anything. He's a real bloke – he wants his tea on the table!\\" Dynevor admitted; \\"I didn't really want Sally to find someone at first, but I like this relationship because she's not found 'Mr Perfect'. All the other men Sally's been with, I could easily have seen her having long term relationships with them. With Tim, you know there's no way they're going to live happily ever after, they're going to drive each other insane. I like the drama that has to offer.\\" In 2015, it was revealed that Tim would propose to Sally. Asked how Sally feels about Tim, Dynevor said: \\"I think she really loves Tim and she really cares for him but she's hoping she's going to be able to change him into the man she's always wanted to be with.\\" Asked how Sally reacts to the proposal Dunevor said: \\"It does come out of the blue to Sally. They have spoken about getting married in the past then decided they were happy just to be living together, so it does come as a shock. But I think the fact that he gets down on one knee, he's got the music, he's bought the ring and he does it in front of everybody does mean Sally's thrilled.\\" =Politics= In December 2015, it was revealed that producers were lining up a plot which would see Sally team up with her neighbours in a bid to tackle several issues in the area. Sally Dynevor, told Inside Soap: \\"There is no sign of Sally's ambition waning – she is going to be taking on local politics in 2016. Tim isn't bothered at all. He just stands behind her, raising eyebrows. But it's a great storyline – we've already started filming it and it has been really fun. Sally has Ken, Norris and Mary on board with her – so I reckon she is going to do quite well!\\" Backing the storyline, Dynevor admitted that she is delighted with the direction Sally is going in at the moment. It has been great to have such lovely feedback from everyone,\\" she said. \\"The scriptwriters are writing so much comedy for Sally right now and I love it – long may it continue.\\" Reception Dynevor was nominated in the category of \\"Best Actress\\" at The British Soap Awards 2011. She won \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" at The British Soap Awards 2015. In February 2006, the storyline involving Sally driving Rosie to a moor and scolding her for her unruly behaviour came under criticism from Winnie Johnson, the mother of Moors Murders victim Keith Bennett due to the scenes being filmed at Saddleworth Moor where her son's body is thought to be buried. Winnie Johnson criticised the storyline stating, \\"This is outrageous and plain disgusting. Are they going out of their way to be sick? I lost my son out on those moors but to film a child abduction up there after everything that has happened is a disgrace.\\" A Coronation Street spokesman defended the storyline. Low Culture columnist Ruth Deller praised Sally Dynevor's work on the show during 2010: \\"It's all too easy to overlook long-term characters as being worthy of praise, but since Sally Dynevor returned to the Street this year, she has been on fire. Name checking Mary Queen of Scots, dishing out incredible one-liners, being the stand-out performer in the live episodes and handling the Sophie/Sian and Kevin/Molly situations perfectly, both actress and character have cemented their place in our collective hearts. People like Sally tend to miss out on soap awards and suchlike because they’re always there, but maybe, just maybe her recent work will be noticed and she’ll get some acknowledgement in the next lot of gongs.\\" A columnist writing for TV Buzz said that Sally does not \\"give a damn\\" about what people think of her, because if she did she would have \\"fled Weatherfield a long time ago\\". They said that during her storyline with Frank, Sally took her \\"Miss Independent act a step too far\\" by romancing him. A reporter for the Western Mail branded Sally \\"Ms Holier-than- Thou\\" and said \\"It's a tribute to Sally Dynevor's acting skills that she makes many of us want to reach through the TV, give her a good shake and yell: \\"Listen to Carla and Maria!\\" ReferencesExternal links *Sally Webster at itv.com Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional factory workers Category:Fictional machinists Category:Television characters introduced in 1986 Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:Fictional characters with cancer Category:Fictional councillors Category:Fictional mayors Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Sally Webster"},{"id":"2275442","text":"Hurricane Kenna (2002) was a Category 5 hurricane that made landfall in Mexico as a strong Category 4 hurricane, killing 4 and causing $122 million in damage.

The title was created in 1998 by President Leonid Kuchma and as of 15 September 2020 the total number of awards is 467. The title is granted to two different order recipients, a civilian Order of State and a military Order of Gold Star. The first foreigner awarded the award was Belarusian Mikhail Zhyzneuski in June 2017.Belarusian Killed On Kyiv's Maidan Honored As Hero Of Ukraine, Radio Free Europe (14 June 2017) History The origin of the \\"Hero of Ukraine\\" award can be traced to the Hero of the Soviet Union (established 16 April 1934) and the Hero of Socialist Labor (27 December 1938), the highest decorations established in the Soviet Union, of which Ukraine was a constituent republic. Most of the recipients of the former title received it for heroic military action (with Soviet cosmonauts being a notable exception), while those awarded the latter were recognized for their contributions to national economy and culture. The awards could be given to the same individual more than once, and only the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet could deprive a recipient of the award once given. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, similar awards were created in the resulting independent countries, including Ukraine. Creation The title Hero of Ukraine was created on 23 August 1998 with Edict #944/98 by President Leonid Kuchma. Similar in structure to the titles issued by the Soviet Union, the title is awarded in two distinctions: \\"The Order of the Gold Star\\" and \\"The Order of the State\\". Unlike the Soviet awards, Ukrainian law allows a person to receive a title in each distinction only once, although the person may receive both levels in due course. This means that if a holder of the Order of the State performs a heroic action, he or she can be presented with the Order of the Gold Star. Vice versa, if labor achievements of a holder of the Order of the Gold Star are recognized to be of exceptional value to the nation, the recipient can be eligible to receive the Order of the State. Either of the distinctions can be presented posthumously, and a hero may only have his title removed by the president if they are convicted of a serious crime. Design Two medals were created by Ukrainian law to differentiate between the titles. They have several common features; both medals use a ribbon long and wide and are divided equally into two bands along its length, with a blue band on the left and a yellow band on the right, matching the colors of the Ukrainian flag. Connected to the ribbon is a suspension device joined to a medallion, both of which are made out of gold. On both medals, the name of each decoration and the award number are engraved on the reverse side of the medallion. Below the ribbon of the Order of the Gold Star, the golden suspension device contains a small engraving of the trident representing the Ukrainian Coat of Arms. The medallion is shaped like a five-pointed star wide from one point to the other, and is set within a wreath of oak leaves. Two smaller five-pointed stars are engraved within the larger star. In contrast, the medallion for the Order of the State has the trident of Prince Volodymyr of Kyiv (St. Vladimir) placed on top of a wreath of oak leaves. The size of the medallion is high and wide. There is no special design or symbol engraved on the suspension device. In addition to the formal award, recipients of either level are given a copy for use in public. Only one design of the wearer's copy exists, being modeled after the Soviet hero medal with the red ribbon replaced by a blue and yellow ribbon. The trident, which is used on the coat of arms of Ukraine, is placed in the middle of the star. This medal is made out of non-precious metals and is worn on the wearer's left-hand side above all other decorations. Regulations Two different regulations were issued by President Kuchma: the edict of 1998 and a new edict in 2002. The edict of 2002 voided the edict of 1998 as it was issued after the law on state awards and confirmed the status of the title in 2000. The 1998 edict contained general guidelines about the title. Some of the subjects mentioned were the criteria for receiving each level of the title, who can present the title, and how the medal should be displayed in public. The decree specified the title as being awarded to citizens of Ukraine for heroism and labor achievements. It stipulated that only the president could award the title, though certain other bodies of the Ukrainian Government could recommend people to receive it. The edict also allowed for special benefits, including increased pay, social security, and health care, which heroes could use until their death. The decree also covered the topics of duplicate medals and the display, ownership and storage of the insignia. The new 2002 regulations differ only slightly from the original ones. The designs of the medals were not changed, the new edict introduced the measurements of the miniature medal, or the \\"wearer's copy\\". Article 4 outlines the details on the ownership of the insignia and special procedures for the medals to be displayed in museums. =Display= The medal, which is presented with the title, is always worn on the left side of a business or suit jacket and is worn above any other medals and decorations awarded by Ukraine. If a person has been awarded both levels of the title then the Order of the Gold Star medal is placed to the right of the Order of the State medal. A copy of the medal, made out of non-precious metals, can be presented to the hero for daily wear that can be substituted with a ribbon bar, measuring x , if wearing the medal is not permitted. Another copy of the decoration, called the miniature badge, is worn above the ribbon bars on the left side of the uniform. Procedure In order for a person to be awarded the title, a recommendation must be made to the President by the Verkhovna Rada (parliament of Ukraine), the Cabinet of Ukraine (Government of Ukraine), the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Higher Economic Court, the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, ministries and other central executive authorities, the Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblast, Kyiv and Sevastopol city state administrations, as well as Commission on state awards and heraldry of the President of Ukraine. The recommendations are then sent to the President for consideration, along with a package composed of the details of the nominee's deeds and the recommendations that have been filed on his or her behalf. If the President agrees with the recommendation, he will issue a decree to award the person the title, which includes receiving a medal, miniature badge and certificate at a ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv. Recipients Georgiy Gongadze, journalist, founder of a popular Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, who was kidnapped and murdered in 2000 Vitali Klitschko Recipients have been awarded the Hero of Ukraine title for a variety of accomplishments. The first to receive the title — in 1998 – was Borys Paton. He was recognised for studies in metallurgy of electrical welding and has been President of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine since 1962. Other science-related honors were given to Platon Kostyuk, for his work in neurophysiology, and Valerii Kazakov for his work in medicine, The title is often awarded to athletes and other sports-related personalities. Vitali Klitschko, a heavyweight boxing champion was given the level \\"Order of the Gold Star\\" in 2004 as was Andriy Shevchenko, 2004 European Footballer of the Year and two-time winner of the Serie A scoring title. and Valeriy Lobanovskyi, the former coach of the football club FC Dynamo Kyiv, died on 13 May 2002 in hospital after he passed out during a game.

Yana Klochkova, who won gold medals in swimming at the Athens and Sydney Olympic Games was awarded the title \\"in recognition of Klochkova's outstanding services to Ukraine and her efforts to build up the country's reputation in the Olympic arena.\\" People involved in the arts and literature have also received the award.

On 22 January, on the Ukrainian Unity Day, President Petro Poroshenko handed the medal to Filaret. Controversial awards There have been allegations that some members of Kuchma's inner circle, mainly Viktor Medvedchuk, may have masterminded inappropriate awards of Ukrainian decorations and titles, including the Hero of Ukraine title. Police, according to the Associated Press, sent summons to Medvedchuk on 15 July 2005, inviting him for questioning about these awards. Kuchma and Medvedchuk were also questioned on Aleksandr Bartenev's Hero of Ukraine title. Bartenev, known also as \\"Major\\", an alleged gangster, is currently facing legal charges in Ukraine. The decision to give the award to Stepan Bandera was met with controversy, and it was later revoked. Due to these problems, President Viktor Yushchenko agreed to stop awarding state decorations starting in June 2005 until further notice. This move was announced by Ivan Vasiunyk, the First Deputy Secretary of State, and backed by Ukraine's Commission for Decorations and Heraldry. According to Vasiunyk, forty one people were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2004, with some of the awards being presented during the election period. Vasiunyk said that \\"I don't think you know a third of these names\\", referring to those who were presented with the hero title that year. The Commission agreed not to strip anyone of their decorations, unless Ukrainian law would permit them to do so. Despite the announcement of suspension in giving out awards, two posthumous titles were awarded in July 2005 to Oles Honchar and Vadym Hetman. The decision by Yushchenko, in his last days in office in January 2010, to award World War II Ukrainian nationalist and accused Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera with the Hero of Ukraine caused an uproar in Russia, Poland, and other countries, including Ukraine itself. It was condemned by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and other Jewish groups around the world, Polish President Lech Kaczyński, the Russian Foreign Ministry, Soviet Army veteran groups, and prominent Ukrainian politicians such as Sergei Tigipko and Konstantin Zarudnev. Zarudnev, an MP representing Sevastopol, went as far as burning his Ukrainian passport in protest. At the same time the decree that had given Bandera the award was applauded by Ukrainian nationalists in western Ukraine and by a number of Ukrainian-Americans.Analysis: Ukraine leader struggles to handle Bandera legacy, Kyiv Post (13 April 2010).

The above procedure in both cases has not been observed, and therefore the legal consequences of decisions taken by courts, as well as the legitimacy of these decisions is highly controversial.

First appearing in the role in November 1979, he played it continually from 1981 to 2010. Early life and education Tarmey was born in Ardwick, Manchester, Lancashire. Shortly after his birth, he moved with his family to live in Bradford, Manchester, where he was also educated. Following the death of his father William in 1944 whilst driving an ambulance at the Battle of Arnhem during the Second World War, his mother Lilian remarried, to Robert Cleworth. Tarmey attended the Bradford Memorial School and the Queens Street School (which became the Philips Park Secondary Modern School). On leaving school, he was apprenticed to his stepfather, who was an asphalt spreader by trade. He also worked in the construction industry for a number of years. Career In 1968, Tarmey gave up his job in the building industry to work as a nightclub singer and entertainer. In order to supplement his income, he took on work as an extra on shows such as Coronation Street, amongst others. Despite suffering a serious heart attack in 1976 and a stroke in 1977, he was eventually offered the role of Jack Duckworth, a character who would go on to become an institution in British soap operas. He underwent quintuple bypass surgery in 1987, and had a pacemaker fitted after suffering a second heart attack in 2002, which was used as a storyline in Coronation Street to explain his absence. He also developed sleep apnoea, disrupting his breathing while asleep. Tarmey was an extra in the Granada Television adaptation of King Lear (1983) which starred Laurence Olivier in the title role. He was an accomplished singer and released several albums. Four of his albums, A Gift of Love (1993), Time for Love (1994), After Hours (1996) and In My Life (2001) appeared on the UK Albums Chart, as well as three singles charting on the UK Singles Chart. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1992 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel on the set of Coronation Street. He has also appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank. Departure from Coronation Street In April 2006, when he turned 65, Tarmey announced he was thinking of retiring, which prompted letters of protest from fans. In 2009, he wanted to leave his role in the long-running television series, Coronation Street, due to his multiple health problems, which included severe breathing problems. The show's producers, however, persuaded him to stay until the 50th anniversary, in December of the following year. News of his departure was announced on 9 April 2010. Commenting, he said, \\"I've had the most amazing 30 years playing Jack. Because of him I've made fantastic friends and travelled all over the world. I'll be sorry to say goodbye\\". Tarmey's departure was pushed forward to 8 November 2010 episode because of his declining health; in this episode Jack died asleep in his chair in a manner similar to the death of Vera (although Jack had a storyline illness). Tarmey was the second longest serving male actor in the show. In a March 2011 interview with Nigel Pivaro, Tarmey revealed he also had to leave the series because his son Carl had been diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009. Autobiography Tarmey's autobiography, Jack Duckworth and Me: My Life on the Street and Other Adventures, was published in 2010. Personal life In 1955, he met his future wife Ali in the local youth club. The couple married in 1962, and had two children: Carl (1966–2019) and Sara (born 1970). Tarmey suffered from poor health for many years, having a severe heart attack at the age of 35 and also a stroke when he was 36. He had heart bypass surgery twice, once in 1987 and again (following another heart attack) in 2002. He and his wife Ali lived in Ashton-under-Lyne. He also suffered from sleep apnoea due to breathing problems. Despite his multiple health problems, Tarmey refused to quit smoking. In May 2011 Tarmey revealed that he needed to undergo further heart surgery. Death A Coronation Street spokesman confirmed that Tarmey died in Tenerife from a heart attack on the morning of 9 November 2012 at the age of 71.

It may well have been intended as the burial place of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep I and his mother Ahmose-Nefertari. The tomb was initially attributed to Amenhotep I by Howard Carter.Porter, Bertha and Moss, Rosalind, Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Statues, Reliefs and Paintings Volume I: The Theban Necropolis, Part 2. Royal Tombs and Smaller Cemeteries, Griffith Institute. 1964, pg 599Howard Carter, Report on the Tomb of Zeser-Ka-Ra Amenhetep I, Discovered by the Earl of Carnarvon in 1914, The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 3, No. 2/3 (Apr. - Jul., 1916), pp. 147-154; via JSTOR In the article he does mention that in the scattered debris of the tomb there are as many inscriptions mentioning Ahmose-Nefertari as there are mentioning Amenhotep I so it may be that both had been buried in the tomb. In Porter and Moss the tomb is attributed to Ahmose-Nefertari based on an argument by Černý. The tomb The tomb is located on a plateau in the foothills of Dra' Abu el- Naga'. The tomb opens up to a deep pit at the entrance. Behind the pit is a gallery extending into the rock. Halfway down the gallery is a chamber on one side and a niche on the other. The gallery ends in a very deep protective well. This feature later became common in royal tombs. The well may have served a double purpose. It would have protected the tomb from floods during the rainy seasons, and provided the royal occupant with an access to the underworld.Dodson, Aidan and Ikram, Salima, The Tomb in Ancient Egypt, Thames and Hudson, 2008, pg 209 The protective well has two chambers at the bottom. These chambers may have served as a false tomb to throw off potential robbers. Beyond the well is a second gallery which leads to the burial chamber. This final chamber is rectangular in shape and features two pillars. Finds A basalt bust of a woman, who may be Ahmose-Nefertari was discovered in the tomb. The statue is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (M.M.A. 21.7.9). Fragments of stone vessels with inscriptions of Ahmose I, Ahmose-Nefertari and Amenhotep I (M.M.A.21.7.1-8.) where found in the tomb, as well as a fragment inscribed for King Apepi and a daughter named Herti.

He included both the descent into the well and the ascent from the well in the length of the tomb and comes to 120 cubits. Thereby claiming that Tomb AN B matches the dimensions of the tomb of Amenhotep I as mentioned in the papyrus. Černý later conjectures that the 'House of Amenhotep of the Garden' is to be identified with the now destroyed temple of Amenhotep I located in Deir-el- Bahari. Given that Amenhotep I's tomb is said to be located to the north of this temple, Černý concluded that the tomb was still to be discovered and should not be equated with Tomb AN B.

G. Wells. It is this plant that supposedly gives Mars its dull red colour. It is one of the several types of plants brought to Earth possibly accidentally by the invading Martians, but the only one that truly was able to adapt and grow widespread on Earth. When it is exposed to water, it grows and reproduces explosively, flooding the neighboring countryside as it clogs streams and rivers. The narrator mentions near the end of \\"The Man on Putney Hill\\" that the weed glows purple at night. He tries eating some, but it has a metallic taste. Though it engulfed the native plant life of Earth, it also succumbed to the effects of Earth bacteria. Wells' earlier short story, \\"The Crystal Egg\\", features a \\"dense, red weed\\" seen on Mars that also grows heavily on water, in this case a Martian canal. As the book has been interpreted as criticism of imperialism, the red weed could symbolize the non-native fauna colonizers introduced to the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. In many cases, these introduced species overwhelmed the native fauna, especially in remote islands. Wells may have been influenced by the theories of Camille Flammarion, who in 1873 claimed that Mars was red due to red vegetation growing on it.Mars: A History of False Impressions In other adaptations The red weed is not mentioned in the radio adaptation, and is absent from the 1953 film; however its absence fits in with the retcon established for the TV series follow-up in which the aliens originate from Mor-Tax, a garden planet. Therefore, their means of transforming the planet was actually to conserve and promote Earth's own vegetation. In Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, the red weed is given a two-part song, with eerie music to signify its slow and threatening growth over the Earth. In the live tour, CGI footage of the red weed portrayed it as a mossy creeper that grew much faster than Wells' original account. In Steven Spielberg's 2005 War of the Worlds film, the presence of the red weed on Earth is intentional. Once they have a strong hold of the planet, the invaders take captured humans and drain their blood, which act as a fertiliser for the red weed, helping it grow and cover the planet. Spielberg did state that these invaders did not come from Mars (the \\"Red Planet\\"), the script indicates the weed is abundantly present on their world as well, suggesting the two share a superficial resemblance. However, what exactly makes up their red weed, whether it is a natural vegetation or what gives it its colour on their world, is unknown; though the human blood possibly adds to its redness. In one scene, the Tripods used their tentacles to dig fiercely at the ground, which could have been when and how they planted the red weed. It grows so quickly that it can be seen growing, and it can grow on just about anything. It is also stated in the script that the weed is fierce enough to flourish in spite of the conditions that had forced the aliens to find refuge on a new world. But despite its tenacity to survive such a harsh environment, much like in the novel, Earth's pathogens kill the red weed. Crows eat some of the remains and the rest eventually become an ash-like dust which is blown away in the wind. The red weed is also depicted in the Timothy Hines film H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, which is a direct adaptation of the novel. However, it is not featured in any detail, and its presence is nothing more than as a part of the background. In fact, the term \\"red weed\\" is said only once throughout the film. The weed does not appear in the modernised, 2005 The Asylum film H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds (also entitled Invasion), but later scenes in the film show a reddish-orange colour scheme, possibly used to adapt the red weed into a more realistic aspect and to resemble the colour of Mars to symbolise the aliens' control over mankind. It is confirmed that no such weed exists by Mars Rover recordings during the opening title sequence, and the surface of the planet seen on the sequel War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave. In Stephen Baxter's sequel, The Massacre of Mankind, areas infested with the red weed and sprayed with the black smoke are still barren thirteen years after the 1907 invasion, due to the lingering toxicity. It is also present in the PC game of The War of the Worlds, where it replaces the trees if more Martian buildings and defenses are built in that sector, as well as the mobile game of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of The Worlds: Minigame Adventure. In 2012, it received its own Android game called Red Weed, where players try to stop the slimy Red Weed from spreading over the land as it changes every patch of green grass it touches into red tendrils. In Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's comic book series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II, which deals with the effects of the Martian invasion within a wider fictional context, the red weed is deliberately employed by the Martians as an anti-shipping weapon, in order to prevent Captain Nemo's submarine, the Nautilus, from providing effective resistance to the Martian invasion, after the Invisible Man warns them of the Nautilus' capabilities. In the comic sequel to the story, Scarlet Traces, the red weed has been farmed because its oil is the only thing that can lubricate the adapted Martian technology. As one character points out, this suggests that the Martians brought it to Earth on purpose. In the 2019 miniseries by the BBC, the red weed manifests after the Martians have died off. Unlike in the novel where it succumbs alongside the Martians to Earth's pathogens; years after the miniseries' initial time frame, the red weed has apparently covered virtually all of Earth (as seen from space), turning the continents bright-red and the oceans dark-red (the character Ogilvy mentions Earth's waters are clogged with the weed), and eliminating biodiversity due to choking Earth's flora and ecosystems. Characters Ogilvy and Amy eventually discover that typhoid salmonella can kill the weed off, though it's left ambiguous whether or not the solution becomes widespread as the village preacher they take their results to is dismissive. The red weed furthermore sprouts red crystals where it grows. Its effects on Earth's ecosystem also cause the sky to turn red during the day and purple at night, and have rendered the sky permanently hazy.

Retrieved on July 12, 2007. Swaraj lays stress on governance, not by a hierarchical government, but by self governance through individuals and community building. The focus is on political decentralisation.Parel, Anthony. Hind Swaraj and other writings of M. K. Gandhi. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 1997. Since this is against the political and social systems followed by Britain, Gandhi's concept of Swaraj advocated India's discarding British political, economic, bureaucratic, legal, military, and educational institutions.What is Swaraj?. Retrieved on March 3, 2007. S. Satyamurti, Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru were among a contrasting group of Swarajists who laid the foundation for parliamentary democracy in India. Although Gandhi's aim of totally implementing the concepts of Swaraj in India was not achieved, the voluntary work organisations which he founded for this purpose did serve as precursors and role models for people's movements, voluntary organisations, and some of the non-governmental organisations that were subsequently launched in various parts of India.What Swaraj meant to Gandhi. Retrieved on September 17, 2008. The student movement against oppressive local and central governments, led by Jayaprakash Narayan, Udit Swaraj and the Bhoodan movement, which presaged demands for land reform legislation throughout India, and which ultimately led to India's discarding of the Zamindari system of land tenure and social organisation, were also inspired by the ideas of Swaraj. Key concepts Swami Dayanand Saraswati, also known as \\"Nāri-Shudra-Vedoddharak Maharashtra Dev Dayanand Saraswati founder of the Arya Samaj and a Hindu reformer, defined swaraj as the \\"administration of self\\" or \\"democracy\\". Swami Dayanand Saraswati, beginning with the premise that God had created people free to perform any work they were inclined to choose, then questioned the legitimacy of the foreign British occupation to make the Indian nation slaves on their own land? In the Swami's view, swaraj was the basis for freedom fighting. Dadabhai Navroji said that he had learnt the word swaraj from the Satyarth Prakash of Saraswati. Swaraj warrants a stateless society. According to Mahatma Gandhi, the overall impact of the state on the people is harmful. He called the state a \\"soulless machine\\" which, ultimately, does the greatest harm to mankind.Jesudasan, Ignatius. A Gandhian theology of liberation. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 236-237. The purpose of the state is that it is an instrument of serving the people. But Gandhi feared that in the name of moulding the state into a suitable instrument of serving people, the state would abrogate the rights of the citizens and arrogate to itself the role of grand protector and demand abject acquiescence from them. This would create a paradoxical situation where the citizens would be alienated from the state and at the same time enslaved to it, which, according to Gandhi, was demoralising and dangerous. If Gandhi's close acquaintance with the working of the state apparatus in South Africa and in India strengthened his suspicion of a centralised, monolithic state, his intimate association with the Congress and its leaders confirmed his fears about the corrupting influence of political power and his scepticism about the efficacy of the party systems of power politics (due to which he resigned from the Congress on more than one occasion only to be persuaded back each time) and his study of the British parliamentary systems convinced him that representative democracy was incapable of meting out justice to people.Hind Swaraj. M.K. Gandhi. Chapter V Gandhi thought it necessary to evolve a mechanism to achieve the twin objectives of empowering the people and 'empowering' the state. It was for this that he developed the two pronged strategy of resistance (to the state) and reconstruction (through voluntary and participatory social action). Although the word \\"Swaraj\\" means self-rule, Gandhi gave it the content of an integral revolution that encompasses all spheres of life: \\"At the individual level Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self- assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance.\\"M. K. Gandhi, Young India, June 28, 1928, p. 772. Politically, swaraj is self- government and not good government (for Gandhi, good government is no substitute for self-government) and it means a continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it is foreign government or whether it is national. In other words, it is sovereignty of the people based on pure moral authority. Economically, Swaraj means full economic freedom for the toiling millions. And in its fullest sense, Swaraj is much more than freedom from all restraints, it is self-rule, self-restraint, and could be equated with moksha or salvation.\\"M. K. Gandhi, Young India, December 8, 1920, p.886 (See also Young India, August 6, 1925, p. 276 and Harijan, March 25, 1939, p.64.) Adopting Swaraj means implementing a system whereby the state machinery is virtually nil, and the real power directly resides in the hands of people. Gandhi said: \\"Power resides in the people, they can use it at any time.\\"Jesudasan, Ignatius. A Gandhian theology of liberation. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 251. This philosophy rests inside an individual who has to learn to be master of his own self and spreads upwards to the level of his community which must be dependent only on itself. Gandhi said: \\"In such a state (where swaraj is achieved) everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour.\\"Murthy, Srinivas.Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy Letters. Long Beach Publications: Long Beach, 1987, pp 13. He summarised the core principle like this: \\"It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves.\\"M. K. Gandhi. Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule. Ahmedabad, Gujarat: Navajivan Publishing House, 1938. Gandhi explained his vision in 1946: Gandhi was undaunted by the task of implementing such a utopian vision in India. He believed that by transforming enough individuals and communities, society at large would change. He said: \\"It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore not worth a single thought... Let India live for the true picture, though never realised in its completeness. We must have a proper picture of what we want before we can have something approaching it.\\"Parel, Anthony. Hind Swaraj and other writings of M. K. Gandhi. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 1997, pp 189. After Gandhi After Gandhi's assassination Vinoba Bhave formed the Sarva Seva Sangh at the national level and Sarvodya Mandals at the regional level to the carry on integrated village service — with the end purpose of achieving the goal of Swaraj. Two major nonviolent movements for socio- economic and political revolution in India: the Bhoodan movement led by Vinoba Bhave and the Total Revolution movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan were actually formed under the aegis of the ideas of Swaraj. Gandhi's model of Swaraj was almost entirely discarded by the Indian government. He had wanted a system of a classless, stateless direct democracy.Bhattacharyya, Buddhadeva. Evolution of the political philosophy of Gandhi. Calcutta Book House: Calcutta, 1969, pp 479. Additionally, modern India has kept in place many aspects of British (and Western) influence, including widespread use of the English language, the common law, industrialisation, liberal democracy, military organisation, and bureaucracy. Present day The Aam Aadmi Party was founded in late 2012, by Arvind Kejriwal and some erstwhile activists of India Against Corruption movement, with the aim of empowering people by applying the concept of Swaraj enunciated by Gandhi, in the present day context by changing the system of governance.

The species displays sexual dimorphism with males and females differing in coloration. The male has iridescent green feathers on its body and a black tail while the female has a white breast and white out tail feathers. They measure 9-10 cm and weigh about 3 grams. The species is found mainly in mountainous regions of Puerto Rico but also occurs along the southwest coast of the main island. Puerto Rican emeralds are highly territorial, often defending territories with intense aerial pursuits. Puerto Rican emeralds use their long pointed bills and long tubular tongues to probe for insects, spiders and nectar, being especially attracted to red flowers. They can breed year-round but breeding is concentrated before the wet season starts from February to May. The female lays two tiny white eggs (measuring 8–13 mm) in a nest cup made of grasses and twigs. The male plays no part in the nesting process.

Arif Hussain Hussaini, a student of Ruhollah Khomeini who led the Iranian Revolution, was the group's leader. Later in 1988, Arif Hussain Hussaini changed the name of his group from TNFJ-Arif Hussaini group to Tehrik-e- Jafaria (TJP) while Agha Syed Hamid Ali Shah Moosavi's group retained the name of TNFJ and has been operating under the same name since. The TJP founder, Arif Hussain Hussaini was assassinated in 1988 by unknown attackers; the defunct sectarian group Sipah-e-Sahaba was accused. Arif Hussain Hussaini, the patron-in-chief of the TJP, was shot dead in Peshawar near his mosque/seminary while going to lead the morning prayer on August 5, 1988. Since then, T.J.P. has been led by Hussaini's one of the foremost companions Syed Sajid Ali Naqvi. Following the death of Zia-ul-Haq, support for the TJP fell, as Pakistani Shias went back to pre-Zia-ul-Haq political loyalties, with many no longer feeling under threat. Furthermore, the elections of moderate Benazir Bhutto also gave increased confidence to Shia Muslims and they were no longer under threat and the discrimination ended even though it still exist against the Pakistani Shias. Jafaria Students Organization Pakistan, founded in 1997, is the student wing of TJP. Ideology According to TJP, Islam is and was the basic ideology of Pakistan; by deviating this ideology a conspiracy was made to make Pakistan a sectarian state in the period of General Zia-ul-Haq, a dictator. At this stage, the formation of TNFJ was deemed necessary for the failure of this conspiracy. The main objective of this organisation was to protect the rights of Shia Muslims of Pakistan and give them a voice in the Parliament of Pakistan. They do not advocate a Shia Islamic state and have cordial relations with Sunni organization including Sunni Ittehad Council, that is why they joined the coalition of religious political parties Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal that won 53 out of 272 elected members in legislative elections held on October 20, 2002. Sanctions On January 12, 2002, the TJP was banned along with three terrorist organizations, by the government of Pakistan. The TJP was banned twice by Pervez Musharraf's government and in January 2002, its leaders were arrested. The T.J.P. was banned again on November 5, 2011, while Pakistan's Shias experienced increasing attacks since 2005 by the Pakistani Taliban, Sipah-e-Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jundullah and Jaish-e-Mohammed, Although TJP has been designated as a \\"terrorist organisation\\", Qazi Hussain Ahmad, a senior member of Pakistani Parliament and the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's oldest Islamist party, says the banned groups have no ties with the militants. He notes that one organization is part of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, the major opposition alliance of religious parties, which also includes Ahmad's group. Coalition It was a part of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal coalition of Islamist political parties that won 11.3% of the popular vote and 53 out of 272 seats in the legislative elections held on October 20, 2002. In May 2008, it was reported that Jamaat- e-Islami Pakistan's emir Qazi Hussain Ahmad was considered heading the six- party Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal. Qazi Hussain Ahmad said that he would consider rejoining the MMA after consulting with the executive council of his party and some other seniors. Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)'s chief Fazl-ur-Rahman had tasked Sajid Naqvi of TJP with contacting Qazi Hussain Ahmad and bringing him round to rejoining the alliance. Tehrik-e-Jafaria Pakistan, also known as Tehrik-e- Islami, should not be confused with a short-lived outfit named Tehrik-e-Islami that was one of three groups of Pakistani Taliban operating during 2008 in Darra Adam Khel, a semi-tribal area known officially as the Frontier Region of Kohat. The Tehrik-e-Islami and the Pakistan Taliban became active in the area in mid-2007. The former Tehrik-e-Islami was founded by a local Afridi tribesman named Muneer Khan, while the Islamic Taliban was founded by Momin Afridi. The groups later merged and became part of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. Both leaders were killed in a military operation in the area in 2008.

(or Maur), was the first disciple of Saint Benedict of Nursia (512-584). He is mentioned in Saint Gregory the Great's biography of the latter as the first oblate, offered to the monastery by his noble Roman parents as a young boy to be brought up in the monastic life. Four stories involving Maurus recounted by Gregory formed a pattern for the ideal formation of a Benedictine monk. The most famous of these involved Saint Maurus's rescue of Saint Placidus, a younger boy offered to Saint Benedict at the same time as Saint Maurus. The incident has been reproduced in many medieval and Renaissance paintings. Saints Maurus and Placidus are venerated together on 5 October.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ) The Legendary Life of Saint Maurus A long Life of St. Maurus appeared in the late 9th century, supposedly composed by one of Saint Maurus's 6th-century contemporaries. According to this account, the bishop of Le Mans, in western France, sent a delegation asking Benedict for a group of monks to travel from Benedict's new abbey of Monte Cassino to establish monastic life in France according to the Rule of St. Benedict. The Life recounts the long journey of Saint Maurus and his companions from Italy to France, accompanied by many adventures and miracles as Maurus is transformed from the youthful disciple of Benedict into a powerful, miracle-working holy man in his own right. According to this account, after the great pilgrimage to Francia, Saint Maurus founded Glanfeuil Abbey as the first Benedictine monastery in Gaul. It was located on the south bank of the Loire river, a few miles east of Angers. The nave of its thirteenth-century church and some vineyards remain today (according to tradition, the chenin grape was first cultivated at this monastery.) Scholars such as Hippolyte Delehaye believe that this Life of Maurus is a forgery by the late-9th-century abbot of Glanfeuil, Odo.Mershman, Francis. \\"St. Maurus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 12 May 2020 It was composed, as were many such saints' lives in Carolingian France, to popularize local saints' cults. The bones of Saint Maurus were 'discovered' at Glanfeuil by one of Abbot Odo's immediate predecessors, Abbot Gauzlin, in 845. Gauzlin likely invented or at least strongly promoted the cult of Benedict's disciple, taking advantage of Glanfeuil's proximity to two famous and prosperous Benedictine culture centers of the Loire region: the cult of Saint Benedict's bones at Fleury and that of Saint Scholastica's relics at Le Mans. Benedictine tradition alt= Maurus was born c. 510, the son of Equitius, a Roman nobleman. At the age of about twelve, Maurus was entrusted to the care of St. Benedict at Subiaco to be educated. Gregory the Great in the Dialogues recounts a tale wherein the young oblate Placidus was sent to fetch water from the lake and was carried away by the current. Realizing this, Benedict sent Maurus to rescue the boy. Hurrying to reach Placidus, Maurus ran out upon the water. After bringing Placidus back to shore, Maurus attributed the miracle to the prayers of St. Benedict; the abbot, to his disciple's obedience. Maurus was ordained a deacon, and subsequently Benedict, prior to leaving for Monte Cassino, appointed him coadjutor at Subiaco. During his tenure, various miraculous cures were attributed to his prayers. Around 528, Benedict summoned Maurus to join him at Monte Cassino. Around 543, Innocentius, the Bishop of Mans, sent his vicar, Adenard, to Monte Cassino to request Benedict to send some monks to Gaul. Maurus was dispatched and, during the journey, obtained a number of cures for the sick and injured encountered along the way. Through the generosity of King Theudebert, he founded Glanfeuil Abbey, which he governed for many years. He resigned the abbacy in 581 to spend the remainder of his life in solitude and prayer. The abbey of Glanfeuil, was later called St. Maur-sur-Loire. Maurus died at Glanfeuil Abbey 15 January 584. Veneration Maurus was originally buried in the abbey church at Glanfeuil. When, in 868, Odo and the monks of Glanfeuil were obliged to flee to Paris in the face of Vikings marauding along the Loire, the remains of St. Maurus were translated to the abbey of Saint- Pierre-des-Fossés, later renamed Saint-Maur-des-Fossés. In 1750 the relics were relocated to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where they remained until dispersed by a Parisian mob during the French Revolution. Saint Maurus is still venerated by Benedictine congregations today, many monks adopting his name and dedicating monasteries to his patronage. The cult of Saint Maurus slowly spread to monasteries throughout France and by the 11th century had been adopted by Monte Cassino in Italy, along with a revived cult of Saint Placidus. By the late Middle Ages, the cult of Saint Maurus, often associated with that of Saint Placidus, had spread to all Benedictine monasteries. He is the patron of charcoalburners and coppersmiths. The Blessing of Saint Maur is customarily bestowed on the sick with a relic of the true Cross, in hopes of assisting to restore their health. Since it is often impossible to have a relic of the True Cross, in 1959, the Sacred Congregation of Rites granted permission to use the medal of St. Benedict in place of the relic of the True Cross to confer the Blessing. The Congregation of St. Maur took its name from him. The surname \\"Seymour\\" is derived from Saint Maur. =Iconography= In art, he is depicted as a young man in the garb of a monk, usually holding an abbot's cross or sometimes with a spade (an allusion to the monastery of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, literally \\"Saint Maurus of the Ditches\\"). Another of Saint Maurus' attributes is a crutch, in reference to his patronage of cripples. He was invoked especially against fever, and also against rheumatism, epilepsy, and gout. He is also sometimes depicted with a scale, a reference to the implement used to measure a monk's daily ration of bread, given to him by Benedict when he left Montecassino for France. The monks of Fossés near Paris (whence the community of Glanfeuil had fled from the Vikings in 868) exhibited this implement throughout the Middle Ages.

During its first decade of operation, as an independent brewer, Mill Street won several awards including Golden Tap Awards for Best Toronto Microbrewery ('04-'08) and Best Toronto Beer (for Tankhouse Ale: '04-'07), and was named \\"Canadian Brewery of the Year\\" at the Canadian Brewing Awards in 2007, 2008, and 2009. It was purchased in 2015 by Canadian brewer Labatt Brewing Company, which in turn is owned by the global brewing giant Anheuser–Busch InBev. History Rear of the Mill Street Brewery Brew Pub in Toronto The brewery was founded in December 2002 in Toronto by Steve Abrams, Jeff Cooper and Michael Duggan. The brewery was named after its original location at 55 Mill Street in the historic Distillery District, the former industrial complex occupied by spirits maker Gooderham and Worts. In early 2006, all large-scale brewing was moved to a bigger facility in Scarborough, Ontario, and the Distillery District location reopened in October, 2006 as a brewpub. The brewpub features 14 Mill Street beers on draught, including seasonal and other special/one-off releases. In 2007, co-founder Michael Duggan felt the company was diverging from its original vision, and left to start his own brewery. In 2011, the company leased a historic grist mill building adjacent to the Chaudière Falls in Ottawa and converted it into a brewpub. The building is owned by the National Capital Commission and most recently housed The Mill (Old Mill Restaurant), a restaurant that closed in 2007 and a 140-year-old former grist mill. Also in 2011, with the opening of a pub in Terminal 1 of Toronto Pearson International Airport, Mill Street became the first craft brewer to open a bar/restaurant in a major Canadian airport. In Spring 2013, Mill Street expanded their Distillery District operation and added a distillery that distills schnapps from beer. In 2015, Mill Street was purchased by Labatt, which is itself owned by brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev. As part of the purchase agreement, Labatt agreed to invest $10 million into brewing operations to help expand into Quebec. Due to the takeover, the Ontario Craft Brewers no longer considered Mill St. to be an independent craft brewer and removed Mill St. from its membership.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 March 1994. Hebden had previously played the role of Carlos, Mavis Riley's (Thelma Barlow) Spanish lover, in 1974. Norris appeared on a recurring basis, until he was written out in April 1997 by Brian Park. However two years later, the character was reintroduced on a regular basis. Hebden continued to appear on the soap until 2017 after suffering a heart attack. Following his recovery, he has made several guest returns. Storylines Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) is surprised when Norris turns up; the man who gave him a lift home from the motorway service station when he missed the coach from London. He explains he's taken Derek's advice, left his wife and has come to stay. Mavis Wilton (Thelma Barlow) is put out as he keeps calling Derek \\"Dirk\\". Mavis doesn't want to throw Norris out as he might do Derek's morale some good. Derek tells Mavis that he's sure Norris will help him in his career. Norris develops a reputation as a fusspot and a busybody, but his inquisitive nature sometimes works to advantage, as when he guessed that serial killer Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) was after Emily Bishop's (Eileen Derbyshire) money and wanted her dead. Only he and Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) realised Richard's true nature, but no one believed them, and it was not until later that the full story emerged. Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) employs Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) to work at The Kabin, because Norris has back problems but Norris is unhappy about this. Later that month, Emily discovers ladies underwear in a bin bag of Norris's. Instantly suspicious, Tina and Rita confront Norris and ask if he is a transvestite. He explains that he had won the underwear in a competition and that he has an addiction to competitions. Norris' friend, Mary Taylor (Patti Clare), arrives on the Street; Mary was introduced for this specific storyline as she shares Norris' obsession with entering competitions. Norris initially resents Mary, as she often beats him in competitions, but they quickly become close, and Mary offers Norris a ticket she has won for a Cliff Richard concert. Norris' fellow lodger, Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope), enjoys flirting with Mary but she only has eyes for Norris. When Mary and Norris win a motor home, Norris is pleased, but begins to be concerned about how far Mary wants to take their relationship. When Mary's mother dies, she is able to spend more time with Norris, but he remains unsure about their relationship. She then invites him to accompany her on a world cruise, paid for with her inheritance. Norris agrees but is nervous and is shocked by Rita's engagement to Colin Grimshaw (Edward de Souza), and the two share a poignant moment in The Rovers. Genuinely wishing each other well, it is clear that Norris still harbours thoughts of what might have been. He is a great support to Rita when she later calls off the engagement after discovering that Colin fathered a child with a fourteen-year-old girl. Norris' half-brother, Ramsay Clegg (Andrew Sachs), arrives and hopes to make amends with Norris, who refuses to speak to him. Norris blames Ramsay for their mother's death, stating that the shock of his reappearance in her life caused her demise. Despite Ramsay's best efforts at a reconciliation, Norris refuses to see him as anything other than an illegitimate half-brother and Ramsay eventually returns to Australia. Norris is left reeling at the news that Ramsay died on the flight; he had an incurable brain tumour, which he never told Norris about. Some of Ramsay's possessions are left to Norris and amongst them is a letter written by their mother, who cruelly rejected Ramsay. Norris is left devastated that he had blamed Ramsay all along. After Ramsay's death, Rita decides to sell up The Kabin. When Norris receives £172,000 from Ramsay's will, he buys The Kabin from Rita. When Norris shows signs of tiredness, Mary suggests that she does some work in the Kabin so he can take a break. She enters a competition for them to win a week at a cottage in the countryside and wins, persuading Norris to come with her. Norris realises that Mary is trying to ensure that he cannot escape and even hears Mary mention the idea of them getting married; a horrific thought for Norris. She then breaks his glasses, leaving him more or less housebound, as his eyesight is quite poor. He attempts to escape from the cottage but Mary tracks him down. Eventually, he contacts the police telling them that Mary is holding him captive. No charges are brought against her, and Norris subsequently makes up with her. Norris is not pleased when Emily allows Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) and her daughter Amy (Elle Mulvaney) to live with them. When Tracy offers to clean the house for Emily, Norris puts a lock on his bedroom door so that Tracy cannot get into his room. Tracy locks Norris in his room as a joke, and he is annoyed when Amy spills paint on his shoes and tells Emily that he wants Tracy to move out. Emily agrees after Tracy ruins Ernest Bishop's (Stephen Hancock) old dancing shoes, thinking that they belonged to Norris. Norris becomes supportive to Mary after finding out she was raped in her teenage years and conceived a son, whom her mother forced her to give up. Norris and several residents help Mary find her son Jude Appleton (Paddy Wallace), who turns up to visit her. Mary wants to make contact with Jude again, so her and Norris decide to get married and invite Jude and his wife, Angie (Victoria Ekanoye) and their baby son, George (Romeo Cheetham-Karcz), to the wedding. Norris goes through with the marriage to Mary although Jude and Angie find out they only did it to see them, and the pair of them decide to remain. Norris went to visit Emily in Edinburgh following her return from Peru. Norris sold The Kabin to Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) and Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill), to the fury of Rita. On 7 June 2019 after a final drink at the Rovers with his friends Norris left Coronation Street for Scotland with Freda Burgess. As the taxi drives away Norris reminisces about his time on the street and say he will miss it and the people on it. Casting Auditions were held for the part of Norris with actor Malcolm Hebden going on to secure the role. After leaving the series in 1997 Hebden returned to filming with the series in 1999 and has remained on the show to the present day. In 2009 it was noted that the character of Norris has become one of the show's most recognisable characters. Norris was written out along with several other characters as part of a large cast cull in 1997. However, the character was reintroduced two years later in 1999, when he had a more regular role than before. Hebden has said to be surprised by Norris having a fanbase, he said: \\"Norris is a very popular character in general though, and he's also very popular with children, which surprises me. I would have thought he'd get on our nerves, but he doesn't.\\" He went on to say: \\"For some unknown reason, Norris is immensely popular with children, though I never understand why. Is he the granddad they've always wanted to poke fun at? He's always wrong, but most of my letters are from young people, which is lovely. I think they feel safe with him because he's a loser!\\". Development=Mary Taylor= In May 2009, it was announced that Patti Clare, who plays Mary Taylor, had been written out of the soap. A spokesperson for Coronation Street said: \\"The affected actors were all involved in storylines that were due to run for a finite time. If every new character stayed in the show, the Street would be a little crowded to say the least.\\" It was then rumored that Clare would be returning; Hebden revealed these rumors were true. Hebden praised Mary and Norris, he said: \\"I think when Patti and I get together it's comedy all the way. We love working together which is a good start for comedy. Oddly enough, you can play a love relationship with someone you hate - I've done it - but comedy you can't do. So I love her to death and it helps with the comedy.\\" Hebden also revealed that Mary should stay in the soap for good. In September 2009, it was announced Clare was to reprise her role as Mary. A spokesperson confirmed: \\"Mary will be back to rekindle her relationship with Norris.\\" On 18 February 2010, it was announced that Norris would be held captive by Mary in a Misery- style storyline, speaking of the storyline a Coronation Street source told The Mirror: \\"Mary convinces herself they are reincarnations of Heathcliffe and Cathy and keeps trying to share his bed. Norris escapes to a phone box. When Mary arrives he tries to run and hide but falls and sprains his ankle. Mary refuses to take him to hospital and returns him to the cottage telling him, 'The more helpless you are the stronger I get'. =Ramsay Clegg= Andrew Sachs (pictured) was cast in the role of Ramsay Clegg. On 5 January 2009, it was announced that former Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs had been cast in Coronation Street to play Norris's half-brother, Ramsay Clegg. Sachs said that he had foreseen playing Ramsay five years before: \\"Myself and my wife had dreamt up a storyline where I played Norris's brother. We thought it would be great fun if a brother every bit as annoying as Norris turned up and the pair of them wound everyone up.\\" Sachs also said that he nearly turned down the role \\"because I was too scared. I said to my wife that I didn't think I could do it. Apparently there is very little rehearsal time and I said I wasn't sure I liked the part anyway.\\" Asked by Digital Spy \\"What's it been like working with Andrew Sachs for the past few months?\\", Malcolm Hebden replied: \\"\\"It was suggested two or three years ago that Andrew Sachs wanted to be my brother and because we had a change of perhaps two producers in that time, it just got lost in the hundreds of storylines we have. I was talking to our new producer Kim Crowther and said I thought it was a great shame we'd never picked up the Andrew Sachs stuff and she knew nothing of it. She thought it was a great idea and she made it happen. Andrew was very happy to do it.\\" He also went on to say: \\"I had met Andrew once before and he expressed how keen he was to do it. We got on terribly well. I think it took him a little while to get used to my sense of humour but he did by the time he left! For me, the storyline kicks in once he's dead - that sounds awful - but I was just being dismissive and blocking Ramsay for the first part of the story. I just didn't want anything to do with him. Then Ramsay goes back to Australia and dies on the aeroplane but the fallout is enormous - not just for Norris, but particularly for Emily. She'd become quite fond of Ramsay. He's a civilised man and quite a charming character, whereas Norris isn't. Therefore, I'm going to be terribly unpopular for a little while until Norris realises that he was wrong.\\" =Temporary departure and guest returns= On 23 January 2018, it was reported that Hebden would not be seen onscreen for a short period after last appearing on screen in early December 2017. On 5 July 2018, Hebden revealed that he was recovering from a heart attack and had spent most of the previous December in an induced coma. In October 2018, while appearing on This Morning, Patti Clare who plays Mary Taylor teased a possible return for Norris the following year. On 26 November 2018, Coronation Street officially confirmed Hebden's return as Norris, although Hebden won't be back on screen until May 2019, the ITV soap told Digital Spy that everyone is looking forward to his return. His return was described as being like a cameo, and the character will leave again, although the role will be left open for the actor to return. Hebden departed on 7 June 2019 but returned again for Ken Barlow's (William Roache) 80th birthday celebrations on 9 October 2019. Norris returned briefly two months later during the episode that aired on 9 December 2019, and in 2020, he returned for a few stints before departing 24 June. In other media A trailer for promotion of the Coronation Street website on ITV, which was released in July 2009 to air on television, portrays Norris as James Bond, using high-tech devices to spy on many of his neighbours, in reference to his character's curiosity to know everyone's business in the street. Reception Malcolm Hebden was nominated for \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" for his portrayal of Norris at The British Soap Awards 2002. Hebden was also nominated for \\"Funniest Performance\\" at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards.

It is located on the Gloucester-Newport line. The station is located a mile south of Lydney, and was originally called Lydney Junction, which is now the name of the nearby station on the preserved Dean Forest Railway. History A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Lydney Lydney Junction was the name of two separate but adjacent stations on two different railway lines. The Great Western Railway station, which is the one that remains open as Lydney railway station, opened in 1851 on the Gloucester to Chepstow section of the South Wales Railway. To the west of this station, the freight-only line of the Severn and Wye Mineral Railway crossed the GWR line on its north-south route taking coal and iron from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Lydney. In 1875, the Severn and Wye started passenger services and built a new terminus station at Lydney Junction for passenger trains to and from Drybrook, near Cinderford. Four years later, this first station was superseded by a new one as the Severn and Wye joined with the Midland Railway in building the Severn Bridge Railway, which linked Lydney across the River Severn with the Midland's Sharpness Branch Line, enabling access for the Forest of Dean minerals to the new and more extensive docks at Sharpness. The new Lydney Junction (Severn and Wye) station was linked by a long footbridge to the GWR's station. There were also extensive freight yards in the north-east quadrant between the two lines, and these provided the only rail link between the Severn and Wye and the Great Western lines. The two stations worked closely together, particularly after 1894, when the Severn and Wye Railway was bought by the Great Western and the Midland. Finally, in 1955, under British Railways, the two stations were formally merged into one. Lydney Junction (Severn and Wye) was used as a through- station for passenger services to and from Berkeley Road railway station and over the Severn Railway Bridge. These services either terminated at Lydney Town railway station, which was in the centre of Lydney, or continued on northwards into the Forest of Dean to terminate at Lydbrook Junction on the Ross to Monmouth line. These services ceased abruptly in October 1960 when the Severn Railway Bridge was damaged beyond economic repair in a shipping accident. Passenger services were officially withdrawn from this Lydney Junction in November 1964 and it remained closed until reopening by the Dean Forest Railway in 1995. The other Lydney Junction, then renamed Lydney, lost its freight services in 1968 and its staffing in 1969, and the Great Western buildings on the platforms were demolished, though the signalbox remained until December 2012. Facilities The station is unstaffed, but a self- service ticket machine is provided (this can also be used for collecting advance purchase tickets). Train running information is provided by customer help points, digital CIS displays and timetable posters on each platform (along with waiting shelters). Step-free access is offered to both sides via the level crossing.Lydney station facilities National Rail Enquiries  Services  Transport for Wales provide an hourly service each way between and via . In 2010, Arriva Trains Wales Sprinter DMU 150245 calls with a service for Maesteg. The majority of passenger services at Lydney are provided by Transport for Wales, with an hourly -- service in each direction (although there are a couple of gaps during the middle of the day). On Sundays, there is a two-hourly service each way. CrossCountry also serve the station as part of their Cardiff Central to via Birmingham New Street route. Monday to Saturday, there are six trains per day in each direction. There is no Sunday service on this route. There is no footbridge at the station, and therefore no means of crossing the line to get to the opposing platform once the level crossing gates close in advance of a train arriving. Incidents An incident occurred at the station's level crossing on 23 March 2011 when a fault with the automatic barriers caused a northbound CrossCountry service to pass over the crossing at while the gates were raised (although the traffic lights were red).

She was introduced as the best friend of Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). She made her first appearance during the episode airing on 5 November 1999. Storylines Candice first appeared as Sarah Platt's (Tina O'Brien) best friend from school. Candice was one of the first people Sarah told of her pregnancy. While many of Sarah's friends turned against her, Candice stuck by her throughout the pregnancy and birth of her daughter Bethany. She was Bethany's godmother. Her mother did not approve of Sarah when she became pregnant and called her a bad influence on her daughter, but it was later revealed that Candice was the bad influence on Sarah. Candice and her mother's relationship broke down when Candice's mother would not believe that she was being sexually harassed by her mother's boyfriend. Sarah's grandmother, Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), soon took pity on Candice and she moved into the salon flat. Candice then went on to work as a trainee hairdresser in Audrey's salon. Candice dated Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), but he broke up with her after discovering that she had slept with Jason (Ryan Thomas), his older half brother. When promising footballer Warren Baldwin (Danny Young) arrived in Weatherfield she dreamed of fame and soon got together with him. But he later ended their relationship when he left to play for a Spanish team. Candice also dated Darren Michaels (Nicholas Zabel) and Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson), but later dumped him via text message as she left the street when Status Quo offered her a job as a stylist. Development In June 2005, it was reported that Sanderson had quit her role as Candice. \\"I have had the most fantastic and memorable time here at Corrie,\\" Sanderson said. She went on to say: \\"I made the decision to leave as it is time for me and Candice to leave the cobbles on a high. I am really sad to be going because I will miss everybody. I am excited about what the future holds and I'd like to thank everybody for the fantastic opportunities I have been given.\\" Coronation Street producer Tony Wood said: \\"Candice is a character with a great deal of ambition and we felt it was not believable that she would stay in Weatherfield forever. At the same time Nikki has indicated that she wants to try her hand at other projects - it therefore suits Coronation Street and Nikki for the character to be written out this autumn. Nikki has been a real asset to the show and the writers have had great fun writing for Candice. We wish her all the best for the future.\\" Following her departure The People claimed that Sanderson quit her role after becoming tired of being sidelined by the show's producers. She apparently felt that the soap's scriptwriters favoured her fellow cast-members Tina O'Brien (Sarah Platt) and Samia Ghadie (Maria Sutherland). The newspaper claimed that Sanderson told former boyfriend Jamie Meakin about her frustrations. \\"The whole thing about Nikki leaving Corrie for love and a singing career is really only half the truth and bit of a smoke screen,\\" Meakin revealed. \\"She would say, 'I'm just as good as anyone else' and get all upset. To be honest, Nikki was jealous of the attention Tina and Samia got all the time.\\" Sanderson later denied the rumours, explaining, \\"I've never felt sidelined by anyone. You only have to watch the show to see that I've had some fantastic storylines which I have thoroughly enjoyed. The only person who knows the real reasons why I'm leaving the show is me. I knew there would be speculation but to say things that aren't true hurts.\\" In November 2011, the Daily Star revealed that Coronation Street producer Phil Collinson was planning on bringing back Sanderson and Tina O'Brien who played Sarah Platt between 1999 and 2007 in a bid to fill the gap left by the departures of Helen Flanagan who played Rosie Webster and Katherine Kelly who played Becky McDonald. A source told the paper: \\"He's aware that Sarah and Candice were hugely popular characters. He thinks it would be a ratings winner to bring them back. Losing Katherine and Helen is a big blow to the show so Phil wants to beef things up a bit with the return of a couple of big names.\\" In May 2013, Sanderson who has since joined Hollyoaks playing the role of Maxine Minniver revealed that she has never considered reprising her role as Candice. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Sanderson said: \\"I've never even thought about going back to Corrie – I left seven years ago. I've done so many other things in that time. That's why it doesn't even feel like a crossover going into Hollyoaks, I've had a complete career between the two soaps.\\" She continued: \\"Corrie was my first main job and I loved it, I loved being challenged. When I left Corrie I went on to a job where we were filming four or five scenes a day. I couldn't believe it, I was used to filming 16 scenes a day! I'd just assumed all TV work was like that.\\" Following O'Brien's return as Sarah in 2015, Sanderson said to The Sun: \\"Tina's back on the cobbles, bless her. Could they tempt me back to the cobbles? No, I am loving it where I am at the moment.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Female characters in television Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Candice Stowe"},{"id":"2275615","text":"The Pope's throne in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, last publicly exposed in 1867. (From Wood Carvings in English Churches, 1910) The Chair of Saint Peter (), also known as the Throne of Saint Peter, is a relic conserved in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, the sovereign enclave of the Pope inside Rome, Italy. The relic is a wooden throne that tradition claims the Apostle Saint Peter, the leader of the Early Christians in Rome and first Pope, used as Bishop of Rome. The relic is enclosed in a sculpted gilt bronze casing designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and executed between 1647 and 1653. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI described the chair as \\"a symbol of the special mission of Peter and his Successors to tend Christ’s flock, keeping it united in faith and in charity.\\" The wooden throne was a gift from Holy Roman Emperor Charles the Bald to Pope John VIII in 875. It has been studied many times over the years, the last being from 1968 to 1974, when it was last removed from the Bernini altar. That study concluded that it was not a double, but rather a single, chair with a covering and that no part of the chair dated earlier than the sixth century.  Description  The relic itself is described as an oaken chair damaged by cuts and worms. The Chair has metal rings attached to each side, allowing use as a sedia gestatoria. The back and front of the chair are trimmed with carved ivory. This description comes from 1867, when the relic was photographed and displayed for veneration. The reliquary, like many of the medieval period, takes the form of the relic it protects, i.e. the form of a chair. Symbolically, the chair Bernini designed had no earthly counterpart in actual contemporary furnishings. It is formed entirely of scrolling members, enclosing a coved panel where the upholstery pattern is rendered as a low relief of Christ instructing Peter to tend to His sheep.John 21:17 Large angelic figures flank an openwork panel beneath a highly realistic bronze seat cushion, vividly empty: the relic is encased within.In late seventeenth- century Venice, Andrea Brustolon constructed a few grandiose armchairs that employ similar sculptural figures doing duty as front legs and armrest supports. The cathedra is lofted on splayed scrolling bars that appear to be effortlessly supported by four over-lifesize bronze Doctors of the Church: Western doctors Saint Ambrose and Saint Augustine of Hippo on the outsides, wearing miters, and Eastern doctors Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Athanasius on the insides, both bare-headed. The cathedra appears to hover over the altar in the basilica's apse, lit by a central tinted window through which light streams, illuminating the gilded glory of sunrays and sculpted clouds that surrounds the window. Like Bernini's Ecstasy of Saint Theresa, this is a definitive fusionSee Gesamtkunstwerk of the Baroque arts, unifying sculpture and richly polychrome architecture and manipulating effects of light. Above, on the golden background of the frieze, is the Latin inscription: \\"O Pastor Ecclesiae, tu omnes Christi pascis agnos et oves\\" (O Shepherd of the Church, you feed all Christ's lambs and sheep). On the right is the same writing in Greek. Behind the altar is placed Bernini's monument enclosing the wooden chair, both of which are seen as symbolic of the authority of the Bishop of Rome as Vicar of Christ and successor of Saint Peter. Feast of the Chair of Saint Peter Early martyrologies indicate that two liturgical feasts were celebrated in Rome, centuries before the time of Charles the Bald, in honour of earlier chairs associated with Saint Peter, one of which was kept in the baptismal chapel of St. Peter's Basilica, the other at the catacomb of Priscilla. The dates of these celebrations were January 18 and February 22. No surviving chair has been identified with either of these chairs. The feasts thus became associated with an abstract understanding of the \\"Chair of Peter\\", which by synecdoche signifies the episcopal office of the Pope as Bishop of Rome, an office considered to have been first held by Saint Peter, and thus extended to the diocese, the See of Rome. Though both feasts were originally associated with Saint Peter's stay in Rome, the ninth-century form of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum associated the January 18 feast with his stay in Rome, and the February 22 feast with his stay at Antioch. The two feasts were included in the Tridentine Calendar with the rank of Double, which Pope Clement VIII raised in 1604 to the newly invented rank of Greater Double. In 1960 Pope John XXIII removed from the General Roman Calendar the January 18 feast of the Chair of Peter, along with seven other feast days that were second feasts of a single saint or mystery.Variationes in Breviario et Missali Romano ad normam novi Codicis Rubricarum, I — Variationes in calendario, 8. The February 22 celebration became a Second-Class Feast. This calendar was incorporated in the 1962 Roman Missal of Pope John XXIII, whose continued use Pope Benedict XVI authorized under the conditions indicated in his motu proprio Summorum Pontificum. Those Catholics who follow the pre-1962 calendar continue to celebrate both feast days: \\"Saint Peter's Chair at Rome\\" on January 18 and the \\"Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch\\" on February 22. In the new classification introduced in 1969 the February 22 celebration appears in the Roman Calendar with the rank of Feast.

The southern portion of the cave requires you to crawl through a trench dug out of the clay floor of the cave leading to a small space approximately long by wide by high in which you can turn around to return to the main cavern. It is called Kuna Caves despite being only a single cave system. Though according to locals, at one time the system had been much larger and was composed of multiple caves—even stretching to the Snake River--before the Army Corps of Engineers blocked it off by detonating dynamite collapsing a portion of the cave. A logbook was placed deep in the North end of the cave for people to sign in 2018. Although the entrance has a ladder to get down into the cavern, it is not maintained. The short road leading to the cave is unmaintained, often very muddy, and the cave itself is littered with trash and graffiti. The interior temperature of the cave hovers around year round.

Located east of downtown, it contains numerous cafés, restaurants, and shops housed within heritage buildings of the former Gooderham and Worts Distillery. The district comprises more than forty heritage buildings and ten streets, and is the largest collection of Victorian-era industrial architecture in North America. The district was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988.Gooderham and Worts Distillery, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaGooderham and Worts Distillery , National Register of Historic Places History The Gooderham and Worts Distillery was founded in 1832. Once providing over of whisky, mostly for export on the world market, the company was bought out in later years by rival Hiram Walker Co., another large Canadian distiller. Its location on the side of the Canadian National Railway mainline and its proximity to the mouth of the original route of the Don River outlet into Lake Ontario created a hard edge which separated the district from neighbouring communities. These did, however, allow for a facilitated transport connection to the rest of Canada and the world and acted as Toronto's domination as an industrial centre or transshipping hub. The Distillery District was home to the Gooderham and Worts distillery in the 1860s. With the deindustrialization of the surrounding area in the late 20th century, and the winding-down of the distillery operations, the district was left increasingly derelict. Surrounding industrial and commercial buildings and structures were often demolished, leaving the former distillery surrounded primarily by empty lots. Nonetheless, the closing of the remaining distillery operations in 1990 created redevelopment and investment opportunities for a district that contained the largest and best preserved collection of Victorian-era industrial architecture in North America. The Distillery District was designated as a National Historic Site, and has been protected under the Ontario Heritage Act since 1976. It was listed by National Geographic magazine as a \\"top pick\\" in Canada for travellers. The economic recession of the early 1990s, however, and the resulting crash in residential condominium prices and office lease rates in downtown Toronto, delayed efforts to revitalize the district. Nonetheless, two residential condominium buildings were constructed on the periphery of the district during the late 1990s. While the site awaited redevelopment and reinvestment, the district's ambiance began to attract numerous film shoots. Since 1990, the site has served as a location for over 800 film and television productions.list =21st century= In 2001, the neighbourhood was made into a pedestrian-oriented area. In 2001, the site was purchased by Cityscape Holdings Inc., which transformed the district into a pedestrian-orientated area.Kevin A. Lynch, Kevin Lynch Work was completed and the district reopened to the public by 2003. The new owners refused to lease any of the retail and restaurant space to chains or franchises, and accordingly, the majority of the buildings are occupied with boutiques, art galleries, restaurants, jewellery stores, cafés, and coffeehouses, including a well-known microbrewery, the Mill Street Brewery. The upper floors of a number of buildings have been leased to artists as studio spaces and to office tenants with a \\"creative focus\\". A new theatre, the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, has opened on the site and serves as the home of the Soulpepper Theatre Company and the George Brown Theatre School. There are plans to develop residential condominiums, offices, and more retail space on the vacant lands that surround the district. New condominium developments will be located at the south-east corner of the neighbourhood, bordering on Cherry Street and Tank House Lane.Building for the Future , National Post The Pan American Games' Athletes' Village was built in the area in 2015, in conjunction with an extension to the streetcar network constructed along Cherry Street. After the games, the athletes village was converted to townhouses, condos, affordable housing, and retail space. = Toronto Christmas Market = The Toronto Christmas Market is an annual outdoor tradition run within the Distillery District, and for last year it was open from November 15 - December 23, 2018. It is turned into a magical 'town-like' area covered with twinkly lights, ribbon, and in the center of the market is a 54 ft Christmas tree. The market includes \\"Santa's house\\", an Indigo pop-up shop, pet photos with Santa, a Ferris wheel and themed entertainment each day (e.g. Friday night jazz). There are also multiple food vendors and dining locations that are popular tourist attractions such as French Canadian Poutine, the Gingerbread House, Maple Leaf Fudge, Mill Street Brewery, and more. In 2017, Canadian singer Shawn Mendes and American model Hailey Baldwin attended the Toronto Christmas Market. The 2020 edition of the event was cancelled due to the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Urban design Motor vehicle traffic is restricted to the outer areas of the Distillery District, with most of the neighbourhood designated as a pedestrian zone. The Distillery District's traditional brick-paved streets and lanes are restricted to pedestrians and cyclists, with general motor vehicle traffic restricted to streets and parking areas outside of the district's historic centre. Several large sculptures installed along the lanes enliven its streetscapes, three being on Distillery Lane and the final one at the parking area at the end of Trinity Street. Another primary landmark is the chimney stack atop the Boiler House complex. There are informal public spaces on the pedestrianized streets with chairs and tables for general use, as well as formal patios for some of its coffee houses and restaurants. Trinity Street is the widest street in the district and often functions as a public square for events such as market days. The main thoroughfares within the district are Distillery Lane from Parliament Street running southeast to Trinity Street, Trinity Street from Mill Street at its north end to the motor vehicle parking area at its south end, and Tank House Lane from Trinity Street east to Cherry Street. The four borders of the Distillery District are Parliament Street to the west, Mill Street to the north, Cherry Street to the east, and the parking area to the south with the condominiums along Distillery Lane forming hard edges to pedestrians. Trinity Street is the Distillery District's widest street and serves as a public square for the community. The Distillery District can be reached via the Toronto Transit Commission's 121 Fort York-Esplanade bus route, and since June 2016 the 514 Cherry streetcar line has its eastern terminus at the Distillery Loop to the east of the historic district, providing service along King Street through the downtown core as far west as Dufferin Gate Loop in Liberty Village. The surrounding lands are animated with a mix of uses: residential areas at Parliament and Distillery and at the eastern end of Mill Street up to Cherry, restaurants along Trinity Street, Tank House Lane, Brewery Lane, and Case Goods Lane, and education uses at the eastern end of Tank House Lane.Distillery Site Plan The Historic Distillery District =Government policy= Toronto's Official Plan designates the Distillery District as a mixed-use land parcel, which is an area that includes a combination of land uses such as commercial, residential, entertainment facilities and art galleries. In order to provide additional details regarding the breakdown of the types of mixed uses in the area, the King-Parliament Secondary Plan is used to determine the locations of the commercial, residential, and other land uses. The Distillery District is a historic district that sees land use for residential, commercial, and entertainment purposes. In addition, the plan also outlines design guidelines and places emphasis on enhancing the existing historical buildings. The plan divides the 13 acre area into three different mixed-use designations. This includes the incorporation of a bike lane and private roadway where the current southern park lot is located. The remaining existing structures within the District all comply with the outlined land uses within the Secondary Plan.King-Parliament Secondary Plan In addition, the Ontario Heritage Act 1990 is a governing document for the historical buildings that have been redeveloped on the site. Any amendments to this act must be proposed to the Conservation Review Board for approval.Ontario Heritage Act In particular, the Secondary Plan reinforces these notions by stating that any additions to existing buildings within mixed use areas 2 and 3 \\"may be permitted only if it has been demonstrated that they respect the three-dimensional integrity of the heritage building, and the quality and the character of both the historic building being added to and its relationship to adjacent historical buildings within the area\\". The Secondary Plan is important for guiding how development occurs within the area. It provides the course of action for what the future image of the Distillery should look like and ensures that development at a small scale (such as the 13 acre area of the Distillery) is compliant with plans outlined in the City's master plan (official plan) and is reflective of the province's Planning Act (1990), which sets out the ground rules for land use planning.The Planning Act Various buildings on the site are protected under part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since 1976. The property at 70 Mill Street is protected under a heritage easement since April 3, 1996. Buildings The Stone Distillery (left) next to the Boiler House (centre-right). The Malt House, or the Maltings building. The Cooperage is visible in the background. The former distillery consisted of a series of buildings, centred around a seven-storey windmill and wharf.

Most households contain one to two persons and the area has a lack of single detached housing. The immigrant population of the area is largely made up of persons of European descent with the overwhelming majority of the population not being visible minorities. The occupation data for the neighbourhood shows that almost a fifth of the residents work in social science/education/government service/religion. Those with jobs in sales and service, business, and arts/ culture/ recreation and sports make up a total of 48% of the occupation categories with an even split of 16% to each job category.CHASS - City of Toronto, Dissemination area 3175 StatsCan See also *Gooderham Building, offices for the Gooderham & Worts distillery in Toronto's St. Lawrence neighbourhood *List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto References ;Bibliography * ;Notes External links *Distillery District website *Distillery Heritage website Category:Neighbourhoods in Toronto Category:Warehouse districts Category:Warehouses in Canada Category:Historic districts in Canada Category:Economy of Toronto Category:National Historic Sites in Ontario Category:Restaurant districts and streets in Canada Category:Distilleries in Canada Category:Tourist attractions in Toronto Category:City of Toronto Heritage Properties Category:Pedestrian malls in Canada Category:Entertainment districts in Canada Category:Adaptive reuse of industrial structures in Canada ","title":"Distillery District"},{"id":"2275647","text":"Saint Prisca was a young Roman woman allegedly tortured and executed for her Christian faith.

Legend  Legend says that Saint Prisca was of a noble family. At age thirteen, she was accused of Christianity before Emperor Claudius. He ordered her to make a sacrifice to the god Apollo. When she refused because of her Christian faith, she was beaten and sent to prison. Upon her release from prison, she still held steadfastly to her faith in Jesus Christ. This time her punishment included flogging, the pouring of boiling tallow upon her, and a second imprisonment. She was at last thrown to a lion in the amphitheater, but it quietly lay down at her feet. She was starved for three days in a slaves' prison house, and then tortured upon the rack. Pieces of flesh were next torn from her body with iron hooks, and she was thrown on a burning pile.Brown, Abbie Farwell. \\"Saint Prisca, the Child Martyr.\\" Baldwin Online Children's Project.

The Christians buried her body in a catacomb at the place of her death, where now stands a church of St. Prisca and where previously stood a very early title church, the Titulus Priscoe, mentioned in the fifth century and likely built in the fourth.

BNP believes in more provincial rights and greater autonomy for Baluchistan province through peaceful and democratic struggle.  History  In 1972, the National Awami Party or NAP formed the first elected government in Balochistan after winning the elections and Ataullah Mengal was sworn in as the first Chief Minister of Balochistan. But just nine months after the formation of the NAP Government, it was overthrown by Bhutto who used Nawab Akbar Bugti's allegation that Mengal's regime wanted to disintegrate Pakistan and liberate Balochistan as grounds for this dismissal. Ataullah Mengal, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Gul Khan Nasir, Nawab Khair Bux Marri and the other NAP leaders were thrown in jail. They were released when Bhutto's government was toppled by Zia-ul-Haq, after spending more than four years in captivity. By this time differences had arisen between the NAP leadership, so while Mengal, Bizenjo and Nasir went to the NAP headquarters, Khair Bux and Shero Marri headed home. Later, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo formed the Pakistan National Party or PNP after differences arose between him and Wali Khan over the Kabul Revolution (he supported the revolution while Wali Khan was against it). Gul Khan joined PNP and became the President of its Balochistan wing while Ataullah went into exile in London. In 1996, Ataullah Mengal returned to Pakistan and formed the Balochistan National Party.  BNP Government  BNP swept the 1997 elections and was able to form a coalition government in Balochistan with Sardar Ataullah Mengal's son, Akhtar Mengal as the Chief Minister. This government did not last long as, soon, differences began arising between the Balochistan Provincial Government and the Federal Government.  1998–2009  After the dismissal of their first government, BNP hasn't taken part in any elections. In 2002, the party didn't compete in the elections in protest of General Pervez Musharraf's October 1999 military coup which allowed the pro-military religious alliance to win almost all the moderate and nationalist constituencies. Though a few members of the party did take part in the elections independently. One of these members got elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan, one to the Senate of Pakistan and two to the Provincial Assembly i.e. Mir Akbar Mengal and Mir Akhtar Hussain Langove. In 2006, Nawab Akbar Bugti was killed by the Pakistani Army. BNP had vehemently criticized the government when the operation in Balochistan had been launched and after Bugti's death all four of its independently elected representatives resigned from their seats of the National and Provincial Assemblies. In December 2006 Akhtar Mengal was arrested for allegedly ordering his security guards to beat up secret service personnel. Mengal maintained that these secret service officials had tried to kidnap his children as they returned from school and as a result, the security guards had beaten them. During his trial, according to Mr Iqbal Haider, secretary-general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, \\"Mr Mengal was brought into the courtroom and shoved into an iron cage with bars all around that stood in a corner away from his counsel.” Mengal was released in 2008, after the Pakistan Peoples Party government came in power, after spending almost one and a half year in jail. After Akhtar Mengal's arrest, the rest of the BNP leadership was also imprisoned mainly in MPO cases. On December 2, Sajid Tareen was arrested from his chambers, Habib Jalib Baloch, Mir Akhtar Hussain Langove and Akbar Mengal were also arrested the same day. Jahanzeb Jamaldini was also put under arrest in December. Then, on January 3, 2007 the acting Chief of BNP, Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was also arrested along with other activists while they were on their way to meet imprisoned workers of BNP in Khuzdar.  Platform  The Balochistan National Party's main goal has been for the provinces having control over their resources. Under the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan, the federal government has broad powers, though the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan brought some changes.  Council Session 2009  Balochistan National Party's third council session was held between 25 and 28 June 2009. It was presided over by an ailment stricken Akhtar Mengal.

She received a \\"negligible\\" private education up to the age of 16, when she decided to take up a job at the War Office. During the Second World War, she volunteered to work on the canals as a boatswoman. Later on, her experiences as a trainee boatswoman on the Grand Union Canal would become the basis for her debut novel, Maidens' Trip. In September 1946, Smith, still only 23, went off to India with a team of documentary film-makers that included the poet Laurie Lee, who served as the scriptwriter on the team. During the trip, Cider with Rosie, Lee's classic account of growing up in rural Gloucestershire, was in its embryonic stages. Emma Smith was one of those who would later encourage Lee to complete what became one of the best loved accounts of childhood in English literature. After nine months in India, Smith returned to England in 1947 and set down to write her first book. Maidens' Trip (1948) proved to be a critical and a commercial success and won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. With the proceeds from it, she moved to Paris, where she took a room in the Hotel de Tournon and, drawing on her memories of India, typed up her second novel. It was reprinted by Bloomsbury in 2011.. It was while working on her second novel in Paris in 1948 that Smith was photographed with her typewriter on the quay at the Ile de la Cité by the French street photographer Robert Doisneau, who was commissioned by Paris Match. After appearing in the magazine, Doisneau continued to use the photograph in his collections.Day, Elizabeth (18 Aug 2013). Emma Smith: 'I'd swap all my books for my children'.

The tale of a young English girl and her cantankerous father travelling together through India, it was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1949, and later reissued in a Penguin edition. Later life In 1951, Smith married, and within six years became the mother of two children, then suddenly a widow. She then moved to Radnorshire in rural Wales to raise her children. Her writing took a back seat to her family duties. Only very slowly did she return to writing. She produced several children's books, as well as a novel, The Opportunity of a Lifetime, in 1978. But she never regained the celebrity she had enjoyed in the late 1940s. The specialist canal book publisher M. & M. Baldwin pioneered the revival of interest in Emma Smith's work, by republishing her award-winning Maidens' Trip in 1987 and keeping it in print for many years. The novelist Susan Hill has been instrumental in a recent revival of interest in Emma Smith's works. Many years after The Far Cry had gone out of print, Hill found a copy in a jumble sale and wrote enthusiastically of her discovery in the Daily Telegraph. In 2002 – 50 years after the Penguin edition – Persephone Books reprinted The Far Cry as one of a series of forgotten classics by women writers. Hill supplied the afterword to that edition. After 1980, Emma Smith lived in Putney in south- west London. In 2008, Smith returned to writing with a memoir, The Great Western Beach, describing her childhood in Cornwall between the two World Wars. Bloomsbury Publishing, its publishers, went on to republish Maidens' Trip in 2009. The success of her first memoir led Bloomsbury Publishing to encouraged her to write a sequel. This appeared as As Green As Grass in 2013, and covered her life between 1935, when she left Newquay at the age of 12, to 1951 when she married.

One of only sixty-three extant cellos attributed to Stradivari, it was crafted from exceptional wood reserved by the luthier for large instruments. Its varnish has been described as \\"unusually rich\\" and the color a reddish-orange with golden transparency. The cello takes its name from the nineteenth-century Belgian cellist, Adrien Francois Servais (1807–1866), who played this cello. The Servais Stradivarius is currently owned by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. The instrument is famous for its remarkable state of preservation—retaining its original 1701 label—and musical excellence. The Russian Prince Yusupov purchased the cello for Servais ca. 1845, and it was subsequently passed to his son. The cello was later donated to the Smithsonian by Charlotte Bergen of New Jersey.

Adjustable gastric band surgery is an example of bariatric surgery designed for obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater—or between 35 and 40 in cases of patients with certain comorbidities that are known to improve with weight loss, such as sleep apnea, diabetes, osteoarthritis, GERD, hypertension (high blood pressure), or metabolic syndrome, among others. In February 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded approval of adjustable gastric bands to patients with a BMI between 30 and 40 and one weight-related medical condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. However, an adjustable gastric band may be used only after other methods such as diet and exercise have been tried. Working principle Illustration of adjustable gastric banding The inflatable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch. This slows and limits the amount of food that can be consumed at one time, thus giving the opportunity for the sense of satiety to be met with the release of peptide YY (PYY). It does not decrease gastric emptying time. The individual achieves sustained weight loss by choosing healthy food options, limiting food intake and volume, reducing appetite, and progress of food from the top portion of the stomach to the lower portion digestion. According to the American Society for Metabolic Bariatric Surgery, bariatric surgery is not an easy option for obesity sufferers. It is a drastic step, and carries the usual pain and risks of any major gastrointestinal surgical operation. However, gastric banding is the least invasive surgery of its kind and is completely reversible, with another \\"keyhole\\" operation. Gastric banding is performed using laparoscopic surgery and usually results in a shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, smaller scars, and less pain than open surgical procedures. Because no part of the stomach is stapled or removed, and the patient's intestines are not re-routed, he or she can continue to absorb nutrients from food normally. Gastric bands are made entirely of biocompatible materials, so they are able to stay in the patient's body without causing harm. However, not all patients are suitable for laparoscopy. Patients who are extremely obese, who have had previous abdominal surgery, or have complicating medical problems may require the open approach.Bariatric Surgery for Severe Obesity, National Institutes of Health. 2009;08-4006. Retrieved 2010-07-30. =Placement via laparoscopic surgery= The surgical insertion of an adjustable gastric band is often referred to as a lap band procedure or band placement. First, a small incision (typically less than 1.25 cm or 0.5 in.) is made near the belly button. Carbon dioxide (a gas that occurs naturally in the body) is introduced into the abdomen to create a work space for the surgeon. Then a small laparoscopic camera is placed through the incision into the abdomen. The camera sends a picture of the stomach and abdominal cavity to a video monitor. It gives the surgeon a good view of the key structures in the abdominal cavity. A few additional small incisions are made in the abdomen. The surgeon watches the video monitor and works through these small incisions using instruments with long handles to complete the procedure. The surgeon creates a small, circular tunnel behind the stomach, inserts the gastric band through the tunnel, and locks the band around the stomach. Clinical studies of laparoscopic (minimally invasive) bariatric surgery patients found that they felt better, spent more time doing recreational and physical activities, benefited from enhanced productivity and economic opportunities, and had more self-confidence than they did prior to surgery. =Mechanics= The placement of the band creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. This pouch holds approximately ½ cup of food, whereas the typical stomach holds about 6 cups of food. The pouch fills with food quickly, and the band slows the passage of food from the pouch to the lower part of the stomach.Lee C, Zieve, D. Laparoscopic gastric banding. National Institutes of Health. Retrieved 2010-07-08. As the upper part of the stomach registers as full, the message to the brain is that the entire stomach is full, and this sensation helps the person to be hungry less often, feel full more quickly and for a longer period of time, eat smaller portions, and lose weight over time. As patients lose weight, their bands will need adjustments, or \\"fills\\", to ensure comfort and effectiveness. The gastric band is adjusted by introducing a saline solution into a small access port placed just under the skin. A specialized non-coring needle is used to avoid damage to the port membrane and prevent leakage.Surgical Procedures & Innovations: Gastric Bandings Columbia University, Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery; New York, NY: 2007. Retrieved 2010-07-09. There are many port designs (such as high profile and low profile), and they may be placed in varying positions based on the surgeon's preference, but are always attached (through sutures, staples, or another method) to the muscle wall in and around the diaphragm. Adjustable gastric bands hold between 4 and 12 cc of saline solution, depending on their design. When the band is inflated with saline solution, it places pressure around the outside of the stomach. This decreases the size of the passage between the pouch created from the upper part of the stomach and the lower stomach and further restricts the movement of food. Over the course of several visits to the doctor, the band is filled until the optimal restriction has been achieved – neither so loose that hunger is not controlled, nor so tight that food cannot move through the digestive system. The number of adjustments required is an individual experience and cannot be accurately predicted. =Types of adjustable bands= Realize and Lap-Band In the U.S. market, two types of adjustable gastric bands have been approved by the FDA: Realize Band and Lap-Band.

The device differentiates itself from the Lap-Band AP series through its sutureless injection port installation and larger range of isostatic adjustments. The maximum fill volume for the Realize Band is 9 ml, while the newer Realize Band-C has a fill volume of 11 ml.

Gastric banding is usually not recommended for people with any of the following: *If the surgery or treatment represents an unreasonable risk to the patient *Untreated endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism *Inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as ulcers, esophagitis or Crohn's disease. *Severe cardiopulmonary diseases or other conditions which may make them poor surgical candidates in general. *An allergic reaction to materials contained in the band or who have exhibited a pain intolerance to implanted devices *Dependency on alcohol or drugs *People with severe learning or cognitive disabilities or emotionally unstable people =Special considerations for pregnancy= If considering pregnancy, ideally the patient should be in optimum nutritional condition prior to, or immediately following, conception; deflation of the band may be required prior to a planned conception. Deflation should also be considered should the patient experience morning sickness. The band may remain deflated during pregnancy and once breast feeding is completed, or if bottle feeding, the band may be gradually re-inflated to aid postpartum weight loss as needed.Dixon J, Dixon M, O’Brien P.

It is highly advised to take extra precautions during intercourse after surgery, as rapid weight loss increases fertility. Effective birth control methods must be used at all times to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Two factors have been pointed out by experts that may help explain this increase in fertility: reversal of PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and reduction in the excess of estrogen, which is produced by fat cells.Can weight loss increase fertility?, Discovery Fit & Health.

Comparison with other bariatric surgeries Unlike more open forms of weight loss surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), gastric banding does not require cutting or removing any part of the digestive system. It is removable, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure to remove the band, after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded size so it is not unusual for a person to gain weight after having a band removed. However, it is not entirely reversible as adhesions and tissue scarring are inevitable. Unlike those who have procedures such as RNY, DS, or BPD, it is unusual for gastric band patients to experience any nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption of micro-nutrients. Calcium supplements and Vitamin B12 injections are not routinely required following gastric banding (as is often the case with RNY, for example). Gastric dumping syndrome issues also do not occur since intestines are not removed or re-routed. Typically, patients who undergo adjustable gastric banding procedures lose less weight over the first 3.5 years than those who have RNY gastric bypass, BPD, or DS surgeries. Although other procedures appear to result in greater weight loss than adjustable gastric banding in the short term, results from the study by Maggard suggest that this difference decreases significantly over time.Maggard M, Shugarman L, Suttorp M, et al. Meta-analysis: surgical treatment of obesity. Annals of Internal Medicine. 2005;142:547-559. Retrieved 2010-09-16. Gastric banding patients lose an average of 47.5% of their excess weight, according to a meta analysis by Buchwald. It is important to note that, in order to maintain their weight reduction, patients must carefully follow post-operative guidelines relating to diet, exercise, and band maintenance. Weight regain is possible with any weight loss procedure, including the more radical procedures that initially result in rapid weight loss. The National Institutes of Health recommendation for weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds (½ to 1 kilogram) per week, and an average banded patient may lose this amount.Aim for a Healthy Weight, National Institutes of Health 2005;05-5213. Retrieved 2010-09-16. This is variable based on the individual and their personal circumstances, motivation, and mobility. Longer-term studies are beginning to reveal that adjustable gastric banding ( =Benefits of gastric banding when compared to other bariatric surgeries= *Lower mortality rate: only 1 in 1000 versus 1 in 250 for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery *No cutting or stapling of the stomach *Short hospital stay *Quick recovery *Adjustable without additional surgery *No malabsorption issues (because no intestines are bypassed) *Fewer life- threatening complications (see complications table for details) =Potential complications= Some studies reveal there is a decrease in adjustable gastric banding surgeries due to the increased risk of reoperation, compared to Roux- en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) bariatric procedures. One commonly reported occurrence for banded patients is regurgitation of non- acidic swallowed food from the upper pouch, commonly known as Productive Burping (PBing). Productive Burping is not to be considered normal. The patient should consider eating less, eating more slowly and chewing food more thoroughly. Occasionally, the narrow passage into the larger, lower part of the stomach might also become blocked by a large portion of unchewed or unsuitable food.Maggard M, Shugarman L, Suttorp M, et al.

This may occur silently but can cause severe problems. Urgent treatment may be required if there is any internal leak of gastric contents or bleeding. *Slippage – An unusual occurrence in which the lower part of the stomach may prolapse through the band causing an enlarged upper pouch. In severe instances this can cause an obstruction and require an urgent operation to fix.Suter M, Calmes J, Paroz A, et al.

In these cases, the patients experienced no additional adverse symptoms. *Problems with the port and/or the tube connecting port and band – The port can \\"flip over\\" so that the membrane can no longer be accessed with a needle from the outside (this often goes hand in hand with a tube kink, and may require repositioning as a minor surgical procedure under local anaesthesia); the port may get disconnected from the tube or the tube may be perforated in the course of a port access attempt (both would result in loss of fill fluid and restriction, and likewise require a minor operation). *Internal bleeding *Infection =Documented adverse effects= The following are the adverse effects of gastric banding as documented by the FDA. Losing weight after surgery=Effectiveness= New Jersey Governor Chris Christie speaking at an event in October 2015, Christie underwent lap-band stomach surgery in February 2013 and shows post surgery results can vary. The average gastric banding patient loses 500 grams to a kilogram (1–2 pounds) per week consistently, but heavier patients often lose faster in the beginning.Surgical procedures and innovations. Columbia University Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery. Retrieved 2010-10-01. This comes to roughly the first year for most band patients. It is important to keep in mind that while most of the RNY patients drop the weight faster in the beginning, some studies have found that LAGB patients will have the same percentage of excess weight loss and comparable ability to keep it off after only a couple of years. The procedure tends to encourage better eating habits which, in turn, helps in producing long term weight stability. However, with greater experience and longer patient follow up, several studies have found suboptimal weight loss and high complication rates for the gastric band. A systematic review concluded \\"LAGB has been shown to produce a significant loss of excess weight while maintaining low rates of short-term complications and reducing obesity- related comorbidities. LAGB may not result in the most weight loss but it may be an option for bariatric patients who prefer or who are better suited to undergo less invasive and reversible surgery with lower perioperative complication rates. One caution with LAGB is the uncertainty about whether the low complication rate extends past three years, given a possibility of increased band-related complications (e.g., erosion, slippage) requiring re- operation\\". Researcher Paul O’Brien, MD, of Melbourne, Australia's Monash University says the procedure offers an effective, reversible, long-term solution for weight loss as long as patients get good follow-up care and are willing to carefully control the way they eat. This study was supported by Allergan Inc., which markets a gastric band system. =Band adjustments and weight loss= Correct and sensitive adjustment of the band is imperative for weight loss and the long-term success of the procedure. Adjustments (also called \\"fills\\") may be performed using an X-ray fluoroscope so that the radiologist can assess the placement of the band, the port, and the tubing that runs between the port and the band. The patient is given a small cup of liquid containing a clear or white radio-opaque fluid similar to barium. When swallowed, the fluid is clearly shown on X–ray and is watched as it travels down the esophagus and through the restriction caused by the band. The radiologist is then able to see the level of restriction in the band and to assess if there are potential or developing issues of concern.Cherian P, Tentzeris V, Sigurdsson A. Variation of outcome in weight loss with band volume adjustments under clinical and radiological control following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Obesity Surgery. 2010;20:13–18. Retrieved 2010-10-01. These may include dilation of the esophagus, an enlarged pouch, prolapsed stomach (when part of the stomach moves into the band where it does not belong), erosion or migration. Reflux type symptoms may indicate too great a restriction and further assessment may be required. Under some circumstances, fluid is removed from the band prior to further investigation and re-evaluation. In other cases, further surgery may be required (e.g. removal of the band), should gastric erosion or a similar complication be detected. Some health practitioners adjust the band without the use of X-ray control (fluoroscopy). In these cases, the doctor assesses the patient's weight loss and potential reflex symptoms described by the patient, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or chest pain. From this information, the doctor decides whether a band adjustment is necessary. Adjustments are often indicated if a patient has regained weight, if their weight loss has leveled off, or if the patient has a distinct feeling that food is difficult to move through the stomach. During a clinical visit, patients visiting for a regular fill adjustment will typically find they will spend more time talking about the adjustment and their progress than the actual fill itself, which generally will take only about one to two minutes. However, for some patients, this type of fill is not possible, due to issues such as partial rotation of the port, or excess tissue above the port making it difficult to determine its precise location. In these cases, a fluoroscope will generally be used. It is more common practice for the band not to be filled at surgery—although some surgeons choose to place a small amount in the band at the time of surgery. The stomach tends to swell following surgery and it is possible that too great a restriction would be achieved if filled at that time. Many health practitioners make the first adjustment between 4 and 6 weeks post operatively to allow the stomach time to heal. After that, fills are performed as needed. No accurate number of adjustments required can be given. The amount of saline/isotonic solution needed in the band varies from patient to patient. There are a small number of people who find they do not need a fill at all and have sufficient restriction immediately following surgery. Others may need significant adjustments to the maximum the band is able to hold. =Post- surgical diet and care= The patient may be prescribed a liquid-only diet, followed by mushy foods and then solids. This is prescribed for a varied length of time and each surgeon and manufacturer varies. Some may find that before their first fill, they are still able to eat fairly large portions. This is not surprising since before the fill there is little or no restriction in the band. This is why a proper post-op diet and a good after-care plan are essential to success. A recent study found that patients who did not change their eating habits were 2.2 times more likely to be unsuccessful than those who did, and that patients who had not increased their physical activity were 2.3 times more likely to be unsuccessful than those who did.Chevallier J, Paita M, Rodde-Dunet M. Predictive Factors of Outcome After Gastric Banding: A Nationwide Survey on the Role of Center Activity and Patients' Behavior. Annals of Surgery. 2007;6:1034–1039. Retrieved 2010-10-01. A long-term, post- gastric-band surgery diet should consist of normal healthy food that is solid in nature and requires ample chewing to achieve a paste consistency prior to swallowing. This texture will maximise the effect of the band, rather than choosing easier wet foods, such as soups, casseroles and smoothies, which pass through the band quickly and easily resulting in greater caloric intake. Support groups exist for gastric banding patients. Some mix RNY and gastric bypass patients with gastric banding patients. Some gastric band patients have criticized this approach because, while many of the underlying issues related to obesity are the same, the needs and challenges of the two groups are very different, as are their early rates of weight loss. Some gastric band recipients feel the procedure is a failure when they see that RNY patients generally lose weight faster.  Cost of gastric banding  Adjustable gastric band surgery costs average about $15,000 in the United States, although state- specific averages range from about $10,500 (Colorado and Texas) to over $33,000 (Alaska). Services included in these costs vary by surgical clinic and hospital, but most practices include all services necessary to perform the procedure (surgeon's fee, surgical assistant fee, hospital/operating room fee, anesthesiologist fee and the device fee for the gastric band itself). Some practices also bundle a set duration of post-operative follow-up visits for filling and unfilling the gastric band as necessary (e.g., as many fills/unfills as necessary for anywhere from 3 to 13 months following surgery, depending on the practice), which as a stand-alone service cost between $15 and $300 per office visit. Most practices do not include within their quoted fees the cost of pre-operative care and testing or any potential complications that may arise. History and development of gastric banding=Non- adjustable bands= At the end of the 1970s, Wilkinson developed several surgical approaches whose common aim was to limit food intake without disrupting the continuity of the gastro-intestinal tract. In 1978 Wilkinson and Peloso were the first to place, by open procedure, a non-adjustable band (2 cm Marlex mesh) around the upper part of the stomach. The early 1980s saw further developments, with Kolle (Norway), Molina & Oria (US), Naslund (Sweden), Frydenberg (Australia) and Kuzmack (United States) implanting non- adjustable gastric bands made from a variety of different materials, including marlex mesh, dacron vascular prosthesis, silicone covered mesh and Gore-Tex, among others.Kolle K. Gastric banding (abstract). OMGI 7th Congress, Stockholm,1982;145:37Molina M, Oria HE. Gastric segmentation: a new, safe, effective, simple, readily revised and fully reversible surgical procedure for the correction of morbid obesity (abstract 15). In: 6th Bariatric Surgery Colloquium; Iowa City, IA: June 2–3, 1983 In addition, Bashour developed the \\"gastro-clip\\", a 10.5 cm polypropylene clip with a 50cc pouch and a fixed 1.25 cm stoma, which was later abandoned due to high rates of gastric erosion All these early attempts at restriction using meshes, bands and clips showed a high failure rate due to difficulty in achieving correct stomal diameter, stomach slippage, erosion, food intolerance, intractable vomiting and pouch dilatation. Despite these difficulties, an important ancillary observation was that silicone was identified as the best tolerated material for a gastric device, with far fewer adhesions and tissue reactions than other materials. Nevertheless, adjustability became the “Holy Grail” of these early pioneers. =Adjustable bands= The development of the modern adjustable gastric band is a tribute both to the vision and persistence of the early pioneers, particularly Lubomyr Kuzmak and a sustained collaborative effort on the part of bio-engineers, surgeons and scientists. Early research on the concept of band “adjustability” can be traced back to the early work of G. Szinicz (Austria) who experimented with an adjustable band, connected to a subcutaneous port, in animals. In 1986, Lubomyr Kuzmak, a Ukrainian surgeon who had emigrated to the United States in 1965, reported on the clinical use of the “adjustable silicone gastric band” (ASGB) via open surgery. Kuzmak, who from the early 1980s had been searching for a simple and safe restrictive procedure for severe obesity, modified his original silicone non-adjustable band he had been using since 1983, by adding an adjustable portion. His clinical results showed an improved weight loss and reduced complication rates compared with the non-adjustable band he had started using in 1983. Kuzmak's major contributions were the application of Mason's teachings about VBG to the development of the gastric band; the volume of the pouch; the need to overcome staple line disruption; the ratification of the use of silicone and the essential element of adjustability. Separately, but in parallel with Kuzmak, Hallberg and Forsell in Stockholm, Sweden also developed an adjustable gastric band. After further work and modifications this eventually became known as the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB). In early 1985, Dr. Dag Hallberg applied for a patent for the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB) within Scandinavian countries. In late March, Dr. Hallberg presented his idea of the \\"balloon band\\" at the Swedish Surgical Society and started to use the SAGB in a controlled series of 50 procedures. During this time, laparoscopic surgery was not common and Dr. Hallberg and his assistant, Dr. Peter Forsell, started performing the open technique to implant the SAGB. In 1992, Dr. Forsell was in contact with different surgeons in Switzerland, Italy and Germany who began to implant the SAGB with the laparoscopic technique. Dr. Forsell fully owned the patent at this time. In 1994, Dr. Forsell presented the SAGB at an international workshop for bariatric surgery in Sweden, and from then on, the SAGB started to be implanted laparoscopically. During this time, the SAGB was manufactured by a Swedish company, ATOS Medical. =The laparoscopic era= The advent of surgical laparoscopy has transformed the field of bariatric surgery and made the gastric band a more appealing option for the surgical management of obesity. In 1992, Prof. Guy-Bernard Cadière was the first to apply an adjustable band (the Kuzmak ASGB device) by the laparoscopic approach. Over the next couple of years, the Kuzmak ASGB was modified to make it suitable for laparoscopic implantation, eventually emerging as the modern lap band. This landmark innovation was driven by Belachew, Cadière, Favretti and O’Brien; the Inamed Development Company engineered the device. The first human laparoscopic implantation of the newly developed lap band was performed by Belachew and le Grand on 1 September 1993 in Huy, Belgium, followed on 8 September, by Cadière and Favretti in Padua, Italy.Cadiere GB, Favretti F, Bruyns J, et al. Gastroplastie par celiovideoscopie:technique. J Celio Chir 1994;10:27-31. In 1993, Broadbent in Australia and Catona in Italy, implanted non-adjustable (Molina-type) gastric bands by laparoscopy. In 1994, the first international laparoscopic band workshop was held in Belgium and the first on the SAGB in Sweden. Single port laparoscopy (SPL) is an advanced, minimally invasive procedure in which the surgeon operates almost exclusively through a single entry point, typically the navel. Special articulating instruments and access ports make it unnecessary to place trocars externally for triangulation, thus allowing the creation of a small, solitary portal of entry into the abdomen. The SPL technique has been used to perform many types of surgery, including adjustable gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy. In 2003, the American Institute of Gastric Banding (AIGB) True Results opened the first outpatient surgery center using advanced laparoscopic technology to be recognized by the American College of Surgeons as an Accredited Outpatient Bariatric Center in the United States. The first outpatient Lap Band procedure in the United States was performed in Texas at AIGB True Results' Surgery Center of Richardson in 2003 and since that time the AIGB True Results has performed more than 30,000 outpatient Lap Band procedures. Safety There is currently a request for a congressional investigation by members of the U.S. Congress into lapband safety, prompted by recent patient deaths after lapband surgeries at clinics affiliated with the 1-800-GET-THIN advertising campaign in Southern California.

Aftab Ahmad Sherpao said Qaumi Watan Party will work for rights of the Pashtuns of the entire region, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Karachi, Balochistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Overview At the legislative elections of 20 October 2002, Pakistan Peoples Party–Sherpao won 0.3% of the popular vote and 2 out of 272 elected members. In the 2008 general election, the party won only 1 seat in the National Assembly, in which the party leader Aftab Sherpao was successful. On the other hand, it won 6 provincial assembly seats, all in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. During the 2013 elections the party rebranded itself as the Qaumi Watan Party and Sherpao once again won the National seat, provincially the party secured 10 seats in total, of which 8 were directly elected. This made the Qaumi Watan Party the fourth largest party in the KPK Assembly, where it currently sits with the PTI-led government coalition. Flag The tricolor red-black-white flag of the party exactly resembles the flag of the Kingdom of Afghanistan during the regime of Emir Habibullah Kalakani (January 1929 – October 1929).Flags of Afghanistan The same colors were also used by the Mongols when occupying present-day Afghanistan in the 13th century.Afghanistan January 1929 - October 1929 QWP-PTI relationship The QWP initially joined the coalition government in the KPK province as a junior party of Imran Khan's PTI. The PTI then parted ways on suspicions of corruption by QWP ministers. After Qaumi Wattan Party parted ways from the KPK provincial government by Tehreek-e-Insaf of Imran Khan over corruption allegations, Sikandar Sherpao of QWP presented a letter to the media which was received from PTI Chairman Imran Khan advising to appoint a person named Khushal Khan as CEO of KPOGCL.Fake Letter Drafted by Qaumi Watan Party PTI criticized QWP for such an act as the letter contained errors and the signature of Imran Khan was seen to be different from the original one. Shireen Mazari condemned the letter in a brief press release.PTI Press Release Relations began to improve between the two party and as of 2015, QWP rejoined the PTI provincial government and its ministers re-took the oath of office, this came amongst agreement between the parties to support non- corrupt government and resulted from QWP ministers not being charged of corruption by the Ehtesab Commission.http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/67336-kp- to-have-three-senior-ministers-after-qwp-rejoins-pti- govthttp://tribune.com.pk/story/976526/two-years-on-qwp-rejoins-k-p- government/ ReferencesExternal links * Official site * Official Twitter * Official Facebook Category:Islamic socialist political parties Category:Social democratic parties in Pakistan Category:Pakistan Peoples Party Category:Pashtun nationalism ","title":"Qaumi Watan Party"},{"id":"2275696","text":"The saiga antelope (, Saiga tatarica), or saiga, is a critically endangered antelope which during antiquity inhabited a vast area of the Eurasian steppe spanning the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains in the northwest and Caucasus in the southwest into Mongolia in the northeast and Dzungaria in the southeast. During the Pleistocene, they also occurred in Beringian North America and the British Isles. Today, the dominant subspecies (S. t. tatarica) is only found in one region in Russia (in the Republic of Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast) and three areas in Kazakhstan (the Ural, Ustiurt, and Betpak-Dala populations). A portion of the Ustiurt population migrates south to Uzbekistan and occasionally Turkmenistan in winter. It is extinct in China and southwestern Mongolia. It was hunted extensively in Romania and Moldova until it became extinct in those regions at the end of the 18th century. The Mongolian subspecies (S. t. mongolica) is found only in western Mongolia. Taxonomy and phylogeny The scientific name of the saiga is Saiga tatarica. It is the sole extant member of its genus and is classified in the family Bovidae. This species was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 12th edition of Systema Naturae (1766). Linnaeus gave it the name Capra tatarica. The relationship between the saiga and the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) has long been debated. English zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock classified them under different subfamilies in 1910. In 1945, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson classified both in the tribe Saigini under the same subfamily, Caprinae. Subsequent authors were not certain about the relationship between the two, until phylogenetic studies in the 1990s revealed that though morphologically similar, the Tibetan antelope is closer to the Caprinae while the saiga is closer to the Antilopinae. In a revision of the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini on the basis of nuclear and mitochondrial data in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues showed that the saiga is sister to the clade formed by the springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) and the gerenuk (Litocranius walleri). The study noted that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably different from the rest of the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study. Two subspecies are recognised: *S. t. mongolica Bannikov, 1946: Also known as the Mongolian saiga, it is sometimes treated as an independent species, or as subspecies of S. borealis; it is confined to Mongolia. *S. t. tartarica (Linnaeus, 1766): Also known as the Russian saiga, it occurs in central Asia. Evolution Saiga antelope skull and taxidermy mount on display at the Museum of Osteology Fossils of saiga, concentrated mainly in central and northern Eurasia, date to as early as the late Pleistocene (nearly 0.1 Mya). An extinct species of Saiga, S. borealis, has been identified from the Pleistocene of northern Eurasia. Fossils excavated from the Buran Kaya III site (Crimea) date back to the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene. The morphology of saiga does not seem to have changed significantly since prehistoric times. Before the Holocene, the saiga ranged from as far west as modern-day England and France to as far east as northern Siberia, Alaska, and probably Canada. The antelope gradually entered the Urals, though it did not colonise southern Europe. A 2010 study revealed that a steep decline has occurred in the genetic variability of the saiga since the late Pleistocene-Holocene, probably due to a population bottleneck.  Characteristics  The saiga stands at the shoulder, and weighs . The head- and-body length is typically between . A prominent feature of the saiga is the pair of closely spaced, bloated nostrils directed downward. Other facial features include the dark markings on the cheeks and the nose, and the long ears. During summer migrations, a saiga's nose helps filter out dust kicked up by the herd and cools the animal's blood. In the winter, it heats up the frigid air before it is taken to the lungs. The coat shows seasonal changes. In summer, the coat appears yellow to red, fading toward the flanks. The Mongolian saiga can develop a sandy colour. The coat develops a pale, grayish- brown colour in winter, with a hint of brown on the belly and the neck. The ventral parts are generally white. The hairs, that measure long in summer, can grow as long as in winter. This forms a mane on the neck. Two distinct moults can be observed in a year, one in spring (April to May) and another in autumn (late September or early October to late November or early December). The tail measures . Only males possess horns. These horns, thick and slightly translucent, are wax-coloured and show 12 to 20 pronounced rings. With a base diameter of , the horns of the Russian saiga measure in length; the horns of the Mongolian saiga, however, reach a maximum length of .  Ecology and behavior  Male saiga Saigas form very large herds that graze in semideserts, steppes, grasslands, and possibly open woodlands, eating several species of plants, including some that are poisonous to other animals. They can cover long distances and swim across rivers, but they avoid steep or rugged areas. The mating season starts in November, when stags fight for the acceptance of females. The winner leads a herd of five to 50 females. In springtime, mothers come together in mass to give birth. Two-thirds of births are twins; the remaining third of births are single calves. Herd of saiga antelope gathered at the water's edge in western Kazakhstan Fawn hidden in the grasses Saigas, like the Mongolian gazelles, are known for their extensive migrations across the steppes that allow them to escape natural calamities. Saigas are highly vulnerable to wolves. Juveniles are targeted by foxes, steppe eagles, golden eagles, dogs, and ravens. Distribution and habitat Remains of male saiga killed by a pair of gray wolves at a waterhole, Chu River valley, Kazakhstan, 3 November 1955 =Antiquity= During the last glacial period, the saigas ranged from the British Isles through Central Asia and the Bering Strait into Alaska and Canada's Yukon and Northwest Territories. By the classical age, they were apparently considered a characteristic animal of Scythia, judging from the historian Strabo's description of an animal called the kolos that was \\"between the deer and ram in size\\" and was (understandably but wrongly) believed to drink through its nose. Considerable evidence shows the importance of the antelope to Andronovo culture settlements. Illustrations of saiga antelopes can be found among the cave paintings that were dated back to seventh to fifth century BC. Moreover, saiga bones were found among the remains of other wild animals near the human settlements. =From the 14th century to the 20th century= The fragmented information shows an abundance of saigas on the territory of modern Kazakhstan in the 14th-16th centuries. The migratory routes ranged throughout the country's area, especially the region between the Volga and Ural Rivers was heavily populated. The population's size remained high until the second half of the 19th century, when excessive horn export began. The high price and demand for horns drove radical hunting. The number of animals decreased in all regions and the migratory routes shifted southward.. After a rapid decline, they were nearly completely exterminated in the 1920s, but they were able to recover. By 1950, two million of them were found in the steppes of the USSR. Their population fell drastically following the collapse of the USSR due to uncontrolled hunting and demand for horns in Chinese medicine. At one point, some conservation groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, encouraged the hunting of this species, as its horn was presented as an alternative to that of a rhinoceros. =The present population decline= Today, the populations have again shrunk enormously – as much as 95% in 15 years. The saiga is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN. An estimated total number of 50,000 saigas survives today in Kalmykia, three areas of Kazakhstan, and in two isolated areas of Mongolia. Another small population in the Pre-Caspian region of Russia remains under extreme threat. Cherny Zemli Nature Reserve was created in Russia's Kalmykia Republic in the 1990s to protect the local saiga population. Kalmykia's president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov announced 2010 as the Year of Saiga in Kalmykia. In Kazakhstan, the number of saigas was found to be increasing, from around 21,000 at the beginning of this millennium to around 81,000 in January 2010. However, in May 2010, an estimated 12,000 of the 26,000 saiga population in the Ural region of Kazakhstan have been found dead. Although the deaths are currently being ascribed to pasteurellosis, an infectious disease that strikes the lungs and intestines, the underlying trigger remains to be identified. In May 2015, what may be the same disease broke out in three northern regions of the country. As of 28 May 2015, more than 120,000 saigas have been confirmed dead in the Betpak-Dala population in central Kazakhstan, representing more than a third of the global population. By April, 2016, the saigas appear to be making a comeback, with an increase of population from 31,000 to 36,000 in the Betpak-Dala area. =Mongolian saiga= The Mongolian saiga (S. t. mongolica) is found in a small area in western Mongolia around the Sharga and Mankhan Nature Reserves.  Threats and conservation  The Museum of Zoology, St. Petersburg Examples of saiga horn products seized by the Hong Kong government The horn of the saiga antelope is used in traditional Chinese medicine and can sell for as much as US$150. Demand for the horns has wiped out the population in China, where the saiga antelope is a class I protected species, and drives poaching and smuggling. Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Concerning Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use of the Saiga Antelope was concluded and came into effect 24 September 2006. The saiga's decline being one of the fastest population collapses of large mammals recently observed, the MoU aims to reduce current exploitation levels and restore the population status of these nomads of the Central Asian steppes. In June 2014, Chinese customs at the Kazakh border uncovered 66 cases containing 2,351 saiga antelope horns, estimated to be worth over Y70.5 million (US$11 million).新疆霍尔果斯海关破获一起羚羊角走私案 天山网 (Chinese) 2014-06-23 At that price, each horn would cost over US$4,600. In June 2015, E.J. Milner-Gulland (chair of Saiga Conservation Alliance) said, \\"Antipoaching needs to be a top priority for the Russian and Kazakh governments.\\" = Hunting saiga = Saigas have been a target of hunting since prehistoric ages, when hunting was an essential means to acquire food. Saigas' horns, meat, and skin have commercial value and are exported from Kazakhstan. Saiga horn, known as , is one of the main ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine that is used as an extract or powder additive to the elixirs, ointments, and drinks. Saiga horn's value is equal to rhinoceros horn, whose trade was banned in 1993. is thought to be a cheaper substitute of rare rhino horn in most TCM recipes. Although the hunting and trade is considered illegal, the horn products still can be found sold publicly and openly in a great variety of venues and businesses. In the period from 1955 to 1989, over 87 thousand tonnes of meat were collected in Kazakhstan by killing more than five million saiga. In 2011, Kazakhstan reaffirmed a ban on hunting saiga and extended this ban until 2021. Saiga meat is compared to lamb, considered to be nutritious and delicious. Numerous recipes for cooking the antelope's meat can be found. Both meat and byproducts are sold in the country and outside of it. About 45–80 dm2 of skin can be yielded from one individual depending on its age and sex. The skin is used to produce suede and box calf. = Physical barriers = Agricultural advancement and human settlements have been shrinking habitat areas of the saigas since the 20th century. Occupants limited saiga's passage to water resources and the winter and summer habitats. The ever-changing face of steppe requires saigas to search for new routes to their habitual lands. Currently, saiga populations' migratory routes pass five countries and different man-made constructions, such as railways, trenches, mining sites, and pipelines. These physical barriers limit movement of the antelopes. Cases of saiga herds being trapped within fenced areas and starving to death have been reported. Starting in 2011, Kazakhstan has built more than 150 km of wire fence at the border with Uzbekistan. This fence limits seasonal migration of saigas and other smaller animals. Although concerns have been stated, the fences are still being built. = Climatic variability = Saigas are dependent on weather and affected by climate fluctuations to a great extent due to their migratory nature. Harsh winters with strong winds or high snow coverage disable feeding on the grass under the thick snow. Population size usually dramatically decreases after severe cold months. Recent trends in climate change lead to increasing aridity of the steppe region, thus, deficiency of the grazing pastureland. An estimate of 14% or more of available pastureland is considered degraded and useless. Consequently, small steppe rivers dry faster, limiting water resources to large lakes and rivers, which are usually populated by human settlements. Moreover, high temperatures in the steppe region lead to springtime floods, in which saiga calves can drown. = Mass mortalities 1980 to 2015 = For ungulates, mass mortalities are not uncommon. In the 1980s, several saiga die-offs occurred, and between 2010 and 2014, one occurred every year. The deaths could be linked to calving aggregation, which is when they are most vulnerable. More recent research involving a mass die-off in 2015 indicates warmer weather and attendant humidity caused bacteria common in saiga antelopes to move into the bloodstream and cause hemorrhagic septicemia. = 2015–2016 epizootic = In May 2015, uncommonly large numbers of saigas began to die from a mysterious epizootic illness suspected to be pasteurellosis. Herd fatality is 100% once infected, with an estimated 40% of the species' total population already dead. More than 120,000 carcasses had been found by late May 2015, while the estimated total population was only 250,000. Biologist Murat Nurushev suggested that the cause might be acute ruminal tympany, whose symptoms (bloating, mouth foaming, and diarrhea) had been observed in dead saiga antelopes. According to Nurushev, this disease occurred as a result of foraging on a large amount of easily fermenting plants (alfalfa, clover, sainfoins, and mixed wet, green grass). In May 2015, the United Nations agency which is involved in saiga conservation efforts issued a statement that the mass die-off had ended. By June 2015, no definitive cause for the epizootic had been found.Saiga mystery disease; 29 May 2015 At a scientific meeting in November 2015 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Dr. Richard A. Kock (of the Royal Veterinary College in London) reported that his colleagues and he had narrowed down the possible culprits. Climate change and stormy spring weather, they said, may have transformed harmless bacteria, carried by the saigas, into lethal pathogens. Pasteurella multocida, a bacterium, was determined to be the cause of death. The bacterium occurs in the antelopes and is normally harmless; the reason for the change in behavior of the bacterium is unknown. Now, scientists and researchers believe the unusually warm and wet uncontrolled environmental variables caused the bacterium to enter the bloodstream and become septic. Hemorrhagic septicemia is the likely cause of the most recent deaths The change of the bacteria may be attributed to \\"the response of opportunistic microbes to changing environmental conditions\\". The Betpak-Dala saiga population in central Kazakhstan, which had the most deaths, increased from 31,000 after the epidemic to 36,000 by April 2016. In late 2016, a large loss of the population happened in Mongolia. The etiology was confirmed to be goat plague in early 2017. = In captivity = Currently, only the Moscow Zoo and Askania-Nova keep saigas. Cologne Zoological Garden and San Diego Zoo had them in the past. Pleistocene Park in northern Siberia plans to introduce the species.

Life  A forester's son, Richard Dehmel was born in Hermsdorf near Wendisch Buchholz (now a part of Münchehofe) in the Brandenburg Province, Kingdom of Prussia. He got his first impressions of nature, wandering the oak forests tended by his father, and first attended school in his hometown. He then attended the Sophiengymnasium (a Berlin gymnasium) yet was expelled after clashing with the headteacher. He finished his school days in Danzig and, subsequently, studied the natural sciences, economics, literature, and philosophy at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in Berlin and then at Leipzig University, where he obtained a doctorate in economics with a thesis on the insurance industry.Burns, Friedrich (1980). \\"Dehmel, Richard\\". In Jean Albert Bédé & William Benbow Edgerton (Eds.), Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature (p. 195). New York: Columbia University Press. ; . He then worked as a secretary at a fire insurance association, and remained in this position until, after the publication of his second volume of poetry, he turned full-time writer. In 1889, Dehmel married Paula Oppenheimer, sister of Franz Oppenheimer. He became active as a writer and co-founded Pan magazine in 1894. Dehmel divorced Paula in 1899 and traveled Europe with Ida Auerbach (née Coblentz), who had formerly been engaged to Dehmel's rival Stefan George. Dehmel married Ida in 1901, and that same year they settled in Hamburg. Dehmel's poetic volume Weib und Welt (Woman and World) triggered a scandal in the late 1890s: denounced by the deeply conservative poet Börries von Münchhausen, Dehmel was tried for obscenity and blasphemy.Stark, Gary D. (2009). Banned in Berlin: Literary Censorship in Imperial Germany, 1871–1918. New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books. p. 204. . Despite being acquitted on technical grounds, the court condemned the work as obscene and blasphemous and ordered that it be burned.Stark, Gary D. (2009). Banned in Berlin: Literary Censorship in Imperial Germany, 1871–1918. New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books. pp. 250–251. . Dehmel would again be prosecuted for obscenity and blasphemy, but again acquitted as earlier. Dehmel was a champion of the rights of workers. However, despite his record of fighting conservatives, Dehmel joined the many patriotic and pro-war German intellectuals who invoked the masses to support the German Empire after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Fifty-one at the time, Dehmel volunteered in 1914 and served until 1916, when he was wounded. He called on the Germans to keep fighting right until 1918. Dehmel died in 1920 in Blankenese from the after-effects of an injury sustained during the war.  Literary work  Dehmel is considered one of the foremost German poets of the pre-World War I era. His poems are finished in form and use numerous metrical patterns. They were set to music by composers such as Richard Strauss (who met his principal librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal at Dehmel's house), Max Reger, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Oskar Fried, Alma Mahler, Anton Webern, Ignatz Waghalter, Carl Orff, and Kurt Weill, or they inspired them to write music. Dehmel's main theme was \\"love and sex (Eros)\\", which he framed as a power to break away from middle-class values and fetters.

Conceptually, the term authoritarian personality originated from the writings of Erich Fromm, and usually is applied to men and women who exhibit a strict and oppressive personality towards their subordinates.Baars, J. & Scheepers, P. (1993). \\"Theoretical and Methodological Foundations of the Authoritarian Personality\\". Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 29, pp. 345–353. Historical origins In The Authoritarian Personality (1950), Theodor W. Adorno and Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson and Nevitt Sanford proposed a personality type that involved the \\"potentially fascistic individual.\\" The historical background that influenced the theoretical development of the authoritarian personality included the rise of fascism in the 1930s, the Second World War (1939–1945), and the Holocaust, which indicated that the fascistic individual was psychologically susceptible to the ideology of anti- Semitism and to the emotional appeal of anti-democratic politics. Known as the Berkeley studies, the researches of Adorno and Frenkel-Brunswik, and of Levinson and Sanford concentrated upon prejudice, which they studied within psychoanalytic and psychosocial frameworks of Freudian and Frommian theories. Authoritarian personality type The authoritarian personality has a strict superego, which controls a weak ego that is unable to cope with the strong impulses of the id. The resulting intrapsychic conflicts cause personal insecurities, which result in the superego adhering to externally imposed conventional norms (conventionalism), and unquestioning obedience to the authorities who impose and administer the social norms of society (authoritarian submission). The ego-defense mechanism of psychological projection arises when the authoritarian person avoids self-reference to the anxiety-producing impulse(s) of the id, by projecting the impulse(s) onto the \\"inferior\\" minority social-groups of the culture (projectivity), which are expressed by way of greatly evaluative and harshly judgemental beliefs (power and toughness) and rigid (stereotypy). The authoritarian person also presents a cynical and disdainful view of humanity, and a need to wield power and be tough, which arise from the anxieties produced by the perceived lapses of people who do not abide by the conventions and social norms of society (destructiveness and cynicism); a general tendency to focus upon people who violate the value system, and to act oppressively against them (authoritarian aggression); anti-intellectualism, a general opposition to the subjective and imaginative tendencies of the mind (anti-intraception); a tendency to believe in mystic determination (superstition); and an exaggerated concern with sexual promiscuity. In human psychological development, the formation of the authoritarian personality occurs within the first years of a child's life, strongly influenced and shaped by the parents' personalities and the organizational structure of the child's family; thus, parent-child relations that are \\"hierarchical, authoritarian, [and] exploitative\\" can result in a child developing an authoritarian personality.Adorno et al., The Authoritarian Personality (1950) pp. 482–484. Authoritarian-personality characteristics are fostered by parents who have a psychological need for domination, and who harshly threaten their child to compel obedience to conventional behaviors. Moreover, such domineering parents also are preoccupied with social status, a concern they communicate by having the child follow rigid, external rules. In consequence of such domination, the child suffers emotionally from the suppression of his or her feelings of aggression and resentment towards the domineering parents, whom the child reverently idealizes, but does not criticize. Links to gender inequality According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of gender inequality and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals. Interpretations Bob Altemeyer used the right- wing authoritarianism (RWA) scale, to identify, measure, and quantify the personality traits of authoritarian people.Altemeyer, Bob (1998) \\"The Other 'Authoritarian Personality' , Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, pp. 30, 47–91. The political personality type identified with the RWA scale indicates the existence of three psychological tendencies and attitudinal clusters characteristic of the authoritarian personality: (i) Submission to legitimate authorities; (ii) Aggression towards minority groups whom authorities identified as targets for sanctioned political violence; and (iii) Adherence to cultural values and political beliefs endorsed by the authorities.McCrae and Costa (1997). Conceptions and Correlates of Openness to Experience. Handbook of Personality Psychology, R. Hogan, J. Johnson, S. Briggs, Eds). pp. 835–847. As measured with the NEO-PI-R Openness scale, the research indicates a negative correlation (r=0.57) between the personality trait of \\"openness to experience\\", of the Five Factor Model of the human personality. The research of Jost, Glaser, Arie W. Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003) indicates that authoritarianism and right-wing authoritarianism are ideological constructs for social cognition, by which political conservatives view people who are the Other who is not the Self. That the authoritarian personality and the conservative personality share two, core traits: (i) resistance to change (social, political. economic), and (ii) justification for social inequality among the members of society. Conservatives have a psychological need to manage existential uncertainty and threats with situational motives (striving for dominance in social hierarchies) and with dispositional motives (self-esteem and the management of fear). The research on ideology, politics, and racist prejudice, by John Duckitt and Chris Sibley, identified two types of authoritarian worldview: (i) that the social world is dangerous, which leads to right-wing authoritarianism; and (ii) that the world is a ruthlessly competitive jungle, which leads to social dominance orientation. In a meta-analysis of the research, Sibley and Duckitt explained that the social-dominance orientation scale helps to measure the generalization of prejudice and other authoritarian attitudes that can exist within social groups. Although both the right-wing authoritarianism scale and the social-dominance orientation scale can accurately measure authoritarian personalities, the scales usually are not correlated. =CriticismEarly research= These researchers' most noteworthy measurement for authoritarianism is the \\"F-scale\\", designed to tap a set of beliefs thought to be associated with authoritarianism without the need for specific out-groups indicated. Kirscht and Dillehay (1967)Kirscht, JP, & Dillehay, RC. (1967). Dimensions of Authoritarianism: A Review of Research and Theory. University of Kentucky Press: Lexington, TN. outlined several problems with the Berkeley studies, including response bias. Response bias results from the F scale being uniformly worded in a confirming direction. Hence, if one tends to respond in agreement with items, regardless of their content, one is rated as an authoritarian by such a test. Several studies have shown that more variance of the F scale can be explained by response bias than the content of the items (Kirscht & Dillehay, 1967).

LEA Hillside, NJ conducted by clinicians using the Rorschach inkblots, and in one study, the F scale for authoritarianism, found that these ex-Nazis score high on three dimensions (anti-intraception, superstition and stereotyping, and projectivity), but not all nine dimensions as the theory predicted. One of the first applications of the authoritarian scales in academia was by Stern and colleagues, in the early 1950s, at the University of Chicago.Wiggins, J.S. (1980). Personality and Prediction: Principles of Personality Assessment. Addison-Wesley. Reading, Mass. The hypothesized prediction was that \\"authoritarian\\" students would have difficulty in the sciences and humanities, and use of an attitudinal scale was a successful predictor. =Validity= Among the criticisms of the sociologic theory presented in The Authoritarian Personality (1950) are the validity of the psychoanalytic interpretation of personality; methodological inadequacies of the California F-scale personality test; and bias that authoritarianism exists only in the right wing of the political spectrum. In addition an analysis examining the authoritarian personality approach written by C.G. Sibley and J. Duckitt reported that more recent research has produced two more effective scales of measurement for authoritative personalities. The first scale is called the Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and the second is called the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). They have proved to be highly reliable in predicting prejudice and other characteristics associated with authoritative personalities. In The Anti-authoritarian Personality (1977) W.P. Kreml found stylistic similarities between authoritarians and anti-authoritarians (dogmatism, rigidity, etc.), and that variable constructs, such as (a) the relative need for order, (b) the relative need for power, (c) the rejection or acceptance of impulse, and (d) extroversion-versus-introversion, differentiated the two types of personality, and could underpin a full- spectrum psycho-political theory.Kreml, William P. The Anti-Authoritarian Personality (1977) Oxford;New York:Pergamon Press.. Wiggins provided an insightful explanation of how the authoritarian construct is an example of the synthetic approach to personality assessment. In short, in the synthetic approach, the assumption is that those with authoritarian personality characteristics are assessed with researcher's intuitive model of what characteristics fit the criterion role requirements of the predicted situation (support of Fascism). Hence, it is not a completely empirical approach to prediction, but rather based on \\"arm chair\\" situational analysis of the criteria, and intuited psychological characteristics to be assessed that fit the situation. More recently, Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003)Jost, JT., Glaser, J., Kruglanski, AW., and Sulloway, FJ. (2003). \\"Political conservatism as motivated social cognition.\\" Psychological Bulletin, 129. pp 339–375. have presented how the traditional research in authoritarianism or conservatism has confounded the psychological variables (e.g., personality characteristics) with the political criteria (conservative attitudes). Hence the scales measuring individual differences on authoritarianism often include the criteria attitudinal statements of political ideologies. The personality construct for the authoritarian personality proposed that the social environment influenced the expression of prejudice, based upon the social forces of the time, because the authoritarian person's ideology is created within the culture. Yet, in \\"The Social Being and Social Psychology\\" (1998) S. TaylorTaylor, S. (1998). \\"The social being in social psychology.\\" In The Handbook of Social Psychology, 4th, ed. (Eds. Gilbert, D.T., Fiske, S., and Lindzey, G). pp. 58–95. said that the hypothesized interaction of society and the authoritarian person was lost to the subsequent research that used the F-scale in differential psychological studies. Given the science of personality assessment, the variety of methods Adorno, et al. used are now unsupported, and might explain that lack of empirical studies using the F scale or the other scales developed by Adorno et al. in subsequent research. An example of the social environment impact is presented by Gibb (1969)Gibb, C. A. (1969). \\"Leadership.\\" The Handbook of Social Psychology, Vol IV. pp. 205–282. Lindzey. G., & Aronson, E. (Eds.). Addison-Wesley: Reading, Mass in his critique of personality traits and leadership, where a study by Katz suggested that the social situation can override personality differences. In the study, groups of black and white students were formed. Some mixed racial groups had students scoring high authoritarian F scores, and in other mixed groups, low F score students. Comparisons of high authoritarian white students to those not scoring authoritarian indicated that the former student type were more cooperative and less willing to endorse stereotypes towards blacks. Situational norms against prejudicial perceptions might have influenced authoritarian students to act less prejudicial in order to conform to the prescribed norm. Altemeyer's analytical research indicated that of the nine personality components hypothesized, only three components correlated: (i) authoritarian submission, (ii) authoritarian aggression, and (iii) conventionalism.Altemeyer, B.

It occurred at Sacheon where Yi Sunsin's fleet managed to destroy 13 large Japanese ships. It was the first battle of Admiral Yi's 2nd Campaign in the Imjin War, between Japan and Korea, when the turtle ship was first used. Prelude Yi Sunsin received news from Won Gyun that the Japanese were already at Sacheon and the surrounding area. Fearing that they were planning an attack on Yeosu, Yi Sunsin set sail with 26 warships on May 29 (Gregorian: July 8). He met up with Won Gyun at Noryang and ordered him to mop up stragglers after the battle and then approached Sacheon. Situation at Sacheon Admiral Yi scrutinized the surrounding area. A large cliff overlooked the city and Japanese soldiers seemed to move about everywhere in the city. Twelve very large Japanese warships were anchored in the harbor, along with numerous other smaller ships. Admiral Yi knew that he could not attack the Japanese in a spearhead assault because he knew that the Japanese could direct arquebus fire down on the Koreans from the top of the cliffs. Admiral Yi wanted to fight the Japanese in the sea where there was more room to maneuver. Hoping to draw the Japanese into open waters, he turned his battleships around and withdrew. Apparently, the Japanese commander had been observing the Korean movements and quickly ordered his captains to take a portion of the fleet anchored at Sacheon and attack the Koreans when he saw them withdraw. Taking the bait, the Japanese pursued the Koreans. The Turtle Ship The Battle of Sacheon was the first battle during which Admiral Yi deployed the turtle ship. By the time the Koreans and the Japanese were out on the open sea, it was nearly dark. Nonetheless, Admiral Yi had the turtle ship and his other vessels turn around quickly and fire upon the Japanese. Admiral Yi had his men unleash a hail of cannonballs and fire arrows. This had an immediate effect on the enemy warships, and the Japanese ships started taking heavy damage. The fierce and sudden Korean attack shocked the Japanese. But unlike their previous poor performance at the Battle of Okpo, the Japanese soldiers fought bravely and returned fire with their arquebuses in a timely manner. Unfortunately for the Japanese, they did not have a chance to board the Korean ships because of concentrated Korean cannon fire. Also, the turtle ship was impossible to board anyway due to iron spikes on its roof. Then, the Japanese began to panic when the turtle ship smashed into Japanese lines, firing in every direction. It was in the heat of the battle when the course of Korea's history nearly changed; Admiral Yi was shot by a Japanese arquebusier. The Korean captains were shocked. However, the bullet only punctured the skin of his left arm leaving Admiral Yi with a very minor injury. Aftermath In a couple of hours, every single Japanese warship that had fought was destroyed. Yi Sunsin destroyed all the large Japanese ships and left a few small enemy ships behind hoping to lure back the Japanese who had fled. A few survivors struggled ashore. The Battle of Sacheon caused the Japanese command at Busan some anxiety, as the supply ships that sailed from Japan might be in danger.

It is the ancestral seat of the Marquess of Hertford. History Ragley Hall illustrated by Jan Kip in Le Nouveau Théâtre de la Grande Bretagne, 1697-99. The house, which was designed by Dr Robert Hooke, was built for Edward Conway, 1st Earl of Conway and completed after his death in 1683. The Great Hall is thought to have been decorated by James Wyatt in 1780. It became the home of Anne Conway and she was visited there by a number of notable people including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Thomas Vaughan, Lilias Skene, Henry More, Ezechiel Foxcroft, Elizabeth of Bohemia, and Christian Knorr von Rosenroth. Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont was Anne's physician from 1671 until her death in 1679. Financial instability of the Seymour family left the house threatened with demolition more than once. In 1912, following the death of Hugh Seymour, 6th Marquess of Hertford, the estate's trustees recommended that the house be demolished. However, during World War I and World War II, the house found use as a military hospital. Hugh Seymour, 8th Marquess of Hertford, who inherited Ragley Hall from his uncle in 1940, fought to save it after the war. It was refurbished between 1956 and 1958, when it became one of the first stately homes opened to the public. In 1983, the painter Graham Rust completed a huge mural including pets, friends and family members which is known as \\"The Temptation\\" and is exhibited on the Southern staircase. Ragley was the site of the Jerwood Sculpture Park, opened in July 2004. The Park included works that won the Jerwood Sculpture Prizes, and the work of Dame Elisabeth Frink, among others. However the site was closed in April 2012. In popular culture Ragley Hall was used as a location in the 1982 television version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. Ragley Hall represented the Palace of Versailles in the fourth episode of the second series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, titled \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\", first broadcast in May 2006.

He is best known for being a member of the tag team Phi Delta Slam as well as his appearances in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. In early 2009 he returned to TNA under ring name Big Rocco as one half of The Main Event Mafia's (and later Mick Foley's) personal security force. Professional wrestling career Tilly worked for World Championship Wrestling throughout the mid-1990s as a jobber. He later began wrestling primarily on the Floridian independent circuit, where he formed a tag team with Bruno Sassi known as Phi Delta Slam. Phi Delta Slam used the gimmick of a pair of boisterous fraternity members. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005, 2007, 2009-2010)= Phi Delta Slam were introduced to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) after Dusty Rhodes told his two competing assistants, Traci Brooks and Trinity, to each find a tag team. The tag teams would wrestle one another at Destination X, with the winning tag team's sponsor becoming Rhodes' sole assistant. Trinity selected Phi Delta Slam, and they debuted in February 2005, wrestling dark matches. They made their on-screen debut on March 13 at Destination X, where they lost to Traci's choice, The Harris Brothers. Phi Delta Slam remained in TNA for several weeks afterwards, but were unable to get over with fans, and began appearing only sporadically with the promotion. In September 2005, their profiles were removed from the TNA website, confirming that the team was gone from TNA. Tilly and Sassi later made a cameo appearance in a series of comedy segments on the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact! where they were seen at Eric Young's Christmas party, which also involved the likes of Luke Williams, Kevin Nash, ODB, and Awesome Kong. Return In early 2009, both Tilly and Sassi returned to TNA as the personal security of The Main Event Mafia in order to help them fend off The TNA Front Line. In order play into the mafia aspect of the stable, Tilly was renamed to Rocco (before it was later tweaked to Big Rocco), he began wearing sunglasses at all times, he dyed his normally brown hair to black and began sporting a goatee. On the March 13 edition of Impact!, Sal and Kurt Angle accompanied Rocco as he wrestled Front Line member Eric Young in the main event, which he lost after Young pinned him following a Death Valley driver. On the April 2 edition of Impact!, Rocco and Sal challenged and lost to Team 3D. On the May 7 edition of Impact! they were defeated in a handicap match by Matt Morgan. On the May 28 edition of Impact! Sting, the new leader of the Main Event Mafia, fired Rocco and Sal. On the June 4, 2009, edition of Impact! Rocco and Sal were hired by Mick Foley. The two of them have since made only sporadic appearances as security men. On August 8, 2010, at ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, Tilquist portrayed a fake version of The Blue Meanie, using the name Blue Tilly, and, along with Hollywood Nova, accompanied Stevie Richards to the ring. Later in the night Tilly and Nova attacked Tommy Dreamer during his match with Raven. =Independent circuit= Phi Delta Slam is currently wrestling with the South Florida based Coastal Championship Wrestling.

The population was 620 (2016 Census)https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp- pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1;=DA&Code1;=35060399&Geo2;=PR&Code2;=01&Data;=Count&SearchText;=35060399&SearchType;=Begins&SearchPR;=01&B1;=All&Custom;=&TABID;=3, up from 373 (2011 Census), and 57 in 2006 and 50 in 2001.  Early history  LeBreton Flats after the 1900 fire. = Founding = LeBreton Flats was named after Lieutenant John LeBreton (1779-1848), one of Nepean Township's first settlers (c. 1819) and a hero of the War of 1812, as an officer in the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and between April and October 1812 he acted as adjutant to the Voltigeurs Canadiens. LeBreton purchased the area in 1820, a purchase which has been described as solely for the purpose of capitalizing on the construction of the planned Rideau Canal. The account, according to his detractors, goes as follows. In 1820, LeBreton lived at the community of Britannia, west of Ottawa and overheard Lord Dalhousie explain that the intended plan for the Rideau Canal was from Dow's Lake to the Chaudière Falls, directly crossing the flats. LeBreton bought the land for £499, before Lord Dalhousie had a chance to purchase the territory. LeBreton then offered to sell the land to Dalhousie for £3000. Dalhousie recognized LeBreton's land speculation and was so infuriated he decided to move the canal to Entrance Bay, the current location where the canal enters into the Ottawa River. This significantly raised the cost of the canal, as it was a longer route and additional locks were now required. At the same time, Dalhousie purchased neighbouring Barracks Hill as part of the agreement, which would become Parliament Hill. For his part, LeBreton vigorously maintained that he had purchased the land fairly at a public auction and that he had been grievously wronged by Dalhousie and those in the community who took the Governor General's side. LeBreton claimed he was one of the few to grasp the commercial value of the flats and that he had begun to make offers to acquire land there as early as 1818, well before the canal was approved or any route revealed. LeBreton presented Dalhousie with a lengthy written defence against the allegations. These arguments Dalhousie somewhat peremptorily dismissed, entrenching the notion of LeBreton as a swindler in local legend.Hill, Hamnett P., pp. 24-39 = 19th-century development = By the mid-19th century, LeBreton Flats developed into a mixed community to serve the lumber mills on the nearby Chaudière and Victoria islands. A rail line came in with a station and yards, and industries developed in turn. There was also housing for both the workers and owners, as well as hotels and taverns. The area was ravaged by the Great Fire of 1900, which had started across the river in Hull (now Gatineau, Quebec), but crossed over by way of the great stacks of piled lumber on the islands. The fire destroyed the neighbourhood, leaving many homeless. The area was rebuilt, but the lumber barons relocated their dwellings up into the city proper above the escarpment, leaving the workers as the remaining Flats' residents.  Urban renewal and redevelopment  Two children in LeBreton Flats in 1963, as the lands were being expropriated and the residents forced to vacate the neighbourhood. In the 1960s, expropriation occurred in order to make room for redevelopment, including offices for the Government of Canada. Ottawa Valley artist Ralph Wallace Burton documented the neighbourhood in his Lebreton Flats series of oil sketches (now on display in Ottawa City Hall), \\"working just ahead of the demolition crews\\". As a result of disputes over the use of the land and soil contamination from the previous industrial uses, the land remained vacant for over forty years. It was used in the winter for piling snow that had been removed from Ottawa streets, with the pile often remaining well into the late spring. As a result of the runoff from this snowpile, the land became more contaminated. Because of this, it was found that almost all of the area's topsoil would have to be removed in order for redevelopment to proceed, but the ownership had to be consolidated, since the Government of Canada, the former Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton government, and the City of Ottawa were all landowners. This situation was remedied with a federal agency called the National Capital Commission (NCC) acquiring all title to the land. In May 2005, the new home for the Canadian War Museum was opened on LeBreton Flats as the first component of redevelopment. There are plans to use the remainder of the site for housing, commercial space, offices and parkland. The southern part of LeBreton Flats between Albert Street and Nanny Goat Hill escaped the expropriation of the 1960s. In this area, brick houses and townhouses built immediately following the 1900 fire still exist alongside row housing built in the 1970s. The portion of Lorne Avenue which lies below Nanny Goat Hill is an example of the housing which filled LeBreton prior to the 1960s and is a Heritage District designated by the City of Ottawa. The western portion of the Transitway ran through LeBreton Flats, which served Lebreton Station. The Transitway was replaced by the Confederation Line light rail, which opened on September 14, 2019. As of the Canada 2006 Census, 57 people were living in LeBreton Flats. The portion of LeBreton Flats that had been expropriated and left vacant in the 1960s welcomed its first residents in 2008, as the first condominium building constructed in the first phase of the redevelopment neared completion.Kelly Egan, \\"Early inhabitants revel in the city life\\" . Ottawa Citizen. October 17, 2008. Retrieved October 17, 2008. =RendezVous LeBreton = In 2015, the NCC put out a request for submissions to redevelop the south and south-western sections of LeBreton Flats, north of Albert Street, in size. Four groups submitted proposals: * RendezVous LeBreton Group - a partnership of the Ottawa Senators and Trinity Developments * Claridge Homes * Devcore Group * Focus Equities In April 2016, the NCC selected the RendezVous LeBreton proposal, which included 4,000 housing units, park space, a recreation facility with services for the disabled, a library (just off the defined redevelopment lands) and a new arena for the Ottawa Senators team in the NHL. A completion date was not announced. In January 2018, the NCC reached an agreement with RendezVous to redevelop LeBreton Flats in a two-phase operation. However, before construction could begin a conflict between the development consortium parties led to that project being cancelled by the National Capital Commission, who then conducted a new series of public consultations which resulted in a new Preliminary Master Concept Plan being approved in January 2020. The plan divided the undeveloped land into four sectors, with the intention of determining, in the first half of 2020, the order in which the various parcels of land will be developed, and parks and public spaces created.  Pooley's Bridge  Pooley's Bridge Pooley's Bridge (), Ottawa's oldest bridge, is a stone arch bicycle/pedestrian bridge located in LeBreton Flats east of the Canadian War Museum and south of the Portage Bridge. The three span closed spandrel stone arch structure, built in 1873, was designated as a heritage structure by the City of Ottawa in 1994. It is located beside the Fleet Street Pumping Station (Ottawa's original water works) at the end of Fleet Street. The bridge is located at 9 Fleet Street, at the southwest edge of Bronson Park. It is very near and southeast of LeBreton Flats' first new condo unit. It is south (but beyond some grassy area) of where Wellington Street meets the Portage Bridge. The city describes it as \\"over the channel tailrace of the Fleet Street Pumping Station\\". The City waterworks building, including the pumping station and the aqueduct were designated as heritage in 1982 under the Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act. Pooley's Bridge is one of six stone arch bridges in the Lebreton Flats, all built circa 1873. All are Heritage Bridges and are designated to serve as pedestrian/bicycle facilities only. The five other bridges are all single span stone arch bridges over the aqueduct, west of Pooley's Bridge. They are: Canada Central Railway Bridge, Broad Street Bridge, Lloyd Street Bridge, Grand Trunk Railway Bridge and Lett Street Bridge. The first bridge is owned by the National Capital Commission; the second, third and fifth by the City of Ottawa; and the fourth bridge is under the Region's ownership. The third, fourth and fifth bridges are connected. The condition of Pooley's Bridge has been of concern for a number of years. It was necessary to undertake the controlled removal operations on the bridge in 1994, to ensure public safety. Due to anticipated failures, the City of Ottawa filed an Application to Alter and make repairs to five other stone arch bridges in the area in 1999. The repairs required at the five stone arch bridges were relatively minor, but expensive. Pooley's Bridge in Bytown, an earlier bridge, was built in 1836 by Lieutenant Henry Pooley and assigned by Colonel John By who gave it the name after seeing the unpeeled log structure. The bridge was on the road from Wellington and Bank en route to the Union Bridge (see Chaudière Bridge). It was between Upper Town and LeBreton Flats, and appeared in a Chesterton painting.  Tailrace whitewater course  Downstream of Pooley's Bridge and the Pumphouse lies the Tailrace. The Ottawa River Runners made the Tailrace into a Class 2 whitewater course with natural and artificial obstacles for competitions and practice.  Bluesfest  The Ottawa Bluesfest music festival takes place at Lebreton Flats annually. Performances by many famous and local musicians occur during this 12-day music festival in the month of July.

Model of an Arado Ar 234 V21 carrying an Arado E.381 Kleinstjäger – \\"smallest fighter\\" The Emergency Fighter Program () was the program that resulted from a decision taken on July 3, 1944 by the Luftwaffe regarding the German aircraft manufacturing companies during the last year of the Third Reich. The Do 335 was the only piston- engined fighter allowed to go forward under the Jägernotprogramm. This project was one of the products of the latter part of 1944, when the Luftwaffe High Command saw that there was a dire need for a strong defense against Allied bombing raids. Although opposed by important figures such as Luftwaffe fighter force leader Adolf Galland, the project went ahead owing to the backing of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.The Heinkel He-162 Volksjaeger Most of the designs of the Emergency Fighter Program never proceeded past the project stage.Heinkel He P.1077 (Julia) Rocket-Powered Interceptor - History History 1944 opened with massive bombing raids by the US Army Air Force and RAF Bomber Command on a scale not seen before. With a shift of emphasis from targeting strategic targets to the destruction of the Luftwaffe, during the Big Week in late February 1944 the Luftwaffe fighter force was broken. Attempts to address this failed, and by the summer, Allied planes were roaming at will over most of Germany. Jet fighters like the Messerschmitt Me 262, at that time about to enter service, had a clear performance advantage over the Allied aircraft but were expensive and difficult to keep operational. This led to the idea of a much less expensive design that could be easily built and so inexpensive that any extensive problems would be addressed by simply disposing of the aircraft. This became the genesis of the Emergency Fighter Program as part of shifting production to defensive interceptor/fighters. A number of new aircraft design competition programmes were launched to provide new jet fighters. Production of the Messerschmitt Me 262A fighter versions continued, as well as the development of advanced piston-engined fighters such as the Dornier Do 335 as per Hitler's personal request on May 23, 1944, before the July 3 announcement of the program. Bomber designs powered by piston engines were severely curtailed or outright cancelled, with only jet bombers allowed to continue in production, such as the Arado Ar 234. New jet bombers such as the Junkers Ju 287 and Heinkel He 343 were worked on fitfully as low priority projects in the last months of the war. Towards the end of the war in the design of the planes little thought was given to the safety or comfort of the pilots who were mostly Hitler Youth motivated by fanaticism. Some of the fighters, such as the Heinkel P.1077 Julia, the Blohm & Voss BV 40 and the Arado E.381 Kleinstjäger – \\"smallest fighter\\" were designed with the pilot flying the aircraft in a prone position. Powered by rockets, certain designs were a blend of \\"aircraft and projectile\\" in the words of Nazi propaganda, with a vertical takeoff like a missile launch system attempted for the first time in a manned aircraft, such as the Bachem Ba 349 Natter —in which the test-pilot died in the first flight. The Natter and Julia designs were expected to climb to their ceiling at vertical or near vertical angles, while the Arado design was a parasite aircraft that needed to be carried by a \\"mother\\" plane, with the unpowered BV 40 needing an aerotow into action. These small interceptors had fuel for only a few minutes for combat action and landing was fraught with hazards, for after spending the rocket fuel the center of gravity would shift substantially making the aircraft difficult to handle at best and uncontrollable at worst. In the Natter or in the Fliegende Panzerfaust the pilot had to bail out at the end of a mission while the rear fuselage containing the rocket motor descended under its own parachute. Other designs, such as the Focke-Wulf Volksjäger 2, sought to overcome this problem by means of a very short fuselage design. Instead of having a wheeled undercarriage most rocket-powered planes that were able to land had only a fixed skid. Such simplified and dangerous planes were the products of the last phase of the Third Reich, when the lack of materials and the dire need for a strong defense against the Allied bombing raids required such craft to be built quickly in underground factories. During this period the Nazi authorities also considered the use of selbstopfer (suicide) planes such as the Reichenberg (a manned version of the V-1 flying bomb), and in one case of actual use, a \\"special detachment\\" unit dedicated to desperate aerial ramming tactics, known as Sonderkommando Elbe. =Peoples' Fighter Project= In August 1944, a requirement led to the Volksjäger (\\"Peoples' Fighter\\") aircraft design competition, to create a lightweight high-speed fighter/interceptor using a single BMW 003 turbojet engine as specified,Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.145. intended for rapid mass-production while using minimal resources. The Volksjäger was intended to be disposable, with damaged aircraft being discarded rather than repaired, while it was to be flown by pilots hastily trained on gliders. After a hurried design competition involving almost all of Germany's aircraft companies, including Zeppelin with its Fliegende Panzerfaust, Heinkel's He 162 proposal was selected as the winning Volksjäger airframe design.Smith and Kay 1972, pp. 307–308. The first prototype of the He 162 Spatz (Sparrow), flew in December 1944.Smith and Kay 1972, p.308. Other designs submitted to the Peoples' Fighter Programme, such as the Blohm & Voss P 211, were potentially superior, but never proceeded past the project stage. =Miniature Fighter Project= In November 1944, a programme for an even simpler fighter, the so-called Miniaturjägerprogramm (\\"Miniature Fighter Program\\") was launched. The aim was to develop and mass-produce a very small interceptor using the absolute minimum of strategic materials. Linked to Nazi propaganda, stress was laid on producing the fighter planes cheaply and in large numbers so as to overwhelm the Allied bomber formations that flew daily over Germany. The Miniaturjäger would be powered by one Argus As 014 pulsejet engine per unit, as this engine required far fewer construction man-hours, than the 375 man-hoursChristopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.75. needed to build a Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet.Smith and Kay 1972, p.614. The various German aircraft designers showed less interest in this new enterprise than in the Peoples' Fighter Project for the imminent He 162 program would swallow up most of what was left of the country's available — and rapidly diminishing — production capacity. Furthermore, it was already well known by the time the Miniaturjäger competition was announced that, as they didn't produce enough power at low speeds for takeoff, the Argus pulsejets were unsuitable for manned aircraft that would have to takeoff unassisted. Since additional launch schemes would have to be added to the project, such as towplanes, catapults or rocket boosters, the goal of the program would be defeated as complexity and expense would be far higher. Thus the Miniaturjäger project never saw mass-production, being abandoned by December 1944. Even so, aircraft manufacturers Heinkel, Blohm & Voss and Junkers came up with light fighter designs using a strict minimum of materials before that date. The resulting planes were small, spartan creations, with no radio and almost no electrical equipment, Heinkel would use a He 162 air frame powered by a pulse jet, Blohm & Voss designed the BV P 213 and Junkers would submit the Ju EF 126 Elli project. The only Miniature Fighter aircraft to get beyond blueprint status was the Junkers EF 126. Although unbuilt during the war, five prototypes were built in the Dessau Junkers plant in the area occupied by the Soviet Union. One of the prototypes was destroyed during unpowered testing in 1946, killing the pilot.Junkers Ef-126 \\"Lilli\\" =Other projects= At the beginning of 1945 a further programme was launched by the OKL in order to replace the He 162 Volksjäger. The new aircraft was intended to have superior performance in order to deal with future high altitude threats such as the B-29 Superfortress, which eventually never saw action in Europe owing to the end of the war.Sternenbanner announcement of the B-29 in German, comparing it to the B-17 in size To meet this requirement, power was to be a single Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet, of which only 19 examples were ever produced, and all allocated for development testing.

Discussing Theodor Adorno, Max defines surrealist music as that which \\"juxtaposes its historically devalued fragments in a montage- like manner which enables them to yield up new meanings within a new aesthetic unity,\\" though Lloyd Whitesell says this is Paddison's gloss of the term . Anne cites automatism, including improvisation, and collage as the primary techniques of musical surrealism. According to Whitesell, Paddison quotes Adorno's 1930 essay \\"Reaktion und Fortschritt\\" as saying \\"Insofar as surrealist composing makes use of devalued means, it uses these as devalued means, and wins its form from the 'scandal' produced when the dead suddenly spring up among the living\\" . Early surrealist music In the 1920s several composers were influenced by surrealism, or by individuals in the surrealist movement. The two composers most associated with surrealism during this period were Erik Satie , who wrote the score for the ballet Parade, causing Guillaume Apollinaire to coin the term surrealism , and George Antheil who wrote that, \\"The Surrealist movement had, from the very beginning, been my friend. In one of its manifestos it had been declared that all music was unbearable—excepting, possibly, mine—a beautiful and appreciated condescension\\" . Adorno cites as the most consequent surrealist compositions those works by Kurt Weill, such as The Threepenny Opera and Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, along with works by others drawn from the middle-period music of Igor Stravinsky—most particularly that of L'Histoire du soldat—and defines this surrealism as a hybrid form between the \\"modern\\" music of Arnold Schoenberg and his school, and the \\"objectivist\\" neoclassicism/folklorism of the later Stravinsky. This surrealism, like objectivism, recognizes alienation but is more socially alert. It thereby denies itself the positivist notions of objectivism, which are recognised as illusion. Its content deals instead with \\"permitting social flaws to manifest themselves by means of flawed invoice, which defines itself as illusory with no attempts at camouflage through attempts at an aesthetic totality\\" , thereby destroying aesthetic formal immanence and transcending into the literary realm. This surrealism is further differentiated from a fourth type of music, the so-called Gebrauchsmusik of Paul Hindemith and Hanns Eisler, which attempts to break through alienation from within itself, even at the expense of its immanent form . The early works of musique concrète by Pierre Schaeffer have a surrealist character owing to the unexpected juxtaposition of sound objects, such as the sounds of Balinese priests chanting, a barge on the River Seine, and rattling saucepans in Etude aux casseroles (1948). The composer Olivier Messiaen referred to the \\"surrealist anxiety\\" of Schaeffer's early work in contrast to the \\"asceticism\\" of the later Etude aux allures of 1958 . After the first concert of musique concrète (Concert de bruits, October 5, 1948) Schaeffer received a letter from one member of the audience (identified only as G. M.) describing it as \\"the music heard, by themselves alone, by Poe and Lautréamont, and Raymond Roussel. The concert of noises represents not only the first concert of surrealist music, but also contains, in my view, a musical revolution\\" . Schaeffer himself argued that musique concrète, in its initial phase, tended either towards atonality or surrealism, or both, rather than, as it subsequently became, the starting point of a more general musical procedure .

History According to an old story, Bentong was previously known as Carlo Sas. It was changed from Papi to Bentong before World War I. In earlier times, the center of Bentong was around the market area, at the meeting point of the Chongki rivers Repas and Perting. The most important transportation way at that time was the rivers by using perahu (small boats). The jetty was situated in front of current rest house (near current Bentong Police Station). Bentong became a focal point when tin ore was discovered in the two main rivers, Repas and Perting. Tin developers constructed ‘ban’ to extract more ore, hence more profits. The practice became a talking matter to the people outside Bentong, who referred to it as the story of ‘ban untung’ (the Profitable Ban). ‘Ban Untung’ became more well-known than Kapong that later people began to call it Ban Untung. From the name ‘Ban Untung’ was what the name for the district of Bentong derived from. From other story, according to Pak Zek (Budayawan Dato’ Haji Zakaria bin Hitam), the name Bentong originated from ‘Bapong’ (meaning float). Bentong was once used as a fort by Dato’ Bahaman. The British army sent over the Gurkhas mercenary to defeat Dato’ Bahaman to take over the area. However, a number of the Gurkhas were killed after they were ambushed by Dato’ Bahaman’s men. Their bodies were thrown into the river and floated in the water. Following the incident, the site was known as Bapong, and later known as Bentong. The exact date of the name change was on 31 August 1957.

Commonly nicknamed \\"White Rose\\", he was the last Yorkist claimant to actively and openly seek the crown of England. He lived in exile after many of his relatives were executed, becoming allied with Louis XII of France in the War of the League of Cambrai. Louis saw him as a more favourable ally and prospect for an English king than Henry VIII. During 1514, the stage was set for a Yorkist reclaiming of England under Richard. He was in Brittany with 12,000 mercenaries set for the invasion, leading his army to St. Malo; however, France and England made peace just as they were about to embark and it was thus called off. Later, with Francis I as king, Richard struck up an alliance in 1523 and planned a Yorkist invasion of England once again. However, this never came to fruition, as Richard died fighting alongside Francis I at the Battle of Pavia two years later. Family He was the seventh and youngest son of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk and his wife Elizabeth of York. His mother was the elder of the two surviving daughters of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville. She was also a younger sister to Edward IV of England and Edmund, Earl of Rutland as well as an older sister to Margaret of York, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence and Richard III of England. His paternal grandparents were William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk and Alice Chaucer. Suffolk was an important English soldier and commander in the Hundred Years' War, and later Lord Chamberlain of England. He also appears prominently in William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 1 and Henry VI, Part 2. Alice Chaucer was a daughter of Thomas Chaucer and Maud Burghersh. Thomas was the Speaker of the English House of Commons on three occasions, Chief Butler of England for almost thirty years, attended fifteen parliaments and was Speaker of the House five times, a feat not surpassed until the 18th century. Thomas was a son of Geoffrey Chaucer and his wife Philippa (de) Roet. Geoffrey was an English author, poet, philosopher, bureaucrat (courtier) and diplomat. He is sometimes called the father of English literature. Although he wrote many works, he is best remembered for his unfinished frame narrative The Canterbury Tales. He is also credited by some scholars with being the first author to demonstrate the artistic legitimacy of the vernacular English language, rather than French or Latin. Yorkist heir His eldest brother John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln (c. 14641487), may have been named heir to the throne by his maternal uncle, Richard III of England, who gave him a pension and the reversion of the estates of Lady Margaret Beaufort. However, on the accession of Henry VII following the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Lincoln took the oath of allegiance instead of claiming the throne for himself. In 1487, Lincoln joined the rebellion of Lambert Simnel and was killed at the Battle of Stoke. The second brother, Edmund (c. 14711513), succeeded his father while still in his minority. His estates suffered under the attainder of his brother, and he was compelled to pay large sums to Henry VII for the recovery of part of the forfeited lands, and also to exchange his title of duke for that of earl. In 1501 he sought out Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, in Tyrol and received from him a promise of substantial assistance in case of an attempt on the English crown. In consequence of these treasonable proceedings Henry VII seized Edmund's brother William, with four other Yorkist noblemen. Two of them, Sir James Tyrrell and Sir John Wyndham, were executed; William de la Pole was imprisoned; and Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, was outlawed. Then in July 1502 Henry VII concluded a treaty with Maximilian by which the Emperor bound himself not to countenance English rebels. Presently Suffolk fell into the hands of Philip I of Castile, who imprisoned him at Namur and in 1506 surrendered him to Henry VII, on condition that his life was spared. He remained a prisoner until 1513, when he was beheaded by Henry VIII at the time his brother Richard took up arms with the French king. Richard de la Pole joined Edmund abroad in 1504, and remained at Aix-la-Chapelle as surety for his elder brother's debts. The creditors threatened to surrender him to Henry VII but, more fortunate than his brother, he found a safe refuge at Buda with King Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary. He was excluded from the general pardon proclaimed at the accession of Henry VIII, and when Louis XII of France went to war with the Kingdom of England in 1512, he recognised Edmund's pretensions to the English crown and gave Richard a command in the French army. In 1513, after the execution of Edmund, he assumed the title of Earl of Suffolk. In 1514 he was given 12,000 German mercenaries, ostensibly for the defence of Brittany, but really for an invasion of England. These he led to St. Malo, but the conclusion of peace with England prevented their embarcation. Richard was required to leave France, and he established himself at Metz, in Lorraine, and built a palace at La Haute Pierre, near St. Simphorien. While at Metz, he was visited by Pierre Alamire, the German- Netherlandish composer and music copyist, who was a spy for Henry VIII. However, Richard employed Alamire as a counter-spy against Henry, and Alamire, on being suspected of unreliability by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and Henry VIII, never returned to England. Richard de la Pole had numerous interviews with King Francis I of France, and in 1523 he was permitted, in concert with John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany, the Scottish regent, to arrange an invasion of England, which was never carried out. He was with Francis I at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, where he was killed.R.J.Knecht, Francis I, (Cambridge University Press, 1982), 169–170. In a picture of the battle, preserved at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, his lifeless body is represented in the thick of the combat with the inscription Le Duc de Susfoc dit Blance Rose (The Duke of Suffolk, known as White Rose). Children Richard de la Pole was never known to have married, but he is known to have had a daughter by a mistress.perhaps the wife of a goldsmith during his stay in Metz see F. des Robert:Un pensionnaire des Rois de France à Metz , published at Nancy in 1878 It has been suggested that she may have been Marie of Sicily. *Marguerite de la Pole who was lady of honour to Marguerite of Angoulême, Queen of Navarre. On 21 May 1539, Marguerite de la Pole signed a marriage contract to Sibeud de Tivoley, seigneur de Brenieu, in the presence of the Queen and her kinsman Gabriel, Marquis of Saluzzo. Tivoley was esquire ordinaire of Queen Eleanore of Austria. Tivoley was still living in 1547, but died before 1568.

(also called Exciting Pro Wrestling in Japan) is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and released for the PlayStation by THQ. It is based on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and is named after the company's SmackDown! television program. Originally released in March 2000, the game received a direct sequel released several months later, WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role. The first WWF game on the PlayStation to be published by THQ, SmackDown! marked the start of a long running series of WWE video games from THQ, then continued by 2K Sports and rebranded as WWE 2K. The game was also re-released under the Greatest Hits budget range. Gameplay The story mode contains three main parts, first with the Pre-Season (for created wrestlers), but after ten in-game years of playing the Pre-Season, players are allowed to skip it. However, the season mode is nearly impossible to complete. By playing and advancing in the season modes players gain rewards such as unlockables or attires, but instead of unlocking new characters, players unlock new body parts to put on new creations, to play as that \\"unlocked\\" character. Once players build a creation, they must fight in a Pre- Season year to build their skills and make their alliances. Once players finish the Pre-Season, they can never replay it without deleting the custom wrestler, and friends and foes for a creation are set in stone. The story mode contains no voice-overs, instead the characters meet each other backstage with mouths that move to no voice and on-screen cutscene text. The game also lacks play-by-play color commentary. WWF SmackDown! has many match types including Single, Tag Team, Hardcore, Steel Cage and many more. The game features the late 1999 WWF roster following SmackDown!'s premiere including the then- newcomers The Dudley Boyz. Development Yuke's, the developer of SmackDown! had previously created the Toukon Retsuden series of wrestling games in Japan for New Japan Pro Wrestling. Despite this, the game engine used in SmackDown! is not based on contemporary Toukon Retsuden titles, but rather The Pro Wrestling, a title developed by Yuke's as part of D3 Publisher's Simple series and released several months in Japan beforehand. Reception WWF SmackDown! received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. The game was a bestseller in the UK upon release,UK PlayStation sales chart, August 2000, published in Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 61 and again three months later.UK PlayStation sales chart, November 2000, published in Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 64 The PlayStation version of WWF SmackDown! received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

For the valuation of infrastructure assets, the Statement authorized both a standard depreciation approach and a modified approach that relied upon asset management analysis and systems as acceptable methods.

Romero. It stars Lane Carroll, Will MacMillan, and Harold Wayne Jones as residents of a small American town that accidentally becomes afflicted by a military biological weapon. Filmed in Evans City in Western Pennsylvania, The Crazies was a box office failure upon release, but has since become a cult film. A remake of the film was released in 2010. Plot In Evans City, Pennsylvania, a man kills his wife and burns down his farmhouse. Firefighters David, a Green Beret, and Clank, an infantryman, both having served in the Vietnam War, are called to the scene. The man who burned down his home is handcuffed in the back of a police car, ranting hysterically. Meanwhile, David's pregnant girlfriend, a nurse named Judy, is called to the office of Dr. Brookmyre, where the two children of the arsonist are being treated for burns. Heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks arrive in the town, and are being led by Major Ryder, who takes over Dr. Brookmyre's office. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying a bioweapon had crash-landed near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \\"Trixie\\" which is highly contagious and causes victims to either die or become hysterical and homicidally insane. In Washington D.C., government officials order Colonel Peckem to go to Evans City to help contain the virus, while scientist Dr. Watts is brought in to develop a cure. Martial law is declared in Evans City and a quarantine is placed on the town. Army soldiers forcibly move the townspeople into a high school, rousting many from their homes, and shoot anyone attempting to escape. Bombers armed with nuclear weapons are dispatched to destroy the town if necessary. In one house, a soldier encounters an elderly woman who stabs him with her knitting needle. A group of soldiers are killed by a mob armed with guns and dynamite, after which an infected woman happily sweeps the blood-soaked grass. A local priest, upset at the soldiers rousting his flock, douses himself with gasoline and sets himself on fire. David, Judy, Clank, teenager Kathy Fulton, her father Artie, and a sick man named Frank are confined to a large van by the soldiers. The van is attacked by infected people, and the soldiers try to fight them off. Frank wanders off, muttering, and is captured by the soldiers. Clank and David commandeer the van, and the five of them try to find a way to escape the town, spending the night hiding in a building of a country club. The next day, the group attempts to escape by traveling through the nearby woods, fighting off soldiers both on the ground and in an overhead helicopter. Later that day, they come across a house occupied by a handful of soldiers and David and Clank kill the sentries outside the house and hold three of the soldiers inside the house at gunpoint. One of the soldiers discloses what he knows about the virus to David, but when one of the soldiers reaches for his gun, Clank opens fire and kills the soldiers. David confides in Judy what he knows about the virus and tells her that Kathy, Artie, and probably Clank are infected. Going insane from the effects of virus, Artie attempts to rape Kathy. Discovering the pair, Clank beats Artie, who then apparently hangs himself and the next morning, a shaken Kathy wanders outside and is killed by soldiers. Believing himself to be infected, Clank kills several soldiers before being shot in the head, allowing David and Judy to escape. That evening, Judy, now visibly infected, is killed by armed civilians. One of the civilians recognizes David and identifies himself as a fellow firefighter, also uninfected and trying to escape. Angry and frightened, David surrenders to the military. After being taken into custody, David eventually realizes that he is immune to the virus, but he keeps the knowledge to himself. During all of this, the soldiers isolate Dr. Watts in the high school where the infected are being corralled, allowing him to use the simple chemistry lab inside. Watts insists that he might find a cure in a proper laboratory but is not granted access to one, and when Watts develops and goes to share a possible cure he is mistaken for one of the infected and forced into quarantine by the soldiers. The test tubes containing the possible vaccine are shattered after the doctor is pushed down a flight of stairs by a stampede of infected persons and is killed... along with the knowledge of a possible cure. In the final scenes, a distraught Colonel Peckem is ordered to relocate to Louisville, where symptoms of the virus have been reported. After passing a medical test, he boards a helicopter and departs.

The script dealt with a military bioweapon that was accidentally released into a small town, with the military subsequently trying to cover up the incident and the townspeople revolting. Romero revealed that the military subplot was only featured in the first act of the script, and the rest of the film focused on the survivors and their attempts to cope with what was happening. The director called McCollough's script \\"very existential and heady\\". The screenplay was read by Lee Hessel, a producer who owned Cambist Films and with whom Romero had previously worked on There's Always Vanilla. Hessel expressed interest in it and offered to finance it as Romero's next film, but only if the director would be willing to rewrite McCollough's screenplay to focus on what Hessel considered the most interesting ingredient of the story, namely the military takeover of the town, which occurred in the first 10 to 20 pages. Romero agreed and rewrote the script, and he was given a budget of approximately $270,000. The film was shot in and around Evans City and Zelienople, both small towns in Pennsylvania about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. Romero has spoken of how the majority of people in the towns were very cooperative and happy to help with the production. On February 23, 2010, the film was released on Blu-ray by Blue Underground, the same company who first issued a DVD release on April 29, 2003. It was later re-released with a new 4K restoration by Arrow Video as part of a boxset entitled George A. Romero: Between Night and Dawn. It was later released separately on March 13, 2018. Reception=Box office= The film did not have a wide release, instead playing in a limited number of theaters before opening in a different market. Romero later claimed he felt that the major reason The Crazies failed at the box office was due to poor distribution. He stated that Hessel made a true attempt to adequately market the film, including releasing it under a variety of titles in different parts of the country, but that it never managed to catch the public's eye. =Critical reception= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Crazies holds an approval rating of 65% with an average rating of 5.44/10, based on 23 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Crazies isn't top-shelf Romero, but its blend of genre thrills and social subtext should still be enough to satisfy discerning horror fans.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 6 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" See also * List of American films of 1973 ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1973 films Category:1973 horror films Category:1973 independent films Category:American action horror films Category:American films Category:American disaster films Category:American independent films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:Films about viral outbreaks Category:Films directed by George A.

It is the flagship law journal of the University of Michigan Law School and one of the top law journals in the United States.  History  The Michigan Law Review was established in 1902, after Gustavus Ohlinger, a student in the Law Department (now the Law School) of the University of Michigan, approached the dean with a proposal for a law journal. The Michigan Law Review was originally intended as a forum in which the faculty of the Law Department could publish its legal scholarship. The faculty resolution creating the Michigan Law Review required every faculty member to submit two articles per year to the new journal. From its inception until 1940, the Michigan Law Review's student members worked under the direction of faculty members who served as editor-in-chief. The first of these was Floyd Mechem, the last Paul Kauper. In 1940, the first student editor-in- chief was selected. During the years that followed, student editors were given increasing responsibility and autonomy; today, the Michigan Law Review is run with no faculty supervision. The current editor-in-chief is Sophia Montgomery. Day-to-day production operations are overseen by the current managing editor, Alexander Bau, and executive production editor, Loren Lee. Seven of each volume's eight issues ordinarily are composed of two major parts: \\"Articles\\" by legal scholars and practitioners and \\"Notes\\" written by the student editors. One issue in each volume is devoted to book reviews. Occasionally special issues are devoted to symposia or colloquia.  Rankings  In 2016, PrawfsBlawg ranked the Michigan Law Review as the 6th best law journal by weighing its Google Scholar Metrics law journal ranking, US News Peer Reputation Ranking, US News Overall Ranking, and the W&L; Combined Ranking. Based on data from 2009 through 2016, Washington and Lee University School of Law ranked the Michigan Law Review as the 7th best law journal. According to Google Scholar Metrics, the Michigan Law Review was the 7th best law journal in 2015 and the 6th best law journal in 2014. According to Washington and Lee University School of Law's Law Library, the Michigan Law Review is the 7th most cited law journal in academic works, being cited in journals 3888 times between 2009 and 2016, and the 6th most cited law journal by courts, being cited in 128 cases between 2009 and 2016. As of 2012, the Michigan Law Review has published 4 of the 100 most cited law journal articles of all time—the 5th highest of any law journal.http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&context;=mlr Of the 95 articles that constitute the 5 most cited law journal articles from each year between 1991 and 2009, 9 of them were published by the Michigan Law Review—the 5th most of any law journal.

It is situated in Dalarna, 200 kilometres north-west of Stockholm. Background In 2015, the university had 16,344 students, with 11,642 of them studying via distance education. The campuses are located in Falun, the administrative capital of the province, and in the neighbouring town of Borlänge. Dalarna University is deemed qualified to award Phd degrees in Microdata Analysis following assessment by The Swedish National Agency for Higher Education. Research in Complex Systems and Microdata Analysis at Borlänge campus is carried out in collaboration with business and industry, and increases the competitiveness for trade, IT, transport and tourism in the region. Research in this subject area accounts for some 35 million SEK at the university. The field has some 50 employed researchers and teachers at the Borlänge campus and on top of that a further 30 doctoral students who are able to complete their education at Dalarna University. = Locus student accommodation = Student accommodation area Locus is located in Tjärna Ängar, a district in Borlänge designated by Swedish police as a vulnerable area, a socially deprived area with a higher crime rate. This makes life insecure for in particular female students who avoid walking alone at night due to persistent harassment. Therefore, the student union recommends relocating the campus to Falun. In September 2020, the student union criticized the university board for placing international students in Tjärna Ängar, as foreign students expected to experience Swedish culture and traditions of Dalarna, but instead questioned whether they lived in Sweden at all since they never hear the Swedish language and instead think they live in a segregated neighbourhood. The union criticized that Tjärna Ängar was an area with a very high illiteracy, poverty and unemployment rates and low levels of education compared to other areas of Borlänge and that students had experience thefts, burglaries, stabbings and been harassed. As a result several students moved back to their country of origin or chose to pursue the courses online.

She published poetry for adults and children as well as travel books, short stories and essays. In her later years, she also did extensive work in translation. Biography Dora Gabe was the daughter of Peter Gabe, an immigrant from Russia, who became the first Jew to be elected to the Bulgarian National Assembly. When he was barred from taking office, he turned to journalism and became a well known public figure in Bulgaria. Dora attended high school in Varna, and then pursued a degree in Natural Sciences at Sofia University (1904). Later, she studied French Philology in Geneva and Grenoble (1905–1906). She taught French in Dobrich (1907). From 1911 to 1932, she resided abroad in Poland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, The Czech Republic, France, The United Kingdom with her husband Prof. Boyan Penev. In the 1920s and 1930s, she gave numerous lectures on political and cultural issues such as the development of Bulgarian literature and the fate of the Dobruja region.

She also served as the editor of the children's magazine \\"Window\\" (1939–1941). Dora Gabe was one of the founders of the Bulgarian-Polish Committee (1922) and the Bulgarian PEN Club (1927). She served as a longtime president for the latter. She was counselor for cultural affairs at the Bulgarian Embassy in Warsaw (1947–1950), and a representative of Bulgaria in the International Congress of PEN clubs. In 1968, she was awarded the title \\"Honorary citizen of the city Tolbuhin\\". She is widely regarded as one of the most successful Bulgarian poets and is beloved by Bulgarians not only for her work but for her deep respect for all arts and her charitable spirit. A popular anecdote claims that after the 9 September coup d'état, partisans were sent to live in Gabe's apartment. The poet moved to her sister's unfinished villa where she had to sleep with a coat under the blankets, because there was no heating, and had to turn on the stove to warm her hands in order to be able to write. Later in life, Gabe opens her an apartment as a home to all young poet seeking where they can live and create. Literary career Photo of young Dora Gabe In 1900 in Shumen, she published one of her first poems called \\"Spring\\" in the literary journal \\"Youth\\".

Garner spent over two decades as a nationally syndicated overnight disc jockey, first hosting After Midnite for Premiere Networks and then The Blair Garner Show for Nash FM; in-between, he hosted the morning drive time program America's Morning Show, also for Nash FM. As a radio host and DJ, he won the Academy of Country Music's On-Air Personality of the Year award in 2004 and 2006. Garner has also been nominated for the prestigious Marconi Award and for Nationally Syndicated Air Personality by Billboard Magazine. Over his career, Garner has worked at stations across the country, including Dallas, Washington, D.C., Houston, New York City and Los Angeles. He has also used the names \\"Skye Walker\\" (in New York) and \\"Blair Michaels\\" (in Los Angeles). The radio shows Garner's programs focus on country music hits, along with recent music news and chat about pop culture. In addition, Garner is recognized as one of Nashville's best interviewers. Country music's top stars, including Garth Brooks, Taylor Swift, Tim McGraw, Blake Shelton, and Reba McEntire have made it a point to appear on Blair's show to promote their projects. Garner has also interviewed stars outside of Nashville, including Pharrell Williams,Pete Buttigieg,Zendaya,Pete Wentz,Kevin Costner, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lionel Richie, Henry Winkler, Joan Rivers, Kathie Lee Gifford, and WWE and UFC stars such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena and Brock Lesnar. From 1993 to 2013, Garner hosted a show he created called After Midnite. The show amassed an affiliate base of over 300 American and Canadian cities. After three years of ownership, he sold the program to Premiere Networks. In 2009, Garner moved the show from Los Angeles to Nashville where he hosted the show until 2013, when he left to helm \\"America's Morning Show\\" for Cumulus Media. That show launched initially in New York City on WNSH (New York City's Nash FM affiliate). Cumulus Media (whose syndication company Westwood One competes with Premiere) then took the morning show, into national syndication.Hinckley, David. Life from Nashville, it's a New York morning show. New York Daily News. Retrieved July 5, 2013. In 2016, Garner's stepped away from the grueling demands of morning drive, and elected to return to his former overnight time slot with \\"The Blair Garner Show\\". Garner made the move after his young daughter complained of his work interfering with their family life. In 2019, Cumulus Media blocked Garner from airing an interview with 2020 Democratic Party candidate Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg is the first major party presidential candidate in a same-sex marriage. While Garner has discussed the challenges of his coming out to a country radio audience, he said that was not part of his interview with Buttigieg.WashingtonPost.com \\"Buttigieg Interview with Popular Country Radio Host Won't Air\\" July 22, 2019 Garner instead put the interview on SoundCloud. In July 2020, Westwood One announced that Garner's show was being cancelled, as part of a much-larger programming restructure. The show was last broadcast on August 9, 2020. Once that news broke, Garner was then free to announce what he and his husband had been working on for two years behind the scenes -- The Mulehouse. The Mulehouse is slated for an April 2021 opening, and is heralded to be the first-of-its-kind music/concert venue designed for worldwide live-streaming events. http://musicrow.com/2020/07/blair-garner-to-open-new-entertainment-venue-the- mulehouse/ Awards Garner has nine Billboard Broadcast awards, three Academy of Country Music’s “On-Air Personality of the Year” Awards in the national category (2004, 2006 and 2010).

He held this position from 1845 until his death in 1853. His rule was a short period of relative peace and prosperity between the violent reigns of his father and his son. Background German map of the region c. 1861 (Massina to the east) Masina is the Inner Niger Delta, a large area where the Niger River divides into separate channels that overflow and flood the land annually. Some time between 1810 and 1818 Seku Amadu Lobbo of the Bari family launched a jihad against the Fulbe chiefs in Masina, tributaries of the pagan Bambara of Segu, whom he accused of idolatry. The goals of the jihad soon expanded to that of conquest of the Bambara and others in the region. Seku Amadu established a large empire based on Hamdallahi, which he had founded as the capital. The empire stretched from just downstream of Segu almost all the way to Timbuktu. Seku Amadu Lobbo received support from Tukolor and Fula people who were seeking independence from the Bambara, but met resistance when he imposed a rigorous Islamic theocracy based on the Maliki interpretation of Sharia law. The new theocratic state was ruled by a council of forty elders, who gave directions to provincial governors. Most of the governors were related to Seku Amadu. Rule Seku Amadu Lobbo died on 19 March 1845 and his eldest son, also Amadu, was elected as almami. Technically, the new almami did not have to be a member of the Bari family, but only someone who was learned and pious. There were several candidates, including Ba Lobbo, the son of Seku Amadu's oldest brother. Election of Ba Lobbo would have followed the Bari family tradition of succession through a collateral line rather than direct succession. Others such as Alfa Nuhum Tayru and al-Hadjdj Mody Seydu were better qualified, although not related to the former almami. However, the council chose the son as almami, while Ba Lobbo became the main leader of the state's army. At the start of his rule, Amadu II (Amadu Seku) had to suppress internal opposition. He also faced revolts by the Saro Bambara and the Tuareg around Timbuktu, who declared independence. Ba Lobbo defeated the Tuareg with a surprise attack near Lake Gossi early in 1846. In 1847 the local Kunta leader, Sidi al-Bekkai, managed to persuade Amadu to withdraw his military garrison from Timbuktu, but had to accept Masina rule. Amadu was also able to suppress the Bambara revolt. Amadu's rule was a time of relative peace and prosperity compared to those of his father and his son, building on his father's achievement in persuading the formerly nomadic Fula people to settle, and in establishing a strong legal framework for grazing and transhumance rights. However, Amadu found it hard to maintain the level of enthusiasm for strict Islamic rule that his father had achieved. Ahmadu II was killed during a raid on the Bambara. He died in February 1853. His tomb may still be seen in Hamdallahi, along with that of his father, in the ruins of the palace. Succession Amadu II nominated his son, also Amadu, as his successor. In 1853, Amadu III was elected to the position of Almami in accordance with his father's wishes. Amadu III was handicapped by dissension over his succession within the Bari family, and was never secure in his authority. Ahmadu III was defeated on 15 May 1862 by the jihadist el Hadj Umar Tall, who occupied Hamdallahi. The Masina Empire had lasted little more than forty years.

Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case limiting punitive damages under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Facts The plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW, and later discovered that the vehicle had been repainted before he bought it. Defendant BMW of North America revealed that their policy was to sell damaged cars as new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3% of the cost of the car. Dr. Gore sued, and an Alabama jury awarded $4,000 in compensatory damages (lost value of the car) and $4 million in punitive damages, which was later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. The punitive damages resulted not only from Dr. Gore's damages, but from BMW's egregious behavior across a broad spectrum of BMW purchasers over a multi-year period of time in which BMW repaired damaged vehicles and sold them as new to unsuspecting buyers as a matter of routine business operation.{L. Andrew Goggans, M.A.} The decision of the Alabama Supreme Court was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Issue Whether excessively high punitive damages violate the Due Process clause of the Constitution. Opinion of the Court The Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, found that the excessively high punitive damages in this case violate the Due Process clause. For punitive damages to stand, the damages must be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State's legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. Punitive damages may not be \\"grossly excessive\\" – if they are, then they violate substantive due process. The Supreme Court applied three factors in making this determination: # The degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct; # The ratio to the compensatory damages awarded (actual or potential harm inflicted on the plaintiff); and # Comparison of the punitive damages award and civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct. Using these factors, the Court found that BMW's conduct was not particularly reprehensible (no reckless disregard for health or safety, nor even evidence of bad faith). The ratio of actual or potential damages to punitive damages was suspiciously high. Finally, the criminal sanctions available for similar conduct were limited to $2,000, making the $2 million assessment the equivalent of a severe criminal penalty. The Court noted, however, that these three factors can be over-ridden if it is \\"necessary to deter future conduct\\". Dissenting opinions were written by Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, both contending that the Constitution was not implicated here, raising principles of federalism.  Aftermath  On remand, the Supreme Court of Alabama ordered a new trial unless plaintiff accepted a remittitur of all but $50,000 of the punitive damages awarded.BMW, Inc. v. Gore, 701 So. 2d 507 (Ala. 1997) The court reasoned that it may not have given sufficient weight to the degree of reprehensibility of BMW's conduct, and selected the $50,000 as in the range of other Alabama verdicts in cases of repaired cars being sold as new. Federalism questions In an academic article, following the arguments raised by the dissenting justices, Patrick Hubbard has questioned the appropriateness of federal courts reading substantive rights into the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution in order to preempt the role of state courts and legislatures.F. Patrick Hubbard, \\"In Honor of Walter O. Weyrauch: Substantive Due Process Limits on Punitive Damages Awards: 'Morals With Technique?, 60 Fla. L. Rev. 349, 352 (2008). These same people say the Court should not spend its time as a \\"super jury\\", second-guessing jury verdicts, but rather, \\"[T]he court should be more deferential to state courts and legislatures, and more concerned with developing a coherent framework.\\"  See also  * State Farm v.

The entirety of the route is located in the northwest of Ireland, in County Donegal, connecting Manorcunningham (approx. 10 kilometres outside Letterkenny in the centre of the county) to Lifford in the east. Here it connects to the N15 near the border with Northern Ireland and along the A38 to Strabane in County Tyrone. Route The route commences at the Manorcunningham Roundabout just outside Letterkenny, where the N13 continues north-east towards Derry. The N14 continues south-east past the hamlet of Drumoghill, crosses the R236, continuing through the townlands of Drumbeg and Rossgeir, crossing the Burn Dale, a burn or small river also known as the Burn Deele, at Mulrine's Bridge on the north-western outskirts of Lifford. At Rossgeir, the N14 joins the R265 (connecting St. Johnston) and entering into Lifford from the north. The N15 comes to an end at the western side of a junction with the N14 in the town centre. The latter route, having entered the junction from the south, turns east to end at Lifford Bridge, between Lifford and Strabane (the A38 road continues into Strabane). Previously, the section of road between the Polestar Roundabout (also known as the Port Roundabout) and the Dry Arch Roundabout (which is now classified as the N56) was a part of the N14. Before this, the N56 stretched out to Stranorlar from Letterkenny. Upgrades At present, the section between where the N14 begins and where it ends in Lifford, has not been upgraded. However, a cross-border project has been in the planning since at least 2006, with of 2+1 road planned between the N13/N14 junction and Strabane. This includes work across the border in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, providing an upgraded route onto the current A5. The route is to commence at the N13/N14 junction near Manorcunningham, just south-east of Letterkenny, and proceed southeast, bypassing Lifford to the south and crossing the N15. It will proceed across the River Finn (and international border), to meet the Strabane Bypass portion of the A5. The Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the route was expected to be published in 2006. Following this, oral hearings were expected to be organised by An Bord Pleanála (the Republic of Ireland's planning board) in 2007 as part of the CPO/EIS procedures. It was expected that the design and tender/procurement process would continue into 2008, with construction beginning later that year and ending in 2010. As of 2008, on the National Roads Authority website \\"road scheme activity\\" section, the N14 is stated to be still at \\"Preliminary Design\\" stage.

Such a jury will be composed of jurors who: #Are not categorically opposed to the imposition of capital punishment; #Are not of the belief that the death penalty must be imposed in all instances of capital murder—that is, they would consider life imprisonment as a possible penalty. The creation of such a jury requires the striking during voir dire of jurors who express opposition to the death penalty such that they are unable or unwilling to set aside personal, moral, or emotional objections toward the supporting of a death sentence, and is designed to produce a fair and impartial jury of which the members will fairly consider all options, including the death penalty and life imprisonment. Expressing opposition to the death penalty does not automatically disqualify a juror. A party may attempt to rehabilitate the juror by asking questions as to whether, personal convictions notwithstanding, they might consider the death penalty. A juror who expresses exorbitant support for the death penalty who would thus otherwise be struck may be rehabilitated should they state a willingness to consider life imprisonment. The use of a death-qualified jury was found to be consistent with the United States Constitution, most especially with the Sixth Amendment thereto, by the Supreme Court of the United States in Witherspoon v. Illinois,Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968) and in Lockhart v. McCree;Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162 (1986) neither decision, though, mandated the use of death-qualified juries as against those containing jurors categorically unwilling to impose a penalty of death. It is in view of the Witherspoon decision that the process of one's death-qualifying a jury is, in the United States, referred to colloquially as Witherspooning a jury. A poll commissioned by the Death Penalty Information Center on June 9, 2007, showed 57% of Americans believed they would qualify to be jurors in capital cases.Richard C. Dieter (June 2007) A Crisis of Confidence: Americans' Doubts About the Death Penalty. Death Penalty Information Center  Bias  The bias imposed by the rule goes beyond the application of the death penalty itself. Several studies have found that death-qualified juries are made up of fewer women and minorities. Death- qualified juries are often criticized because they have a similar effect as excluding jurors based on race or gender, which intentional exclusion, in Batson v. Kentucky in 1986, was held as inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Empirical evidence adduced in Lockhart also has shown that death-qualified juries are more likely than other jurors to convict a defendant.. That is, death-qualified jurors are more likely than non-death-qualified jurors to vote for conviction when assessing the same sets of facts. It is argued that since death-qualified juries over represent these groups there is a propensity to render guilty verdicts on cases of any type, including those in which the death penalty is not considered.

(2013) From Rome to Byzantium AD 363 to 565: The Transformation of Ancient Rome. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, pp. 118-119. was a ruler who was a major factor in the Huns' early victories over the Roman Empire. He served as an important forerunner with his brother Octar, with whom he initially ruled in dual kingship, possibly a geographical division where Rugila ruled over Eastern Huns while Octar over Western Huns, during the 5th century AD. Etymology The name is mentioned in three variants, (Rougas), (Rouas), and (Roilas). Common spellings are Ruga, Roas, Rugila. Otto Maenchen-Helfen included this name among those of Germanic or Germanized origin, but without any derivation, only comparison with Rugemirus and Rugolf. Denis Sinor considered a name with initial r- not of Altaic origin (example Ragnaris). Omeljan Pritsak derived it from Old Turkic and considered it to be of composite form, with the change ουγα- > ουα, Greek suffix -ς, and those with ila as Gothicized variant. The Ancient Greek Ρ (Rho) rendered Hunnic *hr-, which is Old Turkic *her > har/ar/er (man), common component of names and titles. Second part ουγα- or ουα resembles Old Turkic title ogä (to think). Thus the reconstruction goes *hēr ögä > *hər ögä > hrögä. History Initially Rugila had ruled together with his brother Octar, who died in 430 during a military campaign against the Burgundians. In 432, Rugila is mentioned as a sole ruler of the Huns. According to Prosper of Aquitaine, \\"After the loss of his office, Aetius lived on his estate. When there some of his enemies by an unexpected attack attempted to seize him, he fled to Rome, and from there to Dalmatia. By the way of Pannonia, he reached the Huns. Through their friendship and help he obtained peace with the rulers and was reinstated in his old office. [] Ruga was ruler of the gens Chunorum\\". Priscus recounts \\"in the land of the Paeonians on the river Sava, which according to the treaty of Aetius, general of the Western Romans, belonged to the barbarian\\", some scholars explain this as meaning that Aetius ceded part of Pannonia Prima to Ruga. Scholars date this cession to 425, 431, or 433. Maenchen-Helfen considered that the area was ceded to Attila. In 422, there was a major Hunnic incursion into Thracia launched from Danube, menacing even Constantinople, which ended with a peace treaty by which Romans had to pay annually 350 pounds of gold. In 432-433, some tribes from Hunnic confederation on the Danube fled to Roman territory and service of Theodosius II. Rugila demanded through his experienced diplomat Esla (Ήσλα, Turkic és-lä, \\"the great, old\\"; later also served Attila) return of all fugitives, otherwise the peace will be terminated, but soon died and was succeeded by sons of his brother Mundzuk, Bleda and Attila, who became joint rulers of the united Hunnic tribes. The Eastern Roman politician Plinta along quaestor Epigenes nevertheless had to go for adverse negotiations at Margus; according to Priscus, it included trade agreement, the annual tribute was raised to 700 pounds of gold, and fugitives were surrendered, among whom two of royal descent, Mamas (Μάμα, Christian name) and Atakam (Άτακάμ, Turkic-Altaic ata- qām, \\"father pagan, priest\\") probably because of conversion to Christianity, were crucified by the Huns at Carso (Hârșova). According to Socrates of Constantinople, Theodosius II prayed to God and managed to obtain what he sought - Ruga was struck dead by a thunderbolt, and among his men followed plague, and fire came down from the heaven consuming his survivors. This text is panegyric on Theodosius II, and happened shortly after 425 AD. Similarly, Theodoret recounts that God helped Theodosius II because he issued a law that ordered destruction of all pagan temples, and Ruga's death was the abundant harvest that followed these good seeds. However, the edict was issued on November 14, 435 AD, so Ruga died after that date. Chronica Gallica of 452 places his death in 434, \\"Aetius is restored to favor. Rugila, king of the Huns, with whom peace was made, dies. Bleda succeeds him\\".

Vasilyevsky Island is separated from Dekabristov Island by the Smolenka River. Together they form the territory of Vasileostrovsky District, an administrative division of Saint Petersburg. Situated just across the river from the Winter Palace, it constitutes a large portion of the city's historic center. Two of the most famous St. Petersburg bridges, Palace Bridge and Blagoveshchensky Bridge, connect it with the mainland to the south. The Exchange Bridge and Tuchkov Bridge across the Malaya Neva connect it with Petrogradsky Island. Vasilyevsky Island is served by Vasileostrovskaya and Primorskaya stations of Saint Petersburg Metro (Line 3 27px). There are plans to build new Metro stations on Vasilyevsky Island by extending Line 4 (the Orange Line) to the Island. In addition, the island is serviced by bus routes and tramway lines. History Originally, planners wanted Vasilyevsky Island to have canals in lieu of streets (similar to Venice). However, this plan never came to fruition and today the island has streets. Etymology Speakers of Russian understand the name of the island as a possessive adjective made of the Russian masculine personal name Vasily (Basil), or possibly of the family name Vasilyev (derived from \\"Vasily\\"). There are various versions of who the original Vasily was, though these may be a product of false etymology, as the Russian name of the island may in fact be a corruption of its previous Swedish or Finnish name, because the island had been shown under them on Swedish maps before its present Russian history began after the Great Northern War. First Russian record of the island, and under virtually its modern name, is found in a registry book of 1500 land survey (Pistsovaya kniga) of Votes' Pyatina (Vodskaya Pyatina) of Novgorod Republic.Васильев остров в устье Невы (Vassilyev island in the mouth of the Neva) It makes less probable another, a later one, Vassily-related etymology dating back to the 18th century. It is connected, like many other city legends, with the person of the founder of the present-day city, Peter the Great. One of his foremost gunner officers and military engineers, some Vassily Korchmin, had his artillery battery to ward off the Swedish navy at the spit of the island and got the tsar's letters addressed \\"To Vassily in the Island\\", thus making it another possible cause of the island's name. The man was commemorated by a lively statue in a pedestrian street in the island (see photo). Finnish etymology may lead to a corrupted compound word Vasikkasaari, Calf Island. Another known Finnish name of the island was Hirvisaari - Elk (Moose) Island. Topography Geographically, the island consists of two main parts. The south and east of the island are old, with buildings mostly from the 19th century. The southern embankment (with its western part named after St Petersburg University located there) has some of the oldest buildings in the city dated from 18th century. That part of the island is notable for its rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in Amsterdam), with three lengthwise thoroughfares called prospekts – Bolshoi (Big), Sredniy (Middle) and Maly (Small) – going roughly from east to west, and with about 30 crosswise Linii (Lines)Lines in the grid are not streets themselves, but sides of streets . These have peculiar designations. Most of them have numbers instead of verbal names, and one line is a side of a street, not the whole street. Different names/numbers of different sides of the same street are similar to different names of the central city river - the Neva - embankments. The easternmost \\"lined\\" street has sides called, respectively, Kadetskaya (Cadets') liniya on the east and Pervaya (Rus. 1-я - in full, Первая Pervaya (1st - First) liniya on the west. The next parallel street is designated as 2nd and 3rd street and so on, the last being street numbered 28-29th lines. forming about 15 peculiarly numbered streets going perpendicularly from south to north. The island boasts the city's narrowest street named after the artist Ilya Repin. Aerial view of the spit of Vasilyevsky Island Landmarks The easternmost tip of the island, called Strelka (spit, literally Arrow), features a number of museums, including the Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange (Bourse) as well as two Rostral columns, and is a popular tourist attraction. The edifices lining the Universitetskaya Embankment along the Bolshaya Neva include the Kunstkamera, Twelve Collegia, Menshikov Palace, Imperial Academy of Sciences, and St. Andrew's Cathedral – all dating from the 18th century. In the island center there is a considerable Museum of electrical transport organised by transport history enthusiasts. It is based at the oldest Vasileostrovsky tram depot. Another recent notable attraction was an animated floating anchored illuminated musical fountain located just off the Spit.(inaugurated to mark the city's tricentennial, it caused some controversy as it partially obstructed one of city's most famous tourist panoramas - the view of St Peter and Paul's Fortress from the Palace Bridge and has not been put back in place and used so far in the 2nd decade of the 21st century) In contrast with the Neva embankments in the historical center, the western part of the island was developed much later, in the late Soviet times, and has mostly typical Soviet apartment blocks. A monument to Vasily, the legendary Peter I's local gunners' battery commander after whom the island may have been named, was opened in 2003. The principal buildings of Saint Petersburg State University are located on the island and include the Twelve Collegia by Domenico Tresini (1722–44) and the former palace of Peter II of Russia. Economics, science and culture In recent centuries Vasilyevsky Island has provided a home both to academic life and to various industries. =Science and education= The island's learning facilities have included the Imperial Academy of Sciences with its copious library, Saint Petersburg State University (including their Russian Language and Culture Institute), the 1st Army Cadet Corps (later the Military Academy of Supplies and Logistics) and the Naval Cadet Corps, and (among newer bodies) the Civil Service Academy (now termed the North-West Institute of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration). Many of these entities occupy historically significant buildings (for example the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute). The Russian Academy of Sciences with its branches has always had many of its research institutions in its cradle - on the island. They include the institutes of: soils study, zoology, optics, aerial photography, Precambrian and general geology, polymers, world ethnography and anthropology, physiology, chemistry of silicate and fireproof compounds. Possibly best-known of the institutes, the Institute of Russian Literature (known as Pushkin House) holds manuscripts and archives of Russian prominent writers of the past and of the present. A number of institutions maintain museums, some of them open to the general public. Several require neither obligatory pre-booking nor pre-arranging groups-only visits (like Kunstkamera and the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Others require pre- organised visits, like the Literary Museum at Pushkin House or the Soils Study Museum Museum's website in Russian of the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences. =Industries= The island, like many other areas located around the city centre, has had a number of well-developed industries and factories, ranging from shipbuilding to making pianos and to industrial bread baking. Now, in a supposedly post-industrial era, a number of buildings of former factories have been converted to other usages, like the former Jacob Becker's Piano Factory.List of piano brand nameshttp://www.blazonguitars.ru/music_instruments/piano/becker.shtml - Rus. info Energy supply to many industrial facilities and housing in the island is provided by a cogeneration thermal power station. One of three biggest Saint Petersburg shipyards is Baltiysky Zavod (Балтийский завод - Rus. for Baltic Shipyard ). Having had in recent years some financial difficulties, now it is recovering. There are private developers' plans to relocate the factory to Kronshtadt to make way for housing development schemes. Another redevelopment spot is claimed to change part or all of the site of former Steel-rolling Plant (Staleprokatniy zavod - Rus. Сталепрокатный заводhttp://spz.petrostal.ru/ , http://www.petrostal.ru/eng1/hystory/hystory.htm ), presently known as Saint Petersburg Precision Alloys Foundry (Peterburgskiy zavod pretsezionnykh splavov). Until recently, all of Saint Petersburg Metro escalators as well as those for all the underground railroad systems of the former Soviet Union were made since the 1950s at a local facility called Zavod \\"Eskalator\\", now known as LATRES (Rus. abbr. ЛАТРЭСhttp://www.latres.ru Rus. website). Now they produce moving staircases for shopping malls around Russia as well. A major producer of electric power and signal cables is Sevkabel (Rus. for North(ern) Cable (Factory)). Traditionally a branch of metal-processing, this industry now also includes production of optic fibre. Marine and consumer electronics have been designed produced at a number facilities in the island (see e.g. http://www.rimr.ru/eng/), one of them being a nationalized Siemens & Halske plant that was known in the Soviet times as (Nikolay) Kozitsky Plant making Raduga (Rus. for rainbow) colour television sets. Now it is a Raduga group company.http://www.raduga.spb.ru/ Rus. homepage Like every other district of Saint Petersburg in the Soviet times, the island has had its own industrial bakery (Rus. khlebozavod хлебозавод) - Vasileostrovskiy khlebozavod,http://vohleb.narod.ru Rus. homepage now a subsidiary of Fazer Group.http://www.fazer.ru/Bakery/Aboutus/Legal_info/Vasileostrovsky/ =Churches= The Lutheran Church of Saint Michael was built on the island in 1874–1876.

Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, 522 U.S. 520 (1998), was a United States Supreme Court case. The local tribal council in Venetie, Alaska, wanted to collect tax from non-tribal members doing business on tribal lands. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had ruled in the tribe's favor, saying they occupied Indian Country. The Court decided unanimously that the land was not the tribe's land subject to the tribal tax, even though it was owned by the tribe, because it was not part of a Native American reservation. Because all but one reservation in Alaska (the Annette Island reservation of the Tsimshian) had been eliminated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, the decision had the practical effect of prohibiting almost all Indian tribes in Alaska from collecting taxes for activities conducted on tribal land. Taxing authority is reserved as a right of the states and federal government. The State of Alaska, the petitioner, was represented by John G. Roberts, who later became the Chief Justice of the United States. The respondent was represented by Heather Kendall-Miller, an attorney of Athabascan descent.

He was elected as successor to his father, Amadu II of Masina, in 1853. Throughout most of his rule he was involved in conflict with the jihadist al-Hajj 'Umar Tall, who defeated and executed him on 16 May 1862. Background German map of the region c.1861 - Massina to the east. Amadu III was the grandson of the founder of the Diina of Hamdullahi, Seku Amadu. Some time between 1810 and 1818 Seku Amadu (Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Abi Bakr Lobbo) launched a jihad against the Fulbe chiefs in Masina, tributaries of the pagan Bambara of Segu, whom he accused of idolatry. The goals of the jihad soon expanded to that of conquest of the Bambara and others in the region. Aḥmad bin Muḥammad established a large empire based on Hamdallahi, which he had founded as the capital. He received support from Tukolor and Fulbe people who were seeking independence from the Bamabara, although later he met resistance from these people when he imposed a rigorous Islamic theocracy based on the Maliki interpretation of Sharia law. The state was ruled by a council of forty elders, who gave directions to provincial governors. Most of the governors were related to Aḥmad bin Muḥammad. When Aḥmad bin Muḥammad died in 1844, he was succeeded by his son Aḥmad bin Aḥmad (Amadu II), father of Amadu III. Ruler Ahmadu II was killed in 1852 during a raid on the Bambara. He had nominated his son as his successor. In 1853 Amadu III was elected to the position of Almami of the Diina in accordance with his father's wishes. Another candidate for election, Ba Lobbo, was passed over but remained influential as a member of the Tijani faction at court. Ba Lobbo was Amadu's uncle, and a leader in the army. Although less learned than his grandfather and father, Aḥmad III continued their highly puritanical Islamic practices such as banning the use of tobacco and requiring full segregation of men and women. However, he was less rigid in matters of Islamic education and control, more willing to follow traditions of Fulbe social structure. During his rule tensions mounted between the more puritanical Tijaniyyah minority and the more relaxed Qadiriyya community. When the German traveler Heinrich Barth reached Timbuktu in September 1853, he was given the protection of Aḥmad al-Bakkāy, the political and religious leader of the Kunta, who refused Aḥmad III's demands to hand him over. Amadu ordered Barth's death as an infidel. The Hamdullahi forces threatened him several times during his travels in the Middle Niger. The struggle with Segu continued in the early part of his rule, and Amadu III continued to dispatch raids deep into Segu territory until 1855. He tried to gain control of Sinsani so he could use its forces in his conflict with Segu. Conflict with Tukolor al-Hajj Umar Tall The Tukolor religious and military leader al-Hajj 'Umar Tall, originally from Futa Toro, launched a jihad against unbelievers in 1853. He quickly overran many of the Bambara and Malinke states in the upper parts of the Senegal and Niger basins. After defeating the Bambara state of Kaarta in 1855, 'Umar proposed an alliance with Aḥmadu III to conquer the Bambara state of Segu. Aḥmadu may have suspected 'Umar's motives, and instead sent an army to attack 'Umar, which was defeated at Kassakeri in Kaarta by 'Umar's forces in 1856. Recognizing that the Masina troops were Muslim, 'Umar had their wounded treated and returned. This contrasted with his treatment of pagan prisoners. After the defeat, one of Amadu's main advisors, al Hajj Seidou, urged him to make common cause with Bina 'Alī, the Fama (king) of Segu against 'Umar. When al-Hajj 'Umar attacked Segu in 1861, Aḥmadu III lent aid to Bina 'Alī on condition that he accept Islam. In January 1861 the Hamdullahi army was mobilized under the leadership of Ba Lobbo with 8,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry and 1,000 musketeers and was joined at Tio, opposite Sinsani on the right bank of the Niger, by what was left of the Segu forces. In mid-February two fleets of canoes clashed in mid- stream. About 500 of Umar's troops attacked a village near Tio on their own initiative, were caught and destroyed. The next day Umar split his army into two wings, which crossed the river at night, crushed the forces of Masina and Segu at Tio and marched on to the capital of Segu. There they looted the treasures held in the Jara storehouses. In March 1861, Ba Lobbo regrouped his army and advanced towards Segu, but was defeated once more by 'Umar's forces. 'Umar faced criticism in his war against Masina, since its people were Muslims. As proof that 'Alī's conversion was a sham, 'Umar collected idols in Segu that had not been destroyed. 'Umar issued a Bayan in which he said that Ahmadu had accepted \\"a thousand mithqals of gold\\" in return for supporting 'Ali. In a public exchange of letters, 'Umar clearly demonstrated his superior Islamic learning. 'Umar may have been trying to win over the Tijanis under Ba Lobbo. An attempt to arrange peace between Aḥmadu III and 'Umar was not successful, and 'Umar invaded Masina. Defeat and death Territory controlled by al-Hajj 'Umar at the time of his death. In 1862 'Umar advanced into Masina, receiving deserters and meeting little resistance. Amadu III was joined by the Kunta under Ahmad al-Bekkay, who had until then been his enemies but supported him in the face of aggression by a Muslim, which was contrary to the law. Before the decisive battle 'Umar proposed to fight a duel with Aḥmadu III, but the latter refused. Aḥmadu was defeated in battle on 15 May 1862, and 'Umar occupied Hamdallahi. Aḥmadu was captured and decapitated. Ba Lobbo briefly continued resistance against the Tokolor, but the death of Amadu III and the loss of Hamdullahi marked the end of the Massina Empire as an effective force in the region. Despite al-Hajj 'Umar's eloquent justifications, the controversy over the war against the Muslim state of Masina continued after the death of Amadu III. A revolt broke out against 'Umar in 1863, and he was killed in 1864. Although 'Umar did not have time to establish control of Masina, his nephew al-Tijānī (Tidiani Tall) succeeded. It was not until 1897 that the French took control of the region.

The discovery of the nature of the galaxy was accredited to Knut Lundmark and Philibert Jacques Melotte in 1926. It is in the constellation Cetus. Star formation In 1994, A. E. Dolphin used the Hubble Space Telescope to create a color–magnitude diagram for WLM. It showed that around half of all the star formation in this galaxy occurred during a starburst that started ~13 Gyr ago. During the starburst, the metallicity of WLM rose from [Fe/H] ~ −2.2 to [Fe/H] −1.3. There being no horizontal-branch population, Dolphin concludes that no more than per Myr of star formation occurred in the period from 12 to 15 Gyr ago. From 2.5 to 9 Gyr ago, the mean rate of star formation was 100 to per Myr. Being at the edge of the Local Group has also protected WLM from interactions and mergers with other galaxies, giving it a \\"pristine\\" stellar population and state that make it particularly useful for comparative studies.(eso1610)\\"The Wilds of the Local Group\\", 23 March 2016 (Accessed 24/3/2016) http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1610/ Globular cluster WLM Globular Cluster, Hubble Space Telescope WLM has one known globular cluster (WLM-1) at that Hodge et al. (1999) determined having an absolute magnitude of −8.8 and a metallicity of –1.5, with an age of ~15 billion years. This cluster has a luminosity that is slightly over the average for all globulars. The seeming lack of faint low-mass globular clusters cannot be explained by the weak tidal forces of the WLM system. References in popular culture In E. E. Smith’s Lensman novels, the \\"Second Galaxy\\" is identified as \\"Lundmark's Nebula\\". However, some believe the \\"Second Galaxy\\" may not be the Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte galaxy, since the first chapter of the first novel in the series (Triplanetary) and the series-establishing material appearing at the beginning of subsequent novels states that the \\"Second Galaxy\\" and the \\"First Galaxy\\" (the Milky Way) collided and passed through each other \\"edge- on\\" during the \\"planet-forming era\\"—implying that the \\"Lundmark's Nebula\\" of the series must necessarily be obscured from view by the Milky Way; however, according to others, it could have passed through at an angle and thus be identified with the galaxy described in this article; some have stated that this is the galaxy that E.E. Smith was thinking of when he wrote the series. However, the distance to Lundmark's nebula is defined quite precisely in Gray Lensman as approximately 24 million parsecs, much larger than the distance to Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte (approximately 930,000 parsecs). Additionally, in Second Stage Lensmen multiple references are made to the spiral arms of Lundmark's Nebula. Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte does not possess such structures. At the time of writing of these books, the name of Lundmark was associated with such classifications and Smith may have elected to use this as a \\"believable\\" name for an entirely fictional galaxy. At the time the Lensman series was written, most astronomers favored the tidal theory of Solar System formation, which required that planets be formed by the close approach of another star. In order to produce the massive numbers of planets necessary to evolve into galactic civilizations in both the Milky Way and Lundmark's Nebula, as portrayed in the Lensman series, E.E. Smith thought it would have been necessary for another galaxy to have passed through the Milky Way to produce the large number of close encounters necessary to form so many planets. The Doctor Who novel Synthespians™ by Craig Hinton refers to the New Earth Republic of the 101st Century and beyond, which spearheads a programme of colonisation, sending sleeper ships to the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and Andromeda.http://www.whoniverse.net/discontinuity/pd66 ReferencesExternal links * Category:Irregular galaxies Category:Low surface brightness galaxies Category:Local Group Category:Cetus (constellation) 00143 Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1909 Category:UGCA objects ","title":"Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte"},{"id":"2275892","text":"is a military science fiction mecha anime series that has undergone several incarnations. The original 1983 television series was created by Ryosuke Takahashi and Sunrise, featuring mechanical designs by Kunio Okawara. Following directly in the footsteps of Takahashi's previous series, Fang of the Sun Dougram, VOTOMS continued the trend towards hard science in the mecha anime subgenre. The series was supplemented by numerous original video animation releases, and also inspired a number of spin-off works whose media ranges from serialized light novels to video games. The TV anime was originally licensed by the now-defunct Central Park Media who released the series on DVD and VHS. Currently, it is licensed by Maiden Japan, a unit of Section23 Films, who also released all OVA other then Armor Hunter Mellowlink. Plot The Gilgamesh and Balarant nations had until recently been locked in a century-old galactic war whose cause was long ago forgotten. Now, the war is ending and an uneasy truce has settled. The main weapon of the conflict is the common Armored Trooper, a mass-produced humanoid combat vehicle piloted by a single soldier. Both the Armored Troopers and their pilots are also known as VOTOMS (Vertical One-man Tank for Offense & ManeuverS). However, since Armored Troopers have extremely thin armor, and use a highly combustible liquid in their artificial muscle, their pilots have a very low chance of survival, and are commonly referred to instead as \\"Bottoms\\", the lowest of the low (\\"Votoms\\" and \\"Bottoms\\" are written and pronounced the same way in Japanese). The series follows a main character named Chirico Cuvie, a special forces Armored Trooper pilot and former member of the Red Shoulder Battalion, an elite force used by the Gilgamesh Confederation in its war against the Balarant Union. Chirico is suddenly transferred to a unit engaged in a suspicious mission, unaware that he is aiding to steal secrets from what appears to be his own side. Chirico is betrayed and left behind to die, but he survives, is arrested by the Gilgamesh military as a traitor, and tortured for information on their homeworld. He escapes, triggering a pursuit extending across the entire series, with Chirico hunted by the army and criminals alike as he seeks the truth behind the operation. He is especially driven to discover the truth of one of the objects he was assigned to retrieve in that operation: a mysterious and beautiful woman who would become his sole clue to unravelling the galactic conspiracy.

Life and work Isaac Huger was born at Limerick plantation on the Cooper River, the second son of Huguenot merchant and planter Daniel and Mary Cordes Huger. The wealth of his family afforded young Isaac an education in Europe, along with his brothers. Huger began his military career by serving as an officer in Colonel Thomas Middleton's Provincial South Carolina Regiment during the expedition against the Cherokees in 1761. While serving as a representative for the parishes of St. Philip and St. Michael in the First Provincial Congress of South Carolina, Huger was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the South Carolina militia and later commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 1st South Carolina Regiment on June 17, 1775. He was promoted to colonel on September 16, 1776, and appointed commander of the 5th South Carolina Regiment. On January 9, 1779, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Continental Army. It was at his home, near Beaufort, that Lafayette, in 1777, at age 19, landed in America to help against the British. Lafayette would become lifelong friend with Huger and Huger's son, who would repay that friendship by trying to rescue Lafayette from Austrian prison twenty years later. Brigadier General Huger fought and was wounded at the Battle of Stono Ferry on June 20, 1779 and commanded the South Carolina and Georgia militia during the Siege of Savannah on October 9, 1779. During the siege of Charleston in the spring of 1780, he was placed in command of the light horse and militia outside the city. A surprise attack by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton's forces routed and dispersed Huger's troops at Monck's Corner on the morning of April 14, 1780. Illness kept Huger from capture with the surrender of Charleston, and he later rejoined the Southern army under Major General Horatio Gates in North Carolina. He was present when Major General Nathanael Greene took command of the Southern Department in Charlotte later in December. Greene detached his light forces to the western parts of South Carolina and moved his regulars to a camp in the Cheraws, with Huger as his second-in-command. After the brilliant American victory at Cowpens, Huger was entrusted by Greene to lead the command posted in the Cheraws to rejoin the detached light forces in North Carolina. At the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, 1781, he commanded a brigade of Virginia Continental regiments and was slightly wounded in action. Commanding the same brigade at the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill on April 25, Huger initially stood his ground after the unanticipated withdrawal of the right wing of the American line. With the retreat of the British from the interior to Charleston, General Huger was reunited with his family and returned to his home, ending his combative service. Isaac Huger represented St. George Dorchester in the Jacksonborough Assembly in January 1782 and served in the legislature until his election as Sheriff of Charleston District in 1785. Familial ties led to his appointment as the first federal marshal for South Carolina in 1789, a position which he held for five years. Isaac Huger married Elizabeth Chalmers on March 23, 1762 and was the father of eight children. He died in Charleston.

Assembling a force of Fulas and Kountas, he succeeded in driving Umar Tall from Hamdullahi and into the cliffs of Dogon country near Bandiagara in 1864. Although Umar Tall died there in an explosion of his gunpowder reserves, his nephew Tidiani Tall succeeded him as Toucouleur emperor, and suppressed Ba Lobbo's resistance; the Massina never regained their independence as a state.

TerrorVision was made by Empire International Pictures, the production company owned by Charles Band prior to Full Moon, and was released in February 1986. The story follows an alien creature sent to Earth, which ends up inside a household where three kids must take care of it to prevent it from going into a hungry rampage. While not a critical and commercial success, it later developed as a cult film, particularly a \\"so bad it's good\\" film. Plot On an alien planet named Pluton, an alien garbage disposal converts a monstrous mutant called a Hungry Beast into energy and beams it into space. Meanwhile, on Earth, the Putterman family is getting satellite television, courtesy of a temperamental DIY satellite antenna. The reception is poor at first, but suddenly strengthens when a bolt of the alien energy hits the dish. Sherman Putterman and his ex-military, survivalist grandfather set out to enjoy a night of horror films hosted by the buxom Medusa. Meanwhile, Sherman's parents go out to meet some swingers and his sister Suzy goes out with her rocker boyfriend O.D. Sherman and his grandfather eventually fall asleep, but are awakened when the Hungry Beast materializes out of the TV and eats the grandfather. Sherman's parents later arrive along with swingers Cherry and Spiro. Despite Sherman's plea, his mother locks him in the fallout shelter so he will not ruin their evening. Sherman tries calling the police, but they take him to be a prank caller. He also calls Medusa, but she dismisses him as a psychotic. Later, the Beast travels through the television into the house's sex-themed \\"Pleasure Dome\\", eats Cherry, and imitates her to lure Spiro. Sherman's parents also get eaten after they discover the remains of the swingers. Sherman uses some plastic explosive to break out of the bunker as O.D. and his sister arrive. Sherman's sister doesn't believe his story about a monster, and when they check their parents' room, they find imitations of them, their grandfather and the swingers. Soon after though, they encounter the Beast in another room. It chases after them, but relents at the sight of O.D.'s heavy metal paraphernalia, which he finds appealing due to its resemblance of his caretaker's gloves. They then discover that they can subdue the Beast with food and television, and teach it a few words such as \\"TV\\", \\"music\\" and their names. They consider using the Beast for profit, and call Medusa in the hope of securing a TV appearance. She is initially dismissive, but shows interest when they promise to hold a party. However, the Beast becomes enraged and eats O.D. when its alien captor appears on the TV to warn the earthlings that they must destroy their television equipment to prevent the Beast from spreading. A police officer arrives to arrest Sherman for the prank calls only to be eaten by the Beast. Sherman breaks all the TVs he can find, and eventually the Pluton alien captor appears through the television to exterminate the Beast. Medusa arrives at the house and kills the Pluton Alien, mistakenly believing that he is in fact the Beast that Sherman and Suzy have described to her. When the real monster arrives, it sucks the group of three into its mouth with a powerful gust of air. The next morning, Medusa's chauffeur is woken up by a crude imitation of his employer hiding in the back seat of his car, demanding to be taken to the TV station.

In addition to Richard Band's original score, several songs (including the movie's theme) were contributed by Los Angeles art rock band The Fibonaccis.

Factory announced that they would be releasing the film on DVD and Blu-ray as part of their Scream Factory lineup. A DVD/Blu- ray double feature of TerrorVision/The Video Dead was released in February 2013. Reception Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \\"The film's style is so smugly stupid that it's hard to tell whether the creatures, dripping with primordial ooze, are any less attractive than the Puttermans\\" and also called the film \\"noisly [sic] campy without being the least bit clever.\\" Variety dismissed it as \\"an uninvolving sci-fi thriller comedy that relies heavily for its shock value on gooey monster effects rather than cinematic finesse ... With the apparent intent of making some comments about our unnatural reliance on television, and technology in general, filmmakers have perhaps bit off too much.\\"\\"Film Reviews: TerrorVision\\". Variety. February 12, 1986. 22. Writing in the Chicago Tribune, Rick Kogan gave the film 1 star out of 4 and called it \\"a certifiably bad movie\\" with \\"a good deal that is distasteful,\\" but also found it \\"strangely likable\\" because Ted Nicolaou \\"has done a better job than most who have tackled this particular beat. He has a nice feel for pacing if not for tension, a good eye for detail if often excessive and an occasional burst of humor.\\"Kogan, Rick (February 14, 1986). \\"'Terrorvision' has its charms despite being a real horror\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 7J. Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"There are a few wonderful moments scattered throughout the picture, clearly the kind of goofy monster mash that should be seen long after midnight when your brain is operating at half-speed ... But to mix up the gross-outs with gags you need a good curve ball — the jokes should have a real spin to them. That weird comic rhythm is missing here. In fact, Nicolaou has such a terrible sense of timing that the scenes drag on long after every laugh has been squeezed dry.\\"Goldstein, Patrick (April 15, 1986). \\"'Terrorvision: Mutant, Family See Eye to Eye\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 5. Pop Matters called \\"TerrorVision \\"a truly wretched movie.\\" As of July 2019, TerrorVision currently holds a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews.

It runs from Sligo to Lifford, County Donegal. It forms part of the proposed Atlantic Corridor route.Atlantic Corridor Route The N15 commences halfway across Lifford Bridge (which crosses the River Foyle between County Donegal and County Tyrone), continuing the route of the A38 (from Strabane on the east side of the river). In Lifford, west of the River Foyle, the N14 meets the N15, ending at a junction in the town centre. The N15 leaves to the southwest, changing to run west at the point just west of Clady. It continues west through Castlefin, Liscooley and Killygordon to reach Stranorlar. In Stranorlar, the N13 commences, leaving the N15 to head north, with the N15 itself turning southwest to cross the River Finn to enter Ballybofey. From here, it continues southwest through the mountains and Barnesmore Gap (passing southeast of Bluestack Mountain) towards Donegal Town. East of the town itself, the N56 road starts at a junction on the N15 and runs around the north of the town, with the N15 turning to the south, to bypass the eastern side of Donegal Town. The N15 crosses the Drummenny Burn on the eastern outskirts of Donegal Town. South of Donegal Town, the N15 passes by Ballintra to the west. Further south, the route follows a road opened in 2006, bypassing Ballyshannon to the east and crossing the River Erne on a viaduct. The road enters County Leitrim in the west of Ireland, directly west of Bundoran (the bypass passes south of the town). Tullaghan is the only village along the N15 in the county, also bypassed. The N15 runs closer to the coastline in County Sligo, passing through Cliffoney and Grange as it proceeds southwest. The road then passes through the villages of Drumcliff and Rathcormack before entering Sligo. The route ends at the start of the N4, which continues through the town as the Sligo Inner Relief Road dual carriageway. Planned and Completed upgrades A Pothole on the N15 near Castelgal school The route between Lifford and Stranorlar is a single carriageway road of very poor quality. A replacement of the current alignment with a new single carriageway road is planned, bypassing Castlefin, Liscooley, and Killygordon. This will connect with a 2+1 bypass of Stranorlar and Ballybofey which is also planned. This will bypass the towns to the south, with a new crossing of the River Finn. A before and after shot of the Creevykeel crossroads looking towards Donegal A before and after shot of the Ceevykeel crossroads looking towards Sligo The N15 runs for over in County Sligo, passing north of the mountains and around Benbulbin before turning around Drumcliffe Bay to enter Sligo Town. A bypass of the entire route was planned, with dual carriageway for at least part of the route. A route had been selected for the project, with the new road to run closer to the mountains and the bay than the existing N15. However, the NRA didn't give funding for the road and the project was suspendedN15 Realignment TII The local radio station in the North-West, Ocean FM had a special report in 2017 on how the road in Sligo needs to be upgraded in the wake of 3 crashes on this stretch of road in less than a fortnight.three crashes in two weeks- Ocean FM.

The candy is popular in Europe and North America.  History  The sweet brand is named after the town of Werther in Westphalia, where the company was founded in 1903. From 1969, the sweet was marketed under the brand name Werthers Echte. The brand name Werther's Original was adopted in the 1990s for the international market.Storck's history They are now manufactured nearby, in Halle (Westfalen).  Product  The original Werther's Echte was a caramel hard candy. Later variants included chewy toffees, and a soft, waxy form which melts easily inside the mouth called \\"butterscotch-melts.\\" A variant with chocolate filling is also available, as well as three sugarless variants that use isomalt as a sugar substitute: the original butterscotch flavour, a butterscotch coffee swirl, and a butterscotch mint swirl. A product available in the United Kingdom is \\"Werther's Chocolate,\\" a dark and milk chocolate with butterscotch running through it, sold in the same packaging and wrappers as Werther's Originals. A variant available in Canada and the United States, \\"Butterscotch Apple Filled,\\" has a green-apple-flavored filling.  Commercials  Well-known TV advertisements in Germany and the United Kingdom from around 1991 featured an older man offering Werther's butterscotch to his grandson.

One of these ads was dubbed into Japanese and aired in Japan in the early 2000's. Its off-putting voice acting led to it becoming an Internet meme in Japan on sites such as 2channel and Nico Nico Douga. One British advertisement consisted of a montage of the grandfather and grandson bonding together (for example, pointing at animals out of train windows).

Eidetic reduction requires that a phenomenologist examine the essence of a mental object, be it a simple mental act, or the unity of consciousness itself, with the intention of drawing out the absolutely necessary and invariable components that make the mental object what it is. This reduction is done with the intention of removing what is perceived, and leaving only what is required.Gert H. Mueller. Analytical Sociology: An Outline Overview One can take for example Descartes's piece of wax (not as a mental object, but as a demonstration of the concept of reduction). It appears to be opaque, flat, hard, extended to certain dimensions in space. It has a certain feel, smell, taste. Most of these qualities can be negated as necessary to the piece of wax continuing to be a piece of wax; the smell, taste, texture, opacity. If heated, it will continue to be the same piece of wax, the same molecules. However, the taste may change, the smell may become more noticeable, the texture will obviously change, it will become clear if heated to the point of melting, etc. The only things that remain (its extension into space, chemical makeup, and mass) are the things that are required for the existence of that piece of wax. Eidetic reduction is a form of imaginative variation by which one attempts to reduce a phenomenon into its necessary essences. This is done by theoretically changing different elements (while mentally observing whether or not the phenomenon changes) of a practical object to learn which characteristics are necessary for it to be it without being something else. If a characteristic is changed, and the object remains unchanged, the characteristic is unnecessary to the essence of the object, and vice versa. The basic steps of an eidetic reduction are threefold: first, choose some specific example (e.g., Descartes' wax). Then, vary the example imaginatively. The third step involves figuring out that which cannot be eliminated while the example remains itself. That which cannot be eliminated is part of the example's essence. As an instructive process, eidetic reduction might be viewed as processes of abstraction; the works of Whitehead and Russell in their Principia Mathematica could give one a taste of those processes, or even the simple contemplation of mathematics itself in use: \\"How many ideas have you?\\" and the respondent may claim, \\"Just two.\\" See also * Epistemology * Phenomenological reduction References Category:Phenomenology Category:Edmund Husserl ","title":"Eidetic reduction"},{"id":"2276012","text":"Eastern Orthodox cross July 29 - Eastern Orthodox Church calendar - July 31 All fixed commemorations below are celebrated on _August 12_ by Old Calendar.

The five perpetrators, members of the Joe Boys, a Chinese youth gang, were attempting to kill leaders of the Wah Ching, a rival Chinatown gang. The attack left five people dead and 11 others injured, none of whom were gang members. Seven perpetrators were later convicted and sentenced in connection with the murders. The massacre led to the establishment of the San Francisco Police Department's Asian Gang Task Force, credited with ending gang-related violence in Chinatown by 1983. The restaurant itself closed in 2006.  Shooting  Central Ping Yuen (2018), at the corner of Stockton and Pacific = Motivation = The incident was motivated by a longstanding feud between two rival Chinatown gangs, the Joe Boys (Chung Ching Yee) and Wah Ching, traced back to 1969, when the first victim was killed. The two gangs controlled different parts of San Francisco, with the Wah Ching in Chinatown and the Joe Boys in the Richmond and Sunset districts, and had been rivals since the Joe Boys splintered off from the Wah Ching in the late 1960s. The shooting at the Golden Dragon was an attempted assassination of Wah Ching leaders, and was a direct retaliation for the shootout with the Wah Ching in Chinatown's Ping Yuen (Peace Garden) housing project (Chinese: 平園住宅房屋大廈) on July 4, 1977 which was sparked by a dispute over fireworks sales. That shootout resulted in the death of 16-year-old Felix Huey (Chinese: 許非力; sometimes romanized as Huie) and the wounding of Melvin Yu, both members of the Joe Boys. Huey's murder, in turn, was seen as a reprisal for the earlier death of Kin Chuen Louie, a 20-year-old member of the Wah Ching who had been shot a dozen times on May 31 while attempting to escape in his car. Louie's death was later memorialized in a poem by Michael McClure, who came upon the victim shortly after the shooting. Including those victims in the Golden Dragon, 44 people had been murdered in gang violence in San Francisco Chinatown by 1977; Inspector John McKenna of the San Francisco Police counted 55 dead between 1969 and 1977. =Planning= The raid was planned in a Daly City apartment. Preparations began in early 1977, when Joe Boys members began acquiring the weapons that would be used in the massacre; during the summer of 1977, Tom Yu, a leader of the Joe Boys, convinced a longtime friend who owned a home in Pacifica to store the weapons, wrapped in cloth, in the front closet of that home. On August 29, 1977, Yu met with Carlos Jon, a member of another gang; Yu asked Jon to keep track of Wah Ching and allied Hop Sing Tong gang members over the upcoming Labor Day weekend, showing special interest in where they gathered late at night. The conspirators decided to target the Golden Dragon because it was a favorite hangout of both the Wah Ching and Hop Sing Tong. The planned raid would also financially damage Jack Lee, a Hop Sing elder who co-owned the restaurant. Yu gave Jon the phone number of the Pacifica home and asked him to call on the following Saturday (September 3). That Friday night (September 2), members of the Joe Boys gathered in Pacifica, retrieved the weapons and put them on display. Yu received a phone call at 1:00 a.m. on Saturday morning, and after a brief, private conversation, ordered the weapons to be put back into the closet. By this time, the group plotting the shooting consisted of Tom Yu, his brothers (Chester and Dana), Melvin Yu (no relation), Peter Ng, Peter Cheung, Curtis Tam, Kam Lee, and Don Wong. Golden Dragon Restaurant on the north side of Washington (facing west from Grant), circa October 2000. Photographed by Carol Highsmith Later that evening, the gang returned to Pacifica. Around 9:30 p.m., two members of the Joe Boys, Peter Cheung and Dana Yu were asked to steal a four-door car, which would facilitate entry and exit for a quick getaway; they returned shortly afterward with a blue Dodge Dart and parked it in the home's driveway. The gang members retrieved the guns from the closet after the homeowners returned and went to sleep. At 2:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time on Sunday, September 4, 1977, Tom Yu received a phone call from Carlos Jon that members of the rival Wah Ching gang, including Michael \\"Hot Dog\\" Louie, one of its leaders, were present at the Golden Dragon restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown (Chinese: 三藩市華埠金龍大酒樓). Chester Yu drove a group of four Joe Boys (himself, Curtis Tam, Melvin Yu, and Peter Ng) to the Golden Dragon using the stolen Dodge. Forty minutes later, at 2:40 a.m., Chester Yu parked the stolen car near the Golden Dragon and stayed in the driver's seat while the others went to the restaurant. Armed with a .45-caliber Commando Mark III rifle (a modern clone of the Thompson submachine gun), two 12 gauge pump-action shotguns, and a .38-caliber revolver, the other three donned nylon stocking masks and entered the restaurant from the second entrance at 818 Washington, looking for members of the Wah Ching. During the trial of Curtis Tam, Chester Yu testified that Tam was wielding a shortened shotgun, Ng had a long-barreled shotgun and a handgun, and Melvin Yu was using the rifle. A crowd estimated between 50 to more than 100 people, many of whom were tourists, were present at the restaurant at the time of the shooting. =At the Golden Dragon= According to Chester Yu, Ng had instructed Tam to fire a shot in the ceiling first so that \\"when the people panic and get down on the floor, we will decide who to shoot.\\" Instead, without warning, the three randomly opened fire on the patrons inside the crowded restaurant, killing five people, including two tourists, and wounding 11 others, none of whom were gang members. In Tam's confession, he stated he had been forced to join the shooting and deliberately did not target any patrons; after he \\"heard Melvin start shooting, then Peter. I fired my first shot at the sofa. The second I aimed where nobody was.\\" Testimony at Melvin Yu's trial showed he was the first to open fire, using the rifle. Melvin Yu walked directly up to a man at a table and shot him nine times, continuing to shoot after that victim had fallen to the floor. Melvin Yu then redirected his automatic rifle and shot randomly into the crowd, accompanied by two shotgun blasts from the other gunmen. The first victim, later identified as Paul Wada, a visiting law student, may have been misidentified as a gang sympathizer. An initial news report incorrectly identified some shooting victims as \\"highly placed\\" gang members. The intended targets, the leadership of the Wah Ching and Hop Sing, were sitting at a table at the back of the restaurant. They were not injured in the shooting. Up to 10 members of the Wah Ching, including their leader, Michael Louie, ducked under tables during the gunfire. They had been alerted by a friend who spotted the three gunmen running toward the restaurant from a front-facing window and shouted \\"Man with a gun!\\" in Cantonese and English. Triad member Raymond Kwok Chow, then 17 years old and a member of the allied Hop Sing Tong, who would later achieve considerable notoriety, was among those who survived the attack. The shooting lasted less than 60 seconds. Police later called it the worst mass murder in San Francisco history. Comedians Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman of the Firesign Theatre were eating at the Golden Dragon during the shooting, after performing a Proctor and Bergman show at the Great American Music Hall. When Bergman, an Army veteran, realized the perpetrators had emptied their weapons, he rose from cover in time to see their faces as they exited. He later testified in their conviction. Two off- duty armed police officers were also dining at the Golden Dragon during the attack. James Bonanno, a restaurant patrolman, dove for cover when the gunmen entered; he later testified that he pulled his revolver and radioed for help while hiding. Once the shooting stopped, after 30 to 45 seconds, he emerged and began to help the wounded diners. Richard Hargens (or Harkins) also fell to the floor after hearing shots and though he drew his revolver, he stated other people were in his line of fire and he was unable to shoot the gunmen. Neither officer was able to identify the gunmen beyond describing them as \\"young Orientals\\". =Cleaning up= 433 Airport Blvd, site of Kee Joon's in Burlingame Chester Yu drove the shooters back to the house in Pacifica after the shooting, and the weapons were returned to the closet. After their return, the Joe Boys stayed awake until dawn discussing the shooting, then slept for a few hours before awakening to listen to the news of the killing. They dispatched Tony Chun-Ho Szeto, another Joe Boy, to pick up noodles from the Golden Dragon for breakfast. Later that morning, the perpetrators retrieved the weapons from the closet, cut them into pieces in the garage, and asked Szeto to dump the pieces into San Francisco Bay. Szeto drove Chester Yu to a location within sight of Kee Joon's, a Burlingame restaurant where Szeto worked, and together they dumped the parts into the Bay near San Francisco International Airport. A week after the shooting, Tom Yu called Carlos Jon for the last time, asking Jon to \\"keep cool.\\"  Victims  The five victims fatally shot at the restaurant were later identified as: * Calvin M. Fong (方凱文), 18, a graduate of Archbishop Riordan High School * Donald Kwan (君唐勞), 20, a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School * Denise Louie (雷典禮), 21, an urban planning student at the University of Washington * Paul Wada (和田保羅), 25, a law student at the University of San Francisco * Fong Wong (黃芳), 48, an immigrant from Hong Kong working as a server at the Golden Dragon Aftermath One week after the shooting, two Joe Boys were shot by suspected Wah Ching gunmen, leaving one dead and the other critically wounded, in what police called a revenge-motivated shooting. Michael Lee, 18, was killed and Lo \\"Mark\\" Chan, 19, was wounded critically during the ambush at the entryway of Chan's Richmond District home. Chinatown, one of the leading tourist destinations in San Francisco, suffered after the shooting. Nighttime dining in Chinatown was depressed as restaurant reservations were cancelled en masse following the shooting. Although the Golden Dragon reopened just seven hours after the shooting, it closed as early as 10 P.M. in the week following a drop in patronage; normally it would stay open until 3 A.M. Business and tourist traffic remained depressed for several weeks following the shootings, although other businesses stated the rising cost of labor in Chinatown was to blame for increased prices and decreased patronage. By December, business at the Golden Dragon remained down and police had still not made any arrests, although by that time Michael Louie, the reported target that night, had been arrested for his suspected involvement with the 1976 murder of Kit Mun Louie (no relation), an 18-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong. =Investigation= The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) announced they were close to solving the crime soon after the shooting, but Chief Charles Gain criticized the Chinatown community for its silence and \\"abdication of responsibility\\" due to \\"the subculture of fear\\" of gang reprisals. SFPD Lieutenant Daniel Murphy, head of the investigation, said \\"because so many innocent people were killed and injured, this time we have been getting more cooperation out of the residents and witnesses in Chinatown than we normally do.\\" Chinatown residents came forward to provide tips in the days following the shooting, identifying that Wah Ching diners and Joe Boys assailants were present that night. Chief Gain followed up his earlier criticism by calling gambling in Chinatown \\"blatant, historic and rampant\\". Gain later claimed his criticism of gambling in Chinatown was a gambit to anger the community and provoke them into providing more information. Gordon Lew, an editor of the local Chinatown newspaper East-West, in turn criticized the SFPD for relying on information and cooperation from community leaders linked to the underworld, leading to community distrust of the SFPD, and concluded that \\"committing suicide is not a virtue among the Chinese\\". Joe Fong, founder of the Joe Boys, said in an interview from prison that SFPD officers had been paid to protect gambling operations in Chinatown, which Chief Gain disputed, saying that was part of the police culture prior to his ascension to chief. Mayor George Moscone announced a reward for information leading to the conviction of the shooters two days after it occurred, the largest reward offered in San Francisco to date. The unprecedented reward was eventually increased to in late September, the highest reward allowed by city law. The SFPD received the first lead in the case two weeks after the shooting, pointing at Curtis Tam. However, by December 1977, no arrests had been made, though police were investigating the deadly rivalry between the Joe Boys and Wah Ching. The reward was eventually collected by Gan Wah \\"Robert\\" Woo of the Joe Boys. Woo had been arrested in March 1978 for participating in another gang skirmish on February 15 in Portsmouth Square, a shooting that left two Wah Ching members wounded. He gave the police a recording of Tam conversing about the massacre; subsequently, Woo was kept in protective custody after he had been identified as the informant. =Arrests= Curtis Tam, Melvin Yu, Peter Ng, Chester Yu, and Tom Yu were eventually arrested and convicted; after their arrests, the gunmen were identified as Ng, Melvin Yu, and Tam, all 17 years old at the time of the shooting. Curtis Tam was the first to be arrested on March 24, 1978. Tam, an emigrant from Hong Kong, was 18 years old and attending Galileo High School at the time of his arrest. A police informant recorded Tam recounting details of the attack, and shortly after his arrest, anonymous sources identified Tam as one of the gunmen, During his initial interrogation, Tam confessed and implicated 11 others. A hearing was held in April 1978 to determine if Tam should be tried as an adult, which was granted. The recording of Tam's interrogation was first played at an arraignment hearing in May 1978 and again at his trial; in it, he claimed \\"They made me do it. If I didn't shoot somebody then they'd say, you know, I'm chicken. I don't think I shot anybody 'cause I didn't aim at anybody.\\" In early April 1978, the Yu brothers (Tom, Chester, and Dana) hired an attorney, George Walker, to make a plea bargain; in turn, their attorney met with the assigned assistant district attorney, Hugh Levine, on April 3 and explained his three unnamed clients were requesting immunity for two brothers (Tom and Dana Yu) in exchange for their testimony against the shooters. Walker described those two brothers as peripherally involved, specifically calling Tom Yu \\"a peripheral figure who had inadvertently answered a telephone call at the house in Pacifica\\" which had informed him that members of the Wah Ching and Hop Sing were at the Golden Dragon. The third brother, Chester, admitted to his role as the getaway driver, but requested for his proceedings to be held in juvenile court in exchange for his testimony. Levine tentatively agreed to allow the driver to enter juvenile court and provided immunity to the two brothers, conditioned upon confirmation that (1) they were only peripherally involved in the crime and (2) their testimony was truthful. Levine met Walker's three clients for the first time on April 19; Dana Yu's request for immunity was granted, and Chester Yu was allowed to enter the juvenile court system. However, since Levine already knew that Tom Yu, as a leader in the Joe Boys, could not have been involved only peripherally, immunity for Tom Yu was rejected. The weapons used in the attack were recovered by police divers from San Francisco Bay on April 20, 1978 after Chester Yu showed them where they had been dumped. After Chester mentioned that a \\"Carlos\\" had called the house in Pacifica, Carlos Jon became a witness for the prosecution. At a preliminary hearing in May 1978, Tony Szeto described \\"bungled efforts to dump a bagful of guns\\". Ballistics tests matched the recovered weapons with bullets taken from those killed. On April 21, the SFPD announced the arrests of Peter Ng and an unnamed juvenile (later identified as the driver of the getaway car, Chester Yu), and named Melvin Yu as another suspect they were seeking in connection with the massacre. Melvin Yu and Peter Cheung were arrested early on the morning of April 23, east of Carson City, Nevada. Tom Yu dropped George Walker as his attorney and surrendered to police after the Memorial Day weekend. In all, nine were arrested and scheduled to be tried for their roles in the massacre: Curtis Tam, Peter Ng, Tom Yu, Melvin Yu, Kam Lee, Chester Yu, Tony Szeto, Peter Cheung, and Donald Wong. =Trials= By August 1978, three youths who were charged with being accessories to the crimes had been found guilty or pleaded guilty in closed juvenile court proceedings. Curtis Tam Tam was scheduled to go on trial on July 31, 1978, but the trial was delayed while a change of venue was being contemplated. Tam's trial began on August 21, and he was convicted on five murder counts and eleven assault counts on September 5, 1978. Attorneys for the defendant made several motions to move the trial venue, sequester the jury, and ban reporters from the courtroom, none of which were granted. During his trial, Tam testified he had deliberately aimed his shotgun away from diners and only participated in the shooting under duress. However, Chester Yu testified that Tam was \\"very happy\\" after the shooting and recalled hearing Tam say he \\"wanted to shoot more people\\", and Tam was recorded by Robert Woo, threatening the life of a suspected police informant. Thirteen eyewitnesses were called to testify at Tam's trial, including eight of the eleven wounded; none identified Curtis Tam as one of the gunmen, although the witness who initially spotted the trio running toward the restaurant identified Peter Ng from a police photograph. The prosecutors rested their case against Tam on August 29 after playing a recording of his confession, taken after his arrest on March 24. Attorneys made closing arguments on September 1, and after the Labor Day weekend, the jury reconvened on September 5; after deliberating for just over a day, the jury found Tam guilty of five counts of second degree murder, eleven counts of assault, and several weapons possession charges. Tam faced a sentence of up to 35 years imprisonment, but a defense attorney vowed to appeal the verdict, which he called \\"a compromise\\" because he thought \\"[the jury] considered duress in reducing their finding of intent on Tam's part\\". The sentencing hearing was set for October 3. Tam received a sentence of 28 years imprisonment. On June 18, 1981, the California Court of Appeals reduced his sentence to 23 years. Tam filed another appeal in August 1981. Melvin Yu After Tam's trial, Tom Yu, Melvin Yu, and Peter Ng stood trial. On September 26, 1978, Melvin Yu was convicted after four hours of deliberation of five counts of first-degree murder and 11 counts of assault with a deadly weapon; his attorney offered no defense against the charges, and Melvin Yu did not testify at his trial. He received a life sentence. Melvin Yu was released from Solano State prison in 2015. Peter Ng Peter Ng went on trial on January 8, 1979 in Fresno, and was convicted on February 22 of five counts of first degree murder and eleven counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Jurors deliberated four hours before reaching the verdict. Tom Yu Tom Yu was indicted but moved to dismiss the charges on the basis that he had been granted immunity by Levine; the trial court denied the motion, finding both that he had not satisfied the two imposed conditions, and further, that his proposed testimony was not true. Yu then entered a conditional guilty plea in 1979 on one count of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder and admitted that a firearm was used in the crime. The plea bargain had been extended to Tom Yu on April 25, 1978, modified on May 30, and accepted by Yu on September 1. However, upon reviewing the probation report, which called Tom Yu \\"the prime mover in the whole thing\\", the court rejected the plea bargain and restored the original charges. Yu appealed the rejection of the plea bargain, since the court had previously ruled it was a binding agreement, although the presiding judge also added the condition that court judgment could be used to set it aside. The trial venue had been moved first to Fresno due to publicity in San Francisco, and then to Santa Barbara since Peter Ng had already been tried and convicted in Fresno. Yu's first trial ended in a hung jury in September 1979. He was later convicted of five counts of first degree murder, eleven counts of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, one count of conspiracy to commit murder, and one count of conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in state prison. =Release and parole= In October 1991, Curtis Tam was released from prison. Tam requested a Certificate of Rehabilitation and Pardon in September 2018; the request was denied in November. In 2014, Melvin Yu was granted parole; during the parole hearing, he said that he had plans to live with a cousin in Hong Kong and expected to be deported back to there. As of 2017, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate of San Francisco stated that there was no record for deportation requests for Yu, and Yu had been living in San Francisco. Yu converted to Christianity approximately ten years after the shooting at the Golden Dragon, and served time at Deuel Vocational Institute, where he took college courses in mathematics. Tom Yu was eligible for parole in 2017 and was released before September 2018. Peter Ng was eligible for parole in 2020, after being denied eight times, most recently in 2015. According to state records, he was no longer listed as an inmate in 2018. = Long-term results = 2007 photograph after name changed to \\"Imperial Palace\\" An ex-Joe Boys member, Bill Lee, wrote about the killings and his gang experiences in Chinese Playground: A Memoir. Lee left the gang shortly after the 1977 massacre. He filed a police report over an April 1999 incident, in which former peers said he should not have written the book during a public reading. The Golden Dragon Massacre led to the establishment of the SFPD's Chinatown (later Asian) Gang Task Force, credited with ending gang-related violence in Chinatown by 1983. The Task Force's first credited arrest was for Michael Louie, the reputed 21-year-old leader of the Wah Ching who was one of the targets in the Golden Dragon Massacre. Michael Louie was arrested on December 5, 1977 for the murder of Kit Mun Louie (no relation). Kit Mun was an 18-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong (via Honolulu) who was shot and killed on August 29, 1976. The two had been romantically involved, but he confessed to being angry with her for \\"whoring around with Joe Boys\\". He claimed that to frighten her, he put an unloaded gun to her head as she was sleeping and pulled the trigger. Although he had removed the clip to unload it, the firing chamber was still loaded with a live round and he shot her at point-blank range. Afterward, he scattered pieces of the weapon in San Francisco Bay and dumped her body near Stinson Beach, where it was discovered on January 1, 1977, but not identified until November 1977. Michael Louie pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and possession of a deadly weapon after his arrest, receiving a sentence of 15 years imprisonment in January 1978; he was eligible for parole after four years. Robert Woo, the informant who collected the $100,000 reward, was killed during a shootout with police while robbing a jewelry shop in Los Angeles on December 19, 1984. The Golden Dragon restaurant continued operation shortly after the massacre, but patronage was down and it failed a health inspection in September 1978.

Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 30 (US 30) in East Liverpool at the West Virginia state line on the Jennings Randolph Bridge over the Ohio River; its northern terminus is at SR 531 in Ashtabula. The route is concurrent with US 30 through East Liverpool and with Interstate 80 (I-80) near Youngstown. The first section of the route to be completed, from Canfield to Austintown, opened in 1969. The entire current route was complete in 1972, and upgraded to a divided highway by 1980. Route description All of SR 11 is included as a part of the National Highway System, a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highest traffic count is at I-80 near Austintown, where 38,360 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. The lowest traffic count is near US 6, where 5,550 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. SR 11 starts at Jennings Randolph Bridge, and becomes concurrent with US 30 and SR 39 as it turns southwest. The concurrency bends around East Liverpool, SR 39 leaves the concurrency, and SR 7 joins it. The route finally turns north and leaves East Liverpool. It turns northwest, near the southern terminus of SR 170. It intersects the concurrency termini of SR 7 and US 30 in these three miles. SR 11 travels through forests, passes by Lisbon, only connecting with SR 154 at an interchange. The highway travels north to near Leetonia, where it meets SR 344 at a diamond interchange. The forests slowly change into farmland, as it passes under SR 14 and into Mahoning County. In Mahoning County, the route becomes part of the eastern city limits of Canfield, meeting US 224 at a parclo interchange. The highway crosses over the Ohio Turnpike, and becomes concurrent with I-80 few miles later. Here, most of the route is surrounded by urban areas. The interchange with I-80 and I-680 is incomplete, with ramps from I-680 west to I-80 east and I-80 west to I-680 east missing. I-80 and SR 11 travel northeast, leaves Mahoning County, and enters Trumbull County. SR 11 and I-80 split at the interchange at SR 711, east of Girard. This interchange is also incomplete, with ramps from I-80 east to SR 711 south and SR 711 to I-80 west missing. SR 11 continues north toward Ashtabula, meeting interchanges for SR 82 and an access road to the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. Urban areas transition back into rural areas here. It later intersects SR 305 and SR 5 at diamond interchanges near Cortland. The route then enters Ashtabula County, and travels in a straight line, passing through US 322, a rest area, US 6, and SR 307. Mostly forests and fields are between the highway. The route slowly bends northwest, and meets I-90 at a cloverleaf interchange. The route crosses over Ashtabula River, and bypasses Ashtabula. It ends at SR 531, part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour, at a stop sign. History SR 11 near SR 5 SR 11 was designated between 1967–1969 as a connector between Canfield and Austintown. Two years later, it was extended north to I-80, and south to SR 7, north of East Liverpool. A section from SR 531 to SR 307 was also completed. Those two sections were later connected. By 1972, all parts of the route were complete. SR 11 was upgraded to a limited access highway, from SR 82 to SR 307, between 1972 and 1981. In 2000, construction began for the King Graves Road interchange, which opened a year later. On October 24, 2005, the interchange at SR 711 and I-80/SR 11 opened, after it was modified to connect SR 711. The only rest area on SR 11 received turn lanes in 2011. SR 11 was designated as the \\"Lake to River highway\\" on September 28, 1973. The section in Ashtabula County was also designated as the \\"Marine Private Henry Kalinowski Memorial Highway\\" on April 7, 2009. Around 2002, the section in East Liverpool, starting from Newell Street, and ending at the state line, was designated as the \\"Lou Holtz Highway\\". =Chemical spills= There have been three chemical spills on SR 11\\\\. The first one happened on November 30, 1984. A tanker truck leaked Titanium tetrachloride at the I-80/SR 11 interchange at Girard. About 200 residents who lived near the highway were evacuated. No injuries were reported, and the chemicals were soon contained. A spill was reported on July 7, 1996. A tanker truck spilled methyl alcohol onto SR 11 northbound, in Fairfield Township. The spill was contained, and charges were filed against the driver. The third and most recent one, happened on September 9, 2003. A tanker spilled of a flammable solvent between SR 344 and SR 154\\\\. There were no evacuations. Exit list Note that Columbiana county does not have exit numbers on destination signage.

The island is located along Texas's southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is noted for its white sandy beaches. Meaning father in Spanish, it was named after Father José Nicolás Ballí (c.1770-1829), who owned the island and served as a missionary priest and collector of finances for all the churches in the Rio Grande Valley. He also founded the first mission in present-day Cameron County. Padre Island is the second-largest island by area in the contiguous United States, after Long Island in New York on the Atlantic Coast. It is about long* and wide, stretching from the city of Corpus Christi, in the north, to the resort community of South Padre Island in the south. The island is oriented north- south, bordered by the Gulf of Mexico on the east and Laguna Madre on the west. The island's northern end connects to Mustang Island by roadway. The southern end of the island is separated from Brazos Island by the Brazos Santiago Pass. The town of South Padre Island is located on its southern end, with the city of Corpus Christi situated at the northern end, but the island as a whole is sparsely populated. The central part of the island is preserved in a natural wild state as Padre Island National Seashore and part of the lower island is protected as part of the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge. Since 1964, the island has been divided by the artificial Port Mansfield Channel. The terms \\"North Padre Island\\" and \\"South Padre Island\\" are often used to refer to the separated portions of the island. Padre Island is included within the jurisdictions of Cameron, Kenedy, Kleberg, Nueces, and Willacy counties in Texas.  History  The island was used and occupied seasonally by the Karankawa people at the time of European encounter. During Spanish rule, Father José Nicolás Ballí, also known as Padre Ballí, owned the island in the 19th century, when it was known as the Isla de Santiago land grant. Padre Island had been granted in 1759 to his Spanish colonist grandfather, Nicolás Ballí, by King Charles III of Spain. The younger Ballí's parents were both Spanish immigrants to Mexico and owned vast amounts of land by royal grants. José Nicolás Ballí served as a secular priest and missionary; he also managed large amounts of land where he ran a ranching operation. In 1804 he founded the first ethnic Mexican settlement on the island as the town of \\"El Rancho Santa Cruz de Buena Vista\\" (later known as Lost City). In 1827 after Mexico achieved independence, Father Ballí requested a clear title to the property of Padre Island. His mother Rosa María Hinojosa de Ballí had made a joint application with him for eleven leagues of the island, but when reapplication was required in 1800, she withdrew her name in favor of him. After Ballí died in 1829, the government granted title to the island to him posthumously, issued jointly in his name and that of his nephew Juan José Ballí. He had bequeathed half the island to his nephew, who had worked with him on his ranch. During World War II, United States scientists considered Padre Island as one of eight candidate sites for the first test of an atomic bomb but chose White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for the detonation, instead.  Geology  Padre Island sand dunes at sunset Geologically speaking, Padre Island is a young island, having formed in just the last several thousand years. It is one of 300 barrier islands stretching from Maine to Mexico. These natural barrier islands act to protect the mainland from the direct onslaught of storms. Padre Island began forming as a submerged sand bar some 4500 years ago, as shown by radiocarbon dating of shells. Geologic speculation indicates the emerged island may be 1000 to 1500 years younger. Barrier island origins have been debated for many years by geologists, but it is agreed they are formed and modified by such factors as sediment type and supply, sea-level directional changes, current and wave strength and direction, and tide magnitude. It is theorized that Padre Island formed from offshore shoals, with later growth aided by spit accretion. (A spit is a long, narrow tongue of sand extending from a mainland shoreline and formed by the shoreline drifting of sediments.) After a history of shifting, abandonment and reestablishment by storm breaches, many tidal inlets were slowly closed. Short islands were joined to form today's longer islands. Padre Island graphically illustrates the life and sequences of a barrier shoreline: accretionary or building phase, equilibrium or stability phase, and erosion or destructional state. The northern half of Padre Island's shoreline is in equilibrium; the southern half (and much of the remaining Texas coastline) is in an erosional stage. Wind, wave and current action continue to rework and shape the island. South Padre Island has been in a destructive phase for a long time, probably having retreated landward (along with the lagoon and mainland shoreline). All of Padre Island will probably retreat landward through long-term erosion due to three causes: interruption and decrease in sediment supply, relative sea level rise, and tropical storm activity. Today, hurricane washovers and wind- carried sand deposited in Laguna Madre build Padre Island's landward side at the expense of Laguna Madre. Wildlife= Birds = Flocks of migratory birds arrive at the island during either early spring or fall and winter, with thousands of birds spending the winter there or migrating through the area. During the summer the most common birds are shore and marshbirds as well as some raptors and songbirds. Kemp's ridley sea turtle The most common birds on the Gulf beach during the year are the willet, sanderling, black skimmer, great blue heron, double-crested cormorant, cattle egret, grey plover, laughing gull, brown pelican, reddish egret, and five species of terns, including the least tern, Caspian tern, black tern, Sandwich tern, and royal tern. The two periodically appearing birds nesting on the park's shores are the least tern and piping plover. = Kemp's ridley sea turtle = In September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas wildlife officials found a record 128 Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, including 81 in the Padre Island National Seashore and 4 on nearby Mustang Island. Wildlife officials had released 10,594 Kemp's ridleys hatchlings along the Texas coast in 2007. The turtles are endangered due to getting caught in shrimpers' nets; they are widely hunted in Mexico as popular sources of boot material and food.

Appearances= Games = For generations, Xianghua's ancestors of the Chai family have groomed men and women into seasoned warriors of China. A woman named Xiangfei was sent to the prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay with the jian. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk who was to inherit of the holy bo staff, the Kali-Yuga. After their illegitimate oldest daughter, Xianglian, was taken from her parents on her second birthday, Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, their sworn brother, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again. Xiangfei, pregnant with another girl, secretly left the temple to become a member of the Ming Dynasty secret Imperial Guard, the Jinyiwei. Months later, she gave birth to her youngest daughter, Xianghua, but never revealed anything about the girl's father or his lineage to her. By this time, the temple had found that Xiuqiang had stolen the Krita-Yuga and he was exiled, but Xianglian was to remain there to be trained as an orphan. Xiuqiang eventually discovered Xiangfei's whereabouts, but the Chai family asked him to leave her alone. As time passed, Xianghua had learned to use the Krita-Yuga just as well as her mother, and Xiangfei died after her 11th birthday. Five years afterward, Xianghua herself became a member of the Imperial Guard. Prior to the events of Soulcalibur, the Emperor became displeased with the search for the legendary \\"Hero's Sword\\" (really Soul Edge), so he sent members of his Guard to help the quest advance. The guards would travel undercover under the guise of a traveling opera troupe, with Xianghua to be the main attraction. As Xianghua prepares for her journey, she recalls her mother's dying words that she was born to complete an important task and cut a path through an uncertain future. With her mother's keepsake jian, Xianghua left on her own after cutting her hair short. On her journey, she encounters a Ling-Sheng Su member Kilik and a Ryūkyū pirate Maxi. Told of the sword's true evil nature by Kilik, she agrees to aid both of them in their quest to destroy it, not knowing that her long-lost older sister Xianglian had been accidentally killed by Kilik when he was consumed by a berserker-style rage. Together, they storm the evil- infested Ostrheinsburg Castle in Europe as Maxi stays behind and defeats Astaroth, disappearing soon after, while Kilik and Xianghua slay the demon hordes and reach Soul Edge. Kilik uses his Kali-Yuga to defeat Nightmare, but immediately afterward, Xianghua is pulled into an ethereal void to face Inferno. Her weapon unveils herself as the holy sword and Xianghua defeats Inferno after a fierce struggle. As the void started to collapse, she carries Kilik out of it, though her sword is left behind. A mysterious man awards her with an unnamed jian in return for the great deed she has done. Xianghua keeps her role in Soul Edge's destruction secret and never reports it, but is stripped of her rank and reassigned to a menial position for her failure to retrieve the \\"Hero's Sword\\". Four years later (the timeline of Soulcalibur II, Soulcalibur III and Soulcalibur IV), news reach her that the Emperor destroyed and massacred Xiwei, the center of government in the Empire's western territory under the public justification of a revolt, believing that the fortress had been withholding Soul Edge from him. He asks Xianghua to investigate the ruins as her experience could be useful in locating the sword. Though she believed that she had destroyed Soul Edge, pieces of it are rumored to exist in this place and so Xianghua decides to find every fragment and destroy them. She left on a second journey alone, convinced that this was a burden she has to bear after she failed to destroy Soul Edge completely the first time. During her adventure, Xianghua is reunited with Kilik, who is attacked and gravely injured by Zasalamel. Xianghua takes him back to his home and, after leaving a letter for him, she departs seeking an old general whom Edge Master has arranged for her to meet. Training with the general, Xianghua's skills improve significantly but she is unable to shake off an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy due to her failure to help Kilik. On the general's sage advice, she then begins to train her mind to become more fluid and allow her heart to filter in both the good and the bad. After months of training, she feels that she was ready and bid farewell to the general, beginning her journey anew to fight by herself. While traveling west on the Silk Road, she reunites with Kilik. Together they travel to India to find Maxi, but he does not join them. Xianghua swears to destroy the Soul Edge properly and once and for all. A few years later, Xianghua again reunites and connects with Kilik, but he considers this the result of an unfortunate destiny, and eventually disappears. Returning to her homeland with a broken heart, Xianghua realizes she is pregnant. However, her grandfather and patriarch of the Chai house is furious at this, as Xianghua is the second generation of women from such a distinguished family to bear the child of an unknown man, and she is ordered to kill the child and marry into another family. Xianghua is rescued by the heir of the Yan family, Yan Wujin, who issues a condition for marrying Xianghua and not revealing the scandal, to allow the child, a boy named Xiba, to live (Xiba was then raised by Kong Xiuqiang). She later gave Wujin a daughter named Leixia (a Soulcalibur V character). A young Xianghua returns in the reboot game Soulcalibur VI. Her story mode revolves around how she became a member of the Imperial Guard, and the main story gives further detail on how she met Kilik and Maxi, joining them on their journey to defeat Nightmare and destroy Soul Edge. = Other = In the Soulcalibur manga adaptation, Xianghua meets Edge Master in the middle of her journey.Soulcalibur Manga Comic Volume 2 (Act 10). Later, Xianghua and Li Long's sister Meimei are forced to fight through a Lizardmen invasion of an Indian town and Meimei is killed in battle. Xianghua is rescued by Kilik and Maxi in their first meeting, and her Krita-Yuga suddenly transforms into the Soul Calibur, destroying the Lizardmen.Soulcalibur Manga Comic Volume 3 (Act 14).Soulcalibur Manga Comic Volume 3 (Act 15). Xianghua figurines have been released in Japan by several manufacturers, including Duck Tail, Epoch, Wave, and Yujin. Character design During Xianghua's early design phase, several concepts were considered for her attire, before settling upon a light and oriental appearance for her. Additionally it was considered to have her appear as a young girl instead, or alternatively for her to fight unarmed using martial arts, an idea later put to effect through Tekken character Heihachi Mishima in his guest appearance in Soulcalibur II. Xianghua would become more feminized in her clothing over the course of the series.Transnational Contexts of Culture, Gender, Class, and Colonialism in Play: Video Games in East Asia p. 164. Xiānghuà means \\"fragrant flower\\" in Chinese if each character is taken literally.Chái (柴) is a Chinese surname that can also mean \\"firewood\\". Xiāng (香) is \\"fragrant\\" and Huà (花) can mean \\"flower\\". She is officially described as \\"Flower in the Breeze\\" and uses an elegant fighting style based on a nimble footwork. As a tribute for the acclaimed Soulcalibur player Kayane, whose favourite character (and even a role model) was Xianghua, Namco created a tribute AI named \\"Kayane\\" in Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny, imitating her playing style. Xianghua's fighting style was eventually given to her teenage daughter Yan Leixia in Soulcalibur V. (Comparing the two characters, Kayane opined that while Leixia seems unfinished, she displays some individual characteristics and is not merely \\"a simple copy\\" of Xianghua.) Gameplay Gameplay-wise, Xianghua is regarded as one of the better characters in Soulcalibur II. GamePro guide to Soulcalibur II lists her strong points as having \\"excellent speed and evasive characteristics\\" and \\"a solid 8-way run offensive\\" even as she \\"can often rely too heavily on specific moves.\\" In Andrew Alfonso's GameSpy guide, she is described as a character \\"that can win without too much effort. Xianghua is definitely not a hard character to learn, and a lot of her strengths come through poking and landing launchers for combos.\\" Similarly, Eurogamer's Matt Edwards opined that Xianghua in this game \\"trounces most of the competition thanks to her safe pressure and decent combos.\\" BradyGames' official guide also noted that, unlike a fellow \\"up-close fighter\\" Talim, \\"Xianghua can deal a nice bit of damage\\" with her attacks.Michael Lummis, Paul Edwards. Soul Calibur II: Official Fighter's Guide (page 23). According to Hardcore Gamer, while Xianghua in Soulcalibur IV \\"is still unpredictable and juggle-happy, and does more damage than she used to—in exchange, she’s been given more recovery time on her moves (...) and her old juggle tactics are tougher to pull off.\\" Reception The character has been mostly very well received by game critics and has been noted for her sex appeal. Both David Rakoff of The New York Times and Darek Pasturczak of Wirtualna Polska called her \\"beautiful but deadly.\\" Dreamcast Magazine ranked her as the seventh top \\"girl on the Dreamcast\\" in 2000, commenting: \\"With an oriental flavour to her moves and style, Xianghua is a bit of a minx even though she looks sweet and innocent.\\"Dreamcast Magazine issue 5 page 102. GameSpy's Dave Kosak joked that a better translation of Xianghua's victory one-liner could be \\"Don't you want to just lick me up and down like a popsicle?\\" and GamesRadar's Shane Petterson described her official artwork for Soulcalibur IV as \\"screwing you with her eyes.\\" Arcade Sushi's John Llewellyn Martin called Xianghua one of the series' \\"most beloved characters\\" and Kotaku's Alex Jaffe listed her among \\"the world's best fighting characters\\". According to IGN's Jesse Schedeen \\"Xianghua may be traditional in some ways, but she certainly doesn't dress like it. She has one of the more unique costumes in Soulcalibur IV, a hodgepodge of different Oriental fashions that come together in one sexy look. Never before has a kung fu hero been such a babe.\\" In 2014, Julia Cook of Paste ranked Xianghua as the second \\"best dressed lady\\" in all video games for her collection of varied \\"tight outfits with flowy, feminine accoutrements\\" from \\"brightly colored capris under dresses or robes, sometimes with a sleek tiara\\" in early games to \\"a more masculine blazer and shorts combination for Soul Calibur IV.\\" GamePro, on the other hand, criticized her looks that \\"can't kill\\" as compared to the designs of the other female characters of Soulcalibur II. Some like GameSpy's Kosak as well as Crunchyroll's Nate Ming also expressed annoyance of Wendee Lee's \\"barely-repressed Flatbush accent\\" in the English voice track versions. Soulcalibur V was widely criticized for removing several fan-favourite classic characters, including Xianghua. Nevertheless, Thomas Nickel of Eurogamer Germany opined Leixia \\"represents an equivalent replacement of Xianghua.\\" See also *List of Soulcalibur characters References Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional Ming dynasty people Category:Fictional characters from Beijing Category:Fictional Chinese people in video games Category:Fictional Chinese secret agents Category:Fictional police officers Category:Fictional nobility Category:Fictional jianke Category:Fictional tai chi practitioners Category:Musician characters in video games Category:Namco protagonists Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:Fictional secret agents and spies in video games Category:Singer characters in video games Category:Fictional soldiers in video games Category:Soulcalibur series characters Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters introduced in 1998 Category:Woman soldier and warrior characters in video games ","title":"Chai Xianghua"},{"id":"2276040","text":"The name Terry has been used for two tropical cyclones worldwide.

Novalja Novalja () is a town in the north of the island of Pag in the Croatian part of Adriatic Sea. In recent times, Novalja has become famous because of the Zrće Beach.  History  The earliest settlers on the island were an Illyrian tribe that came to the region in the Bronze Age; traces of their settlement can still be seen around Pag. In the 1st century BC, the Romans took possession, and have left numerous archeological and cultural artifacts. Novalja is the successor of a Roman city called Cissa, considered by many scholars to be the seat of an ancient Christian bishopric of that name. Others prefer to identify the see with an island city of the same name in Istria, close to present-day Rovinj. A bishop of Cissa named Vindemius took part in some year between 571 and 577 in a schismatic synod in Grado called by Patriarch Elias of Aquileia. Arrested by the Exarch of Ravenna he was forced to abjure his views on the controversy of the Three Chapters, but once free from Byzantine Empire control reaffirmed his position and took part in another schismatic synod in 590. A bishop of Cissa called Ursinus took part in a synod at Rome in 680 and signed the acts. Soon after, Cissa ceased to exist, perhaps because of an earthquake.Francesco Lanzoni, Le diocesi d'Italia dalle origini al principio del secolo VII (an. 604), vol. II, Faenza 1927, p. 850Francesco Babudri, Il vescovato di Cissa in Istria, in Atti e memorie della società istriana di archeologia e storia patria, vol. XXXI (1919), pp. 33-57R. van Doren, v. Cissa, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques, vol. XII, Parigi 1953, col. 851 No longer a residential bishopric, Cissa is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 870 The Croats arrived in the 7th century along with the great migration and settled in the area. The island was for some time under the rule of the Croatian kingdom. Yet the island was always fought over, and in the 11th and 12th centuries was divided between the communities of Rab and of Zadar. Novalja was given to the community and diocese of Rab by Croatian King Petar Krešimir IV. From the 12th to 14th centuries, Novalja, along with other Dalmatian towns and islands, was fiercely contested between the Republic of Venice and the Croatian-Hungarian rulers. For four centuries from the start of the 15th century it was held by Venice, until Venice lost its independence. Austria and France then fought over the Dalmatian area with victory going to the Austrians. The island passed from Austria to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I, and then to the Independent State of Croatia (1941–1945). After the Second World War it returned to Yugoslavia and, when this broke up, it became part of the new state of Croatia. Unusually, the island is divided between two counties, with Novalja and Stara Novalja being part of the northern Lika-Senj County.

As of 2020 the Anglican Communion (as recognised by the Anglican Consultative Council) consists of 865 dioceses and 18 additional Ordinary jurisdictions (see list below) giving a total of 883 bishops; this total includes 77 archbishops (or equivalents, such as 'Presiding Bishop'), of whom 41 have the status of 'primate', and membership of the Primates' Meeting. There are, additionally, many suffragan or assistant bishops, as well as bishops of non-Anglican churches that are also in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury through arrangements such as the Porvoo Communion. There is also a number of bishops in different denominations of the Continuing Anglican movement. Continuing Anglicanism is outside the Anglican Communion. Archbishops=Primates and metropolitans= Primatial archbishops shown at first level, and additional metropolitan archbishops (of the same national or regional church) at second level (indented). The most common title for Primates and Metropolitans is 'Archbishop', but some of those listed, whilst carrying out a similar function, bear an alternative title (such as Presiding Bishop, or Bishop Primus) for historical reasons. *Archbishop of Alexandria *Archbishop of Armagh (Primate of all Ireland) **Archbishop of Dublin *Archbishop Primate of Australia (Primate, elected from amongst the following five metropolitans) **Archbishop of Adelaide **Archbishop of Brisbane **Archbishop of Melbourne **Archbishop of Sydney **Archbishop of Perth, Australia *Primate Bishop of Bangladesh *Primate Bishop of Brazil *Archbishop of Burundi *Metropolitan Bishop of Calcutta (this Bishopric ceased to have Metropolitical status after 1970) *Archbishop Primate of Canada (Primate, in addition to the following four metropolitans) **Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province of British Columbia & the Yukon **Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province of Canada **Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province of Ontario **Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province of Rupert's Land *Archbishop of Canterbury (Primate of all England) **Archbishop of York *Archbishop of Cape Town *Archbishop of Central Africa *Archbishop of Central America *Archbishop of Chile *Archbishop of Congo (Episcopal see fixed at Kinshasa) *Archbishop of Hong Kong *Archbishop of the Indian Ocean *Bishop Primate of Japan *Archbishop in Jerusalem (see next section) *President Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East *Archbishop of All Kenya (Episcopal see fixed at Nairobi, and called 'All Saints Cathedral Diocese') *Archbishop of Korea (Episcopal see fixed at Seoul) *Archbishop of Melanesia (Episcopal see fixed at Honiara, and called 'Central Melanesia') *Presiding Bishop of Mexico *Archbishop of Myanmar (Episcopal see fixed at Yangon) *Archbishop Primate of New Zealand (Primate, elected from amongst the following three metropolitans) **Co-Archbishop of New Zealand for the Māori Tikanga (Archbishop chosen from amongst the five Māori personal prelatures - see below) **Co-Archbishop of New Zealand for the Pakeha Tikanga (Archbishop chosen from amongst the New Zealand mainland dioceses) **Co- Archbishop of New Zealand for the Polynesian Tikanga (Episcopal see fixed at Polynesia) *Archbishop Primate of All Nigeria (Primate, elected from amongst the following fourteen metropolitans) **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Aba **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Abuja **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Bendel **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Enugu **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Ibadan **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Jos **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Kaduna **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Kwara **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Lagos **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Lokoja **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Niger Delta **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Ondo **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Owerri **Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Niger *Bishop Moderator of North India *Bishop Moderator of Pakistan *Archbishop of Papua New Guinea *Prime Bishop of the Philippines *Archbishop of Rwanda (Episcopal see fixed at Gasabo) *Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church *Archbishop of South East Asia *Bishop Moderator of South India *Presiding Bishop of South America *Archbishop of South Sudan (Primate, in addition to the following eight metropolitans) (Episcopal see fixed at Juba) **Archbishop of Amadi **Archbishop of Central Equatoria **Archbishop of Eastern Bahr el Ghazal **Archbishop of Eastern Equatoria **Archbishop of Jonglei **Archbishop of Northern Bahr el Ghazal **Archbishop of Upper Nile **Archbishop of Western Equatoria *Archbishop of Sudan (Episcopal see fixed at Khartoum) *Archbishop of Tanzania *Archbishop of Uganda (Episcopal see fixed at Kampala) *Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, USA *Archbishop of Wales *Archbishop of West Africa (Primate, always the longest-serving of the two metropolitans shown below) **Metropolitan Archbishop of West Africa **Metropolitan Archbishop of Ghana *Archbishop of the West Indies =Non-metropolitan= Non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees are rarer in Anglicanism than in other historic denominations.

After gaining the distinction of England schoolboy honours in 2001, this tall and agile player was signed up by his local club Bolton under the Academy scholarship scheme where he would spend three years under the supervision of the youth coaching team. He was given a four-year professional contract in 2005 as the understudy to more senior keepers at Bolton such as Jussi Jääskeläinen, Ian Walker and Ali Al Habsi. Fun Fact.

In January 2006, Howarth joined Stockport County on a month- long loan, but returned to Bolton without any first team experience. Howarth was linked with a season-long loan move to St Johnstone in July 2006, but after a trial the Saints dropped their interest in Howarth. In the beginning of the 2006/2007 season Howarth joined Oldham Athletic on a month-long loan, making his debut in a game against Swansea City, saving a penalty taken by Swansea icon Lee Trundle. He has since returned to The Reebok. On 22 March 2007 Horwarth joined Carlisle United on loan until the end of the 2006–07 season after Tony Williams' loan move to Wrexham.

The Lorwama tribe's language (Okolye or okolie) is spoken mainly by Lorwama natives, though it was adopted by the Ketebo people in the 1940s when their language vanished. The Ketebo people are now integrated into the Lorwama community, though they speak a slight variant of okolie. The Dongotono Lango dialect speaking group also speak Okolie, importing some words from the otuho language of the Lotuko people. It is good to note that the Name Lorwama came as a result of treaty done probably in 1920s between the today called people Ketebo which means people who can eat meat with hard mixed porridge called Taffa. The original name for the tribe is OKOL people. So in many case as the people are getting into self evolutions, it always became an issue to deal with when it comes to who is a Lango? Is the name lango referring to the Lorwama, Lango or it is a name that unite the SIX groups? Instead of following the politicized individuals who think by dividing these six united people can give them more room for power, I suggest that any reader here should go back and know when in history were these people called Lango and who named them? Uganda is just another short place to trace from, but Kenya is the origin as many elderly people can witness. Alternative spellings The name \\"Lango\\" can also be spelled as Langgo or Langoni when referring to a male, or as Langoni for a female.

It begins in County Sligo in the northwest of Ireland, and ends at Blacklion, County Cavan, at the border with Northern Ireland, where it becomes the A4 road. At , The N16 is one of the shorter national primary routes, as it forms only part of a major route from Sligo to Enniskillen and onwards to Belfast. Route The N16 begins at the junction of the N15 at Cartron, Sligo, and travels northeast, past the Institute of Technology, Sligo and onwards, passing above Glencar Lake and entering County Leitrim. Manorhamilton and Glenfarne are the only towns passed through in County Leitrim, until the road reaches Blacklion in County Cavan, and crosses the border into County Fermanagh at Belcoo, where the road becomes the A4. The route continues to Enniskillen and further east towards Belfast as the A4 and the M1 Motorway. Compared with many other national primary roads in Ireland, long sections of the N16 are narrow and twisty which can make travelling on it slow and difficult. In recent years improvements have been made to short sections of it but the geography of many of the areas it passes through (deep valleys and steep hills) places some limits on the improvements that can be made without a wholesale realignment of parts of the route (i.e., finding less difficult terrain nearby to build a new road through). Upgrades to more sections of the N16 are planned.

Born in Des Moines, Iowa, he is best known as one of two original guitarists in Slipknot. Steele co-founded Slipknot in 1995, performing on the band's debut demo Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.. He left in 1996 and was replaced by Craig \\"133\\" Jones, but later rejoined in 2011 as the touring bassist following the 2010 death of Paul Gray. Steele was part of the recording sessions for the band's 2014 album .5: The Gray Chapter, but left at some point before the album was finished and was replaced by Alessandro Venturella. According to Jim Root, some of Steele's bass tracks were used for the album though he did not specify which tracks feature Steele on bass. Career=1995–1997: Early career and Slipknot= Donnie Steele began his career as a member of Des Moines, Iowa-based death metal band Body Pit, in which fellow future Slipknot members Anders Colsefni (vocals), Mick Thomson (guitar) and Paul Gray (bass) had all performed. He later co-founded Slipknot in September 1995, alongside Colsefni, second guitarist Josh \\"Gnar\\" Brainard, Gray, drummer Joey Jordison and percussionist Shawn \\"Clown\\" Crahan. He was described by Brainard as \\"a pretty technical guitar player\\" and \\"one of those multi- talented guys\\". Author Joel McIver partly credits Steele with the introduction of jazz elements to the band's sound, describing the guitarist as a \\"self- confessed jazzbo\\". In early 1996, after the recording of the band's debut demo Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat., Steele began to miss a number of Slipknot rehearsal sessions. The other band members attempted to track the guitarist down, but had to continue on without him, until one of them later saw him by chance and was told that he no longer wanted to be in the group. According to Brainard, Steele \\"felt that playing with Slipknot was against his Christian beliefs\\"; the rest of the band respected the guitarist's reasons for choosing to leave, although both Brainard and Colsefni have criticised his lack of communication regarding his decision to do so. With concerts forthcoming, Steele was quickly replaced by Craig Jones. =2011–2014: Return to Slipknot on bass= Following the death of Gray in May 2010, Slipknot took a brief hiatus and later announced that Steele would replace the bassist for upcoming tour dates. In an official statement, the band explained that \\"Donnie was in the band at the very beginning, and rather than get an outsider, we thought it would be a fitting tribute to Paul to play with someone from within the family\\". Speaking about his return to the band, percussionist Shawn \\"Clown\\" Crahan explained that the decision to invite Steele to replace Gray \\"felt completely comfortable\\", adding that the band was \\"not gonna have some jackass from another band come into our world ... Donnie's family. Donnie's from the stone of the 'Knot\\". During live performances, Steele remained backstage out of sight of the crowd. Despite praising him for fitting back into Slipknot well, Crahan justified this decision by asking \\"What gives him the right to be onstage with us right now?\\", elaborating that \\"When we're going through an experience like this with our fans, they need to concentrate on the eight members that are grieving, not on someone new\\". Steele decided to leave the band during the recording sessions for \\".5: The Gray Chapter\\", and was replaced by Alessandro Venturella in 2014, he recorded some bass parts for the album according to guitarist Jim Root. =Other projects and contributions= Aside from Slipknot, Donnie Steele formed the death metal group Killpact in 2001 with vocalist Rick Funderburk, bassist Steve Pundzak and drummer Ernie McGinn (who had previously performed in Body Pit). In an interview with MFKR1, a website dedicated to the early incarnations of Slipknot, he described the band as \\"a mixture of death metal, 80's thrash and shred with a strong emphasis on hooks\\". In 2016, Steele made a guest appearance contributing some solos for the debut album by Des Moines-based groove metal band Murder Earth, Waiting (For the End of Man), following the departure of guitarist Ryan Thornton.

The Moroccan Quarter – primarily in cell J9 – in the 1947 Survey of Palestine map. The two demolished mosques are shown in red. The Moroccan Quarter or Mughrabi Quarter ( Hārat al-Maghāriba, , Sh'khunat HaMughrabim) was a 770-year-old neighborhood in the southeast corner of the Old City of Jerusalem, bordering on the western wall of the Temple Mount on the east, the Old City walls on the south (including the Dung Gate) and the Jewish Quarter to the west. It was an extension of the Muslim Quarter to the north, and was founded as an endowed Islamic waqf or religious property by a son of Saladin in the late 12th century. The quarter was razed by Israeli forces, at the behest of Teddy Kollek, the mayor of West Jerusalem, three days after the Six-Day War in order to broaden the narrow alley leading to the Western Wall and prepare it for public access by Jews seeking to pray there. It is now the site of the Western Wall Plaza. History=Ayyubid and Mamluk eras= According to the 15th-century historian Mujir ad-Dīn, soon after the Arabs had wrested back Jerusalem from the Crusaders the quarter was established in 1193 by Saladin's son al-Malik al-Afḍal Nurud-Dīn 'Ali, as a waqf (a mortmain consisting of a charitable trust) dedicated to all Moroccan immigrants. The boundaries of this ḥārat or quarter, according to a later document, were the outer wall of the Haram al-Sharif to the east; south to the public thoroughfare leading to the Siloan spring; west as far as the residence of the qadi of Jerusalem, Shams al-Din; the northern limit ran to the Arcades of Umm al-Banat, otherwise known as the Qanṭarat Umam al-Banāt/Wilson's Arch causeway. It was set aside for \\"the benefit of all the community of the Moroccans of all description and different occupations, male and female, old and young, the low and the high, to settle on it in its residences and to benefit from its uses according to their different needs.\\" Soon after, Jews, many also from North Africa, were also allowed to settle in the city. By 1303, Moroccans were well established there, a fact attested by the endowment of a Zāwiyah, or religious institution such as a monastery, made by 'Umar Ibn Abdullah Ibn 'Abdun-Nabi al-Maṣmūdi al-Mujarrad for this quarter. Al-Afḍal's waqf was not only religious and charitable in its aims, but also provided for the establishment of a madrassa law school there, thereafter called eponymously the Afḍaliyyah, for the benefit of the Malikite Islamic jurists (fuqaha) in the city. A distinguished scion of a Spanish Sufi family of mystics, Abū Madyan, settled in Jerusalem in the early 14th century, and made another major endowment, of a Zāwiyah near the Bāb al-Silsilah, or Chain Gate, of the Haram, for the Moroccans in 1320. This consisted in a waqf property at 'Ain Kārim and another at Qanṭarat Umam al-Banāt at the Gate of the Chain, -the latter as a hospice exclusively for newly arrived immigrants- the usufruct (manfa'ah) of both to be set aside in perpetuity for the Moroccans in Jerusalem.Burgoyne, 1987, p. 69 The Qanṭarat Umam al-Banāt endowment consisted of a hall, two apartments, a yard, private conveniences, and, below, a store and a cave (qabw). Attached to the document was a stipulation that the properties be placed, after the donor's death, under the care of an administrator (mutawalli) and supervisor (nāzir) selected on the basis of the community's recognition of his outstanding qualities of piety and wisdom. The Ain Karim properties alone were extensive, 15,000 dunams, and covered most of the village. Some time in the early 1350s, a third waqf was instituted by the Marinid Dynasty Moroccan King 'Ali Ibn 'Uthmān Ibn Ya'qūb Ibn 'Abdul-Ḥaqq al- Marini. This consisted of a codex of the Qur'an copied by his own hand Further endowments to the quarter took place in 1595 and 1630. Until the advent of Muslims in Jerusalem, most of the area below the Western Wall was crammed with rubble, and Jewish prayer throughout the Islamic period appears to have been performed inside synagogues in the Jewish Quarter, or, on public occasions, on the Mount of Olives. The narrow space dividing the Western Wall from the houses of the Moroccan Quarter was created at the behest of Suleiman the Magnificent in the sixteenth century in order to allow prayers to be said there. =Ottoman era= An aerial view of the Jewish and Moroccan quarters, circa 1937 photograph. Moroccan neighborhood dwellings (left) bordering the Western Wall (right), circa 1898–1914. View towards north. The Ottoman taxation registers listed 13 households in the quarter in 1525–26, 69 households, 1 bachelor and 1 imam in 1538–39, 84 households and 11 bachelors in 1553–34, 130 households and 2 bachelors in 1562–63, and 126 households and 7 bachelors in 1596–97. Originally developed for Moroccans, over the centuries Jewish, Christian and Muslim people from Palestine and elsewhere had at various times taken up residence there. By the time Israel decided to demolish their houses, roughly half of the zone's inhabitants could trace their origins back to Moroccan immigrants. According to the French traveler Chateaubriand who visited in 1806, some of the residents of the quarter were descended from Moors who had been expelled from Spain in the late 15th century. They had been well received by the local community and a mosque had been built for them. Residents of the neighborhood held on to their culture in the way of food, clothing and traditions until it became assimilated with the rest of the Old City in the 19th century. Thus it also became a natural place of stay to Moroccans who came on pilgrimage to the al-Aqsa Mosque. Over the years a small number of schools and mosques were established in the quarter and Muslim clerics who performed religious duties at the al-Aqsa Mosque lived there. The site of Jewish prayer and lamentation was a stretch of some 30 metres along the wall, accessed via a narrow passage from King David's Street. In depth from the wall the paved area extended 11 feet. At the southern end lay one of the two zāwiyyah dedicated there in medieval times and the lane to the Wailing Wall sector ended in a blind alley closed off by the houses of the Moroccan beneficiaries. In 1840 a proposal by a British Jew, the first attempt to change the status quo, was conveyed via the British consul, and requested that Jews be allowed to repave the 120 sq. metre area. The plan was rejected both by the Abu Madyan waqf administrator and by Muhammad Ali Pasha. Moslems in the area also complained of the excessive noise, as opposed to past practice, caused by recent Jewish pilgrims. Jews at prayer were asked to continue their traditional practices quietly, and to refrain from proclaiming on doctrinal matters there. By the beginning of the 19th century Jewish worshippers were rare, and according to Yehoshua Ben Arieh, lacked any special distinction. In an account of his travels to the Holy Land in 1845, T. Tobler noted the existence of a mosque in the Moroccan quarter. According to Yeohoshua Ben- Arieh, the Moroccans regarded the Jews as infidels. They were subjected to harassment and were required to pay a sum in exchange for the right to pray there undisturbed. Increased friction at the site between Jews and Muslims arose with the onset of Zionism and the resulting fear among the Muslims that the Jews would claim the entire Temple Mount. Attempts were made at various times, by Moses Montefiore and Baron Rothschild to buy the whole area, without success. In 1887 Rothschild's bid to purchase the Quarter came with a project to rebuild it as \\"a merit and honor to the Jewish People\\" relocating the inhabitants in better accommodation elsewhere. The Ottoman authorities appeared to be ready to give their approval. According to some sources, the highest secular and Muslim religious authorities in Jerusalem, such as the Mutasarrıf or Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Şerif Mehmed Rauf Paşa, and the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Tahir Husseini, actually gave their approval. The plan foundered on Jewish, rather than Muslim objections was shelved after the chief rabbinical Haham of the Jerusalemite Sephardi community stated that he had had a \\"providential intimation\\" that, were the sale to go through, a terrible massacre of Jews would ensue. His opinion might have reflected a Sephardi fear that the Ashkenazis would thereby take possession of the holiest site in Judaism. In the first two months after the Ottoman Empire's entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the quarter to Jews, requesting a sum of £20,000 which, he said, would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. =British Mandate era= A hospice, the Dar al-Magharibah, existed in the quarter to extend lodgings for Moroccan Muslims on pilgrimage to the Islamic sites of Jerusalem. In April 1918, Chaim Weizmann, then a prominent Zionist leader on a visit to Jerusalem, sent a letter via Ronald Storrs offering the sheikhs £70,000 in exchange for the Wall and the buildings of the Moroccan quarter. This was immediately rejected when the Muslim authorities got wind of the proposal. Nothing daunted, Weizmann then addressed his petition to Arthur Balfour, asking him to resolve the issue by ruling in favour of the Jews. In a letter of 30 May that year, headed THE HANDING OVER OF THE WAILING WALL TO THE JEWS, he gave his reasons as follows: > We Jews have many holy places in Palestine, but the Wailing Wall-believed to > be part of the old Temple Wall-is the only one which is in some sense left > to us. All the others are in the hands of Christians or Moslems. And even > the Wailing Wall is not really ours. It is surrounded by a group of > miserable, dirty cottages and derelict buildings, which make the whole place > from the hygienic point of view a positive danger, and from the sentimental > point of view a source of constant humiliation to the Jews of the world. Our > most sacred monument, in our most sacred city, is in the hands of some > doubtful Moghreb religious community, which keeps these cottages as a source > of income. We are willing to compensate this community very liberally, but > we should like the place to be cleaned up; we should like to give it a > dignified and respectable appearance.' The wall as well as the Moroccan Quarter nonetheless, throughout the British Mandatory period, remained Waqf property, while Jews retained their longstanding right to visit it. During the 1929 Palestine riots Jews and Muslims did however clash over competing claims on the area adjacent to the Moroccan Quarter, with Jews denying they had no aims regarding the Haram al- Sharif but demanding the British authorities expropriate and raze the Moroccan quarter. Jewish Moroccan and Muslim Moroccan pilgrims, both groups on a visit to Jerusalem, were present at the riots, and several of the former were killed or injured. Great Britain appointed a commission under the approval of the League of Nations to settle the issue. The Commission again reaffirmed the status quo, while placing certain restrictions on activities, including forbidding Jews from conducting the Yom Kippur prayers (the holiest holiday in Judaism), which involved the blowing of the Shofar, and Muslims from carrying out the Dhikr (Islamic prayers) close to the wall or to cause annoyance to the Jews. =Jordanian era= When Jordanian forces emerged as the victors in the battle for possession of the Old City in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, 1,500 Jewish residents, coinciding with the flight or expulsion of 70,000 Palestinians from Israeli-occupied areas of Jerusalem, were expelled from the Jewish Quarter, which was in the vicinity of the Moroccan zone. Disputes were not infrequent between the quarter's inhabitants and Palestinian landlords, squabbling over property rights. In 1965, Palestinian squatters in Jewish properties on the edge of the Moroccan Quarter were evicted by the Jordanian government and resettled in the Shu'afat refugee camp, four kilometers north of the Old City. The motives behind this ejection are unknown. According to French historian Vincent Lemire, during the period of Jordanian control the French Fourth and Fifth Republics claimed extraterritorial jurisdiction over the Waqf Abu Madyan, an Algerian waqf located in the Moroccan Quarter. France had claimed jurisdiction over the waqf on 6 July 1949. In the aftermath of the Arab–Israeli War, Israel annexed the village of Ein Karem. The Waqf Abu Madyan depended on the village's agricultural output for income and was thus left in a precarious financial situation, precipitating France's sovereignty claim. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs used its position in Jerusalem to curry favor with Israel, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco by providing financial support to the waqf and, therefore, North African Muslim pilgrims. For example, in 1954 French intellectual Louis Massignon organized a charitable collection at the gates of the Great Mosque of Tlemcen in Algeria in support of the waqf in an effort to improve Franco-Algerian relations. On 12 February 1962—four days after the Charonne Métro station massacre and about one month prior to the signing of the Évian Accords, a ceasefire agreement between France and Algeria—France abandoned its claim to the waqf. Demolition \\"Wailing Wall\\", July 1967 =Preparations= The razing of the quarter took place without any official authorization. Credit for demolishing the Moroccan Quarter is contested between several figures: Teddy Kollek, Moshe Dayan, Colonel Shlomo Lahat, Uzi Narkiss and David Ben-Gurion. The precise details of how the operation was carried out are not clear, since no paper trail was left by the participants. According to one source, the retired Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion played a pivotal role in the decision to demolish the quarter. He visited the Wall on 8 June, with Teddy Kollek, Shimon Peres and Ya'akov Yannai, head of the National Parks Authority at the time Ben- Gurion was upset at sighting a sign in Arabic on 9 June, the day after the Old City had been captured and protested at the presence of a sign in Arabic. > He noticed a tile sign in front of the Wall, which read \\"Al-Burak Road\\" in > English and Arabic but not in Hebrew. It was a reminder of the prophet > Mohammad's legendary horse, Buraq, left tethered by the Wall as the prophet > took his journey to heaven from the famous rock above. Ben-Gurion looked at > the sign with disapproval and asked if anyone had a hammer. A soldier tried > to pry off the tile with a bayonet, but Ben-Gurion was concerned about > damage to the stone. An axe was produced and the name on the tile carefully > removed. The symbolism of expunging Arabic from the redeemed Jewish holy > site was not lost on the surrounding crowd, or on Ben-Gurion. They cheered, > and Ben-Gurion exclaimed, \\"This is the greatest moment of my life since I > came to Israel.\\" Ben-Gurion also proposed the following day that the walls of the Old City be demolished since they weren't Jewish, but the government did not take up the idea. Teddy Kollek in his memoirs wrote that it was necessary to knock down the quarter because a pilgrimage to the wall was being organized with hundreds of thousands of Jews, and their passage through the \\"dangerous narrow alleys\\" of the \\"slum hovels\\" was unthinkable: they needed a clear bright space to celebrate their return to the site after 19 years. To that end, archaeologists and planners had examined the area the day before to map out what had to be demolished. The operations had a larger scope, not only to clear the Mughrabi quarter, but also expel all the Palestinian inhabitants of the contiguous, predominantly Arab-owned Jewish Quarter, who, he claimed, had 'no special feeling for the place and would be satisfied to receive ample compensation for their expulsion. The Jerusalem Post described the area as a jumble of hovels on the same day bulldozing operations began, and a writer later commented on this designation as follows: > The day the bulldozing began the quarter was described in The Jerusalem Post > as a slum. Two days later it was reported as having been by and large > abandoned during the siege. I expect in time that its existence will vanish > altogether from the pages of developing Zionist history. Shlomo Lahat, who had just flown back from a fund-raising campaign in South America, recalled that on his arrival at 4 am 7 June, Moshe Dayan informed him of the imminent conquest of Jerusalem, and that he wanted Lahat, a stickler for discipline, as military governor of the city. He needed someone \\"prepared to shoot Jews if need be\\". Once the city was taken, at a meeting involving himself, Dayan, Kollek and Uzi Narkiss, Lahat suggested that the programmed visit of Jews on Shavuot meant that there would be a crush of people crowding in, risking a higher casualty rate than that sustained by the war, and suggested the area be cleared, an idea that met Dayah's approval. This is disputed by Ya'akov Salman who stated that it was he who raised the problem of the courtyard's limitations. =Demolition= There were 135 houses in the quarter, and the destruction left at least 650 people refugees. According to one surviving eyewitness, after its capture by Israel, the entire Old City was placed under a strict curfew. On Saturday evening 10 June, the last day of the Six-Day War, coinciding with the end of the Jewish Sabbath, a number of searchlights were positioned and floodlit up the quarter's warrens. Twenty odd Jerusalem building contractors, hired by Kollek, first knocked down a public lavatory with sledgehammers. Army bulldozers were then brought in to raze the houses. The residents were given either a few minutes, fifteen minutes or three hours to evacuate their homes. They initially refused to budge. In the face of this reluctance, lieutenant Colonel Ya'akov Salman, the deputy military governor, issued an order to an Engineering Corps officer to start bulldozing, and, on striking one particular structure, caused the whole building to collapse on its residents. It was this act which caused the remaining residents to flee their apartments and enter vehicles that were stationed outside to bus them away. Amidst the rubble, a middle-aged, or elderly woman, al-Hajjah Rasmiyyah 'Ali Taba'ki, was discovered in her death throes. One of the engineers, Yohanan Montsker, had her rushed to hospital but by midnight she was dead. According to an interview given two decades later by Eitan Ben-Moshe, the engineer attached to the IDF Central Command who oversaw the operation, she was not the only victim. He recalled recovering 3 bodies that were transported to the Bikur Cholim Hospital, and while some other bodies were buried with the disposed rubble: > I had thrown out all the garbage. We threw out the wreckage of houses > together with the Arab corpses. We threw Arab corpses and not Jewish, so > that they would not convert the area to a place where it is forbidden to > tread. The following morning, Colonel Lahat described the demolition workers as mostly being drunk \\"on wine and joy\\". Permission to salvage their personal belongings was denied. The reason given by an Israeli soldier was that they were pressed for time, since only two days remained before the feast of the \\"Passover\\" (actually Shavuot), and many Jews were expected to arrive on the following Tuesday at the Western Wall. The haste of demolition was necessary, it was argued, to prepare a yard for the festive worshippers. The prime minister at the time, Levi Eshkol was completely unaware of the operation, and phoned Narkiss on the 11th asking the reason why the houses were being demolished. Narkiss, pretending not to know, replied that he'd look into the matter. =Historic buildings razed= In addition to 135 houses, the demolition destroyed the Bou Medyan zaouia, the Sheikh Eid Mosque, – one of the few mosques remaining from the time of Saladin, whose historic significance was identified by the Israel Antiquities Authority. In destroying the small mosque near the Buraq section of the Wall, associated with the ascent of Mohammad on his steed Buraq to heaven, the engineer Ben Moshe is quoted as having exclaimed: \\"Why shouldn't the mosque be sent to Heaven, just as the magic horse did?\\" Two years later, another complex of buildings close to the wall, that included Madrasa Fakhriya (Fakhriyyah zawiyya) and the house in front of the Bab al-Magharibah that the Abu al-Sa'ud family had occupied since the 16th century but which had been spared in the 1967 destruction, were demolished in June 1969. The Abu al-Sa'ud building was a well-known example of Mamluk architecture, and there were several reasons given for its demolition. Its removal enabled Israeli archaeologists to excavate in the area; to provide open ground to enable the IDF to access the area rapidly should troubles arise at the Wall, and finally, while the antiquity of the housing complex was admitted, the fact too that extensive repairs to the roof and balconies had been made using railway track beams and concrete was adduced to assert that they had sufficient modern traces to be accidental to the area's history. Yasser Arafat's mother was of al-Sa'ud stock, and it appears that Arafat had lived in the house during his childhood, in the years 1933 to 1936. On 12 June, at a Ministerial Meeting on the Status of Jerusalem, when the issue of demolitions in the Old City was broached, the Justice Minister Ya'akov Shapira judged that: \\"They are illegal demolitions but it's good that they are being done.\\" Lieutenant Colonel Yaakov Salman, the deputy military governor in charge of the operation, aware of possible legal trouble on account of the Fourth Geneva Convention forearmed himself with documents from the East Jerusalem municipality testifying to the poor sanitary conditions in the neighborhood and Jordanian plans to eventually evacuate it. By the 14th, some 200,000 Israelis had come to visit the site. =Aftermath= On 18 April 1968, the Israeli government expropriated the land for public use and paid from 100 to 200 Jordanian dinars to each family that had been displaced. 41 heads of families who had been evicted from the area wrote to Kollek to thank him for his assistance in resettling them in better housing conditions. The rest of the families have refused compensation on the grounds that it would lend legitimacy to what Israel did to them. In the post-1967 period, many of the evicted refugees managed to emigrate to Morocco via Amman due to the intervention of King Hassan II. Other refugee families resettled in the Shu'afat refugee camp and other parts of Jerusalem. The prayer site was extended southwards to double its length from 28 to 60 meters, and the original plaza of four meters to 40 meters: the small 120 square meter area in front of the wall became the Western Wall Plaza, now in use as an open-air synagogue covering 20,000 square meters. In a letter to the United Nations, the Israeli government stated nine months later that the buildings were demolished after the Jordanian government had allowed the neighborhood to become a slum area. The expelled community continues to elect an administrator or mukhtar for the no-longer existing Moroccan Quarter.

The title refers to \\"O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon\\", a quote from the balcony scene in William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The collection was assembled from the US collections The Shape of Space and All the Myriad Ways. Story synopses (Sphere paperback edition) The 1974 Sphere paperback version of the collection only contained seven of the twelve stories originally included in the 1973 Gollancz hardback edition. =\\"Inconstant Moon\\"= First appearance: 1971 short story collection All the Myriad Ways. The short story won the 1972 Hugo Award for best short story. Stan, the narrator, notices that the Moon is glowing much brighter than ever before. The people he meets as the story begins all praise the Moon's increased beauty but lack the scientific background to understand its cause. However the narrator surmises that the Sun has gone nova, the day side of the Earth is already destroyed, and this is the last night of his life. He then calls and visits his girlfriend Leslie, presuming her ignorant of the situation, but she realizes it independently when Jupiter brightens with appropriate delay; they then enjoy their last night on the town, before rain and winds start. Later, he realizes one other possibility. In case he is right, they find appropriate supplies and seek refuge from the coming natural disasters in Leslie's high-rise apartment. The second possibility turns out to be correct: the Earth has \\"merely\\" been struck by an enormous solar flare—by far the worst disaster in human history, with most (if not all) people in the Eastern Hemisphere presumed dead, but humans in the Americas have a chance of surviving the cataclysm. The vaporized seawater leads to torrential rains, hurricanes and floods. The story ends at the break of an overcast, gray morning, with Leslie's apartment becoming an island among the raging flood waters, but with the narrator rather optimistically wondering \\"if our children would colonize Europe, or Asia, or Africa.\\" In 1996, the story was made into an episode of The Outer Limits television series written by Brad Wright. Jo Walton in 1997 wrote a short poem, \\"The End of the World in Duxford\\", as \\"an unauthorised version of 'Inconstant Moon', a British equivalent.\\" = \\"Bordered in Black\\" = First appearance: The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, April 1966. A prototype faster-than-light spacecraft crewed by two men is sent to the Sirius system, known from robotic exploration to include an earthlike world. In orbit around the world, they notice that one of the continents has a thin, strange border all the way round its coastline, which radiates a low heat and appears black in visible light. After exploring the edges of the smaller continents, and discovering that the ocean hosts only one lifeform—a single species of algae that they think might have been genetically engineered—they decide to explore the large continent with the border. When they discover just what the black border is—a seething mass of trapped humans with very dark skin, feeding off the algae and each other—the result is the death, by suicide, of one of the crew, and the self-destruction of the ship by the traumatized survivor upon his return to Earth—and a chilling reminder that there may be great danger waiting for further human explorers. The story ends on a hopeful note, with the project leader believing that Earth can help the humans at Sirius, and a fearful one, with the crewman then speculating that the humans were seeded by carnivorous aliens as food animals. In the notes to his collection Convergent Series, Niven wrote that \\"Bordered in Black\\" = \\"How the Heroes Die\\" = First appearance: Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1966. A Known Space story. The 15-man team setting up the first base on Mars experience tragedy when a murder is committed. Carter, the murderer, in the process of escaping on one of the transportation buggies crashes through the plastic bubble which holds in the base's atmosphere in an attempt to kill everyone else; however, it fails, and he is soon chased by Alf, the brother of the victim on another buggy. The lethal chase, with the two combatants in constant radio communication, slowly reveals the community stresses which resulted in the murder. Alf wants to kill Carter in revenge for his brother, while Carter wishes the same and to try once more to destroy the base ... but with limited oxygen in their tanks, the two men must ensure that they have enough left to return to base. = \\"At the Bottom of a Hole\\" = This story appeared originally on Galaxy Science Fiction, in December 1966. It is a Known Space story. A sequel to \\"How the Heroes Die\\". Muller, a smuggler with a cargo of precious magnetic monopoles, attempts to use Mars (the 'hole' of the title; to spacers, planets are merely gravity wells to be avoided if possible) as a means to whip his ship to a new orbit that will enable him to escape the customs authorities who are chasing him. His plan fails, and he crashlands, close to the now-abandoned base. Over the next few days, he explores the ruins and finds out the terrible story of what happened. Unfortunately, he himself suffers the same fate as the original colonists—all of which he commits to his log, which is later recovered. Niven's use of the term \\"gravity well\\" in the story is the third use of the phrase in science fiction recorded by Oxford English Dictionary researchers. The two Mars stories do belong to \\"Known Space\\" and they are specifically referred to and to some degree influence the plot of Protector, which takes place a long time later. Also, the failure of Mars colonization as depicted here contributes to the generally held opinion in that future history that planets (at least in the Solar System) are virtually worthless and it is asteroids which are the truly desirable real property. = \\"One Face\\" = First appearance: Galaxy Science Fiction, June 1965. During a routine hyperspace jump, an accident involving a small meteoroid striking into the machinery causes the ship to be trapped in a stasis until billions of years have passed. They emerge in the Solar System's far future, at which time the sun has become a greenish-white dwarf and Earth has lost its atmosphere and become a tidally locked world; i.e., it only presents one face to the sun. The ship's main computer has also been damaged, so its decision to have the captain replaced by one of the passengers to maximize survival causes disagreement. The damage to the ship prevents it traveling faster than light, and the passengers and crew debate using the ship's remaining sub-light engine to travel relativistically to a neighboring star to look for a more viable planet. Reluctantly, believing that any other similarly senescent star will offer no better option, the people accede to the new captain's order to land on Earth despite the lack of an atmosphere. However, this is not a haphazard decision by the new captain, who is an astrophysicist. He is convinced that there is a remnant atmosphere frozen on the dark side, and uses the ship's drive to begin to re-spin Earth. (The drive really is powerful enough to achieve this within a reasonable timescale, if only the planet's crust can withstand the seismic stresses without catastrophic earthquakes.) This will, he hopes, convert this frozen gas back to a breathable atmosphere. = \\"Becalmed in Hell\\" = First appearance: The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, July 1965. A Known Space story. A ship with a two-man crew—Howie, a normal human, and Eric, the disembodied brain of a seriously injured man who has been installed in the ship to serve as a living computer and control system—is exploring the upper atmosphere of Venus, using the empty fuel-tank as a dirigible device. About to return to Earth, Eric reveals that something is wrong with the ramjet that propels the craft, necessitating a landing in order to fix the problem. When Howie can find nothing physically wrong with the system, he can only conclude that, disturbingly, the problem is with Eric. He believes Eric has a psychosomatic disorder preventing him from operating the ramjets, using the analogy of a traumatized soldier that can no longer feel his hand and pull the trigger of a gun. After revealing his theory to Eric, Eric admits it is a possibility but insists that Howie keep inspecting the ship, reasoning that Howie is the only one that can check for mechanical problems. Howie agrees, but secretly has convinced himself that the problem is truly with Eric. In an effort to cure Eric using a placebo, Howie creates buckets of ice-water using the ship's freezer, and dumps it into the wiring panels on the wings, telling Eric that the heat and pressure of Venus might be affecting the ship's function. Eric regains the use of the ramjets and the pair manage to escape from Venus and back to Earth. On the trip back, Howie reveals his ruse to Eric. Eric insists that the cause was mechanical, and challenges Howie to a $5,000 bet that the problem will be found back on Earth. Howie accepts the bet. Back on Earth, the mechanics determine that, indeed, it was a mechanical problem due to the pressure of Venus's atmosphere. \\"Becalmed in Hell\\" was nominated for the 1965 Nebula Award for best short story. = \\"Death by Ecstasy\\" = First appearance: Galaxy Science Fiction, January 1969 (as \\"The Organleggers\\"). A Known Space story, first of \\"Gil the Arm\\" line. Asteroid miner Owen Jennison is found dead in an apartment on Earth, apparently of suicide: He was a wirehead, directly stimulating the pleasure center of the brain, and starved. Gil Hamilton, an operative of the United Nations Police (and friend of Owen’s) must solve what appears to be a classic locked room mystery: he does not believe that Owen was the type to turn wirehead or commit suicide, so the death must have been planned by somebody else. His investigations lead him to people associated with organlegging – the illicit handling and sale of spare body-parts. Eventually, Gil is captured by the organlegging gang, until, under threat of being harvested alive for his organs, his \\"third arm\\" - a psychologically limited form of psychokinesis – allows him to kill his captor in spite of being completely bound. The title, a play on the tradition of murder mysteries, is a reference to the story's investigators speculating about the experience of being electrocuted through the pleasure centre of the brain: \\"Death by Ecstasy\\" was adapted as a graphic novel by Bill Spangler, Terry Tidwell, and Steve Stiles in 1991. The story is part of the “Known Space” series, where the political and cultural differences between Earth humans and those of the asteroid belt are an important recurring theme. It is one of a group of Known Space stories in which Niven speculates on the effect on human culture of simple universal organ transplants: Additional story synopses (Gollancz hardback edition) The original 1973 Gollancz hardback edition () included five stories that were omitted in the Sphere paperback edition: = \\"Wait It Out\\" = First appearance: The Future Unbounded Program Book, 1968. = \\"Not Long Before the End\\" = First appearance: The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, April 1969.

It had one, two or five barrels, was fed from a vertical magazine or hopper and was operated by a crank. When the crank was turned, a feed arm positioned a cartridge in the breech, the bolt closed and the weapon fired. Turning the crank further opened the breechblock and extracted the spent case. Development The Gardner machine gun was invented in 1874 by William Gardner of Toledo, Ohio formerly a captain in the Union army during the American Civil War. After producing a prototype he went to the Pratt and Whitney company, who after a year of development produced a military version of the weapon. A demonstration to officers at the United States Navy yard in 1875 was successful, however they recommended that Pratt and Whitney continue with development of the system, incorporating improvements to the feed system, which were designed by E. G. Parkhurst, an engineer at Pratt and Whitney. The army attended the tests, but showed no interest in the weapon. Parkhurst added many improvements to the gun's firing mechanism which made it more reliable. During 1877 additional tests took place with a .45 calibre (11.4 mm) version of the weapon, which determined its muzzle velocity to be 1,280 feet per second (390 m/s). On 17 June 1879 a further demonstration was carried out at the Navy Yard, during which the weapon was presented by Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney. The weapon fired a total of 10,000 rounds during the test, taking a total elapsed time of 27 minutes 36 seconds, with breaks between firing to resolve an issue with one of the extractors. While the test was not without issues the weapon managed to fire 4,722 rounds before the first stoppage,An initial warm-up burst of 200, followed by 1,000 rounds, followed by 431 rounds, followed by 3,071 rounds. and after the stoppage was resolved it fired approximately 5,000 rounds without incident. On 15 January and 17 March 1880 duplicate tests were conducted at Sandy Hook proving ground in front of an Army review board. The weapon performed well, and they recommended that the Army buy a limited number for field evaluation, noting the low cost of the weapon. However the Army declined to purchase. At this point, the British Royal Navy, which had successfully deployed the Gatling gun, became interested in the weapon, and Gardner was invited to England to exhibit his invention. The Admiralty were so impressed by the demonstrations that they adopted the weapon and purchased the rights to produce it in England. Gardner remained in England to supervise the construction of the weapons. An 1887 Gardner machine gun The British Army then took an interest in machine guns and after a series of trials selected the Gardner gun. During these tests a five- barrelled Gardner gun fired 16,754 rounds before a failure occurred, with only 24 stoppages. When operator-induced errors were taken into account, there were only four malfunctions in 10,000 rounds fired. The Army adopted the weapon, although its introduction was delayed because of opposition from the Royal Artillery. It saw action in the Mahdist War (in Sudan), notably at the Battle of Abu Klea, where its mechanism proved vulnerable to desert sand and dust blowing about. There was also the .577/450 Martini–Henry calibre Bira gun, based upon the Gardner gun but with dual barrels, an overhead drum magazine, and designed in Nepal. It is noted that the Bira was only ever produced in very small numbers. These are extremely rare and a wonderful example of Victorian firepower. An American company, International Military Antiques, found a limited number of these exceptionally scarce weapons in the Old Palace of Lagan Silekhana in Kathmandu, Nepal which were included with the purchase of over 50,000 antique firearms from the Royal Nepalese Army in 2003. There is controversy, as the arms cache had to tranship through India and questions remain as to the purchase.

Biography  Pizzetti was born in Parma in 1880. He was part of the \\"Generation of 1880\\" along with Ottorino Respighi, Gian Francesco Malipiero, and Alfredo Casella. They were among the first Italian composers in some time whose primary contributions were not in opera. The instrumental and a cappella traditions had never died in Italian music and had produced, for instance, the string quartets of Antonio Scontrino (1850-1922) and the works of Respighi's teacher Giuseppe Martucci; but with the \\"Generation of 1880\\" these traditions became stronger. Ildebrando Pizzetti was the son of Odoardo Pizzetti, a pianist and piano teacher who was his son's first teacher. At first Pizzetti seemed headed for a career as a playwright—he had written several plays, two of which had been produced—before he decided in 1895 on a career in music and entered the Conservatorium of Parma. There he was taught from 1897 by Giovanni Tebaldini and gained the beginnings of his lifelong interest in the early music of Italy, reflected in his own music and his writings. Ildebrando Pizzetti He taught at the Conservatory in Florence (director from 1917 to 1923), directed the Milan Conservatory from 1923, and was Respighi's successor at the Academy of St. Cecilia in Rome from 1936 to 1958) His students included Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Olga Rudge, Manoah Leide-Tedesco and Franco Donatoni. Also a music critic, he wrote several books on the music of Italy and of Greece and co-founded a musical journal. Pizzetti was an active supporter of fascism and signed the Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals in 1925. A disciple of poet, playwright and revolutionary Gabriele d'Annunzio, Pizzetti wrote incidental music to his plays, and was highly influenced by d'Annunzio's dark neoclassic themes. One of Pizzetti's later operas is a setting of d'Annunzio's La Figlia Di Jorio. He was named to the Royal Academy of Italy in 1939. As noted by Sciannameo, his relations with the Fascist government of the 1940s were often positive, sometimes mixed; he received at one point high awards, and the one symphony of his mature years was the product of a commission from their Japanese allies to celebrate the \\"XXVI Centennial of the foundation of the Japanese Empire\\" (Benjamin Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem was also commissioned for this event, though it was rejected on account of its finale; its original finale was rediscovered after Britten's death and only premiered then.) Pizzetti's Symphony in A was premiered as noted in the article, and recorded in 1940, and again by Naxos with his Harp Concerto (Naxos 8573613, 2017).Sciannameo, pp. 46-7.

As the largest ethnic group in Angola, they make up almost 40 percent of the country's population. Overwhelmingly the Ovimbundu follow Christianity, mainly the Igreja Evangélica Congregacional de Angola (IECA), founded by American missionaries, and the Catholic Church. However, some still retain beliefs and practices from African traditional religions.  History  The origins of the Ovimbundu are Bantu populations who drifted in from the North, over the last millennium, and formed local/regional groups which slowly became political units and foci of social identity: M'Balundu, Sele, Wambo, Bieno and others. They developed a sophisticated agriculture, completed by the breeding of small animals (chicken, goats, swine) as well as of a modicum of cows bought from the farmer-herders to the South (Nyaneka-Nkhumbi, Ovambo). Incisive change came about when the Portuguese established a colonial bridgehead in Benguela, in the 16th century. Several of the small \\"kingdoms\\" saw their advantage in organising an intense caravan trade between Benguela and peoples of the East, in particular the Chokwe, the Luvale and the Mbunda,Terms of trade and terms of trust: the history and contexts of pre- colonial pages 403, 404 & 405...By Achim von Oppen, LIT Verlag Münster Publishers, 1993, from whom they obtained wax, rubber, honey and ivory. Each trading caravan had a professional leader and diviner. Trade agreements that had linked the independent chiefdoms led to the development of regional specializations, including metalwork and cornmeal production. Slavery and the slave trade were also an integral part of Ovimbundu societies. Caravan trading declined with the suppression of the slave trade and, more importantly, the construction of the Benguela Railway in 1904, and came to an end shortly after 1910. In the following years, the Ovimbundu completely changed their economy to cash crop production of corn, sold to a rapidly increasing network of Portuguese traders.See Hermann Pössinger, Interrelations between economic and social change in rural Africa: The case of the Ovimbundu of Angola, in: Franz- Wilhelm Heimer, Social Change in Angola, Munich: Weltforum Verlag, 1973, pp. 31-51 However, because of their demographic growth, and because significant portions of their lands were appropriated by Europeans for coffee, sisal and other plantations, many Ovimbundu started to work as paid labour, mainly on European plantations in their own region or in Northwest Angola, but also in Namibian mines. The Ovimbundu are the main social basis of UNITA, an anti- colonial movement that fought against the Portuguese from 1966 to 1974, was an adversary of the rival movement MPLA during the Angolan Civil War of 1975 to 2002, and is at present an opposition political party.The founder and historical leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, was an Ocimbundu of the Bieno group. During the Civil War the two major cities located in Umbundu territory, Huambo and Kuito, were to a large extent destroyed by the MPLA and UNITA respectively, as were a considerable number of villages and much infrastructure (roads, railways, bridges etc.). Many people died, and many others fled to cities either in their own area (Benguela, Lobito) or in distant areas (mainly Luanda and its surroundings, but also Lubango). During long periods parts of Umbundu territory were under UNITA control. Since 2002, considerable efforts at reconstruction have been made - by the government, interested in national reconciliation, but to a large extent by the people themselves, by the churches and by a variety of NGOs. A significant proportion of the \\"internally displaced\\" Ovimbundu have returned to their places of origin, where traditional forms of social organization have often survived or then been reconstituted. However, larger or smaller Ovimbundu communities have remained in many cities outside their habitat, so that a significant part of this people is now scattered all over Angola. In political terms, the Angolan parliamentary elections of 2008 reflected an important shift in Ovimbundu loyalty: while most of them had voted UNITA in the previous (1992) election, their majority now voted MPLA - because (after the death of Jonas Savimbi) UNITA had lost much of its credibility, but also because strengthening UNITA was seen as implying the risk of a renewal of armed violence.

Features Although they were written in several different cities and kingdoms, these early laws have a number of formulae in common. Most contain both an epilogue and a prologue, which usually explain the purpose of composing the laws, invoke divine authority, and command the reader to abide by them. They are always imposed or 'enacted' in the name of a ruler, be it a prince or king, and show no sign of being the result of legislative bodies. While many of these codes are only partially known, they nevertheless paint a fairly clear picture that enables us to learn what issues pertaining to rules were considered significant by the societies they governed in the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st millennia BC. Unlike modern codes, Cuneiform law provides no universal formula for general areas of law. Rather, laws typically consist of specific \\"if... then...\\" cases that are meant to act as an example or precedent. Punishments for crimes vary from code to code, but not all prescribe vengeance. Some call only for fines in certain instances, such as in the Code of Ur-Nammu, where one line reads: \\"If a man knocks out the eye of another man, he shall weigh out one-half a mina of silver.\\" These cases are sometimes arranged in a seemingly random order, though this may be the result of an inability to properly interpret them today as they would have been at the time they were in force.Cuneiform law - Britannica Online Encyclopedia Cuneiform law is generally classified separately from later Middle Eastern law, but has been viewed as a predecessor of Biblical and Jewish law. The communities of the Middle East that made use of cuneiform law were generally all in contact with one another, and developed similar cultures. Akkadian, a cuneiform language, was used throughout the entire area, and even as far as Egypt, for diplomatic communications during the Amarna Period.

It is generally a civil, not a criminal matter, meaning that one cannot go to jail for it, but in some jurisdictions there is potential for criminal prosecution. It is generally treated as a civil cause of action that arises in debtor/creditor relations, particularly with reference to insolvent debtors. The cause of action is typically brought by creditors or by bankruptcy trustees. Overview A transfer will be fraudulent if made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor. Thus, if a transfer is made with the specific intent to avoid satisfying a specific liability, then actual intent is present. However, when a debtor prefers to pay one creditor instead of another, that is not a fraudulent transfer. There are two types of fraudulent transfer—actual fraud and constructive fraud. Actual fraud typically involves a debtor who as part of an asset protection scheme donates his assets, usually to an \\"insider\\", and leaves himself nothing to pay his creditors. Constructive fraud does not relate to fraudulent intent, but rather to the underlying economics of the transaction, if it took place for less than reasonably equivalent value at a time when the debtor was in a distressed financial condition. It is important to note that the actual distinction between the two different types of fraud is what the intentions of the debtor were. For example, where the debtor has simply been more generous than they should have or, in business transactions, the business should have ceased trading earlier to preserve capital (see generally, wrongful trading). In a successful lawsuit, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the property transferred or its value from the transferee who has received a gift of the debtor's assets. Subsequent transferees may also be targeted, although they generally have stronger defenses than immediate transferees. Although fraudulent transfer law originally evolved in the context of a relatively simple agrarian economy, it is now widely used to challenge complex modern financial transactions such as leveraged buyouts. Fraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required \\"dueling\\" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results. Courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to make this analysis simpler, more consistent across cases, and more predictable.Amicus Brief, In re Lyondell Chemical Company bankruptcy =Badges of fraud= Evidence of actual intent is rarely available to a creditor for it would require proof of someone’s inner thoughts. Because of that, creditors often have to rely on circumstantial evidence of fraud. To prove actual intent, the courts have developed “badges of fraud,” which, while not conclusive, are considered by the courts as circumstantial evidence of fraud:https://www.kirkland.com/siteFiles/kirkexp/publications/2402/Document1/Friedland_Trustees_Power.pdf *Becoming insolvent because of the transfer; *Lack or inadequacy of consideration; *Family, or insider relationship among parties; *The retention of possession, benefits or use of property in question; *The existence of the threat of litigation; *The financial situation of the debtor at the time of transfer or after transfer; *The existence or a cumulative effect of a series of transactions after the onset of debtor’s financial difficulties; *The general chronology of events; *The secrecy of the transaction in question; and *Deviation from the usual method or course of business.  Individual jurisdictions =Australia= Under Australian law, if a transaction is entered into by a company which subsequently goes into liquidation, and the transaction was entered into by the company for the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors during the 10 years prior to the relation back day, the courts may set it aside. The relation-back day is defined as either the day upon which the application for the company's winding-up was filed, or the date of the commencement of liquidation. =Canada= Canadian provinces have jurisdiction over property and civil rights, which includes conveyances of property. Many provinces have statutes prohibiting fraudulent conveyances. They also prohibit the granting of fraudulent preferences, which purport to give certain creditors priority over other creditors in bankruptcy.. However, bona fide purchasers for value without notice are generally not liable for the actions of the fraudulent conveyer. =United Kingdom= *Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 *Insolvency Act 1986 section 423 = United States = In Anglo-American law, the doctrine of Fraudulent Conveyance traces its origins back to Twyne's Case,(1601) 3 Coke 80; 76 E.R. 809 in which an English farmer attempted to defraud his creditors by selling his sheep to a man named Twyne, while remaining in possession of the sheep, marking and shearing them. Fraud Upon Third Persons, Part 4, Sec 659. In the United States, fraudulent conveyances or transfersThe term fraudulent conveyance is included within the more general term fraudulent transfer, as a conveyance is more descriptive of the transfer of title to real property. Fraudulent transfer, however, includes all types of property and in the U.S., both are generally all governed by the same law. Therefore, the transfer will be used for the remainder of this section. are governed by two sets of laws that are generally consistent. The first is the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer ActPromulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1984 (\\"UFTA\\") that has been adopted by all but a handful of the states.As of June, 2005, 43 states and the District of Columbia had adopted it. See NCCUSL website, NCCUSL.org A complete copy can be found there or at South Texas College of Law, STCL.edu The second is found in the federal Bankruptcy Code.11 USC § 548. Much of the language of this section was adopted from the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which is the predecessor of the UFTA. The UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the \\"actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud\\" any creditor of the debtor. There are two kinds of fraudulent transfer. The archetypal example is the intentional fraudulent transfer. This is a transfer of property made by a debtor with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay his or her creditors.11 USC § 548(1); UFTA § 4(a)(1). The second is a constructive fraudulent transfer. Generally, this occurs when a debtor transfers property without receiving \\"reasonably equivalent value\\" in exchange for the transfer if the debtor is insolventUnder the Bankruptcy Code, insolvency exists when the sum of the debtor's debts exceeds the fair value of the debtor's property, with some exceptions. It is a balance sheet test. 11 USC § 101(32) at the time of the transfer or becomes insolvent or is left with unreasonably small capital to continue in business as a result of the transfer.11 USC § 548(2); UFTA § 4(a)(2). Unlike the intentional fraudulent transfer, no intention to defraud is necessary. The Bankruptcy Code authorizes a bankruptcy trustee to recover the property transferred fraudulentlyThis is done through the mechanism of avoidance of the transfer. 11 USC § 548. for the benefit of all of the creditors of the debtor11 USC § 551 if the transfer took place within the relevant time frame.Within two years prior to the filing of bankruptcy - 11 USC § 548(a) The transfer may also be recovered by a bankruptcy trustee under the UFTA too, if the state in which the transfer took place has adopted it and the transfer took place within its relevant time period.11 USC § 544(b) allows trustees to employ applicable state law to recover fraudulent transfers. The time period under the UFTA is in most cases four years before action is brought to recover. - UFTA § 9. Creditors may also pursue remedies under the UFTA without the necessity of a bankruptcy.UFTA § 7. Because this second type of transfer does not necessarily involve any actual wrongdoing, it is a common trap into which honest, but unwary debtors fall when filing a bankruptcy petition without an attorney. Particularly devastating and not uncommon is the situation in which an adult child takes title to the parents' home as a self-help probate measure (in order to avoid any confusion about who owns the home when the parents die and to avoid losing the home to a perceived threat from the state). Later, when the parents file a bankruptcy petition without recognizing the problem, they are unable to exempt the home from administration by the trustee. Unless they are able to pay the trustee an amount equal to the greater of the equity in the home or the sum of their debts (either directly to the Chapter 7 trustee or in payments to a Chapter 13 trustee), the trustee will sell their home to pay the creditors. In many cases, the parents would have been able to exempt the home and carry it safely through a bankruptcy if they had retained title or had recovered title before filing. Even good faith purchasers of property who are the recipients of fraudulent transfers are only partially protected by the law in the U.S. Under the Bankruptcy Code, they get to keep the transfer to the extent of the value they gave for it, which means that they may lose much of the benefit of their bargain, even though they have no knowledge that the transfer to them is fraudulent.See, Gill v. Maddalena, 176 B.R. 551, 555, 558 (Bankr.C.D.Cal. 1994) (citing 11 USC § 548(c)) Often fraudulent transfers occur in connection with leveraged buyouts (LBOs), where the management/owners of a failing corporation will cause the corporation to borrow on its assets and use the loan proceeds to purchase the management/owner's stock at highly inflated prices. The creditors of the corporation will then often have little or no unencumbered assets left upon which to collect their debts. LBOs can be either intentional or constructive fraudulent transfers, or both, depending on how obviously the corporation is financially impaired when the transaction is completed. Although not all LBOs are fraudulent transfers, a red flag is raised when, after an LBO, the company then cannot pay its creditors.See, for example, Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank, 126 B.R. 370, 393, 413 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991), in which an LBO left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days. Fraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required \\"dueling\\" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results. U.S. courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to streamline the analysis of constructive fraud, and judges are increasingly focusing on these market based measures. =Switzerland= Under Swiss law, creditors who hold a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against third parties that have benefited from unfair preferences or fraudulent transfers by the debtor prior to a seizure of assets or a bankruptcy. =South Korea= Fraudulent conveyance or also known as action revocatoire or Pauline action (채권자취소권) is a right to preserve the debtor's property for all creditors by canceling an action by the debtor which reduces the debtor's property with a knowledge that the action harms the rights of the creditor. To exercise this right, the creditor must have a right against the debtor that is monetary and not unique and personal in nature. For instance, the right to demand to clear of the land of the building or the right to delivery the land involves land and unique and therefore not subject to Pauline action (Supreme Court of South Korea, February 10, 1995, 94da2534).

In October 2007, 28,280 home day care providers voted to join the union. It is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers, the AFL-CIO and the Central Labor Council. It is also the largest member of New York State United Teachers, which is affiliated with the National Educational Association and Education International.  History  Two previous unions of New York schoolteachers, the Teachers Union, founded in 1916, and the Teachers Guild, founded in 1935, failed to gather widespread enrollment or support. Many of the early leaders were pacifists or socialists and so frequently met with clashes against more right-leaning newspapers and organizations of the time, as red-baiting was fairly common. The ethnically and ideologically diverse teachers associations of the city made the creation of a single organized body difficult, with each association continuing to vie for its own priorities irrespective of the others.A different kind of teachers union. Review by Peter Lamphere and Gina Sartori. International Socialist Review. Issue #80. November 2011. Review of: Reds at the Blackboard: Communism, Civil Rights, and the New York City Teachers Union By Clarence Taylor. Columbia University Press, 2011. The UFT was founded in 1960, largely in response to perceived unfairness in the educational system's treatment of teachers. Pensions were awarded to retired teachers only if over 65 or with 35 years of service. Female teachers faced two years of mandatory unpaid maternity leave after they gave birth. Principals could discipline or fire teachers with almost no oversight. The schools, experiencing a massive influx of baby boomer students, often were on double or triple session. Despite being college-educated professionals, often holding advanced master's degrees, teachers drew a salary of $66 per week, in 2005 dollars, the equivalent of $21,000 a year. The UFT was created on March 16, 1960 and grew rapidly. On November 7, 1960, the union organized a major strike. The strike largely failed in its main objectives but obtained some concessions, as well as bringing much popular attention to the union. After much further negotiation, the UFT was chosen as the collective bargaining organization for all City teachers in December 1961. Albert Shanker, a controversial but successful organizer was president of the UFT from 1964 until 1984. He held an overlapping tenure as president of the national American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to his death in 1997. In 1968, the UFT went on strike and shut down the school system in May and then again from September to November to protest the decentralization plan that was being put in place to give more neighborhoods community control. The Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike focused on the Ocean Hill-Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn but, ironically, the schools in that area were among the few that were open in the entire city. The Ocean Hill-Brownsville crisis is often described as a turning point in the history of unionism and of civil rights, as it created a rift between African- Americans and the Jewish communities, two groups that were previously viewed as allied. The two sides threw accusations of racism and anti-Semitism at each other. Following the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, some 14,000 teachers were laid off and class size soared. Another strike addressed some of these complaints and gave long-serving teachers longevity benefits. = Caucuses = The Unity Caucus, formed in 1962, predominates in the union, holding nearly every leadership position. New Action formed in the 1980s as an opposition caucus but, since 2003, it has cross-endorsed Unity candidates.Anna Philips, \\"Teachers union election: a look at caucuses and candidates,\\" Gotham Schools, April 5, 2010 The Movement of Rank and File Educators (MORE) is a new caucus, formed in 2012.James Cersonsky, \\"Dissident Caucus Aims to Give NYC Teachers Union M.O.R.E.\\" In These Times, July 17, 2012 In the spring 2013 UFT election campaign, president Michael Mulgrew (Unity) refused repeated requests to debate his opponent, Julie Cavanagh (MORE).Yoav Gonen and Carl Campanile, \\"Foe: UFT Boss is Chicken,\\" New York Post, March 28, 2013  Composition  According to UFT's Department of Labor records since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, about 32% of the union's membership are considered retirees, with eligibility to vote in the union. UFT contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which, since 2005, have numbered comparatively about 1% of the size of the union's membership. As of 2013 this accounts for 59,444 retirees and 2,675 non-members paying agency fees, compared to 124,145 \\"active\\" members.  Current issues  The previous president of the UFT, Randi Weingarten, resigned in 2009 to lead the AFT. She has clashed repeatedly with the mayors of the city; in particular with former mayor Rudy Giuliani and mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg made student promotion to third, sixth and eighth grade contingent upon performance on standardized tests, which the UFT and the New York Board of Regents have criticized as being flawed. The UFT opposes merit pay for teachers, opting for seniority-based pay, but joined in November 2007, with Mayor Bloomberg in agreeing to a voluntary incentive program for high-achieving schools with high-needs populations. The union does not support a proposed reform of the seniority-based LIFO (education) law. In July 2007,Weingarten collaborated with Mayor Bloomberg in supporting a modified merit pay program with bonuses to schools and additional bonuses targeted for specific teachers.Elissa Gootman, \\"Teachers Agree to Bonus Pay Tied to Scores,\\" The New York Times, October 18, 2007 The UFT strongly supports the reduction of class sizes for all subjects and grade levels in New York City public schools. The UFT, under the leadership of presidents Weingarten and Mulgrew, has collaborated with tenets of the education reform movement, such as support for value-added modeling for teacher evaluation.Maura Walz, \\"Klein, Mulgrew to help pitch New York’s Race to the Top plan,\\" Gotham Schools, July 28, 2010  Lawsuit against school co-location  In May 2011, the UFT, along with the NAACP and others, filed a lawsuit against the New York City Department of Education to stop school closings and the co-location of schools. In the lawsuit, the union charged that the Department of Education was improperly closing schools. The lawsuit also asked the court to stop school co-locations. Before a court hearing on the suit in June 2011, parent groups held a news conference to thank the NAACP for fighting on behalf of all kids and to press for fairness and equity. The New York City Parents Union filed its own lawsuit in June 2011 to stop co-locations and school closings, stating, “Despite inconsistent and uncertain results, the DOE continues to push public school parents into a privately managed school system where many charters perform worse than the public schools while failing to serve their fair share of students with special needs and English Language Learners.”  Preventing layoffs  On Friday June 24, 2011, UFT President Michael Mulgrew, along with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, announced that an agreement had been reached to prevent the layoff of 4,100 New York City teachers. The agreement came six months after Mayor Bloomberg had warned 21,000 layoffs were possible. The union had opposed all layoffs with a strategy of leafleting, marches and rallies, including a march on Wall Street on May 12, 2011, with 20,000 participants.

Nahalat Ahim, Jerusalem. The sofer was from the Sharabi family According to most views of Jewish Law, a Torah scroll (Sefer Torah) should be written on gevil parchment, as was done by Moses for the original Torah scroll he transcribed.Talmud, Bava Batra 14b and Gittin 54b Further, a reading of the earliest extant manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah indicate that gevil was halakha derived from Moses and thus required for Torah scrolls.Mishnah Torah - Hilkoth Tefillin 1:8 Maimonides wrote that it is a law given to Moses at Sinai that a Torah scroll must be written on either gevil or klaf in order to be valid, and that it is preferable that they be written on gevil.Mishneh Torah, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:14 Etymology Related to גויל, gewil, a rolling (i.e. unhewn) stone, cf. :he:wiktionary:גול, \\"to roll.\\" (Jastrow) Definition of gevil Gevil is a form skin for safrut (halakhic writing) that is made of tanned, whole hide. The precise requirements for processing gevil are laid down by the Talmud, Geonim and Rishonim. :Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: There are three [untanned] hide [stages before it is tanned into gevil]: Matza, ḥifa, and diftera. :א\\"ר חייא בר אסי משמיה דעולא ג' עורות הן מצה חיפה ודיפתרא -- Gittin 22a; Shabbat 79a According to law, the preparation of gevil must include salt, flour and mey afatzim (wasp residue/gall-nut water). (Shabbat. 79b) These requirements were reconfirmed as a Law given to Moses at Sinai by Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah. Gall nuts—rich in tannic acid—are a tree's reaction to an invasive parasitic wasp's egg; the pure black tint of the ink used on Torahs results from the reaction between the tannic acid and iron sulfate (a powder used to make the ink).Shabboth 79a There are three forms of tanned skin known to Jewish law. The other two forms (qelaf and dukhsustus) result from splitting the hide into two layers; however, there is some dispute as to their identification. Others deviate from the traditional process and use modern chemical processes instead. However, some believe that this invalidates the parchment for scribal use. According to the Halakhot Gedolot, klaf is the inner layer, adjacent to the flesh, while dukhsustos is the outer layer, on which the hair grows: :תניא הלכה למשה מסיני תפילין על הקלף ומזוזה על דוכסוסטוס וקלף במקום בשר ודוכסוסטוס במקום שער. :A baraita states: It is a Law given to Moses at Sinai that tefilin are written on qelaf and mezuzah on dukhsustus. Qelaf, on the flesh side; dukhsustus, on the hair side. -- (Hilkhot Tefilin, perek 25 daf 100 in Venice 1548 printing) The same view is expressed in the oldest extant manuscripts and critical editions of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah and the Babylonian Talmud (Shab. 79b). This is also the same definition which appears in the minor Talmudic tractate called Sofrim. However, more recent authorities reverse the two descriptions, and many printed editions of the Mishneh Torah are \\"adjusted\\" to reflect this. The reason for this original adjustment away from the original definition is a mystery. Some suspect that copying errors are to blame. As a result, many have become confused, in terms of which part of the skin should be used for writing. Using the full hide known as gevil for Sifrei Torah does avoid this issue, but unfortunately this solution won't work for tefilin which must be written on Klaf and are not kosher if written on gevil. Uses of gevil According to the Talmud, Moses used gevil for the Torah scroll he placed into the Holy Ark of the Covenant.Bava Batra 14b; Gittin 54b Elsewhere in the Talmud, there is testimony that Torah scrolls were written on gevil.Gittin 54b Today, a handful of Jewish scribes and artisans continue to make scroll material in this way. However, the majority of Torah scrolls are written on klaf, in their belief that the Talmud recommends (as opposed to requires) gevil and relates to the optimal beautification of the scrolls rather than an essential halachic requirement. Given the uncertainty about which layer of the hide is in fact the klaf, there is a growing movement for insisting on a return to gevil in Torah scrolls - in order to avoid all doubts. Clearly, the antiquity of gevil (as the original practice) is not being debated by anyone. Most of the Dead Sea Scrolls (200 BCE), found in and around the caves of Qumran near the Dead Sea, are written on gevil. Properly, klaf should be used for tefillin and duchsustus for mezuzot. Once more, this rule is often relaxed in practice but there is a minority which seeks to return to the actual law.

Alamo Drafthouse Cinema. Retrieved October 8, 2016. and starring Emilio Estevez, Lance Henriksen, Cristina Raines, Veronica Cartwright, and Richard Masur. The film is made up of four short films based on urban legends; the first concerns a woman who encounters a killer in the back seat of her car; the second concerns a video game-addicted teenager who is consumed by his game; the third focuses on a fallen priest who is stalked by a pickup truck from hell; and the last follows a suburban family battling a giant rat in their home. Nightmares was originally filmed as a two hour pilot of a proposed television series to be broadcast by the NBC network during the 1983-1984 TV season. Plot=Terror in Topanga= During a traffic stop at night, a cop is stabbed to death by someone leaping from the bushes. A killer is terrorizing a local California area and the TV and radio are reporting that the cop is his fifth victim. After Lisa (Raines) puts her children to bed, she discovers that she is out of cigarettes. Her husband (Joe Lambie) forbids her to go to the store, but she sneaks out anyway and heads down the canyon. Lisa gets the cigarettes and begins home only to realize that she is almost out of gas. All the gas stations appear to be closed. Finally, she stops at an out of the way station and out comes an attendant (William Sanderson), who just happens to perfectly match the killer's description on the radio. She gets increasingly alarmed as the attendant, who seems to be studying her car and its occupant, suddenly lunges at the car with the gas nozzle. He drags her out of the car, draws a pistol and fires – to protect her from the real murderer (Lee Ving), who was hiding in her back seat. =The Bishop of Battle= Young Jerry \\"J.J.\\" Cooney (Estevez) is a video game wizard and arcade game hustler with help from his bespectacled friend Zock (Billy Jayne). After an argument about Jerry's obsession with video games, they split up for the day, and Jerry goes into his local arcade to try again to beat The Bishop of Battle, a maddeningly difficult video game that features thirteen levels; no one he knows has made it to the thirteenth, and many believe it is just a myth. He repeatedly tries and fails to make it to the thirteenth level until the owner forces him to leave at closing time. Jerry's parents, concerned about his performance in school, ground him until his grades improve. That night, he sneaks out and breaks into the arcade to finally finish the game. However, when he reaches the thirteenth level, the arcade cabinet collapses and the enemies fly out, and he defends himself with the suddenly-functioning gun from the game's controls (Estevez went through a two-week gun training session with the NYPD to realistically perform his gun maneuvers for these scenes). Jerry flees to the parking lot, but the Bishop of Battle appears, drawing closer and closer to a terrified Jerry. The next morning, his friends and family find a reconstructed Bishop of Battle machine amid the ruins of the arcade. Jerry's image appears on the screen for a few seconds before it turns into another of the game's sprites. =The Benediction= Lance Henriksen plays a priest serving at a small parish and is facing a crisis of faith brought on by the violent death of a young boy. He explains to his bishop (Robin Gammell) that he has lost his belief in the concepts of good and evil. He leaves the rectory with some holy water that he considers merely tap water, and takes off across the desert in his car. He encounters a black Chevrolet C-20 Fleetside that appears as if from nowhere. At first it drives threateningly then disappears, but with subsequent appearances it forces him off the road and strikes his car. The truck's driver is an unseen Satan through the truck's tinted windows, but an inverted cross can be seen hanging from the rear-view mirror. Satan's truck finally destroys the ex-priest's car in a collision that does no damage to the truck. With nowhere left to run, the former priest hurls the holy water at the truck, which is vaporized. The episode ends as the police arrive on the scene and an ambulance crew takes the injured priest back to the church. =Night of the Rat= In her home, housewife Claire (Cartwright) has been dealing with a recent rat problem as she can hear the rats in the walls and attic, but her husband Steven (Masur) ignores it. Even though Steven assures Claire that he will take care of the problem with a couple of rat traps in the attic, the disturbances progressively get worse, as objects start falling off shelves and the family cat is eaten from being torn to shreds. Soon enough, Claire calls an exterminator (Albert Hague) who discovers that the creature has gnawed huge holes behind various cabinets and has also chewed on the power cables. Steven comes home, criticizes his wife, and tells the exterminator to leave. Claire keeps consulting the exterminator and inevitably she and her family are forced into a showdown with a giant rat.

However, on the audio commentary on the 2015 Blu-ray release, executive producer Andrew Mirisch clarifies that the film actually began life as a pilot for an unnamed anthology series for NBC before becoming a theatrical feature for Universal Pictures. Reception Though the poster and trailer boasted that the film would be a sleeper and ' one you won't forget ',http://www.impawards.com/1983/nightmares.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOncLexWDE the film was not well received on release. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 29% based on reviews from 7 critics. In her review for the New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"Nothing spoils a horror story faster than a stupid victim. And Nightmares, an anthology of four supposedly scary episodes, has plenty of those.\\" Home video The film was released on VHS by Universal Pictures in the 1980s. It was later released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1999 in \\"Full Frame (1.33:1) Presentation\\" and has since gone out of print; this DVD issue of the film became extremely rare, with secondhand prices netting over one-hundred dollars. On July 10, 2015, Scream Factory announced on their Facebook page that Nightmares was part of their roster of upcoming Blu-ray releases. On December 22, 2015, Scream Factory released Nightmares on Blu-ray.

History and profile The newspaper was founded with the name of Helsingborgs Tidning on 1 October 1867. It began to use its current name, Helsingborgs Dagblad, in 1884. During its initial period it was a moderate publication. The paper has its headquarters in Helsingborg. In January 2001, the newspaper merged with Nordvästra Skånes Tidningar and is today published in three different local editions with separate names. In 2006, the paper changed its format from traditional broadsheet to tabloid following a general trend among daily newspapers. In 2000 Helsingborgs Dagblad was, as the first Swedish newspaper ever, named The World’s Best-Designed Newspaper by the international organization Society of News Design. In 2012 it was named as Sweden's best newspaper. On 23 April 2014, Sydsvenskan acknowledged that they wanted to buy HD. A strong reason was reported to be that both newspapers had seen their ad revenue decrease heavily. They reached a deal in the end of May and the Swedish Competition Authority approved it around two weeks after. While Sydsvenskan has a soft paywall, it is not yet decided if HD will also have one.

She is president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and a member of the AFL–CIO. She is the former president of the United Federation of Teachers. Randi Weingarten (far right) with former Senator Al Franken Early life Rhonda \\"Randi\\" Weingarten was born in 1957 in New York City, to a Jewish family, Gabriel and Edith (Appelbaum) Weingarten. Her father was an electrical engineer and her mother a teacher.Wadler, Joyce \\"Hoping to Continue Education as Union Head\\", The New York Times, January 20, 1998. Weingarten grew up in Rockland County, New York, and attended Clarkstown High School North in New City, New York. A congregant of Beth Simchat Torah synagogue, she considers herself a deeply religious Jew.Nathan-Kazis, Josh, \\"The Leading Jew in Labor Wears Pearls\\" The Forward, May 12, 2010.Chan, Sewell, \\"Teachers' Union Chief Discusses Gay Identity\\", The New York Times, October 12, 2007. Weingarten's interest in trade unions and political advocacy was formed during childhood. Her mother's union went on a seven-week strike when Weingarten was in the eleventh grade. Under New York state's Taylor Law, her mother could have been fired for taking part in a strike. Instead, she was fined two days' pay for every day she was on strike. Later that year, the school board cut $2 million from the budget. Weingarten and several other students convinced the school board to let them conduct a survey regarding the impact of the cuts. The survey led several school board members to change their minds, and rescind the cuts. From 1979 to 1980, Weingarten was a legislative assistant for the Labor Committee of the New York State Senate. She received a B.S. degree in labor relations from the ILR School at Cornell University in 1980 and a J.D. degree from the Yeshiva University Cardozo School of Law in 1983. Legal career Weingarten worked as a lawyer for the firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan from 1983 to 1986, where she handled several acrimonious arbitration cases on behalf of the UFT. She was appointed an adjunct instructor at the Cardozo School of Law in 1986. She also worked as an attorney in the real estate department of Wien Malkin and Bettex. In 1986, Weingarten became counsel to Sandra Feldman, then-president of the UFT. Weingarten handled high-level grievances for the union. She was also lead counsel for the union in a number of lawsuits against New York City and the state of New York over school funding and school safety.\\"Teachers Union Leader Is Elected to Full Term\\", The New York Times, April 7, 1999. By the early 1990s, she was the union's primary negotiator in UFT contract negotiations. Her negotiating positions became more aggressive throughout the 1990s.Traster, Tina \\"Crain's 100 Most Influential Women in NYC Business - The Power 25: Teachers' Favorite: Randi Weingarten, United Federation of Teachers\\", Crain's New York Business, September 30, 2007.Greenhouse, Steven \\"Union Scandal Could Produce A Tougher Negotiating Stance\\", The New York Times, December 20, 1998; Greenhouse, Steven \\"After Scandals, New Union Leaders Turn More Aggressive\\", March 22, 1999. Teaching career From 1991 to 1997 she taught at Clara Barton High School in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The classes she taught included Law, Ethical Issues in Medicine, AP Political Science, and US History and Government. Her political science students competed in the We the People civics competition, winning the state championship in 1993-94 and 1994–95 and being fourth in the national championship in 1994-95. In 1995, Weingarten was elected Assistant Secretary of the UFT. She continued teaching per diem from 1995 to 1997. UFT career Elected the UFT's treasurer in 1997, Weingarten succeeded Sandra Feldman as president of the union a year later when Feldman was elected president of the national American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten was elected a Vice President of the AFT the same year.Hartocollis, Anemone \\"Union Leader For Teachers Is Leaving Post\\", The New York Times, January 8, 1998.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Teachers' Union President Re-Elected\\", The New York Times, April 2, 2004.Greenhouse, Steven \\"Teachers' Union Chief Re-Elected\\", The New York Times, April 2, 2007. Weingarten was reelected by consistently wide margins after her initial appointment in 1998. The local union's constitution required her to run for the UFT presidency within a year of her appointment. She received 74 percent of the vote against two opponents in 1999, and served the final two years of Feldman's term. She ran in 2001 for a full term and was re- elected. She won her third full three-year term with more than 88 percent of the vote, despite having two opposing candidates. On March 30, 2007, Weingarten won reelection to a fourth term as UFT President, garnering 87 percent of the vote. Weingarten stepped down from her post as president of the United Federation of Teachers on July 31, 2009.

The UFT's contract expired on May 31, 2003. Once again, negotiations proved contentious. In January 2004, New York City School Chancellor Joel Klein proposed a merit- pay deal; in February, Mayor Bloomberg proposed replacing the union's 200-page contract with an 8-page set of guidelines. Weingarten rejected these proposals, and asked for state mediation in late March 2004.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Teachers' Union Accuses City of Avoiding Talks on Contract\\", The New York Times, December 2, 2003; Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Chancellor Urges Changes in Teachers' Pay\\", The New York Times, January 28, 2004; Herszenhorn, \\"Mayor's Goal Is 'Thin' Pact With Teachers\\", The New York Times, February 6, 2004; Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Teachers' Union Warns of an Impasse in Talks With the City\\", The New York Times, February 7, 2004. In May, Weingarten agreed to discuss merit pay.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"A Proposal for Incentive Pay at City's Low-Performing Schools\\", The New York Times, May 9, 2004 The union began a public-relations campaign featuring subway and television ads demanding a contract and held protests and marches. On June 1, 2005, nearly 20,000 teachers—about a quarter of the UFT membership—packed Madison Square Garden for a rally at which Weingarten denounced Bloomberg and Klein, asked for a strike vote, and requested state arbitration.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"In Subway Ads, Teachers Renew Push for Contract\\", The New York Times, April 18, 2005; Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Teachers Pack the Garden to Demand a City Contract\\", The New York Times, June 2, 2005 Contract talks resumed in August and September.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Mayor Moves Closer to Deal On Teachers\\", The New York Times, September 27, 2005. A tentative contract was reached on October 3, 2005. The union won a wage increase of 14.25 percent over 52 months, retroactive to June 1, 2003. Other changes include a slightly longer workday (with the extra time devoted to tutoring) and the elimination of union control over some staffing decisions. The contract, ratified on November 3, 2005, passed with just 63 percent of UFT members in favor.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"City Reaches Tentative Deal With Teachers\\", The New York Times, October 4, 2005; Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Teachers Approve Contract Deal\\", The New York Times, November 4, 2005. Weingarten concluded her third collective bargaining agreement on November 6, 2006, when the union and city reached a tentative deal to increase pay by 7.1 percent over two years. The agreement raised base pay for senior teachers above $100,000 a year, bringing city salaries in line with those in New York City's suburbs for the first time. The city did not seek any increases in the work day or work load or any other concessions, as it had with other unions. Negotiations over health benefits were to be conducted separately in talks with the Municipal Labor Committee, an umbrella group for municipal unions which Weingarten chairs. Observers said Bloomberg sought an early contract in order to win UFT support in his struggle with Governor Eliot Spitzer over school funding. In October 2007, Weingarten assented to two agreements whereby the city and the UFT would jointly seek legislative approval for a new pension deal allowing teachers with 25 years of service to retire at age 55 and providing bonuses to all teachers in schools that showed a certain level of improvement in student achievement. In June 2009, Weingarten negotiated some pension modifications for new teachers in exchange for maintaining the age 55 pension and for allowing teachers to return to their traditional post-Labor Day start date. =New union headquarters= In 2003, Weingarten sold the UFT's headquarters at 260 Park Avenue South and two other buildings at 48 and 49 East 21st Street for $63.6 million and moved the union's offices to Lower Manhattan, purchasing a building at 50 Broadway for $53.75 million and leasing the building next to it, 52 Broadway, for 32 years. The UFT also financed a $40 million renovation of both buildings. =Organizing= The UFT represents all teachers, paraprofessional school employees, and professionals (such as school nurses, school psychologists, and others) in the New York City schools. The UFT saw some membership growth under Weingarten among these workers.Hu, \\"Mayor Vetoes School Nurse Bill\\", The New York Times, November 15, 2004; \\"More Schools to Have Full-Time Nurses\\", The New York Times, September 18, 2004. The UFT also has a registered nurse division which represents roughly 2,800 registered nurses at Lutheran Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital-South, Jewish Home and Hospital Home Health Agency, and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York.\\"Visiting Nurses Vie for Funds\\", New York Teacher, January 28, 2004; Fallaci, \\"They've Come A Long Way\\", New York Teacher, January 20, 2005; Hirsch, \\"UFT Nurses OK VNS Contract\\", New York Teacher\\", February 17, 2005. The UFT saw more growth in this division, as the Visiting Nurse Service expanded and the union organized non-RN units at the non-profit company. Weingarten's largest organizing victory came when the UFT organized child care providers in New York City. The campaign began in 2005, and concluded in 2007. The organizing drive—the largest successful union campaign in the city since 1960, when the United Federation of Teachers itself was formed—added 28,000 workers to the union's 113,000 active and 56,000 retired members.Greenhouse, Steven \\"Care Providers Need a Union, 3 Groups Say\\", The New York Times, July 15, 2005; Greenhouse, Steven \\"Child Care Workers in New York City Vote to Unionize\\", The New York Times, October 24, 2007. AFT Presidency On February 12, 2008, AFT President Edward J. McElroy announced he would retire at the union's regularly scheduled biennial convention in July. On July 14, Weingarten was elected to succeed him. She is the first openly gay individual to be elected president of a national American labor union. In her first year, she fought for resources to keep schools and other public institutions afloat during the ongoing fiscal crises, and started an AFT Innovation Fund to promote and disseminate innovative educational reforms by teachers and their union. =Views=School reform Weingarten advocates what she describes as a \\"bottom up\\" approach to education reform, and says that public officials should welcome the views—and account for the needs—of teachers when working to help schools better serve their students. She has, as AFT president, criticized state and federal reforms proposed by her opponents. The AFT, during Weingarten's presidency, has focused scrutiny on well-funded third parties that have attempted to influence education policy—with the Walton Foundation, the largest philanthropic donor in the United States, drawing particular scrutiny. In a 2015 report co-authored with In the Public Interest, the AFT decried the Walton Foundation's pursuit of what the report termed a \\"market-based model [that] will lead to ... the eventual elimination of public education altogether, in favor of an across-the-board system of privately operated schools.\\" Weingarten was among nineteen arrested in March 2013 while protesting a Philadelphia School Reform Commission meeting on school closures. Neighborhood public schools, according to Weingarten, can coexist with charter schools—but she opposes initiatives that work to supplant the former with the latter. Weingarten sees the role of charters as complementary to, rather than competing with, other schools. \\"Charter schools should be laboratories for innovation and creative ideas that can be scaled up so they can enrich communities,\\" she has said. In a 2013 debate in New Haven, Weingarten argued that charter schools pull money from regular school districts. Standardized testing Weingarten condemns a \\"fixation on testing and data over everything else\\" as \\"a fundamental flaw in how our nation approaches public education,\\" but accepts the use of standardized tests as one tool among several to evaluate student achievement and teacher performance. As AFT president, she has criticized the No Child Left Behind Act for \\"allow[ing] high-stakes testing to eclipse all else, including the children themselves.\\" In a 2015 opinion essay for the New York Times, she wrote: > Tests should be used to get teachers, parents and school communities the > information they need to help students make progress — not to sanction or > scapegoat, as they do now with high-stakes tests driving federal education > policy. Instead, we need investments to level the playing field for kids, > boost innovation, elevate the teaching profession and support educators. The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (ESSA) passed into law with the AFT's support. The law eliminates the federal requirement that states evaluate teachers according to their students' standardized test scores, and allows states to weigh factors in addition to test scores when judging the performance of school systems. Weingarten has applauded the ESSA for \\"relegating the era of test-and-punish strategies to the trash heap\\" and for offering \\"teachers ... flexibility to try new ways to teach, to meet the needs of their students, and to help their students think critically and analytically instead of focusing on what might be on a high-stakes test.\\" As AFT president, Weingarten favored the act particularly because of provisions that stripped the United States Secretary of Education's role in influencing teacher-evaluation systems and maintained federal funding Title I for schools with high proportions of students from low-income households. Teacher training and retention An overemphasis on standardized testing and a shortage of resources, according to Weingarten, has harmed efforts to recruit and retain well-prepared teachers at public schools. \\"A haphazard approach to the complex and crucial enterprise of educating children,\\" she has written, \\"[is] unfair to both students and teachers, who want and need to be well- prepared to teach from their first day on the job.\\" In response to a New York Times story about public school systems short of teaching staff, she said that \\"teachers are used to the pressure cooker but are stressed out because they aren't getting the support, resources, time and respect they need to do their jobs.\\" Weingarten has proposed—as a means of improving the quality of teachers in American classrooms—the creation of a professional licensing exam, akin to the bar exam taken by lawyers, for new teachers. \\"Better preparing teachers for entry into the profession,\\" Weingarten says, \\"will dramatically reduce the loss of new teachers—nearly half of whom leave after fewer than five years—and the loss of knowledge that goes with it.\\" Poverty and community schools The AFT, under Weingarten's leadership, has worked to draw attention to economic inequalities within cities and regions that can hobble public schools. With school systems in the United States heavily reliant on local property taxes, systems that rely on depressed or depleted tax bases can find themselves without the financial resources available to comparatively wealthier districts. Philanthropic efforts in public schools, in Weingarten's view, have incorrectly focused on the educator's role in student performance—\\"what we now know is 10% of student achievement,\\" she remarked in one interview—to the exclusion of underlying problems, such as poverty, that undermine student progress. \\"We need to ... treat kids that have the least, give them the most,\\" says Weingarten—\\"not with a blank check, but actually figure out the supports they need so that they can climb up the ladder of opportunity.\\" During Weingarten's presidency, the AFT has pushed for creating what the union calls \\"community schools\\": schools that serve as hubs for non- academic programs addressed to whole communities. Undergirding that concept is the understanding—as described by former Boston Public Schools superintendent Thomas W. Payzant, who implemented a community-school model in the city, in a 2005 book—that \\"students' noneducational realities, such as nutritional deficiencies, medical problems, safety concerns, even daily hunger, are daunting barriers that can obstruct even the most flexible educational program.\\" To address those perceived needs, community schools offer 'wraparound services' that target identified social issues: job banks to help parents secure employment, for example, or housing counseling for families that lack permanent homes. In a 2008 address given during her first run for the AFT presidency, Weingarten said, in the course of promoting the community- school paradigm: > Imagine schools that are open all day and offer after-school and evening > recreational activities, child care and preschool, tutoring and homework > assistance. Schools that include dental, medical and counseling clinics ... > Imagine if schools had the educational resources children need to thrive, > like smaller classes and individualized instruction, plentiful, up-to-date > materials and technology anchored to that rich curriculum, decent > facilities, an early start for toddlers and a nurturing atmosphere. The AFT has extolled community schools that operate in Philadelphia, Cincinnati, St. Paul, Minn., Austin, Texas, Providence, R.I., and other cities where the union represents public schoolteachers. The union has itself sponsored community school efforts in Chicago, and in West Virginia, the AFT has launched a public-private partnership—called Reconnecting McDowell—that aims to \\"enhance educational opportunity for children in the McDowell County public schools in Central Appalachia, while addressing the underlying problems caused by severe and chronic poverty and economic decline.\\" Efforts through the program have included the building of a \\"teacher village\\" for educators, setup of an internship program for high-school students, and mentoring of students from families in which they would be the first to attend college. Teacher tenure Weingarten has resisted attempts to curtail or eliminate tenure protections for public-school teachers, arguing that the outright removal of tenure protection would hurt the quality of classroom instruction. \\"We know that the states with the highest academic performance have the strongest due process protections for teachers,\\" Weingarten wrote to Time magazine in 2014. \\"Research shows that our most at-risk kids need more- experienced teachers. But why would these teachers stay at schools with few tools, little support and no ability to voice their concerns?\\" Education policy proposals built around eliminating tenure have drawn derision from Weingarten as \\"faddish reforms\\" at the expense of what she terms \\"the most critical issues confronting American education\\": teacher training, education funding, school safety, and educational reinforcement at home. She downplays the idea of worker protections as obstacles to improving schools, describing tenure \\"not a job for life, [but] ensuring fairness and due process before someone can be fired, plain and simple.\\" When United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan issued a statement siding with a California superior court judge who ruled the state's teacher tenure protections unconstitutional, Weingarten responded that Duncan had \\"added to the polarization\\" in debates over education policy, and charged that focusing on \\"quick fixes, blame games or silver bullets\\" such as ending tenure had \\"set us back in our effort to help all kids succeed.\\" The AFT has worked, however, to reshape tenure in some states. In 2011 Weingarten offered a plan that would rely on a teacher- evaluation system with multiple parts—including assessment of student improvement on tests—to give tenured teachers rated unsatisfactory one year to improve, and allow the firing of teachers who fail to meet that deadline within the next 100 days. The proposal followed a 2008 agreement between Weingarten and District of Columbia public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee that allowed the termination of Washington Teachers' Union members evaluated as ineffective, after a one-year period—and in public remarks, Weingarten has discussed her role in efforts to modernize tenure elsewhere. Pensions and retirement Under Weingarten, the AFT has combatted efforts to shift responsibility for retirement investing to teachers—with Weingarten herself drawing notoriety, according to Institutional Investor magazine, as \\"the most public face in the battle for defined benefit pension funds.\\" In a 2014 op-ed, Weingarten attacked \\"people who press ... to convert defined benefit pensions to 401(k) plans,\\" asserting that advocates of 401(k) plans \\"never talk about the benefits retirees are likely to get under these new plans — because it's likely to be a lot less than retirees need to get by.\\" In its campaign against moving teachers into defined-contribution pensions, AFT has argued that shifting investment risks to individuals has led to deleterious results for retirees. Hedge funds that manage teacher pension investments have drawn heavy criticism from AFT; the union, in 2015, prepared a report that concluded such investments \\"exacted a high cost, had laggard returns and generally moved in tandem with the overall stock market.\\" The report came in the wake of a 2013 AFT study that charged some hedge-fund managers with a conflict of interest—according to BuzzFeed, the 2013 report said that while managing teachers' defined benefit pensions, some fund managers had \\"support[ed] groups like the Manhattan Institute, which has recommended replacing pensions with 401(k)-type plans, and Students First, whose national branch advocates eliminating defined-benefit plans.\\" Political activities Weingarten and the UFT endorsed George Pataki for re-election as Governor of New York in 2002.Lueck, Thomas J. \\"As Expected, New York City Teachers Union Endorses Pataki\\", The New York Times, October 10, 2002. Julia Levy reported in the New York Sun on February 1, 2005, that candidates for mayor of New York were meeting with Weingarten, and \\"political experts\\" were saying that \\"Weingarten has become something of a kingmaker.\\" The UFT's endorsement, wrote Levy, meant \\"votes, campaign volunteers, and information.\\" A lifelong Democrat, Weingarten is a member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). She was an early and critically important supporter of Howard Dean as Chairman of the DNC.Nagourney, Adam \\"Leaders Back Dean to Head Democrats Nationally\\", The New York Times, February 1, 2005. She is a superdelegate who was pledged to Hillary Clinton during the 2008 presidential primary.Gallagher, Jay \\"Some NY Super Delegates Still Undecided\\", Poughkeepsie Journal, February 21, 2008; Nagourney, Adam and Hossain, Farhana \\"Old Clinton Ties and Voters' Sway Tug at Delegates\\", The New York Times, February 17, 2008. In January 2009, she was mentioned as a possible candidate in the appointment process to replace Clinton's U.S. Senate seat. In one of the Wikileaks emails from John Podesta, chair of the Hillary Clinton campaign, Weingarten states her desire to \\"go after\\" the National Nurses United union after their endorsement of Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States. Criticism=Public school governance and oversight= In spring 1998 in the City Journal, the quarterly magazine of the conservative Manhattan Institute think tank, Sol Stern dismissed Weingarten's claim to support school reform as \\"pure union propaganda.\\" Carl Campanile reported in the January 21, 2004, New York Post that Weingarten had called for union members to voice concerns by sending e-mails to the schools chancellor, Joel Klein, and Mayor Bloomberg \\"about the micromanagement and mismanagement issues that make your job more difficult this year.\\" Pundit John Stossel wrote, in an opinion piece in the conservative New York Sun, about a rally held by Weingarten at Madison Square Garden at which teachers demanded \\"a new contract and more money.\\" Stossel said that the teachers unions \\"can pay for expensive rallies at 'the world's most famous arena' because every teacher in a unionized district like New York must give up some of his salary to the union. Even teachers who don't like the union, teachers who believe in school choice, and teachers who could make more on the open market must fork over their money to support the unions that fight against school choice and merit pay.\\" Calling the present situation in New York schools a nightmare, Stossel wrote that \\"the unions fight to protect the nightmare\\" and mocked Weingarten's promise that the UFT would \\"police our own profession\\" with \\"I'd like to police my own job, too. And I'll bet some students would just love to police their own homework!\\" He accused Weingarten of \\"protect[ing] incompetents\\" and \\"reward[ing] mediocrity.\\" He said that he had \\"confronted Weingarten,\\" telling her, \\"Unionized monopolies like yours fail. In this case, it is the children who - who you are failing.\\" She replied by rejecting the label \\"unionized monopoly\\" and by saying that her critics \\"don't really care about kids.\\" The editorial board of the New York Post wrote, on February 28, 2007, about a planned gathering of opponents of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's public-school reform efforts, describing some of the participants as \\"a bought-and-paid-for chorus of false reformers\\" who \\"dance to the tunes of Randi Weingarten ... who has been trying to derail real reform since Mayor Mike wrested control of the schools from the educrats some five years ago.\\" Calling the UFT \\"one of the richest special interests in America\\", the editorial board maintained that Weingarten does not care \\"about New York's schoolchildren\\" but is loyal \\"to her members.\\" In an opinion piece in the conservative New York Sun, Andrew Wolf wrote that Mayor Bloomberg had called the UFT the \\"number one\\" obstacle to education reform, but had reached a compromise with a coalition including the UFT, ACORN, and the Working Families Party. Wolf said that Weingarten, speaking to parent groups in a conference call, had called Department of Education officials \\"absolute and complete assholes\\" who \\"can't be trusted.\\" On September 30, 2009, in the conservative City Journal, Sol Stern asserted that \\"the UFT and the Bloomberg administration [had] increasingly developed a cartel-like working relationship, with New York taxpayers paying the price.\\" The editorial board of The New York Post said on June 2, 2009, that Weingarten, \\"who'd previously vowed to gut City Hall's control over the schools,\\" had now \\"delivered a nearly full-throated endorsement of it,\\" reflecting her recognition of the \\"sweeping, and undeniable\\" progress in test scores of elementary-school pupils, Reacting on July 7, 2009, to Weingarten's statement, upon taking control of the AFT, that New York City is \\"the best laboratory in the world for trying new things,\\" the conservative editorial board of The Wall Street Journal asserted this could be true \\"if it weren't for Ms. Weingarten's union,\\" and wrote that the UFT under her direction had done everything possible \\"to block significant reforms to New York's public schools.\\" In a 2009 essay by Steven Brill in The New Yorker, New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein was quoted as calling the teacher tenure policies defended by the UFT \\"ridiculous\\"—with Klein asserting that \\"the three principles that govern our system are lockstep compensation, seniority, and tenure. All three are not right for our children.\\" Brill attributed to \\"many education reformers\\" the belief \\"that the U.F.T. and its political allies had gained so much clout\\" over the years \\"that it had become impossible for the city's Board of Education, which already shared a lot of power with local boards, to maintain effective school oversight.\\" However, Brill later reversed his view of Weingarten, and proposed that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg appoint her chancellor of the school system.Nocera, Joe, Teaching With the Enemy, The New York Times, Nov. 7, 2011. =Raising salaries and merit pay= During her tenure as UFT president, Weingarten pushed for higher salaries and improved training for teachers, often agreeing to longer work days and more tutoring time in order to win better pay. Between 2002 and 2007, salaries for New York City teachers rose 42 percent.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"City in Tentative Deal With Teachers' Union\\", The New York Times, November 7, 2006.\\"The Influentials: Education\\", New York, May 8, 2006.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Teachers May Give Ground On Grievances\\", The New York Times, November 14, 2003; Aronson, Karen W. \\"Money Sought for Pilot Project To Improve Teacher Training\\", The New York Times, February 24, 2001. Weingarten has endorsed merit pay for city teachers, and in 2007 negotiated a controversial contract which paid teachers bonuses if their students' test scores rose.Dillon, Sam \\"Long Reviled, Merit Pay Gains Among Teachers\\", The New York Times, June 18, 2007; Gootman, Elissa \\"Teachers Agree To Bonus Pay Tied to Scores\\", The New York Times, October 18, 2007. Nicole Gelinas wrote in the conservative City Journal on June 16, 2005, that \\"Weingarten declared that merit-pay plans 'pit teachers against each other instead of encouraging a collaborative school culture.' What Weingarten and the union do not see ... is that competition is healthy.\\" Gelinas went on to assert that \\"until Weingarten budges ... virtue will have to be its own reward for New York's teachers.\\" In an opinion column on June 14, 1999, Bob McManus asserted that \\"67 percent of New York City's fourth-graders\\" had \\"turned up functionally illiterate in state tests in May,\\" and that the response from the UFT was to call for \\"more 'classroom resources' (i.e., Big League raises).\\" McManus argued that \\"there's more to this crisis than money—or the lack of it,\\" and called on Weingarten to \\"get out of the way of folks who believe they can get the job done for less.\\" Andrew Wolf, in an October 19, 2007, op-ed in the New York Sun entitled \\"Socialism for Schools,\\" argued that despite some observers' perception that \\"Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Klein [had] won a victory over the teachers' union by gaining approval of a merit pay scheme,\\" the real winner was Weingarten, who had gained power for the UFT. The new plan, Wolf asserted, did not reward individual performance but treated each school as a collective, with union committees dividing bonuses among all union members, including school secretaries and others. In October 2012, after what the New York Times called \\"months of intense and late-night negotiations,\\" Weingarten and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie reached a \\"landmark compromise,\\" agreeing on a new contract for teachers in the Newark school system. Although, as the Times noted, Weingarten \\"had criticized what she calls 'merit pay schemes,'\\" she \\"agreed to embrace the concept in exchange for a promise that teachers would have a rare role in evaluating performance.\\" After this agreement was reached, supporters of merit pay for New York City public-school teachers expressed hope that the UFT, which had \\"always opposed individual merit pay initiatives,\\" would now follow Weingarten's example. Also in 2012, Weingarten criticized what she calls \\"merit pay schemes\\". =Teacher tenure= In 2009, when New York state Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan said that she had been prevented by a hip injury from introducing a measure to form a commission to study teacher-tenure reform—which the UFT had agreed to as a compromise measure—the New York Post editorialized that the legislative inaction which resulted \\"ha[d] the United Federation of Teachers chief's fingerprints all over it.\\" The Post argued that Nolan had managed to pass \\"77 other education bills ... while she was out for surgery,\\" and called it likely that Weingarten had influenced Nolan's decision. In a February 2011 interview, Weingarten acknowledged that \\"tenure needs to be reformed,\\" noting that the AFT had adopted recommendations for tenure reform. Observing that the issue of teacher tenure had \\"erupted recently, with many districts anticipating layoffs because of slashed budgets\\" and with mayors such as Michael R. Bloomberg in New York City and Cory A. Booker in Newark \\"attack[ing] seniority laws,\\" the New York Times reported that Weingarten had agreed to support some kind of tenure reform. =Teacher pension plans= Weingarten has strongly supported defined-benefit pension plans for teachers. Sol Stern argued in the conservative City Journal on June 25, 2009, that an agreement reached between Weingarten and the Bloomberg administration on teacher pensions would \\"probably wind up harming Gotham's students.\\" Under the agreement, Stern asserted, teachers would \\"make no sacrifices to help ease the city's economic and fiscal crisis\\" and would even get \\"a shorter work year,\\" with a ten-and-a- half-week summer vacation. In April 2013, Weingarten organized an action to confront Dan Loeb—a New York investment manager and board member of the New York chapter of lobbying organization StudentsFirst—over his opposition to defined-benefit pension plans for public employees. In the same month, the Wall Street Journal editorial board painted Weingarten as \\"trying to strong- arm pension trustees not to invest in hedge funds or private-equity funds that support education reform.\\" Weingarten had, according to the editorial board, \\"tried to sandbag hedge fund investor Dan Loeb at a conference sponsored by the Council of Institutional Investors,\\" describing her as troubled by the fact \\"that Mr. Loeb puts his own money behind school reform and charter schools.\\" Weingarten had, according to the Journal editorial, demanded a meeting with Loeb at the conference, but the editorial board wrote that he had \\"wisely declined the honor of showing up for this political mugging.\\" This \\"attempted ambush,\\" continued the Journal editorial, \\"coincide[d] with a new report that her union sent to pension trustees this week called 'Ranking Asset Managers,'\\" with the rankings based not on \\"return on investment\\" but on such matters \\"as a manager's position on collective bargaining, privatization [read: vouchers] or proposals to discontinue providing benefits through defined benefit plans.\\" The editorial board imputed \\"Ms. Weingarten's union fury\\" to her \\"know[ing that] unions are losing the moral and political debate over reform, as more Americans conclude that her policies are consigning millions of children to a life of diminished opportunity.\\" Weingarten had \\"bull[ied] pension trustees to bully hedge funds,\\" the editorial board charged, \\"to cut off funding for poor kids in Harlem. Every time we wonder if we're too cynical about unions, they remind us that we're not nearly cynical enough.\\" =School choice and charter schools= Weingarten has opposed charter schools and 'school choice'. In a City Journal essay in 1999, Sol Stern contrasted \\"Milwaukee's healthy approach to school choice\\" with what he termed Weingarten's promise to \\"fight with every resource at [her] disposal any attempt by the mayor to create a voucher system\\" in New York. Given what Stern described as the UFT's \\"impressive\\" resources, he deemed Mayor Giuliani courageous to take on \\"what promises to be,\\" Stern opined, \\"a long fight for the beleaguered parents of New York's schoolchildren.\\" Writing about a 1999 Emergency Coalition Against Vouchers \\"teach-in\\" attended by Weingarten, Stern asserted that \\"calling the rally ... a teach-in was almost Orwellian. Despite the nostalgic references to the Sixties,\\" Stern continued, \\"this event was the antithesis of insurgency.\\" Weingarten, he alleged, had made it clear that whatever the wishes of parents and the public, she \\"had the political clout to block even a tiny experimental voucher plan.\\" In a February 6, 2007, op-ed in the New York Post, Thomas W. Carroll of an advocacy organization called the Foundation for Education Reform & Accountability charged that Weingarten sought to unionize charter schools against the will of the teachers at those schools. To this end, Carroll wrote, Weingarten had tried pursue a unionization process known as card check, which involves the gathering signatures from pro-union teachers in lieu of a unionization vote by secret ballot. According to Carroll's op-ed, Weingarten had claimed that teachers had been fired from charter schools for wanting a union, but lacked the evidence to prove \\"these wild allegations.\\" In an April 10, 2009, article, The New York Post asserted that UFT activists had \\"sought to push City Council members into grilling Department of Education officials during a hearing on charter schools ... while taking it easy on union officials.\\" When those efforts—described by the article as \\"puppeteering\\"— became public, Weingarten told WNYW that she would \\"make some changes at the union to make sure that that never happens again\\" and said that former City Council Education Committee Chairwoman Eva Moskowitz, who had criticized the UFT's actions, \\"used to ask us all the time, when she was education chair, for questions to prep the City Council about what's really going on in schools.\\" Moskowitz, who after leaving the council had become founder and CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools, called Weingarten's charge \\"utterly false\\" and \\"defamatory.\\" The editorial board of the New York Post wrote, on August 6, 2011, about a PowerPoint presentation by an AFT lobbyist that \\"underscore[d] the sharp disparity between the union's public posture and its actual policies.\\" The presentation, according to the editorial's retelling, had \\"detailed how the union successfully rebuffed efforts\\" in Connecticut to enact a parent trigger law designed to let parents to \\"reconstitute a consistently failing school into a charter school.\\" After the presentation was made public, the editorial observed, an AFT statement said that the presentation did \\"not represent AFT's position.\\" The editorial quoted Gwen Samuel of the Connecticut Parents Union, a pro-parent trigger advocacy organization, saying: \\"I'm concerned that they [AFT] were so bold. This screams, 'I'm untouchable.'\\" The editorial board of the New York Post wrote on October 8, 2012, that the film Won't Back Down—a fictionalized account of a parent-trigger takeover at a neighborhood public school—had drawn what the editorial termed \\"the acid-laced enmity\\" of Weingarten, who had accused the film of employing \\"the most blatant stereotypes and caricatures I have ever seen\\" and of placing blame for failing schools \\"on the wrong culprit: America's teachers unions.\\" AFT members protested outside the film's premiere, the editorial noted. Rich Lowry, the editor of the conservative National Review, opined in the Post that Weingarten objected to the film not because its characters were, as she described them, stereotypes, but because \\"they are revelations.\\" =Teacher accountability= Weingarten has been frequently criticized over the years for resisting attempts to address the problem of teacher incompetence. When New York schools Chancellor Joel Klein announced a new peer-review process in 2007 to identify bad teachers, Weingarten called the plan \\"a stake in the heart of every teacher.\\" The editors of the New York Sun noted on September 17, 2007, that Weingarten, when asked on a talk show about teacher accountability, replied: \\"When people say to me, you know, well, why shouldn't teachers be, you know, judged on the test scores of their kids? I say to them ... would you want your oncologist, or your mom or dad's oncologist to be graded on the survival rates of his or her patients?\\" The Sun's editors noted that doctors are, in fact, \\"held accountable for performance. ... Would that teachers were held to such standards as exist in the oncology ward.\\" The New York Post noted on January 22, 2008, that \\"Weingarten promised a full-arsenal fight if the Department of Education attempts to judge individual teachers based on their students' test scores.\\" Regarding a new pilot program to determine teacher effectiveness, Weingarten commented in 2008: \\"There are so many educational and technical flaws in this concept that I find it shocking that the school system is even considering it.\\" Editorializing about Weingarten's acceptance speech at the 2008 AFT convention, the New York Post commented that she had \\"laid out her vision for 'community schools' that do everything but, well, teach.\\" The Post described her as envisioning a \\"one-stop nanny state ... owned and operated by Randi Weingarten & Co.\\" and suggested that her \\"push for all-purpose schools\\" was a way of \\"dodg[ing] teacher accountability in the one area schools are built for – teaching kids how to read, write and do numbers.\\" Writing in the New Yorker on August 31, 2009, Steven Brill quoted a school principal as saying that Weingarten \\"would protect a dead body in the classroom.\\"He quoted a teacher who had been suspended for incompetence, and who still earned over a hundred thousand dollars a year, as complaining that \\"Before Bloomberg and Klein took over, there was no such thing as incompetence.\\" United States Education Secretary Arne Duncan was scheduled to hold a press conference at PS 65 in Brooklyn on May 18, 2010, but after Weingarten made a call to Duncan complaining about the school's principal, Daysi Garcia, Duncan changed the press-conference venue. The New York Post editorialized that it was \\"no surprise that Garcia is the sort of principal Weingarten can't abide,\\" given that Garcia \\"makes her teachers work — and she demands results.\\" The Post cited a New Yorker article which had reported that Garcia had dared to identify and remove incompetent teachers, and consequently turned the school around, improving reading and math scores dramatically. The Post suggested that the lessons here were that \\"It's not just charter schools that get the union's goat — it's any school that gives kids a decent education by holding teachers accountable\\" and that \\"The union will fight to the very end.\\" Writing on May 30, 2013, about efforts to get \\"New York state's teachers unions to accept personal accountability as a bedrock principle of public-education reform,\\" Bob McManus of the New York Post commented that Weingarten \\"once seemed to have a conscience on such matters — but no more,\\" adhering to the principle that \\"No tenured teacher, under any circumstances, is to be held to account for any failing of any sort.\\" New York City schools chancellor Dennis M. Walcott wrote on September 6, 2013, that the Board of Education had managed, despite resistance by the UFT, to establish \\"an accountability system that included qualitative reviews and Progress Reports,\\" to end \\"the absurd practice of promoting students to higher grades if they lacked the skills to succeed,\\" and to institute \\"the first genuine teacher-evaluation system in the history of the school system.\\" =Private-school tax credits= Weingarten has been a severe critic of proposals to allow parents to use tax credits to help pay to send their children to private school. The editors of the New York Sun on November 21, 2006, quoted Weingarten's statement that allowing parents to apply tax credits to private-school tuition was \\"like saying government should reimburse people who drink bottled water instead of tap water — or those who park in a garage even when there is space on the street,\\" the editors of the New York Sun argued on November 21, 2006, that \\"bottled water and garage parking are luxuries, more expensive than tap water or street parking,\\" while educating a child in a New York Catholic school, for example, costs one- quarter as much as educating a public-school student. =Class size= Smaller class sizes have also been a major initiative of the UFT under Weingarten. She attempted to tie smaller class sizes to salaries in each of the three collective bargaining agreements she has negotiated, and linked class size to school repair and rebuilding issues. In 2003, Weingarten and the UFT pushed for a change to the New York City Charter which would force the city to reduce class sizes. The charter revision became caught in lawsuits and was eventually dropped, although Weingarten continued to advocate for smaller class sizes.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Group Wants the City Charter To Set Limits on Class Sizes\\", The New York Times, August 19, 2003; Gootman, Elissa \\"Class-Size Measure Rejected\\", The New York Times, September 18, 2003; Gootman, Elissa \\"Judge Allows Referendum On Class Size\\", The New York Times, October 3, 2003; Cooper, Michael \\"Appeals Court Blocks Vote On Lowering City Class Sizes\\", The New York Times, October 21, 2003; Saulny, Susan \\"Teachers' Union Tries to Gain Support for Smaller Class Sizes\\", The New York Times, May 14, 2006. A New York Sun editorial on May 20, 2003, questioned Weingarten's focus on this issue and challenged her argument that class size is a critical factor in learning, noting that \\"America has been reducing class sizes steadily for the last half century, with little to show in results.\\" =Teacher seniority= Weingarten has been a staunch supporter of the LIFO policy (\\"last in, first out\\"), otherwise known as teacher seniority. When Education Secretary Arne Duncan changed a February 2011 speech at the last minute to remove a negative reference to the LIFO policy, under which the last teacher to be hired must be the first one fired, the New York Post editorialized that the action \\"has the fingerprints of Randi Weingarten and the American Federation of Teachers all over it.\\" Asked in a 2011 Wall Street Journal interview about LIFO, Weingarten defended it, saying: \\"It's not the perfect mechanism but it's the best mechanism we have. You have cronyism and corruption and discrimination issues. We're saying let's do things the right way. We don't want to see people getting laid off based on who they know instead of what they know. We don't want to see people get laid off based on how much they cost.\\" =School building conditions= Poor schooling conditions, namely run-down public schools, have also drawn Weingarten's attention. The city of New York has neglected building conditions for many years. =Subsidized housing for teachers= In an October 5, 2007, New York Sun article, Eliot Brown wrote that a new Bronx apartment complex would be open only to UFT members: \\"Our members have said we want to live in the city and raise our families in the city, but we can't afford it, so this is something we've been looking at for a while,\\" Weingarten said. In December 2007, Weingarten cancelled the subsidized-housing deal after discovering that the developer would not be using unionized construction workers. Unions, she said, \\"should be standing up for each other.\\" The New York Post commented that \\"it clearly doesn't occur to Weingarten that using non-union labor is a major reason developers can build 'affordable' apartments\\" and that \\"she is imperilling a project that is beneficial to her teacher constituency for the 'greater good' of the broader labor movement.\\" The Post noted that Weingarten, in addition to running the UFT, \\"also chairs the Municipal Labor Committee – an umbrella group of more than 100 city unions.\\" Observing that because of her solidarity, \\"200 or so teachers may lose out on inexpensive apartments and – if the project falls through – several jobs won't be created at all,\\" the Post alluded to the \\"biblical adage ... that a man can't serve two masters.\\" =Teacher dress codes= Sol Stern wrote in the Summer 1998 issue of City Journal about Weingarten's opposition to a proposed dress code for teachers, calling it \\"a diversion from the real job at hand.\\" =Union solidarity= The New York Post criticized Weingarten in a February 6, 2013, editorial for signing on to a report by a coalition of unions and other groups calling for a range of new regulations to govern foreign workers. \\"We're not surprised the AFT is on board,\\" the Post commented. \\"If you think of our public schools primarily as a jobs program, it makes perfect sense.\\" =Plagiarized speech= A speech that Weingarten gave in 2011 turned out to have been plagiarized from a NY 1 series on a flawed Board of Education computer system. NY 1 responded, saying \\"When a journalist, politician or student uses someone else's words without attribution in a speech or a paper, it's called plagiarism – and it's often enough to get a journalist fired, a politician embarrassed or a student kicked out of school\\". =WTU conflict= In 2010, the AFT and Weingarten specifically were charged with interfering in the local elections of the Washington Teachers Union (WTU). The elections had been scheduled for May but postponed because of a dispute over procedural questions. In August of that year, Weingarten imposed a deadline on WTU President George Parker to comply with an order \\"to hold a mid-September election for new officers and delegates, or the contest will be taken out of his hands and conducted by the national parent organization.\\" Parker objected that Weingarten had no authority to interfere in this manner. Weingarten ultimately took over the election. Personal life On October 11, 2007, Weingarten publicly announced she is a lesbian. Weingarten introduced Liz Margolies, 54, a psychotherapist and health care activist, as her partner while accepting the Empire State Pride Agenda's 2007 Community Service Award from Christine Quinn.Melago, Carrie \\"Teachers Union President Comes Out Publicly As A Lesbian\\", New York Daily News, October 13, 2007. By December 2012, she was in a relationship with Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah.Hoffman, Allison \\"New York’s New Firebrand Rabbi\\", Tablet Mag, May 3, 2013. They married March 25, 2018. In December 2014, Weingarten wrote in Jezebel that she had almost been raped just after her junior year in college.

Hot Pockets was founded by the Chef America Inc. company. Since April 20, 2002, they have been produced by Nestlé. Product An uncooked Hot Pocket A cooked Hot Pocket, cut to show filling There are 50 varieties of the traditional Hot Pocket, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner varieties. Nestlé also offers Lean Pockets, Pretzel Bread Hot Pockets, Hot Pockets Croissant Crust (formerly called Croissant Pockets), Hot Pockets Breakfast items, Hot Pockets Breakfast/Snack Bites, and Hot Pockets Side shots. Nestlé formerly produced Hot Pie Express, Hot Pocket Pizza Minis (originally called Hot Pockets Pizza Snacks), Hot Pockets Subs, Hot Pockets Calzones, Hot Pockets Panini, and Hot Pockets Breakfast fruit pastries. Hot Pockets are viewed as \\"an after school staple\\". Individual Hot Pockets contain about 350 calories. History Hot Pockets were developed by Paul Merage and his brother David through their company Chef America Inc. Chef America invented a packaging sleeve and dough formula to keep its calzone-like sandwiches crispy when cooked in a microwave. In 1980, Chef America introduced its first stuffed sandwich, the Tastywich, the predecessor of the Hot Pocket. Hot Pockets supplanted Tastywiches in 1983, first sold to restaurants because they were easier to break into than retail stores. On May 22, 2002, Chef America was sold to Nestlé. Hot Pocket products were \\"a $2 billion category of frozen sandwiches and snacks\\". Breakfast-style Hot Pockets were introduced in 2001. =Sales= Citing reduced sales, in 2011 Nestlé announced that it would cut employee numbers at its California factory. U.S. sales were about $610 million in 2010—down $44 million from the previous year—according to Euromonitor International data. Paul Grimwood took over Nestlé SA's struggling U.S operations in 2011. In an attempt to bolster the failing brand by improving supply chain, Grimwood made the decision to drop the calzone version of Hot Pockets and the quesadillas Lean Pockets, reducing the number of doughs needed. Nestlé executive Chris Johnson points to an end of extended SNAP benefits in 2013 as the cause of the fallen sales, stating SNAP benefit recipients are \\"a big part of the consumption of this particular product.\\" Comedic references *Comedian Jim Gaffigan is well known for his material poking fun at Hot Pockets. This material is so popular among fans that he is regularly offered Hot Pockets while on tour. Nestlé confirms that they had no influence with this stand-up comedy. *In a 2015 installment of the comic strip Wizard of Id the Huns employed a trojan Hot Pocket in their perpetual war against the Kingdom of Id, with the intention of causing them to kill themselves slowly. *Actor DJ Qualls plays a hacker in the 2003 science fiction film The Core who subsists solely on the microwaveable snack. Recall In 2014, Nestle USA recalled 238,000 cases of its Hot Pockets because they may have contained meat from a massive recall of about of meat from \\"diseased and unsound\\" animals. Nestle stated that \\"a small quantity of meat\\" from the Rancho Feeding Corp was used to make Hot Pockets. The USDA described the food as \\"unfit for humans\\". This Rancho Feeding Corp meat recall was based out of a production facility in California, but the recalled Hot Pockets were distributed nationwide. The two types of Hot Pockets involved in the recall were the Philly Steak and Cheese and the Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese. A full federal inspection was not performed, and there were no illnesses reported in connection to this recall. Customers who bought the recalled products were refunded by contacting Nestle Consumer Service.

It is thought to date from 1400 and was collected in 1868 by Francis James Child, as Child Ballad number 78.Francis James Child, Scottish and English Popular Ballads, \\"The Unquiet Grave\\" One of the more common tunes used for the ballad is the same as that used for the English ballad \\"Dives and Lazarus\\" and the Irish pub favorite \\"Star of the County Down\\". Synopsis A man mourns his true love for \\"a twelve month and a day\\". At the end of that time, the dead woman complains that his weeping is keeping her from peaceful rest. He begs a kiss. She tells him it would kill him. When he persists, wanting to join her in death, she explains that once they were both dead their hearts would simply decay, and that he should enjoy life while he has it. Variants The version noted by Cecil SharpCecil J. Sharp (Ed) (1975) One Hundred English Folksongs (For Medium Voice), Dover, ends with \\"When will we meet again? / When the autumn leaves that fall from the trees / Are green and spring up again.\\" Many verses in this ballad have parallels in other ballads: Bonny Bee Hom, Sweet William's Ghost and some variants of The Twa Brothers.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 234, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The motif that excessive grief can disturb the dead is found also in German and Scandinavian ballads, as well as Greek and Roman traditions.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 234-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Ween plays a version featuring a woman weeping for a dead man, on their 1997 album The Mollusk entitled \\"Cold Blows the Wind\\".

It is a member of the Fraser Valley Regional District; its immediate neighbour is the District of Kent and included in it, the town of Agassiz. It is a resort community known for its hot springs, and has a population of just over 1500 people. It is named after Benjamin Harrison, a former deputy governor for the Hudson's Bay Company. History The Village of Harrison Hot Springs has been a small resort community since 1886, when the opening of the Canadian Pacific Railway brought the lakeside springs within a short carriage ride of the transcontinental mainline. In its first promotion as a resort it was known as St. Alice's Well, although it had been discovered decades earlier when a party of goldfield-bound travellers on Harrison Lake capsized into what they thought was their doom, only to discover the lake at that spot was not freezing, but warm. Although the resort flourished in a low-key fashion for years after this discovery was exploited by hoteliers, the Village of Harrison Hot Springs was not incorporated until 1949. Its namesake hot springs are a major attraction for tourists who come to stay at the village's spa-resort. The hot springs themselves were originally used and revered by the Sts'Ailes (Chehalis) First Nations people who live along the Harrison River nearby. There are two hot springs, the \\"Potash\\", with a temperature of 40 °C, and the \\"Sulphur\\", with a temperature of 65 °C. According to Harrison Hot Springs Resort, the waters average 1300 ppm of dissolved mineral solids, one of the highest concentrations of any mineral spring. This hot spring is one of several lining the valley of the Lillooet River and Harrison Lake. The northernmost of the Lillooet River hot springs is at Meager Creek, north of Whistler, with another well-known one to the east of Whistler at Skookumchuck Hot Springs, midway between Pemberton and Port Douglas. One feature of this chain of hot springs is that the Harrison Hot Springs vent is the most sulfuric, and there is consistently less sulfur content as one goes northwards, with the springs at Meager Creek having almost no scent at all. Geography=Megatsunami risk= Some geologists consider that an unstable rock face at Mount Breakenridge above the north end of the giant fresh-water fjord of Harrison Lake in the Lower Mainland of southwestern British Columbia, Canada, could collapse into the lake, generating a large wave that might destroy the town of Harrison Hot Springs (located at its south end).

The building comprises a full city block between Lexington and Third Avenues and 58th and 59th Streets. The complex features two towers constructed above a steel office and retail section, separated by a seven-story atrium. The design of the courtyard at One Beacon Court, which connects 58th and 59th Streets, was inspired by other historic New York enclosures such as Grand Central Terminal, the reading room of the New York Public Library Main Branch, and the skating rink at Rockefeller Center; glass walls curve around the perimeter of the courtyard, tilting slightly inward as they rise. Tenants Portion of the Bloomberg L.P. interior Although the building was originally planned to be entirely residential, Bloomberg L.P. negotiated a deal with Vornado Realty Trust to lease of office space at the base of the tower. STUDIOS Architecture did the design, which includes rows of uniform desks for approximately 4,000 employees and a large central atrium known as \\"the Link\\" that overlooks the courtyard. Paul Goldberger, in the August 6, 2007, issue of The New Yorker magazine, lauded the Bloomberg offices as \\"a newsroom truly designed for the electronic age ... a dazzling work environment tucked inside a refined but conventional skyscraper.\\" By 2011, Bloomberg L.P. added another of office space at 731 Lexington Avenue and announced plans to expand to an additional in the former Philip Morris building at 120 Park Avenue.

At least four towers have been built on Cape Poge, with many moves. In 1801 the first wooden Cape Poge Lighthouse was built for $2,000. During the War of 1812 the light was extinguished for a few months and its apparatus was hidden in the cellar of a Chappaquiddick house. This first lighthouse was moved in 1825 and again in 1838 due to an eroding bluff. In 1844 a new tower was built for $1,600 and in 1857 supplied with a fourth order Fresnel lens. However, in 1878 it was reported that the keeper's house would probably \\"fall into the sea within two years.\\" A third lighthouse was therefore built in 1880. Finally, in 1893 the current, , white conical wood tower was constructed, inland from the previous one. The current tower has been moved four times, in 1907, 1922, 1960, and in 1987 when it became the first lighthouse to be moved by helicopter). The light was automated in 1943. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The current light is a solar powered beacon that flashes white every 6 seconds and is visible for . The light's focal plane is above mean high water. The light is currently active and is under the auspices of the United States Coast Guard, however the tower has been transferred and is now owned and operated by The Trustees of Reservations, who provide tours during the summer season.

Nationwide Series=Car No. 2 history= The No. 2 car at Road America in 2011 This team ran full-time in 2011 with former Sprint Cup driver Elliott Sadler driving and Ernie Cope as the crew chief. The team struggled the early portion of the season, but soon found momentum and battled with Roush Fenway Racing driver Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. for the Nationwide Series points lead. Despite the No. 2 team going winless in 2011, Sadler finished 2nd in points. The team returned in 2012 under the RCR banner. =Car No. 4 history= For 2009, Harvick planned a one-car effort, but with additional sponsorship for the Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen from Schick Canada, J.

He started 40th and finished in the 42nd position due to rear end problems. He drove again at Darlington Raceway and finished 15th. Tony Raines ended the season at the Ford 300 with a 35th-place finish after being involved in a crash. Tony Stewart won the team's first NASCAR Busch Series race in 2005 by winning the Hershey's Take 5 300 at Daytona International Speedway in February. Stewart and Raines shared the 33 that season, with Stewart running races with Old Spice sponsorship, and Raines with Yard Man/Outdoor Channel backing. Raines collected nine top-ten finishes and finished 20th in the points despite only running 23 races. Stewart's lone win in 10 races came at Daytona and had only three top-five finishes. KHI development driver Burney Lamar joined the 33 for a pair of races as well, his best finish a 34th at Homestead-Miami Speedway. In 2002 Canadian driver Ron Fellows befriended Harvick and asked for a ride. Harvick agreed to put Fellows in some Busch Series races in the No. 33 Chevy on several occasions during the years. Fellows performed well on the road courses and had some nice performances on some oval tracks. The last time he raced for Kevin Harvick Inc. was in 2007 at Watkins Glen. Kevin Harvick asked Fellows to drive on occasion for KHI in 2007 for one more year and Fellows agreed. In 2007 at Montreal, Fellows almost won the first NBS race there, but placed 4th after a late crash. The 2006 again started strong as Stewart again drove the No. 33 to a win at Daytona with teammate Lamar finishing second in the No. 77, marking the first time that the Linville family had fielded a winner in the series, dating to its inaugural year. A variety of drivers competed in the No. 33 during the 2006 season, including Stewart, Harvick, Hornaday, and development drivers Sean Caisse and Aaron Fike. The team finished tenth in the standings at the season. Harvick, Stewart, Raines, and development driver Cale Gale shared the No. 33 Chevrolet in 2007, with sponsorship coming from Old Spice, Camping World, and RoadLoans.com. Harvick, Gale, and Hornaday split the 33 full-time in 2008, scoring fifteen finishes of eighth or better between them. The 33 returned in 2009 with sponsors Rheem, Jimmy John's, Armour Vienna Sausages and Copart. The 33 was driven by Harvick, Stewart, Ryan Newman, Ron Hornaday Jr. along with Gale and Kelly Bires in one race deals. Kevin Harvick finally drove his own equipment to victory in the Scotts Turf Builder 300 at Bristol Motor Speedway on March 21, 2009. This would be the first time he scored a victory in his own equipment after trying for 5 years since the inception of his race team during 2004. The driver lineup changed for 2010 with Harvick, Hornaday, Mike Bliss, Elliott Sadler and Road Ringer Max Papis at Road America and Circuit Gilles Villeneuve with Harvick taking 3 victories at Vegas, Nashville, and Richmond. For 2011, the No. 33 carried dual sponsorship from both Rheem and Menards, with Kevin Harvick, Clint Bowyer, Austin Dillon, and new RCR driver Paul Menard splitting the driving duties. Former Red Bull driver Scott Speed intended to drive at the May Iowa race, but his commitment to Dragon Racing for the 2011 Indianapolis 500 prevented him from competing. Speed would drive the car at Montreal and Max Papis drove at Road America. Truck Series driver David Mayhew would make his series debut at the fall Iowa race. The 33 team would finish fourth in owners points, but would go winless.Kevin Harvick Inc.

Nationwide No. 33 News, October 29th, 2010 The 33 team will be transferred over to RCR for 2012. =Car No. 77 history= KHI first entered its second Busch Series team in the 2004 fall race at Atlanta Motor Speedway when Tony Stewart piloted the No. 92 McDonald's/Powerade Chevrolet. As a co-promotion in the event, team owner Kevin Harvick drove the No. 29 Powerade/McDonald's Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing. The team returned in 2005 renumbered as the No. 83 to run five races. Burney Lamar attempted the car's first race at Nashville Superspeedway but failed to qualify for the event. Wally Dallenbach Jr. made the car's first race at Watkins Glen International, where he finished nineteenth in the Mr. Clean Auto-Dry Wash car. Tony Stewart drove the car at Richmond with Old Spice sponsoring and Tony Raines drove the car with Cub Cadet funding at Kansas, finishing 40th and 17th, respectively. For 2006, the team signed Dollar General as a sponsor and switched to the No. 77 with Lamar driving and competing for NASCAR Rookie of the Year. He opened the season with a runner-up finish at Daytona, and had two additional top-tens and led the Rookie of the Year standings until summer. During the race weekend at Kansas in 2006, Harvick announced he had removed Lamar from the No. 77, due to Dollar General wanting Cup drivers in the No. 77 and hired 2000 Winston Cup champion Bobby Labonte to drive the car for the rest of the season. Labonte, Harvick, and Kertus Davis were scheduled share the 77 for the 2007 season. Labonte brought the number 77 to its first victory at Talladega on April 28, 2007. Davis was later released, with Ron Hornaday Jr. filling in for races that Davis was scheduled to drive for the team, after Davis did not crack the top 30 in his five starts in the No. 77. In 2008 Cale Gale drove the car in three races with sponsorship from VFW and Rheem. Camping World Truck Series=Truck No. 2 history= The No. 2 truck in 2008, driven by Jack Sprague Harvick doing a burnout at Pocono after winning the race there in 2011 The No. 2 truck originally ran as a second truck to the No. 6 in 2004 for a pair of races as the No. 92. Harvick drove with sponsorship from Snap-On Tools and GM Goodwrench sponsoring, with Harvick finished in the top-five in both races. It ran again in 2005 for two races with Harvick and another two with Lamar. Harvick had the best finish of fifth. Tony Stewart attempted the race at Richmond, but, surprisingly, failed to qualify for the race, despite winning the past two Richmond truck races, mainly from NASCAR's new all-exempt tour policy. The truck in 2007 was used for most of the season, running a Part-Time Schedule with a variety of drivers, from KHI developmental driver, Cale Gale to Richard Childress Racing Nextel Cup drivers, Harvick and Clint Bowyer in the No. 2. For the 2008 season, Jack Sprague was signed on to pilot the No. 2 truck Full Time with sponsorship from American Commercial Lines. However, Sprague was unable to find victory lane and was released on October 8. Harvick, Gale, and Ryan Newman shared this truck for the remainder of the season. Newman drove this truck to victory lane in the final fall race at Atlanta with a late pass on Ron Hornaday Jr. Former motocross champion Ricky Carmichael was signed to KHI in 2009, which changed its number to No. 4 out of deference to Carmichael, who raced No. 4 for most of his career. Monster Energy sponsored the truck. Carmichael was caught up in an accident in the season opener. The team rebounded and scored a better finish at the Auto Club Speedway. Carmichael was set to make 14 of the 25 Camping World Truck Series races, with J. R. Fitzpatrick filling out the rest of the schedule. Carmichael and Monster Energy left KHI at the end of the season to race for Turner Motorsports. In 2010, the truck returned to being the 2 with Harvick driving, along with Elliott Sadler, Clint Bowyer, Ken Schrader, and Shelby Howard sharing the duties. The 2 team garnered 5 wins, 3 by Harvick (Atlanta, Martinsville, Gateway), 1 by Clint Bowyer (Phoenix), and 1 by Sadler (Pocono). In addition the team finished with 11 top fives and 16 top tens.http://www.nascar.com/races/truck/2010/data/standings_owner.html The team finished 5th in the final owners points. For 2011, Bowyer, Sadler, and Harvick primarily drove the 2 truck, and Cale Gale returned for six races with Rheem on board. The team would capture 7 wins, with Bowyer winning at Phoenix and Kansas, Harvick won 3 in a row at Pocono, Michigan, and Bristol, Ron Hornaday, Jr. drove the truck for 3 races late in the season, winning at Kentucky and Las Vegas, while Harvick won at Texas to easily take the Owners Championship. For 2012, the team was absorbed by Richard Childress Racing. =Truck No. 8 history= Pocono in 2011 The No. 8 truck originally ran as a third truck in 2009 for four races as the No. 2. In 2009, Ryan Newman and Harvick finished with four top fives in the four starts, with Harvick winning in Martinsville. Kevin Harvick Inc. signed Nelson Piquet Jr. to drive this truck Full Time in 2011.http://www.kevinharvick.com/index.php/news/article/kevin-harvick- inc.-signs-brazilian-driver-nelson-piquet-jr/ Nelson will be running NASCAR Rookie of the Year. This is one of the first times the 8 truck has run since 1997 when Joe Nemechek's brother John Nemechek was killed. In 2011, Piquet ran full-time with sponsors Qualcomm, Autotrac, Bozzano, Jontex and others. Piquet would finish 10th in his inaugural NASCAR season, but came runner up to Joey Coulter for rookie of the year honors. This truck was bought out by Eddie Sharp Racing for 2012. =Truck No. 6 history= The No. 6 truck at Atlanta in 2005 The No. 6 truck was Kevin Harvick Inc.'s first ever truck. It was built in 2001 when Harvick started his self-owned team for 2002 modeled after RCR and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. Initially the company was called Kevin Harvick Motorsports, but it was renamed to KHI in later 2002. In its first race it was driven by Rick Carelli and finished in 5th at Daytona. In its second race at Darlington it finished in 4th place. At Martinsville, Harvick intentionally spun Coy Gibbs causing NASCAR to park the team for the balance of the event. When Harvick lied to reporters, his sponsors and fans; about not intentionally crashing Gibbs, this led to a suspension from the cup race the next morning, a $25,000 fine and a 25 points loss for the truck series. Following this incident Harvick did not race the next event at Gateway to make amends. Later that year, Harvick won the team's first win at Phoenix in autumn and the next year the No. 6 team was folded into the No. 33 team (see below.) =Truck No. 33 history= Bristol in 2007 Daytona in 2008 The No. 33 truck was KHI's first venture into NASCAR. It debuted as the No. 6 Twizzler/PayDay/Sonic Drive-In Chevrolet Silverado in a partnership between the Harvicks and Rick Carelli in 2001. Harvick started fourth and finished second at Richmond International Raceway. Carelli drove the team's next race at the 2002 Florida Dodge Dealers 250 and finished fifth. Harvick competed in five races and picked up his first career Truck win at Phoenix International Raceway. In 2003, Harvick ran an additional six races and won once again at Phoenix. Other drivers drove for the team that year were Ed Berrier, Brandon Miller, and Randy LaJoie. Miller had the best finish of eighth at Mesa Marin Raceway. GM Goodwrench climbed aboard as the team's first primary sponsor, and Matt Crafton was hired away from ThorSport Racing as the team's driver. Crafton posted six top-five finishes and finished fifth in points, but left at the end of the season to return to his previous ride. He was replaced by two-time champion Ron Hornaday Jr., who captured a win at Atlanta Motor Speedway and was named the series' Most Popular Driver. At the end of 2005, KHI switched numbers with Roush Fenway Racing to become the No. 33, with the No. 6 going to Roush Fenway. Hornaday Jr. began the year unsponsored but won at Mansfield Motorsports Speedway and finished seventh in points after obtaining sponsorship from Allstate Employer Services. He began 2007 with new sponsorship from Camping World, picked up four victories, and won the 2007 Craftsman Truck Series championship. In 2008, Hornaday won six times but finished second in the championship standings. In 2009 he'd win his fourth championship, a week before the last race of the season. In 2010, the 33 team found itself in a slump. Due to the Food and Drug Administration passing a new rule that bans the advertisement of tobacco products, Longhorn dropped its sponsorship mid season, forcing the 33 to run with one race deals until E-Z-GO signed on with a few races remaining. The 33 team brushed off the bad luck with a win at O'Reilly Raceway Park at Indianapolis where he would hold off Kyle Busch. Hornaday Jr. won again at Martinsville and ended up 7th in points. For 2011, Hornaday returned to the 33 team and won early in the year at Texas. However, the team struggled midway through the season and lost ground in the points. After Harvick had Hornaday switch over to the 2 truck, Cale Gale would take over the 33 for 2 races while Mike Wallace would drive at Talladega and win his first Truck race since 2000. Hornaday returned to the 33 for the last 3 races of the season and finished second at Martinsville, but was knocked out of the championship hunt at Texas by Kyle Busch and finished 13th at Homestead, ending up 4th in points. The 33 was driven by Cale Gale full-time in 2012 with Eddie Sharp Racing fielding the truck. Sale and reorganization In September 2011, it was announced that KHI would cease to exist following that season, with its teams and equipment being absorbed or bought by other organizations. Harvick's Cup team Richard Childress Racing restarted its Nationwide Series program by merging it with that of KHI, moving the No. 2 team of Elliott Sadler which would finish second in points and the flagship No. 33 which Harvick would continue to drive to the RCR banner. Kevin Harvick's truck program was primarily sold to Eddie Sharp Racing, acquiring the No. 8 truck and No. 33 truck. While Nelson Piquet Jr. moved to Turner Scott Motorsports, development driver Cale Gale and longtime sponsor Rheem went with the No. 33 to ESR, winning the 2012 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. KHI’s 2 truck was also sold to RCR and Harvick continued to drive it in 2012 for 3 races. Harvick's good friend and most successful driver Ron Hornaday Jr. moved on to Joe Denette Motorsports (now NTS Motorsports), which received equipment and support from KHI, for 2012 and 2013 driving their No. 9 truck. Harvick continued to drive NTS's 14 truck in a partial schedule in 2013, and NTS also moved into the former KHI shop prior to the season. According to Harvick, the sale of the team overall was so he could focus winning a Cup championship. For the Xfinity Series program specifically, Harvick stated that the similarity between them and the Cup cars (same chassis and similar bodies) made the costs and resource requirements too great for a non-Cup-affiliated team to function. Kevin Harvick Incorporated currently operates as a sports marketing and management firm, which includes MMA fighters as well as former teammate Jeff Burton. They now represent Harrison Burton, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Ryan Preece along with others.

It was released on March 18, 2002 in North America; March 21, 2002 in Japan; and May 17, 2002 in PAL regions. Set in an alternate history science fiction world where the British Empire rules Earth and various extrasolar planets, the game tasks the player with exterminating the giant insects that infest the colonies of the planet Tir na Nog. Originally in development for the Sega Dreamcast, the game was moved to the Xbox to take advantage of its improved hardware and controls. Gunvalkyrie received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and innovation, but criticized its steep learning curve stemming from its complex controls. Gameplay The gameplay is very different from most third-person shooters, due to a unique dual analog control scheme, which is the main contributor to the steep learning curve of the game. Players travel to various worlds investigating the disappearance of several colonies, with only giant, mutated, insectoid creatures left behind. These insectoids comprise the bulk of the enemies players face along the way. Players control Kelly or Saburouta with both analog sticks, the left controlling forward/backward movement and turning, while the right aims their weapons, and when clicked, allows quick turns. Clicking in the left stick while pointing in a direction causes the character to boost. The left trigger is a boost/jump, and when combined with the left analog boost, can be strung together into combos to keep the player off the ground entirely, which is a necessity for some levels. Face buttons are used to select weapons, and the right trigger fires the selected weapon. The game comprises ten levels, the story unfolding via text between levels, or the occasional in-game cutscene. At the beginning of most levels, excluding boss battles, players have the choice of picking either Kelly or Saburouta. Kelly's primary weapon is fast but weaker, and she's overall faster and more maneuverable. Saburouta is slower, has more limited maneuverability in the air, and carries a stronger primary weapon, the Matchlock Cannon. Basically the two characters make up the two difficulty settings, with Kelly being the \\"Normal\\", and Saburouta being the \\"Advanced\\" setting. The real difference being that Kelly's style allowed several lock-on targets, while Saburouta's weapon splashed and was aimed at specific targets. Because of this, Kelly's gameplay is more frantic and requires less direct focus, while Saburota required specific aiming and direct attacks to be effective. Kelly is also the only character to upgrade her gearskin. The artistic style of the game is similar to the steampunk subgenre of fiction, but the game's designers prefer to call it \\"elec-punk,\\" described as a step even further, with the harnessing of electricity for imaginative new uses. The game's stages are divided into indoor mechanical-looking levels, with many gears and ornate metalwork, and outdoor stages, set in very organic-looking valleys, craters, and other fantastic otherworldly locations. Plot The game takes place in an alternate history in 1906 where the British Empire rules all of Earth and several extrasolar colony worlds, powered by technology brought to the planet by Halley's Comet in 1835. An unknown substance known as Halley's Core was found throughout the world, and certain individuals who came in contact with it and gained superhuman abilities became known as \\"Halley's Chosen.\\" The first of these was a scientist named Dr. Hebble Gate, who was affected by the comet while in his mother's womb. With his superhuman mind he harnessed the power of Halley's Core and discovered a wide range of scientific breakthroughs, including fusion and nuclear power, genetic engineering, computers, space travel and countless others. With these technologies the British Empire quickly conquered the earth, and Gate is famous as the man responsible. A complete mystery to all, Gate also holds great power over economic, political and military affairs, and is the founder of the Hebble Foundation and the GunValkyrie (GV) Organization, composed of Halley's Chosen throughout the world to prevent the misuse of technology. He suddenly disappears, throwing the world into shock, and has been missing for four years by the time the game begins. In addition to his disappearance, the residents of the colonized planet of Tir na Nog have also disappeared, with an outbreak of large alien creatures that resemble giant insects in their place. It is also believed that before his disappearance, Gate was conducting research on how to strengthen the colonists through genetic modification, and it is speculated that the insects and colonists are one and the same. In response, members of an elite military force within the GV organization, known as \\"Team Dolphin\\" (established 1887) is sent to investigate Gate's disappearance as well as the situation on Tir na Nog. Leading the investigation is Gate's only daughter, Lieutenant Meridian Poe, who survives on a life support system developed by her father after he surgically removed her head and disappeared with her body. The two playable characters are Kelly O'Lenmey, born in Ballymun, Ireland, a collected idealist who once aided the Irish Republic in their fight for independence until their methods caused her to leave and join the GV, and Saburouta Mishima, born in Kyushu, Japan, an exiled Samurai of the Meiji Restoration who was saved by the GV after he was unjustly sentenced to capital punishment. Dr. Gate's fate at the end of the game is left ambiguous, as the Poe's Report documents presented throughout the game reveal that a body was eventually discovered, but its identity is not confirmed. Development GunValkyrie was originally developed for the Sega Dreamcast. Its visual style was very similar to the final Xbox version. The Dreamcast version's distinguishing feature was that during the game's development, GunValkyrie utilized a unique control scheme using both a light gun and a controller. This control scheme was dropped when development shifted to the Xbox version. The game's soundtrack, composed by Teruhiko Nakagawa and Tatsuyuki Maeda, was also marketed during the game's release. It was during this time period that TokyoPop was publishing Sega soundtrack releases in the United States, including GunValkyrie, Virtua Fighter 4, Panzer Dragoon Orta and the Sonic Adventure 2 Official Soundtrack. GunValkyrie Official Soundtrack was released on April 2, 2002. Unusually, and in contrast to the titles mentioned above, a soundtrack CD for the game was not released in Japan.

The most common fillings are: al ragù or al sugo, filled with ragù (meat or mince, slow-cooked at low temperature with tomato sauce and spices), mozzarella and/or caciocavallo cheese, and often peas, and al burro or ô burru, filled with ham and mozzarella or besciamella. A number of regional variants exist which differ in fillings and shape. Arancini al ragù produced in eastern Sicily have a conical shape inspired by the volcano Etna. Etymology Arancini is a diminutive of arancia, or 'orange'. The name, which is translated as \\"little orange\\", derives from their shape and colour which, after cooking, is reminiscent of an orange. In Italian, arancini is grammatically plural (); the corresponding singular is arancino ( or arancina). History An open arancino, showing the rice and ragù stuffing Arancini are said to have originated in 10th-century Sicily at a time when the island was under Arab rule. In the cities of Palermo, Siracusa, and Trapani in Sicily, arancini are a traditional food for the feast of Santa Lucia on 13 December when bread and pasta are not eaten. This commemorates arrival of a grain supply ship on Santa Lucia's day in 1646, relieving a severe famine.Giuseppina Siotto, Vegetaliana, note di cucina italiana vegetale: La cucina vegetariana e vegana, 2014, , chapter 14 Today, with the increasing popularity of this finger food in modern Italian food culture, arancini are found all year round at most Sicilian food outlets, particularly in Palermo, Messina and Catania. The dish was traditionally created to provide a full meal to Federico II di Svevia during his hunting activities. Ingredients and variations Conical-shaped arancini photographed in Messina The most common type of arancini sold in Sicilian cafés are arancini al ragù, which typically consist of meat in a tomato sauce, rice, and mozzarella or other cheese. Many cafés also offer arancini al burro (with butter or béchamel sauce) or specialty arancini, such as arancini con funghi (mushrooms), con pistacchi (pistachios), or con melanzane (aubergine). In Roman cuisine, supplì are similar but are commonly filled with cheese (different preparation methods and filling distribution). In Naples, rice balls are called . In a variant recipe originating among the Italian diaspora in Southeast Texas, the arancini are stuffed with a chili-seasoned filling. In popular culture In Italian literature, Inspector Montalbano, the main character of Andrea Camilleri's detective novels, is a well-known lover of arancini especially those made by Adelina Cirrinciò, his housekeeper and cook. The success of the book series and the television adaptation has contributed to making this dish known outside of Italy.

He was a tour guide of historic battlefields for The Smithsonian Associates and served as Chief Historian of the National Park Service from 1981 to 1994, before succeeding to Chief Historian Emeritus. Early life Bearss was born in Billings, Montana, the elder son of Omar Effinger Bearss and Virginia Louise Morse Bearss, and grew up on the family cattle ranch near Sarpy, Montana. His father, a Marine in World WarI, read accounts of military campaigns to Bearss, and his lifelong interest in military history was inspired by John Thomason's biography of Confederate cavalry general J.E.B. Stuart. World War II Bearss graduated from Hardin High School in May 1941 and hitchhiked around the United States, visiting his first Civil War battlefields. He enlisted in the Marine Corps on April 28, 1942, and by July was on a troop transport to the Pacific War. He was with the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion in the invasion of Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands and 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, in New Britain. On January 2, 1944, Bearss was severely wounded at \\"Suicide Creek\\" (Cape Gloucester, New Britain) by Japanese machine gun fire.Ripley, M. [Mary Ripley]. (2007, August 21). Edwin C. Bearss, USMC [video file]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfqis9SLCUA He was evacuated to California, and spent 26 months recovering in various hospitals. He was honorably discharged from the Marines as a corporal on March 15, 1946, and returned home to Montana. Postwar education Bearss used the G.I. Bill to finance his education at Georgetown University, from which he obtained a B.S. degree in Foreign Service studies in 1949. He worked for three years in the United States Navy Hydrographic Office in Maryland and used his spare time to visit numerous Civil War battlefields in the East. He received his M.A. in history from Indiana University in 1955, writing his thesis on Confederate General Patrick Cleburne. As part of his research, he visited the Western Theater battlefields on which Cleburne fought, telling friends, \\"You can't describe a battlefield unless you walk it.\\" In February 2005, Lincoln College awarded Bearss an honorary doctorate, and in May 2010, Gettysburg College awarded him an honorary doctorate of humane letters. On the battlefield of Shiloh in 1954, he made a career decision inspired by the park historian he met, Charles E. (Pete) Shedd: interpretation of battles in the field was far more interesting than the academic study of history in an office. Although attracted to a National Park Service career, he first joined the Office of the Chief of Military History, U.S. Army, but soon took work as an historian at Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg, Mississippi. It was at Vicksburg that he met his wife, Margie Riddle Bearss (1925-2006), also a Civil War historian; they were married on July 30, 1958. They first lived in the Leila Luckett House in Vicksburg formerly occupied by then-Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's soldiers in 1863, and eventually had three children: Sara Beth, Edwin Cole, Jr., and Mary Virginia (Jenny). National Park Service At Vicksburg, Bearss did the research leading him and two friends to the long-lost Union gunboat U.S.S. Cairo. He also located two forgotten forts at Grand Gulf, Mississippi. He was promoted in 1958 to Southeast regional historian, working out of Vicksburg, but he spent the majority of his time on the road, visiting virtually every battlefield in the country. As popular interest in the Civil War increased with the centennial celebrations starting in 1961, Bearss was recognized as more knowledgeable on the battlefields than virtually anyone else and he was enlisted to develop a variety of new parks, including Pea Ridge and Wilson's Creek. During his long NPS career, he also led efforts in Fort Smith; Stones River, Fort Donelson; battlefields around Richmond, Bighorn Canyon; the Eisenhower Farm at Gettysburg; the gold miners' route over Chilkoot Pass; President Lyndon B. Johnson's Ranch; Fort Moultrie; Fort Point; William Howard Taft House; Fort Hancock at the Boston Navy Yard; and the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. In 1966, Bearss was transferred to Washington, D.C. On November 1, 1981, he was named Chief Historian of the National Park Service, a position he held until 1994. From 1994 to 1995, he served as special assistant to the director. After his retirement in 1995, he received the title Chief Historian Emeritus, which he held until his death. Sea Research Society In 1972, Bearss became a founding member of the Board of Advisors of Sea Research Society and participated in the creation of its College of Marine Arts. He was active in the society's efforts to raise the wreck of the Civil War submarine Hunley, which had been found off Charleston, South Carolina, in 1995. Touring A Washington Post reporter described Bearss' style as a guide as \\"Homeric monologues.\\" The Wall Street Journal wrote that he evokes \\"almost hallucinatory sensations.\\" Historian Dennis Frye said a \\"battlefield [tour] with Ed Bearss [is a] transcendental experience.\\" His speaking style is slow and imposing; spaced with overly dramatic pauses and shifts in pitch that tend to inflate the significance of what is being said, sacrificing succinctness for drama, and designed to command the listener's attention and impress them with his well-rehearsed eloquence. Bearss started interpretative touring as part of his official duties in Vicksburg, leading eight one-hour tours a day. Although he was no longer required to do so after 1958, he kept it up as an avocation on weekends. He attracted ROTC classes, active-duty military officers and VIPs, and other historians. Beginning in 1961, he began annual tours for the prestigious Chicago Civil War Roundtable. One of his greatest challenges was his annual tours of Vicksburg for the Louisiana School for the Blind and Deaf. He is a lifetime honorary member of the Cleveland Civil War Roundtable, to which he has spoken many times, beginning in 1962 and as recently as 2004. In addition, he has conducted tours for The Smithsonian Associates since 1977 for an estimated 16,000 participants. The majority of these tours focus on Civil War battlefields in the Washington, D.C. region, but have also covered other topics in American military history. Popular Smithsonian Associates tours include his retelling of the Crossings of the Upper Potomac, Battle of Antietam, Booth's Escape Route, Battle of Cold Harbor, and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign to name a few. At 90, Bearss continued to lead numerous tours --traveling as many as 200 days per year--around the United States, the Pacific, and Europe. Bearss latterly lived in Arlington County, Virginia.

The numerous and large mullioned windows are typically English Renaissance, while the loggia is Italian. Burghley House, completed in 1587 Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, England completed in 1588 for Sir Francis Willoughby by the Elizabethan architect Robert Smythson. Elizabethan architecture refers to buildings of a certain style constructed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland from 1558–1603. Historically, the era sits between the long era of dominant architectural style of religious buildings by the Catholic Church, which ended abruptly at the Dissolution of the Monasteries from c.1536, and the advent of a court culture of pan-European artistic ambition under James I (1603–25). Stylistically, Elizabethan architecture is notably pluralistic. It came at the end of insular traditions in design and construction called the Perpendicular style in church building, the fenestration, vaulting techniques and open truss designs of which often affected the detail of larger domestic buildings. However, English design had become open to the influence of early printed architectural texts (namely Vitruvius and Alberti) imported to England by members of the church as early as the 1480s. Into the 16th century, illustrated continental pattern-books introduced a wide range of architectural exemplars, fueled by the archaeology of classical Rome which inspired myriad printed designs of increasing elaboration and abstraction. As church building turned to the construction of great houses for courtiers and merchants, these novelties accompanied a nostalgia for native history as well as huge divisions in religious identity, plus the influence of continental mercantile and civic buildings. Insular traditions of construction, detail and materials never entirely disappeared. These varied influences on patrons who could favour conservatism or great originality confound attempts to neatly classify Elizabethan architecture. This era of cultural upheaval and fusions corresponds to what is often termed Mannerism and Late Cinquecento in Italy, French Renaissance architecture in France, and the Plateresque style in Spain. In contrast to her father Henry VIII, Elizabeth commissioned no new royal palaces, and very few new churches were built, but there was a great boom in building domestic houses for the well-off, largely due to the redistribution of ecclesiastical lands after the Dissolution. The most characteristic type, for the very well-off, is the showy prodigy house, using styles and decoration derived from Northern Mannerism, but with elements retaining signifies of medieval castles, such as the normally busy roof-line. History The Elizabethan era saw growing prosperity, and contemporaries remarked on the pace of secular building among the well-off. The somewhat tentative influence of Renaissance architecture is mainly seen in the great houses of courtiers, but lower down the social scale large numbers of sizeable and increasingly comfortable houses were built in developing vernacular styles by farmers and townspeople. Civic and institutional buildings were also becoming increasingly common. Renaissance architecture had achieved some influence in England during the reign of, and mainly in the palaces of, Henry VIII, who imported a number of Italian artists. Unlike Henry, Elizabeth built no new palaces, instead encouraging her courtiers to build extravagantly and house her on her summer progresses. The style they adopted was more influenced by the Northern Mannerism of the Low countries than Italy, among other features it used versions of the Dutch gable, and Flemish strapwork in geometric designs. Both of these features can be seen on the towers of Wollaton Hall and again at Montacute House. Flemish craftsmen succeeded the Italians that had influenced Tudor architecture; the original Royal Exchange in London (1566–1570) is one of the first important buildings designed by Henri de Paschen, an architect from Antwerp. However, most continental influence came from books, and there were a number of English \\"master masons\\" who were in effect architects and in great demand, so that their work is often widely spread around the country. Important examples of Elizabethan architecture include: *Audley End *Blickling Hall *Charterhouse (London) *Condover Hall (Shropshire) *Danny House *Hatfield House *Longleat House *Wollaton Hall *Rainthorpe Hall In England, the Renaissance first manifested itself mainly in the distinct form of the prodigy house, large, square, and tall houses such as Longleat House, built by courtiers who hoped to attract the queen for a ruinously expensive stay, and so advance their careers. Often these buildings have an elaborate and fanciful roofline, hinting at the evolution from medieval fortified architecture. It was also at this time that the long gallery became popular (for the Aristocracy) in English houses. This was apparently mainly used for walking in, and a growing range of parlours and withdrawing rooms supplemented the main living room for the family, the great chamber. The great hall was now mostly used by the servants, and as an impressive point of entry to the house. Surveyors (architects) active in this period *Robert Adams (1540–1595) *William Arnold (fl. 1595–1637) *Simon Basil (fl. 1590–1615) *Robert Lyminge (fl. 1607–1628) *Robert Smythson (1535–1614) *John Thorpe or Thorp (c.1565–1655?; fl.1570–1618) See also *Tudorbethan and Jacobethan, revivals derived (in part) from Elizabethan architecture ReferencesSources *Airs, Malcolm, The Buildings of Britain, A Guide and Gazetteer, Tudor and Jacobean, 1982, Barrie & Jenkins (London), *Girouard, Mark, Life in the English Country House: A Social and Architectural History 1978, Yale, Penguin etc. *Jenkins, Simon, England's Thousand Best Houses, 2003, Allen Lane, *Summerson, John, Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830, 1993 edition, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, Yale University Press, , External links *Shaw, Henry (1839).

This term is most commonly used to refer to the Soviet–American Cold War of 1947–1991. The surrogates are typically states that are satellites of the conflicting nations, i.e., nations allied to them or under their political influence. Opponents in a cold war will often provide economic or military aid, such as weapons, tactical support or military advisors, to lesser nations involved in conflicts with the opposing country.  Origins of the term  The expression \\"cold war\\" was rarely used before 1945. Some writers credit the fourteenth century Spaniard Don Juan Manuel for first using the term (in Spanish), when dealing with the conflict between Christianity and Islam as a \\"cold war\\". However he used the term \\"tepid\\" not \\"cold\\". The word \\"cold\\" first appeared in a faulty translation of his work in the 19th century. At the end of World War II, George Orwell used the term in the essay \\"You and the Atomic Bomb\\" published October 19, 1945, in the British newspaper Tribune. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war, he warned of a \\"peace that is no peace\\", which he called a permanent \\"cold war\\". Orwell directly referred to that war as the ideological confrontation between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. Moreover, in The Observer of March 10, 1946, Orwell wrote that \\"[a]fter the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire.\\"Orwell, George, The Observer, March 10, 1946 The definition which has now become fixed is of a war waged through indirect conflict. The first use of the term in this sense, to describe the post–World War II geopolitical tensions between the USSR and its satellites and the United States and its western European allies (which in practice acted as satellites of the opposing force) is attributed to Bernard Baruch, an American financier and presidential advisor. In South Carolina, on April 16, 1947, he delivered a speech (by journalist Herbert Bayard Swope) saying, \\"Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war.\\" Newspaper reporter-columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency, with the book Cold War (1947). Tensions labeled a cold war Since the U.S.–USSR Cold War (1947-1991), a number of global and regional tensions have also been called a cold war. =Second Cold War= The Second Cold War, also called Cold War II,As Cold War II Looms, Washington Courts Nationalist, Rightwing, Catholic, Xenophobic Poland, Huffington Post, 15 October 2015. Cold War 2.0, or the New Cold War refers to a renewed state of political and military tension between opposing geopolitical power blocs, with one bloc typically reported as being led by Russia or China, and the other led by the United States or NATO. This is akin to the original Cold War that saw a global confrontation between the Western Bloc led by the United States and the Eastern Bloc led by the Soviet Union, Russia's predecessor. =Middle East= An Atlantic Council member Bilal Y. Saab, an About.com writer Primoz Manfreda, an Iranian scholar Seyyed Hossein Mousavian and a Princeton University scholar Sina Toossi, journalist Kim Ghattas, Foreign Policy journalist Yochi Dreazen, Brookings Institution researcher Sultan Barakat, and Newsweek journalist Jonathan Broder use the term \\"cold war\\" to refer to tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. In February 2016, a University of Isfahan professor Ali Omidi dismissed the assumptions that the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia would grow tense. = South Asia = A commentator Ehsan Ahrari, a writer Bruce Riedel, a political commentator Sanjaya Baru and a Princeton University academic Zia Mian have used the term \\"cold war\\" since 2002 to refer to long- term tensions between India and Pakistan, which were part of the British India until its partition in 1947. =East Asia= A Naval Postgraduate School academic Edward A. Olsen, a British politician David Alton, a York University professor Hyun Ok Park, and a University of Southern California professor David C. Kang used the term to refer to tensions between North Korea and South Korea, which have been divided since the end of World War II in 1945. They interchangeably called it the \\"Korean Cold War\\". In August 2019, North Korean government said that further US–South Korean military cooperation would prompt North Korea to \\"trigger a new cold war on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.\\" Similarly, the relationship between China and the Soviet Union after the Sino-Soviet split have been termed a \\"cold war\\". China's Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng, The Diplomat editor Shannon Tiezzi, and The Guardian columnist Simon Tisdall used the term to refer to tensions between China and Japan. China's state-run tabloid Global Times says that China and Japan \\"are stuck in a state of 'cold peace' and [m]ust avoid sliding into a cold war\\". =China and India= Imran Ali Sandano of the University of Sindh, Arup K. Chatterjee of the Jindal Global Law School, journalist Bertil Lintner, writer Bruno Maçães, politician-lawyer P. Chidambaram, and some others use the terms like \\"new cold war\\" to refer to growing tensions between China and India.

Katayama expanded Nissan's focus from economy vehicles towards sportier vehicles, and is regarded by Datsun/Nissan Z Car enthusiasts as the father of the Z-Car, as well as the Datsun 510. Early years Asoh was born in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, the second of four children of a well-off businessman whose postings took the family to various places in Japan and also to Taiwan. While in Taiwan, the young Yutaka fell ill with malaria and was sent to the estate of his paternal grandfather, a wealthy landowner in Saitama Prefecture, to convalesce and attend school. He would gain his first exposure to the United States in mid-1929, while he was preparing to enter his father's alma mater of Keio University. At that time, he got a job as ship's clerk and assistant purser on the freighter London Maru, carrying a cargo of raw silk to Victoria, British Columbia and Vancouver, as well as 20 passengers to Seattle. By several reports, he spent the next four months traveling around the Pacific Northwest while the ship was being loaded with lumber for her return voyage. In 1935, he graduated from Keio University and landed a job with Nissan. In 1937, he married Masako Katayama and took her family name, as there were no sons in her family and he had two other brothers to carry on the Asoh name. Career at Nissan In 1939, during World War II, he was ordered to report to a Nissan plant in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, but managed to obtain a transfer back to Japan in 1941. Near the end of the war in 1945, he refused orders to return to Manchukuo; Katayama later credited his survival of the war to this decision. He returned to the U.S. in 1960, when Nissan sent him to do market research, after which he returned to Nissan in Japan and persuaded the company to start its own sales company in the United States. Datsun started to import the first of the Fairlady models starting with spl212 in 1960 through to the Datsun 2000 sports, the precursor to the highly successful 240z. 1968, the Datsun 510 was introduced. It cost $2,000 and carried independent rear suspension on sedans. He persuaded the Nissan corporate office in Japan to export the all new 510 with a larger 1.6 liter motor. This motor allowed the 510 to be viable on American roadways. In 1970, he introduced the Datsun 240Z, which Nissan had originally wanted to be named the Fairlady. However, his radical ideas for operations did not sit well with the executives of Nissan in Japan. Mr. K left America in 1977 for Japan and was forced into retirement. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame on October 13, 1998 for his lifetime contributions, among them the Datsun 510 and 240Z. He was inducted into the Japan Automotive Hall of Fame in 2008. A 1997 advertisement campaign for the then-introduced Nissan Frontier featured actor Dale Ishimoto portraying Katayama with a Jack Russell Terrier, stating \\"Dogs Love Trucks!\\" The campaign was further expanded to the entire Nissan line in the United States with the tagline \\"Enjoy The Ride.\\"  Personal life  His son Hiroshi was an Olympic bronze medalist in soccer in the 1968 Mexico City Summer Games. Katayama died at a hospital in Tokyo February 2015 and was survived by his wife, Masako, two sons and two daughters, 11 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.Obituary, survivorsMr. Katayama death  References  External links  *Datsun Heritage Museum *The Strange Odyssey of Yutaka Katayama: The Datsun 510 and the Rise of Japanese Cars in America at Ate Up With Motor *Yutaka Katayama (nissan-global.com) Category:1909 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Japanese automotive pioneers Category:Japanese centenarians Category:Japanese Christians Category:Nissan people Category:People from Saitama Prefecture Category:People from Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Keio University alumni ","title":"Yutaka Katayama"},{"id":"2276369","text":"General Tanaka just before his execution General Tanaka's body after the execution. was a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army, and governor of Japanese-occuped Hong Kong in World War II. His name is occasionally transliterated \\"Tanaka Hisaichi\\".Budge Biography=Early career= Tanaka was born in Hyōgo Prefecture to the Koganei family, and was later adopted into the Tanaka family, whose surname he took. He graduated from the 22nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1910 and after serving s a junior officer with the IJA 37th Infantry Regiment, he attended the Army's Toyama School and subsequently graduated from the 30th class of the Army Staff College in 1918. He served in various bureaucratic staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from 1919 to 1920, and was sent as a military attaché to the United States from 1923 to 1924. After his return to Japan, he continued to serve in various staff positions, mostly as an instructor, except for a brief stint as commander of the 1st Guards Regiment from 1935 to 1937. =As general= Tanaka was promoted to major general at the end of 1937, and briefly assigned as Chief of Staff of the Taiwan Army in 1938.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II However, with the increase in military activity in China due to the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tanaka was quickly reassigned to become chief of staff of the newly-formed Japanese Twenty-First Army from 1938 to 1939. This army was under the control of the China Expeditionary Army would later be assigned the primary role in the Canton Operation (the invasion of Guangdong Province) in southern China; however, Tanaka returned to Japan in August 1939 to serve as Commandant of the Toyama Army Infantry School, before combat operations began. In August 1940, he was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of the IJA 21st Division. As part of the Japanese 12th Army, the division participated in counter-insurgency operations in northern China as well as the Battle of South Shanxi in May 1941, and the subsequent Hundred Regiments Offensive. From November 1941, the division was transferred to the control of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and transferred to the Philippines, landing at Lingayen Gulf in February 1942 for the Philippines Campaign. Tanaka was transferred to command the IJA Twenty-Third Army in China from March 1943. This was primarily a garrison force to deter the possible landings of Allied forces in southern China. It was involved in the Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou (part of Operation Ichi-Go) from August to November 1944 and surrendered to the Chinese Kuomintang forces on August 15, 1945 with the surrender of Japan. Concurrently, from February 1945 to the end of the war, Tanaka was Governor- General of Hong Kong during the Japanese occupation. At the end of the war, Tanaka was arrested by the American occupation authorities and tried before an American military tribunal held in Shanghai in 1946 for command responsibility in the extrajudicial execution of Allied prisoners of war. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. However, he was then turned over to a Kuomintang military tribunal at Nanjing for war crimes in connection with the actions of IJA 23rd Army in China.Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia Found guilty, he was executed by shooting in 1947. He was buried in Guangzhou and his remains were repatriated back to Japan in 1972.

It was built as the head office of the Royal Insurance company. History The building was constructed between 1896 and 1903 as the head office of the Royal Insurance Company (Since 1996 part of the ″RSA Insurance Group″). The design was the result of a competition won by James F. Doyle in 1895. The assessor for the competition was Norman Shaw, who was retained as an advisory architect for the project, but it is uncertain what part he played in it. The building is constructed around a steel frame and is the earliest example of this type of construction in the United Kingdom. It ceased to be used by the late 1980s, and its condition deteriorated so much that it was placed on the Buildings at Risk Register of English Heritage. In the late 1800s it is believed that a family of 5, the “Pevsner” family, was brutally murdered on the first floor. The mystery is yet to be solved. In 2013 its freehold was bought by Liverpool City Council, and it was converted it into a hotel. It opened as the Aloft Liverpool Hotel on 29 October 2014. At the 20 years of the register, the renovation of the Royal Insurance Building was named as one of the successful rescues. Architecture Perspective drawing of the building. Constructed around a steel frame, the building is in Portland stone, with a granite basement and ground floor. Its architecture is described as \\"sumptious Neo-Baroque on the grandest scale\\". The building is in four storeys with a basement and an attic. Its long front on North John Street has eleven bays, with three bays on Dale Street. The ground floor and basement are rusticated. The windows are three-light sash windows with round heads. Those on the first floor have Gibbs surrounds and iron balconies. In the second and third floors the windows are recessed behind a Doric colonnade and entablature. In the attic are dormers. Some of these have architraves, keystones, and either segmental or triangular pediments; the others are flat- topped and contain casement windows. The entrance is on the second bay from the left in North John Street. The doorway has Doric columns and is round- headed. The first floor contains a round-headed window surrounded by a portico with a broken segmental pediment containing carved figures. Above this bay rises a three-stage campanile bearing an octagonal cupola with a gilded dome. On the Dale Street façade is a Venetian window. The second floor contains a frieze designed by C. J. Allen depicting themes relating to insurance. At the corners of this front are octagonal turrets with cupolas and finials. Between the turrets at attic level are three round-headed windows with rusticated Ionic pilasters, an entablature, and an iron balcony. The interior contains the former General Office on the ground floor which, because of the steel frame, is free from any columns. Above this, the former Board Room has a tunnel vault. Both rooms are decorated with stucco in 17th-century style. The building is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. There is an earlier Royal Insurance Building, dating from 1839, in nearby Queen Avenue, also Grade II* listed.

It promotes naturism in the United Kingdom, and it is recognised by the International Naturist Federation as the official national naturist organisation in that country.  Definition  In the British legal context: > Naturism is used to describe the activities of persons who espouse nudity as > part of their lifestyle. Whilst many naturists will restrict their > activities to specially designated areas and/or places where there is a > tradition of naked activity, such as nudist beaches, others may wish to > enjoy nudity more widely. According to the law, recognition exists for a balance to be struck between the naturist's right to freedom of expression and the right of the wider public to be protected from harassment, alarm and distress. As a member of the International Naturist Federation, British Naturism adopted the 1974 Declaration Agde that states that naturism is \\"a lifestyle in harmony with nature, expressed through social nudity, and characterised by self-respect of people with different opinions and of the environment.\\"  History  British Naturism traces its origins to 1891 when a short lived society called the \\"Fellowship for the Naked Trust\\" was formed in British India. This trust had ideals and principles very similar to many later organisations. = The Camp = The Camp was the first naturist club to be established in the United Kingdom. It was set up by someone known only as Moonella and existed at a country house near Wickford in Essex between 1924 and 1927. It was later replaced by a new venue called \\"The New Camp\\" near St. Albans. This and several others were able to form the British Sun Bathers Association in 1943. = English Gymnosophical Society = Harold Booth published articles pertaining to naturism in many magazines at the turn of the century, and in 1922 the English Gymnosophical Society (EGS) was formed as a direct result of his work. It had a site in Wickford, Essex, which it used during the summer, and in winter it held meetings in London. By 1926 the EGS was renamed the New Gymnosophy Society and had a site at Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire which has subsequently been used by many different clubs. The oldest club still in operation is Spielplatz which was founded in 1929 by Charles Macaskie and his wife Dorothy. It consists of 12 acres (4.9 ha) located in the village of Bricket Wood, in the English county of Hertfordshire.. Concurrent to this, naturism was also practiced at the Welsh Harp in Hendon, apparently from as early as 1921. From this sprang the National Sun and Air Association which ran national advertisement campaigns, as well as running a gymnasium in Westbourne Grove, London. By 1937, membership of this society was running at over 2000. = British Sun Bathers Association = In 1943 the British Sun Bathers Association (BSBA) was formed and became recognised as a national federation of clubs, which by 1951 had 51 member clubs or groups. However, by 1953, personal and ideological differences led to the formation of the rival Federation of British Sun Clubs (FBSC). = British Naturism (formerly CCBN) = Both organisations existed until their merger in 1964 to create the Central Council for British Naturism (CCBN). By 2006, CCBN was usually referred to as 'British Naturism' but officially changed the name to 'British Naturism' at the 2009 AGM. In 2009, it claimed a membership of about 13,000.  Milestones  *1957 - Naturist films shown in cinemas. *1958 - International Naturist Federation congress in Britain. *1965 - The hire of public baths for naturist swimming began. *1970 - International Naturist Federation congress in Britain. *1978 - International Naturist Federation congress in Britain, and the setting aside of officially designated naturist beaches. *2003 - Parliament repeals all offences that explicitly make nudity an offence. *2007 - Parliament repeals the enabling power for councils to make bye-laws regulating standards of clothing to be worn for bathing. *2012 - First British Naturism National Convention held at Ilam Hall Youth Hostel *2013 - Second British Naturism National Convention held at Yarnfield Park Staffordshire *2016 - Third British Naturism National Convention held at the Melville Hotel, Blackpool, from 14 to 16 October Campaigns British Naturism has sought legal and political protection against discrimination for naturists in the United Kingdom, where an opinion poll in 2008 estimated the number of people describing themselves as naturist or nudist at 3.7 million. It also runs public facing campaigns, including Women in Naturism, which encourages women to try naturist activity, Bare all for polar bears which seeks to raise money for environmental conservation and The Great British Skinny Dip, which encourages costume free swimming events to be run, not just by naturist clubs, but also public pools, spas, lidos and natural settings such as lakes. In April 2018, British Naturism announced that in discussion with the senior officer at the police college a mutually satisfactory solution was reached, and the resultant preamble and \\"decision tree\\" for dealing with complaints about public nudity has been uploaded to the Police Training manuals. Naturism is protected as a philosophical belief by the Equalities Act of 2010 and section 66 of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 does not apply to passive nudity. The Crown Prosecution Service issued guidance in 2013, and now serving police officers have advice online and in their training manual. Using nudity for \\"intentional harassment, alarm or distress\\" remains an offence under Section 4A of the Public Order Act.

The drug had been widely abused. It was initially replaced by its analogue phendimetrazine (under the brand name Prelu-2) which functions as a prodrug to phenmetrazine, but now it is rarely prescribed, due to concerns of abuse and addiction. Chemically, phenmetrazine is a substituted amphetamine with a morpholine ring.  History  Phenmetrazine was first patented in Germany in 1952 by Boehringer-Ingelheim, with some pharmacological data published in 1954. It was the result of a search by Thomä and Wick for an anorectic drug without the side-effects of amphetamine. Phenmetrazine was introduced into clinical use in 1954 in Europe.  Medical use  In clinical use, phenmetrazine produces less nervousness, hyperexcitability, euphoria and insomnia than drugs of the amphetamine family. It tends not to increase heart rate as much as other stimulants. Due to the relative lack of side effects, one study found it well tolerated in children. In a study of the effectiveness on weight loss between phenmetrazine and dextroamphetamine, phenmetrazine was found to be slightly more effective.  Pharmacology  Phenmetrazine acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine with EC50 values of 50.4 ± 5.4 nM and 131 ± 11 nM, respectively. It has negligible efficacy as a releaser of serotonin, with an EC50 value of only 7,765 ± 610 nM. After an oral dose, about 70% of the drug is excreted from the body within 24 hours. About 19% of that is excreted as the unmetabolised drug and the rest as various metabolites. In trials performed on rats, it has been found that after subcutaneous administration of phenmetrazine, both optical isomers are equally effective in reducing food intake, but in oral administration the levo isomer is more effective. In terms of central stimulation however, the dextro isomer is about 4 times as effective in both methods of administration. The salt which has been used for immediate-release formulations is phenmetrazine hydrochloride (Preludin). Sustained-release formulations were available as resin-bound, rather than soluble, salts. Both of these dosage forms share a similar bioavailability as well as time to peak onset, however, sustained-release formulations offer improved pharmacokinetics with a steady release of active ingredient which results in a lower peak concentration in blood plasma. Synthesis 1105 g. of 2-phenyl-3-methyl-4-(B-hydroxy ethyl) tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine are dissolved in 4000 cc. of anhydrous toluene. 910 g. of a-phenyl-u-ethyl acetic acid chloride are dissolved in 400 cc. of anhydrous toluene and the resulting solution is slowly added to the heated solution of the tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine compound. The mixture is then heated to boiling for about 5 hours. About 1000 g. of ice are added to the cooled reaction mixture which is then rendered alkaline by the addition of 20% sodium carbonate solution to a pH of 9.0. Thereafter the mixture is vigorously stirred by means of a turbine mixer for one hour and the toluene phase is separated. The toluene solution is washed with 1000 cc. of saturated sodium chloride solution and is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The toluene is then evaporated and the residue is subjected to high vacuum distillation. 1650 g. of a-phenyl-a-ethyl acetic acid-(Z-phenyl- 3-methyl tetrahydro-l,4-oxazine)-N-ethyl ester, boiling at 235-240 C./ 0.05 mm. are obtained thereby in a yield of 90.5% of the theoretical yield.https://www.google.com/patents/US3018222 US3018222]date=January 2015 Chemistry Its structure incorporates the backbone of amphetamine, the prototypical CNS stimulant which, like phenmetrazine, is a releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine. The molecule also loosely resembles ethcathinone, the active metabolite of popular anorectic amfepramone (diethylpropion). Unlike phenmetrazine, ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) are mostly selective as noradrenaline releasing agents.  Recreational use  Phenmetrazine has been used recreationally in many countries, including Sweden. When stimulant use first became prevalent in Sweden in the 1950s, phenmetrazine was preferred to amphetamine and methamphetamine by users. In the autobiographical novel Rush by Kim Wozencraft, intravenous phenmetrazine is described as the most euphoric and pro-sexual of the stimulants the author used. Phenmetrazine was classified as a narcotic in Sweden in 1959, and was taken completely off the market in 1965. At first the illegal demand was satisfied by smuggling from Germany, and later Spain and Italy. At first, Preludin tablets were smuggled, but soon the smugglers started bringing in raw phenmetrazine powder. Eventually amphetamine became the dominant stimulant of abuse because of its greater availability. Phenmetrazine was taken by the Beatles early in their career. Paul McCartney was one known user. McCartney's introduction to drugs started in Hamburg, Germany. The Beatles had to play for hours, and they were often given the drug (referred to as Prellies) by the maid who cleaned their housing arrangements, German customers, or by Astrid Kirchherr (whose mother bought them). McCartney would usually take one, but John Lennon would often take four or five. Hunter Davies asserted, in his 1968 biography of the band, that their use of such stimulants then was in response to their need to stay awake and keep working, rather than a simple desire for kicks. Jack Ruby said he was on phenmetrazine at the time he killed Lee Harvey Oswald. Preludin was also used recreationally in the US throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. It could be crushed up in water, heated and injected. The street name for the drug in Washington, DC was \\"Bam\\". Phenmetrazine continues to be used and abused around the world, in countries including South Korea.

Remade in its current form for King James V of Scotland in 1540, the crown is part of the Honours of Scotland, the oldest surviving set of Crown jewels in the British Isles. The crown dates from at least 1503 when, in an earlier form, it was depicted in the portrait of James IV of Scotland in the Book of Hours commissioned for his marriage to Margaret Tudor. Manufacture In January 1540, King James V commissioned the royal goldsmith, John Mosman, to refashion the Crown of Scotland. The existing crown was delicate and had been repaired at least twice in the previous 30 years, and a 1539 inventory showed further damage, including the loss of one fleur- de-lis. Mosman dismantled the old crown and removed its stones and pearls. The crown was melted down and Mosman added 41 ounces of gold mined at Crawford Moor in Lanarkshire. Constructed of solid gold, the crown consists of a base, with four fleur-de-lis alternating with four strawberry leaves. The four arches of the crown are decorated with gold and red oak leaves. At the intersection of the arches is a golden monde, painted blue with gold stars. The monde is surmounted by a large cross decorated in gold and black enamel and pearls. The crown is encrusted with 22 gemstones, including garnets and amethysts, 20 precious stones and 68 Scottish freshwater pearls. James V ordered a purple and ermine bonnet from tailor Thomas Arthur of Edinburgh to fit inside the crown. James VII ordered the colour of the bonnet be changed to red. The bonnet had to be replaced several times, and the present bonnet was made in 1993. The completed crown weighs 1.64 kg (3 lb 10 oz). Usage Royal Arms of the United Kingdom used in Scotland, with the Crown of Scotland in prime position on the helm, upon the red lion sejant affronté on the crest and upon the unicorn supporter. The crown upon the golden lion supporter is St. Edward's Crown, which has been a symbol of Royal Authority throughout the Commonwealth since 1953. The crown was first worn in the year of its manufacture by James V to the coronation at Holyrood Abbey of his second wife, Mary of Guise, as queen consort. It was subsequently used in the coronations of the child monarchs Mary I in 1543 and James VI in 1567. In the absence of a resident Scottish monarch following the Union of the Crowns in 1603, (on James VI inheriting the thrones of England and Ireland the Royal Household relocated from Edinburgh to London), the Honours were carried to sittings of the Parliament of Scotland to symbolise the sovereign's presence and the Royal Assent to legislation. The crown was used for the Scottish coronations of both Charles I in 1633 and Charles II in 1651. However, no subsequent monarchs of Scotland were crowned using this crown. During the Civil War, having already destroyed the ancient English Crown Jewels, Oliver Cromwell sought to destroy the Scottish Crown Jewels. However, the Honours were secretly buried until the monarchy was restored in 1660. Following the Act of Union of 1707, which unified the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, and having no ceremonial role to play in the proceedings of the new Parliament of Great Britain in London, the Honours were locked away in Edinburgh Castle. There they remained all but forgotten in a chest until 1818, when a group of people including Sir Walter Scott set out to find them. Since 1819 they have been on display in the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle from where they are removed only for state occasions. The first was when presented to King George IV, at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in 1822, during his visit to Scotland (the first visit to Scotland by a reigning monarch since 1651). On 24 June 1953, following her coronation at Westminster Abbey, the crown was carried before Queen Elizabeth II in a procession from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to the High Kirk of St Giles, Edinburgh, where the Honours of Scotland, including the crown, were presented to The Queen during a National Service of Thanksgiving. More recently, the crown has been present at the official opening ceremonies of sessions of the Scottish Parliament, including the first in 1999The Scottish Parliament Parliamentary News Release and the official opening of the new Scottish Parliament Building in 2004.The Scottish Parliament Media Briefing Note On such occasions the crown, carried by the Duke of Hamilton, the hereditary bearer of the Crown of Scotland, immediately precedes Her Majesty The Queen in the custom of the ancient opening ceremonial procession known as the Riding of Parliament. =Appearance in Heraldry= A scalable vector graphics rendering of the Crown of Scotland.As well as appearing in the Royal coat of arms of the UK used in Scotland and Scottish versions of the Royal Cypher, the crown appears in the version of the UK royal arms used by the Scotland Office, and also appeared in the arms used by the former Scottish Executive. =Appearance elsewhere= Stylised versions of the crown appear upon the badges of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, The Royal British Legion Scotland, the Scottish Ambulance Service, Police Scotland and, (As part of the Crest of the Royal Arms), upon the logos of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, RCAHMS, and General Register Office for Scotland. A version of the crown is used upon Royal Mail premises, vehicles and Scottish pillar, lamp and wall boxes, and a metal insert plate showing the Crown of Scotland also appears on model K6 red telephone boxes in Scotland. From 1927 until its abolition in 1975, the arms of Kincardineshire County Council featured the crown, together with the sword and sceptre, above an artist's rendering of Dunnottar Castle, to mark the county's status as the 17th century hiding place of the Honours of Scotland during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.The Coat of Arms of Kincardineshire The Crown of Scotland also appears on maritime flags, including the Blue Ensign of vessels belonging to Marine Scotland, (Compliance Division), and upon the burgees of certain Royal yacht clubs in Scotland including, for example, that of the Royal Scottish Motor Yacht Club.The Royal Scottish Motor Yacht Club From 1968 to 2008, the reverse of the Five pence coin, minted for circulation throughout the United Kingdom, featured the Royal Badge of Scotland; a thistle surmounted by the Crown of Scotland. The crown, as a component of the Royal Badge of Scotland, (A Thistle Royally Crowned), appeared on a 'Regional' series of definitive, pre-decimal Royal Mail stamps, during the period 1958 to 1970. In 2003 a new crown was made for the Lord Lyon, modelled on the Crown of Scotland. This crown has removable arches (like one of the late Queen Mother's crowns) which will be removed at coronations to avoid any hint of lèse majesté.

In music, a primary triad is one of the three triads, or three-note chords built from major or minor thirds, most important in tonal and diatonic music, as opposed to an auxiliary triad or secondary triad. Each triad found in a diatonic key corresponds to a particular diatonic function. Functional harmony tends to rely heavily on the primary triads: triads built on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant degrees.Harrison, Daniel (1994). Harmonic Function in Chromatic Music: A Renewed Dualist Theory and an Account of its Precedents, p.45. . Cited in Deborah Rifkin. \\"A Theory of Motives for Prokofiev's Music\\", p.274, Music Theory Spectrum, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Autumn, 2004), pp. 265-289. University of California Press on behalf of the Society for Music Theory The roots of these triads begin on the first, fourth, and fifth degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, otherwise symbolized: I, IV, and V (again, respectively). Primary triads, \\"express function clearly and unambiguously.\\" The other triads of the diatonic key include the supertonic, mediant, sub-mediant, and leading-tone, whose roots begin on the second, third, sixth, and seventh degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, otherwise symbolized: ii, iii, vi, and viio (again, respectively). They function as auxiliary or supportive triads to the primary triads. Diatonic functions in hierarchical order in C In C major these are: *I C *V G *IV F *VI Am *III Em *II Dm *VII Bdim In a minor key triads i and iv are minor chords, but in chord V the leading note is generally raised to form a major chord.Eric Taylor (2009). Music Theory in Practice Grade 4, p.22. . ABRSM For example, in A minor the primary triads are Am, Dm and E. Chord v (minor) in a minor key may be considered a primary triad, but its use is rare in common practice harmony. Subdominant and subdominant parallel in C major: FM (IV) and Dm (ii) chords . Auxiliary chords may be considered parallel and contrast chords derived from the primary triads. For example the supertonic, ii, is the subdominant parallel, relative of IV (in C: a d minor chord is the subdominant parallel, the subdominant is an F major chord). Being a parallel chord in a major key it is derived through raising the fifth a major second (C of F–A–C rises to D → F–A–D, an inversion of D–F–A). Alternatively, secondary triads may be considered ii, iii, and vi.Lancaster & Renfrow (2008). Alfred's Group Piano for Adults: Student Book 2, p.77. .

Steel frame is a building technique with a \\"skeleton frame\\" of vertical steel columns and horizontal -beams, constructed in a rectangular grid to support the floors, roof and walls of a building which are all attached to the frame. The development of this technique made the construction of the skyscraper possible. Concept The rolled steel \\"profile\\" or cross section of steel columns takes the shape of the letter \\"\\". The two wide flanges of a column are thicker and wider than the flanges on a beam, to better withstand compressive stress in the structure. Square and round tubular sections of steel can also be used, often filled with concrete. Steel beams are connected to the columns with bolts and threaded fasteners, and historically connected by rivets. The central \\"web\\" of the steel -beams is often wider than a column web to resist the higher bending moments that occur in beams. Wide sheets of steel deck can be used to cover the top of the steel frame as a \\"form\\" or corrugated mold, below a thick layer of concrete and steel reinforcing bars. Another popular alternative is a floor of precast concrete flooring units with some form of concrete topping. Often in office buildings, the final floor surface is provided by some form of raised flooring system with the void between the walking surface and the structural floor being used for cables and air handling ducts. The frame needs to be protected from fire because steel softens at high temperature and this can cause the building to partially collapse. In the case of the columns this is usually done by encasing it in some form of fire resistant structure such as masonry, concrete or plasterboard. The beams may be cased in concrete, plasterboard or sprayed with a coating to insulate it from the heat of the fire or it can be protected by a fire-resistant ceiling construction. Asbestos was a popular material for fireproofing steel structures up until the early 1970s, before the health risks of asbestos fibres were fully understood. The exterior \\"skin\\" of the building is anchored to the frame using a variety of construction techniques and following a huge variety of architectural styles. Bricks, stone, reinforced concrete, architectural glass, sheet metal and simply paint have been used to cover the frame to protect the steel from the weather. Cold-formed steel frames Interior partition walls made with cold-formed steel Cold-formed steel frames are also known as lightweight steel framing (LSF). Thin sheets of galvanized steel can be cold formed into steel studs for use as a structural or non-structural building material for both external and partition walls in both residential, commercial and industrial construction projects (pictured). The dimension of the room is established with a horizontal track that is anchored to the floor and ceiling to outline each room. The vertical studs are arranged in the tracks, usually spaced apart, and fastened at the top and bottom. The typical profiles used in residential construction are the C-shape stud and the U-shaped track, and a variety of other profiles. Framing members are generally produced in a thickness of 12 to 25 gauge. Heavy gauges, such as 12 and 14 gauge, are commonly used when axial loads (parallel to the length of the member) are high, such as in load-bearing construction. Medium-heavy gauges, such as 16 and 18 gauge, are commonly used when there are no axial loads but heavy lateral loads (perpendicular to the member) such as exterior wall studs that need to resist hurricane-force wind loads along coasts. Light gauges, such as 25 gauge, are commonly used where there are no axial loads and very light lateral loads such as in interior construction where the members serve as framing for demising walls between rooms. The wall finish is anchored to the two flange sides of the stud, which varies from thick, and the width of web ranges from . Rectangular sections are removed from the web to provide access for electrical wiring. Steel mills produce galvanized sheet steel, the base material for the manufacture of cold- formed steel profiles. Sheet steel is then roll-formed into the final profiles used for framing. The sheets are zinc coated (galvanized) to prevent oxidation and corrosion. Steel framing provides excellent design flexibility due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of steel, which allows it to span over long distances, and also resist wind and earthquake loads. Steel-framed walls can be designed to offer excellent thermal and acoustic properties – one of the specific considerations when building using cold-formed steel is that thermal bridging can occur across the wall system between the outside environment and interior conditioned space. Thermal bridging can be protected against by installing a layer of externally fixed insulation along the steel framing – typically referred to as a 'thermal break'. The spacing between studs is typically 16 inches on center for home exterior and interior walls depending on designed loading requirements. In office suites the spacing is on center for all walls except for elevator and staircase wells.  History  The use of steel for structural purposes was initially slow. The Bessemer process in 1855 made steel production more efficient, and cheap steels, which had high tensile and compressive strengths plus good ductility were available from about 1870, but wrought and cast iron continued to satisfy most of the demand for iron-based building products, due mainly to problems of producing steel from alkaline ores. These problems, caused principally by the presence of phosphorus, were solved by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas in 1879. It was not until 1880 that an era of construction based on reliable mild steel began. By that date the quality of steels being produced had become reasonably consistent.\\"The properties of cast iron, wrought iron and steel\\" The Home Insurance Building, completed in 1885, was the first to use skeleton frame construction, completely removing the load bearing function of its masonry cladding. In this case the iron columns are merely embedded in the walls, and their load carrying capacity appears to be secondary to the capacity of the masonry, particularly for wind loads. In the United States, the first steel framed building was the Rand McNally Building in Chicago, erected in 1890. The Royal Insurance Building in Liverpool designed by James Francis Doyle in 1895 (erected 1896–1903) was the first to use a steel frame in the United Kingdom.Jackson, Alistair, A. \\"The Development of Steel Framed Buildings in Britain 1880–1905\\", Construction History, Vol. 14 (1998)  See also  * Buckling-restrained braced frame (BRBF) * Curtain wall (architecture) * Prefabricated buildings * Steel building * Structural steel * Structural robustness ReferencesExternal links * Historical Development of Iron and Steel in Buildings * \\"Its Here - All Steel Buildings.\\" Popular Science Monthly, November 1928, p. 33\\\\. * Steel Framing Industry Association web site * Steel Framing Alliance web site * Tata Steel/BCSA/SCI information *Unic Rotarex® - Lightweight Steel Structures production Category:Construction Category:Structural steel ","title":"Steel frame"},{"id":"2276414","title":"Brian Randle"},{"id":"2276435","text":"Lost Blues and Other Songs by Palace Music is a compilation of singles, rarities, and live tracks recorded by Will Oldham under various permutations of the Palace name from 1993-1997.

The system was similar to FidoNet in purpose, but used a very different routing mechanism that was more automated and distributed. Network layout WWIVnet consisted of several participating BBSes, each referenced by a unique number called a node number. Originally, WWIVnet nodes were numbered by area code. The format was TXYZZ, where X and Y were the first and last digits of the area code, and ZZ was a number that ranged from 00 to 49 in area codes with a middle digit of 0, or a number between 50-99 in area codes with a middle digit of 1. The T portion of the node number was only used if a particular area code ran out of node numbers in their assigned range and needed more, the T would become 1. Thus, node 5802 would be a node in the 508 area code, and node 12263 would be a node in a very busy 212 area code. This numbering system worked well until the telephone systems began using area codes that used numbers other than 1 or 0 as the middle digit. When this occurred, WWIVnet realized it had to change its numbering system so a group based system was adopted, where node numbers would change to an XZZZ system. In this system, X would be the group number, and ZZZ would be the system number under that group. The network's administration was set up where every area code had an Area Coordinator (AC) which was responsible for maintaining information about the nodes in their area code. The AC reported to the Group Coordinator (GC), which was responsible for updating the node lists for the area codes under them. The GC reported to the Network Coordinator (NC), who was responsible for sending out node list updates. The NC was the person who was ultimately in charge of WWIVnet. The network structure, however, had everything to do with administration but nothing to do with the way traffic was transmitted. Simply put the only way to control the flow of data was to reduce the number of nodes on the network the system connected to. If two nodes were connected and it was the closest possible route for other nodes the traffic would follow that route. So if a node wanted to stop through traffic then they would connect to a single node for all traffic. There was no other form of traffic control on the network. Connection weight although added to the network data record was never implemented. If a specific route went down, the network would automatically try to reroute the packets in the next fastest route it could calculate. This method was an early version of peer-to-peer file sharing and may be the first instance of this type of file sharing. Note that while FidoNet was created before WWIVnet and transmitted files between systems, it did not use a peer-to-peer system because the traffic was routed using a set hierarchical model and servers (hubs/feeds) controlled all traffic. Wayne Bell referred to the networking method used by WWIVnet as a grid, similar to mesh networking, and often said he based it on Usenet.

They officially broke up on December 7, 2006, due to illness and personal conflicts in the band. Biography=Early years= The Organ were conceived in 2001 by frontwoman Katie Sketch, born Katie Ritchie, in Vancouver, BC. Sketch's musical training started at the age of three, when she began classical training on the violin. Her childhood was spent largely in ignorance of the underground sounds of The Smiths, The Cure, and Joy Division, whom The Organ would later often be favorably compared to. \\"Tiffany and Bon Jovi – that was my take on ’80s music.\\" Sketch has said of the time of the formation of the band, when she and the band members were in their early to mid-twenties. \\"I was in a musical lull, I couldn’t stand what I was listening to,\\" naming Sleater-Kinney as one example. “The local scene was also pretty shitty, and of course the radio was brutal. Then, by total fluke, my mom’s friend’s husband, Ron Obvious, hired me to help with the audio wiring for a studio he was building for Bryan Adams.” Obvious introduced Katie to the world of independent music, and what she calls \\"that ’80s sound.\\" He created mix- tapes of bands he thought she’d appreciate as a violinist (Roxy Music, Ultravox) and singers with an \\"amazing natural vocal pitch\\" (Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nina Hagen, Kate Bush)). This job also led Sketch to Tara Nelson, the engineer who would later record the Organ’s first EP. It was at this time that Katie joined with her friends Sarah \\"Sketch\\" Efron (on bass and keyboards) and Barb \\"Sketch\\" Choit (Hammond organ, guitar, bass) to form the instrumental trio Full Sketch. \\"I met Katie Sketch when we worked morning shifts at a wretched cinnamon bun shop,\\" says Efron, \\"but we really became friends on a road trip where we ended up breaking down in the redneck town of Hermiston, Oregon. On this trip, we decided to form a band and call it Full Sketch.\\" Katie, though she was already a proficient multi-instrumentalist, decided this would be a good time to try her hand at drums. \\"The concept was, 'Let's start a band where you play an instrument that you've never played before.' It was basically drunken ridiculousness, but all of a sudden I felt like life made more sense. Sarah was involved in CiTR, and Barb was big into indie rock, so what started off as a joke got me out going to see shows. The way The Organ began was as an offshoot of Full Sketch—I wanted to take the same sound and do it with singing.\\" Efron was also the news director at UBC’s CiTR, where she, Sketch and Choit co-hosted a raunchy late-night call-in program called \\"The Dead Air Show.\\" After about a year, Barb Sketch left the band to focus on her career as an artist and Full Sketch ended. According to Katie Sketch, \\"Barb Sketch is now in suburban California. She’s long forgotten her Canadian roots and lives on a ranch with her man and a team of horses.\\" At this point, organist Jenny Smyth (born Genoa Smith), replaced Choit on keyboards. Together with Efron, they founded The Organ. In 2001, a long audition process began. Eventually, Sketch \\"tired of auditions,\\" and decided to \\"just hire some people.\\" After finding a handful of like-minded musicians, Katie assigned them instruments and taught them to play. Taught is a relative term though—Debbie had been playing guitar for three years, and Sketch has expressed distaste in interviews when portrayed as a \\"music teacher\\" to the girls: \\"[The press seems] to think they had a lot of help or something, but mostly it's just the drive to be able to learn the instruments and play them,\\" Sketch said. \\"[My teaching them] was maybe a half-an-hour, hour process.\\" =Sinking Hearts EP= thumb The full formation of the band that would appear on their first EP took three years. \\"It’s not like the five of us got together and spontaneously created this,\\" Sketch once commented in an interview. \\"Jenny and I had a direction we wanted to go in and then we slowly recruited people. We could tell if someone didn’t get it, which is why we had to get rid of so many players. It’s funny, sometimes people say the band’s moving really quickly, but I feel like I’ve been doing this forever.\\" The original group eventually rounded out with Katie, Jenny, Sarah, drummer Shelby Stocks, and guitarist Debora Cohen. In summer 2002, The Organ made their debut with the release of the Sinking Hearts EP. The Canadian press and indie publications across America praised The Organ's dreampop-inflected presentation. By January, The Organ was signed to Chad Kroeger's 604 imprint and Mint Records. However, before the year was out, Efron would leave to focus on her journalism career and be replaced by Ashley Webber. \\"The rock n’ roll lifestyle wasn’t for me,\\" said Efron, who is currently working for the financial section of The National Post, a conservative Canadian newspaper. Even with the band finally complete and their first EP released, it would take years before they would release their first proper album; the process of writing and recording (the album would end up being pieced together in four different studios) would take years—two, to be exact, to finish up as Grab That Gun, an album that barely breaks a half hour in length and recycles four of its eleven tracks from Sinking Hearts. \\"We knew we had a problem when the album was being mixed,\\" comments Cohen. \\"When we heard it, we knew that it didn't sound like us. It was too, I don't know, crisp.\\" After much agonizing, the Organ decided to scrap the Dahle sessions and rerecord the album with producer Paul Forgues, who Sketch knew from her days at the Warehouse Studio. \\"It was a really, really hard choice to make,\\" Stocks says. \\"We had a window where we could have just released something that we weren't totally happy with. There was so much hype at that time, but we were like, 'No way. Let's fuck the hype and start over.' And I think that we ended up with a great album. I know that people who like us for being amateur and really simple are going to get it.\\" =Grab That Gun= Despite numerous set-backs, their five years of slow going had produced a relatively sizable fan-following, and their new material showed even more promise than their first EP, which had done very well indeed, especially for a record that had gone largely unpromoted. As such, Grab That Gun spent more time on top of the Canadian campus-radio charts than any other record released that year. That December (2004), Ashley Webber left the band. \\"I think it's the usual reasons,\\" explained Sketch in an interview. \\"I mean, I love Ashley, but we had different ideas. And then she wanted to try being in other musical projects, and we support her in that … [but our band has] got to be a high priority, I guess that's what it comes down to.\\" However, with their first international tour looming and no replacement in sight, Webber was asked back and subsequently rejoined the band in the new year. The Organ began touring heavily across Canada, the United States and Europe. They also produced a music video for \\"Brother,\\" (directed by Robert Morfitt) arguably the strongest of the seven new tracks appearing on the record. The video consisted of a fairly straightforward montage of the band performing on a moodily lit stage. A fictitious reenactment of the video shoot for \\"Brother\\" can be seen during season two, episode two of the Showtime original series The L Word. \\"Brother\\" also appears on The L Word's season two soundtrack. Following the well received promotion of \\"Brother,\\" The Organ began production on the far more ambitious \\"Memorize the City\\" video, which depicted a dizzying tour through a city of sound, light, and color. The higher artistic standard and production quality of this video reflects an amazing amount of growth for the band in a very short period, and is very impressive considering that it was shot at a time when the band was engaged in the biggest tour of their careers. That July (2005) the standalone 7\\" single, Let the Bells Ring, was released on Go Metric Records. The title track was paired with a remix of \\"Memorize the City\\" by Dustin Hawthorne. Later that year, a second remix appeared on the French CD release of Grab That Gun. During another North American tour promoting Grab That Gun, Ashley Webber left for good. She was then replaced with Katie Sketch's sister, Shmoo, who affirmed that she was \\"definitely permanent in the band\\" before it broke up in 2006. On November 14, 2005, The Organ appeared live on BBC Radio 6 Music with their new bass player. They gave a brief interview and performed live renditions of the songs \\"Nothing I Can Do\\" and \\"Love, Love, Love.\\" On the 27th, a little over a week later, The Organ announced via their website that they had just been signed to Too Pure Records, through which Grab That Gun would be available throughout the world in February 2006. The album cover was designed by David Cuesta at 7th Avenue house, and is based on a grid constructed around the Fibonacci sequence, to match musical scales. He also designed the logo based on sketches by Katie and Jenny. =Breaking Up= On 23 August 2006, the band released a statement on MySpace saying they were canceling the remaining portion of their UK tour which included dates at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reason given was illness to a band member and they assured fans the band were not splitting up. On 7 December 2006 the band released a statement on their MySpace and official site stating that they were breaking up. The statement read: :\\"We are sad to announce that we're breaking up. We want to thank our friends, fans, and family for all the support you gave to us. Thank you. :Shelby, Jenny, Katie, Debora, and Shmoo.\\" In an interview on CBC Radio 3 the following day, Jenny declined to discuss the reasons for the breakup saying that there were issues they preferred to keep private but implied that it had little or nothing to do with either geography or Katie's modeling career. \\"There were,\\" she said, \\"so many reasons,\\" she \\"wouldn't know where to start.\\" Two years later, Katie Sketch would later go on to detail the full story behind the break-up in a 2008 interview: \\"When the band ended, I was really burnt out. I thought if I took a few months off then I wouldn't be burnt out, but now, when I think about it, I wouldn't have the energy to do touring right now. I just feel absolutely exhausted with it, and band politics, and all that stuff. I am still writing music, but it's not my first priority any more. [My first priority now is] getting my life back together. We'd been touring for so long and working so hard that I didn't know how to function on a daily basis. So just little things, like, I'm going to have breakfast today, or I'm going to the gym, or I'm going to get a job. I didn't really have any concept of how to do it any more […] I spent the majority of my twenties wanting to be in a band and it's all I ever thought about. And by the time the band ended I was in really bad health. Like drinking was a problem, and not knowing how to deal with personal crises. I was in bad shape. […] If a band is really supportive of one another and can help each other through things, it works really well, but at the end we were completely unable to communicate. We'd all become self- deprecating, we were fighting all the time... we were basically just drunk all the time. We had no time to separate, so it was like being in a bad domestic situation, all the time. […] When you're five girls touring in really terrible circumstances, where you're all in the same van and all sleep in the same hotel room every night, and you're drinking a lot, you have a lot of really fun times, but there's always fighting, there's always something going on. Towards the end, where things were becoming irreparable, it got to the point where we should have been in therapy as a group. And we should have taken breaks. And I knew that, and I was pushing for that. But the way our career had gone, we released the record in Canada, then somewhere else, then somewhere else, touring the same record. It was staggered, so we were always touring where the fanbase was hearing it for the first time. We built it like that, which is how a lot of bands do it, but it was gruelling. […] We were at that point where everyone in a band wants to get, right where the financial stuff isn't going to be such a big deal, where we'd be able to tour and take personal space, but our relationships had deteriorated so much by that point. […] It's like, you're doing everything that you dreamed of your whole life, and yet you've never been more miserable. You can't get away from these people. It's like you're married to them, basically. And we had other problems as well. What I consider to be a major part of our break-up is that this whole entire time that we were touring and doing all the stuff, we were never signed in the States. And to not have a record label in the States is to not have a career. We live in Canada so it's right there, but whenever we'd play in the States it would be to nobody. So we worked really, really hard to get a label in the States and when we finally had label interest there, and a label we wanted to sign to, our Canadian record label, who own our record, wouldn't let us go with what we wanted to do. It felt like we'd been busting our asses for however long, and we felt like we had no control. So what was going to happen? We'd finally sign in the States when I was 35, and we'd do gruelling tours then? You know what I mean? That was a major knock-down for us. […] By the end, I feel like everybody in the band was mentally ill. […] Quite frankly, I was not mentally well. […] I needed to get away from it, or something really bad was going to happen. […] We really needed a break and the record label, everybody, was pushing, pushing, pushing. And there's always the feeling that you're in financial debt too. The more you do it, the more money you make, and we felt like we owed it to people. And that's how management and the record company played it - \\"you kind of owe it to us to do another tour right now. [After the breakup,] I moved to Toronto, had a mental breakdown, then I just got a job working for a doctor […] I interview people with drug problems, and alcoholics. […] Jenny the organ player just moved to Toronto and she and I bought a restaurant bar about two months ago. We're renovating it and we live above it in a teeny weeny apartment together. […] It'll be a brunch place in the day, and we have a liquor license so it will be a bar at night. [Now that Jenny and I live together,] it's constantly like, \\"Remember the time when we...\\" and we'll laugh and it's hilarious. So the whole thing wasn't horrible. It's not like I'm saying \\"don't start a band\\". I'm just saying, you've got to set your personal boundaries, as far as touring goes. As far as the grind. It's really important to take a break and we never got one.\\" =Thieves EP= Less than two years after their breakup, the band released one last EP of unreleased material titled, Thieves, on October 14, 2008. In the same October 16 interview where she would finally reveal the reasons behind the band's breakup, Katie Sketch would give insight into the motivating factors which caused the band to reunite in the studio one last time. \\"I had heard a rumor that my record label was going to release songs that we hadn't released, from some demo recording we had done earlier. I was not happy with that. At all. Threatening isn't the right word, but I heard they were thinking about releasing it. So I freaked out, and during that freak-out period I realized that I really like the songs. People have been writing us, fans, asking about the songs, so I thought we should record them while we still remember them. […] I can only speak for myself, but I found that [the recording process for the Thieves EP] was extremely emotionally draining. I made sure we did it under our own terms. I had a friend who engineered it and we did it at my mum's house in BC. She lives on this island, so it was really relaxed. And we did it in stages so the band was never there at the same time, so we couldn't fall back into the band dynamic because \\"the band\\" was never there. I gave my friend strict instructions, like, sit in the back seat and don't offer any opinion. We need it to be the easiest session ever, because people are really sensitive, and if one person says, \\"Fuck this, I'm leaving,\\" then it won't work. So we did it like that. [Having to release the EP on the same record label] is fine. I've really separated myself from the situation. But that sort of thing, being bound by a contract, straight up, that's a major obstacle in my desire to do music any more.\\" Post-breakup solo projects Since the band's breakup in 2006, several of the members have gone on to pursue solo projects. Debora Cohen released demo tracks under the name, \\"Lovers Love Haters\\", which she renamed \\"Dancer in the Dark\\", with additional single releases. Shmoo Ritchie fronted Vancouver hardcore band, \\"Keep Tidy\\". She created a project, \\"Die Cowboy Die\\", and released a 5-track eponymous album and a 7-track album, \\"All Caps\\" (2011). A video of Katie Sketch performing with a new band called \\"Mermaids\\" as early as October 31, 2007 has surfaced on the internet too. Sketch has publicly stated that she fully intends to release a solo effort, but that legal complications have thus far prevented the band from officially releasing any music. According to Sketch: \\"I feel like, OK, so I'm going to write a solo record and pour every part of myself into it, and I won't have control over where it's released in the United States again? [With regard to the possibility of releasing solo material independently,] I'm arguably bound by contract. […] It's seriously debatable and is being debated and has been for the last two years. I like to think that I'm not, and they like to think that I am. And that stress alone, honestly, keeps me from sitting down and working on music. I have no control over my own career. […] I can play live, but when it comes to releasing a record, they've straight up said to me, if you release any music you will be sued. And that kind of pressure, after all the work that I've done, really isn't like anything I need in my life right now.\\" Katie Sketch is now performing with Gentleman Reg and has been seen in some shows at the Gladstone Hotel and the Beaver in Toronto, Ontario. In 2008, along with former Organ member Jenny Smyth, Sketch opened a gay-friendly Toronto bar and hang-out, The Henhouse.Former Organ-ites open Toronto restauranthttp://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Kicking_back_at_The_Henhouse-6237.aspx As of November 2016, Katie is the guitarist of a Toronto-based all-female band, Vag Halen.

They live in the valleys, on the plateaus and slopes, and on the adjacent plains of the region. Their neighbors include the Toposa, the Boya, Ketebo, Logir, Teuth and Dongotona peoples - groups with whom the Didinga have had frequent conflicts due to economic pressures. Language and history The Didinga, Boya, Tennet, Murle and Mursi of Southwest Ethiopia share a language that distinguishes them from all other groups in the Sudan. Their language, often called the Murle-Didinga language, is also spoken by a group living in southwest Ethiopia. The Didinga claim to have lived in southwest Ethiopia two hundred years ago. During their migration to the Didinga Hills, the Didinga, Murle, Tennet and Boya were one group. They lived in harmony in Sudan until a hunting-party dispute caused the Murle to leave. Later, a famine caused the Boya to withdraw. Today, though the groups have separated, their language remains the same. Their most urban town is Chukudum, a historic town that hosted the first Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) National Convention in 1994. During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005) tensions with the Dinka people built up after the Dinka- dominated SPLA forces moved into the area in 1985. They came to a head in 1999 when the Didinga officer Peter Lorot was passed over for promotion in favor of a Dinka, assassinated his rival and took to the woods with his supporters. The fighting with Lorot's forces displaced about 16,800 people from Chukudum to nearby villages in the highlands. The \\"Chukudom Crisis\\" was resolved in August 2002 during a Peace Conference organized by the New Sudan Council of Churches. An attempt by the SPLA in June 2006 to disarm Lorot's militia was ignored, with the group threatening to start fighting again. Lifestyle For many years, the Didinga enjoyed a quiet, rural life. They took great pride in raising cattle and owned large herds that were supervised by the young single Didinga men. However, in 1963, a political disturbance which lasted until 1973 caused many Didinga to leave their cattle behind and to migrate to Uganda. While in Uganda, for the first time in their lives, Didinga were exposed to large-scale farming. Also, their children were introduced to education. These experiences created in the people the desires to make money and to gain knowledge, things which had been unimportant in the Hills. When they returned to Sudan in 1973, the people were filled with a new vision for a more advanced life. They hoped to incorporate into their own culture many of the ideas and concepts they had learned in Uganda. They were met, however, with a drastic decrease in the numbers in their herds: clansmen who had remained in the Hills had failed to restock the cattle during the disturbance. Today, many Didinga are still working to enlarge their herds. They purchase cattle either through the exchange of grain or beer, or with money. At present, farming and the desire for an education are as important to the Didinga as the herding of cattle is. The traditional values associated with raising cattle remain embedded in all Didinga. Many still take great pleasure in owning large herds. Their new-found hope for change that was brought back from their temporary migration also remains instilled in their daily lives. The Didinga use their cattle not only as a means of wealth, but also for their milk that is consumed daily and made into butter. Didinga also consume fresh blood drawn from the necks of cattle with miniature arrows. The Didinga do not fish at all, because the eating of fish is taboo in their culture. The Didinga live in scattered homesteads, with each clan grouped together. Homes are round with cone-shaped roofs. During certain seasons and during grazing periods, the Didinga also live in rustic camps. An important aspect of Didinga society is the organization of 'Nyekerehet' (age-grades) for boys. Every three to five years, boys who are around eight years old are placed together to form a new \\"age- grade.\\" These boys work and play together until they are married. Beliefs Their traditional beliefs and religious practices include having a tribal rainmaker who is entrusted with performing certain rituals to bring rain. Didinga also worship and sacrifice to spirits and gods and place great importance upon the worship of dead ancestors.

Plot summary Valancy Stirling is twenty-nine, unmarried (and thus considered an \\"old maid\\") and has lived her entire life with her nagging mother and gossip-minded extended family who actively discourage happiness and treat Valancy like a child. She retreats from her unhappy circumstances with flights of imaginative fantasy, centering on a fairy-tale Blue Castle. When Valancy is diagnosed with a terminal heart ailment, she hides it from her family and, at the same time, realizes she has never been happy in her life, so she rebels against the colorless life that her family has always imposed on her. She begins by judging them objectively and worse, telling them exactly what she thinks, causing the Stirling clan to conclude that Valancy has suddenly lost her mind. Valancy decides to move out of her mother's house and take a position as a housekeeper for a friend of hers who is now gravely ill, Cissy Gay. Cissy and Valancy had known each other as children, but Cissy became ostracized from society for having a child out of wedlock and on account of her father, Roaring Abel, and his reckless, usually drunken behavior. Cissy and Valancy share a room and rebuild their friendship. Valancy enjoys being paid a salary and spends her money in ways her family would not approve, such as purchasing a brightly colored, low- necked dress. She also begins spending time with Barney Snaith, who visits often as a friend to Roaring Abel and Cissy, but who the townspeople are convinced is a criminal and/or the father of Cissy's illegitimate child, now deceased. Just before the end of her life, Cissy confides in Valancy about the man she fell in love with. He offered to marry her when she told him she was pregnant, but she refused because she saw that he did not love her any more. Her baby compensated for her heartbreak, but when her baby died, she was devastated. Cissy eventually passes away, and Valancy's family expects her to move back home, having magnanimously decided to forgive her recent behavior. They are momentarily appeased when Valancy agrees that she is definitely not staying with Roaring Abel; however, she does not plan to move back home. Instead, she proposes to Barney, an outrageous action given the time in which she lives, telling him that she is dying and just wants to enjoy the remaining time she has left. She confesses that she has fallen in love with him but tells him that she does not expect him to feel the same. He agrees to marry her. Valancy's family is horrified that she has married such a disreputable man (even though none of them can say anything he has actually done wrong) and effectively disowns her. Barney takes Valancy to his home on a wooded island, which Valancy comes to see as being very like the Blue Castle she used to escape to in her imagination, and together they get along very well, though he forbids her to enter a certain room in the house. They share wonderful conversations and take long walks on the island, and she quotes to him from books by her favorite author, John Foster, who writes about the great beauty of nature. Foster's books were one of the few enjoyments allowed to her when Valancy lived with her family. They celebrate Christmas, and he gives her a necklace of pearl beads. Just as the year she was given to live is almost over, Valancy gets her shoe stuck in a train track and is nearly killed by an oncoming train. Barney saves her in the nick of time, risking his own life to do so. After the shock passes, Valancy realizes that she should have died because the doctor had told her any sudden shock would kill her. Barney is likewise stunned by the experience because he realizes that he has come to love Valancy, who, he believes, must soon die from her heart condition. Instead of telling Valancy how he feels, he retreats to his beloved woods to think. Valancy assumes that he has left because, having married her out of pity, he now realizes he is trapped in a marriage he doesn't want. Valancy goes back to the doctor, who realizes that he sent Valancy a letter with a diagnosis meant for a Miss Sterling, who did have a fatal heart condition; Valancy's condition was never serious. As she arrives home from the doctor, with Barney still away, she finds a gaudily dressed man waiting near their home. He introduces himself as Barney's father, Dr. Redfern, the millionaire who invented Redfern's Purple Pills and other patent medicines. Years ago, Barney left town abruptly without word to his father, who had no way of tracking him down until Barney withdrew $15,000 from his bank account to buy Valancy's necklace, alerting his father to his whereabouts. Barney's father wants him to come back to him, as Barney is the only family he has. Thinking that Barney believes she tricked him into marriage, Valancy decides to leave him and return to her mother's house so he can be free. While searching for a pencil to write Barney an explanatory note, she goes into his secret room and finds that he is also John Foster, the author of her favorite books. She writes the note and leaves behind the necklace. Valancy reveals to her family that Barney is a millionaire and the son of the famous Dr. Redfern, as well as the noted literary figure John Foster to boot. Barney's millionaire status instantly erases any misgivings her family had about him, and they are determined that Barney and Valancy must stay together. Barney rushes to the house to see Valancy and asks her to come back. At first she refuses, believing that he is only asking her out of pity. When he becomes angry at her, thinking that she is refusing him because she is ashamed of his father's patent medicine business, she realizes he does really love her and agrees to come back to him. At the ending, Barney tells Valancy how much he loves her and how badly he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. The book closes with Valancy and Barney getting ready to leave on a global trip for further adventures while her \\"own Blue Castle,\\" their home on Barney's small island, will be waiting for their return.

Plot summary In the first novel in the series, Jo, Bessie and Fanny (updated in later editions to Joe, Beth and Frannie) move to the countryside, near a large wood. One day, they go for a walk in the wood and discover an enormous tree whose branches seem to reach into the clouds. This is the Faraway Tree. When the children climb the Faraway Tree, they discover it is a very strange tree; it grows apples, pears, nuts, acorns, oak leaves and all sorts! Different magical creatures, including Moon-Face, Silky the fairy, The Saucepan Man, Dame Washalot, Mr. Watzisname and the Angry Pixie live there. They become friends with these people, in particular Moon-Face and Silky. At the very top of the tree, they discover a ladder which leads them to magical lands. The land is different on each visit, because each place moves on from the top of the tree to make way for a new land. The children are free to come and go, but they must leave before the land moves on or they will be stuck there until the land returns to the Faraway Tree. In various chapters, one of the children gets stuck in the land. The lands at the top are sometimes extremely unpleasant – for example the Land of Dame Slap, an aggressive school teacher; and sometimes fantastically enjoyable – notably the Land of Birthdays, the Land of Goodies, the Land of Take-What-You-Want and the Land of Do-As-You-Please. The first land the three children visit is the Roundabout Land, where they give some cake to two rabbits, and the rabbits dig a hole for themselves and the three children. The last land they visit in this book is the Land of Birthdays, where the brownies and the inhabitants of the Faraway Tree celebrate Bessie's birthday. Lands in the book *The Roundabout Land This land spins round and round like a roundabout, and plays music as it spins. In the land live a number of rabbits and an old man who sings along with the music while tapping his hand to the beat. The land only stops spinning once in a blue moon. *The Land of Ice and Snow The land is full of ice and snow. It has a moon and a sun in the sky at the same time. In the land live the polar bears, and the Magic Snowman used to live there before Moon- Face melted him. *The Land of the Old Saucepan Man The Saucepan Man used to live there before he went to live in the Faraway Tree. The island is surrounded by mist and has a set of saucepans as steps, leading down to the Saucepan Man's home. *The Rocking Land Is a land where you cannot take one step forward without taking ten steps back. Hills in the land go up and down and sometimes the land will tip completely sideways and you have to grab hold of a tree or roll off. It is believed that it is held by a giant who is trying to throw the land off his back. *The Land of Take-What-You-Want Is a land in which, as the name suggests, you can take whatever you want for free. *The Land of Dame Slap (Snap in later editions.) Is the land where Dame Slap has her school for naughty brownies, pixies and fairies, and results with very horrid punishments (e.g. go to bed without supper, slaps, etc.). This was later changed into Dame Snap, who shouts instead of slaps, to reduce the image of violence. *The Land of Seagulls Is a land full of seagulls. *The Land of the Red Goblins The Red Goblins used to live in the land before Wizard Mighty- One took them prisoner in the Land of Wizards. *The Land of Wizards Is home to several wizards and Wizard Mighty-One and the prisoner Red Goblins. *The Land of Birthdays Is a land you can visit only if someone has a birthday. It is land which provides party food and games for you if you have a birthday party. Bessie's one birthday is celebrated there.

The story centers on a group of young adults who become stranded on a deserted island, where they are stalked and murdered by a monstrous assailant. Plot During Labor Day weekend in 1946, young, virginal Ida Parsons innocuously plays as her father hosts a raucous party at his home on Lake Michigan. Amid the festivities, an older, drunken man named Tom Rice staggers outside and propositions Ida. When she refuses, he chases her into the woods and brutally rapes her; her dogs break out of their pen and they attack and fatally maul Ida's rapist. Thirty-six years later in 1982, Waspy brothers Eric and Nick are borrowing their father's yacht to take their girlfriends, Sandy and Donna, on a weekend outing along with their sister, Carla to St. Martin Island. At the outset of the trip. As the tensions rise between Nick and Eric, Donna and Sandy engage in girl-talk, and geeky Carla silently laments that she is the sole member of the cruise who came along without a significant other. That night, fog settles in; Eric and Nick, hearing cries out on the water, discover and rescue a shipwrecked fisherman named Bert. Bert informs them that he wrecked offshore Dog Island, the home of lumber baroness Ida Parsons, who has used her family fortune to hole herself up on the island for the past thirty-five years; only making two annual voyages onto the mainland for necessary supplies, and never speaking to anyone during these trips. Recovering from the onset of hypothermia, Bert tells the quintet a campfire story about the savagery of the wild dogs which roam Ida's island, acting as her sentries. Wrecking their boat after Nick, in a panic, attempts to steer the boat back to the mainland. Donna, Eric, Sandy, Nick, and Bert wash up on so-called \\"Dog Island;\\" Bert has been seriously wounded, and Carla is nowhere to be found. Nick wanders off into the woods, and is subsequently killed by a hulking figure that breaks down the shed where Nick hides. The next morning, Sandy and Eric go off onto the island, hoping that Ida Parsons will help them get back to the mainland. Shortly after they leave the beach, Bert goes into shock, and Donna desperately tries to warm him. Seconds later, the same figure which killed Nick sneaks up behind Donna and Bert, fatally hurling Donna against a rock wall and decapitating Bert. At the center of the island, Sandy and Eric discover Ida's fortified cabin, as well as the fact that all of Ida's dogs have died long ago, their mutilated skeletons lying in their pens. In Ida's boathouse, the duo discover Carla alive hiding under a tarp; she apparently washed up at another point on the beach and made it to the compound in the middle of the night. In the course of exploring Ida's compound, Eric, Sandy and Carla discover a dust-covered nursery full of antique toys, and a cobweb-covered crib; they also discover Ida Parson's diary, which contains insane, rambling passages about giving birth to a sick child, which she intends to keep sinless by secluding him from all the evils of the outside world. As they continue exploring the house, Sandy comes across Ida's skeletal corpse in repose in her bedroom. The group decides to collect supplies and head back to the shore to collect the rest of their party so they can formulate an escape from the island in Ida's old rowboat. While exploring the basement, they discover the corpses of Nick and Donna and flee to the beach in a panic. Eric and Sandy deduce that Ida Parson's 35-year-old mutant son was the one behind the murders, left insane by his life of solitude under the care of the imbalanced Ida; with nothing to do but learn from Ida and explore the wilderness, he's become immensely strong, a capable tracker and hunter, and is thoroughly convinced that all outsiders are a threat to him and his mother. With the death of Ida, he was left without any basis for reality, and ended up eating the dogs to survive. Eric and Sandy go back to the house and get the matches that Sandy dropped earlier. Ida's son attacks, breaking down the door. Eric attempts to fight using a broken branch, but the mutant grapples with him and fatally breaks Eric's back; and chases Sandy upstairs into his mother's bedroom, where she wraps a blanket around her head and, playing Ida, convinces the mutant to leave his mother's bedroom. When Sandy leaves, the mutant pursues her to the boathouse, where she runs headlong into Carla. The mutant grabs Carla and crushes her face and kills her. Sandy manages to lure the man into Ida's boathouse, which she sets on fire; although severely burned in the blaze, he still manages to attack Sandy, chasing her up a hill where she yanks a sharp signpost from the ground and impales him. As he dies, his burned, deformed face is finally seen. Traumatized by the death of her friends and the killing she has been forced to commit, Sandy sits alone on Ida's dock, strongly resembling a scarred and traumatized Ida.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half out of a possible four stars, calling the film \\"slow- moving\\", and criticizing the film's overuse of cliches, lack of visibility, and lack of clear shots of the monster. AllMovie's review of the film was negative, calling it a \\"plodding horror bore\\" and commenting, \\"whatever interest this deathly dull flick may have mustered is completely obscured by some of the murkiest cinematography on record; the fact that nearly every scene is shrouded in complete darkness may prove a blessing in disguise.\\" Tim Brayton from Antagony & Ecstasy gave the film a negative review calling the film \\"Junk\\" and criticized the film's characterization as being \\"of limited interest\\" but complimented the film's unique villain and being better acted than most slasher films. Justin Kerswell from Hysteria Lives! awarded the film 2.5/5 stars, writing, \\"HUMONGOUS seems to desperately want to be a hefty helping of true American Gothic, but in reality it's far too cheesy to be very macabre or even generate many true thrills.\\" Contemporary Over the years, contemporary reviews have been more positive of the film. For the film's 35th Anniversary, Dave J. Wilson from Dread Central wrote a retrospective on the film, noting its similarities with Joe D'Amato's 1980 film Antropophagus, which Wilson felt \\"undeservedly achieved cult status\\". In his retrospective, Wilson stated that, while the film was no classic, it didn't deserve the obscurity and abysmal reviews that it was given. Wilson concluded his assessment by writing, \\"Under-seen and unfairly maligned, there is not much to dislike about Humongous... aside from Nick and Donna. Atmospheric, brutal, sleazy, suspenseful and tense, a monstrous villain, and an energetic finale, this is an entertaining little slasher flick.\\" Todd Martin from HorrorNews.net called the film \\"great little flick that has gone somewhat unnoticed for way too long\\". In his review, Martin commended the film's premise, death scenes, soundtrack, and suspense; while criticizing the poor lighting of some scenes. Kurt Dahlke from DVD Talk wrote in his review of the film, \\"Though derivative of other Slasher Movies, plagued by the annoying improbabilities of all A-to-B horror efforts, filled with bickering dorks, and pretty slow to get started, Humongous eventually gets to a weird, frenetic payoff\\". Tom Becker from DVD Verdict also gave the film a positive review. In his review on the film Becker commented, \\"While it might not be the shocker it should be, Humongous is a pretty entertaining bit of horror fluff from the days when people took this stuff seriously\\". Jack Sommersby from eFilmCritic.com awarded the film a score of 3/4 stating, \\"It's perfect for audiences looking for an undemanding, scary good time, along with those longing to see the drop-dead gorgeous Janet Julian in a skimpy bikini\\". Although, reception from critics have remained negative. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 0% based on six reviews. =Home Media= Humongous made its debut on DVD on Nov 15, 2011 where it was released by Scorpion Releasing. It has also been released on Blu-ray by Scorpion Releasing.

The illegal end must result from performance of the contract itself. The classic example of such an agreement is a contract for murder. The illegality of a contract depends on (1) the law of the country governing the contract, and (2) the law of the place of performance. Different rules will apply depending on the law of the relevant country(ies). However, a contract that requires only legal performance on the part of each party, such as the sale of packs of cards to a known gambler, where gambling is illegal, will nonetheless be enforceable. A contract directly linked to the gambling act itself, such as paying off gambling debts (see proximate cause), however, will not meet the legal standards of enforceability. Therefore, an employment contract between a blackjack dealer and a speakeasy manager, is an example of an illegal agreement and the employee has no valid claim to his anticipated wages if gambling is illegal under that jurisdiction. In Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises (1988),Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises, 201 Cal. App. 3d 832, 247 Cal. Rptr. 340 (1988). the California Court of Appeal for the Third District refused to enforce a contract for payment of promissory notes used for the purchase of a company that manufactured drug paraphernalia. Although the items sold were not actually illegal, the court refused to enforce the contract for public policy concerns. In Canada, one cited case of lack of enforceability based on illegality is Royal Bank of Canada v. Newell, 147 D.L.R (4th) 268 (N.S.C.A.), in which a woman forged her husband's signature on 40 cheques, totalling over $58,000. To protect her from prosecution, her husband signed a letter of intent prepared by the bank in which he agreed to assume \\"all liability and responsibility\\" for the forged cheques. However, the agreement was unenforceable, and was struck down by the courts, because of its essential goal, which was to \\"stifle a criminal prosecution\\". Because of the contract's illegality, and as a result voided status, the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband. Contracts in restraint of trade are a variety of illegal contracts and generally will not be enforced unless they are reasonable in the interests of the contracting parties and the public. Contracts in restraint of trade if proved to be reasonable can be enforced. When restraint is placed on an ex-employee, the court will consider the geographical limits, what the employee knows and the extent of the duration. Restraint imposed on a vendor of business must be reasonable and is binding if there is a genuine seal of goodwill. Under common law, contracts to fix prices are legal. Sole supplier (\\"solus\\") agreements are legal if reasonable. Contracts which contravene public policy are void.

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case decided on June 12, 1992, in which the court held that a group of American wildlife conservation and other environmental organizations lacked standing to challenge regulations jointly issued by the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, regarding the geographic area to which a particular section of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied. The case arose over issues of US funding of development projects in Aswan, Egypt and Mahaweli, Sri Lanka that could harm endangered species in the affected areas. The government declared that the act did not apply to projects outside of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife sued. Said Lily Henning of the Legal Times: :In [this] decision, hailed by the right and attacked by the left as well as by a broad swath of legal scholars, the Court made clear that plaintiffs must suffer a concrete, discernible injury--not a \\"conjectural or hypothetical one\\"--to be able to bring suit in federal court. It, in effect, made it more difficult for plaintiffs to challenge the actions of a government agency when the actions don't directly affect them. Writing for the plurality, Justice Scalia stated that Defenders had failed to satisfy Constitutional requirements for “injury in fact” that would grant standing under the Endangered Species Act. He wrote that the Court rejected the view that the citizen suit provision of the statute conferred upon “all persons an abstract, self-contained, non-instrumental ‘right’ to have the Executive observe the procedures required by law.\\" Rather, he explained, an American citizen plaintiff must have suffered a tangible and particular harm. Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice David Souter asserted in their concurring opinion that an airline ticket to the affected geographic areas with endangered species in question would have been enough to satisfy the imminent threat of future injury requirement.

They were shaped about the size of an American half dollar coin and came in five flavors: banana, green apple, watermelon, orange, and strawberry. Sold in a clear plastic wrapper, you could see the long strip of multi-colored and flavored wacky wafers inside. Later, they were produced in a smaller version similar to the current bottle caps in a box filled with the miniature fruit-flavored snacks. Wacky Wafers were discontinued as part of the regular product line when Nestlé purchased the Willy Wonka brand, but they were reintroduced in 2017 by Leaf Brands, LLC. The original candy company for Wacky Wafers (& Bottle caps) was Breaker Confections in Itasca Illinois, a far west suburb of Chicago. Breaker confection licensed the \\"Willy Wonka\\" name so it could be used as a merchandising tie-in for the movie. In 1980, Breaker Confections changed its name to Willy Wonka Brands.

Motivation The victims all hailed from the Higholborn Street and Gold Street areas of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) stronghold of South Side community in downtown Kingston. They were identified as being too closely linked to the opposition JLP and were singled out as being prime targets for assassination by members of the leading Peoples National Party (then headed by the now deceased Michael Manley). The Military Intelligence Unit (M.I.U) was required by government members to take \\"all reasonable steps\\" to ensure removal either overtly or covertly of anyone who was deemed to be a threat to the island's security and to the smooth running of the PNP government. The massacre The operation was executed by undercover agents of the Military Intelligence Unit going into the Southside Community and infiltrating the Southside's' \\"POW Posse\\" which was a local gang operating in the area led by the now assassinated Franklyn Allen aka \\"Chubby Dread\\". There were fourteen men in this gang who were originally targeted for assassination. The men were promised jobs as drivers and bodyguards.Campbell, Howard (2018) \\"Glenroy Richards: the singer who died at Green Bay\\", Jamaica Observer, 14 January 2018. Retrieved 17 January 2018 The men, needing the arms and funding, agreed; and in the early hours of 5 January 1978 an army ambulance driven by an MIU operative and a minivan picked them up at the intersection of Higholborn Street and Port Royal Street, then headed west towards Port Henderson, Saint Catherine where the Green Bay artillery range is located. On arrival at the Military Base, the men were led out to a section of the range where they were given strict instructions not to move as they would be picked up by other persons who would take care of their work requirements and supply them with arms to be transported into Kingston.. As soon as the MIU operatives drove off, a specially selected team of snipers from the JDF, led by Major Ian Robinson was lying in ambush in the nearby hills. The soldiers were armed with L8 General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG), L2A2 Self Loading Rifles and Sterling Sub-Machine Guns with Browning 9mm pistols as sidearms. On the receipt of a pre-arranged signal from one of the MIU operatives which was the firing of a single shot from his Browning 9mm pistol into the upper torso of Winston Hamilton aka \\"Saddle Head\\", the sniper team opened fire on the group of men from their nest in the hills. Five men fell dead under the hail of gunfire that erupted and the remainder fled into nearby bushes. At least one member, (Delroy Griffiths) entered the bay and was rescued by a passing fishing boat. Those killed were all Labourites from South Side: * Norman Thompson aka \\"Gutto\\", a former national footballer for SANTOS football team * Glenroy Richards, an aspiring reggae singer * Trevor Clarke * Winston Hamilton aka \\"Saddle Head\\" * Martin Hamilton. Aftermath The official report released by the Military was that the men were shot dead after they were surprised by a special Strike Force of soldiers doing target practice with guns smuggled into the country on the Jamaica Defence Force artillery firing range at Green Bay. This report did not stick, as the people of South Side demonstrated to protest against the killings. An official inquiry and Coroners' Inquest was later held in the Spanish Town Coroner's Court where a jury found that persons had conspired to kill the men at Green Bay and that people in the JDF were criminally responsible for the massacre. The overwhelming evidence was that the men were lured to Green Bay and ambushed by soldiers led by Major Ian Robinson and Captain Karl Marsh. In July 1978 warrants were issued by the Supreme Court for ten members of the JDF for First Degree Capital Murder and Conspiracy to Commit Murder. These included Major Ian Robinson, Captain Karl Marsh, Lieutenants Suzanne Haik, and Frederick Frazer, Sergeant LaFlamme Schooler, Privates Desmond Grant, Errol Grant, Everald King, Colin Reid and Joel Stainrod. Those charged for the conspiracy were all acquitted in June and July 1981 on no case submissions and those charged for the actual murders were acquitted on February 8, 1982 due to insufficient evidence. The Jamaica Labour Party refused the verdict but could do nothing to bring the perpetrators to justice as they were already acquitted by the Courts. The Michael Manley led PNP has always disavowed knowledge of the covert action that took the lives of the men and said it was purely a military operation that was later justified. The incident is considered one of the worst acts of brutality in Jamaican history.

In the United States, such a building may also be called a student union, student commons, or union. The term \\"student union\\" refers most often in the United States to a building, while in other nations a \\"students' union\\" is the student government. Nevertheless, the Association of College Unions International (largely US-based) has several hundred campus organizational members in the US; there is no sharp dichotomy in interpretation of union in this context. The US usage in reference to a location is simply a shortened form of student union building. History The first student union in America was Houston Hall, at the University of Pennsylvania, which opened January 2, 1896Building America's First University: An Historical and Architectural Guide to the University of Pennsylvania George E. Thomas, David Bruce Brownlee, p3 and remains in operation to this day. The first Ohio Union at Ohio State University was Enarson Hall. The building opened in 1911 and was the first student union to be built at a state university and the fourth of its kind in the United States. Oklahoma State University's student union opened in 1950. Subsequent additions, and renovations in 2010, have made the building one of the largest student activity centers in the world at .ANSTHE , Oklahoma State University, retrieved April 23, 2006 Some student centers carry unique origins and historical significance with some on the National Register of Historic Places. The William Pitt Union was originally constructed in 1898 as a hotel and was converted into a student center in 1956.http://www.williampittunion.pitt.edu/index.html Some student activity centers on the NRHP include O'Hara Student Center (University of Pittsburgh), McKenny Hall (Eastern Michigan University), and the Tivoli Student Union. The Tivoli Student Union was originally home to the Trevoli Brewing Company but since has been converted to serve several institutions in Denver, Colorado. $20 Million Makeover For Denver's Historic Tivoli's Student Union In 2007, the University of Vermont's student center became the first LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.

File:Houston Hall, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.jpgThe first student activity center in America was Houston Hall at the University of Pennsylvania File:Schenley Hotel.jpgThe William Pitt Union as the Schenley Hotel File:OSUStudentUnion2.jpgStudent Union at Oklahoma State University Purpose Broadly speaking, the facility is devoted to student recreation and socialization. A student center or student union is the community center of the college, serving students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests. A student activity center might offer a variety of programs, activities, services, and facilities. It may contain lounges, wellness centers, dining facilities or vendors, and entertainment venues. The student center is often the center of student affairs and activities and may house the offices of the student government or other student groups. It may also act as a small conference center, with its meeting rooms rented out to student groups and local organizations holding conferences or competitions. An example of this for instance is the Michigan Union, which hosts the University of Michigan Model United Nations conference. Depending on the school and its location it might have unique amenities such as a bowling alley, cultural or prayer rooms and unique services. At Eastern Michigan University Student Center the building offers a kiva, a round, 360-degree room patterned after spaces used in Native American cultures. The Kiva Room at EMU is used as a meeting space, for collaboration, or for musical purposes. In the Ohio State University-Ohio Union, the student union offers an interfaith prayer room which has feet washing area for Muslim students. The University of Central Florida has an eyewear and optometric consumer service location.

He was also the host of well-known evangelical syndicated radio programs that were broadcast throughout the United States for several decades. Springer was in actuality neither a doctor nor a minister, and he described himself as the \\"last of the old-time medicine men.\\" In 1969, the American Medical Association labeled him the \\"King of Quacks\\". In the early 1970s, the federal government discovered that Springer held no legal rights to the land where Zzyzx stood; consequently, he was evicted from the space and briefly imprisoned. Biography= Personal life = Curtis Howe Springer was born December 2, 1896, and hailed from Birmingham, Alabama. He was married to Mary Louise Berkebile. They separated at some point, and he married a woman named Helen.US Court Record: \\"Rehearing Denied March 5, 1973 .\\" – Helen Springer is listed as Curtis' wife. Springer had several children, including a daughter, Marilou, and a son, Curtis Jr., who later became a judge in Montgomery, Alabama. = Early career = He claimed to have been a private in the United States Army, where he taught boxing. In Springer's early life, he \\"drummed up crowds for William Jennings Bryan's tirades against demon rum\\" and was a sheet music vendor at Billy Sunday's evangelical services. Following World War I, Springer worked at a school in Florida. In the late 1920s, Springer moved to Chicago, where he became involved with an automotive technical school called Greer College. Springer was fired by 1930, and the school was forced into bankruptcy shortly afterward. Throughout the 1930s, Curtis Springer gave lectures throughout the midwestern United States, claiming to either to be the \\"Dean of Greer College\\", or that he represented/attended the fictional institutions of the National Academy, The Springer School of Humanism, the American College of Doctors and Surgeons, the Westlake West Virginia College, and two non-existent osteopathy schools in Meyersdale, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Although all his lectures were \\"free\\", Springer would ask for donations part-way through his speech, and often attempt to sell audience members private courses in psychoanalysis for $25 per session. In advertisements for his appearances, he would often follow his name with M.D., N.D., D.O. or Ph.D. Chicago was largely Springer's home base until the summer of 1934. After he applied for airtime on WGN radio, the station contacted American Medical Association's Bureau of Investigations for information regarding Springer. The AMA and Better Business Bureau quickly began to take note of his completely falsified education record. Before long, Springer had been labeled as a notorious fraud and doctor-impersonator by the medical community. An extensive article in the September 14, 1936 edition of Journal of the American Medical Association titled \\"Curtis Howe Springer: A Quack and His Nostrums\\" detailed his exploits and lack of education. The book concluded that \\"a most thorough search fails to show that Springer was ever graduated by any reputable college or university, medical or otherwise.\\" =Radio career= Although denied airtime on WGN, he was successful in obtaining a twice-daily slot as a radio evangelist on Chicago's WCFL. He began broadcasting on the station in 1934. His programs were often an outlet for his support of Franklin Roosevelt and The New Deal. In addition, he would often use the radio show to sell his \\"medicines\\", including the antacid Re-Hib (confirmed by the American Medical Association to be mostly baking soda) and Antediluvian Tea (\\"a crude mixture of laxative herbs\\"). Around 1935, Springer left Chicago and began preaching on KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. = Health spas and Zzyzx = Springer's wife Mary encouraged him to try to launch a health spa and in 1931, he launched a resort called Haven of Rest in Fort Hill, Pennsylvania. Only six years after it first opened, he lost Haven of Rest due to non-payment of taxes. He attempted to set up other resorts and gatherings in Wilkes-Barre, Johnstown, and Mount Davis in Pennsylvania; Cumberland, Maryland; and Davenport, Iowa. Remains of Springer's spa at Zzyzx, California. In 1944, Springer and his new fiancée Helen filed a mining claim on federal land to 12,800 acres (51.8 km2) in California's Mojave Desert, claiming a tract about 8 miles (13 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide. The land contained the remains of an 1860 Army post and a railroad station on the defunct Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad. He named the settlement Zzyzx as a gimmick to ensure that it would be \\"the last word\\" in health. Zzyzx's original encampment consisted of 20 tents, and he recruited homeless men from Los Angeles' Skid Row to build simple concrete buildings. Springer created an imitation hot springs – which he attempted to pass off as genuine – by using a boiler to heat several pools. In time, Springer erected a sixty-room hotel, a church, a cross-shaped health spa with mineral baths, a radio broadcast studio, a private airstrip dubbed \\"Zyport\\" and several other buildings which included a castle. The \\"Boulevard of Dreams\\" was a divided parkway leading to an oasis on Lake Tuendae, later identified as the habitat of the endangered Mohave chub. While building his retreat, he spent half the week in Los Angeles, still recording his radio program, and rounding up workers to build his new resort by offering room and board at Zzyzx in exchange for labor. Administrative building and chapel built by Springer at Zzyzx, California. Now the Desert Studies Center headquarters. From Zzyzx, Springer continued his syndicated radio program, at one point carried by 221 stations in the United States and 102 more abroad, mixing religious music and his own radio evangelism. Along with this came his requests that listeners send him \\"donations\\" to get his special cures for everything from hair loss to cancer. The potions were actually little more than a blend of celery, carrot and parsley juices. The Zzyzx Springs experience itself included goat milk; allegedly life-prolonging \\"Antedeluvian Tea\\"; a $25, self-administered hemorrhoid cure; more solicitations for \\"donations\\"; and a twice-daily sermon over the loudspeakers. = Legal challenges and imprisonment = By the late 1960s, Springer had begun marking off lots on the land and allowing \\"donors\\" of large sums of money to his ministry to build homes on the lots. This caught the attention of federal officials. While Springer had posted mining claims in the area, under the General Mining Law of 1872, it was still public land until such time that he validated the claims for patent by proving to federal government geologists that the claim contained minerals that could be extracted at a profit. The federal government took Springer to court claiming he was squatting on federal land. In 1974, he was found guilty of the charge. He offered to pay $34,187 in back rent on the land to the Bureau of Land Management, but the government refused the payment and evicted him and his few hundred local followers. Springer was also convicted for making false claims that the health foods he sold would cure everything \\"from sore toes to cancer.\\" He was represented in court by criminal attorney Gladys Towles Root. In the trial, Springer was convicted of false advertising. He filed several appeals on this conviction, and two years later ended up serving 49 days of a 60-day sentence. Following the eviction, in 1976, the Bureau of Land Management allowed the California State University to manage the facilities and land in and around Zzyzx. A consortium of colleges combined funds and resources to convert the former resort into a research station called the Desert Studies Center; schools contributing to the center included California State Universities at Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pomona and Northridge. After his release from prison, Springer and his wife relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he spent the remainder of his life.  Death  Curtis Springer died in Las Vegas on August 19, 1985, at the age of 88. He was buried in the Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.interment.net Two publications, the journal Word Ways and the book Weird California, have incorrectly reported Springer's year of death as 1986.

History The SCPA first appeared in Superboy (volume 1) #131 (July 1966). Several of the dogs were given alliterative names which also described their powers: i.e. Paws Pooch was able to increase its number of limbs, Prophetic Pup could predict the future using his \\"crystal ball cranium\\", Tail Terrier had an elastic tail, etc. The team was something of a parody of the Legion of Super-Heroes, with enemies such as the \\"Phanty Cats\\". Their battle cry and sacred oath, with which they began all meetings, was :Big dog, big dog, bow, wow, wow! :We'll stop evil, now, now, now! The first line parodies the Yale chorus: \\"Bulldog, bulldog, bow-wow-wow\\". They are presumed to have been wiped out of existence after the Crisis on Infinite Earths. They have appeared once in a superhero limbo in Grant Morrison's Animal Man \\"Monkey Puzzles\\", where characters that have been written out of continuity reside. While visiting here, Merryman of Inferior Five stated to Animal Man that even if some of these characters may be brought back, times have changed where the Space Canine Patrol Agents (as some of the other animals) will not likely return.Movie Poop Shoot's look at Animal Man However Krypto's status as the El family dog from Krypton has been restored and The Sandman: Overture issue #3 included a cameo appearance of the \\"Space Canine Patrol Corps\\". Membership The Space Canine Patrol Agents roster has included: *Tail Terrier: Has an elastic tail that can be used as a rope. \\"Top Dog\\" of the SCPA. *Mammoth Mutt: Can inflate to many times his size. Died in his first appearance. *Hot Dog: Pyrokinetic *Tusky Husky: Can turn one of his canine teeth into a long tusk, which is used as a lever. *Bull Dog: Can grow horns. *Paw Pooch: Can grow additional limbs. *Chameleon Collie: Shapeshifter *Prophetic Pup: Clairvoyant *Krypto: Similar powers to Superman. *Mammoth Miss: Mammoth Mutt's girlfriend, with the same powers. *Beam Beagle: Possessed \\"searchlight eyes\\". Died in the line of duty. It was never confirmed which of them is the leader. In other media A version of the team appears in the 2000s Krypto the Superdog animated series under the name the Dog Star Patrol. Their battle cry resembles the Space Canine Patrol Agents, but goes: :Dog Stars, Dog Stars, bow, wow, wow! :Bark for justice, now, now, now! This version includes: *Tail Terrier: He can use his tail as a lasso. He speaks with a Southern accent. *Mammoth Mutt: She can inflate herself like a balloon. A female version, based on Mammoth Miss. *Hot Dog: He can breathe fire. His powers are triggered by his anger. In the episode \\"Bones of Contention\\" he started to control his anger. *Tusky Husky: He has a long tooth used as a drill. He speaks with a French-Canadian accent. *Bull Dog: He can grow bull horns out of his head. He speaks with a Cockney British accent. *Paw Pooch: He can grow multiple limbs. *Krypto: His powers are similar to Superman's. *Drooly: An original character, he has the power of super-drooling, able to create streams of saliva, using it as projectiles or rope. He only appeared in one episode: His powers were considered unimpressive at first, but after he saved the team, he was made a reserve member. *Stretch-o-Mutt: Stretch-o-Mutt was originally a guard-dog for a Star-Labs chemical storage facility. When chasing his ball he fell into a vat of an unknown chemical, but was quickly rescued by Krypto. It was later found that his DNA was merged with the elasticity of his ball giving him the ability to contort his body in to whatever he desired. He later saved the Dog Star Patrol from Mechanikat and became a reserve member. *The team is led by Brainy Barker (an original character similar to Marvel Comics' Professor X, she may be loosely based on Prophetic Pup). She possesses powerful psychic abilities, and rides on a pillow instead of walking. *Streaky the Supercat (despite being a cat) and Ace the Bat-Hound were also made members later in the series. Note: The original seven Dog Stars (Brainy Barker, Tail Terrier, Mammoth Mutt, Hot Dog, Tusky Husky, Bull Dog, and Paw Pooch) are never seen as a group of seven on the show. Instead the Dog Stars seem to be on a rotation, usually Brainy Barker and five or fewer of the other dogs.

It was opened on Monday 9 June 1856. It was the responsibility of the Toxteth Park Burial Board, which had been established by at least 1855. The opening ceremony was performed by the then Lord Bishop of Chester, and the first interment took place, that of an Elizabeth Watling on 17 June 1856. The cemetery was built with consecrated and unconsecrated areas, and the layout, featuring walks, was by a \\"Mr Gay of Bradford cemetery\\". It was taken over by Liverpool Corporation on 1 January 1905. Records The cemetery's records are held on microfilm in the Liverpool Record Office, and provide the Burial Registers and the Order Books. Structures The cemetery is itself Grade II listed and incorporates a derelict chapel, a derelict mason's yard and a pair of lodges or gatehouses at the Smithdown Road entrance. A significant number of obelisk and Celtic cross gravestones are also listed. The cemetery also contains Toxteth War Memorial. To the rear, the cemetery bounds the back gardens of houses on Arundel Avenue, and can be accessed through turnstiles in an ornate gateway set back from that road at the end of a short lane. On the easterly lodge at the main entrance at Smithdown Road there is a sign with provision for the insertion of digits indicating the time of evening at which these rear entrance turnstiles will be closed, but for some time this sign has been disused, as this lodge also appears to be (the westerly lodge being inhabited and, as of spring 2009, up for auction.)

John Hulley's grave John Hulley's grave as found in February 2008 John Hulley's grave in June 2009 after renovation Buried in the cemetery (Grave G493) is John Hulley, founder of the Liverpool Gymansium and the National Olympian Association, who died in 1873. Revival of interest in his role in Olympic history was initiated by an article (2001) in the Journal of Olympic History entitled \\"The Mystery of John Hulley\\". Subsequently, his grave was rediscovered in 2008; it was badly damaged in that the headstone had been removed from the main covering stones and the grave was in a very bad condition from 130 years of atmospheric pollution. A Memorial Fund was set up to raise money for the restoration of Hulley's grave and increase awareness of his part in the founding of the British Olympic movement. This took several months but thanks to generous donations from the International Olympic Committee, the British Olympic Association, and members of the public, sufficient funds were raised to engage a stonemason. Messrs Welsbys of Liverpool renovated the grave and brought it back to its original condition and a re-dedication ceremony was held in 2009. Neighbours At the eastern end of the high southern boundary wall, where the cemetery ends and the grounds of a supermarket, a medical clinic, and modern houses begin, the high wall continues but the style of brickwork can be seen to change; this area now occupied by the aforementioned modern buildings was previously the Toxteth Park Workhouse, which was built in 1859 by the Toxteth Park Board of Guardians as part of the West Derby Union. In 1923 the workhouse changed its name to the Smithdown Road Institution; in 1930 the Poor Law was abolished and the Union was disbanded, so the hospital was taken over by Liverpool Corporation. In 1933, its name was changed to Smithdown Road Infirmary, and in about 1950 its name was changed again, to Sefton General Hospital. Most of it was demolished in 2001 but a part of the original workhouse hospital, Arundel House, still stands.The National Trust — E.

Overview The Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) philosophy recognizes autism as a lifelong condition and does not aim to cure but to respond to autism as a culture. Core tenets of the TEACCH philosophy include an understanding of the effects of autism on individuals; use of assessment to assist program design around individual strengths, skills, interests and needs; enabling the individual to be as independent as possible; working in collaboration with parents and families.Philosophy and Overview. TEACCH, University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Retrieved September 15, 2012. =Strategies= The emphasis on individualization means that TEACCH does not distinguish between people with very high skill levels and those with learning disabilities. Strategies used are designed to address the difficulties faced by all people with autism, and be adaptable to whatever style and degree of support is required. TEACCH methodology is rooted in behavior therapy, more recently combining cognitive elements, guided by theories suggesting that behavior typical of people with autism results from underlying problems in perception and understanding. The strategies put forward by TEACCH do not work on the behavior directly, but on its underlying reasons, such as lack of understanding of what the person is expected to do or what will happen to them next, and sensory under- or over-stimulation. By addressing communication deficits, the person will be supported to express their needs and feelings by means other than challenging behavior. Working from the premise that people with autism are predominantly visual learners, intervention strategies are based around physical and visual structure, schedules, work systems and task organization. Individualized systems aim to address difficulties with communication, organisation, generalisation, concepts, sensory processing, change and relating to others. Whereas some interventions focus on addressing areas of weakness, the TEACCH approach works with existing strengths and emerging skill areas. =International recognition= Most of the literature is of North American origin. The adoption of the TEACCH approach has been slower elsewhere. In 1993, Jones et al. stated that there was insufficient use of the TEACCH approach in the UK to include it in their study of interventions. In 2003 it was reported that Gary B. Mesibov and Eric Schopler describe TEACCH as the United Kingdom's most common intervention used with children with autism. In Europe and the United States it is also a common intervention.Fletcher-Campbell, Felicity.

A 2013 meta-analysis indicated that TEACCH has small or no effects on perceptual, motor, verbal, cognitive, and motor functioning, communication skills, and activities of daily living. There were positive effects in social and maladaptive behavior, but these results required further replication due to the methodological limitations of the pool of studies analyzed. History The TEACCH approach was developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, originating in a child research project begun in 1964 by Eric Schopler and Robert Reichler. The results of this pilot study indicated that the children involved made good progress, and consequently state finance supported the formation of Division TEACCH. Founded in 1971 by Eric Schopler, TEACCH provides training and services geared to helping autistic children and their families cope with the condition.Schopler to be honored with APF lifetime achievement award.

Myers) is an American experimental filmmaker based in northeast Ohio. He holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree (1959) and a Master of Arts degree (1961), both from Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. Myers taught at Kent State University in the art department beginning in 1964 and is particularly known for his 1970 film Confrontation at Kent State, which he filmed in Kent during the week following the Kent State shootings of May 4, 1970; it is an important document of the period. Myers began to produce independent films in the early 1960s. Many of his films are highly personal, with non-narrative or loose narrative structures derived from his dreams. Although some films (as, for example, his 1993 film Tarp) feature no actors at all, instead focusing entirely on inanimate objects, most films feature nonprofessional actors and are produced on very small budgets. Myers is the recipient of two (due to a name spelling error) Guggenheim Fellowships as well as grants from the American Film Institute and the National Endowment for the Arts. The Academy Film Archive preserved several of Richard Myers' films, including Akran, The Path, and Allison Beth Krause.

Flores (born September 21, 1975), better known by his stage name Lil Rob, is an American rapper, producer, and actor. Biography Flores was born in San Diego and raised in La Colonia de Eden Gardens, a Mexican American neighborhood in Solana Beach, California. In the early 1990s, he began performing under the name Lil Rob & the Brown Crowd, and recorded a single titled \\"Oh, What a Night in the 619\\". Though it did not chart, it was later featured on his 1997 debut album Crazy Life, with the title shortened to \\"Oh, What a Night\\". In 1994, his chin was shattered when he was shot in the jaw and in the eye later. During his career, Lil Rob has collaborated with fellow Chicano rappers Mr. Shadow, Mr. Sancho, and OG Spanish Fly, and mainstream artists such as Paul Wall, The Game, E-40 and Pitbull. Lil Rob and Mr. Shadow were in a group called The Mayhem Click. The numbers twelve and eighteen, which are tattooed on his forearms, represent the numeric value of the letters L and R, the initials of his stage name. The number was used during his days as a graffiti tagger. In 2002, Lil Rob left Low Profile Records and signed to Upstairs Records. He found commercial success with the 2005 release Twelve Eighteen (Part I) in which the single \\"Summer Nights\\" received national airplay, a first in his career. \\"Summer Nights\\" peaked at #36 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #13 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The follow-up single, \\"Bring Out the Freak in You\\", peaked at #85 on the Hot 100 Charts, and at #20 on the Hot Rap Tracks. The exposure led to small roles in the 2005 Cuba Gooding, Jr. film Dirty and the 2007 Rob Schneider vehicle Big Stan, both of which were released straight to DVD in the U.S. On June 29, 2007, Lil Rob made his very first appearance overseas in Okinawa, Japan. 1218 (Part II) was released in 2008 and featured the single \\"Let Me Come Back\\" featuring Fingazz. In 2009, Love & Hate, was released, and in 2013, he released a new song called \\"Don't Want to Fall in Love\\". In 2014, his ninth album, R.I.P. (Recording In Progress), was released. Feuds Lil Rob was in conflict with Mr. Shadow, Royal T (CEO of Low Profile Records), and Mister D (CEO of Southland Records). Mr. Shadow would malign Lil Rob on hit singles, \\"Shadow of Your Death\\", \\"Excited\\" and \\"Excited 2\\". These songs were from the album Till I Die. One of the reasons why Mr. Shadow had problems with Lil Rob was because Mr. Shadow claimed that Lil Rob was not from San Diego. Mr. Shadow claimed that he was from Solana Beach. Mr. Shadow felt that Lil Rob was lying to everyone about being raised in San Diego, CA. In 2005, on the Twelve Eighteen (Part I) album, Lil Rob also disses his own cousin in the song \\"I Who Have Nothing\\". Lil Rob feuded with Royal T, and eventually left his label, on account of marketing issues. Royal T, the executive producer of Low Profile Records, had created a scam that involved Lil Rob's albums to have the same bar code as Royal T's CDs, which resulted in Royal T automatically receiving the profits. According to Lil Rob's manager, Lil Rob sold over $1 million worth of his own CDs and didn't receive a dime. As soon as Lil Rob left Low Profile, Lil Rob recorded a diss aimed towards Low Profile, entitled \\"The Last Laff\\" on The Last Laff EP. Low Profile Records responded with a track entitled \\"Riders\\", featuring Royal T, Payaso (Dukes Click), Lil' Bandit & Mr. Sancho. Lil Rob recorded another diss track entitled \\"Call the Cops\\", directed at Royal T on 2002's The Album. Lil Rob also recorded diss tracks \\"Bluffin'\\", dissing directly at Royal T and \\"Boo Hoo Hoo\\" dissing both Royal T and Mr. Shadow off of 2004's Neighborhood Music. Collaborations Lil Rob has collaborated with musicians such as Mr. Shadow, Lil Cuete, Royal T, Mr. Lil One, Mr. Sancho, OG Spanish Fly, Silencer, Fingazz, Kid Frost, Frankie J, J. Cole, Ludacris, Pitbull, N.O.R.E, Chingo Bling, Bizzy Bone, Far East Movement, Baby Bash, The Game, Eric Bellinger, Ice Cube, WC, Dyablo, NB Ridaz, SPM, Fat Joe, Paul Wall, Flo Rida, Voltio and C-Kan.

It has long been known that a kingdom by this name is mentioned as existing during the collapse of the Kingdom of Makuria in the thirteenth century. It was reported to be one of the last surviving Christian states in the region. History Scholars believed it was one of a number of small successor states to emerge during this anarchic period. However, the large collection of documents found at Qasr Ibrim in the 1960s overturned this view. The Qasr Ibrim find contains many documents relating to relations between the Eparch of Nobatia and the King of Dotawo. These include relations during Makuria's peak in the 12th century. The Eparch even seems to have had far more dealings with the king of Dotawo than his overlord the king of Makuria. One explanation for this is that Dotawo is simply another name for Makuria. The depiction of multiple kings clashes with the description of the region given by Arab traveler Ibn Selim el-Aswani. In no known document are the names of both Dotawo and Makuria present, and at several points the listed names of the king of Dotawo matches those of Makuria. However at many other points in time the name of the King of Dotawo being written to does not match that of the King of Makuria. The name also seems to indicate a Kingdom based at Gebel Adda, also known as Daw. One Arab writer reports that the Beja region was structured with thirteen lesser kings under one \\"Great King,\\" and Dotawo could have been one of these vassal kingdoms.

His most influential publication was his two-volume book Chemistry, Theoretical, Practical and Analytical as applied and relating to the Arts and Manufactures (1857-1860). Life James Sheridan Muspratt was born in Dublin and moved to Liverpool with his parents when he was one year old. His father, James Muspratt, was one of the biggest industrial chemicals manufacturers in the UK between 1825 and 1850. James Sheridan Muspratt attended private schools in Bootle, Merseyside, and then went with tutors to travel on the European continent. Beginning in 1836, he studied chemistry under Thomas Graham at Anderson's University in Glasgow and then moved with Graham to University College London. In 1841, his father sent him to Philadelphia to manage the Muspratt business interests there but these were unsuccessful. Muspratt's father had met and become friends with Justus von Liebig at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and James Sheridan was sent to work with von Liebig at the University of Giessen in Germany where he gained a PhD in 1845. James Sheridan Muspratt's own cited original research work includes a report on the sulphites (1845) and, with August Wilhelm von Hofmann, on the preparation of toluidine and nitraniline (1845-1846). In 1848, Muspratt founded the Liverpool College of Chemistry in a disused stable at the back of his house in Canning Street, Liverpool. Upon his father's retirement in 1857, he became a partner along with his brothers in his father's chemicals manufacturing business. But it was also in the late 1850s that he wrote the textbook Chemistry, Theoretical, Practical and Analytical as applied and relating to the Arts and Manufactures. The German translation of this book by Friedrich Stohmann was widely read in Germany, which was the leading nation in the field at the time. Muspratt also published translation into English of some German-language chemistry. Family Muspratt took an interest in theatre and helped to organise a visit to Liverpool of Charles Dickens's amateur company in 1847. Among the cast were the American actress Susan Webb Cushman. Muspratt married Susan in 1848 and they had three daughters. Susan died in 1859 and Muspratt remarried, to Ann Neal of Rainhill the following year. They had no children and Muspratt died at his home in West Derby, Liverpool in 1871.

He was known for bringing large numbers of journalists into the profession. The New York Times wrote in 1995, \\"Few journalists have left a more enduring imprint on late 20th-century journalism—an imprint that was unabashedly mimicked even as it was being mocked—than Clay Felker.\\" Birth and education He was born in 1925 in Webster Groves, Missouri, the son of Carl Felker, an editor of The Sporting News, and his wife, the former Cora Tyree, the former women's editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Both of Clay's parents along with a grandfather and a grandmother graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism. He had one sibling, Charlotte. Felker's grandfather, Henry Clay Felker, of German aristocratic origins, fled Germany after the 1848 Conservative takeover. The family surname was originally von Fredrikstein. Felker attended Duke University, where he first became interested in journalism and edited the student newspaper, The Duke Chronicle. He left school in 1943 to join the Navy, but returned to the school to graduate in 1951. In 1983, he founded the Editorial Board for the alumni publication Duke Magazine. Duke awarded Felker an honorary degree in 1998, as well as the Futrell Award for Excellence in Communications and Journalism. Duke Magazine created the staff position of Clay Felker Fellow for \\"an aspiring journalist with unusual promise.\\" Career After graduation, Felker worked as a sportswriter for Life Magazine. He turned an article he wrote about Casey Stengel into a 1961 book, Casey Stengel's Secret. He was on the development team for Sports Illustrated and was features editor for Esquire. He later worked for TIME. Felker gave Gloria Steinem what she later called her first \\"serious assignment,\\" regarding contraception; he didn't like her first draft and had her re-write the article. Her resulting 1962 article about the way in which women are forced to choose between a career and marriage preceded Betty Friedan's book The Feminine Mystique by one year. She joined the founding staff of Felker's New York and became politically active in the feminist movement. Felker funded the first issue of Ms. Magazine. After losing a battle for Esquire editorship to Harold Hayes, Felker left to join The New York Herald Tribune in 1962. He revamped a Sunday section into New York and hired writers such as Tom Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin; the section became the \\"hottest Sunday read in town.\\" A long-time friend of Tom Wolfe, Felker was one of the early proponents of New Journalism and key to its emergence. The New York Herald Tribune closed its doors in 1966 and Felker later, in 1968, reconstituted the Sunday section as New York Magazine. After founding New York Magazine in 1968, one of his first features was Wolfe's coverage of Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, a story Wolfe later expanded into his non-fiction novel The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. New York became one of the most imitated magazines of its time, both from a design perspective and in the way it combined service and life-style articles. \\"He had the crass but revolutionary (revolutionary in the sense that it overthrew generations of class conceits) notion that you are what you buy. He sniffed the great consumer revolution with its social, political, and aesthetic implications. And New York Magazine became the first magazine to spell out where to get the goods (and at the best price),\\" wrote Michael Wolff about Felker in New York's 35th Anniversary issue.\\"35 Years\\", April 7, 2003. Felker became editor-in- chief and publisher of The Village Voice in 1974 and resigned from New York following its hostile takeover by Rupert Murdoch in 1976. He then bought Esquire in 1977 but sold it in 1979. Felker also, in 1988, bought the lower Manhattan paper Downtown Express, but sold it in 1991.\\"Three decades of covering what’s up Downtown\\", March 31, 2017. In 1987 he became editor of the business magazine Manhattan, inc., staying on as editor when it was sold and merged with the lifestyle magazine M into M, inc. Spy magazine portrayed Felker as out of touch with his former milieu and in charge of a series of money-losing journalistic enterprises. In 1994, Felker became a lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, teaching a course called \\"How to Make a Magazine\\" at the Felker Magazine Center, named in his honor and of which he became director. Felker's stylish but detached role as the founder and editor of New York magazine led some observers to compare him with another American mid-Westerner who went east—albeit a fictional one, Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby.Morrison, Colin. Start Spreading the News: \\"New York\\" Fights Back. Flashes & Flames (blog). Marriages Felker was married three times: *Leslie Blatt, a fellow Duke undergraduate, in 1949; they later divorced and she subsequently married John W. Aldridge, a literary critic, and later Charles Westoff, a Princeton University professor. She died November 9, 2014, in Palm Beach, Florida. *Pamela Tiffin, an actress and fashion model, whom he married in 1962 and divorced in 1969. *Gail Sheehy, the writer, in 1984.

Death He died on July 1, 2008 in Manhattan from what his wife, Gail Sheehy, described as \\"natural causes\\", following a long battle with throat cancer. Tributes Tom Wolfe said: “He ranks with Henry Luce of Time, Harold Ross of the New Yorker and Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone in that these are all people that brought out magazines that had a new take on life in America.” The current editor-in-chief of New York, Adam Moss, wrote after Felker's death: “American journalism would not be what it is today without Clay Felker.

The stadium is primarily used for baseball and is the home field of the Auburn Doubledays minor league baseball team. The Auburn Maroons high school baseball team also plays its home games at the stadium. The current, rebuilt facility opened in 1995 and holds 2,800 people. As of 2004, the venue's full name is Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park. Background Falcon Park (2012) Falcon Park was originally built in 1927 on the same site which currently houses the 1995 reconstructed facility. The stadium is called Falcon Park because it was built by a fraternal organization in Auburn called the Polish Falcons. The Polish Falcons owned the stadium until 1959, when the local minor league franchise purchased it. The City of Auburn purchased both the stadium and the franchise in 1981 by assuming the former team's unpaid debts. Falcon Park was a typical old wooden grandstand-type facility from 1927 until 1995. The original park's demolition began seconds after the final out of the final game of the 1994 season, with a bulldozer crashing into the stadium by smashing through the center field fence. The scene was shown nationally on ESPN. Permanent lights were first erected at Falcon Park in 1940, although some temporary construction lights were put in place in order to accommodate some night baseball in 1938. Before the stability of the present Auburn Doubledays franchise, professional minor league baseball was somewhat of a \\"come and go\\" proposition in Auburn. When the city had no team in 1957, the stadium was used as an auto racing speedway for children. The kids raced go-kart-type vehicles called microds on a one- tenth mile oval built on the ball diamond's infield. The races drew large crowds and the enterprise was featured in an article in Life Magazine. When the city had no team in 1981, the stadium was used for rock and roll concerts. A few games were staged here in May and June 1969 by the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League while their home field MacArthur Stadium was being repaired after a fire. Teams All of Auburn Community Baseball's entries in the New York-Penn League have played their home games at Falcon Park. Auburn's NY-P League team has operated under the following names: *Auburn Yankees (1958–1961) *Auburn Mets (1962–1966) *Auburn Twins (1967–1971) *Auburn Phillies (1972–1977) *Auburn Sunsets (1978) *Auburn Red Stars (1979) *Auburn Americans (1980) *Auburn Astros (1982–1995) *Auburn Doubledays (1996–present) Notable players Notable Major League Baseball players who played for Auburn in Falcon Park include: *Ken Boswell *Jim Bouton *Ike Delock *Rick Dempsey *Morgan Ensberg *Luis Gonzalez *John Halama *Aaron Hill *Cleon Jones *Todd Jones *Jerry Koosman *Ed Kranepool *Phil Linz *Kenny Lofton *Tug McGraw *Roy Oswalt *Joe Pepitone *Shane Reynolds *Johan Santana *Rollie Sheldon *Lonnie Smith *John Stephenson *Mel Stottlemyre *Billy Wagner Leo Pinckney Field At the end of the 2004 NY-P season, the playing field at Falcon Park was named Leo Pinckney Field in honor of Auburn resident Leo Pinckney, who was instrumental in securing Auburn's New York-Penn league franchise in 1958. Pinckney was a former president of Auburn Community Baseball and a former president of the New York–Penn League, whose Pinckney Division is also named in Pinckney's honor. As a result, the full name of the facility is now Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park, although it is still mostly known by its original, shorter name.

Dwyer Stadium opened in 1996 replacing the original stadium that was built in 1937, while the playing field is the original. The stadium is currently home to the Batavia Muckdogs, the Class-A short season affiliate of the Miami Marlins; the Genesee Community College Cougars of the NJCAA; and high school teams including the Notre Dame of Batavia Fighting Irish and Batavia Blue Devils. History The grandstand and surrounding structure of Dwyer Stadium may be new but the field and area hold over 80 years of professional baseball history. Originally built in 1939 the stadium underwent three names and stood until 1995 when being replaced by the new stadium, keeping the previous name. =State Street Park (1939-WWII)= State Street Park was built in 1939 and employed 17 local workers to construct. During the first season of play the stadium went unfinished and a snow fence had to be placed for each game to act as the outfield wall while chairs had to be borrowed from a local mortuary for seating. The works project continued through the first season but did not deter fans as 3,000, still a record for Batavia, attended the first game of professional baseball at State Street Park. =MacArthur Stadium (WWII-1972)= During World War II the name was changed to MacArthur Stadium after General Douglas MacArthur in an act of patriotism. =Dwyer Stadium (Original - 1973-1995)= Before the 1973 season the stadium found its final name, Dwyer Stadium, after Edward D. Dwyer, a long time team president that was instrumental in keeping the team in Batavia. The stadium was a wooden and covered grandstand that was famous in old time ballparks. =Dwyer Stadium (1996–present)= In 1995, it was officially announced Batavia would be getting a new $3 million stadium on the same location; the field would remain intact while the grandstand and seating would be torn down and replaced. Auburn and Batavia each got a stadium that was almost carbon copies of one another. The old Dwyer Stadium still has its place in the new stadium as the original Wall of Fame is still present behind the first base bleachers. Usage Dwyer Stadium is primarily used for baseball, though has also been home to area youth football as well throughout its history. Dwyer is the home field of the Batavia Muckdogs minor league baseball team, Short-Season Class-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins and also hosts college games during the spring and fall for the Genesee Community College Cougars as well as local high school games in the spring. =Empire State Yankees= During the 2012 season the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Yankees, the Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees, were scheduled to play seven games at Dwyer Stadium as the Yankees home stadium PNC Field in Moosic, Pennsylvania underwent renovations. Before the scheduled games the New York Yankees made improvements to the infield and pitchers mound as well as the clubhouse. Due to weather conditions only four Triple-A games were played at Dwyer.

On May 17, 2010, she became the 21st person and the first woman to climb all of the fourteen eight-thousander peaks in the World.ExWeb Oh Eun-Sun report, final: Edurne Pasaban takes the throne, ExplorersWeb, Dec 10, 2010 Her first 8,000 peak had been achieved 9 years earlier, on May 23, 2001, when she climbed to the summit of Mount Everest.  Life and career  Pasaban was born in Tolosa, in the province of Gipuzkoa in the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain. She summited her ninth eight- thousander, Broad Peak, on July 12, 2007, together with the Austrian climber Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner. On May 1, 2008, Pasaban summited Dhaulagiri, as did Kaltenbrunner the same day again. Both downplayed the aspect of a race between them for the first woman to climb all 14 eight-thousanders. On May 18, 2009, Pasaban climbed the Kangchenjunga with, among others, Juanito Oiarzabal and the Polish climber Kinga Baranowska. With that she exceeded Kaltenbrunner and Nives Meroi and she became the first woman to climb twelve eight- thousanders.Top-5 women to reach more eight-thousanders, with dates Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner equaled her two days later when summited Lhotse. Nives Meroi, an Italian climber, then tried to achieve the summit in the Kangchenjunga, but was forced to abandon the climb when her husband and fellow climber, Romano Benet, began suffering health problems during the ascent. On April 17, 2010, she added Annapurna to her record, and proceeded directly thereafter to climb Shishapangma, where she completed her quest on May 17. On April 27, 2010, it was announced that Pasaban might have lost out on becoming the first woman to climb all 14 8,000 meter peaks to Korean climber Oh Eun-sun. However, Pasaban and other experts disputed Oh's summit of Kangchenjunga.Spanish TV, Photo of Oh Eun-Sun at Kangchenjunga, which has created serious doubts Following a conversation between Elizabeth Hawley and Pasaban, Hawley announced that Oh's summit would be marked as \\"disputed\\" in future editions of her Himalayan database. On May 3, Oh had an hour long discussion with Hawley in Kathmandu, in which she asked Oh about the details of her Kangchenjunga climb.Sophia Tamot (AFP) \\"S.Korean climber defends claim to 14-peak record\\" May 3, 2010 Retrieved on 2010-05-12. \\"Oh will be credited for her climb to Kangchenjunga but the ascent will be marked as disputed,\\" Hawley later told the press. \\"Her account was completely different from Pasaban's so I really don't know who is right,\\" she added. Hawley reportedly said the Kangchenjunga entry will be switched back to \\"successful\\" if the Spanish team withdraws its allegations.Chosun Daily \\"Mountaineer Oh Eun-sun Meets Arbiter of Himalaya Ascents\\" May 4, 2010 Retrieved on 2010-05-15. Rejecting Pasaban's claims, Oh added, \\"I believe that according to Pasaban, some Sherpas told her that I hadn't climbed Kangchenjunga. But no names of the Sherpas have been mentioned. Why?\\" On May 4, 2010 Pasaban mentioned the names of the seven Sherpas involved: \\"Dawa Ongchu Sherpa, Pema Chiring Sherpa, Chheji Nurbu Sherpa, Dawa Sangge Sherpa, Ong Darchi Sherpa, Cuombi Sherpa and Phurdorchi Sherpa.\\"Pasaban da los nombres de los sherpas que dicen que Miss Oh no hizo cumbre She declined to give these names earlier as these Sherpas were still working for the Korean climber. Later Pasaban conceded that she was the second woman to climb the 14 highest peaks, but questioned whether the Korean climber had actually conquered them all.\\"Spanish climber concedes she is second woman to climb world's 14 highest peaks\\", Telegraph.co.uk 23 May 2010 Retrieved on 27 May 2010 However, on August 29, 2010, it was announced that the South Korean Hiking Federation, after examining the proofs presented by Oh, had refused to acknowledge her Kangchenjunga ascent, accepting the sherpas' version according to which Oh was not able to complete the ascent due to bad weather conditions. Oh later admitted that she had to stop a few hundred meters below the Kangchenjunga summit, and therefore the mountaineering site ExplorersWeb considered on December 10, 2010 that Edurne Pasaban is the first woman that has climbed all fourteen peaks. This would settle down the polemic in favour of Pasaban. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner and Nives Meroi are the two other female climbers who have summited all 8,000 meter peaks.

Diethrick, Jr. Park is a stadium in Jamestown, New York. It opened in 1941 and holds 3,000 people. Primarily used for baseball, Diethrick Park was home to teams in the New York–Penn League, a short season minor league baseball league, from its opening until 2014. It is also home to the Jamestown Community College baseball team as well as Jamestown High School's baseball team. It also has hosted multiple Babe Ruth League World Series, most recently the 2018 16-18 Year-Old World Series . History Built in 1941, Jamestown Municipal Stadium was, at time of the NY-Penn League's departure, the second oldest ballpark in the league; the park replaced a park in Celoron that the NYPL had used in its first two seasons. The stadium is owned by the City of Jamestown. It hosted the Jamestown Falcons of the \\"Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League \\" (PONY League), which is now known as the NY-Penn League. The park was later unofficially known as \\"College Stadium\\" after Jamestown Community College relocated its campus right behind the park on Falconer Street in 1961. On August 9, 1997, the park was renamed Russell E. Diethrick, Jr. Park in honor of Jamestown's \\"Mr. Baseball.\\" It was dedicated to Mr. Diethrick, who has been player, manager, owner, supporter and friend of professional and youth baseball in Jamestown longer than most can remember. Mr. Diethrick is currently the Community Development Officer for Jamestown Savings Bank. He has been an important member of the voluntary Jamestown Jammers Executive Advisory Board. Mr. Diethrick also serves as the Host President of the Jamestown Babe Ruth World Series Committee and a member of the National Board of Directors for Babe Ruth, Inc. The stadium has undergone numerous renovations in order to modernize. In 2006, a brand new scoreboard and sound system were installed and in 2010 the current press box was renovated. The Jamestown Jammers took up residence in the city in 1994, immediately after the Montreal Expos moved the city's original NYPL team to Vermont. After 21 consecutive seasons, the NYPL moved the Jammers to Morgantown, West Virginia at the end of the 2014 season, leaving the city without professional baseball. The amateur Prospect League, a collegiate summer baseball league, took up residence in the ballpark in 2015; that team was also known as the Jamestown Jammers. The Jammers were replaced by a team in the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League the next year, which played another three seasons before the team's owners abruptly shut the team down and left town in October 2018. A replacement team in the PGCBL, originally intended to keep the Jammers name and history, abruptly decided to rename the team the Jamestown Tarp Skunks (after an inside joke in the Jammers organization) prior to the start of the 2020 season. In 1990, College Stadium was the site of a memorable large-scale stunt by the TV series Candid Camera, in which a catcher for the then-tenant Jamestown Expos was put up to calling pitches with nothing but incomprehensible signs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNmXWPxcg_E Diethrick Park is almost exclusively used for baseball; other venues in Jamestown are better suited for other sports (Strider Field hosts football, and Northwest Arena handles concerts, ice hockey and other indoor events).

Formed in 1717 as Dragoner-Regiment Nr.5 Bayreuth Dragoner it was originally a dragoon regiment and was part of the Prussian order of battle until 1918. The Bayreuth Dragoons achieved fame for their role in winning the Battle of Hohenfriedberg in 1745. In 1819 it was transformed into a cuirassier regiment. Apart from short interruptions, the regimental garrison was Pasewalk in Western Pomerania from 1721 to 1919. History=Pre-Napoleonic= Dragoons of Dragoner-Regiment Nr. 5 depicted by Richard Knötel The Prussian Dragoner-Regiment Nr. 5 was formed by a royal order on 2 April 1717. The new formation was to be sponsored by Oberst Achaz von der Schulenburg and raised from recruits in the Duchies of Ansbach and Bayreuth. by 1 June the regiment was formed, with 44 officers and NCOs and 295 cavalry troopers, all aged between 20 and 40 years old. By 1718, the regiment had expanded to four squadrons comprising 689 men. It was not until 1730 that the regiment reached its full size, ten squadrons, a total of 62 officers, 120 NCOS, standard bearers, 30 drummers and 1,320 cavalry troopers. On 7 August 1731 the regiment was granted the honor title Bayreuth Dragoner (Bayreuth Dragoons) and was redesignated Dragoner-Regiment Nr. 5 Bayreuth Dragoner. The regiment wore the standard powder blue coat of the Prussian dragoons with crimson turnbacks and facings. The regiment first saw action during the War of Austrian Succession. At the Battle of Mollwitz, six squadrons of the regiment were engaged on an attack on the Austrian's left wing. This attack caused the enemy to retreat and brought victory for the Prussian king, Frederick the Great. At the Battle of Chotusitz, the regiment did not fare as well. During two cavalry attacks, the Bayreuth Dragoons failed to break through the enemy lines and suffered heavy losses including 14 officers, and three standards. The regiment won its reputation at the Battle of Hohenfriedberg. The Austrian commander, Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, was holding against repeated Prussian infantry attacks. The commander of the Bayreuth Dragoons, Generalleutnant Gessler, saw an opportunity to attack a large force of Austrian infantry attacking the exhausted Prussian infantry. The ten squadrons of the regiment formed into two columns and charged into the Austrians. In the fighting that followed, the Bayreuth Dragoons destroyed 20 Austrian and Saxon battalions, took 2,500 prisoners, and captured 67 regimental standards, losing only 6 officers and 28 men killed. Prinz Karl was forced to retreat in disarray, and the battle was won. After the charge at Hohenfriedberg, the regiment was permitted to wear a golden 67 on their cartridge cases. They also received a diploma from Frederick the Great, naming all officers who took part in the charge and praising the regiment, as well as granting them their own regimental march, the Hohenfriedberger Marsch, composed by Frederick himself. Although the regiment was present at the Battle of Soor, it did not see any action, arriving just before the Austrian defeat. With the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756, the regiment was in the vanguard of the Prussian advance into Saxony. At the Battle of Lobositz, the regiment was involved in the two failed cavalry charges against the Austrians on the Homolka-berg. The regiment performed as well as could be expected, with two squadrons rescuing the Gardes du Corps from annihilation. The dragoons participated in the Siege of Pirna, and on 6 May 1757 took part in the bitterly fought Battle of Prague. In the French Revolutionary Wars the regiment marched southwest in 1792 to fight in northern France in the Palatinate and Baden. In the battle of Jena-Auerstedt against Napoleon it was almost routed. =Coalition wars and onwards= In 1806, Queen consort Louise of Prussia became Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment. Subsequently it was renamed to Königin-Dragoner (The Queen's Dragoons) per royal order on 5 March 1806. After the death of the Queen a royal order from 4 August 1810 declared that the regiment should forever bear the name \\"Regiment of the Queen\\" (Regiment der Königin). Thus it was called Regiment Königin- Dragoner until 5 November 1816. On 6 November 1816 it was renamed to 1. Dragoner Regiment (Königin) (1st Dragoon Regiment (Queen)). From 28 May 1819 on it was restructured into a cuirassier regiment and was then called 2. Kürassier Regiment Königin. Its final name was awarded on 4 June 1860, Kürassier Regiment \\"Königin\\" (Pommersches) Nr. 2 (Cuirassier Regiment \\"Queen\\" (Pomeranian) No. 2). In the War of the Sixth Coalition, the Queen's Dragoons fought in the battle of Ligny, the battle of Waterloo and at Meaux in 1815/1816. The regiment was mobilised in the Second Schleswig War and went to war but did not see considerable action. In the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, the cuirassiers took part in the battle of Königgrätz amongst others. During the Franco-Prussian war, the regiment fought at Colombey on 14 August and at Gravelotte on 18 August 1870.

LeLacheur Park is a baseball park located on the banks of the Merrimack River in Lowell, Massachusetts. It is home to the New York–Penn League Lowell Spinners, the Class A Short Season Affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. LeLacheur Park is also home to the UMass Lowell River Hawks baseball team, which currently competes in the America East Conference at the NCAA Division I level as of the start of the 2014 season. History The park was built between a partnership with the city of Lowell and the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The park was named for State Representative Edward A. LeLacheur, who led the initial redevelopment of Lowell, and opened in 1998. The park was built adjacent to the residential section of UML. Populous (formerly HOK Sport) designed the park. It offers views of the Aiken Street Bridge, Lawrence Mills, Fox Hall, and University Suites. The seating bowl is raised above the field. A concourse surrounds the top of the park where the refreshment, merchandise stands, and bathrooms are located. The design enables an open view while waiting in line. Two seating expansions have been considered since the park opened. One plan would have added 600-1,000 seats on the third base side. The expansion would match how the first base side is angled towards the infield. The other proposal was to add a smaller version of the Green Monster with seating for approximately 200 people. This also would have shortened the field and raised the wall to . Due to lack of funds, neither have been built. The stadium also features the Giant Hood Milk Jug from Fenway Park and all Red Sox retired numbers. The ballpark held its first concert on July 10, 2008 when Boston-based Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys played there with The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

The program is currently hosted by Tracy Grimshaw on weeknights, and Deborah Knight on Saturday nights. History=1970s= A Current Affair was first broadcast on 22 November 1971, with Mike Willesee, screening week nights at 7:00 p.m., and was broadcast for GTV-9. For part of its early run, the comedian and actor Paul Hogan had a comic social commentary segment. Under Willesee, ACA was a Transmedia production for the Nine Network.Class of 74 at MemorableTV When Willesee left Nine in 1974 to move to the rival 0–10 Network, journalist Mike Minehan took over presenting ACA. Other hosts included Sue Smith, Kevin Sanders and Michael Schildberger.Sue Smith obituary Variety.com\\"A Trailblazer in Current Affairs\\" SMH TV Week, 19 March 1977 at TelevisionAU The original A Current Affair was cancelled on 28 April 1978, followed by strong competitions in the 7:00 p.m. timeslot from Willesee at Seven on Seven Network and Graham Kennedy's Blankety Blanks on the 0–10 Network. In 1984, Willesee returned to the Nine Network to revive the format in a series titled Willesee, screening Monday to Thursday nights at 9:30. The following year, Willesee moved to the earlier 6:30 p.m. timeslot and extended to five nights a week, running until 1988, when Willesee's production company, Transmedia, sold the rights to the program to the Nine Network. =1988 revival= When Willesee left the presenting role, former 60 Minutes presenter Jana Wendt took over on 18 January 1988 and the show once again became A Current Affair. This was the same week the Seven Network's soap opera Home and Away was introduced, and in Melbourne where Derryn Hinch debuted rival current affairs program Hinch at Seven.. The Seven Network introduced direct competition with Real Life, which later became Today Tonight. Jana Wendt left the program in November 1992, unhappy with an ACA story showing topless women.Nine wins Sunday, as Jana Watches Her Back eBroadcast.com In 1993, original ACA host Mike Willesee took over for the whole year. In February 1994, Ray Martin took over. Martin signed off at the end of November 1998. When Mike Munro was axed from the program in 2002, he returned to This Is Your Life, 60 Minutes, and later National Nine News in Sydney. After Mike Munro's departure, Ray Martin returned in February 2003, and signed off again at the start of December 2005. During the 2005/2006 holiday period, the Nine Network announced that ACA was to be \\"rested\\" for four weeks to enable a major revamp of the production to take place. On 30 January 2006, two weeks after the program's return, ACA was re-launched with new host Tracy Grimshaw. =State editions= Launching in 1991, QTQ-9 in Brisbane produced a local version of the program, titled Extra. It carried local stories including the lead up to its NRL Grand Finals. Despite its eighteen long years of popularity and ratings success, the local current affairs program was axed, due to a major schedule cleanup for making space for Nine's now-scrapped one-hour current affairs program, This Afternoon, hosted by Andrew Daddo, Katrina Blowers and Mark Ferguson from 4:30pm weekdays starting the following Monday after its final ever broadcast. The decision was part of a push to nationalise lead-in content for the network's struggling news bulletins. The game show Hot Seat was moved to replace Extra at 5.30pm. In 2002, NWS-9 in Adelaide produced a local version of the program hosted by weekend news presenter Georgina McGuinness. It carried national stories, but featured more local stories including the lead up to the 2002 AFL Grand Final. The Adelaide edition was short lived due to the very heavy competition of the Seven Network Adelaide's Today Tonight. In January 2008, WIN Corporation announced that a new local version of ACA would be produced in Western Australia to replace the east coast version hosted by Tracy Grimshaw. It was hosted by Louise Momber, with special investigators Peter van Onselen and Michael Southwell. The first state based edition since Adelaide in 2002, the program's initial host, former news presenter Sonia Vinci, resigned prior to the show's commencement and was replaced by Louise Momber. The program was launched on 20 October 2008. A week later on 27 October, WIN launched an Adelaide version of the show on Adelaide, with Adelaide's National Nine News reporter Kate Collins presenting. Both versions were short-lived – on 30 November 2009, WIN announced that Perth and Adelaide would return to the national format.

Stories covered by ACA rotate around community issues i.e. diet fads, miracle cures, welfare cheats, shonky builders, negligent doctors, poorly run businesses and corrupt government officials. =Paxton controversy= In 1996, the show reported on the Paxton family from the impoverished Melbourne suburb of St Albans. The family were told that the show was about helping the family members to get jobs, but the version that aired claimed that the family were \\"dole bludgers\\" refusing reasonable offers of employment. After the story aired, the family received death threats. =Greg Hodge defamation= In September 2006 ACA was ordered to pay over $320,000 to former Australian swimming coach Greg Hodge in relation to indefensible defamatory allegations made in a 2003 story relating to Hodge's conduct towards a former swim student. =Peter Anthony Haertsch defamation= In March 2010 ACA was found to have defamed acclaimed plastic surgeon Peter Anthony Haertsch in allegations aired in a 2008 report about a Gold Coast woman's breast enlargement procedure, and ordered to pay $268,000 damages. =Lev Mizikovsky defamation= In June 2008 ACA broadcast a program about Queensland property developer Lev Mizikovsky. Mizikovsky sued ACA claiming he was defamed by the broadcast and in November 2011 a jury agreed, but found the defamatory meanings were defensible. Mizikovsky is now liable for costs, which are reported to exceed $2 million. =All-Asian Mall controversy= On 7 November 2012, a segment was broadcast giving the impression that Asian people were taking over a shopping centre in Castle Hill, New South Wales. After numerous viewer complaints, the Australian Communications and Media Authority found the segment had breached the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice in three clauses, including \\"containing inaccurate factual material\\", \\"placing gratuitous emphasis on ethnic origin\\" and \\"likely to provoke intense dislike and serious contempt on the grounds of ethnic origin\\".

It is the home ballpark of the Spokane Indians, a minor league baseball team in the Class A-Short Season Northwest League.History at spokaneindiansbaseball.com, URL accessed October 18, 2009. Archived 10/18/09 History Built in less than four months at the Interstate Fairgrounds, the stadium opened in 1958 and has a seating capacity large for Class A ballpark. The facility was built for Triple-A in the Pacific Coast League, which it hosted for 24 of its first 25 seasons. The parent club in 1958 was the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had just moved out west from Brooklyn and moved their PCL affiliate, the Los Angeles Angels, north to Spokane. They stayed for fourteen seasons, through 1971, then departed to New Mexico and became the Albuquerque Dukes. After one year in the short-season Northwest League as a Dodger affiliate, the Triple-A PCL returned in 1973, from Portland, as the Texas Rangers' top affiliate. The Milwaukee Brewers became the Indians' parent club in 1976, the Seattle Mariners in 1979, and the California Angels in 1982. The Indians left for Las Vegas after the 1982 season and the NWL returned in 1983 and has remained for over three decades. Earlier ballparks The preceding minor league ballpark in Spokane was Ferris Field, which was about a mile (1½ km) west, on the west side of Playfair Race Course. Named for city attorney George M. Ferris, its original wooden grandstand was built in 1936. Ferris was a former player and manager for the Indians who secured funding from the Works Progress Administration to build it. A fire in October 1948 damaged most of the grandstands, and it was rebuilt using concrete and steel in the spring of 1949. Earlier baseball venues in Spokane were Recreation Park (), Natatorium Park (), and the original Twickenham Park. In 1954, four-year-old Memorial Stadium (now Joe Albi Stadium) was considered as a potential minor league baseball venue. Other uses For three seasons beginning in 2004, the Gonzaga Bulldogs used the stadium as its home venue while its current venue was being built. Their former ballpark was displaced by the new McCarthey Athletic Center. In 2011, the Spokane Chiefs hosted the first outdoor game in Western Hockey League history at Avista Stadium on January 15; the home team routed the Kootenay Ice Stadium name Naming rights were purchased in 1998 (and the stadium renamed after the 1999 season) by Avista, the Spokane-based utility founded in 1889 as Washington Water Power Company. The venue's first corporate name was Seafirst Stadium, from 1994 through 1999.

Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, 546 U.S. 320 (2006), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving a facial challenge to New Hampshire's parental notification abortion law. The First Circuit had ruled that the law was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement was proper. The Supreme Court vacated this judgment and remanded the case, but avoided a substantive ruling on the challenged law or a reconsideration of prior Supreme Court abortion precedent. Instead, the Court only addressed the issue of remedy, holding that invalidating a statute in its entirety \\"is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.\\" The opinion was delivered by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had been significantly responsible for developing the Court's recent abortion jurisprudence.O'Connor was one of the three attributed authors of the plurality opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), that adopted the \\"undue burden\\" standard for reviewing whether abortion regulations were too stringent, a standard she herself had previously formulated in her concurring opinion in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989). This decision was O'Connor's last opinion on the Court before her retirement on January 31, 2006.  Background  In June, 2003, the New Hampshire Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act, \\"an act requiring parental notification before abortions may be performed on unemancipated minors,\\" was narrowly passed by the New Hampshire General Court.Introduced as House Bill 763-FN. The act passed with a vote of 12-11 in the New Hampshire Senate and 187-181 in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. It was signed into law on June 19, 2003 by Governor Craig Benson, who had lobbied heavily for the law, with an effective date of December 31, 2003. =District Court proceedings= On November 17, 2003, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, Concord Feminist Health Center of Portsmouth, Feminist Health Center of Portsmouth, and Wayne Goldner, M.D. filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Parental Notification Act was unconstitutional and a preliminary injunction to prevent its enforcement once it became effective. On December 29, 2003, Judge Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire issued an order finding the Parental Notification Act unconstitutional and permanently enjoining its enforcement.Order of the United States District Court of New Hampshire (.pdf). DiClerico found the Act unconstitutional on the following grounds: *the Act's lack of an explicit exception to protect the health of the pregnant minor, and *the narrowness of the Act's exception for abortions necessary to prevent the minor's death DiClerico declined to rule on the plaintiffs' other claim, that the Act was unconstitutional for failing to provide specific protections for the confidentiality of a minor seeking a judicial waiver. =Court of Appeals decision= New Hampshire Attorney General Peter Heed appealed the district court's order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Heed argued that the court should apply the \\"no set of circumstances\\" standard set forth in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987). A three judge panel composed of Chief Judge Michael Boudin, Circuit Judge Juan R. Torruella and District Judge Saris unanimously affirmed the judgment by Judge DiClerico for the same reasons he stated.Heed v. Planned Parenthood, 390 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2004), full text (.pdf).  Opinion of the Court  Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, who replaced Heed in 2004, appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States over the objections of Benson's successor, Governor John Lynch. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case, which was the first case challenging an abortion law that the Court had accepted in five years. Lynch subsequently submitted an amicus curiae brief in opposition to the Parental Notification Act.Lynch's brief was filed with the Court October 12, 2005. See . The Court vacated the judgment of the First Circuit in a unanimous decision authored by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term — Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 293 (2006). The Court did not revisit any abortion precedents, such as its decision in Casey. =O'Connor's unanimous opinion= In its ruling the Court found that the following three propositions were established: #\\"States have the right to require parental involvement when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy.\\" #\\"A State may not restrict access to abortions that are 'necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for preservation of the life or health of the mother.' Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 879 (plurality opinion).\\" #\\"New Hampshire has not taken issue with the case’s factual basis: In a very small percentage of cases, pregnant minors need immediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible damage to their health. New Hampshire has conceded that, under this Court’s cases, it would be unconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant health risks.\\" The Court considered under what circumstances federal courts can enjoin enforcement of abortion laws if in some cases such laws would have the effect of regulating abortion more strictly than is consistent with Supreme Court precedent, as the New Hampshire law did in some circumstances. The Court ruled that in such circumstances facial invalidation of a statute would be inappropriate if the statute could be narrowed sufficiently by judicial interpretation. It raised the question of what the appropriate judicial remedy would be if a statute's enforcement would be unconstitutional in medical emergencies. The court ruled that \\"invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.\\"  Subsequent developments  The New Hampshire law was repealed in 2007, making rehearing at the district court level moot.Planned Parenthood to have attorney's fees paid, Seacoastonline.com. The New Hampshire parental notification law was passed again in 2011 after the Republican controlled House and Senate overrode then Democrat governor John Lynch's veto.

History and culture  Shilluk woman holding a jar Photo of Shilluk \\"material culture\\" from the late 1870s More Shilluk \\"material culture\\" The shilluk and the Anuak are the closest related members of the Luo Nilotic groups, many of the words in the shilluk language are made up of words from dha anywaa or the Anuak language. Historically, the Shilluk were led by a king Reth who is considered to be from the divine lineage of the culture hero Nyikang, and whose health is believed to affect that of the nation. Formerly, their society was fairly hierarchical, with castes of royals, nobles, commoners, and slaves. Like most Nilotic groups, cattle-raising formed a large part of their economy; however, agriculture and fishing were more significant than usual, and most were sedentary. The Shilluk people created the Shilluk Kingdom which existed in Southern Sudan since (1454 to Present).  Religion  Most Shilluk have converted to Christianity, while some still follow the traditional religion or a mixture of the two; small numbers have converted to Islam. The Shilluk pride themselves in being one of the first Nilotic groups to accept Christianity, the other being the Anuak people. The Episcopal Church of the Sudan which dates the event to the late 19th Century when the Church Mission Society first began to send missionaries. Colonial policies and missionary movements have divided Shilluk into between the Catholic and Protestant denominations. The Catholic Church was historically assigned the western bank of the Nile and ran missions stations at Lul, Detwoc, Tonga and Yoynyang, while the American Inland Mission ran a mission station at Doleib Hill, located to the south of Malakal on the eastern side of the Nile, but situated on the Sobat river. The Shilluk were a minority in the SPLM faction for most of the Second Sudanese Civil War, their number peaking in the late 1980s and the pre-ceasefire fighting in 2004.  Violence  During the summer of 2010, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), in an attempt to disarm the tribe and stop a local Shilluk rebellion, burned a number of villages and killed an untold number of civilians in South Sudan's Shilluk Kingdom. Over 10,000 people were displaced in the midst of the rainy season and sent fleeing into the forest, often naked, without bedding, shelter or food, with many children dying from hunger and cold. Violence has started again in April 2011 with a SPLA crackdown on rebel controlled regions. Shilluk and well as Nuba are the alleged victims.

Opened in 1947, it has been the home field of the Everett AquaSox, a Minor League Baseball team in the Northwest League, and its predecessor, the Everett Giants, since 1984. In 2019, the ballpark became known as Funko Field. The football stadium has been home to the Everett Reign, a women's football team, since 2013. The complex is owned by the Everett School District, whose schools use both stadiums for their athletic programs. It is also home to the Puget Sound Festival of Bands, an annual marching band competition. The facility was remodeled in 1998 to have a seating capacity of 3,682 people for baseball and 12,000 for football. History The stadium sits on land donated by the Everett Lodge of Elks 479 to the Everett School District in 1947, dedicated in memory of Everett citizens who died during military service in World War II. The first professional team to play at the stadium was the Everett Giants, playing in the Northwest League of Class A baseball. The first Giants game held at the stadium was played against the Bellingham Mariners in front of a crowd of 3,527 on June 19, 1984. On June 17, 1987, with 3,122 fans watching, Ken Griffey Jr., playing for the Bellingham Mariners, hit his first professional home run over the left field wall, with the ball landing in the street approximately from home plate. A plaque on the sidewalk marks the site just outside the left field wall. The baseball stadium underwent extensive renovations in 1998, at a cost of $5 million. The upgrade increased capacity by 1,400 seats to the present 3,682 and added a larger concession area and new lighting. The renovation was funded by a motel-hotel tax approved by the Washington State Legislature in 1994. On October 17, 2017, citing the poor condition of the field's natural grass surface when the stadium was used by the Everett High School and Everett Community College baseball teams, which rendered the field near-unusable for games played by both schools, the natural grass field was switched to an artificial surface. Work began on October 31, 2017, and was completed in April 2018. It is one of three ballparks in the Northwest League to have an artificial turf field. The Eugene Emeralds' PK Park and the Hillsboro Hops' Ron Tonkin Field are the others. On March 19, 2019, the Everett School Board approved a $1.1 million, eight-year sponsorship agreement with local toymaker Funko to brand the baseball field as Funko Field at Everett Memorial Stadium. The stadium's parking lot was home to a temporary COVID-19 testing center during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The testing center, operated by the Snohomish Health District, opened on March 23 and closed on April 16 after processing 2,500 people.

By Paul Buhle, Dave WagnerNNDB - Sister, Sister (1982) Plot The story starts out in a small town in North Carolina with Carolyne Lovejoy (Carroll), a schoolteacher, singing in the church choir at the local church. It is later revealed that she is having an intense affair with the pastor, Reverend Henderson (Dick Anthony Williams) who is also the state senator-elect. Carolyne later comes home to find her younger sister (who she raised after the death of their parents), 20-year old Sissy (Cara), with her boyfriend, Johnny. It is expressed that Sissy is an aspiring ice skater, but Carolyne wants her to follow in her footsteps and become a schoolteacher. Their battle continues throughout the movie. Later their estranged sister, Frieda (Cash), who has been living 13 years in the slums of Detroit, shows up with her 12-year-old son, Danny (Kristoff St. John). They decide to stay for a while because Danny has had some trouble with the law and Frieda wants to give him a fresh start in a new environment. While all trying to co-exist in the same house, the sisters' lives turn upside down. Frieda suggest the idea of selling their childhood, stating their youngest sister will be out on her own soon and all the space isn't need for just Carolyne. Frieda emerges as the troubled black sheep, while Carolyne is knocked off her martyr pedestal when the minister succumbs to Frieda's seduction. Sissy learns that their father never wanted another daughter, but had hoped she would be the son that eluded him. Their mother tried to abort her. After a physical altercation with Frieda and Carolyne, Frieda and Sissy decided to leave. The movie ends with Sissy leaving for New York and Frieda deciding to stay and work things out with Carolyne. Production Although the movie was filmed in February 1979, NBC chose to withhold it until June 1982, when it aired during primetime. According to JET, Fred Silverman, who was the head executive of the network at the time, decided not to air the film because it did not match his preferred formats of \\"action- packed or comedy shows,\\" and that the film's focus on the intense personal dramas of middle-class blacks would not appeal to white sensibilities of the late 1970s. After Silverman's resignation, the new network president, Grant Tinker, decided to make his mark on NBC's programming by debuting all of the productions that Silverman had shelved.Why 'Sister, Sister' Film Was Kept Off The Air For Three Years, JET, June 21, 1982.

It is described as a member of the family Madtsoiidae, that includes the species such as Wonambi naracoortensis, present in Australia until the Pleistocene. The name of the genus is derived from traditional name given by the people of Arnhem Land to the Rainbow serpent. They were large snakes, up to 6 metres long and 300 millimetres thick, that are more closely resemble Varanus (monitors) than small burrowing lizards. John Scanlon has presented this as evidence of descent from the former, rather than burrowing ancestors that evolved into the elongate and legless snakes. The fossil material described by this species includes a rare example of a complete skull and mandible, often crushed in the fossilisation process, that was preserved in the soft limestone of a body of fresh water.

The model's name comes from a common application, the use of such models to represent the current size of a population where the transitions are literal births and deaths. Birth–death processes have many applications in demography, queueing theory, performance engineering, epidemiology, biology and other areas. They may be used, for example, to study the evolution of bacteria, the number of people with a disease within a population, or the number of customers in line at the supermarket. When a birth occurs, the process goes from state n to n + 1\\\\. When a death occurs, the process goes from state n to state n − 1\\\\. The process is specified by birth rates \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=0\\\\dots\\\\infty} and death rates \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1\\\\dots\\\\infty}. State diagram of a birth-death process Recurrence and transience For recurrence and transience in Markov processes see Section 5.3 from Markov chain. =Conditions for recurrence and transience= Conditions for recurrence and transience were established by Samuel Karlin and James McGregor. :A birth-and-death process is recurrent if and only if ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\prod_{n=1}^i\\\\frac{\\\\mu_n}{\\\\lambda_n}=\\\\infty. :A birth-and-death process is ergodic if and only if ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\prod_{n=1}^i\\\\frac{\\\\mu_n}{\\\\lambda_n}=\\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\prod_{n=1}^i\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{n-1}}{\\\\mu_n}<\\\\infty. :A birth- and-death process is null-recurrent if and only if ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\prod_{n=1}^i\\\\frac{\\\\mu_n}{\\\\lambda_n}=\\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\prod_{n=1}^i\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{n-1}}{\\\\mu_n}=\\\\infty. By using Extended Bertrand's test (see Section 4.1.4 from Ratio test) the conditions for recurrence, transience, ergodicity and null-recurrence can be derived in a more explicit form. For integer K\\\\geq1, let \\\\ln_{(K)}(x) denote the Kth iterate of natural logarithm, i.e. \\\\ln_{(1)}(x)=\\\\ln (x) and for any 2\\\\leq k\\\\leq K, \\\\ln_{(k)}(x)=\\\\ln_{(k-1)}(\\\\ln (x)). Then, the conditions for recurrence and transience of a birth-and-death process are as follows. :The birth-and-death process is transient if there exist c > 1, K\\\\geq1 and n_0 such that for all n > n_0 ::\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_n}{\\\\mu_n}\\\\geq1+\\\\frac{1}{n}+\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\prod_{j=1}^k\\\\ln_{(j)}(n)}+\\\\frac{c}{\\\\prod_{j=1}^K\\\\ln_{(j)}(n)}, where the empty sum for K=1 is assumed to be 0. :The birth-and-death process is recurrent if there exist K\\\\geq1 and n_0 such that for all n > n_0 ::\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_n}{\\\\mu_n}\\\\leq1+\\\\frac{1}{n}+\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\prod_{j=1}^k\\\\ln_{(j)}(n)}. =Application= Consider one-dimensional random walk S_t, \\\\ t=0,1,\\\\ldots, that is defined as follows. Let S_0=1, and S_t=S_{t-1}+e_t, \\\\ t\\\\geq1, where e_t takes values \\\\pm1, and the distribution of S_t is defined by the following conditions: ::\\\\mathsf{P}\\\\\\\\{S_{t+1}=S_t+1S_t>0\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{S_t}}{S_t}, \\\\quad \\\\mathsf{P}\\\\\\\\{S_{t+1}=S_t-1S_t>0\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{S_t}}{S_t}, \\\\quad \\\\mathsf{P}\\\\\\\\{S_{t+1}=1S_t=0\\\\\\\\}=1, where \\\\alpha_n satisfy the condition 0<\\\\alpha_n<\\\\min\\\\\\\\{C, n/2\\\\\\\\}, C>0. The random walk described here is a discrete time analogue of the birth-and-death process (see Markov chain) with the birth rates ::\\\\lambda_n=\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{n}}{n}, and the death rates ::\\\\mu_n=\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{n}}{n}. So, recurrence or transience of the random walk is associated with recurrence or transience of the birth-and-death process. :The random walk is transient if there exist c>1, K\\\\geq1 and n_0 such that for all n>n_0 ::\\\\alpha_n\\\\geq\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\left(1+\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1}\\\\prod_{j=1}^k\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln_{(j)}(n)}+c\\\\prod_{j=1}^K\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln_{(j)}(n)}\\\\right), where the empty sum for K=1 is assumed to be zero. :The random walk is recurrent if there exist K\\\\geq1 and n_0 such that for all n>n_0 ::\\\\alpha_n\\\\leq\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\left(1+\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\\\prod_{j=1}^k\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln_{(j)}(n)}\\\\right). Stationary solution If a birth-and-death process is ergodic, then there exists steady-state probabilities \\\\pi_k=\\\\lim_{t\\\\to\\\\infty}p_k(t), where p_k(t) is the probability that the birth-and-death process is in state k at time t. The limit exists, independent of the initial values p_k(0), and is calculated by the relations: ::\\\\pi_k=\\\\pi_0\\\\prod_{i=1}^k\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{i-1}}{\\\\mu_i},\\\\quad k=1,2,\\\\ldots, ::\\\\pi_0=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty\\\\prod_{i=1}^k\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{i-1}}{\\\\mu_i}}. These limiting probabilities are obtained from the infinite system of differential equations for p_k(t): :p_0^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\mu_1 p_1(t)-\\\\lambda_0 p_0(t) \\\\, :p_k^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\lambda_{k-1} p_{k-1}(t)+\\\\mu_{k+1} p_{k+1}(t)-(\\\\lambda_k +\\\\mu_k) p_k(t), k=1,2,\\\\ldots, \\\\, and the initial condition \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty p_k(t)=1. In turn, the last system of differential equations is derived from the system of difference equations that describes the dynamic of the system in a small time \\\\Delta t. During this small time \\\\Delta t only three types of transitions are considered as one death, or one birth, or no birth nor death. The probability of the first two of these transitions has the order of \\\\Delta t. Other transitions during this small interval \\\\Delta t such as more than one birth, or more than one death, or at least one birth and at least one death have the probabilities that are of smaller order than \\\\Delta t, and hence are negligible in derivations. If the system is in state k, then the probability of birth during an interval \\\\Delta t is \\\\lambda_k\\\\Delta t+o(\\\\Delta t), the probability of death is \\\\mu_k\\\\Delta t+o(\\\\Delta t), and the probability of no birth and no death is 1-\\\\lambda_k\\\\Delta t-\\\\mu_k\\\\Delta t+o(\\\\Delta t). For a population process, \\"birth\\" is the transition towards increasing the population size by 1 while \\"death\\" is the transition towards decreasing the population size by 1. Examples of birth-death processes A pure birth process is a birth–death process where \\\\mu_{i} = 0 for all i \\\\ge 0. A pure death process is a birth–death process where \\\\lambda_{i} = 0 for all i \\\\ge 0. M/M/1 model and M/M/c model, both used in queueing theory, are birth–death processes used to describe customers in an infinite queue. Use in queueing theory In queueing theory the birth–death process is the most fundamental example of a queueing model, the M/M/C/K/\\\\infty/FIFO (in complete Kendall's notation) queue. This is a queue with Poisson arrivals, drawn from an infinite population, and C servers with exponentially distributed service times with K places in the queue. Despite the assumption of an infinite population this model is a good model for various telecommunication systems. =M/M/1 queue= The M/M/1 is a single server queue with an infinite buffer size. In a non- random environment the birth–death process in queueing models tend to be long- term averages, so the average rate of arrival is given as \\\\lambda and the average service time as 1/\\\\mu. The birth and death process is an M/M/1 queue when, :\\\\lambda_{i}=\\\\lambda\\\\text{ and }\\\\mu_{i}=\\\\mu\\\\text{ for all }i. \\\\, The differential equations for the probability that the system is in state k at time t are :p_0^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\mu p_1(t)-\\\\lambda p_0(t), \\\\, :p_k^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\lambda p_{k-1}(t)+\\\\mu p_{k+1}(t)-(\\\\lambda +\\\\mu) p_k(t) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } k=1,2,\\\\ldots \\\\, =Pure birth process associated with an M/M/1 queue= Pure birth process with \\\\lambda_k\\\\equiv\\\\lambda is a particular case of the M/M/1 queueing process. We have the following system of differential equations: :p_0^\\\\prime(t)=-\\\\lambda p_0(t), \\\\, :p_k^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\lambda p_{k-1}(t)-\\\\lambda p_k(t) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } k=1,2,\\\\ldots \\\\, Under the initial condition p_0(0)=1 and p_k(0)=0, \\\\ k=1,2,\\\\ldots, the solution of the system is ::p_k(t)=\\\\frac{(\\\\lambda t)^k}{k!}\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\lambda t}. That is, a (homogeneous) Poisson process is a pure birth process. =M/M/c queue= The M/M/C is a multi-server queue with C servers and an infinite buffer. It characterizes by the following birth and death parameters: :\\\\mu_i = i\\\\mu \\\\quad \\\\text{ for }i\\\\leq C-1, \\\\, and :\\\\mu_i = C\\\\mu \\\\quad \\\\text{ for }i\\\\geq C, \\\\, with :\\\\lambda_i = \\\\lambda \\\\quad \\\\text{ for all }i. \\\\, The system of differential equations in this case has the form: :p_0^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\mu p_1(t)-\\\\lambda p_0(t), \\\\, :p_k^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\lambda p_{k-1}(t)+(k+1)\\\\mu p_{k+1}(t)-(\\\\lambda +k\\\\mu) p_k(t) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } k=1,2,\\\\ldots,C-1, \\\\, :p_k^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\lambda p_{k-1}(t)+C\\\\mu p_{k+1}(t)-(\\\\lambda +C\\\\mu) p_k(t) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } k\\\\geq C. \\\\, =Pure death process associated with an M/M/C queue= Pure death process with \\\\mu_k= k\\\\mu is a particular case of the M/M/C queueing process. We have the following system of differential equations: :p_C^\\\\prime(t)=-C\\\\mu p_C(t), \\\\, :p_k^\\\\prime(t)=(k+1)\\\\mu p_{k+1}(t)-k\\\\mu p_k(t) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } k=0,1,\\\\ldots,C-1. \\\\, Under the initial condition p_C(0)=1 and p_k(0)=0, \\\\ k=0,1,\\\\ldots, C-1, we obtain the solution ::p_k(t)=\\\\binom{C}{k}\\\\mathrm{e}^{-k\\\\mu t}\\\\left(1-\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mu t}\\\\right)^{C-k}, that presents the version of binomial distribution depending of time parameter t (see Binomial process). =M/M/1/K queue= The M/M/1/K queue is a single server queue with a buffer of size K. This queue has applications in telecommunications, as well as in biology when a population has a capacity limit. In telecommunication we again use the parameters from the M/M/1 queue with, :\\\\lambda_i = \\\\lambda \\\\quad \\\\text{ for }0 \\\\leq i < K, \\\\, :\\\\lambda_i=0 \\\\quad \\\\text{ for }i\\\\geq K, \\\\, :\\\\mu_i=\\\\mu \\\\quad \\\\text{ for }1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq K. \\\\, In biology, particularly the growth of bacteria, when the population is zero there is no ability to grow so, :\\\\lambda_0=0. \\\\, Additionally if the capacity represents a limit where the individual dies from over population, :\\\\mu_K = 0. \\\\, The differential equations for the probability that the system is in state k at time t are :p_0^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\mu p_1(t)-\\\\lambda p_0(t), :p_k^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\lambda p_{k-1}(t)+\\\\mu p_{k+1}(t)-(\\\\lambda +\\\\mu) p_k(t) \\\\quad \\\\text{ for }k \\\\leq K-1, \\\\, :p_K^\\\\prime(t)=\\\\lambda p_{K-1}(t)-(\\\\lambda +\\\\mu) p_K(t), \\\\, :p_k(t)=0 \\\\quad \\\\text{ for }k > K. \\\\, Equilibrium A queue is said to be in equilibrium if the steady state probabilities \\\\pi_k=\\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty}p_k(t), \\\\ k=0,1,\\\\ldots, exist. The condition for the existence of these steady-state probabilities in the case of M/M/1 queue is \\\\rho=\\\\lambda/\\\\mu<1 and in the case of M/M/C queue is \\\\rho=\\\\lambda/(C\\\\mu)<1. The parameter \\\\rho is usually called load parameter or utilization parameter. Sometimes it is also called traffic intensity.

The work of sculptor Ron Robertson-Swann, Vault is an abstract, minimalist sculpture built of large thick flat polygonal sheets of prefabricated steel, assembled in a way that suggests dynamic movement. It is painted yellow. Presently located outside the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, it is a key work in Melbourne's public art collection, and of considerable historical importance to the city. Vault has weathered much controversy throughout its existence. Commissioned by the Melbourne City Council after winning a competition in May 1978, for the newly built Melbourne City Square, the sculpture was not even built before it began to attract criticism from conservative media and council factions, on the grounds that its modern form was felt to be unsympathetic to the location. The cost of $70,000 was also felt to be excessive. The sculpture had no official name for over two years, and acquired a number of nicknames during this time. Robertson-Swann himself called it The Thing. The steelworkers who constructed it called it Steelhenge. Newspapers gave it the derogatory nickname The Yellow Peril, a name which has stuck. Robertson-Swann eventually officially named the sculpture Vault in September 1980. Installed in the City Square in May 1980, Vault lasted until December of that year, when its dismantling coincided with the State Government's sacking of the City Council. The Builders Labourers Federation consequently placed bans on further City Square work projects. In 1981, the Vault was re-erected at Batman Park, a less prominent part of the city. It remained there until 2002 when it was moved to a position outside the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in Southbank. In 2017, the sculpture was recommended for heritage protection, through inclusion in the City of Melbourne Planning Scheme Heritage Overlay, following a heritage study of the Southbank Area.'Controversial Vault sculpture to get heritage protection in Southbank planning review', IAN ROYALL AND JAYITRI SMILES, Herald Sun 6 November 2017 Vault has been inspirational for some built and propositional architectural projects designed in Melbourne.

The term was also used to refer to those convicts whose sentences had expired, and might sometimes be used of free settlers who supported full civil rights for emancipated convicts. An emancipist was free to own land and was no longer subject to penal servitude. An emancipist could be released from his or her sentence for good behaviour, diligent work or the expiration of his or her sentence. One limitation placed upon emancipists with a conditional pardon – a ticket-of-leave – was that they were not allowed to leave the Australian colonies. This limitation did not apply to former convicts whose terms of servitude had expired, or who had been unconditionally pardoned, and more than half of all male convicts did leave the Australian colonies on the expiration of their sentence [it was more difficult for female emancipists to leave, as they had fewer opportunities of \\"working their passage\\" away from the colonies]. The Exclusives (who included many free settlers, civil servants and military officers) often shunned the society of emancipists, and considered them to be little more than criminals. When Governor Lachlan Macquarie invited emancipists to social functions at Government House, for example, many military officers refused to attend. Macquarie (Governor from 1810 to 1821) insisted that emancipated convicts be treated as social equals and, very conscious of the critical shortage of skills in the young colony, appointed emancipists with talent to official positions. Among these appointments were Francis Greenway as colonial architect and Dr. William Redfern as colonial surgeon. He scandalised settler opinion by appointing another emancipist, Andrew Thompson, as a magistrate. John Hamilton Irving (or Irven, Irwin, or Ervin) was Australia's first emancipist. Irving was a surgeon convicted of larceny on 6 March 1784. He was sentenced to \\"seven years beyond the seas,\\" and sent on one of the First Fleet transports in 1788. After exhibiting a willing readiness to assist with his exceptional surgical skills, he was emancipated by Governor Arthur Phillip on 28 February 1790, and worked thereafter as an assistant surgeon. On 14 July 1792, Irving's Warrant of Emancipation was received in England and acknowledged by Henry Dundas, the Secretary of State.

Its independence ended in 1834 when the estates not bequeathed to princes Victor and Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfurst were reunited with Hesse- Kassel. History The line of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) was founded by William IV, surnamed the Wise, eldest son of Philip the Magnanimous. On his father's death in 1567, he received one half of Hesse, with Cassel as his capital; this formed the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. Additions were made to it by inheritance from his brother's possessions. His son, Maurice the Learned (1572–1632) was Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel from 1592 until 1627. Maurice turned Calvinist in 1605, became involved later in the Thirty Years' War, and, after being forced to cede some of his territories to the Darmstadt line, abdicated in 1627 in favour of his son William V (1602-1637). His younger sons received apanages, which created several cadet lines of the house (Hesse-Rotenburg, Hesse-Eschwege and Hesse-Rheinfels), of which, with amalgamation, that of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg survived till 1834. In 1627, Ernest (1623–1693), a younger son of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, received Rheinfels and lower Katzenelnbogen as his inheritance. Some years later, on the deaths of two of his brothers, Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse-Eschwege (1617–1655) and Herman IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg (1607–1658), he added Eschwege, Rotenburg, Wanfried and other districts to his possessions. Ernest, who was a convert to the Roman Catholic Church, was a great traveller and a voluminous writer. About 1700 his two sons, William (d. 1725) and Charles (or Karl) (d. 1711), divided their territories, and founded the families of Hesse-Rotenburg and Hesse-Wanfried.This source does not make it clear which branch of the family acquired Rheinfels and Eschwege . The latter family died out in 1755, when William's grandson, Constantine (d. 1778), reunited the lands except Rheinfels, which had been acquired by Hesse-Kassel in 1735, and ruled them as Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg. At the peace of Lunéville in 1801, the part of the landgraviate on the left bank of the Rhine was surrendered to France and, in 1815, other parts were ceded to Prussia, the landgrave Victor Amadeus being compensated by the abbey of Corvey and the Silesian Duchy of Ratibor. Victor was the last male member of his family, so, with the consent of Prussia, he bequeathed his allodial estates to his nephews the princes Victor and Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfurst. When the landgrave died on 12 November 1834 the remaining parts of Hesse-Rotenburg were united with Hesse- Kassel according to the arrangement of 1627. It may be noted that Hesse- Rotenburg was never completely independent of Hesse-Kassel. Perhaps the most famous member of this family was Charles Constantine (1752–1821), a younger son of Landgrave Constantine, who took part in the French Revolution under the name Citoyen Hesse.

W.) Hammons (1882–1962). Educational primarily distributed short subjects, and today is probably best known for its series of 1930s comedies starring Buster Keaton,The theater and cinema of Buster Keaton, by Robert Knopf as well as for a series of one-reel comedies featuring the earliest screen appearances of Shirley Temple. The studio also distributed short comedies starring Lloyd Hamilton, who employed the blacklisted \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle as a writer-director under the pseudonym William Goodrich.  Business history  Hammons established the company to make instructional films for schools, but making comedies for theatrical release proved more lucrative.The Great Movie Shorts, by Leonard Maltin Educational did issue many educational, travelogue, and novelty shorts, but its main enterprise became comedy.Stereoscopic cinema & the origins of 3-D film, 1838-1952, By Ray Zone Educational's heyday was the 1920s, when the popular silent comedies of Al St. John, Lupino Lane, Lige Conley, Lloyd Hamilton,Lloyd Hamilton: Poor Boy Comedian of Silent Cinema, By Anthony Balducci and Monty Collins complemented many a moviehouse bill as \\"the spice of the program.\\" Educational also released silent cartoons, including the Felix the Cat series. In 1930, cartoonist Paul Terry signed with Educational to distribute his Terrytoons animated cartoons in America and British countries. Educational made a smooth transition to sound movies by handling the early talking comedies of pioneer producer Mack Sennett. Sennett also introduced singing star Bing Crosby to movie audiences. But Sennett soon became plagued by financial problems, and he left Educational in 1932.A History of the Hal Roach Studios, By Richard Lewis Ward Most of Educational's silent stars made only a few talkies for the studio: Lupino Lane left the company in 1930, followed by Lloyd Hamilton in 1931. Most of the earliest Educational talkies feature silent-comedy veterans with stage experience: Vernon Dent, Harry Gribbon, Raymond McKee, Edward Everett Horton, Daphne Pollard, and Ford Sterling. Educational's most prolific comedian in the 1930s was undoubtedly the Sennett star Andy Clyde, who made 54 comedies. Educational replaced the Sennett films with star-name comedians.Stardust and shadows: Canadians in early Hollywood, by Charles Foster Andy Clyde and Harry Langdon led Educational's release schedule for a few years and then Buster Keaton headlined a series that yielded 16 popular two-reel comedies.The theater and cinema of Buster Keaton by Robert Knopf For a time Educational maintained studios on both coasts. The Hollywood productions, in addition to those of Clyde, Langdon, and Keaton, hosted comedy stars Moran and Mack, Edgar Kennedy, and Ernest Truex. New York- based talent from vaudeville and radio starred in Educational's East Coast productions based at the Astoria Studios: Joe Cook, Tim and Irene Ryan, Sylvia Froos, Warren Hull, Tom Howard and George Shelton, Stoopnagle and Budd, Bert Lahr, and Willie Howard. Many stars made debuts in Educational shorts: Bob Hope, The Ritz Brothers, Milton Berle, June Allyson, Imogene Coca, and Danny Kaye in New York; and Shirley Temple, Joan Davis, and Roy Rogers in Hollywood. During its last year of production, Educational showcased the young comedy/dance team of Herman Timberg, Jr. and Pat Rooney, Jr., singers Niela Goodelle and Lee Sullivan, comic Charles Kemper, and comedian Harriet Hutchins. Twentieth Century-Fox and its predecessor, Fox Film Corporation, had been distributing Educational product to theaters. In 1937 Fox dropped its line of short comedies and withdrew its support from Educational. Earle Hammons tried to keep his company going while trying to enter the feature-film market with the financially troubled Grand National Pictures. The drain on his finances forced both companies into bankruptcy. The final Educational comedies (with radio and screen comic F. Chase Taylor as \\"Col. Stoopnagle\\") were released in January 1939, and the film library was sold at auction in 1940. Most were obtained by Astor Pictures, which shrewdly timed its re-releases to cash in on certain performers' popularity. Astor compiled four feature-length comedies showcasing Shirley Temple (Our Girl Shirley, 1942), Danny Kaye (The Birth of a Star, 1945), Bing Crosby (The Road to Hollywood, 1947), and Bob Hope and Milton Berle (It Pays to Be Funny, 1948). Much of Educational's silent film library was lost in a 1937 fire at the 20th Century-Fox film storage facility,This film is dangerous: a celebration of nitrate film but the sound comedies survive today. Series Educational also produced animated film shorts. This 1918 short features Happy Hooligan. Like other short-subject producers, Educational Pictures marketed its assorted offerings in individual series. Among these were [Robert] Bruce Scenics (travelogues, 1918–1920), Lyman Howe's Hodge Podge (miscellaneous human-interest shorts; the series outlived its creator); Treasure Chest (miscellaneous subjects); Coronet Comedies (single-reel subjects, 1929–1931 and 1934–1936); Lloyd Hamilton Talking Comedies (1929–1931); Cameo Comedies (single-reel, 1931–1932); Tuxedo Comedies (two-reel, 1924–1931 and 1935–1936); Ideal Comedies (1930–1932); Vanity Comedies (1931–1932); Baby Burlesks (Shirley Temple, one-reel, 1932–1933), Frolics of Youth (Frank Coghlan, Jr. and Shirley Temple, two-reel, 1932–1934), Marriage Wow Comedies (comprising only three two-reel comedies, starring husband-and-wife comics, 1934); Star Personality Comedies (Buster Keaton, Joe Cook, Willie Howard, two-reel, 1934–1938); Young Romance Comedies (two-reel, 1934–1935); Song and Comedy Hits (one-reel musical comedies, 1935–1938); and Col. Stoopnagle's Cavalcade of Stuff (Educational's last and briefest series – only two one-reel comedies, 1939). Buster Keaton Buster Keaton's career suffered a major downturn in the early 1930s and he was fired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1933, after which he embarked to Europe. Upon his return to Hollywood, he made a screen comeback in a series of 16 two-reel comedies for Educational Pictures. Most of these are simple visual comedies, with many of the gags supplied by Keaton himself, often recycling ideas from his family vaudeville act and his earlier films. The high point in the Educational series is Grand Slam Opera, featuring Buster in his own screenplay as an amateur-hour contestant. When the series lapsed in 1937, Keaton returned to MGM as a gag writer.Knopf, Robert The Theater and Cinema of Buster Keaton By p.34 Logo Educational Pictures Logo Educational Pictures's logo consists of a genie's lamp, above which the words \\"Educational Pictures\\" appear formed by the smoke from the lamp.

History Singer-songwriter John Roderick was born in Seattle, Washington, and grew up in Anchorage, Alaska. He later returned to Seattle, where he formed the Bun Family Players and The Western State Hurricanes. Following the disbandment of the latter, he acted as touring keyboardist for Harvey Danger. In 2001, Harvey Danger singer-songwriter Sean Nelson suggested that he and Roderick record an album—half of the songs penned by John, and the other half by Sean. Death Cab for Cutie band member Chris Walla had recently opened up the Hall of Justice studio in Seattle and agreed to help them record. John recruited Joe Bass of Sky Cries Mary and Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne to flesh out several of the songs, and gradually the album evolved to feature only John's songs. After several months, The Worst You Can Do Is Harm was finished. John traveled to New York, where he played solo shows and began to pen new songs. Several of these songs would eventually be included on The Long Winters' second album, When I Pretend to Fall. While there, he was contacted by Barsuk Records—the label that would release The Worst You Can Do Is Harm—who made it clear they wanted John to tour to promote the release. He traveled back to Seattle and was joined by Chris Caniglia, former Western State Hurricanes drummer Michael Shilling and Eric Corson on bass. Thus, The Long Winters were born. =Official formation= Sean Nelson of Harvey Danger offered to sing harmony vocals on a number of songs at the band's first live gig. He ended up casually performing with the band for their first few shows before committing to full-time enrollment. The original trio responsible for The Worst You Can Do Is Harm—Roderick, Nelson, and Walla—is often considered the original incarnation of the band. Roderick and Nelson, along with recruits Corson and Shilling (the drummer in Roderick's previous band, the Western State Hurricanes) are the core players behind When I Pretend to Fall, with Nelson having replaced Caniglia as the band's keyboardist. When I Pretend to Fall was released and Roderick, Nelson, Corson and Shilling embarked on an ambitious series of tours throughout 2003 in support of the album. The band toured North America with Barsuk Records labelmates Nada Surf and Death Cab for Cutie, and later spent November touring Europe. Shilling eventually quit in December 2003, burned out by the hectic touring and lifestyle of the band. With the best wishes of The Long Winters, Nelson left in March 2004 to rekindle his former band Harvey Danger. =2004–present= At the time of Nelson's departure, The Long Winters had recently begun rehearsing with Shilling's replacement for the band's 2004 tours, former Death Cab for Cutie percussionist Michael Schorr. Confronted with a double blow to the band's line-up, Roderick took opportunity to reinvent the band again. An east coast tour with The Pernice Brothers, a more fleshed out European tour, and a nationwide tour supporting The Decemberists that would take the band through the spring and well into the summer. Thus, the leaner three-piece version of The Long Winters was born, featuring John Roderick, Eric Corson, and Michael Schorr. This extensive spring/summer 2004 tour took its toll on Schorr, who left the band shortly after its completion. Roderick continued to do small promotional events and shows throughout the latter half of 2004 and 2005, often previewing a handful of new Long Winters songs. The next incarnation of The Long Winters featured Roderick on vocals, guitars, and keyboard, Corson on bass and back-up vocals, and Nabil Ayers (co-founder of Seattle's Sonic Boom RecordsHannah Levin, \\"Nabil Ayers\\", Seattle Metropolitan, December 2008, p. 62.) on drums. The band did a tour supporting Keane in October 2005 in support of an EP released October 11, 2005, titled Ultimatum. Roderick did a solo mini tour through Europe in May 2006 to promote the third full-length LP, Putting the Days to Bed, which was released July 25, 2006. In the fall of 2006 the band—now with guitarist/keyboard player Jonathan Rothman replacing Mike Squires—toured the USA, after which they joined the band Keane once again for a European tour. The Long Winters began 2007 with yet another European tour, followed by a month of shows in the United States and Canada. In July 2008 the band went back into the studio to work on their fourth (yet untitled) album. In mid-2009 through early-2010, a satiric \\"quasi-weekly\\" 9 episode series by Roderick entitled \\"13 Songs with John\\" was made available through YouTube ostensibly focusing on the work he was doing in the studio.

He was the head football coach at the University of Florida from 2002 to 2004 and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 2005 to 2011. Zook is a native of Ohio and an alumnus of Miami University, where he played college football. He has worked as an assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL) with the Pittsburgh Steelers (1996–1998), Kansas City Chiefs (1999), and New Orleans Saints (2000–2001). In August 2012, he was hired as a college football studio analyst by CBS Sports. He was also employed as the special teams coach for the Green Bay Packers. In 2019, he was the special teams coordinator and secondary coach for the Salt Lake Stallions of the Alliance of American Football (AAF).  Early life  Ronald Andrew Zook was born in Ashland, Ohio and raised in nearby Loudonville. At Loudonville High School, Zook played basketball, track, and football. Upon graduating, he was offered a track scholarship to Purdue University and received offers to play football at several small colleges in the Midwest. However, Zook wanted to play Division I football, so he decided to walk on at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He made the team, and by his senior season, Zook was a starting defensive back and a co-captain for the Miami Redskins (which changed to the RedHawks in 1997). He graduated with a bachelor's degree in comprehensive science in 1976.  Coaching career = High school assistant = Zook started coaching football immediately upon graduating from college, beginning his career in 1976 as the defensive backs coach at Orrville High School in Orrville, Ohio under head coach Mo Tipton. = College assistant = In 1978, Zook began his college football coaching career when he became a graduate assistant at Murray State University. Through the 1980s, Zook held coaching positions with a number of college football teams, serving as a defensive coordinator at Cincinnati and Kansas and as a position coach at Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and Ohio State. Beginning in 1991, Zook served as defensive coordinator for three seasons at the University of Florida under head coach Steve Spurrier. After the 1993 season, Spurrier reassigned Zook to be the special teams coordinator, a move considered by many to be a demotion due to the team's unsatisfactory performance on pass defense. Zook's special teams units performed well enough during the 1994 season that he was offered the defensive coordinator position at Michigan State, prompting Spurrier to give him the title of associate head coach to help keep him at Florida. Florida defensive coordinator Bobby Pruett left to become the head coach at Marshall University in January 1995 and Zook was promoted to take his place, becoming Florida's defensive coordinator once again. However, the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers offered Zook the job of special teams coordinator just one month later and he accepted, leaving the college game for a time. With Zook leaving, Bob Stoops was brought in to run Florida's defense. = NFL assistant = After leaving Florida, Zook served three seasons as special teams coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, then was the defensive backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs in 1999. KC would finish with a 9-7 record, 16th in passing yards allowed, and James Hasty would have 7 INT while Cris Dishman finished with 5 INT.. In the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Zook served as the defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints. In 2000, the Saints finished 10–6 with Zook's defense ranking tenth in points allowed. DT La'Roi Glover led the team with 17 Sacks followed by 12 from DE Joe Johnson and 11 by DE Darren Howard. = College head coach = University of Florida  In January 2002, Steve Spurrier resigned from Florida to explore head coaching opportunities in the NFL, eventually signing with the Washington Redskins. Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley sought to replace him with either Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan or Oklahoma's Bob Stoops, but each decided to remain with their respective teams. Foley's next choice was Zook, who accepted the job. Given the success of Spurrier's 12-year tenure, expectations at Florida were high, and seemingly settling for Zook was not popular with many students and supporters. Others did not understand why the university would hire a man who was demoted as a coordinator on the same staff to be head coach. Within a day of Zook's hiring, one fan started a website called FireRonZook.com that gained national media attention. Many fraternity houses hung banners from week to week either praising Zook or calling for his firing. Zook was head coach at Florida for three seasons. The Gators compiled records of 8–5 (2002), 8–5 (2003) and 7–5 (2004). While Zook's tenure saw modest success, it was well short of what Gator fans had come to expect. In his three seasons, the Gators lost six games at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. By comparison, Spurrier lost only five home games in 12 years. Many of the losses were fourth quarter comebacks by the opposition, causing many fans to question the prevent defense that was employed. Zook did not beat a ranked opponent at home during his time at Florida. Zook was fired before the end of the 2004 season after a 38–31 road loss to the Mississippi State Bulldogs (who were 1–5 prior to the game, including a home loss to Division I-AA Maine). He did not help his cause by getting into a heated argument with several fraternity members a few weeks earlier after being called in to defuse a dispute between the brothers and his players.ESPN News Services, \\"With Zook out, will Spurrier get a call?\\" ESPN.com (October 26, 2004). Retrieved September 8, 2009. Zook finished the regular season, but he did not coach the Gators in the Peach Bowl because he had already accepted the head coaching job at Illinois. Defensive coordinator Charlie Strong coached the Gators in the Peach Bowl. After Zook's departure, his successor Urban Meyer won a national title in 2006, largely with players whom Zook had recruited. During his time at Florida, Zook did have some notable accomplishments. He handed both the 2002 Georgia Bulldogs and 2003 LSU Tigers their only loss of the year. His Gators defeated three highly ranked teams in succession in 2003, all away from home (LSU, Arkansas and Georgia). In his final game he defeated the Florida State Seminoles at Tallahassee, something that Steve Spurrier never accomplished. That victory occurred on the night when FSU dedicated Bobby Bowden Field, leading Gator fans to refer to it as Ron Zook Field. Zook had winning records against SEC foes Georgia (2–1) and Auburn (1–0). Zook was regarded as a fine recruiter who brought a great deal of talent to Florida during his tenure as head coach. Following the Gators' victory over Ohio State in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, Urban Meyer praised Zook for recruiting the large class of seniors who played in the game. Twenty-two of the 24 starters were recruited to Florida by Zook.  University of Illinois  In 2005, the University of Illinois hired Zook to replace Ron Turner as the head coach of the Illinois Fighting Illini football team. Zook inherited a program which had become a disaster since winning the Big Ten championship in 2001. They had only won nine games in the three seasons since, and only five games in Big Ten play. In Zook's inaugural season of 2005, Illinois finished with an overall record of 2–9, and a record of 0–8 in Big Ten games. Despite his team's past struggles, Zook improved the ability of Illinois to recruit top football talent. According to one source, the 2006 recruiting class was one of the 30 best in college football. Despite this, they finished the 2006 season 1–7 in the conference and 2–10 overall. While the record did not improve, the play on the field did as the Illini nearly upset top ranked Ohio State in Champaign before losing 17–10. Additionally, the Illini played well against Iowa, Wisconsin, and Penn State (they lost 63–10 the year before; Penn State led 56–3 at halftime) but ended up losing close games (they were down 15–12 at Penn State until Penn State broke open a close game to make it 26–12). The 2006 recruiting class included Isiah \\"Juice\\" Williams of Chicago Vocational High School, considered to be one of the top quarterback recruits in the country. In late 2006, Zook signed Arrelious Benn, one of the top wide receiver prospects in the 2007 class. More recently, Zook also won over Simeon High School standout Martez Wilson along with Florida prospect D'Angelo McCray. This class was one of Illinois' best in recent memory, being rated within the top 25 nationally by some experts. =2007 season= Zook's recruiting success finally began to pay dividends during the 2007 season. After losing a close game on neutral turf to a Missouri squad which went on to be ranked as high as #1, the Illini ran off five straight wins, including back-to-back home wins over Penn State and Wisconsin. Illinois' 5–1 start gave them a #18 ranking in the AP Poll. This was Illinois' first ranking in the AP Poll since the end of the 2001 season. However, the ranking proved to be short-lived after consecutive losses to Iowa and Michigan. A homecoming win over Ball State gave the Illini bowl eligibility and a blowout win at Minnesota all but assured Zook's first bowl appearance as coach of the Illini. On November 10, the then-unranked Illini defeated #1-ranked Ohio State in Columbus. The Illini finished the 2007 regular season by defeating Northwestern to finish 9–3 overall, 6–2 in the Big Ten. Because Big Ten champion Ohio State played in the BCS National Championship game, Illinois received a bid to play in the Rose Bowl as the second ranked team in the Big Ten. Their improvement of seven wins over the 2006 season was the largest such increase of any Division I team. His success earned Zook a contract extension in October 2007, which paid him approximately $1.5 million through the 2013 season. Zook's success on recruiting trail continued as well, with Illinois having the #17 recruiting class in 2008 according to rivals.com. On November 20, 2007, Ron Zook was selected as the Big Ten Coach of the Year. Zook also was awarded the Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year Award following the 2007 season. After making the 2008 Rose Bowl, Illinois was squashed 49–17 by the USC Trojans, putting a damper on an otherwise great season. = 2008 season = Expectations were high for 2008, but Illinois didn't live up to those expectations early on, as they lost to Missouri, 52–42, in their season opener and to Penn State, 38–24. After a 27–20 loss to Minnesota, Illinois crushed Indiana, 55–13. However, the Fighting Illini fell to Wisconsin the very next week; Wisconsin had been winless in Big Ten play prior to that game. While Zook's team was able to upset Iowa 27–24 a week after their loss to Wisconsin, the Illini finished 2008 with a three-game losing streak at the hands of Western Michigan (23–17), Ohio State (30–20), and Northwestern (27–10). = 2009 season = Despite a very disappointing 2008 season, Zook's 2009 Fighting Illini team received AP Poll votes. As they had the previous two years, Illinois started off the season with a loss to Missouri, but this time, the result was far more lopsided than the previous affairs; Missouri won 39–7. Illinois stomped Illinois State 45–17 the next week, but then they suffered an embarrassing 30–0 shutout at the hands of Ohio State. Illinois lost their next four games by ten points or more (including a 27–14 loss to Indiana, the Hoosiers' only Big Ten win of the season), sinking to 1–6 overall. Zook's team then put together a stunning blowout of the Michigan Wolverines in Memorial Stadium, and they followed it up with a 35–32 upset of Minnesota the next week. After back-to-back wins, the Illini fell to the rival Northwestern Wildcats, 21–16. To close out the season, the Fighting Illini put up a fight against Cincinnati, who finished the year undefeated, but were unable to pull off the upset; and they fell at home to Fresno State in a wild 53–52 game in the season finale. At the end of the 2009 season, offensive coordinator Mike Schultz was released from his contract, and co-defensive coordinators Dan Disch and Curt Mallory were demoted to position coaches. Illinois hired Paul Petrino as offensive coordinator, and Vic Koenning as defensive coordinator. = 2010 season = After back-to-back disappointing years, the Illini had almost no pre-season expectations entering 2010. Juice Williams and Arrelious Benn were no longer on the team. However, running back Mikel Leshoure was, and he proved to be an invaluable asset on offense, while Illinois started freshman Nathan Scheelhaase at quarterback. They started off 2010 by losing to Missouri for the fourth consecutive year, 23–13. They held a 13–3 lead that almost lasted the length of the game. After the early loss, Illinois defeated Southern Illinois, 35–3, and Northern Illinois, 28–22. While the Fighting Illini lost to Ohio State in their Big Ten opener, they gave the Buckeyes a scare, knocking out quarterback Terrelle Pryor and holding the Buckeye passing offense almost entirely in check. Illinois then traveled to State College to take on the Nittany Lions, and Illinois had never won in Beaver Stadium prior to 2010. Illinois handed Penn State a stunning 33–13 loss on homecoming. They went on to win the Texas Bowl in a blowout against Baylor. =2011 season= As the 2011 season begun, the Illini were picked by most experts to finish near the bottom of the newly formed Leaders Division. However, Illinois got off to one of their best starts in history by winning their first six games. After taking care of Arkansas State, 33–15, and blasting South Dakota State, 56–3, the Fighting Illini won a trio of home games by a margin of a field goal over 22nd-ranked Arizona State (17–14), Western Michigan (23–20), and Northwestern (38–35) in a game in which Illinois rallied from a 28–10 deficit in the second half. After defeating Indiana 41–20 in Illinois' first road game of the season, the Illini were 6–0 for the first time since 1951 and they climbed to 15th in the Coaches' Poll and 16th in the AP Poll. However, the Illini lost 17–7 to Ohio State and the season seemed headed towards a downward spiral as Illinois lost a pair of close road games at Purdue (21–14) and Penn State (10–7). Illinois returned home and lost to Michigan, 31–14. On the Tuesday before the Wisconsin game, Zook opened his weekly press conference by warning the reporters not to ask questions about his job status. When reporter Shannon Ryan of the Chicago Tribune asked Zook if he had talked to his players about the rumors pertaining to his future, he walked out of the press conference. The Illini went on to lose to Wisconsin, 28–17, and finished the regular season with a 27–7 loss to Minnesota. With the loss to the Golden Gophers, Illinois became the first team in NCAA Division I FBS history to start a season 6–0, and end it at 6–6. Zook was fired on November 27, 2011. His final record at Illinois was 34–51. The Illini did receive a bowl invitation and they defeated UCLA in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl. It was first time in school history that the football team won back-to-back bowl games. =Back to the NFL= After leaving Illinois, Zook spent two seasons out of football, during which time he worked as a college football studio analyst for CBS and took an executive position at a bank in Ocala, Florida. In 2014, Zook was hired by the Green Bay Packers to the position of assistant special teams coordinator. He was not retained by the team after the 2018 season. =Alliance of American Football= On February 28, 2019, Zook joined the Salt Lake Stallions of the Alliance of American Football as special teams coordinator and secondary coach. The league folded during the season. =Maryland= In August 2019, Maryland head coach Mike Locksley hired Zook as a senior analyst; Locksley had worked under Zook at Illinois as his offensive coordinator and at Florida as running backs coach and recruiting coordinator.

With settings ranging from the Rocky Mountain Front to Alaska's coast, Puget Sound and Oregon, the Chicago Tribune noted in 1987 that Doig wrote of \\"immigrant families, dedicated schoolteachers, miners, fur trappers, town builders\\" and of \\"the uncertainties of friendship and love, and colossal battles of will, set amid the vast unpredictabilities of a land noted for sudden deadly floods, agonizing droughts, blizzards and forest fires.\\" Doig himself would later say \\"I come from the lariat proletariat, the working- class point of view.\\" This House of Sky: Landscapes of a Western Mind, Doig's 1977 memoir, was finalist for the National Book Award for Contemporary Thought. In 2007 Doig won the University of Colorado's Center of the American West's Wallace Stegner Award. Doig's 2006 novel The Whistling Season became a New York Times best-seller. He won the Western Literature Association's lifetime Distinguished Achievement award and held the distinction of the only living author with works of both fiction and non-fiction listed in the top 12 of the San Francisco Chronicle poll of best books of the 20th century. In 2006, Sven Birkerts described Doig as \\"a presiding figure in the literature of the American West.\\" Early life Doig was born in White Sulphur Springs, Montana to Charles \\"Charlie\\" Doig, ranch hand and Bernita Ringer Doig, ranch cook. [spelled Berneta on tombstone, www.findagrave.com] After the death of his mother on his sixth birthday, he was raised by his father and his grandmother Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Ringer. Doig moved with his father and grandmother on a series of jobs, the ranch equivalent of sharecropping, subsequently moving to Dupuyer, Montana to herd sheep close to the Rocky Mountain Front. As a child, Doig read comics, sports pages and magazines like Life, Colliers and The Saturday Evening Post. Doig graduated salutatorian in a class of 21 students from Valier High School in Valier, Montana. [Class of 1957 per choteauacantha.com e-edition 7-19-2017 page 3] Doig earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in journalism from Northwestern University. His master's thesis was on the subject of televised congressional hearings on organized crime. He later earned a Ph.D. in American history at the University of Washington, writing his dissertation on John J. McGilvra (1827-1903). Important first-hand influences on his writing included his high school English and Latin teacher, Frances Tidyman; Sam Jamison, who taught him reporting at Northwestern; and Ben Baldwin, who taught him broadcast news. Doig lived with his wife Carol Doig, née Muller, a university professor of English, in Seattle, Washington until his death from multiple myeloma in 2015.\\"Acclaimed Montana author Ivan Doig dies at 75,\\" The Billings Gazette, April 9, 2015.

Career  Before becoming a novelist, Doig wrote for newspapers and magazines as a free-lancer and worked for the United States Forest Service. Doig served as an editorial writer for the Lindsay-Schaub newspaper chain in Decatur, Illinois, and served as assistant editor of The Rotarian magazine in Evanston, Illinois. The western landscape and people play an important role in Doig's fiction, with much of it set in the Montana country of his youth. His major theme is family life in the past, mixing personal memory and regional history.

History Momentum for a boundary waters treaty built up against a background of difficulties encountered in apportioning the waters of the St. Mary and Milk Rivers in the west, the Rainy River, the Chicago Diversion of Lake Michigan (which at the time lowered lake levels by 6 inches), the St. Mary's River at Sault Ste. Marie, and the Niagara River. Thus at the International Irrigation Congresses in Denver, Colorado, in 1894 and in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1895, resolutions were introduced by the Canadian delegate and adopted unanimously by the United States, Mexican, and Canadian delegations. The resolution recommended to the United States \\"the appointment of an international commission to act in conjunction with the authorities of Mexico and Canada in adjudicating the conflicting rights which have arisen, or may hereafter arise, on streams of an international character.\\" In 1896, the Canadian Government requested that the British Ambassador at Washington inform the United States Government that it was prepared to cooperate \\"by appointment of an international commission or otherwise\\" in the regulation of international streams for irrigation purposes.Harrison, John. \\"Boundary Waters Treaty.\\" Northwest Power and Conservation Council.

It defines boundary waters as surface waters along the international border, mostly in whole, excluding upstream tributaries (Preliminary Article). It establishes free use of boundary waters for commerce and navigation forever (Article I). It grants respective federal and state/provincial governments legal jurisdiction over the use, obstruction, and diversion of these waters (Article II). It creates the International Joint Commission (IJC) and requires future hydromodifications be approved by a majority of the three Canadian and three U.S. Commissioners (Articles III, IV, VII, VIII). The IJC can only provide research or orders of approval if either federal government submits a referral (Article IX). Effect on water resources The IJC has jurisdiction for regulating water quantity, including flows and levels, the Treaty enumerates the following order of precedence of use (Article VIII): * Domestic and sanitary use, * Navigation, and * Power and irrigation. The Treaty applies the riparian doctrine that one use cannot materially impair another protected use. Therefore, many issues of water quality are also within the IJC's purview.

It is wholly owned by Transamerica, a subsidiary of Aegon. World Financial Group associates are compensated by selling financial services products and receiving commission overrides from people that agents sponsor into the company. History World Marketing Alliance (WMA) was founded by Hubert Humphrey after he left Primerica in 1991. The original name was Alexander, Inc. but shortly thereafter was renamed World Marketing Alliance. The original idea was that the baby boomers needed a solution for wealth creation and tax protection, and that the \\"buy term and invest the difference\\" philosophy of Primerica (formerly A.L. Williams) could be better addressed with variable universal life insurance. While in A.L., Humphrey created and introduced the Business Format System (BFS), a business sales and recruiting methodology. Humphrey continued to develop the methodology in WMA. MD TV, the company's private satellite television network, was also introduced during this period. The company expanded its operations to Canada, Taiwan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. The company held its first convention in Las Vegas in 1992. It was attended by about 2,000 associates. On March 23, 1998, WMA Executive World Headquarters opened in Duluth, Georgia. The building housed 500+ employees. In November 1998, WMA was fined $100,000 \\"for not properly supervising its sales agents\\" after their clients lost nearly $2 million in unregistered investments. In 2000, WMA was fined $125,000 \\"for failing to report nearly 900 customer complaints\\". In June 2001, select assets of WMA were purchased by AEGON and renamed World Financial Group, Inc. Humphrey retained WMA Mortgage Services, Inc. and the original logo, which was used in his subsequent companies World Leadership Group and Hegemon Group International. As part of the conditions of sale, Humphrey was placed on a noncompete agreement and could not compete in the insurance industry until 2013. Following the sale of WMA to Aegon, Alexander Wynaendts, chief executive of AEGON, was quoted as saying, \\"When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures\\". World Financial Group has over 3,500 offices in the United States. The World Financial Group Canadian division, World Financial Group Insurance Agency of Canada Inc., moved to Toronto, Ontario in February 2012. In 2008, World Financial Group had over 80 Canadian offices and over 1,500 agents. On July 1, 2013, WFG Securities of Canada, Inc. changed its name to Transamerica Securities, Inc. Provider companies WFG works with hundreds of product provider companies, including mutual funds and unit investment trusts, and various insurance and financial services-related companies. Regulatory issues WFG's stated mission goal is to \\"serve the financial needs of individuals and families typically overlooked by the financial services industry\\". It is yet unclear how successfully the company has managed to distance itself from its more controversial U.S.-based predecessor WMA, associated with fraud, misrepresentation and false statements, and the subject of class action lawsuits, and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) disciplinary action. In preparation for Aegon's acquisition in 2001, \\"World Marketing Alliance 'ramped up' compliance before the acquisition\\". Aegon's Chief Executive Officer Alexander Wynaendts said on Bloomberg TV that \\"When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures. Of course, when you have such large numbers of people out there in the field, it is quite an effort. We feel comfortable that we now have the regulatory issues under control.\\" * In March 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reported that World Group Securities (WGS) had incurred ten regulatory penalties since 2004. * A 2004 NASD disciplinary action report summarized disciplinary actions against WGS. According to the report, WGS \\"submitted a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent in which the firm was censured and fined $15,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings that the firm permitted representatives to act in registered capacities while their registrations were inactive due to their failure to satisfy the Regulatory Element of NASD's Continuing Education Requirements. NASD also found that the firm failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to assure compliance with the Regulatory Element of the Continuing Education Requirement by its registered representatives.\\" * In December 2006, WGS and one of its brokers were fined $150,000 by Missouri's commissioner of securities for selling unsuitable products to elderly people. Other cases of private arbitration \\"where variable annuities were allegedly sold to people too old to realize any benefit before they died\\" were also reported. Utah's Division of Securities has cited at least four WGS brokers since 2006. * In April 2007, WGS was fined $50,000 for failing to supervise its representatives in the State of Utah, who were misrepresenting their credentials and services rendered during free lunch seminars targeting seniors. * In April 2010, WGS was fined in excess of $850,000 as the result of the unauthorized sale of private securities by some of its agents in the State of Arizona. * In June 2010, WFG Securities fined $20,000 by New Brunswick Securities Commission (NBSC) for operating a branch office without proper registration and supervision in Fredericton, NB. http://www.nbsc- cvmnb.ca/nbsc/print_news_content_display.jsp?news_id=227&id;=24&pid;=4 * In November 2010, the SEC ordered WGS to pay, among other things, a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $200,000 for the fraudulent selling of unsuitable securities in the State of California, which were funded using home equity, derived from the refinance of the customers' homes into subprime mortgages. * WFG Securities (Canada) was under investigation by the Manitoba Securities Commission in 2008, after some investors say they ended up in financial situations they did not understand regarding leveraged accounts. The securities commission noted that the World Financial Group \\"did not have adequate controls and mechanisms in place to fully supervise the leveraged accounts.\\" WFG Securities paid a $250,000 settlement to rectify the situation. Dennis Villarin of Winnipeg, MB, a former agent who opened and trained others to open the above accounts, was stripped of his licensing and charged by the MFDA. They noted that Dennis Villarin and his trainees \\"made it appear to WFG's supervisory and compliance staff as though the clients satisfied WFG's requirements regarding the use of leveraging, as set out in its policies and procedures.\\" * In October 2014, WFG fined $700,000 by FINRA for failing to supervise registered reps in Dallas.https://www.investmentnews.com/finra- fines-wfg-investments-700000-60279 * In May 2016, MFDA accepts settlement agreement of $60,000 with WFG Securities for contraventions of the By-Laws, Rules, or Policies of the MFDA.http://mfda.ca/settlement-agreement/SA201626/ * In January 2018, 12 life insurance agents who worked together at the same WFG brokerage in British Columbia, Canada had lost their licences because they all conspired to cheat on their qualification tests, according to the provincial regulator. * In December 2018, 12 former Mississauga WFG agents were fined $865,000 for falsifying KYC (know your client) information of a total of 95 documents, and committing other offences to facilitate leveraging investments. They also failed to cooperate with MFDA summons for interviews.

Its western terminus is at the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The route goes in a straight line for most of its length, and intersects Interstate 49 (I-49) and U.S. Route 71 (US 71). Its eastern terminus is at US 160 and Route 37 in Golden City. The route was designated in 1942, and formerly consisted of two supplemental routes. Route description Route 126 starts at the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The road travels east for around seven miles in a straight line, intersecting Route M and Route 43. Route 126 continues eastward, crossing through farmland and a few trees. After the route intersects Route J, it meets a frontage road parallel to I-49/US 71. The road crosses over North Fork Spring River and continues east. Soon, Route 126 intersects I-49/US 71 at a diamond interchange, and intersects a frontage road again. The route crosses a railroad owned by Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, and intersects Routes JJ and T. Four miles later, the route enters Golden City and becomes Main Street. It becomes concurrent with Route 37. The routes goes through downtown Golden City, and turn slightly northeast. The two routes end at US 160 at a T-intersection. US 160 continues eastward toward Lockwood. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 840 vehicles traveling east of I-49/US 71, and as few as 480 vehicles traveling west of I-49/US 71. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. History The road that became Route 126 was built and designated, as supplemental Route D around 1935. It connected from US 71 to US 160 in Golden City. By 1940, supplemental Route H was designated, connected from Route 43, to a dead end east of it. A year later, Route H was extended west to the Kansas state line. In 1942, Route 126 was designated, replacing Route H from the state line to Route 43. Around 1945-1949, Route H was extended east to Route Z, and the same route was extended east for a few miles east of Route Z in 1954. Around 1955, Route H and D were removed in the supplemental route system, and was replaced by Route 126, as the two sections became connected. Later, Route 126 was repaved in concrete, from the state line to Route 43. The whole route was repaved by 1957. In 1979, US 71 was moved to a freeway alignment, but an interchange wasn't built until 2010-2013. I-49 became co-signed with US 71 in December 2012.

This album became the first charted album credited to Gaye, peaking at number 42 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart and yielding two top 20 singles, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" and \\"What's the Matter with You Baby\\". Shortly afterwards, Wells, who received bad advice from her former husband and manager, left Motown upon reaching 21.

He was a member of the Art Tatum Trio from 1943 to 1944, was a backing musician on recording sessions, and later led his own bands, including a recording session with Charlie Parker. He is notable for playing the electric tenor guitar, a four-stringed instrument. Biography Grimes was born in Newport News, Virginia, United States, and began his musical career playing drums and one- fingered piano. In 1938 he took up the electric four-string tenor guitar. In 1940 he joined the Cats and the Fiddle as guitarist and singer. In 1943 he joined the Art Tatum Trio as guitarist and made a number of recordings with Tatum. After leaving Tatum, Grimes recorded with his own groups in New York and with a long list of leading musicians, including vocalist Billie Holiday. He made four recordings with his own group, augmented with Charlie Parker: \\"Tiny's Tempo\\", \\"Red Cross\\", \\"Romance Without Finance\\", and \\"I'll Always Love You Just the Same\\", the latter two featuring Grimes' singing. In the late 1940s, he had a hit on a jazzed-up version of \\"Loch Lomond\\", with the band billed as Tiny \\"Mac\\" Grimes and the Rocking Highlanders and appearing in kilts. This group included tenor saxman Red Prysock and singer Screaming Jay Hawkins.

J. Dennis, (7 September 1876 - 22 June 1938) was an Australian poet known for his humorous poems, especially \\"The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke\\", published in the early 20th century. Though Dennis's work is less well known today, his 1915 publication of The Sentimental Bloke sold 65,000 copies in its first year, and by 1917 he was the most prosperous poet in Australian history. Together with Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson, both of whom he had collaborated with, he is often considered among Australia's three most famous poets. While attributed to Lawson by 1911, Dennis later claimed he himself was the 'laureate of the larrikin'. When he died at the age of 61, the Prime Minister of Australia Joseph Lyons suggested he was destined to be remembered as the 'Australian Robert Burns'. Biography C. J. Dennis, ca. 1890s C. J. Dennis was born in Auburn, South Australia. His father owned hotels in Auburn, and then later in Gladstone and Laura. His mother suffered ill health, so Clarrie (as he was known) was raised initially by his great-aunts, then went away to school, Christian Brothers College, Adelaide as a teenager. At the age of 19 he was employed as a solicitor's clerk. It was while he was working in this job that, like banker's clerk Banjo Paterson before him, his first poem was published under the pseudonym \\"The Best of the Six\\". This article reproduces the poem, The Singular Experiences of Six Sturdy Sportsmen as well as other information about Dennis. He later went on to publish in The Worker, under his own name, and as \\"Den\\", and in The Bulletin. His collected poetry was published by Angus & Robertson. He joined the literary staff of The Critic in 1897, and after a spell doing odd jobs around Broken Hill, returned to The Critic, serving for a time c. 1904 as editor, to be succeeded by Conrad Eitel. The writer has a poor opinion of Mr. Dennis. In 1906 he founded The Gadfly as a literary magazine; it ceased publication in 1909. From 1922 he served as staff poet on the Melbourne Herald.W. H.

It is composed of very old stars and is very isolated from other galaxies. Its location on the opposite side of the Milky Way from other Local Group galaxies makes it an important object for study. Properties The Tucana Dwarf is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy of type dE5. It contains only old stars, formed in a single star formation era around the time the Milky Way's globular clusters formed. It is not experiencing any current star formation, unlike other isolated dwarf galaxies. The Tucana Dwarf does not contain very much neutral hydrogen gas. It has a metallicity of -1.8, a significantly low number. There is no significant spread in metallicity throughout the galaxy. There does not seem to be any substructure to the stellar distribution in the galaxy. Location The Tucana Dwarf is located in the constellation Tucana. It is about away, on the opposite side of the Milky Way galaxy to most of the other Local Group galaxies and is therefore important for understanding the kinematics and formation history of the Local Group, as well as the role of environment in determining how dwarf galaxies evolve. It is isolated from other galaxies, and located near the edge of the Local Group, around from the barycentre of the Local Group—the second most remote of all member galaxies after the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy. The Tucana Dwarf galaxy is one of only two dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group not located near the Milky Way or the Andromeda Galaxy. It is therefore likely to have evolved in isolation for most of its history.

The bolt and extractor are designed and patented by Robinson Arms, and promoted as offering higher performance over eight lug M16/M4 type bolts. Other features include a folding stock which eases storage space consumption and deploying from a vehicle, in addition to telescoping M4 Carbine style stocks for those who prefer length of pull adjustments; it also has a monolithic top Picatinny rail with side and under-barrel rails, and forward assist integrated into left-side charging handle. Caliber conversions The XCR is a multi-caliber weapon system. The base rifle is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO. Conversions to other calibers and barrel lengths can be performed in 2 to 3 minutes without the need of a trained armorer, and using only a standard hex wrench, and consist of changing to the appropriately chambered barrel and bolt, replacing brass deflector (optional) and insertion of appropriate magazine. .300 AAC Blackout, 6.8mm Remington SPC, and 7.62×39mm are the current conversion kits available. 6.5mm Grendel was slated for release in 2009, but is currently on hold due to technical issues. The barrel retention design of the XCR is seen as a weak point to the design (when compared to the design of the Magpul Masada / Bushmaster ACR in particular), as the retention bolt can back out slightly, potentially causing POI shift and function issues. In addition to conversion kits, complete factory guns in the alternate calibers are also sold. Operating mechanism The XCR employs a Kalashnikov type, gas operated action with the bolt carrier attached to a long-stroke gas piston; the gas chamber is located above the barrel. The proprietary bolt is a three-lug design that locks onto the barrel extension leaving the upper receiver unstressed. There is no need to check the headspace when changing barrels. A steel fixed ejector is attached to the inside of the receiver, held in place by two bolts. The manufacturer claims this design provides stronger ejection than what is offered on the AR-15’s spring-loaded ejector design. The ejection pattern is to the two o'clock position of the operator, with an optimum distance of 15 ft to 20 ft depending on ammunition type and gas setting.http://www.robarm.com Magazines are STANAG 4179 type. Construction The upper receiver is made from anodized aluminum forgings, and is non-stressed. It features a non-reciprocating charging handle on left side which also acts as a forward assist. The quad rail system is integrated into the upper receiver and compatible with most 1913 Picatinny devices. The top rail is monolithic and 17” long, providing a rigid, uninterrupted plane for mounting optics and BUIS (Backup Iron Sights); the 3, 6, and 9 O'clock Position Rails are 8\\" long. The Robinson Armament XCR is easy to break down for maintenance and features fewer parts than its key competitors, the FN SCAR and Bushmaster/Magpul ACR History and variants The XCR was designed in 2004 by Alex J. Robinson of Robinson Armament Co. Production of the XCR-L variant of the rifle began in mid-2006. The XCR-L is currently available in 5.56×45mm NATO, 6.8mm Remington SPC and 7.62×39mm calibers.http://www.robarm.com/XCR_Cal_Conversion_Specs.asp Each of these calibers is available in kit form for converting an existing rifle to one of the other calibers. The XCR-M .308 was officially confirmed via Robinson Arms email circulation to a public reveal at SHOT show 2011. The 6.8mm Remington SPC variant began shipping in November 2007.http://www.robarm.com/News_Archive.htm The 7.62×39mm rifles and conversion kits began shipping in July 2008. In August 2009 Robinson Arms began shipping 3 different sized upper receivers enabling PDW and pistol style variants:http://www.robarm.com/Forthcoming_Products.htm * Standard Upper Receiver - The original length and designed to support barrel lengths from 11\\" to 18.6\\". * Mini Upper Receivers - 15.25\\" long and designed to support barrel lengths from 9\\" to 18.6\\". Primarily intended for barrel lengths from 9\\" to 10\\". * Micro Upper Receivers - 13.25\\" long and designed to support barrel lengths from 7.5\\" to 18.6\\". Primarily intended for barrel lengths from 7.5\\" to 8\\". Variants are also available in \\"California\\" versions which are limited to meet the more restrictive State of California firearms laws. Robinson Armament also produces an 18.6\\" barrel version for the Canadian market, which makes the XCR \\"Non-Restricted\\" which increases its Canadian Market as it is available to holders of the standard Possession and Acquisition License (PAL) without a restricted firearm status, needed to purchase handguns and rifles like the AR-15. The XCR rifles intended for the Canadian market are shipped with the FAST stock (fully adjustable stock) although aftermarket stocks are available as an accessory. Also these rifles ship with a single magazine pinned to accept only five rounds. Since its introduction in 2006, components of the XCR have been updated. Most of these enhancements are available to existing XCR owners. * In November 2006 the firing pin was redesigned and made more durable and robust.http://www.robarm.com/XCR_Upgrades.htm * The first few hundred XCRs shipped with Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) back up iron sights (BUIS). The most recent iteration ships either without BUIS or with BUIS designed by Midwest Industries. * A 2nd generation adjustable gas system started shipping with XCR rifles in July 2007. The 1st generation gas system required tools (a 5/8\\" wrench) to adjust. The 2nd generation system can be adjusted by hand.http://www.robarm.com/XCR_Technical_Updates.htm * The XCR's hammer was updated in July 2008 concurrent with the release of the 7.62×39 rifles/kits. The new heavier design allows the XCR to ignite some newer Wolf 7.62×39 ammunition made with extra-hard primers.http://xcrforum.com/index.php/topic,1237.msg17460.html#msg17460 * In early 2009 Robinson began shipping rifles with an integral winter-style trigger guard and new paddle style safety. A provision for a quick detachable sling loop was added to the stock mount. * A two-stage match trigger is available which will break at approximately 3.5 lbs. This trigger can be ordered with a new rifle or retrofitted to an older one. The older one was a two-stage trigger that was about twice as heavy, and some complaints included trigger slap. As of May 2009, the new trigger has been shipping with all new rifles. * Ambidextrous mag release was demonstrated at SHOT 2010 and is now available. * XCR-M .308 and XCR-L 5.45 calibers have been confirmed for public announcement and display at SHOT show 2011 via Robinson e-mail bulletin.http://xcrforum.com/index.php/topic,9963.0.html * Aftermarket adapters are available to allow the use of the excellent Bushmaster ACR stock on XCR rifles. The FAST stock the XCR comes with is not highly regarded by most end users, and is considered by many the only significant shortcoming of the platform aside from the barrel retention bolt.

Its southern terminus is at I-49/US 71 in Harrisonville; its northern terminus is at I-435 in Kansas City. The route was once designated as US 71 Bypass. Route 291 serves as a main arterial road and commercial strip in Liberty and Independence. Route description Route 291 begins in central Cass County at an interchange with I-49/US 71 in Harrisonville. Here, the roadway continues as Cantrell Road. It travels to the north, intersecting Route P (203rd Street), and past Country Creek Golf Club. It has a brief concurrency with Route 58. The two routes separate after just over . Route 291 is a major highway in eastern Jackson County. In Lee's Summit, it has an interchange with Route 150. After it passes Shamrock Hills Golf Course, it has a very brief concurrency with US 50\\\\. After the two highways separate, Route 291 travels through the main part of the city and has an interchange with I-470. The two highways begin a concurrency for the remainder of I-470's length. They interchange with Strother Road, Woods Chapel Road, Lakewood Boulevard and Bowlin Road. After crossing over the Little Blue River and entering Independence, they have an interchange with US 40 (Cpl M.E. Webster Memorial Parkway) and I-70, where I-470 meets its eastern terminus. Route 291 continues to the north. It has an interchange with 39th Street. It crosses over a Kansas City Southern Railway line on the southeastern corner of Van Hook Park. After a more westerly jog, it intersects Route 78 (East 23rd Street South). Immediately after crossing over a Union Pacific Railroad line is an interchange with Truman Road. Farther along is an interchange with US 24\\\\. Route 291 passes to the west of Winterstone Golf Course and travels to the north-northwest. It crosses over Mill Creek. It then crosses over a Union Pacific Railroad line just to the west of the River Bluff Nature Preserve. The highway then crosses over the Missouri River on the Liberty Bend Bridge. On the northern shore of the river, it enters River Bend. In town is an interchange with Route 210. The highway enters Clay County and Liberty. Route 291 curves to the west and then to the northwest. It intersects the eastern terminus of Route 152 (West Kansas Street). It curves to the north and parallels I-35/US 69 before curving back to the northwest and meeting those routes at an interchange. Almost immediately is an intersection with the southern terminus of Route A (Church Road). Route 291 curves to the west and has an interchange with I-435, where it ends. History The route was renumbered in the mid-1960s when I-29 was opened. It originally crossed the Missouri River about north of where it does now, until 1949, when the Missouri River was rerouted. The county line stayed constant, however, leaving some of Jackson County north of the river. It was aligned on what is now the western frontage road in southern Liberty, Southview Drive, until the mid-1970s, when a four-lane Route 291 was built. Route 291 was designated as \\"Route 35\\" from 1926 to 1939, and then \\"US 71 Bypass\\" until 1972. From 1922 to 1926, Route 35 took the western route between Harrisonville and Kansas City, while Route 1 followed present Route 291; US 71 replaced that part of Route 1 in 1926, but followed what had been Route 35, and so Route 35 was moved east to replace the piece of Route 1 bypassed by US 71\\\\.

Population details taken at the 2011 census can be found under Colwich. Haywood lies on the River Trent, where the Trent is met by its tributary, the River Sow. The village is also the site of a significant junction of the English inland canal network, Haywood Junction, where the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal meets the Trent and Mersey Canal. The waters around the village are widely regarded by guidebooks as some of the most attractive on the network. There are two churches, each of which has an attached school. St. John's RC School was classed as 'Good' in their most recent Ofsted inspection, and Anson CE School was deemed to be 'Outstanding' in December 2011.Ofsted report on St John's Catholic Primary, Nov. 2008Ofsted report on Anson Primary School, December 2011 St. Stephen's Church was designed by Thomas Trubshaw, and became the centre of a parish in 1854. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Earl of Lichfield and other members of the Anson family of Shugborough Hall are buried in the churchyard of St Stephen's. St. John the Baptist's Catholic church was originally built in Tixall, about away, as a private chapel to Tixall Hall, which was owned by the Aston family. When the estate was sold to Earl Talbot, the church was dismantled and rebuilt with a few alterations in Great Haywood. The marks made on the blocks to allow reassembly can still be seen inside the church. There was originally a mill and a brewery in the village, but both have been closed down and demolished, commemorated by the names of the roads where they once stood (Mill Lane and Brewery Lane). Following a fatal automobile accident in 1905, the mill pond was drained and the road straightened. Samuel Peploe Wood (1827–1873) was an English sculptor and painter who was born in the village. He undertook work on many Staffordshire buildings, including the reredos at All Angels' Church, Colwich; corbels and bosses at St. Stephen's Church, Great Haywood and an oak lectern for Stowe by Lichfield. The Stone to Colwich railway line passes through Great Haywood, and the village was served by a railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 6 June 1887 and closed in 1957. In August 2002 advertisements were placed in the national press for a \\"hermit\\" to take up residence on the Great Haywood Cliffs above the nearby Shugborough estate, ancestral home of Lord Lichfield. Fifty-five people applied, and Ansuman Biswas was chosen as hermit. Shugborough also serves as the headquarters of Staffordshire's arts management team. The village was home to the newly married Edith Tolkien, wife of famous author J. R. R. Tolkien, from March 1916 to February 1917.Great War 2003, pg 134 & 231 She moved to the village to be close to his camp on Cannock Chase.BBC Staffordshire - JRR Tolkien in Staffordshire J. R. R.

Herbert Thomas Dicksee (14 June 1862 - 20 February 1942)Art Magick biography was an English painter who specialised in oil paintings of dogs, particularly the deerhound. Prints and etchings of his best-known paintings were widely distributed by publishers such as Klackner of London, and his work is popular among collectors and dog enthusiasts today. Dicksee belonged to an illustrious artistic family. His father was the artist John Dicksee (1817–1905). John's brother Thomas (1819–1895), also a painter, was the father of Sir Frank Dicksee (1853–1928), president of the Royal Academy from 1924 until his death. (Herbert, meanwhile, had one sister, whose name was Amy.) Dicksee studied art at the Slade School, London, on a scholarship. His first painting was exhibited in 1881. Dicksee specialised in sympathetic paintings of hounds, such as \\"After Chevy Chase\\" and \\"Silent Sympathy\\", but he also painted big cats at London Zoo, of which he was a fellow. His paintings were usually done from life; he kept numerous dogs as pets. Those pets featured in his etchings included a bloodhound, a French bulldog named \\"Shaver\\", and several pugs and bull terriers. Many of Dicksee's works, especially those painted during the war, depict the dogs accompanying melancholy young ladies. His most frequent model was the actress Gladys Cooper. The artist married Ella Crump in 1896, and they had two children, Maurice (who was killed in World War I) and Dorothy (who also studied art). Herbert Dicksee died in 1942 in Hampstead. His daughter Dorothy was the executor of his will, which directed her to destroy most of the plates for Dicksee's etchings.

Early life Chichester-Clark was born at Moyola Park, Castledawson, County Londonderry, his family's ancestral home. He was the eldest of three children of James J. Lenox-Conyngham Clark and Marion Caroline Dehra, née Chichester. His brother was James Chichester-Clark, who became Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and his sister was Penelope Hobhouse, the garden writer and historian. In 1924 James Clark, Snr. changed the family name to Chichester-Clark by deed poll, thus preventing the old ascendancy name Chichester (his wife's maiden name) from dying out. On his mother's side the family are descended from the Donegall Chichesters and were the heirs of the Dawsons of Castledawson, who had originally held Moyola Park. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He began work as a journalist in 1949, worked as public relations officer for Glyndebourne 1952–3, before joining the publishing house Oxford University Press. Political life Chichester-Clark was elected for Londonderry at the 1955 general election. He was the third generation of politicians from his family. His grandfather represented Londonderry at Westminster; his grandmother and father were members of the Northern Ireland parliament. His brother James Chichester-Clark was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1971, but resigned in the face of increasing violence and internal Ulster Unionist Party splits. The family were also active in politics in the 19th century and Chichester-Clark's great great grandfather, The Rt. Hon. George Robert Dawson was Member of Parliament for Londonderry, later for an English constituency, before joining the Government of Sir Robert Peel whose sister Mary he married. They lived at Castledawson. Chichester-Clark was consistently either a Front Bench Spokesman for the Opposition or a member of the Government of Harold Macmillan and, later, Edward Heath. He held the position of Assistant Government Whip, Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, Comptroller of the Household, was Conservative Spokesman for Northern Ireland and on the Arts, Shadow Minister of Public Building and Works and, ultimately, Minister of State for Employment. In 1970 he remained outside the UK government because of the Premiership of his brother in Northern Ireland. When Edward Heath suspended the Stormont Government and Parliament in 1972, he asked Chichester-Clark to go with William Whitelaw to Northern Ireland as Minister of State. Chichester-Clark did not accept but later joined the administration as Minister of State for Employment. Before the first 1974 Election he announced his retirement from the Londonderry constituency and did not put himself forward for reselection. Later life Since 1974 he has worked as a director of companies in the construction industry, as a political adviser to the NFBTE, as a management consultant and as Chairman of the medical research charity RAFT (www.raft.ac.uk) and The Arvon Foundation. He has also helped with fundraising for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and is now involved with the development of the Museum of Illustration. Chichester- Clark was interviewed in 2012 and 2014 as part of The History of Parliament's oral history project. Personal life He was first married to Jane Helen Goddard, daughter of Air Marshall Sir Robert Victor Goddard, KCB, CB. With Jane Goddard he had three children, Emma, Mark and Sophia. His second wife was the barrister Caroline Bull, daughter of the transport executive Anthony Bull. The couple had two sons; Adam and Thomas.Mosley, Charles, (Ed.)

It is distributed by Tokyopop. Plot When Yuna Lee's mother moves to Germany to pursue a music degree, Yuna is left to stay with her father, a university professor, and her three older brothers, who are overprotective of her. During her summer vacation, she visits her mother in Germany, where she falls off a cliff and is rescued by Rieno, an 18-year-old knight living in the land of Phantasma. Rieno makes a deal with Yuna that, because he has saved her life, she must become his queen. Indebted to him for saving her life, Yuna is torn between her normal world back home and life as Phantasma's Queen. Characters=Normal world= Yuna Lee :Main character, age 15. She is the youngest child of the Lee family and the only girl. Currently in 8th grade. Yuna has three older brothers who are highly over protective of her. Her father is a professor at a university, and her mother is in Germany, pursuing her degree in Music, which was on hold due to her marriage and the birth and raising of her children. She has a crush on her childhood friend, Kahyun Song, who happens to be her third brother's friend. :She travelled to visit her mother in Germany, during summer vacation, and broke her leg, falling into the gorge at the Neuschwanstein Castle in South Bavaria. She is saved by the mysterious knight Rieno, who makes her Queen of Phantasma. When Spring arrives, she is sent to the queen's castle in Elysian and is introduced to her three Guardian knights. She also meets her main antagonists: Princess Libera and Chancellor Kent. :Although Spring is said to have been brought about by the Queen's love for Rieno, Yuna claims that she will never love or forgive him. And true to her word, it seems that she has turned her interest to one of her Guardian Knights, Ehren. Yuna love for Rieno still remains but because of Ehren's presence she became marvelously better. :Yuna has many differences from the past Queens of Phantasma. # She is not strikingly beautiful like most would expect her to be. In fact, unless informed otherwise, most people believe her to be just some young girl (or boy, depending on her clothes and hairstyle). She often dresses in male phantasma clothes, and once asked the maid to make some modern clothes (i.e. a sundress, hoodie, T-shirt, etc.) # She is more interested in helping her kingdom and participating in politics, rather than indulging herself in jewellery and fancy dresses. # She seems to be the only Queen who has ever stood in opposition of Chancellor Kent. # She wants to know Phantasma and see its condition and its people for herself personally, and would like to make political, economical and educational reforms for her subjects. She does this by escaping the palace with her Guardian Knights (minus an injured Ehren) in the middle of the night disguised as traveling friends. She also commissions to build schools and hospitals in order to improve the living conditions of her subjects. #Her political and romantic situations seem to mirror those of Queen Elizabeth I of the Great Britain in the history of the real world. :Yuna also goes so far as to journey with the both her Guardian knights and all of the other knights of Phantasma (including the infamous Rieno) into the Forest of Darkness, claiming that wherever her knights go, she will go personally, too. Jin Lee :Eldest child of the Lee family and Yuna's eldest brother. Currently in his second year of college, majoring in computer. Known for being responsible and a space case. He also takes on the role of the 'mother' in the family. Hyun Lee :Second child of the Lee family and Yuna's brother number 2. He is a senior in high school, and known for being a flirt and for being self- absorbed. Currently working part-time jobs to buy a movie camera. Beum Lee :Third child of the Lee family, and Yuna's brother number 3. 16 years old. He is at the top of his class, in terms of academics and sports. Beum makes sure that no guy is allowed near his sister, with the reluctant exception of Kayhun. All other guys who showed the slightest interest in Yuna were quickly dissuaded. He makes sure that no one picks on Yuna at school, and is very protective of her. In Yuna's opinion, he is more caring and loving to animals than to any human being. Kahyun Song :Yuna's childhood friend and friends with Beum. 16 years old. A piano prodigy. Yuna's mother used to give him lessons when he was young. Due to a car crash, his hands were severely damaged and he has been on leave from school for a year. It is said that he will never be able to play piano like he used to. His father is the local doctor and owns the hospital. He seems to care for Yuna, but there is tension between them due to Mari Park. Hae Won Min :Yuna's best friends since kindergarten. Has a crush on Beum Lee. She is quiet, calm, and a loyal and kind-hearted person. Mari Park :A very sociable character. Transferred to Yuna's school during the end of 7th grade and after only two months, became the class representative. Envious of Yuna, her family, and her friends. Declares her love for Kahyun to Yuna and actively pursues Kahyun. She spreads rumors about Yuna claiming that she cheated to achieve such a drastic improvement in her exam scores. =Phantasma= Rieno :18 years old (or at least, that's when he stopped aging). A knight in the land of Phantasma. He rescues Yuna after she fell off a cliff in Germany. He promises to save Yuna's life, if she promises to become his queen and follow him into Phantasma. Yuna faints after seeing Rieno slit his wrist to make a blood binding contract. Rieno takes Yuna near humans so she can get her leg healed, but somehow Yuna returns to home country. Rieno begins invading Yuna's dreams to bring her back to Germany. He kidnaps Yuna on horseback on her return to Germany to see her mother, then hands her over to Hermeny to be properly installed in the Queen's Castle, once Spring arrives. Although he is a cold, heartless, and sometimes manipulative character, he shows what could be considered jealous behavior in the presence of the Guardian Knights, mainly Ehren. He is the heir to the throne of Darkness, and will become this feared position when he reaches the age of 19. His mother, Hexe, loved him very much, and used her black magic to make him invincible to wounds, potions, and spells. Ehren Furst :Around 16 years old. Ehren is the son of the former Chancellor Ehren Furst and is the nephew of Chancellor Kent, as well as the Lord of Toeu. He was the first knight to meet Yuna, and not knowing her to be the Queen mistakes her for a hopeful knight. He calls her an idiot, and informs her that she is trespassing on the Hwerusute family's lands. After discovering her true identity, he helps with her studies of the law and the language of Phantasma. He has little faith in her due to her childish and naïve demeanor, and at first thought she was babyish because she would burst into tears and was reluctant to give orders. After Yuna accepts her role as the Queen and falls into the role of the mature, forceful monarch, Ehren shows a softer side and, on more than one occasion, lets Yuna cry on his shoulder and offers her comfort, much to the irritation of the other Knights, Rieno, Leon, and Schiller. However, he forces himself to change faces and hardens his heart once Yuna starts to experience growth on account of Rieno. Ehren loves Yuna and promise to become the best knight for her. He shows Yuna how her cursed love for Rieno will destroy Phantasma and forces her to choose between Rieno and Phantasma. She lets him choose for her, and so to protect his nation and his queen he announces at a banquet that Yuna's growth is due to him and to Yuna's surprise and horror, makes a wedding announcement: His and Yuna's. Leon Per :Age unclear. Youngest of 6 brothers, from the hamlet of Hoch, Phantasma's best arms-producing hamlet, where they have a high regard for brute strength. A skilled fighter, Leon is brash and quick to anger, particularly on behalf of Yuna. Initially mistakes Schiller for a woman as well as getting on the bad side of Princess Libera, both for shooting one of her birds and for being rude and menacing to her while defending Yuna. At the Couple Festival in Hoch, he tells Yuna that he loves her and kisses her after she helps get him to a healing spring. She is only interested in being friends, but he promises to protect her anyway. Leon has been prophesied to be consort to the Queen of Phantasma, but when Grandmother Rehethee tries to glimpse his future wife she sees.... Libera! He and Libera have a very interesting love-hate relationship, they claim to hate each other but Liberia does think Leon is funny. Schiller Licht :Age unclear. A very beautiful man, initially mistaken by Leon as a woman, and cross dresses with great success, when traveling in disguise. Hemel, the maker of the sleeping pill that allows the citizens of Phantasma to sleep through the long winters between queens, is Schiller's grandfather; Schiller is a skillful healer, himself. Schiller is expected to be able to woo Yuna skillfully, but has held back from doing so, so far. Rieno gets Schiller to reveal that he is the descendant of the bloodline of Light (Rieno himself has extremely Dark blood), which is connected to the people of Light, who appear as glowing spirits and are very beautiful and elfin in appearance. Yuna trusts him the most out of all her guardian knights because he reminds her of her brothers. Schiller has feeling for Yuna even willing to give up his life. He eventually gives up though his feelings currently remains but cares deeply for Yuna's well being.

He performed on stage and television, and released three platinum albums. Longthorne started his TV career at the age of fourteen when he landed a part in Yorkshire Television's series Junior Showtime, and rose to popularity in 1981 through the London Weekend Television series Search For a Star, leading to his own television series The Joe Longthorne Show. Early life Longthorne was born in Hull, England, into a musical family of a \\"travelling, Romany background\\". He grew up in the Hessle Road area of Hull, known for its fishing community, and considered himself as a \\"Hessle Roader\\". He attended Villa Place Primary School, St Wilfred's Primary School and Sydney Smith High School. Longthorne came first in a talent show when he was six; his prize was a toy motor car. At fourteen he landed a part in Yorkshire Television's series Junior Showtime, and remained with the show for over two years. He later turned professional and earned a living in Northern working men's clubs. Television Longthorne appeared on television in 1981, through the London Weekend Television series Search For a Star, where he performed as a singer and impressionist. His success on the show led to appearances at the London Palladium and a month-long season at London's Talk of the Town. He played the London Palladium many times. In 1988 he presented his own television series The Joe Longthorne Show. He appeared regularly on several TV programmes in the 1980s, amongst which the notable ones are Les Dennis Laughter Show and the Royal Variety Performance. He performed in theatres in the United States and at the Sydney Opera House. Longthorne also released three platinum albums for Telstar, The Joe Longthorne Songbook, Especially For You and The Joe Longthorne Christmas Album. Impressions Longthorne was known for his renditions of songs in the style of Dame Shirley Bassey. His other impersonations included Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones. Awards The Variety Club awarded him its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007; this placed him amongst past recipients such as Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, and Ella Fitzgerald. Longthorne was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to charity. Personal life Longthorne lived in Blackpool, Lancashire, with his husband and manager, James Moran. Longthorne was bisexual, and had a son, Ricky, from a previous relationship, and the two of them were estranged for 17 years until reuniting in 2009. Longthorne was diagnosed with chronic lymphatic lymphoma, for which he received treatment, around the time of his appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in 1989. He continued to perform in spite of his illness. However, in 2005 the lymphoma degenerated into leukaemia, and he underwent a bone marrow transplant. In 2014, Longthorne was found to have throat cancer, but remained adamant in newspaper interviews that he would continue to perform after his operation. Longthorne died at home in Blackpool on 3 August 2019, aged 64. He is interred at Layton cemetery in Blackpool.

Vaygach Island is separated from the Yugorsky Peninsula in the mainland by the Yugorsky Strait and from Novaya Zemlya by the Kara Strait. The island is a part of Nenets Autonomous Okrug of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. * Area: * Length: ~ * Width: up to * Average temperatures: (February), (June) * Highest point: Vaygach Island is mainly formed of argillaceous slates, sandstone, and limestone. There are many rivers about in length, swamps, and small lakes on the island. For the most part it consists of tundra. Slight rocky ridges run generally along its length, and the coast has low cliffs in places. The island consists mostly of limestone, and its elevation above the sea is geologically recent. Raised beaches are frequent. The rocks are heavily scored by ice, but this was probably marine ice, not that of glaciers. The only settlement on the island is Varnek. Fauna and flora Grasses, mosses and Arctic flowering plants are abundant, but there are no trees excepting occasional dwarf willows. Foxes and lemmings are spotted occasionally. While there are not many land animals on the island, birds are very numerous; a variety of ducks, waders etc. frequent the marshes and lakes. At least five polar bears are known to inhabit the island. Nature reserve In 2007, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Russian government approved a nature reserve on Vaygach island. The island's surrounding seas are home to many marine mammals such as walruses, seals and endangered whales. Ethnography The name of the island translates from the Nenets as \\"alluvial shore\\", or by another account Vaygach means ‘terrible death’ or ‘territory of death’ in the local language.\\"Scary Arctic Idols Around Vaygach Island, The ‘Territory Of Death’\\". 2018. Siberiantimes.Com. Accessed November 27 2018. Until the 19th century, the island was an important shrine of the Nenets people. On the island of Vaygach since ancient times, two idols were worshiped. One, named Vesako, on the south end of the island. The other on the north is Hadako.ibid. There were also polycephalic wooden idols painted with blood of holy animals, primarily reindeer. Some of their sacrificial piles, consisting of drift-wood, deer's horns and the skulls of bears and deer, have been observed by travellers. In spite of their conversion to Christianity, the Nenets still regard these piles with superstition. See also * List of islands of Russia NotesFurther reading * F. G. Jackson. Great Frozen Land.

Unlike related tent caterpillar species, the larvae of forest tent caterpillars do not make tents, but rather, weave a silky sheet where they lie together during molting. They also lay down strands of silk as they move over branches and travel as groups along these pheromone-containing silk trails. The caterpillars are social, traveling together to feed and massing as a group at rest. Group behavior diminishes as the caterpillars increase in size, so that by the fifth instar (molt) the caterpillars are feeding and resting independently.Forest tent caterpillars, University of Florida James R. Meeker, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. 2013 (accessed June 2018). The adult moths of this species favor oak, sweetgum, tupelo, aspen, and sugar maple for egg laying in the summer. The females lay eggs in masses of up to 300, which are stuck to twigs and covered with a gluey cement called spumaline, which prevents them from desiccating and freezing. Eggs hatch the following spring. The larvae can be found feeding on many other species of deciduous trees or shrubs. High population density outbreaks tend to recur at reasonably regular intervals every decade or so and usually last two to three years, during which time trees and shrubs can be almost completely denuded of leaves. Most plants replace the lost leaves without permanent damage.  Description  Mature (pre-pupating) larvae are 2 to 2.5 inches (50 to 64 mm) in length. The caterpillars are black, dark brown, or gray, with broad blue longitudinal stripes and thin yellow stripes extending along each side. The back of each abdominal segment bears a white spot that is wider toward the head end. The sides are partially covered with fur-like long setae. The adult moth that emerges after pupation is yellow or tan with a thick, short, furry body. The wingspan is about 1.5 inches (30 mm). Coloration is similar for males and females. The female's body is larger than the male's. The insect is native to North America.  Biology  The forest tent caterpillar moth is nocturnal, taking flight soon after nightfall and returning to rest before dawn. It is not known how far an egg-laden female can fly, but there is one credible report of this species flying hundreds of kilometers with the assistance of an unusually strong wind. = Larval stages = The social caterpillars of Malacosoma disstria are nomadic and forage as a group. The fifty to two hundred larvae that result from a single egg-mass live together for most of their larval stages. Trails of silk heavily loaded with pheromones secreted by other colony members induce larvae to move, while the close presence of other colony members brings them to quiescence. This indicates that there are social cues that are used to increase the locomotive efficiency of each individual larva. Pupation occurs after caterpillars reach a size threshold that is attained more quickly when caterpillars forage in groups. This is particularly important since delayed development to threshold increases the risks of predation and food depletion. However, as larvae proceed into the later instars, they become increasingly independent and by the fifth instar rarely form aggregations. This ontogenetic change in gregariousness results from an increase in the costs of maintaining grouping due to changes related to predation, thermoregulation, silk production, and foraging.  Thermoregulation  Forest tent caterpillars are ectotherms so they rely on sources of heat from the environment to raise their body temperatures. In order to do this, they bask together and benefit from group thermoregulation. Elevating body temperature is essential in increasing metabolic rates for movement and food processing, so proper thermoregulation leads to an increased rate of development. This is very important for M. distria caterpillars, which rely on fast growth in spite of low environmental temperatures to benefit from the high food quality and the smaller predation risk in the spring. Thus, it is an adaptive advantage to bask in groups. However, as caterpillars grow, thermoregulatory needs decrease and the benefit of group living is gradually overridden by other factors such as food competition.  Behavior = Foraging = Forest tent caterpillars massing on a tree trunk Eating times are variable. Foraging trips can occur at any time and are very coordinated: either the entire colony forages or no one does. A small proportion of starved individuals is enough to reach agreement and start group movement. However, this organized behavior and the high fidelity of caterpillars to pheromone hormone trails imply conservative foraging, which may trap caterpillars to poor food sources even if a better one is close by. Some plasticity in this behavior has been reported, which is modulated by the presence of caterpillars that are behaviorally more exploratory or that simply become more adventurous because they are starved, increasing foraging flexibility. With age, competition for food becomes more important, especially as resources become scarce. Grouping decreases growth rate via a decrease in food intake so ontogenetic changes toward more mobility and independence can be viewed as simple \\"scaling\\" relationships between caterpillars and food sources evolved to increase the benefits of individual foraging in later stages. = Silk production = Large silk trails help increase adhesion to the host plant. As caterpillars advance in groups, they form thick mats of silk that provide them with secure adhesion. Isolated caterpillars have been observed to fall off their host trees and perish. It has been hypothesized that this is due to the production of thin strands that do not provide a secure grip or due to a faster exhaustion of silk supply. In addition to this, making silk is more costly for larvae in their first instars, so grouping is beneficial in earlier stages. As caterpillars develop, they decrease the use of shared silk. = Mating = The first adults to eclose (emerge from their pupa) in early spring are the males. Starting at around 5:30 p.m., hundreds of males fly vigorously and relentlessly in search for cocoons containing females about to eclose. They approach trees and move around them, zigzagging and crawling on branches. If they do not find females with whom they will have the chance to copulate, they fly off and continue their search. It has been suggested that male activity is dependent on temperature, since below 59 ˚F (15 ˚C) only a small number of males are found to be actively looking for females. It has also been reported that females emit a calling pheromone before they emerge from the pupae, causing an increase in male activity around the cocoon before they eclose. In addition, males have been seen approaching and moving around brown objects, suggesting that males also use visual cues to find females. Within one or two seconds after the tip of the female abdomen clears the cocoon, males begin copulation, which lasts an average of 202 minutes. In order to position himself, the male moves backwards and bends his abdomen towards the female, pushing the tip towards the female's bursa copulatrix. There is a significant positive correlation between the body sizes of copulating pairs, which indicates that mating is not random with respect to size, presumably because of male-male competition for larger females. Independently of whether they are or not copulating, females do not move more than a few centimeters from their eclosion site until they are able to fly away, usually at twilight. Females start preparing for flight by fanning their wings. Frequently, fanning begins during mating and is often the first sign of its end as females fly away soon after.  Influence of population density on mating behavior  Forest tent caterpillar populations increase periodically to outbreak densities. Not much is known about the factors that lead to the initiation of forest tent caterpillar outbreaks, although some plausible mechanisms are higher temperatures in the spring, phenological synchrony with their host plants, and reduced predation enemies. Whatever the cause, outbreak densities give rise to cyclic population dynamics, characterized by highest fecundity at peak population density and reduced fecundity for several generations during decline. At low population densities, moths are found mating high above the ground, in the forest canopy. Mating starts late in the day and copulations are short. In contrast, during high-density outbreaks, mating takes place on lower vegetation, presumably because caterpillars descend to forage in less defoliated areas, where they form their pupae. This high population density increases the operational sex ratio and significantly intensifies male-male competition. As a result, copulations begin earlier in the day and last longer in an attempt to minimize sperm competition. In addition, such high densities enhance female opportunities for being selective regarding males. During high outbreak densities, some males, called \\"hangers\\", change their copulation behavior. They do not attach physically to the branch while mating, which allows them to mate longer and counteract their mate's efforts to reject them. This behavior increases the percentage of eggs they fertilize as they delay their mated female from remating and reduce number of potential mates the female can have. This hanging behavior does not appear at low population densities, presumably because it is more energetically costly and more conspicuous, since it can attract more males that can potentially interfere in the copulation process. As a result, males only exhibit this behavior when they are trying to prolong mating to reduce sperm competition.  Oviposition  Females begin ovipositing the day after copulation and do so in one batch during a single oviposition event. Shorter and longer oviposition durations are associated with smaller and larger egg masses, which are directly related to female size. Just before beginning to oviposit, females exhibit dispersal behavior. They position themselves on a branch, spread their wings, and extend their abdominal tip around the branch to prepare for oviposition. As they oviposit, they move around the branch aligning the eggs, forming a ring-like structure around the branch. They then cover their eggs with a foamy substance known as spumaline. It has been hypothesized that the spumaline cover protects eggs from predation and parasitism. Offspring pass the winter inside their eggs. Although cold tolerant, they are susceptible to freezing in extreme cold temperatures, with the risk of mortality varying seasonally with changes in temperature and physiology. Not much is known about parental effects on offspring survival during the winter. The only source of energy for overwintering forest tent caterpillar eggs comes from the parental generation. As a result, overwintering performance of the insect should be viewed in the context of parental fitness. = Predation = Individual risk is lower in larger groups due to collective defense from predators, the dilution effect, and the selfish herd theory. All of these effects provide supplementary protection to individuals in the middle of the group. To compensate for group conspicuousness, caterpillars minimize movement, reducing their chances of being located by invertebrate predators. This behavior has associated costs because it decreases individual caterpillars’ selectiveness regarding food sources, as they will not be able to work to get better food sources. Ontogenetic changes in caterpillars reduce the risk of predation and as a consequence, predation-related benefits of group foraging decrease with time. Moreover, grouping in later instars has the extra cost of an increased risk of pathogen transmission.  Outbreaks  The caterpillars are considered a problem when the larva population explodes in the spring. They can completely consume the foliage of a tree. Trees usually recover from this, refoliating within a month and resuming photosynthesis. Under most circumstances, little lasting damage is caused to the trees; however, the disappearance of foliage is considered to be an unattractive nuisance. On those rare occasions when infestations last for three years or more, tree mortality rates can become significant. Multiple outbreaks in Northern Ontario, Canada, in the 1990s resulted in over six consecutive years of aspen defoliation in some areas. One outbreak in upstate New York and Vermont began in 2002, with 650,000 acres (2600 km²) defoliated in New York and 230,000 acres (930 km²) in Vermont by 2005. Forest tent caterpillar outbreaks tend to recur at reasonably regular intervals every decade or so, with the precise interval varying somewhat in time and space. Outbreaks usually last two to four years. Although the insect's distributional range is quite large, the area over which decadal outbreak cycles are synchronized (i.e. oscillating with the same phase) varies substantially. Outbreak cycles are more strongly synchronized in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Where spatially separated populations are phase-synchronized, the synchronization is thought to be due to the process of entrainment, that is, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment. The cause of the outbreak cycle is not known with certainty. There are a large number of natural mortality agents which could be responsible for population cycling, including parasitoids, predators, starvation, disease, and severe weather. Most infestations subside after one or two years as a result of a combination of these factors. The most common parasitoids associated with population decline are flies of the families Tachinidae and Sarcophagidae.  References  External links  * Terrence D.

The Freedom sailboats have unstayed rigs, meaning that the mast is freestanding and not supported by the normal set of wires called standing rigging. Garry Hoyt, a champion sailor and noted maverick, created the unstayed rigs to give \\"freedom\\" from the inefficient sail shapes of traditional sloop rigs as well as to give \\"freedom\\" from the compression and maintenance issues associated with standing rigging. A known issue with this style of mast, however, is that in rough seas it can break loose, causing a potential holing (pounds through the bottom of the hull). This is commonly due to the tangs that hold it in place failing. The masts are made of carbon fiber and are set well forward on the boat. This means most of the sail area is contained in the mainsail. Jib sails can either be overlapping or self- tending. Gary Hoyt founded Freedom Yachts in 1976 with the Freedom 40. He sold Freedom Yachts to Tillotson-Pearson in 1985 after some slow years. He used naval architects from the Herreshoff design offices for his early designs and in the early 1980s commissioned a 39 feet pilothouse design from Ron Holland. Tillotson-Pearson brought Gary Mull on board as designer for a new series of great sailing, conventional looking boats.

The first was Hi... We're The Miracles (TM-220). It is most notable as the album that caused the first known struggle of Gaye's turbulent tenure with the label. Background Between his release from the U.S. Air Force in 1957 and signing with Motown Records's Tamla label in 1961, Marvin Gaye was struggling to find his identity in the music business. A long admirer of different forms of music from early rock 'n' roll, blues, jazz and doo-wop, Gaye sought to mix the styles of Nat King Cole, Billy Eckstine, Little Willie John and Jesse Belvin, first getting involved in groups such as the Marquees, which he joined following his honorable discharge from a tenure in the Air Forces, which soon replaced the original members of Harvey Fuqua's group The Moonglows under the moniker, Harvey and the New Moonglows, with Reese Palmer doing most of the leads though Gaye did take some lead vocal parts, including speaking in the intro and ending of the single, \\"The Twelve Months of the Year\\", and sung all lead in the song, \\"Mama Loochie\\". Both songs were released on the Chess label in 1959 and during this period the group sung background for notable Chess acts including Chuck Berry on the song \\"Almost Grown\\", and Etta James' \\"Chained to My Rocking Chair\\". After living in Chicago for two years and following a tour in Detroit, Fuqua decided to split up the group and take Gaye with him to help get him work in the musically-developing city. Fuqua then signed Gaye to a contract with his Harvey and Tri-Phi Records and also assigned him to work with his then-girlfriend Gwen Gordy's Anna label. Gaye would do drumming work for acts on Tri-Phi and Harvey including, most notably, The Spinners, on their debut hit, \\"That's What Girls Are Made For\\". In December 1960, Gaye introduced himself to Motown CEO Berry Gordy at Motown's annual Christmas party by playing piano and singing \\"Mr. Sandman\\". Gordy was impressed with Gaye and later began working out a negotiation deal with Fuqua to sign the young singer to Gordy's Motown empire. Fuqua agreed to sell 50% of his interest in Gaye to Gordy, which led to Gordy presenting Gaye with a lucrative deal, which he signed with the following month. Gaye was then assigned to Motown's Tamla label, for which he'd record with for the next 20 years. In the meantime, Gaye met and fell in love with one of Gordy's sisters, Anna Gordy and the couple would begin dating during the spring of 1961, marrying within a year. Recording and release Shortly after Gaye signed to Tamla, the label and the young singer soon clashed with musical direction. While the label was recording R&B; music for teenagers, Marvin, who admired Nat King Cole and Ray Charles, wanted to record more \\"adult\\" music, including jazz and pop standards. Gaye had noted that Cole and Charles had found bigger success recording more adult music, and after seeing that Charles had had success recording jazz music, rather than just R&B;, he felt he could do similar. Gaye, who later admitted that growing up, he was told not to dance, also wanted to \\"sit on a stool and croon\\" rather than \\"shake my ass onstage\\" saying that his voice was what people paid attention to and not his dancing. After much push, Gaye finally was allowed to record an album of jazz standards with a compromise that he'd record a couple of songs with an R&B; feel. Recording his vocals in a relaxed tone, Gaye also played drums and piano on the album while Berry Gordy oversaw much of the album's production. Anna Gordy was another collaborator, co-writing the R&B; song \\"Never Let You Go (Sha-Lu- Bop)\\" for her boyfriend. The album was recorded over two weeks and was released on June 8, 1961. Before the release of his first single, the Berry Gordy-composed ballad \\"Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide\\", Gaye added an extra 'e' to his last name, to look \\"more professional\\". The album was not given much attention upon its release. \\"Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide\\" failed to become a major hit, though it was a regional hit in the Midwest and on the West Coast. The label released two more singles from the album, which featured Gaye still singing in a smooth tenor. His style soon changed to include gospel infections, which helped to bring him success after he released his first hit, \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\", in 1962. Motown Records, at the time of this album's release, was still a fledgling operation, with only The Miracles, The Marvelettes, and Mary Wells as successful acts. Gaye's jazz ambitions continued after the album's release and throughout the 1960s. He recorded three more albums featuring jazz covers, none of which resonated well with audiences used to the singer's grittier R&B; work during the sixties.

The Ursa Minor Dwarf is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, discovered by A.G. Wilson of the Lowell Observatory, in the United States, during the Palomar Sky Survey in 1955. It appears in the Ursa Minor constellation, and is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The galaxy consists mainly of older stars and seems to house little to no ongoing star formation. Its centre is around 225,000 light years distant from Earth. Evolutionary history In 1999, Kenneth Mighell and Christopher Burke used the Hubble Space Telescope to confirm that the Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy had a straightforward evolutionary history with a single burst of star formation that lasted around 2 billion years and took place around 14 billion years ago, and that the galaxy was probably as old as the Milky Way itself.

The development team called it a \\"fighting RPG\\". Guardian Heroes was developed by Treasure and released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn video game console. A sequel was released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance entitled Advance Guardian Heroes. The game allows players to alter the storyline through their actions, such as choosing between a number of branching paths, leading to multiple endings, and killing civilians and enemies, leading to changes in the Karma meter.Kurt Kalata, Guardian Heroes, Hardcore Gaming 101Top 20 Scrollers (Part 5), Game Observer The music was composed by Nazo² Suzuki and Norio Hanzawa. Hideki Matsutake, a former member of electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, is credited as playing the synthesizer for the score. It is considered a cult classic of the beat 'em up genre.RPGamer's Guardian Heroes Review , RPGamer Gameplay In addition to story mode, the game includes a versus mode wherein up to six players can compete using any of the main characters (and unlockable monsters, bosses, and civilians) in a timed battle or to the death. The players earn experience points during each scene, and between scenes are able to improve and customize their characters with six attributes: Strength (determines physical damage per hit and distance enemies fly when the player hits them), Vitality (determines HP), Intelligence (governs size and strength of spells), Mentality (determines how many MP the player has and how fast MP are recovered), Agility (determines the speed at which characters can do physical and magical attacks) and Luck (modifies damage the player gives and receives, in addition to improving Nicole's selection of spells). The game's story mode has multiple paths. The player can choose where they will go and what they do after every level. Different paths lead to different endings, bosses, and levels. The battlefield has multiple levels. Initially, the player can only access three planes of battle: a foreplane, a middle plane, and a back plane. These planes can be switched between in set sequence, or at the player's choosing based on which button is pressed. Often, evasive actions can be taken by switching a plane. Story A supreme being created the universe to find ultimate warriors to hire as its personal soldiers. A vicious battle was waged between the Earth and Sky Spirits (renamed the Earthblood and the Skyborn in the Xbox 360 Remix). The Sky Spirits bestowed incredible powers upon the humans, effectively making powerful wizards for their own gain. The human wizards joined the effort against the Earth Spirits, banishing them into the darkness. Soon after this was accomplished, the Sky Spirits grew fearful and jealous of the humans, and banished them all into the darkness with the Earth Spirits. Mankind instead opted for a more physical approach to life, and the Time of the Sword began. One of the human wizards, Kanon, escapes his imprisonment with the Earth Spirits, and comes back to the surface to get his revenge on the Sky Spirits. There, he brings his case up with the existing khans. Since they do not trust him, he destroys them and replaces their kingdom with a wizard kingdom, with puppet khans to do his will. The former king prophesied, prior to his death, that should his reign and the Time of the Sword be brought to such an end, then the sword would resurface and in turn bring an end to Kanon's reign. As a precaution, Kanon banishes every existing sword in his new kingdom, but he overlooks one particular sword, belonging to a fierce, anonymous warrior who fought to the death during Kanon's takeover. Also, the former princess Serena survives the ordeal, and joins the band of knights to try to bring about Kanon's end from the inside. At the game's start, four warriors – Han, Randy (with his pet rabbit, Nando), Nicole and Ginjirou – find the sword of the valiant warrior. Serena arrives to warn them that the knights have learned of their possession of the sword, and are coming to take it back. The four flee their home as it bursts up in flames during the invasion, then escape the town via separate ways, rendezvousing at the graveyard nearby. The leader of the Black Knights, Valgar, awaits them there, accompanied by a powerful robotic warrior. They are unable to damage it with normal weapons, and Han resolves to use the new sword against the robot. The sword is struck by lightning, electrocuting Han and causing him to lose his grip on it. The sword then floats over to the burial mound of its original owner, who rises up in zombie form. Enraged, he obliterates Valgar's robot, and attacks Serena. However, the five discover that the warrior obeys any command that they give. They resolve that, with this new ally, the time to begin an attack on Kanon's new kingdom is at hand. From here, the story splits into various paths. Some involve ultimately fighting against the Sky Spirits, Earth Spirits, and/or the supreme being that made the universe, while others wind up with the warriors ultimately defeating Kanon, only to have to defeat Super Zur, or various rogue robotic warriors that he had left behind, led by the nefarious Golden Silver. Development According to former Treasure designer Tetsuhiko \\"Han\\" Kikuchi, Fill-in-Cafe's Mad Stalker: Full Metal Force and Capcom's Alien VS. Predator arcade game were the main inspirations for Guardian Heroes' design. When asked why Treasure chose to develop a 2D sprite-based game when video game sales were increasingly dominated by 3D games, and when nearly every other Saturn developer was concentrating strictly on 3D games, a Treasure representative commented, \\"Treasure has built up a tremendous knowledge of 2D sprite know how. It's an asset that we wish to continue using. ... No we didn't think it was risky. In fact the risk is in trying to make a new game. There [are] a lot of companies that have tried and failed to make successful 3D games. Besides, 2D and 3D games can exist alongside each other.\\" For the XBLA release, Tetsuhiko Kikuchi returned to create new artwork and assisted development. When preparing for the project, Treasure discovered all the source code for the Saturn version was stored on DAT cassettes. The company did not have equipment to read the tapes, so they had to borrow equipment from various divisions within Sega to build an environment that could retrieve the source code. Xbox Live Arcade version On May 5, 2011, Sega of America and Sega Europe announced a remastered version of Guardian Heroes for Xbox Live Arcade for Fall 2011. It was announced on September 6 that the game would be released on October 12. The port makes numerous changes to the original. It has been reformatted for 16:9 aspect ratio, expanding the playfield. The game features both original and \\"remix\\" graphics modes and runs in high definition with a remade user interface in both. The remix mode applies an hqx-like upscaling filter along with a pencil-shade effect to the sprites, implements true alpha blending, applies bilinear filtering to the backgrounds and features redrawn spell effects and character portraits. Players can also choose between original and remix options for the gameplay. Remix mode makes many changes to the game's control and mechanics, but does not impact level design or content. Some of these changes, like the new attacking and dodging controls, air dashing, and air recoveries, were modeled after Treasure's own Bleach: The Blade of Fate, a fighting game that likewise features elements of Guardian Heroes. The script for Story Mode has been rewritten and contains updated dialogue as well as changes in name to the Earth and Sky Spirits, who are now known as the Earthblood and the Skyborn, respectively. The XBLA release also features online play for the multiplayer modes, and an expanded competitive mode that allows for 12 players instead of six. Arcade Mode, an endless survival gauntlet, is a new addition. This version was later made backwards compatible with the Xbox One on November 6, 2016. Reception The game was well received. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the game's combos, multiple paths, and inclusion of a versus mode. Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine also praised the multiple paths through the game, but expressed the most enthusiasm about the high difficulty and the three layers on which the action takes place. He concluded, \\"Innovative, challenging, exciting and tough, Guardian Heroes is a classic in every way.\\" GamePro lambasted the game's long-winded dialogue and graphics, saying that \\"these poor, simpering graphics have no place on a next-gen machine. Colorful doesn't always mean clean, and there are plenty of jagged edges, pixelated fighters, and breakup.\\" Despite this, the reviewer gave the game a strong recommendation, describing it as the true successor to the Streets of Rage and Golden Axe series. He elaborated that Guardian Heroes retains all the fun of Streets of Rage's beat 'em up action and enhances it with new additions like multihit combos, linking moves, and a branching storyline with multiple endings. Yasuhiro Hunter of Maximum said that \\"Treasure's first attempt at a next gen game combines everything they do best - frantic action and an in- depth storyline with great character design.\\" He reported that the action and RPG elements are both easy enough that enthusiasts of either genre would find the game accessible. He also highly praised the game's replay value. A reviewer for Next Generation had a more mixed reaction than other critics, commenting that \\"Guardian Heroes may be the pinnacle of the [side-scrolling beat-'em-up] genre, but even the best is still a bit on the mindless side.\\" He remarked that while the graphics, lack of slowdown, and six-player versus mode would thrill die hard beat-'em-up fans, the average gamer would find the game fun but repetitive and lacking in originality. Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Guardian Heroes Side-Scrolling Game of the Year, explaining that, \\"The different characters, the numerous special and magical attacks, the branching story lines, the Versus Mode and the anime style all combined to make Guardian Heroes one of the best, most memorable games of '96.\\" The following year EGM ranked it number 66 on their \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", saying it had surpassed the founding games of the beat 'em up genre. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Retrospective feedback on the game has continued to be positive. IGN staff writer Levi Buchanan ranked Guardian Heroes third in his list of the top Sega Saturn games. GamesRadar ranked it as the 5th best Saturn game, stating that \\"Treasure's original 1996 release remains a wonderful co-op beat-'em-up experience with impressive presentation and exciting combat\\" It was ranked as the 4th top beat 'em up video game of all time by Heavy.com in 2013,The Top 25 Beat 'Em Up Video Games – Part 3  HEAVY while ScrewAttack voted it as the 5th best beat 'em up of all time.

Theodore Fawcett was born at Craven Hill, London, England on 10 February 1832. The son of a colonel in the Army, he was educated at Cheltenham College, and in 1851 was commissioned in The Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards). In 1859, Fawcett emigrated to Western Australia, taking up land in the Swan district. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1862. He returned to England in 1863 and 1864, where he married Eliza Hill on 30 March 1864. They would have three sons and four daughters. Fawcett returned to Western Australia in 1864, farming at Pinjarra Park near Pinjarra until 1882. He was twice acting resident magistrate for the Murray district. He was also the only brandy distiller in Western Australia. On 28 November 1876, Fawcett contested the seat of Wellington, but was unsuccessful. Ten years later, on 12 May 1886, Fawcett won the Legislative Council seat of Murray and Williams in a by-election, holding it until 30 January 1889. He died at Pinjarra Park on 21 March 1898.

Looney Tunes short film directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon was released on May 18, 1940, and stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. The film combined live-action and animation, and features live-action appearances by Leon Schlesinger, writer Michael Maltese, animator Gerry Chiniquy and other Schlesinger Productions staff members. The title comes from the popular 1934 song \\"You Oughta Be in Pictures\\" by Dana Suesse and Edward Heyman, which plays in the beginning of the film. In 2016, it was shortlisted for the 1941 Retro-Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.1941 Retro-Hugos, at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved August 28, 2017 Plot Daffy tries to convince Leon Schlesinger that he should become the new star of Warner Bros. cartoons Daffy wants to be the top star in the studio. To this end, he persuades Porky to resign from the Schlesinger studios to pursue a career in feature films as Bette Davis' co- star {\\"Three grand a week!\\"}. Porky goes to Leon Schlesinger and asks to have his contract torn up. Schlesinger reluctantly agrees, and wishes Porky the best of luck. Once Porky is out of earshot, Schlesinger assures the audience that Porky will be back. Porky spends the rest of the film trying to get into the lots and sets of an unnamed studio, with little success. After several failures from convincing the security guard (played by Michael Maltese, voiced by Mel Blanc) to let him in, dressing up as Oliver Hardy to gain access, (until the guard realizes the real Hardy already entered the studio) and inadvertently interrupting the shooting of a dance film, he decides to see if Schlesinger will take him back. He returns to Schlesinger's office after frantically dodging his cartooned car in and out of live-action Los Angeles traffic, only to see Daffy doing a wild audition to become the new star of Warner Bros. cartoons, openly disparaging Porky. Porky then takes Daffy with him to another room, where he beats Daffy up. After this, he hurriedly runs into Schlesinger's office to beg for his job back. Schlesinger, laughing heartily and saying he knew he would return, reveals that he did not really rip up Porky's contract, and happily tells him to get back to work. Porky gladly thanks him and runs back into the animation paper that he was in when the short started. Daffy, still not quite having learned his lesson after being beaten up by Porky, again attempts to persuade Porky to resign and work with Greta Garbo, only to get splattered with a tomato, which irritates him. Uncredited cast * Mel Blanc as Porky Pig and Daffy Duck * Leon Schlesinger as himself * Fred Jones as animator * Chuck Jones as himself (cameo) * Bob Clampett as himself (cameo) * Michael Maltese as security guard * Gerry Chiniquy as director * Henry Binder and Paul Marin as stagehands * Additional cast members in cameos =Uncredited dubbed Cast= * Mel Blanc as the voice of the animator (Fred Jones), security guard (Michael Maltese), director (Gerry Chiniquy) and stagehands (Henry Binder and Paul Marin) Production notes On this occasion, Daffy Duck is seen as a much more self-centered individual who shows willingness to do anything to get what he wants, whether it was money or fame, instead of being seen as a trouble inducing screwball. This, in turn, is indirectly a foreshadowing of the character he would later become, particularly in Rabbit Fire, and onward. It was also Friz Freleng's first film back at the studio after being at MGM for two years. The film has become one of the better known shorts made by Warner Bros, and in 1994 was voted #34 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.Beck, Jerry (ed.) (1994). The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals. Atlanta: Turner Publishing. *First Daffy Duck cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. *In a real-life parallel of the storyline, the short was directed by Friz Freleng, who had just returned to Schlesinger after a stint as a director at MGM's cartoon division. *As noted, many staff members have cameos in this short: **Leon Schlesinger -- appears as himself **Chuck Jones -- one of the crowd rushing out during the lunch break **Bob Clampett -- another one of the Termite Terrace employees rushing frantically off to lunch **Michael Maltese -- the studio security guard (also voiced by Blanc) **Gerry Chiniquy -- studio director calling for quiet **Henry Binder, Paul Marin -- stagehands also calling for quiet. Binder is also the stagehand throwing Porky off the set *This is the second longest Looney Tunes cartoon ever made in the Golden Age of Animation, running for nine minutes and 45 seconds. The longest Looney Tunes cartoon of all is the 1942 Bob Clampett (ironically seen in this picture in a cameo) cartoon Horton Hatches the Egg, beating You Ought to be in Pictures by three seconds. *Because the animation unit did not have access to location sound recording equipment, all of the live-action footage was shot silent. The voices had to be dubbed in later (which is why most of them were dubbed by Mel Blanc, except for Leon Schlesinger). *To keep the short on- budget, relatively few special effects were used to marry the animation and live action. Where possible, the crew simply took still pictures of the office background and had them enlarged and placed directly on the animation stand. *Despite being in black and white, this short was shown regularly on Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon, particularly during the Nick at Nite version. *In 1995, the film was computer colorized and became a regular part of the Cartoon Network rotation. The film could also be seen in its original black and white form on the network's installment show Late Night Black and White. Availability You Ought to Be in Pictures is available on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2, on Disc 4, on Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2, on Disc 1 and also on Porky Pig 101, Disc 4.

Proponents argue that this restriction in performance reduces the amount of noise when the drive is playing a DVD by providing the lowest rotational speed that allows for adequate data transfer from the DVD to the computer. Doubt is cast on this argument when it's pointed out that the most significant effect is to limit both the reading and writing (burning) of DVD video to the DVD media, presumably as an attempt to restrict video piracy. For example, Riplock does not affect the reading or writing to CD media transfer rates nor does it affect the rates of non video data being written to DVD media. This lends support to the theory that the MPAA has used its influence with different manufacturers to disable full functionality on consumer level CD/DVD drives specifically targeting DVD video files. This slow speed and low data rate hobbles the drives functionality and greatly increases seek find times, general performance and specifically write times (to an hour or more). On some riplock-equipped drives, riplock can be removed by firmware reflashing by the drives firmware (referred to as \\"read speed patch\\" or \\"riplock patch\\"). It can also be disabled on some drives such as the Lite-On model iHAS324B by pressing the eject button for three seconds without any disc inserted.

The station was opened in 1967 and closed in 1981.  History  Honeysuckle Creek – with a 26m dish (now relocated and decommissioned) – is renowned as the station which received and relayed to the world the first televised footage of astronaut Neil Armstrong setting foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969. Apart from television pictures, Honeysuckle Creek and Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (Tidbinbilla) had communication and telemetry contact with the Eagle lunar and Columbia command modules. Much of this was dramatized as involving Parkes Observatory (Parkes) in the 2000 Australian film The Dish. In fact, Parkes received only the landing footage. Six hours later, the first steps on the Moon were transmitted from Honeysuckle Creek. Although the Parkes antenna was more powerful, the angle of its dish – at a lowermost pitch of 30-degrees and buffeted by wind gusts up to 100 km/h – was not in line to receive signals during the first seven minutes of the Moon Walk. Honeysuckle Creek signals were sent direct to OTC Sydney via Williamdale and Red Hill (Canberra). Working for NASA, Charlie Goodman selected the audiovisual feeds from Honeysuckle Creek and Parkes for worldwide broadcasts. The Honeysuckle Creek and Tidbinbilla antennas were built and run by NASA, but staffed by Australians. It was the policy of the Australian Government that the director had to be a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. When Apollo missions ended in 1972, Honeysuckle Creek was redirected to the new Skylab program. As well, it was used for experiments with Apollo scientific stations placed on the Moon by astronauts. At the end of the Skylab program in 1974, Honeysuckle Creek was connected to the Deep Space Network with the designation Deep Space Station 44. Honeysuckle Creek closed in December 1981. The 26m antenna was relocated nearby to the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex at Tidbinbilla, and redesignated Deep Space Station 46. The Antenna was decommissioned in late 2009. In May 2010, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics declared the antenna a Historical Aerospace Site. The antenna remains in perpetuity as a historical site at Tidbinbilla. Today, at Honeysuckle Creek, the concrete foundation is the only remnant of the tracking station. An outdoor display was added in 2001. Honeysuckle Creek is considered the geographical centre of the Australian Capital Territory. Climate The climate at Honeysuckle Creek—as to be expected of its much greater altitude—is significantly cooler than that of Canberra. Notwithstanding, it is rather warm for its altitude and latitude due to the fact that it still lies on the leeward side of the ranges; in this case, it lies in the lee of the Brindabella Range—the northernmost branch of the Snowy Mountains. Annually, it receives 14.4 snowy days on average.

The second LP Gaye released on the label, it also produced his first batch of successful singles for the label and established Gaye as one of the label's first hit-making acts in its early years. Background Following the release of Gaye's first album, The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye, Gaye and Motown were in a struggle to agree with the direction his career should take. Despite the failure of Gaye's debut, which featured jazz and blues songs with only a few R&B; songs, Gaye had no desire to have an R&B; career, figuring he wouldn't get much exposure from a crossover audience singing R&B.; Motown CEO Berry Gordy also had difficulty on how to present the music to the buying public. Though artists like The Miracles and Mary Wells had R&B; success, they hardly were noticed by pop audiences. And while Motown's first signing act, Marv Johnson, was one of the label's earliest hitmakers, most of his music was released to United Artists, while Motown Recordings and its imprints Tamla, Motown and Gordy, had still not produced much success. Early releases by The Temptations and The Supremes also failed to gain national attention. Finally, however, after the release of The Marvelettes' \\"Please Mr. Postman\\", which had a younger R&B; sound that also attracted pop audiences and became Motown's first number-one pop single, Gordy decided to have its artists produce a much younger R&B; sound. Though Marvin Gaye initially didn't want to go along with it, after seeing the success the Marvelettes had had with a song he co-wrote for them, \\"Beechwood 4-5789\\" and the emerging pop success of Mary Wells, Gaye changed his mind and began composing songs with collaborator Mickey Stevenson, determined to get footing in the still-fledgling label. Recording and composition Like most Motown albums of the sixties, this album was produced quickly. Gaye wrote or co-wrote the majority of the songs on the album, often with Stevenson but also including other songwriters such as George Gordy, Barrett Strong, and Norman Whitfield, who had spent the early years of his career in Motown as a member of the label's Quality Control Department team. For the majority of the songs, Gaye enlisted the background vocal helping of a young group named The Del- Phis. Its members were Gloria Williams, Rosalind Ashford, Annette Beard and Martha Reeves. Gordy later changed their name to The Vandellas after the group had been told to change their name before he signed them. Reeves later recalled that upon first meeting Gaye of how shy he was, wearing a hat, glasses and a cigar but had a crush on him as he took the hat and glasses off and began singing. In reaction to how handsome they perceive Gaye, the Vandellas began adding cooing-type background vocals. The Vandellas would be joined in the background list of singers with The Love Tones (who did backing vocals for other Motown artists, most notably Mary Wells), the Rayber Voices, and The Andantes and struggling Motown groups The Temptations and The Supremes while the music was mainly handled by the label's in-house background band, later known as The Funk Brothers. Gaye himself added instrumentation, performing drums on a few songs and piano in others. The songs on That Stubborn Kinda Fellow incorporated elements of R&B;, blues and doo-wop music, while also incorporating a then-nascent subgenre of R&B; titled soul music, which Gaye would become one of the genre's major contributors and popularizers. Release The album was issued in December 1962 on the Tamla subsidiary of Motown. While the album itself didn't chart (the R&B; album chart wouldn't be created until 1965), several of the songs released off the album did chart. The first single was actually the Stevenson composition \\"Soldier's Plea\\", which had been issued initially as a non-album single and didn't chart but was included on the album as a filler track. The second single, \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\", was the first charted single for Gaye, reaching #8 R&B; and peaking at #46 pop in late 1962. The two other singles released from the album, \\"Hitch Hike\\" and \\"Pride and Joy\\", would fare even better on the pop charts, with \\"Hitch Hike\\" reaching #30 and a single version of \\"Pride and Joy\\" reaching #10, becoming his first top ten pop single and was also his first R&B; single to reach the top five, peaking at #2 on the chart, nearly selling a million copies. With this album and its singles, Gaye was firmly now part of Motown's growing hit elite. While not released as singles, the songs \\"Got to Get My Hands on Some Lovin'\\" and \\"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\\" became popular in the UK Northern Soul scene of the sixties as did the released singles. The songs on the album also became extremely popular with the UK's Mod scene of that same time period, and some of the songs would be covered by so-called British R&B; and beat groups such as The Rolling Stones and The Who (in an early incarnation). Back in the United States, pop producers were also impressed by the sound of the album, including Phil Spector, who was so amazed by the sound of \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" that in his excitement, he nearly collided with another car as he was driving. Eventually Paul Young would cover \\"Wherever I Lay My Hat\\" in the UK, where the song became a number-one hit in 1983.

The anthropological concept branches from the observations of animal ownership behaviors. Personal space can be regarded as a bubble with a person at the center, forming an area which the person does not wish to be invaded. An example of demonstrating territoriality might be the car size. Driving a large truck like the Ford F-350 might be communicating that a value of owning a lot of space on the highway. However, driving a small car like the Smart, then might be communicating no need to occupy so much space. Another example is students as they sit in class. Some students like to spread their backpack and books out in a way to let other students know that they do not want others to sit next to them. These students seem to value having a lot of space to themselves. On the other hand, some students keep their books and bags close to them, making others aware that they have no problem in sharing space with other students. The term stimulated Edward T. Hall to create the word proxemics, which refers to how people use space, but not necessarily how people communicate ownership . In nation-states Territoriality can also be associated with nation-states. Government and social ideas are also associated with territoriality. A nation-state can establish common ideals amongst its citizens which lead to territoriality. Nationalism is an example of this. National pride, common religious practices, and politics all play a role in a state's territoriality. An example of this would be the conflict in Northern Ireland. The island of Ireland as a whole and the Republic of Ireland (which has the majority of the island's area and residents) both have Catholic majorities while the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland (which is a part of the UK and constitutes less than half of the island of Ireland's area and residents) both have Protestant majorities. Many Irish people in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland don't want Northern Ireland to be a part of a nation that is not Catholic-majority, since Catholicism is the religion of the majority of the Irish nation and the religion of the majority of people on the island of Ireland. Territorial disputes in Northern Ireland have been justified by religion. This is an example of how religion can play a strong role in territoriality.  Behavioural models  In the postwar era human territoriality was commonly believed to be the product of human instinct, akin or analogous to territorial behaviour in animals.Malmberg, Torsten. Human Territoriality: Survey of behavioural territories in man with preliminary analysis and discussion of meaning. New York, NY: Mouton, 1980, Ardrey, Robert. The Territorial Imperative. New York: Atheneum, 1966.  Social models  Since the 1980s, human territoriality has been instead studied as the product of sociopolitical processes. Robert Sack's 'Human Territoriality' popularised this position, describing human territoriality as a powerful strategy.Sack, Robert David. Human territoriality: its theory and history. Vol. 7. CUP Archive, 1986. In the field of International Relations, John Ruggie argued that territoriality was the organizing principle for modern international politics and could be contrasted with medieval heteronomous orders.Ruggie, John Gerard. \\"Territoriality and beyond: problematizing modernity in international relations.\\" International organization 47.01 (1993): 139-174. Following Ruggie, a number of works have sought to explain how territoriality became the dominant principle of European international relations and/or question his broadly Westphalian chronology of the modern territorial order.Spruyt, Hendrik. The sovereign state and its competitors: an analysis of systems change. Princeton University Press, 1996 Teschke, Benno. The myth of 1648: class, geopolitics, and the making of modern international relations. Verso, 2003. Vigneswaran, Darshan. Territory, migration and the evolution of the international system. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013. According to author Julia T. Wood, \\"men go into women's spaces more than women enter men's spaces\\" . With this in mind, we can understand that men typically have a stronger sense of ownership and are more likely to challenge others' boundaries. People respond to invasion of territory in different ways depending on what their comfort norms are. Wood (2007) presents three common responses: # When someone moves too close for comfort, you might step away, giving up your territory. This reaction is typical of feminine people. # When people have to fit into close spaces, they often look down as a submissive way of showing that they are not trying to invade others' territories. # When someone moves too close, you might refuse to give up your territory. This reaction is typical of masculine people.

Route 138 begins in Exeter at the Connecticut state line in the west and runs to the Massachusetts state line in Tiverton in the east, and is the only state- numbered route to completely cross Rhode Island. Route 138 also keeps the same route number on the other side of both state lines. Route 138 is a major thoroughfare in southern Rhode Island. The route ultimately connects Interstate 95 and the University of Rhode Island campus with the island town of Jamestown, the city of Newport, as well as the Tiverton-Little Compton coastal region. At the Massachusetts border in Fall River, the route continues as Massachusetts Route 138, which extends north into the Greater Boston area.

Before the opening of the Jamestown section of the Route 138 Expressway in 1994, Route 138 came off the Jamestown Bridge and used Eldred Avenue (which has now been partially cut off by the Expressway) and East Shore Road to the Newport Pell Bridge. As of 2005, there is still a Route 138 reassurance marker northbound on East Shore Road just north of the Newport Pell Bridge. Prior to the construction of the Route 138 Expressway in North Kingstown, Route 138 used Bridgetown Road east of U.S. 1 in South Kingstown, then north on Route 1A into North Kingstown, then along an access road to the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge which was upgraded on the spot to the Route 138 Expressway. There are two abandoned temporary ramps at the west end of the Jamestown Bridge used by through traffic in the early 1990s. These ramps connected through traffic to the old bridge while the new one was being built. The new Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge opened in 1992. The Route 138 Expressway was intended to extend west to Interstate 95. For more information, see Interstate 895 (Rhode Island/Massachusetts). Route 138 officially goes from being signed East/West to being signed North/South at the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road and West Main Road on the Middletown/Newport line.

The Städel Museum owns 3,100 paintings, 660 sculptures, more than 4,600 photographs and more than 100,000 drawings and prints. It has around 4,000 m² of display and a library of 115,000 books. The Städel was honoured as \\"Museum of the Year 2012\\" by the German art critics association AICA in 2012. In the same year the museum recorded the highest attendance figures in its history, of 447,395 visitors.  History  The Städel was founded in 1817, and is one of the oldest museums in Frankfurt's Museumsufer, or museum embankment. The founding followed a bequest by the Frankfurt banker and art patron (1728–1816), who left his house, art collection and fortune with the request in his will that the institute be set up. Meyer, Corina (2017) The origins of the Städelschule (PDF). Retrieved 26 January 2018 In 1878, a new building, in the Gründerzeit style, was erected on Schaumainkai street, presently the major museum district. By the start of the 20th century, the gallery was among the most prominent German collections of classic Pan-European art; the other such collections open to the public were the Dresden Gallery, the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and the Altes Museum in Berlin. = World War II = In 1937, 77 paintings and 700 prints were confiscated from the museum when the National Socialists declared them \\"degenerate art\\". In 1939, the collection was moved out of Frankfurt to protect it from damage in World War II. The collection of the Städel Museum was removed from the museum to avoid destruction from the Allied bombings, and the collection was stored in the Schloss Rossbach, a castle owned by the Baron Thüngen near Bad Brückenau in Bavaria. There, the museum's paintings and library were discovered by Lt. Thomas Carr Howe, USN, of the American Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives program. Although the Baron von Thüngen and his wife were uncooperative with the Americans, Frau Dr. Holzinger, a licensed physician and the Swiss wife of the Städel Museum director, was present at the site and assisted with the cataloging and the removal of the items to the Munich Central Collecting Point. Lt. Howe said, “The first room to be inspected was a library adjoining the sitting room in which we had been waiting. Here we found a quantity of excellent French Impressionist paintings, all from the permanent collection of the Städel Museum, and a considerable number of fine Old Master drawings. Most of these were likewise the property of the museum, but a few – I remember one superb Rembrandt sketch – appeared to have come from Switzerland. Those would, of course, have to be looked into later, to determine their exact origin and how they came to be on loan to the museum. But for the moment we were concerned primarily with storage conditions and the problem of security. In another room we found an enormous collection of books, the library of one of the Frankfurt museums. In a third we encountered an array of medieval sculpture – saints all sizes and description, some of carved wood, others of stone, plain or polychromed. These too, were of museum origin. The last storage room was below ground, a vast, cavernous chamber beneath the house. Here was row upon row of pictures, stacked in two tiers down the center of the room and also along two sides. From what we could make of them in the poor light, they were not of high quality. During the summer months they would be alright in the underground room, but we thought the place would be very damp in the winter. Frau Holzinger assured us that this was so and that the pictures should be removed before the bad weather set in.”Howe, Thomas Carr. 1946. Salt Mines and Castles: The Discovery and Restitution of Looted European Art. New York: Bobbs Merrill. Pages 43–46. = Renovations = The gallery was substantially damaged by air raids in World War II and it was rebuilt by 1966 following a design by the Frankfurt architect Johannes Krahn. An expansion building for the display of 20th- century work and special exhibits was erected in 1990, designed by the Austrian architect Gustav Peichl. Small structural changes and renovations took place from 1997 to 1999. The largest extension in the history of the museum intended for the presentation of contemporary art was designed by the Frankfurt architectural firm and opened in February 2012.  Digital expansion  The Städel is currently significantly enlarging its activities and outreach through a major digital expansion on the occasion of its 200-year anniversary in 2015. Already available to visitors is an exhibition 'digitorial' and free access to WiFi throughout the museum and its grounds. From March the museum will offer to visitors a new Städel app, the possibility of listening to audio guides on their own devices, and a new 'cabinet of digital curiosities'. Several more projects are currently in development including an online exhibition platform; educational computer games for children; online art- history courses and a digital art book.  Collection  The Städel has European paintings from seven centuries, beginning with the early 14th century, moving into Late Gothic, the Renaissance, Baroque, and into the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. The large collection of prints and drawings is not on permanent display and occupies the first floor of the museum. Works on paper not on display can be viewed by appointment. The gallery has a conservation department that performs conservation and restoration work on the collection. = Selected works = * Robert Campin, Flémalle Panels, ca. 1428–1430, mixed technique, 160.2 × 68.2 cm, 151.8 × 61 cm, 148.7 × 61 cm * Jan van Eyck, Lucca Madonna, ca. 1437, mixed technique, 66 x 50 cm * Fra Angelico, Madonna with Child and Twelve Angels, 1430–1433, tempera on panel, 37 x 27 cm * Rogier van der Weyden, Medici Madonna, c. 1460–1464, oil on panel, 61.7 x 46.1 cm * Master of the Frankfurt Paradiesgärtlein, Paradiesgärtlein, between 1400 und 1420, mixed technique on oak, 26 x 33 cm * Hieronymus Bosch, Ecce Homo, c. 1476, oil on panel, 75 x 61 cm * Sandro Botticelli, Portrait of a Young Woman, 1480–85, mixed technique on a poplar panel, 82 x 54 cm * Bartolomeo Veneto, Portrait of a Young Woman, between 1500–1530, mixed technique on a poplar panel, 44 x 34 cm * Rembrandt van Rijn, The Blinding of Samson, 1636, oil on canvas, 205 x 272 cm * Johannes Vermeer, The Geographer, 1668–1669, oil on canvas, 52 x 45.5 cm * Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, Goethe in the Roman Campagna, 1787, oil on canvas, 164 x 206 cm * Edgar Degas, ', 1872, oil on canvas, 69 x 49 cm The museum also features works by the 20th-century German artist Max Beckmann. = Gallery = File:Lucca Madonna by Jan Van Eyck - Städel - Frankfurt am Main - Germany 2017.jpgJan van Eyck, Lucca Madonna File:Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins 001.jpgOberrheinischer Meister, Paradiesgärtlein File:Sandro Botticelli 069.jpgSandro Botticelli, Portrait of a Young Woman File:1520 Veneto Idealbildnis einer Kurtisane als Flora anagoria.JPGBartolomeo Veneto, Portrait of a Young Woman File:Rembrandt_-_The_Blinding_of_Samson_-_WGA19097.jpgRembrandt Harmensz van Rijn, The Blinding of Samson File:Jan Vermeer van Delft 009.jpgJohannes Vermeer, The Geographer File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpgJohann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, Goethe in the Roman Campagna File:Edgar Degas - Orchestra Musicians - Google Art Project.jpgEdgar Degas, ''''  Directors  The directors of the Städel Museum: * Carl Friedrich Wendelstadt 1817–1840 * Philipp Veit 1830–1843 * Johann David Passavant 1840–1861 * Gerhard Malß 1861–1885 * Georg Kohlbacher 1885–1889 * Henry Thode 1889–1891 * Heinrich Weizsäcker 1891–1904 * Ludwig Justi 1904–1905 * Georg Swarzenski 1906–1937 * Ernst Holzinger 1938–1972 * Klaus Gallwitz 1974–1994 * Herbert Beck 1994–2006 * Max Hollein 2006–2016 * Philipp Demandt since 2016  See also  * Städelschule * Museumsufer * List of museums in Germany * List of art museums  Literature  * Eva Mongi- Vollmer: Meisterwerke im Städel Museum.

His best-selling album of the 1960s, it became Gaye's first solo album to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, peaking at No. 33, and also became his first No. 1 album on the Soul Albums Chart. Three Top 40 hits were released from the album. The title matches the initials of Gaye's full name, Marvin Pentz Gay. Production Norman Whitfield provided the compositions \\"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\\" (originally recorded by labelmates The Temptations), \\"That's The Way Love Is\\" (originally recorded by The Isley Brothers) and a cover of Gladys Knight and the Pips' \\"The End of Our Road\\". The singles \\"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\\", the longest-running #1 hit on the R&B; charts in 1969 and a #4 Pop hit, and \\"That's The Way Love Is\\" (#2 and #7 on the soul and pop charts, respectively) became consecutive million-sellers. These records were among Whitfield's many psychedelic soul productions of the time, and recalled the arrangement of Gaye's #1 hit \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\". Release and reception Released on April 30, 1969, the album became Gaye's first solo album to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, peaking at #33, and also became his first #1 album on the Top Soul Albums chart. The album was moderately received on release, and remains overlooked, though Ron Wynn in a retrospective review for AllMusic, felt the album contains \\"some outstanding songs\\". In a contemporary review (23 August 1969), Jack Egan in Rolling Stone felt that Gaye did not \\"aim for spectacular effects\\", but that the album \\"treats the listener to the same infectious music and subtly varied singing\\" of Gaye's previous successful singles.

On a film set with a plantation background, Jolson in blackface sings three of his hit songs: \\"April Showers\\", \\"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody\\", and \\"When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)\\". The film presents him as if in a live stage performance, complete with three curtain calls at the finish. Its premiere took place on October 7, 1926, at the Colony Theatre, New York, where it concluded a program of short subjects that accompanied Warner Brothers' second feature-length Vitaphone film The Better 'Ole. The \\"Intermission\\" card which appears at its end derives from that use. Critics praised A Plantation Act as the hit of the show.Vitaphone News, vol.2 no.2 (Fall/Winter-1994). Retrieved April 5, 2016. The short was long believed to be a lost film, and its unavailability fueled the misconception that Jolson's first sound film was the famous feature-length milestone The Jazz Singer, which premiered almost exactly one year later. A mute print of A Plantation Act was eventually found in the Library of Congress, mislabeled as a preview for The Jazz Singer. A copy of the corresponding soundtrack disc also came to light, but it had been broken into four pieces and glued back together so imperfectly that it would not play through. After some careful surgery, restoration technicians succeeded in making a usable dub from the disc and digitally removing the pops and clicks resulting from the damage. The restored film was included on a LaserDisc published in the 1990s and as a bonus feature on the 2007 3-disc DVD release of The Jazz Singer.

The score is dedicated to King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia.  Structure  The work is in three movements: # Allegro moderato # Preghiera: Larghetto # Rondo: Allegro giocoso A typical performance takes around 28 - 30 minutes. Analysis The first movement has two contrasting themes, the first in dotted rhythm and initially hesitant and the second in B major (begun by the cellos), wide-ranging and expressive. These are, in turn, dissected and ornamented by the soloist with formidable virtuosity, using multiple-stopping and harmonics and, notably in the cadenza, the extreme upper register of the violin. The second movement, Preghiera (Prayer), is a short lyrical interlude in A major, with the orchestra woodwinds and horns given much prominence. It leads into the concluding Rondo, a colourful and vivacious piece with a contrasting episode in B major and demanding bravura playing, but without the first movement's extreme pyrotechnics (suggesting that it was composed earlier).

Geotextile sandbags can be ca. 20 m long, such as those used for the artificial reef at Narrow Neck, Queensland. Geotextiles are permeable fabrics which, when used in association with soil, have the ability to separate, filter, reinforce, protect, or drain. Typically made from polypropylene or polyester, geotextile fabrics come in three basic forms: woven (resembling mail bag sacking), needle punched (resembling felt), or heat bonded (resembling ironed felt). Geotextile composites have been introduced and products such as geogrids and meshes have been developed. Geotextiles are able to withstand many things, are durable, and are able to soften a fall if someone falls down. Overall, these materials are referred to as geosynthetics and each configuration—geonets, geosynthetic clay liners, geogrids, geotextile tubes, and others—can yield benefits in geotechnical and environmental engineering design. History Geotextiles were originally intended to be an alternative to granular soil filters. The original, and still sometimes used, term for geotextiles is filter fabrics. Work originally began in the 1950s with R.J. Barrett using geotextiles behind precast concrete seawalls, under precast concrete erosion control blocks, beneath large stone riprap, and in other erosion control situations.Barrett, R. J., \\"Use of Plastic Filters in Coastal Structures,\\" Proceedings from the 16th International Conference Coastal Engineers, Tokyo, September 1966, pp. 1048–1067 He used different styles of woven monofilament fabrics, all characterized by a relatively high percentage open area (varying from 6 to 30%). He discussed the need for both adequate permeability and soil retention, along with adequate fabric strength and proper elongation and set the tone for geotextile use in filtration situations. Applications A silt fence on a construction site. Geotextiles and related products have many applications and currently support many civil engineering applications including roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, bank protection, coastal engineering and construction site silt fences or geotube. Usually geotextiles are placed at the tension surface to strengthen the soil. Geotextiles are also used for sand dune armoring to protect upland coastal property from storm surge, wave action and flooding. A large sand-filled container (SFC) within the dune system prevents storm erosion from proceeding beyond the SFC. Using a sloped unit rather than a single tube eliminates damaging scour. Erosion control manuals comment on the effectiveness of sloped, stepped shapes in mitigating shoreline erosion damage from storms. Geotextile sand-filled units provide a \\"soft\\" armoring solution for upland property protection. Geotextiles are used as matting to stabilize flow in stream channels and swales. pp. 73–74. Geotextiles can improve soil strength at a lower cost than conventional soil nailing. In addition, geotextiles allow planting on steep slopes, further securing the slope. Geotextiles have been used to protect the fossil hominid footprints of Laetoli in Tanzania from erosion, rain, and tree roots.Renfrew, Colin and Paul Bahn, Archaeology. 4th ed. New York: Thames 2004. . In building demolition, geotextile fabrics in combination with steel wire fencing can contain explosive debris. Coir (coconut fiber) geotextiles are popular for erosion control, slope stabilization and bioengineering, due to the fabric's substantial mechanical strength. Coir geotextiles last approximately 3 to 5 years depending on the fabric weight. The product degrades into humus, enriching the soil. Design methods While many possible design methods or combinations of methods are available to the geotextile designer, the ultimate decision for a particular application usually takes one of three directions: design by cost and availability, design by specification, or design by function. Extensive literature on design methods for geotextiles has been published in the peer reviewed journal Geotextiles and Geomembranes. =See also= *Hard landscape materials *Sediment control *Geomembrane ReferencesFurther reading * Koerner, R.

The album's plan was to establish the singer as a strong albums-oriented artist, as well as a hit maker, although Gaye was still uncomfortable with performing strictly R&B.; He had begun work on a standards album around this time after meeting musician Bobby Scott. However, sessions were unsuccessful. Gaye would successfully complete a standards album only in his later years, an album which would be released posthumously (That album would be Vulnerable released in 1997).

Severn joined the colonial civil service in British Malaya in 1894 and worked under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1912, he became Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong and remained in the post until 1925. During this period, Severn governed Hong Kong twice as acting administrator during transition periods between Governors. Early life Sir Claud Severn was born on 9 September 1869 in Adelaide, South Australia, to Walter Severn (1830－1904) (at one time British Consul in Rome) and Mary Dalrymple Fergusson (1845-1916). His mother was the daughter of Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, 5th Baronet. Severn went to St Peter's College, Adelaide and studied Latin and chemistry at the University of Adelaide.\\"Severn, Sir Claud\\", Who Was Who, London: A & C Black, 1996. He later graduated from Selwyn College, University of Cambridge with a BA in 1890 and MA in 1913. Colonial service Having joined the Foreign Service in 1891 as a temporary library clerk, Severn was appointed, in 1894, private secretary to Sir Charles B H Mitchell, then Governor of the Straits Settlements. After a period of 17 years in the colonial administration of the Federated Malay States including four years as private secretary to Governor Sir John Anderson, he was appointed Colonial Secretary in Hong Kong, leading the administration under Governor Sir Frederick Lugard. He was acting governor of Hong Kong for just over a year during a transition between governors from 1918 to 1919. It was 1918 when he entertained the visiting George Morrison, the highly influential Political Advisor to the President of the Chinese Republic, who related that the appointment of the \\"Buffoon of Hong Kong\\" was \\"one of the jokes of our time\\". In 1920, at 50, he married Margaret Annie Bullock and they had two sons and a daughter. Both Severn and Governor Sir Reginald Stubbs retired in 1925, victims of the general strike which all but destroyed Hong Kong that year and for which they were criticised by James Jamieson, British Consul General in Canton. Jamieson saw them as out of touch and out of date, unable to converse in Chinese and ignorant of republican China. Later life After his service in Hong Kong, Severn departed for Britain and died at the Old Rectory, Ewelme, near Oxford, on 8 April 1933. Memory Severn Road, which is located on Mount Gough in Hong Kong, was named after him.

It was published in 1879, inscribed to his dear friend Pablo de Sarasate. The work is in three movements: # Allegro moderato in D minor/F major # Romance: Andante non troppo in B flat major # Allegro con fuoco – Allegro moderato (à la Zingara) in D minor/D major Written during the relatively stable period of Wieniawski’s residence in St Petersburg, the second Violin Concerto in D minor, op.22 is generally considered as his finest work. Richly melodic and highly idiomatic the work balances the elements of style dispassionately and serenely. Wieniawski first played the work in St Petersburg on 27 November 1862 under the baton of Anton Rubinstein. Both main elements of the first movement, its sombre, restless first subject, and its lyrical pendant (begun by a solo horn) are discussed freely and subject to dazzling embellishments by the solo violin. This movement includes a demanding variety of technique, including chromatic glissandi, double stops, arpeggios, sixths, octaves, thirds, chromatic scales, and artificial harmonics, not to mention a myriad of bowing techniques. The beat is based on a 4/4 or common time. The first movement uses a half-sonata form where the orchestral coda after the exposition transitions into the second movement instead of a development section. The slow movement, a Romance, follows without a break. It is based on a lilting tune in 12/8 time and rises to an impassioned central climax. A rhapsodic passage marked Allegro con fuoco and mainly a solo cadenza, leads to the finale, a dashing rondo in the gypsy style, which quotes the first movement's subsidiary theme in the course of its second and third episodes. The final movement implements a 2/4 time, which allows the violinists to emphasize certain notes in the beginning of some measures. Wieniawski's second Violin Concerto remains one of the most popular violin concertos of the Romantic era, memorable for its lush and moving melodies and harmonies. Instrumentation The concerto is scored for solo violin and an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones (alto, tenor and bass), timpani, and strings.

CBN broadcasts with 10,000 watts, unlike most other clear-channel, Class A stations, which broadcast with 50,000 watts. Per international agreement (NARBA), CBN is grandfathered at 10 kW and Class A, whereas the dominant station on this frequency throughout the Americas is KFI Los Angeles, which operates with 50 kW and Class A. CBN also broadcasts at 88.5 FM in the St. John's area.  History  The station began broadcasting at 8 p.m. on November 14, 1932 as VONF (Voice Of NewFoundland), broadcasting at 1195 kHz, and was owned and operated by the Dominion Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of the Avalon Telephone Company (a predecessor of Bell Aliant).\\"North American B.C. Stations By Calls\\", Radio Index. December 1935. p. 103. Retrieved June 20, 2019. In 1934, it merged with a former competitor, VOGY 840, which had also launched in 1932. The VONF call sign was retained. On March 13, 1939, the Dominion Broadcasting Company was absorbed by the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland, the pre- Confederation public broadcaster, as its first radio station. The frequency was eventually changed to its current 640 AM. BCN was absorbed by the CBC on March 31, 1949 when Newfoundland joined Canada. The call sign was then changed to CBN. CBN used to operate 10,000-watt rebroadcaster CBNM in Marystown on 740 AM (previously 570), but this station was converted to 90.3 FM in the 1980s. CBN is currently the largest Radio One station in eastern Canada that is still located on the AM band, along with CBY in Corner Brook, which also operates at 10,000 watts and has clear channel designation. CBN's daytime signal covers much of the Avalon Peninsula, at night, it reaches much of the eastern half of North America. Until April 27, 2007, CBN's operations were located on 342 Duckworth Street. Those operations are currently located on 95 University Avenue, where the television operations are also based.  Local programming  The station's local shows include The St. John's Morning Show with Krissy Holmes and Ramraajh Sharvendiran, Cross Talk with Ramona Dearing, On The Go with Ted Blades, The Fisheries Broadcast with Jane Adey, and Weekend AM with Heather Barrett. For all intents and purposes, the province's other five Radio One stations (CBG Gander, CBT Grand Falls-Windsor, CBY Corner Brook, CFGB-FM Happy Valley-Goose Bay and CBDQ-FM Labrador City) are semi-satellites of CBN, simulcasting most of CBN's local programming (other than the morning show on weekdays) during Radio One's local programming blocks. One of the station's most popular shows in the 1930s and 1940s was The Barrelman, hosted by future Premier Joey Smallwood. =Shortwave relay= By 1940, VONF operated a shortwave relay for remote areas of Newfoundland using the call sign VONG and operating on a frequency of 9.47 MHz (later 9.48, both in the 31-meter band). A second frequency of 5.98 MHz (later 5.97, both in the 49-meter band) was launched using the call sign VONH. Eventually, VONG left the air and only VONH remained. The call sign changed to CBNX in 1949 when the AM station became CBN. The frequency was changed to 6.16 MHz in 1963. In 1965, the call sign was changed to CKZN, recognizing that, technically, the CB call sign prefix was assigned to Chile on an international basis. In 1989, the shortwave relay began to rebroadcast CFGB-FM in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, part-time as well as CBN. Eventually, in 1994, the station no longer relayed CBN, and became a full-time rebroadcaster of CFGB-FM. Most of Newfoundland had reliable AM or FM reception by that time, so the relay's main use was now limited to the remote areas of Labrador. Rebroadcasters CBN has the following rebroadcasters: CBND was used by a former low-power AM rebroadcasting transmitter in Flower's Cove, which had operated at 790 kHz in 1972 to rebroadcast the programming of CBN.Communication World Spring-Summer 1972 - Canada's Low-power Relay Transmitters - see page 47. In 1968, CBND was approved to move from 600 to 920 kHz according to the Canadian Communications Foundation's CBN website. Its unknown when CBND signed on and when it left the air, however, there's a CBND- FM currently operating at 105.1 MHz in Postville which rebroadcasts CFGB-FM Happy Valley-Goose Bay. CIBB-FM rebroadcasts programming of CBN, although it is owned by the Burgeo Broadcasting System.Decision CRTC 89-423 In March 2016, The CBC made the decision to put a nested rebroadcaster in St. John's. It would broadcast at 88.5 MHz with an ERP of 3,612 Watts. On July 5, 2016, the station went on-air for testing. On August 1, 2016, the CRTC approved the decision to put a nested rebroadcaster in St. John's. CBN-1-FM began broadcasting on October 28, 2016.

Since 2016, it has also served as the headquarters of Bor Municipality. The city is situated on the east side of the White Nile (Bahr al Jabal River) at the southern extent of the sudd, South Sudan's vast central wetlands. History Bor is located on the site of a fishing village on the White Nile (Bahr al Jabal River), where an ivory-and-slave trading depot was established in the 1860s. It grew into a regional hub of the slave-and-ivory trade during the late nineteenth-century. In 1874, Charles George Gordon established a government station there under the Turkiyah Government. In the early years of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Bor was a \\"wooding station\\" for steamers travelling along the White Nile (Bahr al Jabal River). In 1905, Bor was established as the headquarters of the Bor-Duk District. Bor is of historical importance to the people of South Sudan. It was in Malek, a small settlement about south of Bor, that one of the first modern Christian missions in present-day South Sudan was established by Archibald Shaw in 1906. Bor became the first area to host a Church Missionary Society station in 1906. Malek was turned into a missionary stronghold in the Upper Nile Region. Shaw opened the first primary school in Malek. This school produced the first indigenous Anglican bishop to be consecrated in Dinkaland, Rt. Rev. Daniel Deng Atong, followed the Nikonora Achiek Deng Ariir. John Aruor became the first legend to be baptized in 1916 in Bor. Bor became an administrative centre under the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899–1956) for the Dinka people. Bor is the epicenter of the Second Sudanese Civil War. Dr. John Garang De Mabior, an officer in the Sudanese Army led a revolt in the town of Bor, in May 1983, leading to the birth of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement and Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA). Bor was also the scene of the 1991 Bor massacre, where approximately 2,000 people were killed. Eventually South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011. Following the 2013 South Sudanese coup d'état attempt, Bor was contested in several weeks of combat between the national army and rebels led by Riek Machar. A portion of the Nuer White Army joined the fighting as well. In 2016, Bor was designated as the seat of Bor Municipality. The same order sub-divided the former Bor County into five smaller counties, each containing a single payam. These new counties were Bor South County (Kolnyang payam), Bor East County (Anyidi Payam), Bor Central county (Makuach Payam), Bor West County (Baidit Payam), and Bor North County (Jalle Payam). Geography An aerial view of the extreme east edge of Bor (at the airport) looking South The town of Mading-Bor is Jonglei State's capital city, in central South Sudan, approximately , by road, north of Juba, the capital and largest city in the country. The town is located on the east bank of the White Nile. Climate Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw). Population The 2008 population of Bor Payam was reported by the National Bureau of Statistics to be 61,716. Economy Kenya Commercial Bank (South Sudan) maintains a branch in Bor.Branches of KCB South Sudan Education The John Garang Memorial University of Science and Technology, one of the seven public universities in the country, is located in Bor. The university is named after John Garang de Mabior (June 23, 1945 – July 30, 2005). Garang is considered the founder of modern South Sudan having led the South Sudanese movement Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement. He signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, an event which culminated in the independence of South Sudan in 2011. Garang died in a helicopter crash in 2005, 21 days following his swearing in as the first Vice President of Sudan and President of the Autonomous South Sudan. The John Garang Memorial University of Science and Technology was founded by the former governor of Jonglei State, Mr. Philip Thon Leek. Cathedral Bor is also the seat of an Anglican Diocese in the Episcopal Church of Sudan. Transportation Bor is also served by Bor Airport, in addition to river traffic on the White Nile and three major roads that lead out of town.

As the soundtrack to the 1972 Blaxploitation film of the same name, the Trouble Man soundtrack was a more contemporary move for Gaye, following his politically charged album What's Going On. This was the first album to be written and produced solely by Gaye. The only other album recorded under his full creative control was In Our Lifetime, released in 1981. Recording Following the success of What's Going On, Marvin Gaye had not only won creative control, but a renewed $1 million contract with Motown subsidiary Tamla had made the musician the most profitable R&B; artist of all time. Signing the contract in early 1972, Gaye sought to take advantage of his opportunities. Bolstered by the successes of film soundtracks such as Shaft and Superfly, Motown offered the musician a chance to compose his own film soundtrack after winning rights to produce the crime thriller, Trouble Man. Unlike Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield, who mixed social commentary with sexual songs in their respective soundtracks, Gaye chose to focus primarily on the film's character, \\"Mister T\\", producing and composing both the film's score while entirely producing the film's soundtrack, which was recorded at Motown Studios (or \\"Hitsville West\\") in Hollywood. Following the closing of Detroit's Hitsville USA studios in 1972, Motown had primarily moved its location to Los Angeles, where Gaye also relocated while he recorded the Trouble Man album. Gaye invited several musicians, including some from the Funk Brothers and musicians from Hamilton Bohannon's band. Gaye would compose five different versions of the title track, including an alternate vocal version, which was used primarily for the film's intro. The alternate version featured Gaye double-tracking two lead vocal parts into one, bringing his falsetto vocals with his tenor on top of the falsetto. The single version, which was also featured on the soundtrack, would feature a single lead vocal take. The other three versions were put on the album as instrumentals with Gaye providing synthesizer keyboards while saxophone solos (and occasionally guitar) accompany him. The only other songs in which Gaye vocalized harmonies or performed lead vocals included \\"Poor Abbey Walsh\\", \\"Cleo's Apartment\\", \\"Life is a Gamble\\", \\"Don't Mess with Mister T\\" and \\"There Goes Mister T\\". Critical reception Bolstered by the hit success of the title track, which returned Gaye to a blues format reaching #4 on the Soul Chart and #7 on the Pop Charts, respectively, the album followed in December where it reached the top 20 of the Billboard 200, peaking at #12. On Cashbox and Record World Magazines Charts the album even reached the Top 5, respectively, hitting almost as high as its monumental predecessor What‘s Going On, eighteen months earlier. It would become Gaye's only soundtrack and film score. Critics gave the album favorable reviews while sometimes comparing Gaye's soundtrack efforts to that of Hayes' and Mayfield's. Following this, other R&B; musicians would produce soundtracks of their own, including James Brown, Barry White and fellow Motown acts, Willie Hutch and Edwin Starr. The album was referenced positively in the 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, with Falcon (Anthony Mackie) saying to Captain America (Chris Evans): \\"everything you missed jammed into one album.\\" There is also a clip of the titular track playing on an iPhone in one hospital scene.

Sometimes this is desirable either to improve the handling properties of an explosive (e.g. when munitions are filled in factories) or to reduce its sensitivity, brisance or detonation velocity. TNT explosive can itself be used to phlegmatize more sensitive explosives such as RDX (to form Cyclotol), HMX (to form Octol) or PETN (to form Pentolite). Other typical phlegmatizing agents include paraffin wax (5% used in OKFOL and Composition H6), paper or even water (used in water gel explosives). Such agents are nearly always flammable themselves (therefore adding fuel to the blast) or will at least boil off easily. Typically, a small amount of phlegmatizing agent is used e.g. Composition B, which has 1% paraffin wax added, or the Russian RGO hand grenade which contains 90 grams of \\"A-IX-1\\" explosive, comprising 96% RDX and 4% paraffin wax by weight. Another example of use is the VS-50 antipersonnel mine, which contains an explosive filling of 43 grams of RDX, again phlegmatized by combining it with 10% paraffin wax by weight. Explosive compounds may exist in material states that limit their application. For instance, nitroglycerin is normally an oily liquid. Phlegmatization of nitroglycerin allows it to be formed as a solid, commonly known as dynamite. It also allows the liquid, which is very sensitive to shock, to be handled more vigorously.

Durand had an attacking style, winning the Tour of Flanders in 1992 after a breakaway, and three stages in the Tour de France. Durand turned professional in 1990. He was national road champion in 1993 and 1994 and won Paris–Tours in 1998, the first French winner in 42 years. Durand rode seven Tours de France, finishing last in the 1999 race. In 1995 he was the surprise winner of the prologue, starting before it began raining. He wore the yellow jersey for two days. Durand won the combativity award in the 1998 and 1999 Tour de France; the latter year he also took the Lanterne Rouge. He retired at the end of 2004. He has since worked for Eurosport as a commentator. Amateur career Durand was born to a poor farming family in the Mayenne region of northern France.L'Équipe, 14 July 2000 He started racing in the minime class, the very youngest, but never won a race there or in the older cadet category. \\"It's difficult to win as a kid when you're neither a climber nor a sprinter,\\" he said. \\"For me, the most beautiful jersey in the world is the French champion's. Yes, when they play the Marseillaise for you after a championship and then you go and show it off for three weeks in the Tour de France, the national flag on your shoulders, it's emotion and pleasure every day.\\"L'Équipe, 14 July 2000 As a senior, however, he won the national amateur team time-trial championship in 1988 with Laurent Bezault, Pascal Lino and Thierry Laurent. He turned professional in 1991. Lone breaks Durand became celebrated for long, lone attacks which sometimes succeeded but usually didn't. The French magazine, Vélo, printed a monthly Jackymètre to log the kilometres ridden at the head of races during the course of the season. Durand said: \\"Fortunately, in cycling, it's not always the best who wins, otherwise we wouldn't win so often.\\"Vélomania, France, February 2005 His riding style was encouraged by his first directeur sportif, Cyrille Guimard. It brought him a seemingly suicidal win in the Tour of Flanders (see below). Guimard told him to attack early in the national championship at Châtellerault in 1993, to try his chance and to spoil those of Laurent Brochard and Luc Leblanc.Vélomania, France, February 2005 The writer, Jean-François Quénet, said Guimard told Durand to attack far from the finish \\"because he didn't want to see Laurent Brochard in blue, white and red and even less did he want a second consecutive title for Luc Leblanc, who was in disgrace in the Castorama team.\\".Vélomania, France, February 2005 Of the way he rode, Durand said: :I'm not a revolutionary of any sort, but on the bike, I've always refused to come out of a mould. It astonishes me that most riders are followers, even sheep. A lot of them, the only people who know they're in the Tour are their directeurs sportifs. I couldn't do the job like that. They finish the Tour without having attacked once, maybe the whole of the season, even the whole of their career. I'd rather finish shattered and last having attacked a hundred times than finish 25th without having tried. Yes, I get ragged about it, but it's always in a friendly way. In the bunch, the guys know that Dudu is as likely to finish a long way behind them as first.L'Équipe, 14 July 2000 Tour of Flanders Durand won the Ronde van Vlaanderen, or Tour of Flanders, in 1992, 36 years after the last French winner, Jean Forestier, in 1956. He broke away from the field with Thomas Wegmüller after a quarter of the race, with 217 km still to ride.Vélomania, France, February 2005 His success as an outsider, and after such a long lone ride, stayed in the memory of Belgian fans. Years later, Durand was stopped for speeding. The Belgian policeman who came to his car said, \\"Vous avez gagné le Tour des Flandres en nonante-deux\\" (\\"You won the Tour of Flanders in '92\\") - and let him drive on. Durand finished his career with Belgian teams. \\"Winning the Ronde made me a bit of a naturalised Belgian,\\" he said.L'Équipe, 14 July 2000 Doping and disqualification Durand took drugs during the Tour de la Côte Picarde in 1996 and was given a one-month probationary suspension.L'Équipe, 9 January 1997 He was disqualified during the Tour de France in 2002 for holding on to a car during the mountainous stage to the Plateau de Beille in the Pyrenees.

Early life Aleks Çaçi came from a poor family and as result he started to work at a very early stage of his life. While working the land he also found himself employed in the printing offices of the time. Aleks Çaçi finished the Trade School of Vlora and the Institute of High Trade (business would be the equivalent of today) in Greece. After the liberation of Albania from fascism he completed the school of the regime \\"Vladimir Ilic Lenin\\". He was among the early and young authors of the realist literature, or socialist realist as it was later dubbed of the 30s, as well as a member of the Communist Group of Korça. Literary career Aleks Çaçi(left) and Ilya Ehrenburg in Sofia, Bulgaria 1945 As a result of his revolutionary activities as well as his writings, in 1936 he was isolated in the city of Berat for two years by King Zogu's regime. Çaçi was an active member of the war for independence from foreign oppression. Since the early days of the organization he worked in the editing group of \\"Kushtrimi i Lirise\\"(Battle cry of Freedom) where he published many articles, poems and prizes. Aleks Çaçi was also in charge of another newspaper, \\"Trumpeta Clirimtare\\" (The Freedom Trumpet) that used to be published in wartime in the Kurvelesh region in south Albania.Kostallari, Androkli - Aleks Çaçi, Vepra Letrare, Vol 1, Shtëpia Botuese Naim Frashëri, Viti 1987 After the war he worked in many newspapers and literary magazines. He spent many years in China as writer and publicist during the time when Albania had close relationships with Maoist China. For work and creative merits Çaçi was awarded by the Congress of that time with the order of \\"Flamuri i Kuq i Punes\\"(Red flag of Work) of the First Degree. He published many books and worked in \\"Lidhia e Shkrimtareve\\" (The league of writers) until his death in 1989. Towards the 1980s he retired in a smart fashion from the political life in Albania which was eating countless intellectual heads for the pleasures of Enver Hoxha. This was a time of instability with the political assassinations and/or suicides and mass arrests of intellectual figures that plagued the country in the 1980s. During the last 15 years of his life he detached himself from the political arena as the corruption became rampant and the ideals of communism crumbled under the weight of ruthless dictatorship. With his friends he translated many books from Ancient Greek, Modern Greek and Italian into Albanian. He is widely known in Greece and Italy and his figure is an example of an Albanian intellectual and patriot that is revered in all that area which few people have managed to do. A Collected Works series was published by the Naim Frashëri publishing house two years before his death, featuring three volumes containing poems, prose and short plays of his diverse literary career.

A surcingle is a strap made of leather or leather-like synthetic materials such as nylon or neoprene, sometimes with elastic, that fastens around the horse's girth. A surcingle may be used for ground training, some types of in-hand exhibition, and over a saddle or horse pack to stabilize the rider's weight. It also is a primary component of a horse harness. A basic surcingle is unpadded, attaches around the horse by means of buckles or rings, and has no other hardware. A training surcingle, sometimes called a \\"roller,\\" has many extra rings attached, running from the ribcage up to the withers area. It usually has padding to relieve pressure on the horse's spine. A variation of this design is used for equestrian vaulting. Uses A simple surcingle over a horse racing saddle Detail of a training surcingle or \\"roller\\" Many trainers first teach a young horse to accept girth pressure by strapping on a surcingle before a saddle and girth. The surcingle is commonly used for longeing, often as a base from which to attach training equipment such as side reins, overcheck, lauffer reins (sliding side reins), or chambons. A surcingle is also important in long lining or ground driving, as it provides rings for the long reins to run through. Double longeing, using two longe lines, requires the use of a surcingle to thread the longe lines through the rings.Price The Whole Horse Catalog 2nd ed. p. 194-195 Compared to a saddle, a surcingle allows more precise adjustment of side reins due to the placement of additional rings. While a saddle only provides one height to attach the rings (the girth buckles), and can be uneven or at the wrong position, a training surcingle places rings at more appropriate locations for ground work. Many surcingle designs allow the side reins to be attached at several different heights along the sides of the horse. Placement A surcingle (or roller) used for equestrian vaulting. When used without a saddle, a surcingle sits just behind the withers. When used with a saddle, the surcingle runs over the seat near the pommel. A surcingle is also used over the top of certain types of pack saddle and pack to keep the pack bags and swag in place. A surcingle is usually used with a pad, and fit to the horse's back as carefully as a saddle would be. It is tightened enough to prevent slipping, more when used with a saddle and rider, less when used for ground training.
