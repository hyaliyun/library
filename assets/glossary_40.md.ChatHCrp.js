Although she had many supporters for the feedings, she was also criticized for drawing a large population of eagles to the area. After her death, the city of Homer passed a law prohibiting the feeding of predatory birds. Early life Jean Marie Hodgdon was born on October 20, 1923 in Aitkin County, Minnesota. The eldest of three sisters and one brother, she grew up on a dairy farm in Aitkin, where she helped with farm chores including herding, feeding, and milking cows. She learned to ride horses and became a talented horse breaker and trainer.Anderson, Cary. (2005). The Eagle Lady: Jean Keene. Anchorage, AK: Eagle Eye Pictures. . In 1952, she was recruited by the traveling rodeo outfit Red River Rodeo as a trick rider, and by the mid-1950s was anticipating an upcoming appearance with Red River at Madison Square Garden. However, her rodeo career was abruptly cut short in a riding accident during a performance at Olympia Arena in Detroit, Michigan. While performing a trick called the \\"death drag\\", she missed a handhold after leaning back too far in her saddle. She fell from her horse and was knocked unconscious when her head hit the arena wall. Her foot was still caught in the stirrup, and she was dragged around the arena, tangled in the horse's legs, until other rodeo personnel were able to stop the horse. She suffered 15 fractures in her left knee. After surgery to repair her knee, she spent several months in recovery encased from the waist down in a plaster cast. After the cast was removed, she was still able to walk and ride, but not with the facility needed to perform in the rodeo. For a time she worked as a professional truck driver hauling cattle. In the late 1950s she married, and gave birth to a son, Lonnie, before divorcing. By the early 1960s she was a single mother. She opened up a dog and cat grooming business and also raised and bred cocker spaniels. She later became the owner and operator of Jolly Chef Truck Stop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Keene came to Alaska for the first time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she returned for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there ‚Äî alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed old enough to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.McKinney, Debbie. (1986-06-02). \\"Homer's Eagle Lady.\\" Anchorage Daily News, p. C1. Retrieved through Newsbank.com (subscription required) on 2007-04-08. Feeding the eagles Eagles near Keene's home. Keene's career as the \\"Eagle Lady\\" began shortly after her arrival in Homer, when one morning she noticed two bald eagles on the beach near her motorhome. Keene saw offering food to the eagles as a natural extension of her practice of keeping bird feeders filled with sunflower seeds for wild songbirds. She began to bring home surplus fish in a bucket from her job, and each morning would throw some fish to the eagles over the short driftwood fence she had made around her motorhome. By the end of that spring, a half-dozen eagles were showing up for breakfast. The eagles departed with the arrival of summer, when the Spit became more active with human visitors, but they returned in the winter when tourist season had ended, and Keene resumed the daily feeding. Within ten years, over 200 bald eagles were visiting during winter and early spring each day, and the job of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to stockpile fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she loaded up in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her motorhome, about from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have to lug the large garbage cans into her motorhome to thaw. \\"I don't know if anyone else would do this,\\" she told a reporter in 1986. \\"My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses.\\" Keene had been persistent in her efforts. In 1985 she broke her leg, but managed to keep to the feeding schedule even on crutches. In the winter of 1994 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and on her doctor's advice underwent a mastectomy. She hired a friend to conduct feeding operations in her absence, but was back to do it herself three days after surgery. On July 1, 1998, an ammonia leak and explosion at the Seward Fisheries plant caused a fire that led to the evacuation of Homer Spit and the ultimate destruction of the facility,Don Hunter, Don, Jon Little and Natalie Phillips.

Although the number of visiting eagles fluctuated, about 200 to 300 eagles would show up each day during the months of winter and early spring. Crows and gulls were also attracted to the area. Keene fed them an estimated 500 pounds (227 kg) of fish per day, about 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) per year. Her fish supply included surplus and freezer-burned fish from fish processing facilities still on the Spit, her own purchases using her limited funds from Social Security or retirement benefits, or fish contributed by her supporters.American Bald Eagle Information.

Many of Keene's strongest supporters were local hotel owners who got extra business in the normally sluggish winter season, and photographers who were able to use clever framing of shots in order to make it appear they were photographing eagles in the wild. These photographers made enough money from these works that they bought Keene a new house with some of the profits.

In a few cases, the birds have been shot at.ABC News: Bald Eagles: Menace to Alaska Town An ordinance passed by the Homer City Council in 2006 prohibits the feeding of eagles within the city limits; however, the city council granted Keene an exemption, giving her special permission to continue feeding bald eagles within city limits until April 2010,Stuart, Ben.

Death Keene died at home on January 13, 2009, aged 85, from a respiratory condition. After her death, the Homer city council passed a new resolution banning the feeding of eagles, crows, ravens and other predatory and scavenger birds by any person, effective March 19, 2009. The resolution's effective date was delayed until spring out of concern that the birds would either die of starvation or become highly aggressive if the feeding ended in the middle of winter.

The primary character is a boy befriended by a cloud who is whisked away to Sector 7, the depot for clouds. There the boy produces blueprints of fantastic new designs, in the form of ocean creatures, for the disgruntled group of young clouds. As the young clouds experiment, they delight in their new forms. The adult clouds running the cloud depot are furious when they discover the young clouds' misbehavior, and they escort the boy back to the observatory. However, once the blueprints are examined further by the adults, they begin to admire the possibilities contained within them. As the children return home on the school bus, the New York skyline becomes filled with a profusion of clouds in the shapes of aquarium fish and ocean creatures.

History Iberian tomb near Azaila The village of Azaila lies on the right bank of the River Aguasvivas, in the Bajo Mart√≠n region. The name (shown as Zaylla in medieval texts) derives from Arabic and means \\"the flat\\". The first settlements were in the village of Cabezo de Alcal√°, by the River Aguasvivas, towards Vinaceite, where many different archaeological excavations have provided the stratigraphy of three successive occupations in the village. The first settlers came from central Europe (between the 7th century BC and 218 BC), followed by the Iberians and then the Romans, in the period running from 218 BC to 72 BC, before its final occupation, over the previous remains. It was destroyed between 76 and 72 BC during the Sertorian battles, although other studies have suggested a later date (49 BC), after the battle of Ilerda. Recently, a medieval Christian necropolis was discovered in the outskirts of the community, near to the ruins of a small medieval fort. It has been dated to some time between the 8th and 16th centuries. Apart from its name, which is a reference to the plain that extends to the south-east, very little is known about the Muslim settlement. After the Aragonese occupation at the end of the 12th century, the land was bestowed to aristocrats. In 1196, King Pedro II gave Azaila to Gast√≥n de Castellote, who, together with his family, continued to own the land in 1283. The names of Romana and Azaila were established in 1215 and 1285 from two of the many terms used during the 8th century. At the end of the 14th century, Azaila was owned by Gast√≥n de Rueda and in the beginning of the 17th century, in 1610, by Pedro de Lanuza. From a political and administrative point of view, Azaila was included in the Sobrecullida of Zaragoza (1488-1495), Vereda of Zaragoza (1646) and Corregimiento of Alca√±iz (1711-1833), mentioned as a village in 1495 and 1785, with its own council, probably from 1834. It was run by the district of H√≠jar, later to be incorporated in 1965 to the district of Alca√±iz. In the new regional organisation, established by the Diputaci√≥n General de Arag√≥n (the Aragonese government), it is included in the Bajo Mart√≠n region. Its parish is dedicated to Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario (Our Lady of the Rosary), although according to studies published by Pascual Madoz in the mid-19th century and professor Antonio, it was originally dedicated to Saint Peter the Martyr. The architecture dates from the 17th century, baroque style, which was commissioned by the Dukes of H√≠jar, whose shield can be seen above the church door. The work is basically masonry and brick, incorporating a closed nave with a semi-annular vault with lunettes, and at the head of the church is a tower with five bodies. After the summer of 1936 all of the interior decoration disappeared, although it has recently been recovered. With respect to the population, 20 homes were registered in 1489, which had reduced to 12 by 1495. All of them were Muslim. After the ejection of the Moors, the community was left almost empty, with 86 homes abandoned. 430 people, as recorded in transition 11, joined together at Azaila with people from neighbouring communities of Cuarte and Rod√©n, before continuing to Samper de Calanda, a distance of three leagues, and then passing through Caspe and Maella, the last settlement in Aragon. From there they travelled to the port of Los Alfaques, to the south of Tortosa, from which they sailed to the north of Africa. From the record of the homes in 1645 until 1718 the population remained constant with 8 homes, with 72 people in 1776. During the mid-19th century, according to Pascual Madoz, Azaila had 100 houses, 116 neighbours and 467 souls, with a stable population of around 400 neighbours. From 1970 to the last third of the 20th century, there were 363 inhabitants, at which point a steady drop of the population commenced, to the beginning of the 21st century when the population was around 200 people. Nowadays, the economic activity centres on agriculture.

Born in Kingston upon Thames to Frederick Atkinson Saunders and his wife, Mary Ann Roberta Walton, Hugh Cecil Saunders attended Tonbridge School and Queens' College Cambridge where he developed an interest in photography. At the Cambridge Photographic Society, he exhibited a number of landscapes, some of which won medals. Upon graduation, Saunders served as an apprentice with the prominent Sevenoaks photographer H. Essenhigh Corke. In 1912 he moved to London and, dropping his surname, set up as a professional portrait photographer at 100 Victoria Street. He married Kathleen Fairchild Huxtable in December 1989 in her hometown of Tunbridge Wells.http://donaldfamily.co.uk/62/29703.htm Hugh Cecil's photographs appeared regularly in the weekly The Sketch , Tatler and [Bystander] magazines, and his reputation as a fashionable photographer quickly grew. His early style was characterised by an elegant simplicity. Cecil moved to 8 Grafton Street in 1923--designing and furnishing an elaborately decorated studio, he often used patterned backdrops and lit the subject using soft reflected light. Cecil Beaton claims he was influenced by the style of Baron De Meyer. His portraits at the time included Gertrude Lawrence and, in 1925, the then-Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) sat for the first of many royal sittings. He would later take the official photographs for postage stamps for Edward V111. In 1926 Cecil published his Book of Beauty, consisting of 37 photogravures accompanied by selected verses. Some of these unnamed subjects include studies of actress Juliette Compton, Justine Johnstone, Edna Best, Lady Diana Cooper and Viscountess Curzon. Established as a success, he exhibited regularly at the London Salon of Photography and works appear in the annual Photograms of the Year between 1914-1928. Cecil had at least two pupil/assistants who established successful careers on their own Paul Tanqueray who had also attended Tonbridge School and Angus McBean whose work Cecil noticed when exhibited near his Gallery at a tea-room named, The Pirate's Den. McBean later claimed that he took many of his sittings in the mid 1930s. Although the studio continued as a functioning entity until the Second World War, including official photographs of King George VI. He later experimented with the photographic machine that became the basis of the Photo-Me studios that can be used to obtain instant identity photographs for passports and other official documents. He was to die in obscurity in Brighton and a number of his negatives were acquired by the National Portrait Gallery after a house clearance. He died in Brighton in 1974.

The company specialised in design and construction of primary trainers/tourers and advanced trainers. One of their products - the Stampe-Vertongen SV.4 - has become known in certain countries as just Stampe. History Established in 1922 with Alfred Renard as its chief designer, the company designed a series of trainer/tourer aircraft in the 1920s and 1930s, all prefixed RSV (for Renard, Stampe & Vertongen). In the early 1930s Alfred Renard left to join a company he had formed with his brother Georges Renard Soci√©t√© Anonyme d'Avions et de Moteurs Renard. The RSV company designation prefix then changed to SV. The company's most successful design was the SV.4 of 1933, a light tourer/trainer biplane powered by a de Havilland Gipsy III engine. Although only 35 were produced before the start of the war, a total of 940 were built, mainly under licence by other companies. The company was renamed Stampe et Renard when Stampe- Vertongen merged with the Renard company. Owing to the German invasion production ceased on 10 May 1940. Post-war activities did not meet with much success, and the company closed down in 1957.

Career details Portrait of Satie, the bohemian, near the Moulin de la Galette' by Ramon Casas, (1891) Glazer was born in Chester, Wisconsin on February 19, 1915, the sixth child of Benjamin and Clara Glazer, Jewish emigrants from Lithuania. The family moved to Milwaukee in 1919. His first piano lessons were given by his sister Blanche (1907‚Äì1920); later he was taught by several local musicians. Frank Glazer was educated in Milwaukee Public Schools, and graduated the city's North Division High School in 1932. In his teenage years, he played in his brothers' dance band, his high school band and vaudeville. Alfred Strelsin, a New York City signage manufacturer and arts patron, provided the funds for Glazer to travel to Berlin in 1932 to study with Artur Schnabel; he also studied with Arnold Schoenberg. Glazer then taught piano in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Strelsin urged Glazer to make his New York debut, telling him, \\"If you don't start by the time you're 21, forget it\\". Glazer made his debut at Town Hall in New York City on October 20, 1936, with a program of Bach, Brahms, Schubert and Chopin. He played this program again in 2006, to celebrate his seventieth anniversary of public performance. In 1939 Glazer performed with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Sergei Koussevitzky. Glazer served in the United States Army as an interpreter from 1943 to 1945 in Germany and France. In the early 1950s, Glazer had his own television show called Playhouse 15 in Milwaukee. On September 6, 1952, he married classical singer Ruth Gevalt (1910‚Äì2006). (1) With his wife, Ruth, he founded in the 1970s the Saco River Festival in Maine, a summer chamber series. From 1965 until 1980 Glazer taught at the Eastman School of Music; among his students Myriam Avalos and Martin Amlin. In 1980 Glazer left Eastman and became artist in residence at Bates College in Maine. Glazer has been called \\"the greatest interpreter of the piano music of Erik Satie\\".Edward Greenfield in \\"The Second Penguin Guide to Bargain Records\\" - E. Greenfield and Ivan March -1970 In the 1960s he recorded the complete piano music of Satie for the Vox label.

He was born in 1899 on a family farm outside Longwood village in County Meath. During the Irish War of Independence he was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), and was captain of the local Longwood Company. In 1920 he and some of his brothers took part in a raid on the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) Barracks in Trim, which was burnt to the ground. The aim of the raid was to supply arms to local volunteers. After the raid the arms were dispersed to different sites, one of which was the Giles family farm. During a raid by the Crown forces, his name was found on a note linking him to the storing of these arms and he was sent to prison in Perth, Scotland for three years, but he got out after one year shortly before the Anglo-Irish Truce. In the split that followed after the Anglo-Irish Treaty, he, like most of the IRA in County Meath took the Pro-treaty side. Later he served in the National Army and achieved the rank of Captain. In 1934 he was elected to Meath County Council. In 1935, Giles was elected to the Executive Committee of the League of Youth, one of the many names of Eoin O'Duffy's fascistic Blueshirts.White, M.

Page 54, Ph.D. Queen Mary - University Of London, available at https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/30695821.pdf At the 1937 general election he was elected as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Fine Gael representing the Meath‚ÄìWestmeath. By this time he had acquired a farm in Drumlargan near Summerhill, County Meath. He held his seat in subsequent elections until the constituency was abolished prior to the 1948 general election. At the 1948 general election he was elected for the re-established Meath constituency. He held his seat up to the 1961 general election in which he was unable to run due to deteriorating health. He died in 1965. Anti-Semitic Quotes \\"Who owns the wealth of Dublin? Is it the Irish volunteers or the Irish people?

Grimes joined the team during the 1966 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1981 championship. During that time he won one All- Ireland medal, four Munster medals (two as a substitute), one National Hurling League medal and two All-Star awards. An All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions, Grimes captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 1973. At club level Grimes was a four-time county club championship medalist with South Liberties. Playing career =Colleges= During his secondary schooling at CBS Sexton Street, Grimes became a member of the college senior hurling team. In 1964 he won his first Harty Cup medal following a defeat of St. Flannan's College. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw the Limerick side face St. Peter's College, Wexford. A 6‚Äì7 to 4‚Äì5 victory gave Grimes an All-Ireland medal. Grimes added a second Harty Cup medal the following year, before losing to St. Kieran's College in the All-Ireland decider on a score line of 6‚Äì9 to 6‚Äì1. In his final year with the school, Grimes won a third successive Harty Cup medal as captain of the side, following a defeat of Thurles CBS. The subsequent All-Ireland decider against St. Mary's of Galway was a rout, with a large 8‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì2 victory giving Grimes a second All-Ireland medal. =Club= Grimes played his club hurling, along with his brothers Lar, John, Mikey and Joe, with the South Liberties GAA Club in Limerick. After playing in two losing county finals, Grimes was at midfield again when South Liberties faced Patrickswell in 1972. A 4‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì5 victory gave Grimes a Limerick Senior Hurling Championship medal. Four years later Grimes added a second championship medal to his collection following a 2‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Killeedy. South Liberties surrendered their title the following year, but they reached the final again in 1978. Grimes won a third championship medal following a 2‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì5 defeat of Bruree. In 1981 South Liberties defeated Kilmallock by 4‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì11, giving Grimes a fourth championship medal. Grimes retired from club hurling in 1986. =Minor and under-21= Grimes first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick minor hurling team in 1963. He was an unused substitute that year when Limerick defeated Tipperary by 4‚Äì12 to 5‚Äì4 to take the Munster Minor Hurling Championship crown. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Limerick face Wexford. Grimes was introduced as a substitute, but Wexford won a high-scoring game by 6‚Äì12 to 5‚Äì9. Two years later Grimes was in his final year in the grade and was a regular member of the starting fifteen. A 5‚Äì5 to 3‚Äì9 defeat of Tipperary gave him his first Munster medal on the field of play. Limerick were defeated by 4‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì7 by Dublin in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. Grimes subsequently joined the Limerick under-21 hurling team; however, he had little success in this grade. =Senior= Grimes subsequently joined the Limerick senior team, making his debut the day before he was due to sit his Leaving Certificate in a Munster quarter-final defeat of Tipperary. In 1971 Limerick hurling bounced back after over a decade in the doldrums. A narrow 3‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì11 defeat of Tipperary gave Grimes a National Hurling League medal. Two years later Grimes was appointed captain of the team as Limerick finally made the provincial breakthrough. A last-minute free by Richie Bennis secured a 6‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì18 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial decider and a first Munster medal for Grimes. It was Limerick's first provincial championship since 1955. Grimes later led his team to Croke Park for an All-Ireland showdown with reigning champions and injury-ravaged Kilkenny. A Mossie Dowling goal eight minutes after half-time, together with a series of scores by Richie Bennis led Limerick to a 1‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì14 victory. This gave Grimes an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medal, and he had the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup on behalf of the team. Following the conclusion of the championship he was presented with his first All-Star award, as well as being named Texaco Hurler of the Year. In 1974 Limerick maintained their provincial dominance. Grimes captured a second Munster medal following a 6‚Äì14 to 3‚Äì9 win over Clare. This victory allowed Grimes's side advance directly to the All- Ireland final where Kilkenny provided the opposition once again. While Kilkenny were back to full strength, Limerick went into an early lead. However, this was diminished as Pat Delaney, Eddie Keher and Mick Brennan scored goals. Limerick lost the game by 3‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì13. Limerick failed to win a third provincial championship, but Grimes won a second All-Star award in 1975. By 1980 Grimes had been dropped from the starting fifteen. He was a non- playing substitute as Limerick won the Munster final by 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì10 that year and denied Cork a record-breaking sixth successive title. The subsequent All- Ireland decider pitted Limerick against Galway; however, Grimes started the game outside of the starting fifteen once again. He was introduced to the field of play during the game. Though √âamonn Cregan scored 2‚Äì7 for Limerick, Galway went on to win the game by 2‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì9. Limerick retained their provincial crown in 1981 following a 3‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì9 defeat of Clare, but Grimes was still a non-playing substitute. His career drew to an end when eventual champions Offaly defeated Limerick in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. =Inter-provincial= Grimes was also selected for Munster in the inter- provincial series of games. He made his debut with the province in 1972 and was a regular at various intervals until his retirement in 1978. During that time he won two Railway Cup medals as a non-playing substitute in 1976 and 1978. Personal life Grimes lives in Limerick, with his wife, Helen. They married in the 1970s and have two children. After completing his education Grimes later worked as a sales representative for Beamish and Crawford. His name re-appeared in sports reports many years later when his friend and fellow member and benefactor of the South Liberties club, J.P. McManus, named his successful racehorse \\"Grimes\\" in his honour.

Henry is the president and CEO of the Gallant Group, an insurance agency specializing in healthcare consulting. Early life Tom Henry was the second of 17 children born to Jerome and Marganelle \\"Marge\\" Henry. He attended Fort Wayne Central Catholic High School, graduating in 1970. He served in the United States Army Military Police Corps from 1971 to 1973. He then received a bachelor's degree in psychology and an MBA, both from the University of Saint Francis. City Council Henry represented the Third District for five terms on the Fort Wayne City Council between 1984 and 2004. He was preceded by the Republican Roy Schomburg. Henry won re-election in 1995 by only five votes after the outcome was determined by a recount. He lost a bid for a sixth term in 2003. Mayoral campaigns Henry announced his bid for the Democratic nomination for mayor on February 21, 2007. He had considered running for mayor in 1999, but backed out and supported the Democratic challenger who went on to become mayor, Graham Richard. Henry won the Democratic mayoral primary on May 8, 2007, with 82.4 percent of the vote against token opposition. He defeated the Republican Matt Kelty in the November election, with 60 percent of the vote.'Underdog' Kelty tops Peters, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, May 9, 2007.

Henry won his fourth term as Mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana and said his fourth term would be his last. Mayoralty On December 15, 2008, Henry signed the revised noise ordinance passed by city council, making light pollution a violation of city ordinance. \\"Although I have concerns about this ordinance, it is up to council to decide what legislative action is appropriate for our community,\\" Henry said in a written statement. On December 9, Fort Wayne City Council voted 5‚Äì4 to pass a revised noise ordinance to include a section pertaining to improper use of directional lighting. Floodlights, bullet lights and spotlights must be focused away from a neighbor's home, or Fort Wayne Police can cite the offender if a complaint is made. Security lights are permissible. The amendment was introduced at the August 12 meeting by John Shoaff, D-at large, to end a dispute between two of his constituents, one of whom had allegedly been shining a directional light into the other's home. Henry said council should still work to hone the amendment so it can be enforced when necessary. \\" ‚Ä¶This ordinance will be difficult to enforce as written and ‚Ä¶ certain exceptions to its provisions should be considered,\\" Henry said in a statement. \\"Amongst the concerns raised were athletic events held in the evening, holiday light displays and emergency repair work, to name a few.\\" Personal life Henry married Cindy n√©e Kocks in 1975. They have two children and, as of 2009, two grandchildren. Henry and his family are Catholics and members of the Most Precious Blood Catholic Church.

Online version retrieved Jan. 12, 2008. In his 1949 review, Bosley Crowther characterized the film succinctly: The still photographer Helen Levitt was one of the film's cinematographers and writers, along with the painter Janice Loeb. The neoclassical composer Ulysses Kay wrote the score for the film. The film's principal cinematographer, Richard Bagley, also photographed the critically acclaimed New York semidocumentary feature On the Bowery. The film's three writers - Meyers, Loeb, and Levitt - were nominated for the Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Academy Award during the 22nd Academy Awards. The award, however, went to Robert Pirosh for Battleground. The film itself was also nominated for the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award the year before during the 21st Academy Awards for 1948. Likewise, it did not win this award as it went to The Secret Land (produced by Orville O. Dull). The National Board of Review named The Quiet One the second best film of 1949.

It was situated in the foothills of the Northern Rockies about northwest of Cadomin along the Bighorn Highway (Highway 40), at the end of the CN Railway line. History Luscar lies in an area known as the Alberta Coal Branch, which has a long history of coal mining. The original underground mine at Luscar opened in 1921, and by 1922 the town consisted of about 25 or 30 homes, a small cottage hospital, a school, a general store and other shops. The mine worked the strongly folded Jewel Seam and produced steam coal, primarily for railroad markets. Surface mining began in 1945 and underground mining had ceased by 1954. Fire destroyed the briquette plant in 1956 and later that year all mining ceased due to lack of markets for steam coal, after which the town was abandoned. In 1970 the old Luscar townsite became the headquarters for an open-pit coal mine owned jointly by Luscar Ltd. and Consolidation Coal Company and operated by Cardinal River Coals Ltd. It produced coking coal for export to Asian steel mills.Tribe, John 1980. Luscar's coal mining operations. Bulletin of Canadian Mining and Metallurgy, January 1980, p. 97-100. That mine closed at the end of 2000. Coal from the Cheviot Mine near Mountain Park is currently trucked to the Luscar site where it is cleaned and loaded into rail cars.

While afloat in the CENTCOM AOR, they serve as a visible deterrent force, train continuously, and participate in a wide range of engagement activities. In addition to providing MAGTFs deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships, MARCENT has the proven capability to deploy MAGTFs to the CENTCOM AOR by air and marry-up with prepositioned equipment. This provides COMUSCENTCOM with a rapid response capability across the range of military operations. Though there have been Marines stationed at CENTCOM Headquarters since September 1982, MARCENT, as a service component command, did not come into existence until 1990, when Marine Corps forces were preparing for Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM in Southwest Asia. Beginning in 2001, under the command of Commander, Marine Corps Forces Pacific, MARCENT participated in multiple operations, including Operation ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan and Pakistan, operations in the Central Asian States as well as the Horn of Africa, and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. On 3 August 2005, Headquarters Marine Corps designated MARCENT as a force headquarters, under the command of Commanding General, I Marine Expeditionary Force. U. S. Marine Corps Forces, Central Command, headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida received its dedicated three-star Commander on 7 September 2012.

The program was based on the US version, which aired on NBC in 1983 and was hosted by Peter Tomarken. Gameplay In the first round, three players watched a film clip and then answered a series of questions about it. Each correct answer earned a \\"hitman\\" for the player who gave it. The first two players to earn five hitmen advanced to the next round; the third was eliminated and given a consolation prize consisting of champagne and caviar. For the second round, each of the remaining two players was given an army of hitmen to defend. The first player who qualified for the round received nine hitmen, while the second player received eight. They watched a new film clip and answered questions about it, with each correct answer eliminating one of the opponent's hitmen. The contestant loses one hitman if they get their question wrong. The first player to wipe out all of his/her opponent's hitmen won the game and advanced to the final round for a chance to win up to ¬£3,000. In this round, the winner stood facing away from a board with eight columns, each of which contained a random number of hitmen from one to five, and had 60 seconds to clear up to three of them. He/she chose a column and tried to clear it out by answering questions on both of the film clips in the earlier rounds, earning ¬£1,000 per column cleared. A wrong answer meant that the player had to abandon the current column and choose a new one. Completing three columns awarded the top prize of ¬£3,000. At the time of the show's broadcast, ¬£3,000 was the maximum allowable cash prize on a game show in the United Kingdom. The first winner of this top prize, Paul Grimshaw from Wakefield, briefly held the UK record for the highest cash winnings on a game show. Transmissions  The series had 15 episodes and ran between 21 February to 30 May on Tuesdays at 19.00.

High school Pridemore played for the Ansted High School Highlanders and was a member of the record setting team that won 36 straight games on their way to winning back-to-back state championships (1971 and 1972). College Pridemore, who was inducted into the West Virginia University Hall of Fame in 2001, holds school records that include: most career interception return yards (398 - 26.5 yards per return), most single game interception return yards, and most career interceptions (15). He also holds a WVU school record which doubles as an NCAA record as the Longest interception returned for a touchdown (102 yards vs Penn State). As a sophomore, Pridemore led the Mountaineers to a 1975 Peach Bowl victory against the NC State Wolfpack. NFL After being drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in 1978, Pridemore saw his first start in the third game of his rookie year and never looked back. Pridemore was Atlanta's starting free safety for the next eight years, and earned the reputation as one of the meanest, hardest-hitting safeties in the game. With 21 career interceptions (returned for 368 total yards), Pridemore ranks sixth on Atlanta's all-time pick list behind Deion Sanders. He ranks fourth on the all-time list for most interceptions in a season at 7, and holds the Falcon's club record for most interception return yards in a single season (271). In 1981 Pridemore picked off a Joe Montana pass from a yard deep in Atlanta's own end-zone and returned it 101 yards for a touchdown, which is a team record. This duplication of Pridemore's previous college and NCAA record will probably also stand for quite some time, if not forever in Atlanta. While playing for the Falcons, Pridemore served one term in the West Virginia House of Delegates, between 1980 and 1982 as a Democrat. He is the only NFL player to hold this legislative office while playing professional football. Life after football After his tenure with the Falcons, Pridemore settled in Atlanta with his wife Leigh and four children, and went on to found Pride Utility Construction Company with long-time friend and teammate Scott Case. Pridemore is a prominent businessman in the greater Atlanta area, and has personal ventures in residential real-estate and timber properties. Pridemore had two sons who played football at the collegiate level. Matt, the eldest, enrolled at Duke University as a wide receiver in 2007, and TJ, who played fullback for the University of Florida, enrolled in 2008.

She lives in Antigua and Washington, D.C. with her husband, and their two children, Trey and Elyse. John made her literary debut with Unburnable. Unburnable which moves back and forth between modern times and the past, is primarily a historical novel centred on the hanging of a family matriarch, and fuses Caribbean history, African heritage, and African-American sensibilities. Marie-Elena John parlays her knowledge of the African diaspora, including the United States and the Caribbean island of Dominica, into a work that shifts from modern to colonial and pre-colonial times, exploring the intersection of history, African mythology and African-Caribbean culture. Important themes include the African origins of Carnival and masquerades, African religion, the practice of Obeah, syncretic Catholicism, Caribbean folklore, the Maroons and resistance to slavery. In this respect, Unburnable is both a contemporary Caribbean novel as well as a neo-slave narrative.

It is an example of the concept of harm reduction, a strategy for dealing with the abuse of other drugs. Tobacco smoking is widely acknowledged as a leading cause of illness and death, and reducing smoking is vital to public health. In high income countries, smoking rates have been reduced mostly by reducing the uptake of smoking among younger people rather than improving the rates of quitting among established smokers. It is, however, current smokers who will face disease and death from smoking. Nicotine itself, however, is addictive but not otherwise very harmful, as shown by the long history of people safely using nicotine replacement therapy products (e.g., nicotine gum, nicotine patch). Nicotine increases heart rate and blood pressure and has a range of local irritant effects but does not cause cancer. None of the three main causes of death from smoking‚Äîlung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease‚Äîis caused primarily by nicotine. The main reason smoking is deadly is the toxic mix of chemicals in smoke from combustion (burning) of tobacco. Products that can effectively and acceptably deliver nicotine without smoke have the potential to be less harmful than smoked tobacco. THR measures have been focused on reducing or eliminating the use of combustible tobacco by switching to other nicotine products, including: #Cutting down (either long-term or before quitting smoking) #Temporary abstinence #Switching to non-tobacco nicotine containing products, such as pharmaceutical nicotine replacement therapies or currently (generally) unlicensed products such as electronic cigarettes #Switching to smokeless tobacco products such as Swedish snus #Switching to non-combustible tobacco products Quitting all tobacco products definitively reduces risk the most. However, quitting is difficult, and even approved smoking cessation methods have a low success rate. In addition, some smokers may be unable or unwilling to achieve abstinence. Harm reduction is likely of substantial benefit to these smokers and public health. Providing reduced-harm alternatives to smokers is likely to result in lower total population risk than pursuing abstinence-only policies. The strategy is controversial: supporters of tobacco harm reduction assert that lessening the health risk for the individual user is worthwhile and manifests over the population in fewer tobacco-related illnesses and deaths. Opponents have argued that some aspects of harm reduction interfere with cessation and abstinence and might increase initiation. However, surveys carried from 2013 to 2015 in the UKAction on Smoking and Health, May 2016, Use of electronic cigarettes (vapourisers) among adults in Great Britain and France R√©sultats de l'enqu√™te cigarette √©lectronique ETINCEL - OFDT, 2014 suggest that on the contrary, the availability of safer alternatives to smoking is associated with decreased smoking prevalence and increased smoking cessation. History The concept of tobacco harm reduction dates back to at least 1976 when Professor Michael Russell wrote: \\"People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar\\" and suggested that the ratio of tar to nicotine could be the key to safer smoking. Since then, the harm from smoking has been well-established as being caused almost exclusively by toxins released through the combustion of tobacco. In contrast, non-combustible tobacco products as well as pure nicotine products are considerably less harmful, although they still have the potential for addiction. Debates on tobacco harm reduction tend to be geographically defined arguments, because of the varying legal, moral, and historical status of tobacco, and the different types of tobacco products and use in different cultures around the world. For instance, cigarette smoking is the dominant form in the United States, while use of cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco is limited to a much smaller population. Anti-smoking advocacy efforts and widespread popularization of the negative health effects of smoking over the last few decades have led to restrictions in the sale and use of tobacco products. Despite this, tobacco in all its forms has remained a legal product in most societies. A notable exception is the European Union, where the most dangerous products (cigarettes) are available but smokeless tobacco products, which are far less hazardous, are banned. The exception is Sweden, where there is a long tradition of smokeless tobacco (snus) use among men. In October 2008 the American Association of Public Health Physicians (AAPHP) became the first medical organization in the U.S. to officially endorse tobacco harm reduction as a viable strategy to reduce the death toll related to cigarette smoking.Update on the Scientific Status of Tobacco Harm Reduction, 2008-2010. Prepared for the American Association of Public Health Physicians. Brad Rodu, DDS and Joel L Nitzkin, MD. June 28, 2010.Principles to Guide AAPHP Tobacco Policy. American Association of Public Health Physicians. \\"Safer cigarettes\\" Cigarette manufacturers have attempted to design safer cigarettes for almost 50 years, but results have been marginal at best. Filters were introduced in the early 1950s, and manufacturers were selling low-yield cigarettes by the late 1960s. Initially it was thought that these innovations were harm reducing. For example, in 1976 investigators at the American Cancer Society published research concluding that light cigarettes were safer. The study authors wrote that \\"total death rates, death rates from coronary heart disease, and death rates from lung cancer were somewhat lower for those who smoked 'low' tar-nicotine cigarettes than for those who smoked 'high' tar-nicotine cigarettes.\\" However, scientific evidence suggests that switching from regular to light or low-tar cigarettes does not reduce the health risks of smoking or lower the smoker's exposure to the nicotine, tar, and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke. Indeed, the WHO recommends that misleading terms, including ‚Äòlight‚Äô and ‚Äòmild‚Äô, should be removed from tobacco product advertising, packaging, and labeling,. Smokeless tobacco  It has been established that use of Swedish and American smokeless tobacco confers only 0.1% to 10% of the risks of smoking, though smokeless products in India and elsewhere in Asia contain higher levels of contaminants and thus confer greater risks. Two respected medical groups believe that smokeless tobacco may play a role in reducing smoking-attributable deaths. In 2007, Britain's Royal College of Physicians concluded \\"...that smokers smoke predominantly for nicotine, that nicotine itself is not especially hazardous, and that if nicotine could be provided in a form that is acceptable and effective as a cigarette substitute, millions of lives could be saved.\\" In the United States, a study based on National Health Interview Survey data found that 73% of smokers who switched to smokeless tobacco as part of their latest quit attempt were successful in quitting smoking. In the same study, smokers who used pharmaceutical nicotine products in their most recent quit attempt had success rates between 0 and 35%. =Snus= Scandinavian snus is a moist form of smokeless tobacco which is usually placed under the upper lip, and is not smoked or swallowed. A 2014 report commissioned by Public Health England on another avenue for tobacco harm reduction, electronic cigarettes, said snus \\"has a risk profile that includes possible increases in risk of oesophageal and pancreatic cancer, and of fatal (but not non-fatal) myocardial infarction, but not COPD or lung cancer.\\" The report examined the case of snus as \\"a unique natural experiment in the impact of a socially accepted, non-medical, affordable and easily accessible reduced harm product on the prevalence of tobacco smoking\\". They concluded that \\"Although controversial, the Swedish natural experiment demonstrates that despite dual use and primary uptake of the reduced-harm product by young people, availability of reduced-harm alternatives for tobacco smokers can have a beneficial effect. While snus is not likely to become a legal or indeed politically viable option in the UK, this data proves the concept that harm reduction strategies can contribute to significant reductions in smoking prevalence.\\" Based on the mounting evidence that the health risks of Swedish snus are far lower than those of combustible tobacco products, in August 2014, Swedish Match (a manufacturer) filed a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) application with the FDA Center for Tobacco Products (CTP). The MRTP application seeks to modify the warning labels on smokeless tobacco products such that they reflect the evidence of reduced-harm compared to smoking. Among the proposed labeling changes, the MRTP application requests replacing the current warning, \\"This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes,\\" with this text: \\"No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes.\\" After five years, on October 22, 2019, the FDA granted the first- ever modified risk orders to Swedish Match USA, Inc. for eight snus smokeless tobacco products.https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/advertising-and- promotion/fda-authorizes-modified-risk-tobacco-products The FDA's review determined that the claim proposed by the company in its application is supported by scientific evidence, that consumers understand the claim and appropriately perceive the relative risk of these products compared to cigarettes, and that the modified risk products, as actually used by consumers, will significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users and benefit the health of the population as a whole.https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants- first-ever-modified-risk-orders-eight-smokeless-tobacco-products In particular, the FDA states, \\"the available scientific evidence, including long-term epidemiological studies, shows that relative to cigarette smoking, exclusive use of these specific smokeless tobacco products poses lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.\\" Electronic cigarettes E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that provide nicotine for inhalation in a vapour generated by heating a solution of water, nicotine propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin and typically some flavouring. They were first developed in China in 2003, and first introduced to Europe and the US around 2006. There are many brands and models of e-cigarettes available today but they can be broadly grouped into three categories. First generation e-cigarettes are similar in appearance to a conventional cigarette and are typically designed to be for single use. Second generation e-cigarettes are around the size of a large fountain pen, have a battery linked to a permanent vapouriser and a refillable tank for the nicotine solution. Third generation e-cigarettes tend to be larger, with a more powerful battery and two heating elements which allow users to carry the power. Nicotine delivery has typically increased with successive generations of e-cigarette, and it has been suggested that repeated use of second and third generation devices can result in sustained venous blood levels of nicotine which are comparable with those expected in smokers. Electronic cigarettes are a promising harm reduction technology because they deliver nicotine without the dangerous chemicals in tobacco smoke, while remaining attractive to smokers. While the eventual regulatory status of e-cigarettes in many countries remains uncertain, public health advocates view electronic cigarette as having a valid place within tobacco harm reduction strategy. In a first step towards the regulation of e-cigarettes, the MHRA granted Marketing Authorisations (licences) for the medicinal products e-Voke 10 mg and 15 mg Electronic Inhaler (PL 40317/0001-2) on 16 November 2015. Public health researchers in the UK estimated that 6,000 premature smoking-related deaths per year would be prevented for every million smokers who switched to e-cigarettes. Since currently approved smoking cessation methods have a 90% failure rate, the use of e-cigarettes as a prominent THR modality is likely to substantially reduce tobacco-related illness in the United States, with the potential to save 4.8 million lives over the next 20 years. A survey of UK adults found that over two thirds of ex-smokers and over one third of current smokers report that one of the main reasons they use e-cigarettes is to help them stop smoking completely. Research into the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, published up until January 2016, is limited, but suggests a potential increase in long term smoking cessation using e-cigarettes containing nicotine compared to those without, with no increased health risk compared to smokers with medium term use (two years or less). As with any new product, long term or rare adverse effects will not become clear until e-cigarettes have been in widespread use for decades. However, in an effort to decrease tobacco related death and disease, e-cigarettes appear to have a potential to be part of the strategy. Regulation of e-cigarettes varies around the world. The Institute for Global Tobacco Control (IGTC) has identified 68 countries that have laws regulating e-cigarettes, as at November 2016. Types of regulation include complete prohibition on the sale and marketing of e-cigarettes, prohibition on their use in enclosed public places, minimum age for purchase, an allowance for e-cigarettes to be sold under general consumer product regulations and most recently, in the UK, e-cigarettes may be brought to market as either medicines or consumer products (with those seeking medicines approval undergoing the standard medicines licensing process). The World Health Organization acknowledge that e-cigarettes may play a role in harm reduction strategies, but should be regulated to minimize any potential risks. However, the vast differences in regulatory approaches evident around the world highlights the challenge of developing a global regulatory approach. Heat-not-burn products A 2016 Cochrane review found that it was unclear whether using heat-not-burn tobacco products instead of traditional cigarettes would \\"substantially alter the risk of harm\\".  Public perceptions Smokers remain confused about tobacco harm reduction. In a 2004 survey, about 80-100% of participants incorrectly perceived low-yield cigarettes as harm-reducing, while 75-80% mistakenly believed that switching to smokeless tobacco conferred no risk reduction. Similar confusion exists about electronic cigarettes. In the UK, research commissioned by the anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health found that in 2016, more than three times as many people think e-cigarettes are as harmful or more harmful than smoking than in 2013 (25% vs 7%), the highest proportion since the survey began. They expressed concern that the proportion of adult smokers who thought that e-cigarettes were more or equally harmful than cigarettes was highest in those who had never tried e-cigarettes, and these perceived potential harms was the main reason why they had not tried them. In 2015 a report commissioned by Public Health England noted, as well as the UK figures above, that in the US belief among responders to a survey that vaping was safer than smoking cigarettes fell from 82% in 2010 to 51% in 2014. The report blamed \\"misinterpreted research findings\\", attracting negative media coverage, for the growth in the \\"inaccurate\\" belief that e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking, and concluded that \\"There is a need to publicise the current best estimate that using EC is around 95% safer than smoking\\"., pages 6, 11, 78-80 In an article published by the Wall Street Journal in 2016 entitled \\"Are E-Cigarettes a Healthy Way to Quit Smoking?\\", Dr. Jed E. Rose co-inventor of the nicotine patch said, \\"Having worked my entire career to develop effective smoking-cessation treatments, I have realized that current approaches are ineffective for the vast majority of smokers. Alternative approaches are urgently needed. The World Health Organization predicts a billion deaths will be attributable to smoking during the 21st century. Electronic cigarettes have an unparalleled potential to reduce the public-health impact of smoking, by allowing smokers to replace the habit and nicotine of smoking without the toxic effects of combustion.\\" Concerns around tobacco harm reduction strategies Whilst tobacco harm reduction approaches have the potential to reduce risks to the current adult smoking population, there are hypothesised potential hazards to wider public health. Smoking has become less acceptable over recent years in a number of countries, a result of a number of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) guidelines to reduce smoking prevalence. The renormalisation of smoking is a concern if e-cigarette use appears to become more appealing, for example through their use in locations where conventional cigarettes are prohibited, advertising and increased e-cigarette use by parents, siblings, peers, celebrities or other influential groups. Concerns have also been raised that non-tobacco nicotine use may results in uptake of tobacco smoking that would not otherwise have occurred. This ‚Äògateway theory‚Äô has been largely applied to the use of e-cigarettes by non-smokers and particularly children. There is no reported evidence, however, that NRT use among young people has ever acted as a gateway to smoking, or that e-cigarette use has resulted in any appreciable increase initiation of smoking among children or adults. The Royal College of Physicians suggest that any association between e-cigarette and conventional cigarette use is likely due to common liability to use these products and the use of e-cigarettes to reduce smoking. Dual use of tobacco products and non- tobacco nicotine by continuing smokers is another aspect which has raised concern. It is suggested that dual use could inadvertently sustain smoking by making it easier for smokers to temporarily abstain from tobacco use, or encourage smokers to move towards dual use rather than complete cessation in the mistaken belief that this offers significant health gains. Dual use of tobacco and NRT is licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) as a tobacco harm reduction strategy which actually increases the chance of quitting. The Royal College of Physicians reviewed evidence around dual use and smoking cessation and reported that findings were suggestive that e-cigarettes had the potential to offer the same cessation gains, although further research would be helpful to more clearly delineate such an effect.

Oliver and McMillan left the scene in Jones's car, while Jones forced the other man into a car and drove off in it. Jones stopped to put the man out, then sped off again, chased this time by the police. Jones then crashed into a telephone pole, ending the chase. Jones was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California for violating the federal carjacking statute, . The indictment did not name the particular subsection Jones was accused of violating. The magistrate judge informed Jones he faced a maximum sentence of 15 years, the smallest maximum sentence under the statute's three subsections. The trial judge instructed the jury under that subsection, which did not require proof of the fact or the extent of the victim's injuries. Jones was convicted of the carjacking count. A presentence investigation report recommended that Jones receive a 25-year sentence because one of the victims had suffered \\"serious bodily injury\\". Jones objected that this sentence was not authorized because the serious bodily injury component was not charged in the indictment. The district court overruled this objection, found that there had been serious bodily injury by a preponderance of the evidence, and imposed a 25-year sentence. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit took the view that the enhanced provisions were merely sentencing factors that did not need to be set forth in the indictment or submitted to the jury. It therefore affirmed this aspect of Jones's conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court then agreed to review the case. Majority opinion The federal carjacking statute, , reads: > Whoever, possessing a firearm as defined in section 921 of [Title 18], takes > a motor vehicle that has been transported, shipped, or received in > interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by > force and violence or by intimidation, or attempts to do so, shall‚Äî # be > fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both, # if > serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 of [Title 18]) results, be > fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 25 years, or both, and > #if death results, be fined under this title or be imprisoned for any number > of years up to life, or both. The Court ultimately held that the additional elements specified in subsections (2) and (3)--serious bodily injury and death--were elements of greater crimes that had to be charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court has never defined what makes a certain fact an \\"element\\" subject to the Sixth Amendment jury-trial requirement, as opposed to a mere \\"sentencing factor\\" not subject to the requirement. And the Court began by conceding that \\"at first glance\\" the three subsections were mere sentencing factors. Yet \\"countervailing structural considerations\\" led the Court to conclude that the additional facts in subsections (2) and (3) were in fact elements of two greater crimes. Reading the text closely, the Court observed that, since none of the numbered subsections can stand by itself as defining a crime, neither can the first paragraph. \\"In isolation, it would merely describe some very obnoxious behavior, leaving any reader assuming that it must be a crime, but never being actually told that it is. Only the numbered subsidiary provisions complete the thought.\\" Even so, such a close reading of the statutory text only helps to infer congressional intent. \\"If a given statute is unclear about treating... a fact as element or penalty aggravator, it makes sense to look at what other statutes have done, on the fair assumption that Congress is unlikely to intend any radical departures from past practice without making a point of saying so.\\" In Almendarez-Torres v. United States, , Congress's nearly uniform history of treating recidivism as a sentencing factor led the Court to conclude that the aggravating fact there--a prior conviction for certain crimes--was merely a sentencing factor exempt from the jury-trial requirement of the Sixth Amendment. By contrast, Congress has made \\"serious bodily injury\\" an element of many crimes, such as assault by a member of the armed forces, ; violence at international airports, ; and genocide, . Furthermore, carjacking is a species of robbery, and hence both Congress and state legislatures have traditionally treated serious bodily injury as an element of a more serious robbery crime. Both the Government and the Ninth Circuit had identified statements of members of Congress that suggested, in their opinion, Congress's intent to make \\"serious bodily injury\\" a sentencing factor. The Court was not persuaded, for some members had used the phrase \\"penalty enhancement\\", which the Court did not take to mean precisely the same thing as \\"sentencing factor\\". The fact that other members had referred to the crime of carjacking, as opposed to the crimes of carjacking, also had little significance for the Court. Ultimately, there was no reason to believe that in this case Congress had abandoned any of the models it had previously employed. Although there were arguments to be made in favor of treating \\"serious bodily injury\\" as a sentencing factor, the rule that statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional difficulties counseled in favor of treating it as an element of the crime. In Mullaney v. Wilbur, , the Court had held that a state could not define murder so as to require the defendant to affirmatively prove that he had acted in the heat of passion, so as to reduce the crime to manslaughter. In light of the \\"centuries-old common law recognition of malice as the fact distinguishing murder from manslaughter\\" and of the \\"widely held modern view that heat of passion, once raised by the evidence, was a subject of the State's burden,\\" due process required the state to bear the burden of proving absence of heat of passion. Otherwise, the state could \\"manipulate its way out\\" of the requirement that it prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In Patterson v. New York, , however, the Court had held that New York's definition of homicide, which had no malice element, did not improperly force the defendant to disprove that he had acted with malice. New York was free to define homicide without reference to a malice element without violating the traditional rule that the burden of proof in criminal cases rests on the state. And in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, , the Court held that a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for possessing a firearm was not subject to the jury-trial and proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirement, because it did not increase the maximum punishment to which the defendant was exposed. The distinguishing factor between Mullaney on the one hand and Patterson and McMillan on the other was that the fact in question exposed the defendant to a greater punishment. So too in this case, the facts of \\"serious bodily injury\\" or death exposed the defendant charged with federal carjacking to greater punishment than if those facts were not proved. Furthermore, removing these determinations from the jury's purview was not consistent with the role of the jury in the 18th century, which had tremendous control over the punishment a defendant would suffer. Thus, to avoid any unnecessary tension with Mullaney, Patterson, and McMillan, the Court held that these facts were elements of separate federal carjacking crimes. Dissenting opinion Justice Kennedy faulted the Court for skewing a simple question of statutory interpretation by invoking the \\"specter of grave and doubtful constitutional interpretations\\". He believed that the Court's textual analysis was incorrect, and that the constitutional rule the Court formulated would \\"upset the proper federal balance\\" of power between the judiciary and the legislature. As far as the textual analysis was concerned, the fact that the opening paragraph was complete in itself, and that the first subsection added no new facts, led Kennedy to conclude that the other two were mere sentencing enhancements. \\"Serious bodily harm\\", like recidivism, was \\"as typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine\\"; indeed, Kennedy pointed to the laws of several states that made the magnitude of harm to the victim or victims the basis for increased criminal punishment. Significant differences between the structure of the federal carjacking statute and both the other federal robbery statutes and the state statutes on which the majority relied also suggested to Kennedy that the text of the federal carjacking statute made \\"serious bodily injury\\" a sentencing factor. Because, for Kennedy, the text of the statute was not clearly susceptible to two different interpretations, there was no need to invoke the principle of constitutional avoidance as the majority did. In any event, the constitutional rule the Court articulated could too easily be circumvented, simply by rewriting the statute using slightly different words. The requirements imposed by the Sixth Amendment should not depend on the vagaries of Congress's choice of words when it drafts a statute. And if that should be so, the Court should more clearly spell out what words and phrases Congress should use in order to trigger certain constitutional protections. Furthermore, Kennedy saw no difference of constitutional significance between recidivism, which the Court had already held was excluded from the set of facts to which the jury-trial requirement applies, and \\"serious bodily injury\\"; the mere \\"tradition\\" of doing so might justify this difference, if it were more clear that the carjacking statute were consistent with that tradition.

Biography Joseph Rapha√´l, \\"The Shepherd\\", 1934 Born in the town of Jackson, California on June 2, 1869, Raphael studied with Arthur F. Mathews at the California School of Design. In 1902 he entered the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, but then moved to the Acad√©mie Julian and studied under Jean-Paul Laurens. He spent parts of the next several years in the Netherlands, producing paintings in a dark style derived from the Dutch Masters. In 1906 his large oil La Fete du Bourgmestre received an honorable mention at the Paris Salon; it was subsequently purchased by a group of friends in San Francisco and given to the San Francisco Art Association. In 1910 he had a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Institute of Art; beginning in 1913 he had annual exhibitions at Helgesen Galleries, San Francisco. He would ship artworks to his San Francisco friend and patron Albert M. Bender, who bought some and encouraged friends to buy others. Raphael also participated in the annual group shows of the San Francisco Art Association. Before long he adopted a style borrowed from French Impressionism, eventually using broader, freer, more Post-Impressionist brushstrokes. By 1912 he was married and living in Uccle, Belgium, a suburb of Brussels.http://lagunaartmuseum.org/joseph-raphael-american-expatriate/ He produced many paintings of the countryside near his home. As Raphael's international reputation grew, his family grew as well, to include four daughters and a son. His family frequently appeared in his figurative works. By the early 1930s Raphael and his family were living in a suburb of Leiden, Holland, and he painted often in nearby Bruges. In 1939, with World War II approaching, he returned to San Francisco, where he lived and maintained a studio on Sutter Street until his death on December 11, 1950. Known primarily as a painter, Raphael was also a skilled printmaker, creating numerous etchings and color woodcuts of European and San Francisco Bay Area scenes.

The synthesis of cyclin D is initiated during G1 and drives the G1/S phase transition. Cyclin D protein is anywhere from 155 (in zebra mussel) to 477 (in Drosophila) amino acids in length. Once cells reach a critical cell size (and if no mating partner is present in yeast) and if growth factors and mitogens (for multicellular organism) or nutrients (for unicellular organism) are present, cells enter the cell cycle. In general, all stages of the cell cycle are chronologically separated in humans and are triggered by cyclin-Cdk complexes which are periodically expressed and partially redundant in function. Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that form holoenzymes with cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdk), which they activate. The abundance of cyclins is generally regulated by protein synthesis and degradation through an APC/C dependent pathway. Cyclin D is one of the major cyclins produced in terms of its functional importance. It interacts with four Cdks: Cdk2, 4, 5, and 6. In proliferating cells, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex accumulation is of great importance for cell cycle progression. Namely, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex partially phosphorylates retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), whose inhibition can induce expression of some genes (for example: cyclin E) important for S phase progression. Drosophila and many other organisms only have one cyclin D protein. In mice and humans, two more cyclin D proteins have been identified. The three homologues, called cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 are expressed in most proliferating cells and the relative amounts expressed differ in various cell types.  Homologues  The most studied homologues of cyclin D are found in yeast and viruses. The yeast homologue of cyclin D, referred to as CLN3, interacts with Cdc28 (cell division control protein) during G1. In viruses, like Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 (Herpesvirus saimiri) and Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8/Kaposi's sarcoma- associated herpesvirus) cyclin D homologues have acquired new functions in order to manipulate the host cell's metabolism to the viruses‚Äô benefit. Viral cyclin D binds human Cdk6 and inhibits Rb by phosphorylating it, resulting in free transcription factors which result in protein transcription that promotes passage through G1 phase of the cell cycle. Other than Rb, viral cyclin D-Cdk6 complex also targets p27Kip, a Cdk inhibitor of cyclin E and A. In addition, viral cyclin D-Cdk6 is resistant to Cdk inhibitors, such as p21CIP1/WAF1 and p16INK4a which in human cells inhibits Cdk4 by preventing it from forming an active complex with cyclin D.  Structure  Cyclin D possesses a tertiary structure similar to other cyclins called the cyclin fold. This contains a core of two compact domains with each having five alpha helices. The first five-helix bundle is a conserved cyclin box, a region of about 100 amino acid residues on all cyclins, which is needed for Cdk binding and activation. The second five-helix bundle is composed of the same arrangement of helices, but the primary sequence of the two subdomains is distinct. All three D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) have the same alpha 1 helix hydrophobic patch. However, it is composed of different amino acid residues as the same patch in cyclins E, A, and B.  Function  Growth factors stimulate the Ras/Raf/ERK that induce cyclin D production. One of the members of the pathways, MAPK activates a transcription factor Myc, which alters transcription of genes important in cell cycle, among which is cyclin D. In this way, cyclin D is synthesized as long as the growth factor is present. Cyclin D levels in proliferating cells are sustained as long as the growth factors are present, a key player for G1/S transition is active cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes. Cyclin D has no effect on G1/S transition unless it forms a complex with Cdk 4 or 6. = G1/S transition = One of the best known substrates of cyclin D/Cdk4 and -6 is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). Rb is an important regulator of genes responsible for progression through the cell cycle, in particular through G1/S phase. One model proposes that cyclin D quantities, and thus cyclin D- Cdk4 and -6 activity, gradually increases during G1 rather than oscillating in a set pattern as do S and M cyclins. This happens in response to sensors of external growth-regulatory signals and cell growth, and Rb is phosphorylated as a result. Rb reduces its binding to E2F and thereby allows E2F-mediated activation of the transcription of cyclin E and cyclin A, which bind to Cdk1 and Cdk2 respectively to create complexes that continue with Rb phosphorylation. Cyclin A and E dependent kinase complexes also function to inhibit the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C activating subunit Cdh1 through phosphorylation, which stabilizes substrates such as cyclin A. The coordinated activation of this sequence of interrelated positive feedback loops through cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases drives commitment to cell division to and past the G1/S checkpoint. Another model proposes that cyclin D levels remain nearly constant through G1. Rb is mono-phosphorylated during early to mid-G1by cyclin D-Cdk4,6, opposing the idea that its activity gradually increases. Cyclin D dependent monophosphorylated Rb still interacts with E2F transcription factors in a way that inhibits transcription of enzymes that drive the G1/S transition. Rather, E2F dependent transcription activity increases when that of Cdk2 increases and hyperphosphorylates Rb towards the end of G1. Rb may not be the only target for cyclin D to promote cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. The cyclin D-Cdk4,6, complex, through phosphorylation and inactivation of metabolic enzymes, also influences cell survival. Through close analysis of different Rb-docking helices, a consensus helix sequence motif was identified, which can be utilized to identify potential non-canonical substrates that cyclin D-Cdk4,6 could use to promote proliferation. = Docking to Rb = RxL- and LxCxE- based docking mutations broadly affect cyclin-Cdk complexes. Mutations of key Rb residues previously observed to be needed for Cdk complex docking interactions result in reduced overall kinase activity towards Rb. The LxCxE binding cleft in the Rb pocket domain, which has been shown to interact with proteins such as cyclin D and viral oncoproteins, has only a marginal 1.7 fold reduction in phosphorylation by cyclin D-Cdk4,6 when removed. Similarly, when the RxL motif, shown to interact with the S phase cyclins E and A, is removed, cyclin D-Cdk4,6 activity has a 4.1 fold reduction. Thus, the RxL- and LxCxE based docking sites have interactions with cyclin D-Cdk4,6 like they do with other cyclins, and removal of them have modest a modest effect in G1 progression. Cyclin D-Cdk 4,6 complexes target Rb for phosphorylation through docking a C-terminal helix. When the final 37 amino acid residues are truncated, it had previously been shown that Rb phosphorylation levels are reduced and G1 arrest is induced. Kinetic assays have shown that with the same truncation, the reduction of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D1-Cdk4,6 is 20 fold and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) is significantly increased. The phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin B-Cdk1, and cyclin E-Cdk2 are unaffected. The C terminus has a stretch of 21 amino acids with alpha-helix propensity. Deletion of this helix or disruption of it via proline residue substitutions also show a significant reduction in Rb phosphorylation. The orientation of the residues, along with the acid-base properties and polarities are all critical for docking. Thus, the LxCxE, RxL, and helix docking sites all interact with different parts of cyclin D, but disruption of any two of the three mechanism can disrupt the phosphorylation of Rb in vitro. The helix binding, perhaps the most important, functions as a structural requirement. It makes evolving more difficult, leading the cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex to have relatively small number of substrates relative to other cyclin-Cdk complexes. Ultimately this contributes to the adequate phosphorylation of a key target in Rb. All six cyclin D-Cdk4,6 complexes (cyclin D1/D2/D3 with Cdk4/6) target Rb for phosphorylation through helix- based docking. The shared Œ± 1 helix hydrophobic patch that all cyclin D's have is not responsible for recognizing the C-terminal helix. Rather, it recognizes the RxL sequences that are linear, including those on Rb. Through experiments with purified cyclin D1-Cdk2, it was concluded that the helix docking site likely lies on cyclin D rather than the Cdk4,6. As a result, likely another region on cyclin D recognizes the Rb C-terminal helix. Since Rb's C ‚Äì terminal helix exclusively binds cyclin D-Cdk4,6 and not other cell cycle dependent cyclin-Cdk complexes, through experiments mutating this helix in HMEC cells, it has been conclusively shown that the cyclin D ‚Äì Rb interaction is critical in the following roles (1) promoting the G1/S transition (2) allowing Rb dissociation from chromatin, and (3) E2F1 activation.  Regulation  = In vertebrates = Cyclin D is regulated by the downstream pathway of mitogen receptors via the Ras/MAP kinase and the Œ≤-catenin-Tcf/LEF pathways and PI3K. The MAP kinase ERK activates the downstream transcription factors Myc, AP-1 and Fos which in turn activate the transcription of the Cdk4, Cdk6 and cyclin D genes, and increase ribosome biogenesis. Rho family GTPases, integrin linked kinase and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activate cyclin D gene in response to integrin. p27kip1 and p21cip1 are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) which negatively regulate CDKs. However they are also promoters of the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex. Without p27 and p21, cyclin D levels are reduced and the complex is not formed at detectable levels. In eukaryotes, overexpression of translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) leads to an increased level of cyclin D protein and increased amount of cyclin D mRNA outside of the nucleus. This is because eIF4E promotes the export of cyclin D mRNAs out of the nucleus. Inhibition of cyclin D via i.a. inactivation or degradation leads to cell cycle exit and differentiation. Inactivation of cyclin D is triggered by several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein (CKIs) like the INK4 family (e.g. p14, p15, p16, p18). INK4 proteins are activated in response to hyperproliferative stress response that inhibits cell proliferation due to overexpression of e.g. Ras and Myc. Hence, INK4 binds to cyclin D- dependent CDKs and inactivates the whole complex. Glycogen synthase kinase three beta, GSK3Œ≤, causes Cyclin D degradation by inhibitory phosphorylation on threonine 286 of the Cyclin D protein. GSK3Œ≤ is negatively controlled by the PI3K pathway in form of phosphorylation, which is one of several ways in which growth factors regulate cyclin D. Amount of cyclin D in the cell can also be regulated by transcriptional induction, stabilization of the protein, its translocation to the nucleus and its assembly with Cdk4 and Cdk6. It has been shown that the inhibition of cyclin D (cyclin D1 and 2, in particular) could result from the induction of WAF1/CIP1/p21 protein by PDT. By inhibiting cyclin D, this induction also inhibits Ckd2 and 6. All these processes combined lead to an arrest of the cell in G0/G1 stage. There are two ways in which DNA damage affects Cdks. Following DNA damage, cyclin D (cyclin D1) is rapidly and transiently degraded by the proteasome. This degradation causes release of p21 from Cdk4 complexes, which inactivates Cdk2 in a p53-independent manner. Another way in which DNA damage targets Cdks is p53-dependent induction of p21, which inhibits cyclin E-Cdk2 complex. In healthy cells, wild-type p53 is quickly degraded by the proteasome. However, DNA damage causes it to accumulate by making it more stable. = In yeast = A simplification in yeast is that all cyclins bind to the same Cdc subunit, the Cdc28. Cyclins in yeast are controlled by expression, inhibition via CKIs like Far1, and degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.  Role in cancer  Given that many human cancers happen in response to errors in cell cycle regulation and in growth factor dependent intracellular pathways, involvement of cyclin D in cell cycle control and growth factor signaling makes it a possible oncogene. In normal cells overproduction of cyclin D shortens the duration of G1 phase only, and considering the importance of cyclin D in growth factor signaling, defects in its regulation could be responsible for absence of growth regulation in cancer cells. Uncontrolled production of cyclin D affects amounts of cyclin D-Cdk4 complex being formed, which can drive the cell through the G0/S checkpoint, even when the growth factors are not present. Evidence that cyclin D1 is required for tumorigenesis includes the finding that inactivation of cyclin D1 by anti-sense or gene deletion reduced breast tumor and gastrointestinal tumor growth in vivo. Cyclin D1 overexpression is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumorigenesis, attributed to the induction of cell proliferation, increased cell survival, induction of chromosomal instability, restraint of autophagy and potentially non-canonical functions. Overexpression is induced as a result of gene amplification, growth factor or oncogene induced expression by Src, Ras, ErbB2, STAT3, STAT5, impaired protein degradation, or chromosomal translocation. Gene amplification is responsible for overproduction of cyclin D protein in bladder cancer and esophageal carcinoma, among others. In cases of sarcomas, colorectal cancers and melanomas, cyclin D overproduction is noted, however, without the amplification of the chromosomal region that encodes it (chromosome 11q13, putative oncogene PRAD1, which has been identified as a translocation event in case of mantle cell lymphoma). In parathyroid adenoma, cyclin D hyper-production is caused by chromosomal translocation, which would place expression of cyclin D (more specifically, cyclin D1) under an inappropriate promoter, leading to overexpression. In this case, cyclin D gene has been translocated to the parathyroid hormone gene, and this event caused abnormal levels of cyclin D. The same mechanisms of overexpression of cyclin D is observed in some tumors of the antibody- producing B cells. Likewise, overexpression of cyclin D protein due to gene translocation is observed in human breast cancer. Additionally, the development of cancer is also enhanced by the fact that retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), one of the key substrates of cyclin D-Cdk 4/6 complex, is quite frequently mutated in human tumors. In its active form, Rb prevents crossing of the G1 checkpoint by blocking transcription of genes responsible for advances in cell cycle. Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex phosphorylates Rb, which inactivates it and allows for the cell to go through the checkpoint. In the event of abnormal inactivation of Rb, in cancer cells, an important regulator of cell cycle progression is lost. When Rb is mutated, levels of cyclin D and p16INK4 are normal. Another regulator of passage through G1 restriction point is Cdk inhibitor p16, which is encoded by INK4 gene. P16 functions in inactivating cyclin D/Cdk 4 complex. Thus, blocking transcription of INK4 gene would increase cyclin D/Cdk4 activity, which would in turn result in abnormal inactivation of Rb. On the other hand, in case of cyclin D in cancer cells (or loss of p16INK4) wild-type Rb is retained. Due to the importance of p16INK/cyclin D/Cdk4 or 6/Rb pathway in growth factor signaling, mutations in any of the players involved can give rise to cancer.  Mutant phenotype  Studies with mutants suggest that cyclins are positive regulators of cell cycle entry. In yeast, expression of any of the three G1 cyclins triggers cell cycle entry. Since cell cycle progression is related to cell size, mutations in Cyclin D and its homologues show a delay in cell cycle entry and thus, cells with variants in cyclin D have bigger than normal cell size at cell division. p27‚àí/‚àí knockout phenotype show an overproduction of cells because cyclin D is not inhibited anymore, while p27‚àí/‚àí and cyclin D‚àí/‚àí knockouts develop normally.

Cohomological dimension of a group  As most cohomological invariants, the cohomological dimension involves a choice of a \\"ring of coefficients\\" R, with a prominent special case given by R = Z, the ring of integers. Let G be a discrete group, R a non-zero ring with a unit, and RG the group ring. The group G has cohomological dimension less than or equal to n, denoted cdR(G) ‚â§ n, if the trivial RG-module R has a projective resolution of length n, i.e. there are projective RG-modules P0, ..., Pn and RG-module homomorphisms dk: Pk\\\\toPk ‚àí 1 (k = 1, ..., n) and d0: P0\\\\toR, such that the image of dk coincides with the kernel of dk ‚àí 1 for k = 1, ..., n and the kernel of dn is trivial. Equivalently, the cohomological dimension is less than or equal to n if for an arbitrary RG-module M, the cohomology of G with coefficients in M vanishes in degrees k > n, that is, Hk(G,M) = 0 whenever k > n. The p-cohomological dimension for prime p is similarly defined in terms of the p-torsion groups Hk(G,M){p}.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.136 The smallest n such that the cohomological dimension of G is less than or equal to n is the cohomological dimension of G (with coefficients R), which is denoted n=\\\\operatorname{cd}_{R}(G).

As shown by John Stallings (for finitely generated group) and Richard Swan (in full generality), this property characterizes free groups. This result is known as the Stallings‚ÄìSwan theorem.

More generally, the same is true for groups with nontrivial torsion. Now consider the case of a general ring R. * A group G has cohomological dimension 0 if and only if its group ring RG is semisimple.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family of Ser/Thr protein kinases. This protein kinase is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae cdc28, and S. pombe cdc2, also known as Cdk1 in humans. It is a catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase complex, whose activity is restricted to the G1-S phase of the cell cycle, where cells make proteins necessary for mitosis and replicate their DNA. This protein associates with and is regulated by the regulatory subunits of the complex including cyclin E or A. Cyclin E binds G1 phase Cdk2, which is required for the transition from G1 to S phase while binding with Cyclin A is required to progress through the S phase. Its activity is also regulated by phosphorylation. Multiple alternatively spliced variants and multiple transcription initiation sites of this gene have been reported. The role of this protein in G1-S transition has been recently questioned as cells lacking Cdk2 are reported to have no problem during this transition.  Dispensability in normally functioning tissue  Original cell-culture based experiments demonstrated cell cycle arrest at the G1-S transition resulting from the deletion of Cdk2. Later experiments showed that Cdk2 deletions lengthened the G1 phase of the cell cycle in mouse embryo fibroblasts. However, they still entered S phase after this period and were able to complete the remaining phases of the cell cycle. When Cdk2 was deleted in mice, the animals remained viable despite a reduction in body size. However, meiotic function of both male and female mice was inhibited. This suggests that Cdk2 is non-essential for the cell cycle of healthy cells, but essential for meiosis and reproduction. Cells in Cdk2 knockout mice likely undergo fewer divisions, contributing to the reduction in body size. Germ cells also stop dividing at prophase of meiosis, leading to reproductive sterility. Cdk1 is now believed to compensate for many aspects of Cdk2 deletion, except for meiotic function.  Mechanism of activation  Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 is structured in two lobes. The lobe beginning at the N-terminus (N-lobe) contains many beta sheets, while the C-terminus lobe (C-lobe) is rich in alpha helices. Cdk2 is capable of binding to many different cyclins, including cyclins A, B, E, and possibly C. Recent studies suggest Cdk2 binds preferentially to cyclins A and E, while Cdk1 prefers cyclins A and B. Cdk2 (blue) and its binding partner, cyclin A (red).; Cdk2 becomes active when a cyclin protein (either A or E) binds at the active site located between the N and C lobes of the kinase. Due to the location of the active site, partner cyclins interact with both lobes of Cdk2. Cdk2 contains an important alpha helix located in the C lobe of the kinase, called the C-helix or the PSTAIRE-helix. Hydrophobic interactions cause the C-helix to associate with another helix in the activating cyclin. Activation induces a conformational change where the helix rotates and moves closer to the N-lobe. This allows the glutamic acid located on the C-helix to form an ion pair with a nearby lysine side chain. The significance of this movement is that it brings the side chain of Glu 51 , which belongs to a triad of catalytic site residues conserved in all eukaryotic kinases, into the catalytic site. This triad (Lys 33, Glu 51 and Asp 145) is involved in ATP phosphate orientation and magnesium coordination, and is thought to be critical for catalysis. This conformational change also relocates the activation loop to the C-lobe, revealing the ATP binding site now available for new interactions. Finally, the Threonine-160 residue is exposed and phosphorylated as the C-lobe activation segment is displaced from the catalytic site and the threonine residue is no longer sterically hindered. The phosphorylated threonine residue creates stability in the final enzyme conformation. It is important to note that throughout this activation process, cyclins binding to Cdk2 do not undergo any conformational change. Cdk2 (blue) and its binding partner cyclin E (orange).;  Role in DNA replication  The success of the cell division process is dependent on the precise regulation of processes at both cellular and tissue levels. Complex interactions between proteins and DNA within the cell allow genomic DNA to be passed to daughter cells. Interactions between cells and extracellular matrix proteins allow new cells to be incorporated into existing tissues. At the cellular level, the process is controlled by different levels of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their partner cyclins. Cells utilize various checkpoints as a means of delaying cell cycle progression until it can repair defects. Cdk2 is active during G1 and S phase of the cell cycle, and therefore acts as a G1-S phase checkpoint control. Prior to G1 phase, levels of Cdk4 and Cdk6 increase along with cyclin D. This allows for the partial phosphorylation of Rb, and partial activation of E2F at the beginning of G1 phase, which promotes cyclin E synthesis and increased Cdk2 activity. At the end of G1 phase, the Cdk2/Cyclin E complex reaches maximum activity and plays a significant role in the initiation of S phase. Other non-Cdk proteins also become active during the G1-S phase transition. For example, the retinoblastoma (Rb) and p27 proteins are phosphorylated by Cdk2 ‚Äì cyclin A/E complexes, fully deactivating them. This allows E2F transcription factors to express genes that promote entry into S phase where DNA is replicated prior to division. Additionally, NPAT, a known substrate of the Cdk2-Cyclin E complex, functions to activate histone gene transcription when phosphorylated. This increases the synthesis of histone proteins (the major protein component of chromatin), and subsequently supports the DNA replication stage of the cell cycle. Finally, at the end of S phase, the ubiquitin proteasome degrades cyclin E.  Cancer cell proliferation  Although Cdk2 is mostly dispensable in the cell cycle of normally functioning cells, it is critical to the abnormal growth processes of cancer cells. The CCNE1 gene produces cyclin E, one of the two major protein binding partners of Cdk2. Overexpression of CCNE1 occurs in many tumor cells, causing the cells to become dependent on Cdk2 and cyclin E. Abnormal cyclin E activity is also observed in breast, lung, colorectal, gastric, and bone cancers, as well as in leukemia and lymphoma. Likewise, abnormal expression of cyclin A2 is associated with chromosomal instability and tumor proliferation, while inhibition leads to decreased tumor growth. Therefore, CDK2 and its cyclin binding partners represent possible therapeutic targets for new cancer therapeutics. Pre-clinical models have shown preliminary success in limiting tumor growth, and have also been observed to reduce side effects of current chemotherapy drugs. Identifying selective Cdk2 inhibitors is difficult due to the extreme similarity between the active sites of Cdk2 and other Cdks, especially Cdk1. Cdk1 is the only essential cyclin dependent kinase in the cell cycle, and inhibition could lead to unintended side effects. Most CDK2 inhibitor candidates target the ATP binding site and can be divided into two main subclasses: type I and type II. Type I inhibitors competitively target the ATP binding site in its active state. Type II inhibitors target CDK2 in its unbound state, either occupying the ATP binding site or hydrophobic pocket within the kinase. Type II inhibitors are believed to be more selective. Recently, the availability of new CDK crystal structures led to the identification of a potential allosteric binding site near the C-helix. Inhibitors of this allosteric site are classified as type III inhibitors. Another possible target is the T-loop of CDK2. When cyclin A binds to CDK2, the N-terminal lobe rotates to activate the ATP binding site and switch the position of the activation loop, called the T-loop. Inhibitors Known CDK inhibitors are p21Cip1 (CDKN1A) and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B). Drugs that inhibit Cdk2 and arrest the cell cycle, such as GW8510 and the experimental cancer drug seliciclib, may reduce the sensitivity of the epithelium to many cell cycle- active antitumor agents and, therefore, represent a strategy for prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia.

CDK family members are highly similar to the gene products of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc28, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2, and are known to be important regulators of cell cycle progression in the point of regulation named R or restriction point. This kinase is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex, important for the G1 phase progression and G1/S transition of the cell cycle and the complex is composed also by an activating sub-unit; the cyclin D. The activity of this kinase first appears in mid-G1 phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits including D-type cyclins and members of INK4 family of CDK inhibitors. This kinase, as well as CDK4, has been shown to phosphorylate, and thus regulate the activity of, tumor suppressor Retinoblastoma protein making CDK6 an important protein in cancer development.  Structure  The CDK6 gene is conserved in eukaryotes, including the budding yeast and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The CDK6 gene is located on chromosome 7 in humans. The gene spans 231,706 base pairs and encodes a 326 amino acid protein with a kinase function. The gene is overexpressed in cancers like lymphoma, leukemia, medulloblastoma and melanoma associated with chromosomal rearrangements. The CDK6 protein contains a catalytic core composed of a serine/threonine domain. This protein also contains an ATP-binding pocket, inhibitory and activating phosphorylation sites, a PSTAIRE-like cyclin-binding domain and an activating T-loop motif. After binding the Cyclin in the PSTAIRE helix, the protein changes its conformational structure to expose the phosphorylation motif. The protein can be found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, however most of the active complexes are found in the nucleus of proliferating cells.  Function = Cell cycle = In 1994, Matthew Meyerson and Ed Harlow investigated the product of a close analogous gene of CDK4. This gene, identified as PLSTIRE was translated into a protein that interacted with the cyclins CD1, CD2 and CD3 (same as CDK4), but that was different from CDK4; the protein was then renamed CDK6 for simplicity. In mammalian cells, cell cycle is activated by CDK6 in the early G1 phaseHarvey Lodish et al., Molecular Cell Biology. 4th Edition., 2000, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21497/. through interactions with cyclins D1, D2 and D3. There are many changes in gene expression that are regulated through this enzyme. After the complex is formed, the C-CDK6 enzymatic complex phosphorylates the protein pRb. After its phosphorylation, pRb releases its binding partner E2F, a transcriptional activator, which in turn activates DNA replication. The CDK6 complex ensures a point of switch to commit to division responding to external signals, like mitogens and growth factors. CDK6 is involved in a positive feedback loop that activates transcription factors through a reaction cascade. Importantly, these C-CDK complexes act as a kinase, phosphorylating and inactivating the protein of Rb and p-Rb related ‚Äúpocket proteins‚Äù p107 and p130. While doing this, the CDK6 in conjunction with CDK4, act as a switch signal that first appears in G1, directing the cell towards S phase of the cell cycle. CDK6 is important for the control of G1 to S phase transition. However, in recent years, new evidence proved that the presence of CDK6 is not essential for proliferation in every cell type,Katarzyna Kozar and Piotr Sicinski, \\"Cell Cycle Progression without Cyclin D-CDK4 and Cyclin D-CDK6 Complexes,\\" Cell Cycle 4, no. 3 (March 2005): 388‚Äì91 the cell cycle has a complex circuitry of regulation and the role of CDK6 might be more important in certain cell types than in others, where CDK4 or CDK2 can act as protein kinases compensating its role. = Cellular development = In mutant Knockout mice of CDK6, the hematopoietic function is impaired, regardless of otherwise organism normal development. This might hint additional roles of CDK6 in the development of blood components. There are additional functions of CDK6 not associated with its kinase activity. For example, CDK6 is involved in the differentiation of T cells, acting as an inhibitor of differentiation.Martha J Grossel and Philip W Hinds, \\"From Cell Cycle to Differentiation: An Expanding Role for cdk6,\\" Cell Cycle 5, no. 3 (February 2006): 266‚Äì70 Even though CDK6 and CDK4 share 71% amino acid identity, this role in differentiation is unique to CDK6. CDK6 has also been found to be important in the development of other cell lines, for example, CDK6 has a role in the alteration of the morphology of astrocytes and in the development of other stem cells. = DNA protection = CDK6 differs from CDK4 in other important roles. For example, CDK6 plays a role in the accumulation of the apoptosis proteins p53 and p130, this accumulation keeps cells from entering cell division if there is DNA damage, activating pro- apoptotic pathways. = Metabolic homeostasis = Studies in the metabolic control of cells have revealed yet another role of CDK6. This new role is associated with the balance of the oxidative and non-oxidative branches of the pentose pathway in cells. This pathway is a known route altered in cancer cells, when there is an aberrant overexpression of CDK6 and CDK4. The overexpression of these proteins provides the cancer cells with a new hallmark capability of cancer; the deregulation of the cell metabolism. = Centrosome stability = In 2013, researchers discovered yet another role of CDK6. There is evidence that CDK6 associates with the centrosome and controls organized division and cell cycle phases in neuron production. When the CDK6 gene is mutated in these developing lines, the centrosomes are not properly divided, this could lead to division problems such as aneuploidy, which in turns leads to health issues like primary microcephaly.  Mechanisms of regulation  CDK6 is positively regulated primarily by its union to the D cyclins D1, D2 and D3. If this subunit of the complex is not available, CDK6 is not active or available to phosphorylate the pRb substrate. An additional positive activator needed by CDK6 is the phosphorylation in a conserved threonine residue located in 177 position, this phosphorylation is done by the cdk-activating kinases, CAK. Additionally, CDK6 can be phosphorylated and activated by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus, stimulating the CDK6 over activation and uncontrolled cell proliferation. CDK6 is negatively regulated by binding to certain inhibitors that can be classified in two groups; CKIs or CIP/KIP family members like the protein p21 and p27 act blocking and inhibiting the assembled C-CDKs binding complex enzymes in their catalytic domain. Furthermore, inhibitors of the INK4 family members like p15, p16, p18 and p19 inhibit the monomer of CDK6, preventing the complex formation.  Clinical relevance  CDK6 is a protein kinase activating cell proliferation, it is involved in an important point of restriction in the cell cycle. For this reason, CDK6 and other regulators of the G1 phase of the cell cycle are known to be unbalanced in more than 80-90% of tumors. In cervical cancer cells, CDK6 function has been shown to be altered indirectly by the p16 inhibitor. CDK6 is also overexpressed in tumors that exhibit drug resistance, for example glioma malignancies exhibit resistance to chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ) when they have a mutation overexpressing CDK6. Likewise, the overexpression of CDK6 is also associated with resistance to hormone therapy using the anti oestrogen Fluvestrant in breast cancer. = Cancer = Loss of normal cell cycle control is the first step to developing different hallmarks of cancer; alterations of CDK6 can directly or indirectly affect the following hallmarks; disregulated cell cellular energetics, sustaining of proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors and inducing angiogenesis, for example, deregulation of CDK6 has been shown to be important in lymphoid malignancies by increasing angiogenesis, a hallmark of cancer. These features are reached through upregulation of CDK6 due to chromosome alterations or epigenetic dysregulations. Additionally, CDK6 might be altered through genomic instability, a mechanism of downregulation of tumor suppressor genes; this represents another evolving hallmark of cancer. = Medulloblastoma = Medulloblastoma is the most common cause of brain cancer in children. About a third of these cancers have upregulated CDK6, representing a marker for poor prognosis for this disease. Since it is so common for these cells to have alterations in CDK6, researchers are seeking for ways to downregulate CDK6 expression acting specifically in those cell lines. The MicroRNA (miR) -124 has successfully controlled cancer progression in an in-vitro setting for medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, researchers have found that it successfully reduces the growth of xenograft tumors in rat models. = As a drug target = The direct targeting of CDK6 and CDK4 should be used with caution in the treatment of cancer, because these enzymes are important for the cell cycle of normal cells as well. Furthermore, small molecules targeting these proteins might increase drug resistance events. However, these kinases have been shown to be useful as coadjuvants in breast cancer chemotherapy. Another indirect mechanism for the control of CDK6 expression, is the use of a mutated D-cyclin that binds with high affinity to CDK6, but does not induce its kinase activity. this mechanism was studied in the development of mammary tumorigenesis in rat cells, however, the clinical effects have not yet been shown in human patients.

This subterfuge was deemed necessary in order for Germany to be seen to meet the requirements of the Versailles Treaty. It completely revised German tactical and strategic doctrine and thereby conserved, re-energised and unified the military thinking and capability of the Reichswehr, later to become the Wehrmacht. Original establishment After World War I, the Versailles Treaty specified that the post-war German army could have a maximum strength of 100,000, of this number only 4000 could be officers. Article 160 determined: > The Great German General Staff and all similar organisations shall be > dissolved and may not be reconstituted in any form. In late 1919, soon after the treaty was signed, Major General Hans von Seeckt, head of the military expert group adjunct to the German delegation, initiated a programme to rethink and rewrite German doctrine as well as reorganise the Army to comply with the Versailles rules. On 1 October he became chief of the newly established Truppenamt agency within the Ministry of the Reichswehr. In 1920, when von Seeckt succeeded Walther Reinhardt as Head of the Army Command (Chef der Heeresleitung), this expanded to rebuilding a new army from scratch. When the General Staff was dissolved in 1919, its Operations Section became the Truppenamt whilst other sections of the Staff were transferred to government departments: the history section to the Interior Ministry Reich Archives, the Survey and Maps section to the Interior Ministry Survey Office and the Transportation section to the Transportation Ministry. The Economic and Political sections were placed directly under the control of the chief of the Army Command. Thus the core of the General Staff became the four new sections of the Truppenamt: *T1 (also Abteilung Landesverteidigung) the Army section (operations and planning) *T2 the organisation section *T3 (also Heeresstatistische Abteilung) the statistical section ‚Äî(actually intelligence agency) *T4 the training section. As von Seeckt said at the time \\"the form changes, the spirit remains the same\\".Corum, James S., The Roots of Blitzkrieg: Hans von Seeckt and German Military Reform, University of Kansas Press, 1992 page 35 Alongside the Truppenamt in the new army high command were the Weapons Office and branch inspectorates. The relationship between these three entities was very close since between them they determined materiel, doctrine and training. In the early 1920s, the Truppenamt contained a transportation section, T7 (there never was a T5 or T6). Altogether these three bodies contained two hundred officers, almost all ex-General Staff, who formed an efficient and practical organisation for guiding the rebuilding of the Reichswehr. Development of new strategies Von Seeckt on Reichswehr maneuvers, 1926 One week after the dissolution of the General Staff, von Seeckt started a programme to collect and analyse the experiences of the First World War and to create a new military doctrine for the Reichswehr. The new programme consisted of 57 committees which would study tactics, regulations, equipment and doctrine. This effort was seen as important to put the experience of war in a broad light and collect this experience whilst it was still fresh. The output of the committees was to be short, concise studies on the newly gained experiences and in particular (a) what new situations arose that had not been considered before; (b) how effective were pre-war views in dealing with these situations; (c) what guidelines were developed for new weaponry during the war; and (d) which new problems put forward by the war have not yet found a solution. This programme covered diverse topics from military justice and questions of troop morale to river crossings, flame throwers and the military weather service. Military leadership was a key focus with seven committees covering different levels and aspects. In order to cover these areas experienced officers were appointed to serve on the committees. These officers were often ex-General Staff but specialist experts were included even if they were not. The T4 section's job was to collect and review the committee outputs and to recommend changes to the committee structure, to military regulations and to doctrinal manuals. Seeing the intense effort being made by the Army, the Air Service within the Truppenamt embarked on a similar programme and by mid-1920 the manpower that made up all these committees was over 500 officers. Whilst all the big nations revised their tactics post-World War I, it is a notable contrast that Germany put its experienced General Staff officers of Captain and above to the task whilst others put juniors of limited experience. For example, the UK assigned the task of rewriting the infantry manual to Basil H Liddell Hart, a 24-year-old Lieutenant of limited experience. Even here, the War Office reinserted chapters from the 1911 manual where it deemed appropriate. Most of the output of the committees has been lost but where it still exists there is a clear link to the new regulations and manuals that started to be issued in 1921. By 1923, the major outputs of this work were completed and the results show up in new manuals issued from that time which demonstrate a high level of tactical thought. Experience from World War I was incorporated as seen in the new infantry regulation of October 1922 where 10-12 squads included a light machine gun with the rifle section and fluid fire-and-manoeuvre stormtroop tactics are endorsed. It is also important to note that the manuals do not limit themselves to the armaments allowed by the Versailles Treaty envisaging tactics using forbidden infantry cannons for example.Parts 1 & 3 Heeresdienstvorschrift 487, Verlag, 1923 It is here that we see explicit strategic capabilities being built into the new unified doctrines, so such things as cross-training requirements being built into regulations; e.g. transport troops being required to train a set number of wagon drivers as cannon gunners and as engineers specialising in bridges. Albert Kesselring, later a field marshal, served in both T1 and T4 at this critical time, as did many other influential generals, and described it as a professional schooling for him. Transition to the new Reichswehr With manuals and regulations now in place (even if under constant revision from this new base), the Truppenamt set about reshaping the new army to fit its treaty constraints and its new doctrinal approach. The \\"triangular\\" infantry division replaced the \\"square division\\", with no brigade-level staff and with three regiments instead of four. Numbers in support forces such as artillery, reconnaissance, transport and signals all increased, with control in many cases pushed down the organisation. All of this related to the new \\"war of movement\\" doctrine that had been adopted. The Wehrmacht infantry division in 1939 showed very few changes from the patterns outlined in 1921. The cavalry division was similarly reinforced with support arms and armoured cars, making it capable of independent operations deep behind enemy lines. The Truppenamt turned some of the Versailles limitations into advantages. The very limited number of officers forced it to rethink the roles at headquarters, and this dovetailed with the doctrine of decision at the front by those who can see the enemy. Correspondingly, despite a Versailles limit of 33 officers in a divisional HQ, the Germans planned to have 30 - in stark contrast to a US divisional staff of 79. Again, this fitted with a force which would be attacking and making many more decisions outside of the headquarters, which could therefore be leaner. The Versailles Treaty placed no limitations on NCO numbers, and by 1922 the Reichswehr had over 50% of enlisted manpower at NCO ranks, leaving only 36,000 privates. The high quality of German soldiers, made possible by the much reduced numbers forced by the treaty, meant that the Reichswehr could employ NCOs in junior-officer roles (as platoon leaders, for example). This had two effects: * When the Germans officially re-armed in 1933-34 they could easily promote these NCOs to officer positions as the army expanded. * A tradition developed of much greater leadership, responsibility and capability below the officer level, which fitted with the delegated- authority doctrine necessary for Bewegungskrieg (war of movement), which calls for independent judgement and fast local decision-making. The increased demands upon NCOs required the new army to treat them differently than the old Imperial had - in order to support them in their efforts. Hence all NCOs were now to have a barracks-room of their own and all soldiers were to be much better accommodated and trained than before. In the 1920s the Reichswehr often distributed soldiers throughout the country in battalion- and regiment-sized groups, only forming larger units for occasional exercises. This was part of the Truppenamt's plan to train squads, platoons and companies in the new regulations and doctrines and when ready then combining them in battalion and regimental exercises. The battalion and regimental exercises started in 1924, and the first divisional exercises in 1926. During this time the Truppenamt had the task of ensuring that old \\"trench warfare\\" and \\"positional warfare\\" tactics did not creep back into use. Cross-training r√©gimes were reviewed, long-length operational order-writing was eliminated, attack styles that took too long to prepare were eliminated. Innovation and flexibility for mobile warfare were stressed over the carefully planned methods used in static warfare.  Chiefs of Troop Office (1919‚Äì1935)   Footnotes  References * James S.

Biography Tanqueray was born in Littlehampton, Sussex. Tanqueray first became interested in the theatre and photography when he was at Tonbridge School (1920-1923) and won the school's Photographic prize. Through his contact with an ex-pupil of the Tonbridge School Hugh Cecil, Tanqueray began his photographic career as one of his pupils. Paul Tanqueray opened his first studio at 139, High Street, Kensington in 1925. As London's then youngest photographer, he was in a perfect position to document an era that had become obsessed with youth and modernism. During this time he employed an ex- Cambridge graduate as his assistant, Cecil Beaton, until Beaton was taken on by Vogue.THE BEATON GENERATION  Independent on Sunday, The  Find Articles at BNET.com Five years of success in Kensington led to a move the more fashionable West End of London at 8, Dover Street, near the Ritz Hotel. Tanqueray's photographs appeared regularly in the weekly Sketch and Tatler and most frequently inside and on the cover of Theatre World. His work, including Ethel Mannin and his 1929 and 1933 portraits of Anna May Wong, was also selected and hung at the annual London Salon of Photography. During the Second World War Tanqueray worked mainly with Chelsea Home Guard. After the war he re-opened his studio at 30, Thurloe Place in South Kensington, where his 1950's famous images included Elizabeth Seal, Dame Joan Plowright, and actress Claire Bloom. Tanqueray retired in 1965, and in two tranches donated his prints in 1975, and his negatives in 1983 to the National Portrait Gallery. Tanqueray died in September 1991.

Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties. Some southern and coastal counties, including Sagadahoc County, also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory, however. The unincorporated territory in Sagadahoc County consists of an island in the Kennebec River along the county's eastern edge, adjacent to the towns of Richmond and Bowdoinham, called Swan Island. The island covers about two and a quarter square miles of land. Swan Island was once incorporated as the town of Perkins, and is still sometimes referred to as \\"Perkins Township\\". Perkins disincorporated in 1918 due to population loss; its population has not reached double figures in any census since 1930, and it reported no population at all in the 2000 Census. Except for Swan Island, all of Sagadahoc County is incorporated. There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables below differentiate between towns and cities. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including Perkins, should yield the county total. (Note that, for censuses up through 1910, Perkins was an incorporated town.

Until 1919, its Romanian name used to be DanfalƒÉu, which was then Romanianized to the current official name.Transylvanian Toponym Book Until 1779, villagers were engaged in the operation of iron hammers, but in the 19th century it became a potters' village. Today, it has a black pottery factory. The village provided servicemen for the 7th Company of 1st Sz√©kely Infantry Regiment until 1851. Wood processing, animal-breeding and transportation were the main preoccupation of the villagers. The village administratively belonged to Cs√≠ksz√©k district in the Kingdom of Hungary until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within Cs√≠k County. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, the village, like the rest of Transylvania, became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the village was held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the village became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the village fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.  Geography  It is located 21 km north of the county seat where the K√∂d Brook enters the Olt River. The commune is cut by the road E 578 and a railway line. Its natural resources: iron ore, mercury, kaolin, cinnabar, mineral water. Demographics At the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 2,292; out of them, 99% were Hungarian, 0.6% were Romanian and 0.3% were Roma.Tab8.

It ran from Waterbury to Stowe, a distance of approximately . History An electric railroad between Stowe and Waterbury, connecting with the Central Vermont Railway, was authorized by the legislature of Vermont in 1865, 1872, 1888, and 1894. Not until 1897 were sufficient funds raised and construction started. A power plant was built at the south end of the Stowe town, outside of the village, along with a battery house just north of Colbyville village, and service began in 1898. The line operated three passenger cars with baggage areas, two freight motors, a single truck work car which was basically an open-air trolley, and a doubled-ended rotary snowplow. This last saw minimal service, as the unit damaged the track and neighboring structures, and was not effective at the Waterbury end of the railroad due to low current. One of the passenger cars was damaged in a wreck early on and removed from service almost immediately. Traffic on the line was never heavy, with the primary shipper being the Burt Lumber Company in Stowe, which shipped clapboards and other wood products to the Boston area. Damage from the 1927 hurricane-related flooding was minimal, but traffic declined further in the early 1930s, and the right-of-way was passed to the state of Vermont in 1932, which promptly turned much of the roadbed into the first concrete paved road in the state, Vermont Route 100. The corporate structure of the MMER remained until 1963, operating trucks which carried goods over the new concrete road from Stowe to the train freight station at Waterbury. Stations An 1897 timetable listed the following stops from south to north: *Waterbury, Vermont *Stowe, Vermont The Stowe terminus had a covered station in the back of a storefront. That building still stands on the south side of the main street in the village, but has been extensively renovated. Small stations were built at the side road leading to Moscow, Vermont, and in Waterbury Center. There was no station at the Waterbury end of the line, and passengers used the Central Vermont Railroad station (still in existence), and freight was carried to the freight depot. There was an interchange and boxcars and loads of coal made their way over the entire line by use of the freight motors.

The basic plotline serves as a showcase for Houdini's talent as an escapologist, stunt performer and aviator. As the story unfolds, a series of Houdini's trademark set-piece stunts and escapes are performed. When his tormentors chain him up and imprison him on numerous occasions, Houdini escapes. The film concludes with a climactic mid-air collision following an aircraft pursuit. Following the collision, Houdini is reunited with his fianc√©e. Plot Young newspaper reporter Harvey Hanford (Harry Houdini) is in love with Mary Cameron (Ann Forrest), the ward of his rich, eccentric Uncle Dudley Cameron (Thomas Jefferson), who opposes the match. Harvey becomes involved in a newspaper scheme to plant evidence for a fake murder of his uncle. Dudley Cameron is actually killed, however, and Harvey is framed and arrested for the murder. Jailed unjustly for a murder he did not commit, freeing himself, Harvey is able to pursue the actual killers. Confronting the gang, Harvey is overwhelmed, but using his amazing powers of escape to free himself in a series of remarkable escapes from handcuffs, chains and a straitjacket, culminating in a climactic mid-air aircraft collision. Following the collision, Harvey is vindicated and finally reunited with Mary.

The aerial sequences were to feature a new stunt, where Houdini would hang by a rope from an aircraft and drop into the cockpit of an aircraft flying below. In the media, Houdini claimed that he was \\"scorning the use of a stunt man\\".Pendo 1985, p. 4. In actuality, the film company advertised for a stunt double to take Houdini's place. Robert E. Kennedy, a former army air force flight instructor, applied and received a contract for the dangerous stunt.Wynne 1987, p. 11. =Mid-air collision= The mid-air collision in The Grim Game was not scripted. It was a real accident caught on film over the skies of Santa Monica, California. David E. Thompson was flying with stuntman Robert E. Kennedy, doubling Houdini, hanging from the landing gear. As the two Curtiss JN-4 \\"Jennys\\" lined up, a sudden gust of wind pushed Thompson's aircraft into the lower aircraft flown by Christopher Pickup, with his landing gear jamming into the top wing of the lower aircraft. As the two aircraft spun down, Thompson's aircraft flipped upside down while Al Wilson, flying the camera aircraft, followed the tangle of aircraft down. Both aircraft managed to free themselves at about 200 ft. and were able to land although Thompson's aircraft was still upside down. No one was killed, and the story was rewritten to incorporate the accident. Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic \\"caught on film\\" moment, claiming it was Houdini himself dangling from the aircraft.Silverman 1997, pp. 239‚Äì240. Reception The contemporary film review of The Grim Game in The New York Times, noted, \\"The familiar feats, with which he (Houdini) has entertained audiences for so many years, were more baffling than ever, and airplanes, high-powered motor cars, and heights of treetops were brought into service to give the audience the best possible thrill in stock. For the first time, too, Houdini combines love with his daredevil accomplishments, and throughout the picture his attractive young sweetheart is carried from the secret recesses of a wild hunting lodge, guarded by desperate-looking characters, to perilous heights in the clouds just out of reach of her courageous hero.\\" Ever the showman, Houdini himself appeared at the Broadway Theatre, New York, for the first screening, proclaiming that he would offer $1,000 to anyone \\"who could prove that the collision was not an authentic one.\\" He further detailed that the mid-air collision took place at 4,000 ft, a height that allowed both aircraft to recover and land safely.\\"The screen.\\" The New York Times, August 26, 1919.

The movement enjoyed support from Morocco and pro-Moroccan states in the Gulf region, and at the very least, it was allowed to organize in France.

Scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. It is perhaps the first symphony in B-flat major to use trumpets and drums, something which is thought to have been pioneered by Joseph Haydn (see Symphony No. 98). This symphony is in three movements: #Allegro con fuoco #Andante con espressione, in F major #Rondo. Presto molto The first movement, in sonata form, has for its first theme one of Haydn's most triadic themes, with the first violins not playing a note outside of the tonic chord until bar 13. 500px The second theme (starting at bar 40) is by contrast extremely scalar, moving primarily in seconds. The development uses a new theme to lead back to the recapitulation. Unlike Haydn's other slow movements in symphonies with trumpets and timpani, the timpani are not silent in this one (see Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 88). Bassoons and oboes take turns doubling the first violins on the melody. 500px The melody is for the most part entrusted to the first violins, but the first bassoon often doubles it an octave below (while the second bassoon sticks to the usual duty of doubling the cello line in unison). The third movement, a rondo, features dramatic contrasts of piano and forte in its main theme. 500px Discography Like the other symphonies of the 1788 set of six, this one is in the CPO disc with Johannes Goritzki conducting the New German Chamber Academy.

It is characterized as a logarithmic spiral because if one looks at it in plan view or aerially, it represents the same shape that is created from the logarithmic spiral relation. These beaches are also commonly referred to as ‚Äòhalf heart‚Äô or ‚Äòcrenulate‚Äô shaped bays, or ‚Äòheadland bays‚Äô.  Logarithmic spiral relation  Logarithmic Spiral The logarithmic spiral can be determined using the equation (written in polar coordinates): :r = e^{\\\\theta \\\\cot \\\\alpha} where: \\\\theta = the angle of rotation, is located between two lines drawn from the origin to any two points on the spiral. r = the ratio of the lengths between two lines that extend out from the origin. The two lines are given as R_O and R. So r also equals the ratio R/R_O. \\\\alpha = the angle between any line R from the origin and the line tangent to the spiral which is at the point where line R intersects the spiral. \\\\alpha is a constant for any given logarithmic spiral.  Spiral development  This type of beach forms due to the refraction of approaching waves and their diffraction by an upcoast headland. The approaching wave front curves as a result of wave diffraction at the headland, which in turn causes the shoreline to bend and yield a log spiral shape. Log spiral beaches are often on swell-dominated coasts where waves generally approach the shoreline from one main direction at an oblique angle. The oblique approaching waves refract and diffract into the \\"shadow zone\\" which can be considered a relatively sheltered hook of beach behind the headland. Increase in sediment size, wave height, berm height, and swash zone gradient from the up coast headland generally characterizes the concave seaward curved part of the beach.

The original congregation adopted the name ‚ÄúThe Wayside Chapel.‚Äù Until January 1, 1949 students from the Northwestern Bible School and Bethel College and Seminary actively led the small church. The congregation adopted the name \\"The Wayside Chapel,\\" and for the first six years the church was run by students and faculty of Northwestern Bible School and Bethel College and Seminary. On January 1, 1949, John D. Lundberg became the pastor of the church. During the early part of 1949 the church made plans to reorganize as a Baptist church because of a desire to affiliate with other churches and because of the need for financial assistance. The congregation affiliated itself with the Baptist General Conference. On June 12, 1949, the church officially became \\"Wooddale Baptist Church\\" of Richfield. There were 32 charter members. That same month, the church broke ground for a permanent church building, albeit just a basement, which would be occupied November 13, 1949. The church continued to grow and by 1954 the Sunday School had grown to an average attendance of 238. This led to further construction of a Christian Education space. In the fall of 1955, Lundberg left to take a new position in Florida. In April 1955, Paul Thompson became the new pastor. He began his ministry on July 1, 1956. On February 1, 1957, Pastor Paul Thompson died from injuries received in an automobile accident. In May 1957, Peter Unruh became the senior pastor. Continued growth led to duplicate Sunday morning worship services and plans for construction of new facilities which were ready for use September 13, 1959. In 1962, the church began having duplicate Sunday morning services again and began planning for additional expansion, completed on September 27, 1964. On January 1, 1977, Leith Anderson began his ministry at Wooddale. Anderson retired as senior pastor on December 31, 2011. During Anderson's tenure, Wooddale expanded in size, relocated from Richfield to Eden Prairie and began multiple styles of worship. In 2003, the Church joined Conservative Congregational Christian Conference.

On October 30, 1988 construction started on a new , 2000-seat worship center, complete with pipe organ and a steeple (to avoid the need for a beacon light on the top), and was finished in November 1990. The continued growth of the Church meant that more space was needed. In 1995, construction began to provide new classrooms for the church‚Äôs youth programs and office space for the expanding staff. In March 2000 a addition was dedicated. In the fall of 2000 the worship schedule was expanded to six services each weekend with a contemporary service on Saturday evening, and three contemporary services and two traditional services on Sunday morning.

This normally excludes uplift developed in the footwalls of later extensional faults, or uplift caused by mantle plumes. \\"Inversion\\" can also refer to individual faults, where an extensional fault is reactivated in the opposite direction to its original movement. The term negative inversion is also occasionally used to describe the reactivation of reverse faults and thrusts during extension. The term \\"inversion\\" simply refers to the fact that a relatively low-lying area is uplifted ‚Äì the rock sequence itself is not normally inverted. Formation Many inversion structures are caused by the direct reactivation of pre-existing extensional faults. In some cases only the deeper parts of the fault are reactivated and the shortening is accommodated over a much broader area in the shallow part of the section. The existing fault block still generally acts as a boundary to the uplift and the process is sometimes known as buttressing. The likelihood of fault reactivation depends on the dip of the existing fault plane. Lower angle faults are more favourable as the resolved shear stress on the plane is higher. When a listric fault, which increases in dip upwards, reactivates the uppermost part of the fault may be too steep and new reverse faults typically develop in the footwall of the existing fault. These are known as footwall shortcuts. =Varieties of Formation= Inversion tectonics is recognised to form as a result of: 1 Regional temporal variations in stress patterns within plates, resulting from forces caused by changes in plate boundary configuration, the blocking of subduction zones by buoyant crust (collision) and changes in relative motion at nearby plate boundaries. 2 Global, episodic, intraplate, stress changes from deviatoric compression during the collisional assembly of Pangaea-type continental configurations to deviatoric tension in assembled configurations to deviatoric compression in dispersed configurations. Inversions are commonly associated with rifted margin breakup unconformities caused by the transition from rift-phase tension to ridge push compression. 3 Local inversion in strike-slip rhombohedral pull-aparts as a natural consequence of alternating phases of transtension with negative flower structure and transpression with positive flower structure. 4 Complex alternating phases of extension and shortening at the margins of upper crustal rotational flakes in strike-slip zones. 5 Progressive diminution of the ratio of crustal to lithospheric thickness during slow extension causing whole basin uplift. 6 Uplift on lithospheric flexural arches and hotspots. 7 Body force mechanisms including salt mud diapirism, salt/mud decollement tectonics, gravity spreading, sliding and consequent relaying of heel extension to toe thrusting. 8 Inversion of strong negative isostatic gravity anomalies in confined deep basins caused by upper crustal stretching. Critical to whether a basin becomes inverted are, also, the timing of a compression phase relative to the initial basin-forming extensional event and the extensional strain rate. Short extensioncompression intervals and high extensional strain rates facilitate basin inversion. Inversion may be prevented by long intervals and low strain rates. Economic importance Anticlinal structures formed by inversion provide traps in many of the world's hydrocarbon provinces. The nature of inversion means that reservoir units often thicken and may increase in quality within the basin that is later inverted (e.g. the Ormen Lange gas field offshore mid-Norway).

It is south-southwest of Leuchars Junction, and east-northeast of Cupar on the A91 Stirling to St Andrews road. The village grew out of two smaller settlements (called Dairsiemuir and Osnaburgh), and developed principally around the industry of weaving. Since the late twentieth century it has become a dormitory settlement for nearby towns. The village may have derived its name of Osnaburgh from weaving osnaburg, a coarse linen or cotton, originally imported from Osnabr√ºck in Germany.

Nearby Dairsie Castle (now restored) dates from the early seventeenth century, and was briefly the residence of John Spottiswoode (1565-1639), Archbishop of St Andrews. King James VI stayed at Dairsie Castle following his escape from the Raid of Ruthven in June 1583. Dairsie Old Parish Church St Mary's Church was built by Archbishop Spottiswoode in 1621. The church is some distance from the village and ceased to be used for worship in 1966. It is now in private hands, and the parish worshippers use the former St Leonard's Church in the village. The congregation is united with St John's Church in Cupar. Local businesses include a small Village Shop and Post Office, a Petrol Station and Garage (also selling second hand vehicles) and The Dairise Inn currently trading as Rumbledethumps Restaurant. It has a small locals bar, a conservatory restaurant and a small function room / additional restaurant. History In 2014 a hoard of Roman hacksilver was found in a field at Dairsie. It is thought that the hacksilver was used by Roman soldiers to pay off the local Pictish tribes when they travelled through the area.

Plot Edgar Marsh, a shy librarian obsessed with erotica, becomes infatuated with his neighbour Betty Clare when he sees her undressing in her bedroom. He invites her to dinner, and although she clearly is uncomfortable with the attention he pays her, he showers her with jewelry and fantasizes about their future. Complications arise when he introduces her to his friend Carl Loomis, whom Betty finds far more attractive and appealing. After witnessing Carl and Betty together in her bedroom, Edgar bludgeons Carl to death with a poker and buries him beneath the floorboards in his piano room.

In December 2007 when the US intelligence community released the findings of an NIE stating that Iran had stopped its secret nuclear weapons program in 2003 (as opposed to the 2005 NIE which said they were continuing), some observers suspected that Asgari played some role in providing intelligence or prompting the reassessment; however, current officials have said that there was no single thing which prompted the reversal, though another source cited current diplomatic and security officials as saying that a defector was likely to be the cause of the new information. =Operation Orchard= On September 28 the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jareeda reported that Asgari provided information for the Israeli airstrike on September 6 in Syria, code-named Operation Orchard; this was echoed by the intelligence group Stratfor, which reported that Asgari \\"gave Israel the intelligence on Syria's missile program needed for the Syrian airstrike.\\" In March 2009, Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung reported that after defecting, Asgari told the U.S. about the secret Syrian nuclear reactor, built in partnership with North Korea and with Iranian financing. This was reportedly the first time the U.S. and Israel were alerted of the project. =Ebrahimi story= In late March 2008, Amir Farshad Ebrahimi, an Iranian human rights activist who lives in Germany, was detained at Atat√ºrk International Airport after an Iranian official requested that he be deported to Iran. According to the Iranians, he had played a role in Asgari's defection. In an interview with Newsmax, Ebrahimi explained that he and Asgari had met in the mid-1990s when they worked at Iran's embassy in Beirut. When Asgari was on his trip in Syria in 2007, he called Ebrahimi in Germany to say that his special passport only had two days remaining and that he did not wish to go back to Iran; following Ebrahimi's advice, he rented a car, left his wife in Damascus to drive to Turkey, and paid US$1500 to a Turkish border guard to enter without a visa. Contacts of Ebrahimi's were said to meet him in rooms reserved at the Gilan hotel, but the meeting did not take place because of a police presence outside the hotel. Asgari later reportedly communicated with Ebrahim from Washington, D.C. and Texas. =2009 Iranian reports= On November 15, 2009, several Iranian websites reported details of a two-year Iranian investigation into the matter, which concluded that Asgari was kidnapped by the Israeli, British, and German intelligence agencies, and was currently being held in an Israeli jail.

Early actions Du Chayla was born in Marvejols in the Loz√®re department in southeast France. As a young naval officer, he distinguished himself during the American Revolutionary War, serving under Admiral d'Estaing. He was captured in 1778, and released two years later. He served under Admiral de Grasse aboard the Languedoc and took part in the Battle of Martinique. Du Chayla also fought at the Battle of the Chesapeake and at the Battle of St. Kitts, and was wounded at the Battle of the Saintes. After the war, Du Chayla was promoted to Lieutenant de vaisseau, and later to capitaine de vaisseau, obtaining command of the Tonnant. During the French Revolutionary Wars, he took part in the campaigns on the Italian coasts. In 1793, he was relieved from command because of his nobility, but was soon reinstated. He served as aide to the Minister of the Navy from 1795 to 1797, before being promoted to division commander in 1796, and to contre- amiral soon later. Battle of the Nile, and aftermath In 1798, as a rear admiral, Chayla hoisted his flag aboard the Franklin as second in command of the fleet under Admiral Fran√ßois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers during the campaign in Egypt. Chayla fought gallantly during the battle and tried in vain to persuade Brueys to order the fleet to set sail. He was severely wounded in the French defeat, and he and the Franklin were both captured by the Royal Navy. After his return to France, Chayla was a fierce critic of the tactics of Villeneuve, Decr√®s and Ganteaume, and resigned in 1803. He was later rehabilitated by Napol√©on.

Prior to July 1, 2011, the channel was not Internet-exclusive; it had its own XM satellite radio bandwidth in addition to the online channel. It is devoted to film scores, and originally also featured source music and dialogue from movie soundtracks. Dave Ziemer was the channel's founder, and its programming director from February 2001 to February 14, 2013, when he was laid off. Chris Panico served as Cinemagic's music director from November 2004 to November 2008, at which point he was laid off. Paul Bachmann is the channel's current host, though Cinemagic is mostly automated now due to its Internet-only status. Programming summary Sirius XM once described the channel as follows: > Cinemagic captures the movie experience via score music, soundtracks and > film clips. It's also a destination for movie news and information, plus > interviews with stars and directors. The current channel description reads: > Relive exciting, dramatic, comedic and romantic movie moments through the > magic of movie music. The channel's original mission statement, as drafted by Dave Ziemer, was to build the world's largest library of scores and soundtracks, and to create shows detailing behind-the-scenes information of various films. According to Ziemer, \\"We had a slogan in the early days of XM called AFDI (Actually F****** Doing It), which meant if you had a great idea go ahead and make it happen no matter what. Don't be afraid because it doesn't fall within the realm of normal radio, just make it happen. That was something I strived for and I hope I was able to achieve it . . . with Cinemagic.\\" At one point, the managers of Cinemagic had a library exceeding 30,000 film audio clips and 20,000 songs to be utilized within the channel. However, after the 2008 merger of XM and Sirius, disputes over legality caused the integrated clips to be dropped from the lineup. Under Dave Ziemer's management, Cinemagic produced weekly features highlighting movie news, Blu-ray reviews, and theatrical film reviews. In addition, Ziemer developed and maintained relationships with film studios, publicists, and recording industry professionals. As a result, Cinemagic often played tracks from new film scores, sometimes before they were officially released. The relationships Ziemer maintained also opened the door for the Reel Time interviews of major filmmakers. All of the channel's playlists were created, maintained, evaluated, and scheduled through the Powergold scheduling system. Ziemer would often personally respond to emails and song requests when on-the-air. Additionally, the channel maintained seasonal playlists for holidays. Halloween was a particular favorite of the Cinemagic staff. It was celebrated via the Annual Halloween Horror Festival, first held in 2004, and Big Scare, an uninterrupted horror movie soundtrack marathon taking place on Halloween night (also started in 2004). Starting in 2009, the channel's Halloween festivities also included Cinemagic's Halloween Horror Score Chopdown, a countdown of the scariest horror scores of all time (chosen by composers and filmmakers who were fans of the channel, as well as SiriusXM subscribers and the channel's fans at the xmfan.com website). Occasionally, Ziemer's Cinemagic also ran special events (separate from its Thematic Friday programming). At one point, the channel hosted an 8-hour continuous marathon of Hans Zimmer tracks and scores. In 2009, Cinemagic ran a week-long tribute in honor of the late Jerry Goldsmith's 80th birthday. On Wednesday, June 29, 2011, the station ran five uninterrupted hours of Bernard Herrmann music in honor of his 100th birthday. On Friday, February 15, 2013, Cinemagic belatedly celebrated John Williams' 81st birthday by playing 16 straight hours of his music. Under the current format, the Halloween specials, source music, movie news, reviews, and interviews have been dropped from the programming. However, the station still broadcasts a variety of film scores, including those of Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Chinatown, The Incredibles, Gone with the Wind, Kill Bill Vol. 1&2, Moulin Rouge, Back to the Future, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Air Force One. History Prior to XM going on the air (and even before its first satellite was launched), Dave Ziemer, one of the original XM program directors, was asked to design, develop, and run a channel strictly pertaining to movies. Though Ziemer had not created a channel before, Ziemer's boss at the time gave him free rein to do as he wished with the channel's programming. Thus, Cinemagic was created in 2001 as part of the original XM channel lineup. XM Radio Canada added the channel on April 1, 2007. After a brief stint on Sirius Canada's satellite radio service in 2009, the company relegated Cinemagic to an online channel designated SIR-9. However, in September 2009, in the midst of the Toronto International Film Festival, Sirius Canada abruptly removed Cinemagic from the overall lineup. Initially, the Sirius Call Center was not made aware of the channel's removal. According to the ratings data company Arbitron, Cinemagic's spring 2007 ratings in the US showed an AQH of 800 and a cumulative number of 50,600 listeners. Prior to November 12, 2008, Cinemagic was broadcast in the United States on XM channel 27. From November 12, 2008 through January 1, 2009, Cinemagic was put on hiatus. During this time, Christmas music was broadcast on channel 27. On January 2, 2009, Cinemagic began broadcasting again from its new home on XM channel 76. In addition, due to the XM and Sirius merger earlier in 2008, Cinemagic was broadcast on Sirius channel 81 (Dish Network 6081) starting on January 2. However, at 6 pm Eastern Time on January 5, 2009, after only four days of operation, Cinemagic was no longer available on channel 81. No expiration warning was distributed by Sirius prior to the cancellation. It was replaced on January 15 with The Strobe, a disco-themed channel that apparently returned due to subscriber demand. Nonetheless, due to a technological glitch, channel 81 still played Cinemagic for a short time afterwards. Cinemagic was also on DirecTV channel 822 until all Sirius XM programming was dropped in favor of Sonic Tap on February 9, 2010. On May 4, 2011, Cinemagic was moved to XM channel 73 and Sirius Internet radio channel 806. On June 24, 2011, SiriusXM announced that Cinemagic would be removed from the XM channel lineup on July 1. Going forward, Cinemagic would be exclusively available online via channel 806, for an extra subscription fee. When emailed about the decision, Jeremy Coleman, senior vice president of programming at SiriusXM, responded in a form reply: \\"Every now and then, we have to pull a channel off our service. Our system and bandwidth only allow for so many channels.... Any change we make, even if it allows us to add something new that pleases a large number of people and expand our subscriber base, will upset those that loved the channel we are removing and that‚Äôs certainly the case for Cinemagic....\\" In contrast, Dave Ziemer posted on Cinemagic's Facebook page: \\"Ok everyone, here's the situation. Long story sort of short: As part of the merger agreement, SiriusXM is supposed to carry a certain number of minority owned channels. The FCC approved the channels and the company is slowly instituting them. Bandwidth is an issue and certain channels needed to be dropped to make room for them and unfortunately Cinemagic was one such channel.\\" The final selection aired on Cinemagic's XM satellite radio station leading up to midnight of July 1, 2011, was \\"So Long, Farewell (Auf Weidersehen, Goodbye)\\" from The Sound of Music. The song was cut off abruptly during this final broadcast. The bandwidth was then transferred over to BYU Radio, a Mormon interest group, on channel 143. Currently, in both the US and Canada, Cinemagic is on SiriusXM Internet-only channel 750. Former programs * Reel Time -- A program of hour-long interviews, each focusing on a featured movie. Interview subjects included directors, actors, cinematographers, and others in the film industry. The interviews entailed questions about the featured movie's plot, characters, acting, visuals, camera work, entertainment value, unique elements, and its score. The show was hosted by program director Dave Ziemer, and sometimes co-hosted by music director Chris Panico during his tenure with the channel. \\"Mark Says Hi,\\" aka Mark Seman, occasionally co-hosted after Panico was laid off. Before the move to Internet-only channel 806, Reel Time re-runs would be played at various times throughout the week. On July 7, 2011, Reel Time was relocated to channel 104, \\"SiriusXM Stars Too,\\" and could be heard on Thursdays from 6:00pm‚Äì7:00pm ET, Fridays from 9:00pm‚Äì10:00pm ET, and Saturdays/Sundays from 1:00pm‚Äì2:00pm ET. However, channel 104 has since been discontinued, and the program is defunct. * On the Score -- A program involving interviews with film composers, often covering the interviewee's entire career. The program was hosted by Daniel Schweiger. After Cinemagic's move to channel 806, On the Score was dropped from the programming lineup. It eventually found a new producer in Film Music Magazine. Daniel Schweiger remains as the show's host, and it is sponsored by La-La Land Records. * PopFlix -- A program that played source music from movies such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Zodiac, and Spider-Man 3. * Thematic Friday -- A program aired on Fridays featuring themed playlists. These themes ranged from film franchises (such as Harry Potter), to hours of programming dedicated to a single composer.

History The Unitarian Church The village is home to the D√¢rjiu fortified church, a 13th-century fortified Unitarian Church, which is on UNESCO's World Heritage List. Unitariansm was an official religion in Transylvania from the 1583 Medgyes parliament. The first bishop was Ferenc D√°vid, a local Hungarian-speaking Saxon. The first appointed ruler of Transylvania was the Unitarian John II Sigismund Z√°polya,Queen Isabella and King John son of the Hungarian king John Z√°polya (1526-1541). The villages were historically part of the Sz√©kely Land region of Transylvania province. They belonged to Udvarhelysz√©k district until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when they fell within the Udvarhely County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, they became part of Romania and fell within Odorhei County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.  Heartland of Unitarianism  Between 80,000 and 100,000 Unitarians live in the geographical region of Transylvania, mostly between Sighi≈üoara and Odorheiu Secuiesc, more or less around D√¢rjiu. Further east, Hungarians are Roman Catholics with Calvinist enclaves e.g. in the former H√°romsz√©k County while the former Cs√≠k County is solidly Roman Catholic. The murals of the Unitarian church show the legend of Ladislaus I of Hungary. When the Cumans broke into Kingdom of Hungary, Ladislaus, still a Duke, along with his cousin (King Salamon I) rode against them and freed a girl believed to be daughter of an aristocrat from a Cuman. Unhappily enough, the girl did not support this act of the future Saint. Further murals in the region are to be found at Unitarian churches in Mugeni, CrƒÉciunel (Kar√°csonyfalva) and smaller ones in RugƒÉne≈üti (Rugonfalva) and Cristuru Secuiesc (Sz√©kelykereszt√∫r). Saxon murals are most significant in MƒÉl√¢ncrav (Sz√°szszentl√°szl√≥).

In 1998, a 4th grade teacher from the school with 31 years of experience was interviewed by the New York Times and explained why the state mandated English Language Arts test was not suitable for the grade level. In 1999, the school was one of the top 25 schools in New York State for Percentage of 6th graders scoring at highest level in reading test. In 2000 the school was involved in a controversy when an 11-year-old student was suspended in a nationally reported incident over alleged sexual harassment of a girl. The child's parents claimed that it was an over reaction by the school. However, due to federal privacy regulations, the school could not respond publicly regarding details of the incident. In the face of a threatened lawsuit and media pressure, the school was forced to back down. Many other parents sided with the school, saying there had been many incidents with the child and that the cited incident was simply the straw that broke the camel's back. The overall perception was that the child's parents used lawyers and the media to manipulate the situation to their advantage.

He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He is noted for a series of large scale spectacular stunts done for television. Gunnarson has appeared on television in over 165 countries around the world performing his escapes. Gunnarson has performed over 500 shows across China and his TV escapes have been seen by millions of people there. In 2012 the Chinese Government presented him with \\"The World's Top Escape Artist\\" award after a successful escape on live TV. He has also performed across Canada and the US on TV, fairs, shopping malls, sporting events, and for many of the countries top corporations. In 2016 Dean Gunnarson has a 12 episode X 30 minute TV series entitled Escape or Die that airs Nationally in Canada on OLN network and CITYTV. The series was also sold to numerous countries around the world. The series follows Dean and his team as he travels around the world attempting daring escapes. Escape Or Die! won Best Documentary TV series in Canada. Gunnarson's most notable television appearances include the NBC TV specials The World's Most Dangerous Magic I & II, for which he escaped from a straitjacket while hanging upside down 726 feet above the ground from a trapeze suspended from the Hoover Dam. He has also appeared in the NBC TV special, Magic in The Magic Kingdom, filmed at Disneyland in 1988, and in The Spectacular World of Guinness Records, hosted by David Frost where Dean set two world records for escaping. One of his most recent television specials, \\"World's Most Dangerous Magic II\\" on NBC, Gunnarson faced his greatest fear as he escaped suspended upside down over a swamp of 130 hungry alligators in the Florida Everglades covered in chicken meat and blood. Gunnarson narrowly escaped death in October 1983 during a stunt in which he was handcuffed and chained and nailed into a coffin which was then submerged into the Red River in Winnipeg. The stunt went wrong as the coffin was lowered into the water, leaving him unable to escape. He was eventually pulled from the river and freed by the support crew, at which point he was not breathing and had to be resuscitated by paramedics. The incident led Johnny Carson to refer to Gunnarson on The Tonight Show as \\"that crazy Canadian\\". Some of Dean's other television appearances include The Nashville Network's popular \\"Statler Brothers Show\\", the Disney Channel and Family Channel, where he is a favourite family entertainer. He also has appeared on many shows on Discovery Channel, TLC, Travel Channel and even on Food Network. One of Dean's personal career highlights was opening for Aerosmith at their CD Release Party of \\"Nine Lives\\" in New York City. In February 2013 Ripley's Believe It or Not presented him with the Ripley's record \\"World's Most Daring Escape Artist\\" while in New York for the Anderson Cooper Live TV show with Anderson Cooper and co-host Stacey London. Gunnarson performed a difficult escape on the TV show. He has also been featured in many Ripley's books including a two-page colour spread in \\"Ripley's-The Remarkable Revealed\\" pages 130‚Äì131, where he was buried alive in 2 1/2 tons of wet cement and escaped. In 2012 Gunnarson won the Merlin Award for \\"World's Best Escape Artist\\". Presented in Shenzhen, China by The International Society of Magicians, the world's largest magic organization with over 37,000 members. Founded in 1968 it was the first time ever that they have given the award to an escape artist. Past winners are David Copperfield, Doug Henning, Penn & Teller, and Criss Angel. Gunnarson is widely considered the Greatest living escape artist in the world today because of his legendary escapes performed around the world over such a long career. Gunnarson was also the first recipient and only escape artist to ever win the \\"Houdini Award\\" presented on the Magic Stars television show in Tokyo, Japan. He became the youngest person and first Canadian to be awarded the U.C.T. \\"Humanitarian of the Year\\" for his devotion to raising money for various charities after being chosen out of 185,000 people nominated in North America.

Pliny tells it was some 20 km from Rhegium (modern Reggio di Calabria).

Passage planning or voyage planning is a procedure to develop a complete description of a vessel's voyage from start to finish. The plan includes leaving the dock and harbor area, the en route portion of a voyage, approaching the destination, and mooring, the industry term for this is 'berth to berth'. According to international law, a vessel's captain is legally responsible for passage planning, The duty of passage planning is usually delegated to the ship's navigation officer, typically the second officer on merchant ships. Studies show that human error is a factor in 80 percent of navigational accidents and that in many cases the human making the error had access to information that could have prevented the accident. The practice of voyage planning has evolved from penciling lines on nautical charts to a process of risk management. Planning stages Monitoring progress and comparing it to the plan are key to passage planning. Passage planning consists of four stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring. These stages are specified in International Maritime Organization Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines For Voyage Planning,International Maritime Organization, Section 1 of Guidelines for Voyage Planning, 1999. which are, in turn, reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries.For example, in Title 33 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations The Guidelines specify fifty elements of passage planning, some of which are only applicable in certain situations. The Guidelines specify three key items to consider in the practice of voyage planning: *having and using a voyage plan is \\"of essential importance for safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment,\\" * voyage planning is necessary for all types of vessels on all types of voyages, and * the plan's scope should be based on all information available, should be \\"berth to berth,\\" including when under pilotage, and the plan includes the execution and the monitoring of progress. Voyage planning starts with the appraisal stage. Before each voyage begins, the navigator should develop a detailed mental model of how the entire voyage will proceed.Bowditch 2002, p. 367. The appraisal stage consists of gathering and contemplating all information relevant to the voyage. Much of this appraisal is done by consulting nautical charts, nautical publications and performing a number of technical tasks such as weather forecasting, prediction of tides and currents, and checks of local regulations and warnings.International Maritime Organization, Section 2 of Guidelines for Voyage Planning, 1999. Nautical publications are a valuable guide to local conditions and regulations, but they must be updated and actually read to be of any use. These publications could include Sailing Directions and Coast Pilots or similar texts produced by other authorities. The next stage of the process is known as the planning stage. Once information is gathered and considered, the navigator can begin the process of actually laying out the voyage. The process involves projecting various future events including landfalls, narrow passages, and course changes expected during the voyage. This mental model becomes the standard by which the navigator measures progress toward the goal of a safe and efficient voyage, and it is manifested in a passage plan. A good passage plan will include a track line laid out upon the best-scale charts available.Bowditch 2002, p.214. This track is judged with respect to at least nine separate criteria given in the Guidelines including under-keel clearance, safe speed, air draft, the use of routing and reporting services (TSS and VTS), and the availability of contingencies in case of emergency.International Maritime Organization, Section 3 of Guidelines for Voyage Planning, 1999. electronic systems The navigator will draw and redraw the track line until it is safe, efficient, and in line with all applicable laws and regulations. When the track is finished, it is becoming common practice to also enter it into electronic navigation tools such as an Electronic Chart Display and Information System, a chartplotter, an ARPA system, or a GPS unit.Bowditch 2002, pp 224‚Äì225. When working in a team environment, the passage plan should be communicated to the navigation team in a pre-voyage conference in order to ensure that all members of the team share the same mental model of the entire trip. The third stage of passage planning is the execution stage. The IMO was careful to include execution as part of the process of passage planning. This underscores the fact that the Guidelines list a number of tasks that are to executed during the course of the voyage. It also reiterates the captain's responsibility to treat the plan as a \\"living document\\" and to review or change it in case of any special circumstances that should arise.International Maritime Organization, Section 4 of Guidelines for Voyage Planning, 1999. The fourth and final stage of voyage planning is the monitoring stage. Once the voyage has begun the progress of the vessel along its planned route must be monitored. This requires that the ship's position be determined, using standard methods including dead reckoning, celestial navigation, pilotage, and electronic navigation. According to the Guidelines, the passage plan should always be available to the officer on watch on the bridge. The Guidelines also specify that deviations from the plan should be clearly recorded and be consistent with other provisions of the Guidelines.International Maritime Organization, Section 5 of Guidelines for Voyage Planning, 1999. Computer aids In modern times, computer software can greatly simplify the passage planning process and ensure that nothing important is overlooked. Passage planning software may include functions such as waypoint management, distance calculators, tide and tidal current predictors, celestial navigational calculators, consumables estimators for fuel, oil, water, and stores, and other useful applications.

Technology and the Future of Work is a book written by Barry Jones, originally published in 1982 and reprinted many times. A revised and updated edition was published in 1995. Based on the premise that technologically advanced nations are currently passing through a post- industrial or information revolution, Jones analyzes the unique threats and opportunities of the sudden rise in information to the field such as manufacturing, service employment, and basic income. Jones argues that science and technology have changed the quality, length, and direction of life in the past century far more than politics, education, ideology, or religion. Therefore, inventors such as Thomas Edison and Henry Ford have shaped human experience more broadly and enduringly than Lenin and Hitler. Some of the book's key points, such as the claim that technological innovation is a major component of economic growth, are more widely accepted now than in 1982. But, to quote Barry Jones himself, \\"The central thesis was that people were going to be living longer, far longer, but it was possible that they would be working a good deal less.\\"New Dimensions: \\"Future of Work\\", broadcast transcript, 24 July 2002, with George Negus, Australian Broadcasting Corporation Due to the rising issues for the labour force, Jones proposed the need to assist workers in income support and choosing to stay or leave the workforce. However, Jones noted in the 1990 edition that the Labor government did not pursue the idea of basic income when it won office in 1983. Sleepers, Wake! analyzes the major changes in the workforce and presents the possible political programs to assist the society in profiting from the technological advancements. The fourth edition uses 1991 Commonwealth census data as confirmation of his thesis about changes in the labour force. Barry Jones was Australia's Minister for Science in the Hawke government from 1983 to 1990.

(aka Dr. I.Q., the Mental Banker and Doctor I.Q.) is a radio and television quiz program. Remembered as radio's first major quiz show, it popularized the catch phrase \\"I have a lady in the balcony, Doctor.\\" Radio Over decades, the program's sponsors were Mars Candy, the Vick Chemical Company and Embassy Cigarettes. The radio series did not have a set studio. Instead, it traveled from city to city and broadcast from large concert halls and theaters. Thus, the audience was typically composed of residents from the surrounding area. Microphones were positioned throughout the audience. The quizmaster, Dr. I.Q., delivered silver dollars to audience members who correctly answered his fast-paced questions. The series began April 10, 1939, on the Blue Network with singer-announcer Lew Valentine as Dr. I.Q. Later quizmasters in the role of Dr. I.Q. were Jimmy McClain and Stanley Vainrib. The radio version aired until November 29, 1950 on the NBC and ABC networks. Valentine and McClain were also the hosts of Dr. I.Q. Jr., a juvenile version heard on NBC from 1941 to 1949. The basic premise of the game involved assistants who wandered the theater looking for audience members to play the game. When the assistant found someone willing to play, he or she would say, \\"I have a gentleman in the balcony, Doctor!\\" or something similar. The host would then say, depending on the difficulty of the question: \\"Two (more or less) silver dollars and a box of Mars Bars if you can answer this!\\" Then he would pose a general-knowledge question to the contestant. A correct answer would win the stated dollar amount and candy in the first part of the game and $20 in the second part; incorrect answers would result in a $1 consolation prize. All prizes were paid in silver dollars. A home listener was selected each week to play the game via telephone. At some point during the show, a jingle would play, and the contestant would get a chance to spin the \\"Wisdom Wheel,\\" which would contain prize amounts from $1 to $100, each of which corresponded to a question whose difficulty increased with the prize amount. Other features were the \\"Biographical Sketch\\" and the \\"Thought Twister\\". For \\"The Lady in the Balcony\\" a female contestant in the theater balcony was asked a series of five questions. She would be allowed five incorrect answers. If she had any misses still available after five questions, she would return the following week to face five more questions with the remaining misses in play. If she was able to survive four weeks without incorrectly answering five questions, she won a jackpot prize. Television The television version ran on ABC from November 4, 1953, to October 17, 1954, and again from December 15, 1958 to March 23, 1959. The first host was Jay Owen. However, beginning January 18, 1954, McClain began hosting again. Tom Kennedy hosted the 1958-59 version. Art Fleming, later the first host of Jeopardy!, was an assistant during the original run. On January 18, 1954, Hazel Bishop cosmetics became a sponsor of the program. The television version did not tour to various cities. The first run of the television show was broadcast from the Elysee Theater in New York City, while the second run was broadcast from Studio D of the ABC Television Center in Los Angeles. Episode status Only one episode is known to exist of the 1953-54 version, and it is with McClain as host. Four episodes exist with Kennedy (including a probable pilot taped on October 15, 1958) along with a pilot for a television version of Dr. I.Q.

Built for China The Chinese Nationalist government used 10,000,000 Marks to order two Type IIB U-boats in 1937. They also dispatched 80 men to Germany for training in submarine operations. The Japanese government complained about this transaction, so the Chinese took their money back and these two vessels joined the Kriegsmarine after the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. They were U-120 and U-121. Design German Type IIB submarines were enlarged versions of the original Type IIs. U-120 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged.

U-120 was fitted with three torpedo tubes at the bow, five torpedoes or up to twelve Type A torpedo mines, and a anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of twenty five. Service history U-120 was active from 1940 until she was scuttled in 1945. She was one of two Type II U-boats built at the Flender Werke in L√ºbeck. Along with her sister boat , she was originally built for export to China. The advent of World War II and increased training needs, led the German high command to assign U-120 and U-121 to the training command. From 20 April 1940 to 30 June she was part of the U-Bootschulflottille.

She was the first African-American woman to earn a degree in meteorology and was the first female TV meteorologist trained in the field of meteorology in the United States. Early life and education Bacon-Bercey was born and raised in Wichita, Kansas in 1928. Her father was an attorney and her mother a music teacher. Her father died when she was young, and her mother remarried and moved to Florida, leaving her to be raised by an aunt and uncle. She was an only child that enjoyed bike riding, hiking, playing the piano, and participating in Girl Scouts activities. A high school physics teacher is credited for noticing Bacon-Bercey‚Äôs interest in water displacement and buoyancy and encouraging her to pursue a career in meteorology. She first attended a private college close to home with an intent to major in math, but she left Friends University after two years to pursue a degree in meteorology. She then attended and earned her bachelor's degree in 1954 from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which at that time was one of the few schools in the nation to offer a four-year degree in atmospheric science. She faced opposition and discouragement in her pursuit of her meteorology degree, as she stated during a 1977 interview for a Baltimore Sun article, \\"When I chose my major, my adviser, who is still at U.C.L.A., advised me to go into home economics... I got a D in home economics and an A in thermodynamics.‚Äù Bacon-Bercey became the first African American woman to be conferred a meteorology degree from UCLA. She earned a Masters of Public Administration (MPA) from the Journalism School of University of Southern California in 1979. At the age of 59, she earned a teaching credential to be able to serve as a county relief teacher for elementary and high school math and science courses until she was in her 80s, with her last assignments at Westmoor High School in Daly City, California. Career Shortly after graduation, Bacon-Bercey moved to Washington DC for a position as a weather analyst and forecaster with the National Meteorological Center, now known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service. Bacon-Bercey continued her career as an engineer, when she worked for the Sperry Corporation, then worked for a variety of federal organizations including the United States Atomic Energy Commission. She accepted a position as a senior adviser at the Atomic Energy Commission in 1959 because of her interests to better understand the effects of hydrogen and atomic bombs on Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. While in this role, she studied fallout patterns caused by nuclear detonations. In the 1960s, Bacon-Bercey rejoined NOAA in its New York City offices as a radar meteorologist. In 1971, she joined WGR-TV as a news reporter, in which role she covered the Attica Prison riot.The woman who broke meteorological barriers worked in WNY, by Peter Gallivan; at WGRZ; publish April 9, 2019; updated January 3, 2020; retrieved February 1, 2020 In 1972, she became the station's on-air meteorologist after the previous meteorologist was arrested for bank robbery. She quickly became the station's chief meteorologist. Beginning in 1979, Bacon-Bercey spent nearly ten years as the chief administrator for Television Weather Activities at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and worked on a number of other projects. Increasing the participation of African-American women in meteorology and geophysical science was a major focus for Bacon-Bercey. In 1978, she published an analysis of African-American meteorologists in the US. She had won $64,000 as a contestant on The $128,000 Question in 1977, which she used to establish a scholarship fund for young women interested in atmospheric sciences, administered by the American Geophysical Union (AGU). From 1978-1990, 13 women (12 graduate students, 1 undergraduate student) received $400-$500 of scholarship money from AGU's June Bacon-Bercey Scholarship in Atmospheric Sciences for Women. This scholarship is restarting in 2021. Bacon-Bercey served on the AGU's Committee on Women and Minorities in Atmospheric Sciences, and co-founded the American Meteorological Society's Board on Women and Minorities. Warren M. Washington is another founding member of the AWS Board on Women and Minorities. In addition, she served on the board of directors of the National Consortium for Black Professional Development. In 2006, Bacon-Bercey was featured in a book for young people, June Bacon-Bercey: a meteorologist talks about the weather. Honors Bacon-Bercey was the first woman, as well as the first African-American, to be awarded the American Meteorological Society's Seal of Approval for excellence in television weathercasting when she was working at WGR in Buffalo, New York in the 1970s. In 2000, she was honored during a three-day conference at Howard University for her contributions including: helping to establish a meteorology lab at Jackson State University in Mississippi, her endowment of the scholarship, and her work in California's public schools. Bacon-Bercey was also named a Minority Pioneer for Achievement in Atmospheric Sciences by NASA. Personal life Bacon-Bercey was divorced three times to Walker Bacon Jr., John Bercey and George Brewer. She had two daughters, Dawn-Marie and Dail. Bacon-Bercey died under hospice care in Burlingame, California from frontotemporal dementia on July 3, 2019 at the age of 90. Her death was announced six months later.

It is also known as simply \\"Georgetown Fight Song\\". It is actually an amalgamation of three songs, only the oldest of which, 1913's \\"The Touchdown Song\\", contains the lyric \\"here goes old Georgetown\\". Onto a version of this was added \\"Cheer for Victory\\", written in 1915, and \\"The Hoya Song\\", written in 1930, both of which are included in their entirety. The authors of these songs, and of the combined version, are unknown. Although some effort has been taken to change the song, no serious proposal has come forth. Music Georgetown's fight song is rare among U.S. university fight songs for mentioning other colleges by name, generally rivals of Georgetown in the early to mid-20th century. Specifically, it mentions Yale University, Harvard University, Princeton University, College of the Holy Cross, the United States Naval Academy, and Cornell University, and mocks their fight songs. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the Hoyas only played Cornell and Holy Cross regularly in football, and many of these schools no longer used the fight songs that Georgetown's song mocks. By 2015, rowing was the only sport in which Georgetown athletes competed against all colleges named in the fight song. The song lacks references to Big East Conference rivals, such as Villanova. During men's and women's basketball games, the line \\"Straight for a touchdown\\" is typically changed to \\"Straight for a rebound,\\" which allows the rhyme to continue. In some editions, both the football and basketball versions are sung back to back, while others repeat the first two verses. The final verse is usually followed by a call and response of the school cheer, \\"Hoya Saxa.\\" Anyone can start the Georgetown fight song by asking a large group of Hoyas, \\"How long's it been?\\" The group will reply with the fight song. With a properly motivated Hoya crowd, starting and holding the long low base note of \\"It's‚Ä¶\\" will also work. Usage The song is typically performed at athletics events by the Georgetown University Pep Band, but is also used at other large university occasions. Campus music groups such as The Georgetown Chimes use the song regularly in their performances. In 2006, Georgetown students produced a film, Georgetown Forever, which brings to life different elements of the fight song. The fight song has also been parodied by campus groups such as the Georgetown Solidarity Committee. Though freshmen often memorize the lyrics as part their first week's activities, the song is notoriously difficult to learn, and accurate performance of the fight song is required for membership in certain spirit groups, such as Hoya Blue and the Jack Crew.

Initial incident Two police officers, Jim Knight and Sandra Minor, saw the gold sports car speeding on 18th Avenue S, on October 24, 1996. Knight, who was driving, flipped on the police car's emergency lights and stopped the car near the intersection at 16th Street. In court documents, Knight says he told the driver, 18-year-old Tyron Lewis, to turn off the car's engine and show his hands. Instead, Knight says, Lewis bumped him at least six times with the car. Witnesses would later say Lewis' car rolled at the speed of a baby's crawl. Lewis' passenger, Eugene Young, who was not shot, recalled Lewis saying: \\"Please don't shoot, please don't shoot, I ain't even got nothing!\\" Knight told his partner to smash the car's windows with her baton. As she did, Knight says Lewis attempted to turn the car. Knight was knocked onto the gold hood. He fired his Glock semiautomatic pistol three times, hitting Lewis twice in the arm and once in the chest. He died at the scene. Riots During the investigation immediately following this event, a large crowd had gathered and became agitated due to the police department not sharing information and a number of witnesses describing events. The situation quickly got out of hand and the crowd began throwing rocks, bottles, and other items at police officers. Police officers received reinforcements from other local agencies and off-duty St. Petersburg Police officers. As officers and Sheriff deputies shot tear gas into the crowd and dispersed the initial crowd at 16th Street and 18th Avenue South, a number of individuals continued rioting through the area of St. Petersburg known as Midtown. 705th Military Police Company, Florida National Guard was activated and arrived at the riots to assist local police officers. At least 20 people were arrested and 28 arson fires were confirmed as groups of youths ran back and forth throughout the night, throwing rocks, bricks and bottles at officers in riot gear, businesses and passing cars. At least 11 people were injured, including a police officer who was shot and a newspaper photographer who was beaten, as hundreds of people swarmed through the streets after the shooting on October 24. Stores were looted and thick smoke clouded the neighborhood just south of downtown. In total, the rioters were responsible for an approximate $5 million in property damage. =Different media versions= Media outlets published different versions of the initial incident. The media outlets in and around the St. Petersburg area included the information that the car Lewis was driving was suspected of being stolen. Media outlets outside the area only mentioned that Lewis was pulled over for speeding. The car was actually reported stolen but, after further investigation, was found to be sold to Lewis for an undetermined amount of crack cocaine, then reported stolen by the seller. Aftermath After the rioting, Officer James Knight and his partner Sandra Minor were put on paid leave while investigation into their actions took place. Within a few weeks, the two officers were cleared of all charges by a grand jury, igniting further rioting on November 13 and 14. The Grand Jury had decided that Officer Knight shooting Lewis was reasonable and it was not racially motivated, and this led to further riots. Not even a few hours after the Grandy Jury's ruling, the riots worsened and over 30 fires were started, two police officers and two firefighters were injured (one of them a police helicopter pilot who was hit by gunfire), and dozens were arrested. =Gymnasium naming= The People's Democratic Uhuru Movement has a gym named \\"Uhuru Black Gym of Our Own.\\" City leaders moved the gym to an abandoned building on 9th St. S., renovated the building and renamed it to \\"All People's TyRon Lewis Community Gym.\\" This move sparked controversy with many police officers.  In popular culture  In 2009, Chris Fuller's independent movie Loren Cass was released in the United States depicting the riots.

Life and works  Beck was the son of a pastor. His stay in Paris between 1924 and 1933 proved crucial to his artistic development, where he studied with Jacques Ibert and also made contact with Arthur Honegger, Nadia Boulanger, and Albert Roussel. Returning to Basel in 1933, he headed the music department of Radio Basel for the next thirty years. He helped mediate cultural exchange through his many contacts with Swiss and international musicians. At the suggestion of Swiss conductor Paul Sacher (1906‚Äì1999), who promoted his career more than any other composer, Beck settled in Basel in 1934. During a period of over 50 years, Sacher commissioned his works and conducted their premieres with the chamber orchestra Basler Kammerorchester and the Collegium Musicum Z√ºrich. From 1939 to 1966 Beck worked as music director of Swiss Radio in Basel, a position that enabled him to do a great deal to promote contemporary music. On the occasion of Paul Sacher's 70th birthday, Beck was asked, together with 11 composer friends (Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Wolfgang Fortner, Alberto Ginastera, Cristobal Halffter, Hans Werner Henze, Heinz Holliger, Klaus Huber and Witold Lutos≈Çawski), by Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich to write a composition for cello which used the notes creating Sacher's name: eS, A, C, H, E, Re (E, A, C, B, E, D). Beck created a three-movement work entitled F√ºr Paul Sacher, Drei Epigramme for cello solo. The compositions were partially presented in Z√ºrich on 2 May 1976. His honours include the composition prize of the Schweizerischer Tonk√ºnstlerverein (1954), the Ludwig Spohr Prize of the city of Brunswick (1956) and the Basle Arts Prize (1964). Beck's music is characterized by a large measure of seriousness, tenacity, and depth of expression, but also by transparency and a sense of harmonic proportion. He composed a number of orchestral and choral works in the style of Arthur Honegger, the best known of which was Der Tod zu Basel, a piece for choir, soloists, speaker, and orchestra. Besides opera, his work extended to all kinds of instrumental and vocal music, including seven symphonies, seven concertos, chamber music, one oratorio, one lyric cantata, one elegy, and one ballet, Der gro√üe B√§r.  Biography  =Early years= The son of pastor Bernhard Beck and British architect‚Äôs daughter Lydia Barker, Conrad Beck was born in Schaffhausen and raised in Zurich. After his Matura, he first studied at Zurich‚Äôs Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule. Following private piano lessons from Carl Baldegger and harmony lessons from Paul M√ºller-Z√ºrich, he decided on a musical career. He studied at the Zurich Conservatory with Volkmar Andreae (composition), Reinhold Laquai (counterpoint) and Carl Baldegger (piano). =Stay in Paris= In 1924 he moved to Paris, where he studied instrumentation privately with Jacques Ibert, along with further instruction from Basel composer Ernst Levy. He also sought advice from Nadia Boulanger, Arthur Honegger and Albert Roussel. Soon he could be counted among Boulangers inner circle of friends. The early encouragement he received and the lifelong friendships dating back to his time in Paris would play an important role in his life. The Winterthur patron Werner Reinhart provided additional impetus. From 1927 on, his works were published by Schott in Mainz. When in 1933 the national socialists took power and ‚Äúaryanized‚Äù the cultural scene, this contract was terminated after Beck refused to sign a statement supporting an ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù view of art. It was only after 1945 that Schott once again became Beck‚Äôs publisher. =Move to Basel= Beck relocated to Basel in 1933 at the suggestion of the conductor and music patron Paul Sacher, to whom he had introduced his friend Bohuslav Martin≈Ø. For five decades, Paul Sacher championed Beck, commissioning and conducting premieres of his works with the Basler Kammerorchester and the Collegium Musicum Z√ºrich. From 1936 to 1966 he was music director of Radio Basel. Both here and on the board of the local branch of the IGNM (International Society for Contemporary Music) he was committed to promoting contemporary music. He saw it as an opportunity to encourage young composers even as their music and aesthetics were very different of that of his generation. Since 1963 Conrad Beck lived alternately in Rosey (Franche-Comt√©) and Basel. =Activities as juror and expert= Upon retirement, Beck was frequently called upon as juror and expert. From 1960 to 1980, as Conseiller to the Fondation Prince Pierre he sat on the jury of the Monaco composition competition. He also appeared in this function at the Concours Niccol√≤ Paganini in Genua (1973) and at musical competitions in Oslo, Stockholm and Zurich. =Honours= In 1954 Conrad Beck was awarded the composition prize of the Schweizerischer Tonk√ºnstlerverein, and in 1956 the Ludwig Spohr prize of the city of Braunschweig. He received the Basle Arts Prize in 1964. In 1973, Beck was appointed Commandeur de l‚Äòordre du M√©rite Culturel by Prince Rainier III of Monaco. =Special services to contemporary music= Beck proposed and arranged numerous original and first performances in the Basel local branch of the IGNM, including among others the premi√®re of the last work by Albert Roussel, the string trio op.58 (1937) composed especially for a Basel Jubilee concert the year he died. Shortly before this, Beck had organized the Swiss premi√®re of Roussel‚Äôs ‚ÄúPsalm 80‚Äù in Zurich, and introduced the French composer to Werner Reinhart, Othmar Schoeck and other Swiss musicians. Conrad Beck‚Äôs musical estate is held in the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basel.  Beck's music  From early on, one notes an anti- romantic position in his extensive and varied output, which includes all important genres except opera. This is reflected to the very end in a clear and linear style. Polyphonic structures are central to Beck's music. Voices that strive towards or away from each other are particularly typical of his subtle counterpoint. His dissonance-rich harmonies result predominantly from the respective part-writing. A harsh sonority dominates many works which venture into atonal regions, their themes often derived from complex chords. Owing to his close links to the French music of the Paris group Les Six and the work of his friends in L'√âcole de Paris, Beck's music is often vividly rhythmical. This is instrumental in lightening his inborn Alemannic gravity and an introspection which often comes to the fore in slow movements.  Position in musical history  Although neo-baroque and neo-classical elements alternate in his output, Conrad Beck does not fit into either of these movements. Based on music created during the 1920s in Paris by Stravinsky, Honegger, Roussel, Milhaud and other French composers, Beck developed an independent, predominantly lyrical and deeply expressive style. During the 1930s Beck, with his composer friends Tibor Hars√°nyi (Hungary), Bohuslav Martin≈Ø (Czechoslovakia), Marcel Mihalovici (Rumania), Alexandre Tansman (Poland) and Alexander Tcherepnin (Russia), formed L'√âcole de Paris, whose concerts occasionally also featured Alexander Spitzm√ºller-Harmersbach (Austria). The 1928 premi√®re in Boston of the Third Symphony, conducted by Serge Koussevitsky, was followed by further important performances of Beck's works under Ernest Ansermet, Ernest Bour, Hans M√ºnch, Hans Rosbaud, Hermann Scherchen and Walter Straram, among others.

The school has been judged \\"good\\" with \\"outstanding\\" in the behaviour and safety of pupils, by Ofsted in February 2014. There are currently 1085 students on roll. The current headteacher, Mr S Mitchell, is the sixth headteacher of Parklands. He was appointed headteacher in 2017, when the previous headteacher, Mrs. Claire Hollister, retired from the school. History =Grammar school= The current Parklands High School was originally called Chorley Grammar School. It was originally housed in buildings in Union Street, Chorley which is now home to the public library. It changed its name in 1972, when the school changed from a grammar school to a comprehensive school, to Parklands High School. From 2003 to 2012, Parklands High School held a specialist language college status. Since 1962, the school badge reads Propositi Tenax, which translates to Firm of Purpose. The current motto of the school is Learn, Respect, Aspire, Achieve, which has been used since the school became an academy. =Buildings= The current school buildings were opened in 1959. This included the hall, concourse, south and north blocks and the gym. Several buildings have been erected since the school was first built. This includes the west block, which was built in 1970s, and is currently used as history, music and ICT classrooms. The first major building work was the extension of the north block, which added four more English classrooms and two photography rooms, which are currently named as N01, N02, N14, N15, N24 and N25. This addition was constructed when Mr. Ray Landless was the headteacher of the school. The Science Blocks (L1/L2) were constructed in 1989. There were two major building additions in the 2000s, a new art, RE, drama, and science block which replaced the previous block ROSLA, which was demolished, a new sports hall, and in 2010, an extension to the front of the building, to extend the dining area and reception. In addition students created a new outdoor social area. Parklands was first made a Language College in 2003. In 2014, the Parklands Pavilion was opened after months of refurbishment. This building is currently used as dance studios, and is also used for assemblies. =Academy= Parklands High School converted to academy status in September 2012, meaning the school is now independent of local authority control. Facilities The school has its own all weather pitched which is used for various PE activities, a drama studio, a sports hall, a gym, and the original hall. These are all available to the public for casual and block bookings.

After the original English book of 1989, a French version, published by UNESCO, followed in 1997, and an Arabic one in Lebanon in 2001. The book contains a collection of 45 Palestinian folk tales drawn from a collection of two hundred tales narrated by women from different areas of historic Palestine (the Galilee, the West Bank, and Gaza). The stories collected were chosen on the basis of their popularity, their aesthetic and narrative qualities, and what they tell about popular Palestinian culture dating back many centuries. The authors spent 30 years collecting the material for the book. The English version of the book is studied as part of literature courses at both University of California at Berkeley and Chicago University, and Kana'nah himself taught the study of the book in the masters programs at Bir Zeit University. Some of the folk tales from Speak, Bird, Speak Again have been used in other collections/books: *Margareth Read MacDonald, Alik Arzoumanian (ill), (2006): Tunjur! Tunjur! Tunjur!

It is situated at the junction of the A157 and A158 roads, and approximately north-west from Horncastle and about north-east from the county town of Lincoln.  History  Wragby is named in the Domesday Book as \\"Waragebi\\", when it consisted of 23 households a mill and a church. The 'Rout Yard', a scheduled monument in the form of two moated islands and associated ditched enclosures, is the remains of a medieval manorial complex. In 1086 there were two manors at Wragby, one in the possession of Erenis of Buron, the other, Waldin the Artificer. The surviving remains possibly represent the Buron manor which held responsibility for a church. The church was dismantled in 1836 when a new church was established closer to the modern village centre. The 18th century brick-built chancel was kept as a cemetery chapel until the 1980s when it too was demolished. The ruins of the older church can be seen from the bottom of the cemetery, and are from the grade II listed church of All Saints' which was built in 1839 by W. A. Nicholson. The ruins of the old church are no longer in evidence, but the local history group has marked out the site of the old church and erected information boards. Some artefacts from the old church can be seen in the present day All Saints' Church. The site of the old church and the associated churchyard have been cleared by members of the Wragby Heritage Group, with financial help from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The site of the old church has been marked out, information boards erected and several damaged tombs and headstones repaired. Work is being carried out in order to map out the position and occupants of the gravesites. Market Place, Wragby Wragby was a market town and staging centre through a charter dating back to Charles II. The market was held on a Thursday, and there was a fair held on 1 May, and 28‚Äì29 September. A grammar school founded in 1635, and rebuilt in 1775 are both now in residential use. There was also a Grade II listed windmill, built in 1831. It was powered by six sails until 1903 when it ceased working. The 1887 OS Map shows a second windmill off Victoria Street however it has gone in the 1906 map. In 1883 the last European wildcat in England was killed at Bullington Wood, near Wragby.Lincolnshire Over time Wragby has evolved to be a stopping point en route to the coastal town of Skegness, with amenities including three public houses, a fish shop, caf√© and a supermarket. The population of Wragby has expanded though the building of two new housing estates; a third estate began development in late 2009, with completion expected by early 2012. Kier Group initially began the new construction projects after buying-out local homebuilder Hugh Bourn. However, Kier then themselves sold the land and properties to Linden Homes (themselves a subsidiary of Galliford Try), who have continued construction of sites in the town, such as Carpenters Lodge. Railway A station was opened in the town on the Louth to Bardney Line. The station was located on Horncastle Road near the present day Station Mews housing estate. The station was to the east of the town. The station opened in 1874 and closed to passengers in 1951. Only to close fully in 1960 to goods traffic. The line has been built over by houses and road alignments. Although the station and platform remain as a private residence. There were also stations in the nearby villages of East Barkwith and Kingsthorpe. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches east with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 2,469.

His youngest son is the actor Hugh Laurie. Early life, education and rowing career Laurie was born in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, in 1915, the son of William Walker Laurie (1882‚Äì1976) and Margaret Grieve (n√©e Mundell) (1886‚Äì1959). He was of Scottish descent. Laurie began his rowing career at Monkton Combe School, and continued rowing when he attended Selwyn College, Cambridge in 1933, where he was a member of the Hermes Club. A. P. McEldowney, the chronicler of Selwyn rowing and founder of University of London Boat Club, said of Laurie: \\"This year (1933) there arrived at Selwyn a Freshman who was not only the most famous oarsman Selwyn ever had, but also one of the most famous Great Britain ever had ‚Äì WGRM Laurie. And we can truly claim him as a Selwyn oarsman. He had always told me he learnt all his rowing from Taffy Jones at Monkton Combe School. And where but Selwyn did Taffy learn his rowing?\\" Laurie rowed for Cambridge in the 1934, 1935, and 1936 boat races, all of which were won by Cambridge. He was in the boat with Jack Wilson, who was to become his rowing partner later in their careers. At the 1936 Olympics, he rowed as stroke in Great Britain's eight, the team eventually finishing in fourth place. Together, Laurie and Wilson, rowing for Leander Club, won the Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta in 1938. After war interrupted their rowing careers, Laurie and Wilson returned to Henley in 1948, once again winning the Silver Goblets. This was followed a month later by a gold medal in the coxless pair event at the 1948 Olympics in London, rowing on their familiar Henley course. It was described by Laurie as \\"the best row we ever had\\". Laurie and Wilson were the best pair of their generation, and it was not until Steve Redgrave and Andy Holmes won the Olympics in 1988 that Britons once more excelled in this class of boat. Laurie and Wilson were known as the \\"Desert Rats\\" because of their sojourn in the Sudan. They were trained at Leander Club by Alexander McCulloch, who won a silver medal at the 1908 Olympics. Their boat is now on show at the River and Rowing Museum at Henley- on-Thames, hanging above the boat that won the 1996 Summer Olympics with Redgrave and Pinsent. Laurie was elected a steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 1951, and also served as a Henley umpire. He sat on Henley's management committee between 1975 and 1986. Colonial and medical career Laurie joined the Sudan Political Service in 1936, becoming District Commissioner of Nyala. In 1954, he qualified as a medical doctor, working for 30 years as a general practitioner in Blackbird Leys, Oxford. He also chaired the Oxford Committee of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award between 1959 and 1969, and the Oxford branch of Save the Children from 1986 to 1989. In 2005, it was proposed that the newly refurbished health centre in Blackbird Leys be named after Laurie in recognition of his service to the local community; however, it was subsequently named The Leys, after the local area, when it opened in February 2006. Personal life Laurie was married to Patricia Laidlaw from 1944 until her death from motor neurone disease in 1989; both were members of their local Presbyterian church, now St Columba's United Reformed Church, Oxford. They had two daughters and two sons, the youngest of whom is the actor Hugh Laurie, who followed in his father's footsteps, rowing for Selwyn College and Cambridge University, and playing a doctor in House. Ran Laurie married Mrs Douglas Ernest Arbuthnot, (Evaline) Mary Arbuthnot, n√©e Morgan in 1990 in Norfolk. Laurie died of Parkinson's disease in 1998 at the age of 83.

It was a rebadged Fiat 508C \\"nuova Balilla\\" made at Fiat's Simca plant in Nanterre, France. High profile launch breaking records  The Simca 8 was first presented, at the Paris Motor Show in October 1937, and sales in France started almost immediately in November. Early the next summer Henri Pigozzi, Simca's energetic boss, organised a three part endurance run under the supervision of the ACF. A single Simca 8 undertook a \\"non-stop\\" 50,000 kilometer (31,075 miles) run split as follows: * 10,000 kilometers (6,215 miles) lapping the Montlh√©ry circuit averaging 115.1 km/h (72 mph) and returning 7.9 l/100 km * 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) on open roads averaging 65 km/h (40 mph) and consuming 6.0 l/100 km * 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) in Paris averaging (impressively) 54 km/h (34 mph) and consuming 6.5 l/100 km The initial 10,000 km round the race-circuit south of Paris involved breaking no fewer than 8 international records, although the manufacturer's advertisement including this information does not spell out what these records were. The purpose of the exercise was, of course, to gain positive publicity for the Simca 8, and as soon as the 50,000 kilometers had been completed, on 12 May 1938, a press dinner was organised at which the journalists were able to dine with the drivers, the ACF monitors, and the Simca directors as well as representatives from Shell and Dunlop, whose products had presumably played a key role in the exercise. The printed summary of the event, used to advertise to the wider public, concluded with an invitation that the reader \\"achetez la m√™me voiture\\" (buy the same car). The engine The '8' in the car's name did not indicate an eight-cylinder engine; it had but four cylinders, and was officially rated as a 6CV vehicle for tax purposes. At launch the car featured a 1,089 cc engine with a claimed output of 32 hp at 4,000 rpm. Fuel feed came via a Solex 30mm carburetor and overhead valves driven, using rods and rocker arms, by a side-mounted camshaft. An unusual feature at the time was the use of aluminium for the cylinder head. Shortly before it was replaced in 1951, the Simca 8 had acquired, in September 1949, the Fiat designed 1,221 cc engine which would also be employed its successor, the popular 7CV Simca 9 Aronde. The body Simca 8 1200 Cabriolet of 1950 At launch only two bodies were offered, these being a 4-door \\"berline\\" (saloon/sedan) and a 2-door cabriolet. This contrasted with the Simca's Italian cousin for which a wider range of bodies was available from the start and it also marked a departure from the strategy followed by Simca themselves with the predecessor model, the Simca-Fiat 6CV which had been offered with almost as wide a range of body variants as its Turin built relative. The 4-door saloon body was unusual in that there was no central pillar between the front doors, hinged at the front, and the rear doors, hinged at the back, permitting particularly easy access when a front and rear door were opened simultaneously. In 1937 the Simca 8 4-door Berline was priced at 23,900 Francs for a \\"Normale\\" version and at 25,900 Francs for a \\"Grande Luxe\\". The Peugeot 202 made its debut only six months later, in Spring 1938, and was priced at 21,300 Francs for a \\"Normale\\" version and at 22,500 Francs for a \\"Luxe\\". The cars were similar in size and power, but sales data suggest that the market found space for both of them, despite the Simca's higher price. The post war range became wider, with coup√©, cabriolet and after 1948 estate versions listed, but these were all substantially more expensive than the berline: virtually all the cars sold were still Simca 8 Berlines, which early in 1947 were priced at 330,000 francs against 420,000 francs for the cabriolet. (The slightly longer but slightly slower competitor from Peugeot, the 202 was priced at 303,600 francs which included a sunroof at no extra cost.) Over the course of a few years the Simca 8 underwent some grille changes, and other minor upgrades. Market reaction Simca 8 4-door saloon The Simca 8 won plaudits for its lively temperament and excellent fuel economy. The four ratios on the new gear box were chosen so that even when cruising at 110 km/h (68 mph) fuel consumption remained reasonable, and set to permit good progress along country roads and reasonable acceleration even in hilly areas. The car also came with unusually precise steering and efficient hydraulically controlled brakes that did not overheat. Commentators nevertheless noted that the engine was noisy when working hard, the (semaphore style) direction indicators were fragile, and the ambitiously sophisticated front suspension also proved fragile when confronted with France's rural roads, many of which were still unpaved. The gear box could be disagreeable when changing down across the gate from third speed to second, and the car was only just large enough for four people, with only a small storage area for luggage, located in a hard to get at position behind the back seat and without any external access. Commercial For most of the time the Simca 8's principal competitors were the \\"bargain basement\\" Renault Juvaquatre and the Peugeot 202. After the war, with the Juvaquatre range restricted to an estate version, and Peugeot moving half a market segment up at the end of 1948 replacing the Peugeot 202 with the larger 203, sales of the Simca 8 held up impressively even though the Simca was itself by now clearly nearing the end of its production run. In 1948 the Simca 8 was Simca's top seller, with approximately 14,000 sold, almost all of them were saloons. Two years later, in its penultimate year, the car was being produced at an even higher rate. The principal complication arose from the fact that the car was in most respects a badge engineered Fiat, which compromised its export potential, which was a particular issue after the war, when government (and the state of the French economy) were demanding heroic export effort from France's leading auto-makers. The French car market in the early 1950s was concentrated, with just three models between them accounting for two thirds of domestic sales in 1950. Nevertheless, as the fourth best selling car of 1950 the Simca 8 with unit sales of 17,705 in that year achieved a respectable 10.2% market share.

After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, they became part of Romania and fell within Odorhei County during the interwar period. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Hungarian Autonomous Province, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Hungarian Autonomous Province. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.

Career Born in Caruaru, J√°ilson spent his youth years at Porto de Caruaru. Afterwards he played for Santa Cruz, Sport, Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es, among others. In 2006, he arrived at Paulista, and had his breakthrough season, scoring 17 goals in the 2006 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B. That performance attracted interest of Corinthians, who signed him in December 2006. However, despite a good start, which included a double against S√£o Bento, in late February, Corinthians opted to loan him to Russian team Rubin Kazan until November. Six months later, Ja√≠lson was in Portugal, signing a four-year contract with Benfica and being immediately loaned to Braga. He was used as a back-up to Roland Linz, coming off the bench on all but three appearances, scoring four goals. After the season ended, his former manager at Braga, Manuel Machado, in transit to Nacional, requested that Benfica loaned him again. Nevertheless, in July 2008, Ja√≠lson returned to Brazil to sign with Coritiba. He spent six months there, moving to Atl√©tico Goianiense in 2009. His time in Goianiense was short and in July 2009, he returned to Portugal to play for Olhanense. Less than a month later, he was released because of physical problems. His next stop was Cyprus, playing for Ermis Aradippou for the remainder of the season. Back to Portugal in 2010, Ja√≠lson was an important player for Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal in 2010‚Äì11, scoring four goals, the last two earned the club six points that helped them escape relegation. He did not renew his contract with Set√∫bal and was without team until January 2012, when he joined Boa. A month later, he terminated his contract with Boa. In March 2012, J√°ilson joined Fortaleza, staying there until September 2013, scoring 23 goals. After Fortaleza, he played three months at Icasa, before moving to Treze, where he played in 2014. Following a two-year spell at Central, J√°ilson returned to Paulista in February 2015, staying there for eleven months, until signing with Sergipe.

Poitier plays a sergeant unexpectedly placed in command of the survivors of a platoon in the Korean War. The film explores the racial integration of the American military, centering on the African-American sergeant's struggle to win the trust and respect of the men in his unit. Plot When a lieutenant is mortally wounded in a winter ambush that decimates his platoon, he passes command to the highest ranking survivor, Sergeant Towler (Sidney Poitier). However, with the exception of African- American Towler, all of the men left alive are white. Towler feels Private Kincaid (Alan Ladd), an ex-sergeant with eleven years experience (demoted for doing things his way), is better suited for command, but the lieutenant orders him to take charge and complete their vital mission: to take and hold a farmhouse strategically positioned in a mountain pass for the advance of their battalion. After the lieutenant dies, Southerner Private Bracken (Paul Richards) initially refuses to take orders from Towler, but Towler forces him, at gunpoint, to back down. With their radio not working, Towler leads ten healthy survivors and a badly wounded Private Casey on a stretcher to their objective. As they warily approach the farmhouse, one soldier spots someone inside and throws a grenade, which wounds a Korean woman. The only other occupants are her young son and her adult, part-French daughter Maya. Kincaid and some of the others want to leave before the enemy attacks, but Towler keeps them there. They repel an attack later that night. Hunter, a Navajo, volunteers to scout the area in place of Towler. They agree on a password. Hunter is captured, but despite being hit repeatedly, refuses to say the password when he is forced toward the outpost manned by Towler and Kincaid. After his challenges are not answered, Towler fires, striking Hunter and some enemy soldiers. After the enemy is repelled, Hunter gives the password. Towler and Kincaid find him; he talks to Towler before dying. Bracken tries to force himself on Maya. Her scream brings Towler, but Bracken ignores Towler's order to leave and strikes him. Towler knocks him down, but Bracken remains defiant. Lazitech, manning the outpost, is the next casualty. At his own request, Casey is carried to a gunport to fight; he dies in the next assault. Towler and Kincaid start brawling when Towler catches Kincaid slacking off afterward, but they break off when they hear a tank approaching. After driving off the accompanying infantrymen with a machine gun, Towler and Kinkaid use kerosene and torches to set the tank on fire. When a tank man opens the hatch, Kinkaid tosses in a grenade. The tank runs over his leg when he jumps off; Corpsman Wade has to amputate it, but the only man who has the right type blood for a transfusion is Towler. The operation is a success, despite Wade's lack of training. When a column of tanks is spotted, Towler sends his men and the civilians up the pass, while he goes back and carries Kinkaid to the outpost. Fortunately, friendly aircraft appear and bombard the enemy infantry as they advance, signalling the approach of the battalion.

Bartlett came up with the original story with Gene Coon and wrote the script himself. He aimed to make the film independently, though the exact start date was going to be dependent on Poitier's success in A Raisin in the Sun. Columbia Pictures agreed to finance on the proviso that Bartlett rewrite the script for a white co-star. Bartlett found the only major star willing to do the movie was Alan Ladd who co-produced the film.pp.180-181 Goudsouzian, Aram Sidney Poitier: Man, Actor and Icon 2004 UNC Press Bartlett: > I could have done it [the film] on a shoestring in some canyon in the > Hollywood Hills, but I felt that now is the time for me to prove myself with > a picture in the million-plus category.

The film features an unusual cast who works well together. In addition to Ladd and Poitier, the cast includes comedian Mort Sahl, who does a comedy routine, James Darren who sings the title song (he was meant to sing three songs in all) and boxer Ingemar Johansson in his American film debut. Bartlett cast his Argentine wife Ana Mar√≠a Lynch/Ana St. Clair as a French Korean, Mario Alcalde as an American Indian, Hollywood born Paul Richards as a bigoted Southerner, and local Blackfoot Indians as North Koreans. \\"I just play myself\\", said Johansson. All the Young Men was filmed in Glacier National Park in Montana and Mount Hood, Oregon.http://www.communitywalk.com/location/glacier_park_all/movies/1189617 Poitier's commitment to make the film meant he had to leave the run of A Raisin in the Sun early. Columbia planned two separate advertising campaigns for the film to white and black audiences.Shared Pleasures: A History of Movie Presentation in the United States, Gormery, Douglas, University of Wisconsin Press, p. 166 Columbia also used Quentin Reynolds to promote the film in advertising campaigns.

The Fulton Ferry was the first steam ferry route connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York City, United States, joining Fulton Street, Manhattan, and Fulton Street, Brooklyn, across the East River. It revolutionized travel between the then City of New York on Manhattan Island and the Village of Brooklyn and the rest of Long Island. Robert Fulton's steam Fulton Ferry Company in 1814 established his name on the ferry service. After the Brooklyn Bridge was built, ridership declined, and the ferry ceased operation on January 19, 1924.Brian Cudahy, Over and Back, p229 NYC Ferry now serves a very similar route. Colonial era The first grant for a commercial ferry was given by Dutch governor Willem Kieft to Cornelis Dircksen in 1642; however, local waterfront land- owners were free to make their own crossings of the river. A ferry connecting Broad Street in what was then New Amsterdam with Joralemon Street in what was then Breukelen was started in the 1630s by lone ferryman Cornelis Dircksen. It was later moved to Maiden Lane and Ferry Road, soon to be called Fulton Street. The ferry played a large role in cementing the Manhattan-Brooklyn rivalry. Two charters ‚Äì the first in 1686, the second in 1708 ‚Äì gave to Manhattan ownership of the lines and essentially all of the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1745, Hendrick Remsen brought a lawsuit against New York; after thirty years, the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, awarding him his original five shillings plus court costs of nearly 2,375 shillings (475 times his original request). The city appealed to the crown, but America's declaration of independence threw the case into legal limbo, allowing the City of New York to retain its claim to the Brooklyn waterfront. The site was known as \\"Brookland Ferry\\" when George Washington escaped with his troops after the Battle of Long Island. After the Revolutionary War, ferrymaster Adolph Waldron gained sole control of the ferry by virtue of being the only Whig with a claim to it. He experimented with barges with little success, although his hold on the ferry was very profitable for him. The City refused to renew his lease in 1789, opting instead for a second major charter in 1795, establishing the Catherine Ferry (or, popularly, the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù Ferry), a stock-based company. Steam ferry service Robert Fulton, at the behest of Brooklyn magnate Hezekiah Pierrepont, secured a 25-year lease on the ferry in 1814. The first trip of the steamboat Nassau was made on May 10, 1814, and brought with it the first predictable passage between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Trips took no longer than twelve minutes, and there was no chance of the ship being swept upstream or downstream, or held to the whims of the wind. Brooklyn Heights became known as \\"America's First Suburb\\" as residents could commute to Manhattan with ease. The shareholders of this line, now called Union Ferry, were mostly based in Manhattan; they tended to favor increased profits over improved service. (The stock paid a generous 7% dividend.) Fares started at four cents, which led to rival services at Red Hook and elsewhere. Union Ferry reduced its fare to one cent in stages between 1842 and 1850, bankrupting the competing lines and allowing Union Ferry to purchase their rights and raise rates once again. On January 24, 1814, the Fulton Ferry Company, founded by Robert Fulton and William Cutting, obtained a lease on the route from the City of New York. The company introduced steamboat service to the route with the Nassau on May 8, 1814 (the first steam ferry service on the East River), and moved the Manhattan landing to Fulton Street that year. The ferry, which had been known popularly as the Old Ferry since 1795, when the Catherine Ferry (New Ferry) was introduced, became known as the Fulton Ferry,Nathaniel Scudder Prime, A History of Long Island: from its first settlement by Europeans, to the year 1845, pages 376 to 380 and the streets on either side were later renamed in turn. The Fulton Ferry Company and the South Ferry Company merged in 1839 to form the New York and Brooklyn Union Ferry Company. The ferry continued to be successful until the 1883 opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. It stayed in service for another 41 years, ceasing operations in 1924. Demand was still sufficient to require the building of the Fulton Street Line (elevated) to the hub, in use from 1888 to 1940. (The eastern end of the line is now used by the IND Eighth Avenue Line.) East River Ferry Ferry service to Manhattan returned in 2006, with New York Water Taxi operating seasonal service. In February 2011, New York Waterway was contracted to operate a route calling at six slips in Brooklyn and Queens as well as the Manhattan East Side terminals. Service, begun in June 2011, operates in both directions with year-round peak service running every 20 minutes. Additional Summer (April-Oct) daily service runs off-peak every 30 minutes. In 2017, this service became part of the NYC Ferry system's East River route.

It is speculated that the move was made due to possible revenge by families of the deceased. He lived in the United States for two decades, returning to Serbia in 2014. Early years Lau≈°eviƒá was born on 19 January 1960, in Cetinje, SR Montenegro, SFR Yugoslavia. He fell in love with theater and acting in his early teens, and got his first TV role at the age of eighteen. In 1982, immediately upon graduating from the University of Belgrade‚Äôs Academy of Theatrical Arts, he was cast in his first lead film role. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he received mostly lead roles in 25 movies, 17 TV shows and numerous theatrical productions all across Yugoslavia. During this period, he became one of Yugoslavia's most popular movie and theatrical actors. Although young, handsome and very charismatic, it was his dramatic skills and range as an actor that propelled him to fame across the former Yugoslavia. Controversy and Tragedy In May 1990, Lau≈°eviƒá accepted the lead role in a politically controversial theater production. The opening night performance at the Yugoslav Drama Theatre in Belgrade was violently disrupted by nationalist extremists. Subsequently, Lau≈°eviƒá started to receive numerous and repeated threats of bodily harm and even death. His car was vandalized around this time. In these violent and turbulent political times where murder or persecution of opponents of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá often went unchecked by the authorities, these threats could not be taken lightly. Lau≈°eviƒá became increasingly concerned for his own personal safety and that of his family. Upon recommendation of the police, he applied for and was granted a license to carry a gun. In the early 1990s, Lau≈°eviƒá's visible opposition to the civil wars in Yugoslavia made him a target of ongoing media attacks in the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. He was often harassed when he went to public places. It was in this charged atmosphere that a tragic event occurred on a hot summer's night in Podgorica (Montenegro). On the evening of July 30, 1993, 33-year-old Lau≈°eviƒá appeared at the premiere performance of a theatre production in the coastal town of Budva. Returning to Podgorica, Lau≈°eviƒá and his brother, Branimir, stopped at a walk-in fast food kiosk called 'Apple' around midnight. The argument broke out between them and the group of locals hooligans, which escalated into a fist fight. Lau≈°eviƒá fired 13 rounds from the CZ-99 gun, which he was licensed for, killing 20-year-old Dragor Pejoviƒá and 21-year-old Radovan Vuƒçiniƒá and also wounding Andrija Kaziƒá. Quoting from the closing statement by the judge in his last trial: ‚Äú≈Ωarko Lau≈°eviƒá was beaten on the ground and had the right to defend himself. In this difficult situation, he managed to pull the gun out of his bag and shoot several bullets at the attackers.‚Äù Two of the assailants were gravely wounded and eventually died; a third was wounded and fled the scene together with three others. Legal Battles What followed was a 16-year legal ordeal. There were four trials, three different courts considered his case nine times, rendering nine decisions. Initially, Lau≈°eviƒá was convicted of double murder and sentenced to a 15-year prison term (his brother was sentenced to 2 years in prison). This sentence was later reduced on appeal to 13 years. Subsequently, the Yugoslav Federal Court threw out the 1996 conviction. Yugoslavia's highest court determined that the Montenegrin courts incorrectly rejected Lau≈°eviƒá's self- defense argument. The 13-year sentence at the retrial was also thrown out on appeal. At the third trial in February 1998, Lau≈°eviƒá received a 4-year sentence. He was immediately set free since his time served in prison (4 years and 7 months) exceeded the sentence. Following another appeal, Montenegro's highest court ordered another retrial. At the fourth trial in October 1999, the 4-year sentence was reconfirmed and Lau≈°eviƒá remained free. Seeking refuge from the blood-feud threats repeatedly made against him since the first trial, Lau≈°eviƒá left Yugoslavia altogether and joined his wife and daughter in the United States. In March 2001, while reaffirming the lower court‚Äôs factual assessment of the case, Montenegro's Supreme Court made an ad hoc change to the verdict by reinstating the 13-year prison sentence. At that time, the Yugoslav federation was disintegrating and Montenegro was boycotting jurisdiction of federal institutions. Montenegro's court system blocked Lau≈°eviƒá from exercising his legal and constitutional right of appeal to the Yugoslav Supreme court. Since 2001, Lau≈°eviƒá has been engaged in an unending struggle for reinstatement of his legal and constitutional right of appeal. There was no longer a Yugoslav court system in which to file an appeal. Montenegro declared independence and now has a separate court system. The Serbian court system has no jurisdiction with respect to Montenegrin matters. Lausevic's Disappearance and Reappearance After his release from prison, Lau≈°eviƒá did not act for years. He appeared in just two more films but his acting career was effectively finished. He did not appear in another film in Yugoslavia after 1999. Although no public threats were made by the deceased's family, Lau≈°eviƒá fled Yugoslavia for the United States. With his departure, he disappeared from the press for the most part, except for sporadic articles which recalled his case and the tragic fall of the popular, young actor. Virtually nothing was known about his life or circumstances in the United States. Lau≈°eviƒá did not pursue acting after leaving Yugoslavia and it is rumored that he took manual labor jobs in the U.S. Eerily, life seems to have imitated art for Lau≈°eviƒá. In 1993, prior to his legal troubles, he had taken a role in the film \\"Bolje od bekstva\\" (translation: Better than Escape) in which his character is involved in a murder and subsequently flees to the United States. In July 2009, Serbian press reported that Lau≈°eviƒá was detained in the United States due to lack of proper immigrant documentation/status and was facing deportation hearings. Based on these limited news reports, it is assumed that when he entered the United States, he never obtained proper visas or documentation to stay and work. Immediately, his old case and the circumstances were discussed once again in the Serbian and Montenegrin media. There was speculation whether he would be deported from the United States to Serbia or to Montenegro. In Montenegro, Lausevic would be subject to the outstanding decision of the Montenegro Supreme Court which reinstated the 13-year prison sentence; this would mean he would face more prison time if returned to Montenegro. Technically, he probably has Montenegrin citizenship‚Äîhe was outside the country when the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was dissolved, and he was unable to transfer his citizenship to Serbia at the time. However, it is not known for sure what citizenship Lau≈°eviƒá has. According to Serbian press reports, his local lawyer raised the issue of Serbian citizenship. If Lau≈°eviƒá has Serbian citizenship, he would be deported to Serbia and by-pass the Montenegrin court system. If returned to Serbia, it would be unlikely that Serbia could extradite a \\"Serbian citizen\\" to Montenegro, as proscribed by Serbian law. In this situation, the Serbian court system might presumably have jurisdiction to review any outstanding issues related to Lau≈°eviƒá and rule on the matter. The Serbian government has provided no indication if it would get involved in this matter. Lau≈°eviƒá has been married twice. His first marriage, which produced a son and a daughter, dissolved after his release from prison. He later married a second time to a woman who worked in film and theatre as well. Lau≈°eviƒá has been living with his wife, his wife's daughter from her first marriage, and their daughter in the United States. Lau≈°eviƒá's case in the United States is still pending. He has hired an American lawyer to fight U.S. deportation proceedings. On December 29, 2011, Serbian president Boris Tadic gave Lau≈°eviƒá amnesty from further charges regarding the 1993 double murder.http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2011&mm;=12‚ÖÜ=29&nav;_category=16&nav;_id=569694 On February 1, 2012, Serbian deputy Prime Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá granted Lau≈°eviƒá Serbian citizenship and passport.http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/201125/Da%C4%8Di%C4%87+uru%C4%8Dio+srpski+paso%C5%A1+Lau%C5%A1evi%C4%87u.html Filmography *Princ Rastko Srpski (2018) (filming) ....

It was conceived in 2003 by Mario Segni, Carlo Scognamiglio Pasini (ex-PLI, ex-PL, ex-FI, ex-UDR, ex-UpR, ex-FdL and ex-DE) and Michele Cossa (leader of the Sardinian Reformers), as a centrist party alternative to the centre-left. The party is aimed at changing Italian political system and especially Italian centre-right, which is perceived by its leaders as populist under the leadership of Silvio Berlusconi. The party is basically the continuation of the late Patto Segni. Segni and Scognamiglio launched PLD in time for contesting the 2004 European Parliament election, in which they hoped to attract many disgruntled centre- right voters. Instead PLD scored only 0.5% (7.4% in Sardinia, where its regional division, the Sardinian Reformers, is aligned with the House of Freedoms). After that the centre-right decided again to rally behind Berlusconi, Segni and Scognamiglio decided not to present their list for the 2006 general election, in which Berlusconi's Forza Italia scored 23.7% and the Sardinian Reformers elected a Senator, Massimo Fantola, in UDC list. Segni and supporters opposed the 2006 Constitutional Referendum. In early 2007 Segni became Coordinator of the Promoting Committee of the Electoral Referendum, led by Giovanni Guzzetta. This would place Segni alongside politicians such as Gianni Alemanno, Angelino Alfano, Mercedes Bresso, Riccardo Illy, Renato Brunetta, Antonio Martino, Giovanna Melandri, Arturo Parisi, Daniele Capezzone, Stefania Prestigiacomo, Gaetano Quagliariello, and Giorgio Tonini in the fight for a majority based electoral system. On July 24 of 2007 Segni handed over 800,000 signatures to the Court of Cassation for the presentation of the Electoral Referendum. The referendum, which took place on 21‚Äì22 June 2009, did not reach the required quorum. After the failure of the referendum, Segni left parliamentary politics.

The area of the district is . Population: Postal codes: 113000 to 119000. The district, adjacent to Presnensky, Arbat, and Khamovniki Districts of Central Administrative Okrug, contains a prestigious strip of land along Kutuzovsky Prospekt, Victory Park, and Kiyevsky Rail Terminal. History This section is based on P.V.Sytin's \\"History of Moscow Streets\\"Russian: –ü.–í.–°—ã—Ç–∏–Ω, \\"–ò–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É–ª–∏—Ü\\", –ú, 1948 Original Dorogomilovo sloboda was located on the opposite (eastern) bank of the Moskva River, between Khamovniki and Novodevichy Monastery. Peasants of this sloboda, personally free, were paying their taxes with Yam (mail coach) service on the old road to Smolensk, the main link between Moscow and Poland. Smolensk was annexed by Moscow in the course of the Russo-Polish War, and as a result the road was straightened and a new river crossing emerged on site of present-day Borodinsky Bridge. Dorogomilovo sloboda relocated to the western bank, to present-day Dorogomilovo. For the next two hundred years, the new and the old settlements shared the same name. The only other settlement on the western bank was a fishing village owned by the Patriarch. In 1731‚Äì1742, when Moscow city boundary expanded to Kamer- Kollezhsky Val limits, Dorogomilovo sloboda was incorporated into Moscow. Gradually, the once-free coach-drivers were stripped of their liberties and reduced to taxpayer peasant status. Former sloboda population decreased from 117 households in 1699 to 24 in 1801. Instead, Dorogomilovo acquired one of Moscow's largest cemeteries (Orthodox, 1771, Jewish, 1788Russian: Official site, history page, 18th century www.dorogomilovo.ru ). In 1812, old Smolensk road witnessed the retreat of Russian troops and Napoleon's conquest of Moscow. The village of Fili, where Kutuzov made his decision to abandon Moscow, is situated just outside the modern Dorogomilovo District boundary. The French marched to Moscow in three columns, crossing the river in Fili, Dorogomilovo, and Luzhniki. Meanwhile, wounded at Battle of Borodino were dying and buried at Dorogomilovo cemeteries.Russian: Official site, history page, 1812 www.dorogomilovo.ru Industrial development of the 19th century was slow, due to the regular floods. The main employers in the area was a brewery set on a hill in 1875, still operating as Badayev Brewery (19th century postcard), a dye factory (1883), and a cement plant (1894). Newspapers, describing 1879 flood, wrote that \\"brewery workers managed to roll out a beer barrel and floated away from the site\\"...Russian: \\"–†–∞–±–æ—á–∏–µ –ø–∏–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥–∞ —É—Ö–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –¥–ª—è —ç—Ç–æ–π —Ü–µ–ª–∏ —É–ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–∏—Ç—å –≤ –¥–µ–ª–æ —á–∞–Ω, –≤—ã—Ç–∞—â–∏–ª–∏ –µ–≥–æ –∏–∑ –≤–æ—Ä–æ—Ç –∏ –ø–æ–ø–ª—ã–ª–∏\\". –°—ã—Ç–∏–Ω, —Å—Ç—Ä.274, —Ü–∏—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç \\"–°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è\\", N97 –∏ 103, 1879 Development was boosted by construction of Bryansky (now Kiyevsky) railroad terminal, originally built in wood (1900 postcard).

New Kiyevsky Terminal, designed by Ivan Rerberg and Vladimir Shukhov in 1912‚Äì1914, was completed during the Russian Civil War, in 1920. =Dorogomilovo Cathedral= Dorogomilovo used to have Moscow's second largest cathedral (after Christ the Saviour, photo), rated for 10,000 worshippers. It was set on the site of present-day corner block at 1 Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya; there are no reliable explanations why it was built in such a remote and scarcely populated place. Construction of Byzantine Revival Bogoyavlensky Church proceeded from 1898 to 1910. Originally modelled after Christ the Saviour, the design was later changed from five- domed to a single dome, and externally was the most austere of Moscow cathedrals. Starting in 1918, Bolshevik authorities began harassing the clergy, and in 1922 stripped the church of all silver and gold, causing the Dorogomilovo Riot (April 5‚Äì7, 1922). After the demolition of Christ the Saviour (1931), Dorogomilovo Cathedral was the main operating church of Russian Orthodox Church, until its destruction in 1938.Russian: –õ–µ–±–µ–¥–µ–≤–∞, –ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞, \\"–•—Ä–∞–º –±–æ–≥–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–Ω—è –≤ –î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–º–∏–ª–æ–≤–µ\\", www.pravoslavie.ru =Modern history= Dorogomilovo river bend, view from the west Kutuzovsky 26, Leonid Brezhnev's home Triumphal Arch near Victory Park In the 1920s, Dorogomilovo housed some of Moscow's post-war firsts, notably, the first new school (School No. 56 at 22 Kutuzovsky, 1927), the first new hotel (Kiyevskaya, 1934),Russian: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤, –Æ.–ù., –ñ—É–∫–æ–≤, –ö.–í., \\"–°–∏–ª—É—ç—Ç—ã –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã\\", –ú, 1978, —Å—Ç—Ä.16,23 and a student campus that gave it name to Studencheskaya Street and a metro station. In 1935, Dorogomilovo became the site of a major stalinist architecture project. A 2.7-kilometer long stretch of Dorogomilovskaya Street and Mozhaysk highway was zoned for first-rate housing construction; half of the project was actually completed before June 1941. One of these apartment blocks, 26 Kutuzovsky, is known as Leonid Brezhnev's Mikhail Suslov's and Yuri Andropov's home. Construction was completed during post-war years. In 1938‚Äì1950s, Dorogomilovo cemeteries were gradually destroyed and redeveloped; however, for a short time in 1938‚Äì1940 and in 1946, relatives were allowed to re-bury the remains at out-of-town cemeteries. Remains of Isaac Levitan were relocated from Jewish cemetery to Novodevichy Cemetery.Russian: official site www.dorogomilovo.ru A railroad track to the brewery was severed from the main line, as a result one can see an IS20 steam locomotive stranded behind factory gates. Post-war construction was concentrated on the embankments and the beginning of Kutuzovsky Prospect, notably, the Ukraina Hotel Skyscraper (1947‚Äì1952). Grand stalinist buildings completed the perimeters of large city blocks; inside, wooden shacks (photo) survived until the 1970s and were replaced with Brezhnev-era standard housing (of better-than-average variety).

The sonnets most commonly identified as the Rival Poet group exist within the Fair Youth group in sonnets 78‚Äì86. Several theories about these characters, the Rival Poet included, have been expounded, and scholarly debate continues to put forward both conflicting and compelling arguments. In the context of these theories, the speaker of the poem sees the Rival Poet as a competitor for fame, wealth and patronage. Possible candidates Among others, George Chapman, Christopher Marlowe, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Barnabe Barnes, Gervase Markham,Halliday, pp. 52, 127, 141-2, 303, 463. and Richard BarnfieldLeo Daugherty, William Shakespeare, Richard Barnfield, and the Sixth Earl of Derby, Cambria Press, 2010 have been proposed as identities for the Rival Poet. = George Chapman = Chapman was a prominent poet and translator of Homer. Scholars speculate that Shakespeare was familiar with his work, having read part of his translation of the Iliad for his own Troilus and Cressida, a dramatic reworking of Chaucer's epic poem. Chapman wrote Ovid's Banquet Of Sense, a metaphysical poem seen as a response to the erotic Venus and Adonis, which incidentally features Shakespeare's most quoted poet, Ovid. In Shakespeare and the Rival Poet, Acheson conjectures that Chapman's erotic poems were written with a view to gaining Southampton's patronage.. The moral tone of Ovid's Banquet of Sense eschews the amatory tone of Shakespeare's, and seeks to instill spiritual seriousness in a work that takes the five senses as its Conceits. Chapman's patrons also moved in the same circles as Shakespeare's; thus Shakespeare may have felt insecure about the stability of his own income versus a talented rival. Chapman was both then and now regarded as being particularly erudite, whereas, as Ben Jonson writes, Shakespeare had \\"small Latine and lesse Greeke\\".Baldwin, W. T. William Shakspere's Smalle Latine and Lesse Greeke. 1944 = Christopher Marlowe = Marlowe was more highly regarded as a dramatist than a poet, his chief poetical work, Hero and Leander, remaining incomplete at the time of his death (it was subsequently completed by Chapman). Due to Marlowe's relatively small dramatic output as compared with Shakespeare, it's unlikely that he would have been the subject of Shakespeare's sonnets, i.e. considered a serious rival. By the time Shakespeare began his works Marlowe was a well-established playwright but the two had a very important artistic relationship. In his book The Genius of Shakespeare, Jonathan Bate notes \\"the two-way traffic between Marlowe and Shakespeare until the latter‚Äôs death\\".Bate, Jonathan. The Genius of Shakespeare. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 107 Shakespeare strove to outdo Marlowe and through their artistic competition they would push one another to higher achievements in dramatic literature. This competition could have also motivated the Rival Poet sonnets.Bate, Jonathan. The Genius of Shakespeare. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 130. = Multiple poets = It has also been suggested that the Rival Poet is an amalgam of several of Shakespeare's contemporaries instead of a single person. This is indicated by the fluctuation between singular and plural addresses of the rival(s) in the sonnet sequence.Jackson, MacD. P. \\"Francis Meres and the Cultural Contexts of Shakespeare‚Äôs Rival Poet Sonnets\\". Review of English Studies. 56.224 (2005): 224‚Äì246. 16 Nov 2007: 225 In Sonnet 78 the Speaker refers to other poets who have gained inspiration from the Fair Youth but in 79 the Speaker is only concerned with one \\"he\\", a potentially \\"worthier pen\\". Sonnet 80 continues the singular reference but by 82 the Speaker reverts to the plural \\"writers\\".Jackson, 225 In 83 he refers to \\"both your poets\\" indicating that the Speaker is one poet and the Rival is the other. According to MacD. P. Jackson, Sonnet 86 is \\"the most powerful of the group [and] the most detailed in its characterization of one specific Rival Poet\\".Jackson, 226 While arguably the most powerful of this sonnet grouping, one cannot neglect the oscillation between singular and plural seen throughout the group as a whole. This discrepancy makes it difficult to isolate one specific poet to claim the title of Rival. The Speaker's attitude towards the Rival is also difficult to pinpoint. Some critics, such as R. Gittings, believe that much of the Poet's comments on his rival should be read as ironic or satiric.Robertson 180 Jackson maintains that the Poet's feelings toward the Rival shift between varying degrees of admiration and criticism. This also indicates a multitude of rivals. As the Poet's confidence ebbs and flows along with his impression of his rival(s), the identity of the rival(s) also fluctuates. A final defence for the Multiple Rivals Theory relies on a dating of the Rival Poet sonnets between 1598‚Äì1600. While this frame of reference has support, so do other possible dates and there will always be controversy regarding dating of individual sonnets. However, if it is assumed that this grouping was published between 1598 and 1600, a publication by Francis Meres comes into play. In 1598, Meres published Palladis Tamia; Wits Treasury with a chapter titled \\"A Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with the Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets\\" in which he documents the critical esteem of the poets of the day.Jackson 233 Shakespeare received high praise for his dramatic work but Marlowe and Chapman were deemed England's \\"two excellent poets\\".qtd. in Jackson 234 This, according to Jackson, \\"must surely have helped provoke the Rival Poet series\\".Jackson 234 Footnotes References * * Bach, Alice.

It first appeared in June 1952 and was built until 1954. It was a development of the Simca 8, from which it differed by being lengthened a bit (a few centimetres or inches) between the rear edge of the door and the bulge of the rear fender, to provide more interior room. More importantly, the 9 Sport was of a unibody design. This meant that the car was not offered as a convertible, although a small number of 9 Sport convertibles were built, using the chassis of the earlier 8 Sport. The mechanics were the same as for the Simca Aronde, although the engine was upgraded from . Its running gear was similar to that of the Simca 8 Sport, with the same iteration of the engine, benefitting from a higher compression ratio. The car was built by Facel-M√©tallon in Colombes. In September 1952, the 1953 Simca 9 Sport featured all-new bodywork, curvier and with more glazing. Again, it featured steel bodywork of Facel's manufacture, and, again, it was heavier and thus no faster than the Aronde sedan on which the expensive Sport was based.

Olivier and Richardson were a decade into their fifty-year friendship and were in the process of staging a theatrical version of Othello, with Richardson in the title role and Olivier as Iago, when this film was made.Olivier 1982, p. 68. Q Planes was produced by Irving Asher, an American, with British film impresario Alexander Korda as executive producer.Aldgate and Richards 1994, p. 79. The name Q Planes may have been derived from the British \\"Q-ships\\", armed ships disguised as merchantmen, used in the First World War as decoys to lure German U-boats. The film was directed by an American, Tim Whelan (Sidewalks of London, and later in 1940, co-director of The Thief of Bagdad), who had lived in Britain since 1932, working for Korda at Denham Studios. Plot In September 1938, advanced British aircraft prototypes carrying experimental and secret equipment are vanishing with their crews on test flights. No one can fathom why, not even spymaster Major Hammond (Ralph Richardson) or his sister Kay (Valerie Hobson), a newspaper reporter, who is working undercover in the works canteen at the Barrett & Ward Aircraft Company. At first, Major Hammond is seen as an outsider at the aircraft factory, especially by Mr. Barrett, the owner (George Merritt), who is working under a government contract. Hammond soon finds a friend in star pilot, Tony McVane (Laurence Olivier), who helps him try to solve the case. Hammond becomes convinced that Jenkins (George Curzon), the company secretary at the factory, is a foreign agent and mole but Jenkins is killed by gunmen firing from a moving car before he can give up the names of his contacts. McVane returns to the aircraft factory, determined to make the next test flight. His aircraft, like the others, is brought down by a powerful ray beamed from a mysterious salvage ship S.S. Viking, manned by a foreign crew. Although the nationality of the crew and agents aboard the ship is only implied, it was understood by audiences, \\"All of the crew speak with German accents and little doubt is left who the villains are\\", wrote Variety. The aircraft, McVane and the crew are taken hostage on Viking, where he discovers that many other missing airmen have suffered the same fate. Gathering up weapons, McVane leads the survivors in an attempt to take control of the ship. Major Hammond learns the truth and directs a Royal Navy ship () to come to their rescue. Kay and McVane form a relationship and Hammond learns, to his chagrin, that his long- time lady friend, whose plans with him are repeatedly being cancelled as the action escalates, has married someone else.

Lord Vansittart was, after all, a friend of executive producer Alexander Korda. After searching and finding pieces of the missing prototype, Vansittart asked Korda to make this film and provided Secret Service funds to help him do so. Written and produced in September 1938, Q Planes was a knock-off for Olivier, already bound for America and the prestigious filming of Wuthering Heights (1939) but Richardson, who had encouraged Olivier to take the role of Heathcliff with his famous advice, \\"Bit of fame. Good.\\", was always better at comedy and dominates much of the screen, with a sardonic performance as a spy, either working for Scotland Yard or British Military Intelligence.Olivier 1986, p. 261.Holden 1990, p. 137.O'Connor 1985, p. 106. Q Planes is historically interesting for its contrast to later British war films and to Olivier's later film career. The film might be called the last of the \\"neutral Britain\\" spy comedies, which Hitchcock had pioneered in The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938). The tone of Q Planes blends a spy thriller with high-tech villains, sophisticated romance and rapid-fire comedy. The British later excelled at this genre in the James Bond films from the 1960s (Jack Whittington co-wrote Thunderball [1965]) but here the comedic aspects are in contrast to the ardent, patriotic, sombre films that the British made once war was declared and Hitler began to conquer all of Europe while Britain stood by, seemingly helpless.\\"Britain's World War II films were more than just propaganda.\\" independent.co, 22 October 2011. Retrieved: 6 December 2015. Reception Q Planes was released in the U.S. as Clouds Over Europe, on 30 June 1939. Despite its subject, Q Planes is mainly a comedy, \\"a sort of Thin Man in an espionage setting\\", wrote Picturegoer. The film received positive reviews, with much of its success due to Ralph Richardson, who cleverly held together the comedy and dramatic elements as Major Hammond. Kinematograph Weekly described Q Planes as \\"rousing espionage, romantic melodrama, staged in the best happy-go-lucky but pukka British tradition\\". C. A. Lejeune called the film \\"a bright, vigorous little picture, and Mr. Richardson's Major is the brightest thing in it. You should see it. You'll like it. It has savour\\".Halliwell 2003, p. 678. Leslie Halliwell called it a \\"lively, lovely thriller distinguished by a droll leading performance. Dilys Powell wrote of Olivier that she recalled \\"being surprised that the actor made so slight an impression\\" and described him as \\"dashing but undistinguished\\".Morley 1977, p. 22. For Olivier scholars and fans, Q Planes shows the dramatic difference his subsequent American work with Wyler and Hitchcock made on his film acting. Here, Olivier is at the height of the glib, self-conscious acting style of the 15 pictures he had made before his work with Wyler.Spoto 1992, p. 2,127. Olivier wrote that it was only then that he learned to stop condescending to pictures as a mere paycheck between Shakespeare productions and instead master acting for the camera as its own form.Olivier 1986, pp. 260‚Äì261. The New York Times film critic Frank S. Nugent was initially put off by the film's new opening which, unlike the British release, reflected an ever-darkening scenario of war with Nazi Germany. Hoping to impress this on their reluctant American cousins, the executive producer Korda was Churchill's designated producer, in the filmic aspect of de-neutralising America. The film began with \\"shots of Commons, Parliament, the War Office, the India Office, No. 10 Downing Street and other imposing edifices\\", as described by Nugent.Korda 2002, pp. 138‚Äì139. \\"As an added touch of dignity and authority, a commentator's voice noted each building as it passed, spoke gravely of the burden of empire, of trade and population statistics, and of the might and wisdom of Britain's leaders ‚Ä¶\\" Nugent expressed relief when this made-for- America preamble turns into the British comedy it originally was and praised it as \\"one of the wittiest and pleasantest comedies that have come a capering to the American screen this season\\".Nugent, Frank S. \\"The Screen in Review: Comedy lifts its head again in 'Clouds Over Europe' at the Music Hall.\\" The New York Times, 16 June 1939.

There are ongoing efforts to sell it overseas to countries such as New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. The aircraft is to supplant and replace the older Kawasaki C-1 turbofan transport that has been in service since the 1970s. Development After researching foreign aircraft such as the C-130J Super Hercules, C-17 Globemaster III, and Airbus A400M, the Japanese Ministry of Defense concluded that there was no aircraft in production that possessed the capabilities that the JASDF required. In response to this need, the Japanese MOD commenced the production of plans to develop an indigenously designed and manufactured transport aircraft. In 1995, Kawasaki appealed to the Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) to issue funding for the development of a domestically- built C-X transport aircraft.Lewis, Paul. \\"Kawasaki presses JDA for transport- launch cash.\\" Flight International, 18 January 1995. In 2000, the JDA began forming its requirement for the replacement military airlifter; early determinations for the proposed project included that it would be powered by turbofan engines, possess the range to reach Hawaii from Japan, and carry double the payload of the C-130.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Japanese fine tune military transport requirement.\\" Flight International, 28 March 2000. In May 2001, the MOD formally issued a request for proposals in regards to the new transport aircraft, referred to as the C-X program; at the time, the MOD planned to procure 40 aircraft to replace its aging Kawasaki C-1 and C-130 Hercules fleets.Doyle, Andrew. \\"Japan's hopes for CX/MPX commonality fade.\\" Flight International, 26 June 2001.

They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different high lift devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and gear control unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.\\"\\"Boeing Team Wins $3.89 Billion Multi- Mission Maritime Aircraft Program.\\" Boeing, 14 May 2004.

The delay will increase the program cost by 40 billion yen ($390 million) to 260 billion yen in addition to delays to the program. In March 2016, it was reported that the C-2 program faced delays of five years from its initial schedule due to technical problems, while development costs were then estimated to hit ¬•264.3 billion, ¬•80 billion more than initially projected. Kawasaki has also studied the development of a civil-orientated version of the C-2 with ambitions to sell the type to commercial operators. In this variant, tentatively designated as the YC-X, little modification is envisioned from the C-2, making use of transferable technologies from the military airlifter, although the intended payload is likely to be increased from the C-2's 26-ton maximum to 37-tons.Govindasamy, Siva. \\"Kawasaki talks civil.\\" Flight International, 23 September 2008.

The major Dutch cities of Rotterdam, The Hague, Leiden, Haarlem, Amsterdam and Utrecht surround this area. Cities inside the Groene Hart include Zoetermeer, Alphen aan den Rijn, Gouda, Woerden and the smaller cities of Schoonhoven, Oudewater, Haastrecht, Nieuwkoop, Montfoort, Waddinxveen, Bodegraven and Boskoop. The Groene Hart is characterized by its rural character which contrasts the urban areas around it. Agriculture, nature and recreation are the primary activities in the Groene Hart. Residents and urban visitors can often find rest and many green spaces. Mills, dikes and Dutch cows are the primary landmarks of this lowland area. Because of the various separated cycle paths in the Groene Hart, the area can very well be explored by bike. The Groene Hart is of major importance to consolidate the number of Dutch meadow birds. The bird species black-tailed godwit, northern lapwing, and Eurasian oystercatcher can all be found in the area.  History  Since the Dutch Golden Age there has been a ring of cities surrounding a green and open central area. This area was given the nickname of \\"Groene Hart\\" by the middle of the twentieth century. The Groene Hart developed in the area between the large cities in western Netherlands as an area of wet meadows and marshland. These wetlands were not suitable for building but instead were used for agriculture and peat production.  Geography  Location of the Groene Hart in the Netherlands The Groene Hart is a water-rich area, with bodies of water such as Langeraarse Plassen, Nieuwkoopse plassen, Reeuwijkse plassen, the Kagerplassen and the Braassemermeer. In addition, rivers such as the Hollandse IJssel, the Oude Rijn, the Lek, the Vlist, the Loet, the Rotte, and the Meije run through the area. One of the European footpaths runs through the area. In the Netherlands this is known as the Floris V-pad, part of the Dutch LAW 1-3 path. Also the Limes (former northern border of the Roman empire in The Netherlands) is one of the historical topics included in the Groene Hart.  Dutch government policy  A Dutch government policy was adopted in 2003 to preserve the Groene Hart. It allows for the larger cities on the edge of the Groene Hart to build limited amounts of housing. The government also limits the establishment of greenhouses and other types of commercial buildings within the area. The upcoming plan for the development of the Groene Hart includes four areas: *Around the outside of the Groene Hart is the Randstad ring of cities. This is an urban area that almost completely surrounds the Groene Hart. Between these urban areas lie green environs that connect to other green sections of the Netherlands. *Connected to the Randstad Ring is an extended area with lots of water and forests. This is used for recreation and as a buffer against urban sprawl. *There will be four core areas for nature and water sports. There will be extended areas of bogs, marshes, and other types of wet forests. These four areas - De Venen, de Krimpenerwaard, Vechtplassen and Hollandse Plassen - will be connected to each other with grassy berms. *Between the core areas and the outer areas will be pastures for nature, recreation, and agriculture.

Masum Shah was the governor of Mughal Emperor Akbar who appointed him as the Nawab of Sukkur. The minaret was built in about 1607 the monument, built of red brick, is more or less conical in shape, slightly off the perpendicular and surmounted by a dome to which an internal stone staircase gives an access. It is about 26 metres in circumference and has 84 steps to the top. It is about 31 metres feet in height and can be seen from miles away. This minaret is believed to have been used as a watch tower. The courtyard around the minaret is the cemetery where Mir Mausum Shah and his family members are buried.

Function The protein encoded by this gene is expressed in Langerhans cells which are immature dendritic cells of the epidermis and mucosa. Additionally it is known by the name C-type lectin domain family 4 member K (CD antigen CD207). It is also expressed in several other dendritic cell types including dermal CD103+ DCs and splenic CD8+ DCs. Langerin is localized in the Birbeck granules, organelles present in the cytoplasm of Langerhans cells and consisting of superimposed and zippered membranes. It is a C-type lectin with mannose binding specificity, and it has been proposed that mannose binding by this protein leads to internalization of antigen into Birbeck granules and providing access to a nonclassical antigen- processing pathway. Clinical significance Langerin on mucosal Langerhans cells of the human genital epithelium binds to HIV-1 and subsequently internalizes it into Birbeck granules to be degraded.

The facility existed between 1862 until the mid-1950s. History =Construction= In 1860 the directors of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway decided to purchase of land, formerly part of the Long Hedge farm in Battersea, to establish their new locomotive works and motive power depot. The site was on the south side of the London and South Western Railway main line at Stewarts Lane. By February 1862 an erecting shop for twelve locomotives, and a running shed for 26 locomotives had been completed, and by the end of the year a carriage works was also completed on the site. Further extensions were made in 1875/6 and 1880/1. =Activities= The new works was initially used by the locomotive superintendent William Martley for the repair and rebuilding of the existing locomotive stock, with new locomotives obtained from outside contractors. However, in 1869 he began the construction of three new Enigma class 2-4-0 locomotives there. However, it was not until the appointment of William Kirtley as locomotive superintendent in 1876 that the works were again used for new construction with further examples of Martley‚Äôs Europa class 2-4-0 locomotives, Kirtley‚Äôs own T class 0-6-0T and his M1, M2 and M3 class 4-4-0 express passenger locomotives. Following Kirtley‚Äôs retirement in 1898 on the formation of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, Ashford became the major locomotive works for the new company, but the new Locomotive, Carriage & Wagon Superintendent H. S. Wainwright used Longhedge works for the construction of some examples of his SECR C class 0-6-0 freight locomotives in 1902‚Äì04. Thereafter the works was used for heavy repairs until 1911, when much of the equipment and machinery was transferred to Ashford, leaving only the capacity to undertake light repairs associated with the adjoining Stewarts Lane motive power depot. =The site today= After the creation of the Southern Railway in 1923, the nearby Battersea depot of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway was closed and Stewarts Lane grew to become the largest steam motive power depot of the system. Most of the buildings of Longhedge works were demolished in 1957 to make way for a new depot for servicing electric trains. The site is now occupied by the Stewarts Lane Traction Maintenance Depot.

The one-way pair of MD 129 passes between the Upton neighborhood to the southwest and Madison Park to the northeast. The northbound direction passes southwest of Renaissance Academy at Lafayette Street. Both streets pass through Druid Heights, where they intersect North Avenue, which carries US 1 and US 40 Truck. MD 129's constituent streets pass between the Reservoir Hill neighborhood to the northeast and Penn-North to the southwest. McCulloh Street and Druid Hill Avenue come together as a divided highway called Auchentoroly Terrace (also known as Swann Drive) at Druid Park Lake Drive, where MD 129 starts to follow the southwestern edge of Druid Hill Park and the northeastern edge of the Woodbrook neighborhood. Northbound MD 129 has three to five lanes while the southbound direction has three travel lanes. The boulevard passes the Howard Peters Rawlings Conservatory and Botanic Gardens of Baltimore then intersects Liberty Heights Avenue, which becomes MD 26 west of MD 140, and Greenspring Avenue, which enters the park and provides access to The Maryland Zoo. One block north of that intersection, MD 129 meets MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at an oblique directional intersection that prevents direct access from northbound MD 129 to southbound MD 140 and from northbound MD 140 to southbound MD 129, movements which are provided via Liberty Heights Avenue. MD 129 and MD 140 follow eight-lane divided Reisterstown Road for three blocks between Druid Hill Park and the Liberty Square neighborhood to the west. At Druid Park Drive, the two routes diverge, with MD 129 heading north onto six- lane divided Park Heights Avenue. MD 129 and MD 140 parallel each other one block apart through the Park Circle neighborhood, site of the Park Circle Historic District, and into Central Park Heights, where the two routes intersect Cold Spring Lane and then veer away from each other. Park Heights Avenue becomes a four-lane undivided highway shortly before Belvedere Avenue, where the highway passes the western edge of Pimlico Race Course, the site of the Preakness Stakes. MD 129 passes between the Pimlico neighborhood to the northeast and Arlington to the southwest, then intersects Northern Parkway. The state highway passes through the affluent Glen neighborhood and between the heavily Jewish neighborhoods of Cross Country to the northeast and Fallstaff to the southwest before intersecting Slade Avenue at the northwest corner of the city of Baltimore, just north of Temple Oheb Shalom. MD 129 southbound past its northern terminus at Garrison Forest Road in Worthington Once in Baltimore County, MD 129 veers north, reduces to two lanes, and passes between the Suburban Park Golf Course to the west and the Dumbarton Historic District on the east. At the north end of both complexes, the state highway intersects Old Court Road, which heads east as MD 133. MD 129 passes Druid Ridge Cemetery before temporarily expanding to a four-lane divided highway for its half-diamond interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The east leg of the intersection with the exit ramp from eastbound I-695 is Brooks Robinson Drive, which is unsigned MD 129A and connects MD 129 with the complementary half-diamond interchange at Stevenson Road. A short distance north of I-695, MD 129 exits Pikesville and enters a rural area with scattered estate residences. The state highway crosses Jones Falls and intersects MD 130 west of the hamlet of Stevenson. North of Caves Road, MD 129 passes to the east of Caves Valley Historic District and through the affluent Worthington area before reaching its northern terminus at Garrison Forest Road east of Reisterstown. MD 129 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial between US 40 and MD 140 within Baltimore. History Park Heights Avenue was paved from the Baltimore city limits near Cold Spring Lane north to Caves Road by 1910. The avenue was proposed for improvement south to Reisterstown Road. There were also plans to improve Park Heights Avenue north to its current terminus and extend the avenue toward northern Baltimore County along the route following by Garrison Forest Road, Greenspring Avenue, Tufton Avenue, Mantua Mill Road, Green Road, Butler Road, and Falls Road north to Mount Carmel Road. The segments along Butler Road and Falls Road became part of MD 128 and MD 25, respectively. The remainder of the route north of MD 129's terminus remained county roads. Park Heights Avenue between Cold Spring Lane and Reisterstown Road and Reisterstown Road south to Liberty Heights Avenue were paved in concrete by 1921. By 1923, Park Heights Road between Caves Road and Garrison Forest Road was paved in macadam, completing the highway in Baltimore County. That same year, Druid Hill Avenue was reconstructed with concrete from Paca Street to Druid Hill Park. The portion of Park Heights Avenue from Cold Spring Lane to Belvedere Avenue was reconstructed with concrete in 1924 and 1925. McCulloh Street was paved with concrete around 1933. By 1950, Park Heights Avenue was expanded to a divided highway from Reisterstown Road to Belvedere Avenue. Druid Hill Avenue and McCulloh Street became a one-way pair by 1955. Auchentoroly Terrace was completed by 1963, thus completing MD 129's modern route within the city of Baltimore. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 129A is the designation for Brooks Robinson Drive, which spans between MD 129 and Stevenson Road parallel to the eastbound direction of I-695 in Pikesville. MD 129A is a two- lane road that connects the complementary half-diamond interchanges between I-695 and MD 129 at the west end of the highway and Stevenson Road at the east end. MD 129A was assigned no later than 1972. The highway was formerly known as Radio Tower Drive. In 2007, the route was renamed for Brooks Robinson, the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Famer.

DuringPresidio Fire Department station logbooks, Golden Gate National Recreation Area Park Archives the 1940s, '50s and '60s the Presidio's Firehouse served as the headquarters station to a much larger department consisting of many Stations located at the various forts around San Francisco such as: Fort Baker, Fort Barry, Fort Funston, Fort Mason, Fort Winfield- Scott, Fort Cronkhite, Chrisy Field, and Angel Island along with fire prevention duties and air show fire protection at Hamilton Air Force Base after its closure and prior to its transfer to the City of Novato. Although most of the firehouses have long since been demolished, some still stand such as those located at the Presidio of San Francisco's Main Post, Fort Cronkhite, Fort Mason and Angel Island. The National Park Service maintains the daily log books dating back to the 1940s from several of the department's stations in the Park Archives of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and they are available to the public for viewing. Over the years the Presidio Fire Department was reduced and left with two fire stations. Fire Station 1 was located in the Presidio of San Francisco's Main Post and Fire Station 2 was located in the Marin Headlands at Fort Cronkhite. In 1994, as a result of the Presidio of San Francisco's closure under the Base Realignment and Closure act the Presidio Fire Department and staff was transferred from the Department of the Army to the National Park Service and became the only full-time fire department within the National Park Servicehttp://www.nps.gov/prsf/historyculture/fire-station.htm under the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Division of Visitor Protection. However, as indicated by report #RECD-00-154 issued by the Government Accountability Office in 2000; the National Park Service as a whole was unable to effectively operate its various fire protection programs throughout the country. The GGNRA was no exception to this, and after years of struggling attempting to operate the Presidio Fire Department, the GGNRA began exploringhttp://www.sfexaminer.com/local/garcia-presidio-firefight options to rid themselves of the management burden of running a full-time fire Department. Current status =Station 1= On August 27, 2010, responsibility for fire protection services was transferred to the San Francisco Fire Department under contracts for services between the SFFD, National Park Service and the Presidio Trust. The SFFD now operates out of the existing firehouse (Building 218) in the Presidio as SFFD Station 51. =Station 2= On November 10, 2010, in violation of a Federal Labor Relations Authority Arbitrator's recent rulinghttp://presidiofirefighters.com/index.cfm?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&HomeID;=173477 to increase staffing and meet response time standards, Station 2 was closedhttps://web.archive.org/web/20110207230813/http://www.xmrfire.org/som/news.aspx?ID=47 permanently by the National Park Service and the remaining employees were laid off. Fire protection services are now provided under contract from the Southern Marin Fire Protection District located 5.5 miles away in downtown Sausalito. Fire Station 2 (Building 1045) and its apparatus now sit unused at Fort Cronkhite. Historyhttp://www.nps.gov/prsf/historyculture/fire- station.htm =Early history= In the late 19th century, Presidio soldiers gained notoriety for fighting wild fires in California‚Äôs National Parks. After the 1906 earthquake, Presidio troops came to the assistance San Francisco during the fire that followed, eventually stopping it at a firebreak that they dynamited along Van Ness Avenue. However, the army received much criticism from city residents, who claimed the dynamiting operations were disorganized and people were removed from their houses long before the fire was a threat. Within the Presidio, the army was plagued by fires in the old wooden buildings, many of which were more than 50 years old, had flammable roofs and open, coal-burning fireplaces with defective flues. In addition, the Presidio had no professionally trained firefighters and lacked a good fire prevention plan. =A catalyst for change= A series of fatal fires at the Presidio in the early 1900s culminated in the notorious Pershing fire of 1915. This fire killed four members of General John Pershing‚Äôs family. Mrs. Pershing, the daughter of Senator Francis E. Warren of Wyoming, and three of the four Pershing children suffocated in the early morning hours after coal from an unattended dining room fireplace fell to the floor, leading to a quick- spreading fire in the old wooden house. =Establishment= The Presidio Fire Station in 1929 After the Pershing fire, Senator Warren led a congressional mandate for improved fire fighting resources at the Presidio. At the same time, San Francisco fire chief Thomas Murphy recommended establishing a permanent fire company at the Presidio. Based on Chief Murphy‚Äôs recommendations and encouraged by an embarrassed United States government, the army built a fire station in 1917. The new Presidio Fire Station was the first on any U.S. Army post to house a permanent fire company with trained firefighters. =Presidio firefighters to the rescue= Response to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake showed how much the Presidio Fire Department had changed since the early years. Firefighters from the department proved it to be a well-trained and effective ‚Äúfirst response‚Äù organization. A mutual response agreement ‚Äì not used since the 1906 earthquake ‚Äì between the army and the San Francisco allowed the city to request Presidio Fire Department support for a house fire in the Marina. The Presidio crew was first to reach the fire at Beach and Divisadero. Actions taken by the Presidio Department at that time prompted commendations from Congresswoman Barbara Boxer, the Marina Neighborhood Organization, and the Phoenix Society, a highly regarded firefighters‚Äô organization. =A National Park Service first= In 1994, management of the Presidio was transferred from the Department of Defense to the Department of the Interior. At that time, the Presidio Fire Department became the only National Park Service fire department to be staffed 24 hours a day. The National Park Service has focused on a new role for the modern firefighter, that of a well-trained emergency paramedic. The importance of this expanded role for firefighters is evident in that 90% of emergency calls are for paramedic units, making the Presidio Fire Department a vital ‚Äúfirst response‚Äù station for the Presidio community. =Restoration= The Presidio Fire Station was recently rehabilitated to bring it up to earthquake code, and to enlarge it to accommodate modern fire fighting equipment. Many of the original features of the historic 1917 structure were restored, such as the historic wood windows and sectional apparatus bay doors. Non-historic additions were removed, and a new wing compatible with the original building architecture was added. Finally, elements of the historic landscape were brought back to the site, which is very prominent to visitors arriving at the Main Post.

Thomas Alfred Coward, MSc, FZS, FRES, MBOU (8 January 1867 ‚Äì 29 January 1933), was an English ornithologist and an amateur astronomer. He wrote extensively on natural history, local history and Cheshire. Life He was born at 8 Higher Downs, Bowdon, Cheshire (now Greater Manchester) on 8 January 1867, the fourth and last child of Thomas and Sarah Coward. His father was a Congregational minister and in business as a partner in the firm of Melland and Coward, textile bleachers. Coward's siblings were Charles, Alice and Annie. After an education at Brooklands School, Sale and at Owens College (now Manchester University), Coward worked in the family business for 19 years, before it was taken over by the Bleachers' Association. His share of the proceeds from the sale of Melland and Coward was sufficient to allow him to retire from business and concentrate on his love of wildlife and the study of birds, which had developed as a child. He began writing articles on natural history for newspapers including The Liverpool Daily Post, The Chester Cournant and The Manchester Guardian for which he wrote the \\"Country Diary\\" column until his death. General interest magazines for which he wrote included The Field and Country Life and in specialist journals such as The Zoologist, Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London and British Birds. His first book was The Birds of Cheshire, published in 1900, when he was living in Hale. His three-volume The Birds of the British Isles and their eggs (1920‚Äì25) was illustrated by Archibald Thorburn and was \\"acknowledged as being the book that did more to popularise the study of birds than any other publication produced during the first part of the twentieth century\\". It was revised by Arnold Boyd for a new edition in 1950. He co-wrote articles and books on ornithology with Charles Oldham, a former schoolmate. He married his cousin Mary Milne in 1904. There is a Blue Plaque at his former home, Brentwood Villa, 6 Grange Road, Bowdon, to which he moved in 1911. On his death, the Cotterill Clough Nature Reserve was bought, by public subscription, in his honour. His field notes are archived in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. = Jizz = Coward is credited with the first use in print of the term \\"Jizz\\", in his \\"Country Diary\\" column of 6 December 1921 - the piece was subsequently included in his 1922 book \\"Bird Haunts and Nature Memories\\".

Plot Space Major Reeves, a rocket expert and friend of Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray), leaves Cloudbase after completing a tour of the facility. He departs in a motor yacht for the island military installation Base Concord, unaware that Captain Black is watching from the shore. Black uses the Mysterons' powers to induce nausea in Reeves, who falls overboard and drowns in the yacht's slipstream. A Mysteron reconstruction of Reeves arrives at Base Concord, shoots the control room officer and launches an incendiary variable-geometry rocket (VGR) under the control code \\"ZERO\\". He then escapes in a J-17 fighter jet, with the flight program unit in his possession, leaving the base personnel no way of knowing the VGR's target or which of the 10,000 listed codes must be transmitted to trigger its self-destruct. In addition, for reasons unknown the VGR is not appearing on radar. The commander of Base Concord alerts Spectrum and White dispatches Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) to Base Concord. Meanwhile, the Angel squadron are launched to track down Reeves and recover the unit. Reeves is quickly intercepted but refuses to surrender, instead crippling Melody's (voiced by Sylvia Anderson) aircraft with the J-17's machine gun and forcing her to eject before she crashes into the ocean. At Base Concord, Scarlet, Blue and the base personnel realise that the VGR would be invisible to radar only if it were travelling upwards, and that because its descent would be equally vertical the only plausible target is the base itself. A replacement unit is installed and the personnel use it to transmit codes one after the other in a desperate effort to find the one used by Reeves, to no avail. In the air, Reeves ignores Rhapsody's (voiced by Liz Morgan) order to surrender and deliberately kills himself when he crashes his fighter, causing the original unit, which survived the crash, to fall to the ocean floor. Minutes before impact, and with Base Concord fully evacuated except for Scarlet and Blue, White radios them and instructs them to leave. However, in a last-ditch effort to save the base, Scarlet and Blue disobey White and carry on trying codes. \\"AMEN\\" is the code used, but at the same time, the sunken unit is knocked over by an underwater current and the impact causes it to re-transmit \\"ZERO\\", triggering the VGR's self-destruct. Scarlet and Blue return to Cloudbase believing that they miraculously found the correct code. When the truth is revealed, White reprimands them for their insubordination but stops short of court-martialling them, recognising the value of their bravery in the fight against the Mysterons. Production \\"Renegade Rocket\\" was filmed on Century 21's Stage 3 over two weeks beginning on 27 February 1967. The miniature model of the J-17 fighter was built with parts from an Airfix Dassault Mirage III model kit. The incidental music, performed by an ensemble of 12 instrumentalists, was recorded during a four-and-a-half-hour studio session held on 14 May 1967. Music for \\"Operation Time\\" was recorded during the same session. Reception Anthony Clark of sci-fi-online.com describes \\"Renegade Rocket\\" as \\"just about average\\" and \\"about as dull as [Captain Scarlet] gets\\". He views the episode as an example of the series' \\"patchy\\" quality and questions Scarlet and Blue's motives for disobeying White given the extremely low chances of their finding the correct code. Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine suggests that the plot \\"could have similarly serviced a sitcom\\" and regards the episode as considerably less \\"gripping\\" than \\"Point 783\\". In a review for the Andersonic website, Vincent Law argues that \\"Renegade Rocket\\" is one of many Anderson productions to focus on the dangers of \\"runaway machinery\\". Noting that the Mysteron reconstruction of Reeves effectively pulls rank on an officer to launch the VGR, he compares the character to a Cold War double agent and the episode as a whole to the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove. He criticises the dialogue and characterisation ‚Äì questioning, for example, White's lack of emotional response to the death of his friend Reeves. Despite praising the episode's visuals, Law sums up \\"Renegade Rocket\\" as \\"a forerunner of effects-led films like Independence Day and its ilk ‚Äî flashy, nice to look at but insubstantial and ultimately unfulfilling.\\" Chris Bentley, author of Captain Scarlet: The Vault, criticises the editing of the sequence in which the VGR makes its final approach to Base Concord, pointing out that White, who is counting down the seconds to impact, reaches zero even though the rocket is destroyed before it hits. He calls the sequence \\"baffling\\".

Developing out of a tropical wave on August 23, Barry quickly strengthened off the coast of Florida, reaching an initial peak intensity with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). However, increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken to a tropical depression before making landfall near Melbourne, Florida, the next morning. Traveling almost due west, the storm regenerated and became a hurricane on August 28\\\\. The storm made landfall on the northern Mexican coastline later that day at peak intensity. Rapid weakening followed shortly after and the storm dissipated the next day. The storm had only minor effects in the United States but destroyed hundreds of homes and left over 400 homeless in northern Mexico. Despite the damage, there were no reports of fatalities or injuries. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Barry can be traced to a tropical wave which moved off the western coast of Africa on August 13, 1983. Strong wind shear in the North Atlantic hurricane basin prevented significant development of the system as it traveled towards the west-northwest. Little convection was associated with the disturbance as a result of the shear. While approaching the Bahamas on August 22, an upper-level trough moved away from the system, which led to a decrease in the wind shear. The disturbance then entered this environment and spawned an area of low pressure which intensified. On August 23, the low had become sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Four. Later that day, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Barry by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). About 12 hours after becoming a tropical storm, Barry reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Barry then began a westerly course towards central Florida. However, wind shear began to increase, causing the system to weaken. The NHC downgraded the storm back to a tropical depression on August 25. Barry made landfall near Melbourne, Florida the same morning with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). After crossing Florida, the depression traveled towards the west-southwest due to a strong upper-level flow. On August 27, Barry became sufficiently organized to be reclassified as a tropical storm while located in the central Gulf of Mexico. The re-strengthening was the result of decreased wind shear and more favorable conditions over the Gulf. The storm continued to become better organized as it traveled nearly due west towards Mexico. At 1200 UTC the next day, Barry was upgraded to a hurricane while located about 75 mi (120 km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The hurricane continued to intensify until it made landfall about 35 mi (55 km) south-southeast of Brownsville at peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The storm quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated the next day over northern Mexico. Preparations Tropical Storm Barry on August 24 off the coast of Florida =United States= Several watches and warnings were issued along the Florida and Texas coastlines as a result of Barry. The first was a gale warning from Jupiter Inlet, Florida to Savannah, Georgia on August 24 at 1900 UTC. The warning was discontinued from St. Augustine to Savannah the next day. The next was a gale warning issued for Brownsville, Texas to Port O'Connor, Texas on August 27\\\\. This was upgraded into a hurricane warning as Barry strengthened a few hours later, and then extended to Mansfield. The warning was discontinued by late August 28. Over 4,000 people were evacuated from South Padre Island in preparation of Hurricane Barry. Several thousand people were evacuated from beaches in Port Aransas on August 27 as Barry approached. An estimated 700 people took refuge in shelters set up in Brownsville and 800 people fled to schools, which were being used as temporary shelters, in Harlingen. An additional 2,000 residents evacuated from Harlingen. Shelters were also opened in San Benito, Santa Rosa, and Los Fresnos. Offshore, several oil platforms were evacuated in the Gulf of Mexico. =Mexico= In the Mexican city of Matamoros, located south of Brownsville, Texas, Captain Manuel Leon Lopez warned residents about the approaching hurricane through radio messages. Many people were seen leaving coastal villages and heading further inland. Mexican officials raised the alert level to stage three due to the threat of Barry. Impact and aftermath Storm total rainfall from Barry in the United States =United States= Rainfall around 1 in (25 mm) were reported around Lake Okeechobee, 3 inches (76.2 mm) around the Orlando area and 1 in (25 mm) in the Miami area. The peak rainfall was 3.01 in (76 mm) in Wauchula, Florida. Roads with poor drainage in Key West, Florida were flooded after the area received 1.5 in (38.1 mm) of rain. Barry also affected the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger, whose third mission was scheduled for August 30. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) did not have time to return the shuttle to the hangar in time for the storm and had the shuttle ride out the storm on the launch pad. The only rainfall reported in Texas by Barry was around San Antonio. Along the Texas coast, beach erosion was caused from waves that were higher than normal. Winds were gusting in excess of 50 mph (85 km/h) off the South Padre Island coast. Near Brownsville, a possible tornado knocked down power lines, leaving an estimated 6,000 people without power. =Mexico= No casualties were reported from Barry. However, 30 fishing boats were sunk in Mexico and several hundred homes were destroyed. The rainfall from the hurricane was considered to be relief from drought conditions in parts of northern Mexico. A storm surge of was recorded in Mexican fishing villages. Over 400 people were made homeless and there was a major loss of shrimping nets. At least ten people were left homeless in the town of El Mezquital. Homes in Santa Teresa sustained some damage but none were destroyed. Only one person was injured by the storm after shards from a broken window hit the child. Following the storm, General Jesus Ponce de Leon Rodriguez went to survey the damage in Tamaulipas along with a medical team.

In 428 BC, the Mytilenean government planned a rebellion in concert with Sparta, Boeotia, and certain other cities on the island, and began preparing to revolt by fortifying the city and laying in supplies for a prolonged war. These preparations were interrupted by the Athenian fleet, which had been notified of the plot, and the Mytileneans sent representatives to Athens to discuss a settlement, but simultaneously dispatched a secret embassy to Sparta to request support. The attempt to reach a settlement at Athens fell through, as the Athenians were unwilling to allow their loyal ally Methymna to be subjugated by the Mytileneans, and the Athenian fleet blockaded Mytilene by sea. Sparta, although it agreed to send support and prepared a fleet, was cowed by an Athenian show of force and took no action at this time. On Lesbos, meanwhile, the arrival of 1,000 Athenian hoplites allowed Athens to complete the investment of Mytilene by walling it in on land. Although Sparta finally dispatched a fleet in the summer of 427 BC, it advanced with such caution and so many delays that it arrived in the vicinity of Lesbos only in time to receive news of Mytilene's surrender. In the wake of the Mytileneans' surrender, a heated debate took place at Athens over their fate. One faction, led by Cleon, advocated executing all of the men in the city and enslaving the women and children, while another faction (one spokesman was Diodotus) preferred more moderate treatment in which only men who had been identified as ringleaders would be executed. The Athenian assembly wavered; an order for mass execution was issued on the first day of debate but countermanded on the next. In the end, the city as a whole was spared, but 1,000 \\"ringleaders\\" (although this figure is viewed sceptically, and it is believed that due to a misreading by a scribe, the figure was actually closer to 30) were executed without trial. Plan and preparations The Mytilenean government (which was oligarchic) had considered revolting from Athens even before the Peloponnesian War broke out, but when they initially approached Sparta in the 430s BC, the Spartans would not promise to accept them into the Peloponnesian League. Without the necessary Spartan support that would have made revolt feasible, the Mytileneans' plan came to nothing.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the events leading up to the revolt are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.2. In 428, however, the Mytilenean leaders judged that the time was ripe for revolt, and both Boeotia and Sparta participated in planning the rebellion. The primary motivation for the rebellion was the Mytilenean's desire to gain control of all of Lesbos; Athens generally discouraged the creation of multi-city subunits of the empire, and would certainly not have permitted Lesbos to be unified.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 100-101 Moreover, Mytilene's privileged status as an independent state, commanding its own fleet, within the Athenian empire seems to have given its leaders both confidence in their chances of success and concern that, if they did not revolt, they might in the future be reduced to the same tributary status as the majority of Athens' allies.Legon, Megara and Mytilene, 201 The Mytileneans, therefore, began strengthening their fortifications and sent for mercenaries and supplies from the Black Sea region. Before they had completed their preparations, however, their plans were betrayed to the Athenians by several of their enemies in the region, namely the Methymnians and Tenedians, and by a group of Mytilenean citizens who represented Athens' interests in that city (probably members of the democratic faction there).Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 101 The revolt =Initial moves= The Athenians, who were still suffering from the plague at this time and were under great financial strain from the unexpectedly long and involved war, initially tried to negotiate in order to avoid taking on yet another military commitment in Lesbos.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the Athenian reaction and the initial battle are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.3-4. When the Mytileneans refused to abandon their plans to unify Lesbos or their preparations for war, however, the Athenians resigned themselves to the necessity of a military response and dispatched a fleet to Mytilene; ten Mytilenean triremes which had been serving in the fleet were interned at Athens with their crews. The initial plan was for the fleet to arrive during a religious festival for which all the Mytileneans would be outside of the city, and during which it would be easy for the Athenians to seize the fortifications of the town. Since this plan was crafted in the open Athenian assembly, however, it was impossible to keep it secret, and the Mytileneans had ample warning of the fleet's approach. On the day of the festival, they remained in the city, with doubled guards on the weaker sections of the walls; the Athenians, arriving to find the city well defended, ordered the Mytileneans to surrender their fleet and tear down their walls. The Mytileneans refused this demand, and even went so far as to send their fleet to fight the Athenians just outside the harbor. When the Athenians quickly defeated this fleet and drove it back into the harbor, however, the Mytileneans quickly agreed to negotiate, arranged an armistice on the scene, and sent representatives to Athens. In doing this, however, the Mytilenean government was aiming not at reaching an accommodation with Athens, but rather at buying time for their negotiations with Sparta and Boeotia to bear fruit. As the representatives were on their way to Athens, a second group was secretly dispatched to Sparta to secure that city's support in the rebellion. =Failure of negotiations and resumption of fighting= The negotiations at Athens were brief and unsuccessful. The Mytileneans offered to remain loyal if the Athenians would withdraw their fleet from Lesbos.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.4 Implicit in this proposition was that the Athenians would abandon Methymna, and that the Athenians could not do, as failing to protect a subject city from aggression would have undermined their claims to legitimacy as rulers of their empire.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 101-102 The Athenians, accordingly, rejected the Mytilenean offer, and when the ambassadors returned to Lesbos bearing this news all the cities of Lesbos save Methymna openly declared war on Athens.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the early fighting on Lesbos are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.5-6. The Mytileneans mustered an army and marched out to attack the Athenian camp; although they came off slightly the better in the ensuing battle, they were unwilling to press their advantage and retreated back behind their fortifications before nightfall. At this point the Athenians, encouraged by the lack of initiative on their enemies' part, summoned troops from their allies and, once these arrived, built two fortified camps, one on either side of Mytilene's harbor. From these they instituted a naval blockade of the city (the Mytileneans and their allies continued to control all the land outside the Athenian fortifications). =Sparta wavers= Immediately after the Mytilenean attack on the Athenian camp, a trireme bearing ambassadors from Sparta and Boeotia slipped past the Athenians into Mytilene and persuaded the Mytileneans to send a second group of ambassadors to plead for Spartan intervention (the Spartans and Boeotians had been dispatched before the revolt, but had been prevented from entering the city for some time).Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.5 This second group of Mytilenean ambassadors arrived within a week of the first, in July, but neither secured any immediate assistance; the Spartans deferred the decision over Mytilene to the Peloponnesian League as a whole, which would be convening at Olympia later that summer.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 102 At that meeting, the Mytilenean ambassadors gave a speech in which they gave justifications for their revolt, emphasized Athens' weakness, and stressed the importance of attacking the Athenians in the empire, from which they drew their resources.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.9-14 After hearing this speech, the Spartans and their allies voted to accept the Lesbians into their alliance and attack Athens immediately in support of the revolt.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.15 The plans made at Olympia called for all the allied states to send their contingents to the isthmus of Corinth to join together and prepare to advance on Athens.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the Peloponnesians' actions and the Athenian response are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.15-16. The Spartan contingent was the first to arrive, and set about dragging ships across the isthmus from the gulf of Corinth so as to be able to attack simultaneously on land and sea. While the Spartans set enthusiastically about this work, however, the other allies sent in their contingents only slowly; the harvest was underway, and the allies were tired of constant military service (their service had already been called on that summer for a month-long invasion of Attica beginning in May).Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 100 The Athenians, meanwhile, aware that the Peloponnesian's readiness to attack derived in part from the Mytileneans' assertions that Athens was critically weakened, prepared a fleet of 100 ships to raid the coast of the Peloponnese. Preparing the fleet required extreme measures, as the state's resources were already stretched thin; as not enough thetes (poor citizens) were available for service to crew the fleet fully, both zeugitai (landowners who usually fought as hoplites) and metics (resident aliens) were recruited to serve as rowers.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 103 The fleet raided at will along the Peloponnesian coast, and the Spartans, who had been promised that the forty ships at Mytilene and the forty that had circumnavigated the Peloponnese earlier in the summer were all the Athenians could muster,Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.13 concluded that they had been deceived and called off their plans to launch an attack that summer. =Fighting on Lesbos= While the Spartan force was at the isthmus making its preparations, the Mytileneans and their allies launched an attack on Methymna, expecting that the city would be betrayed to them from within.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the fighting on Lesbos are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.18. In the event, however, the promised betrayal failed to materialize, and the attack was repulsed. The Mytileneans returned home, stopping along the way to help strengthen the fortifications of several of their allies near Methymna. Once the Mytileneans were gone, the Methymnians marched out against one of these cities, Antissa, and were defeated by the Antissans and their mercenaries in fighting outside that city's walls. At this point the Athenians, realizing that their force at Lesbos was insufficient to cope with the Mytilineans, dispatched an additional 1,000 hoplites to the scene. The Athenians at Lesbos were now able to gain control of the land around Mytilene and build a wall of circumvallation around the city, completing the blockade of the city. =Siege, relief effort, and surrender= To pay the expenses of the ongoing siege in their current state of financial crisis, the Athenians were forced to turn to two extraordinary measures. First, they imposed an eisphora, or direct tax, on their own citizens.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.19 Ancient Greeks were extremely reluctant to use measures such as this, which were regarded as an imposition on personal freedom, and in fact this may have been the first time that such a tax was ever imposed at Athens.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 104-5 At the same time, Athens announced an increase in the tribute assessments for its subjects, and twelve ships were sent out to collect the new assessments several months before the usual time; this action clearly triggered resistance, as one of the generals commanding these ships was killed while attempting to make collections in Caria.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 104 In the summer of 427 BC, the Spartans and their allies planned a concerted effort on land and sea to strain Athens' resources and relieve the siege at Mytilene. The annual invasion of Attica that year was the second largest of the Archidamian War, exceeded in duration and destructiveness only by that of 430.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 26. While this invasion was underway, 42 ships under the command of the navarch Alcidas were sent out to Mytilene; the plan was that the Athenians would be preoccupied with the invasion and unable to devote their full attention to Alcidas and his fleet. At Mytilene, however, time was rapidly running out for the Peloponnesians to come to the rescue. A Spartan representative, Salaethus, had been smuggled into the city in a trireme at the end of the winter with news of the relief scheme, and had taken command of the defenses there in anticipation of the fleet's arrival.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.25 Food supplies in the city, however, were exhausted at some point early in the summer, and, since the fleet had yet to materialize, Salaethus was forced to gamble on a breakout attempt.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the proposed breakout and the surrender are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.27-28. Hoplite armor was issued to all the citizens, most of whom heretofore had only served as light troops, in preparation for this attempt. Once the people were thus armed, however, they refused to obey the government and demanded that the authorities distribute any remaining food supplies, threatening to come to terms with the Athenians on their own if this was not done. Realizing that they could not prevent this, and that a peace concluded without their involvement would surely be fatal to them, the members of the government contacted the Athenian commander and surrendered, on the condition that none of the Mytileneans should be imprisoned, enslaved, or executed until representatives from the city had presented their case at Athens. While these events were taking place, Alcidas advanced slowly and cautiously with his fleet, wasting a great deal of time in rounding the Peloponnese. Although he succeeded in giving the Athenians the slip and reaching Delos without being discovered, he reached Erythrae on the coast of Ionia a few days later only to learn that Mytilene had already fallen.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.29 At this point the commander of the contingent from Elis advocated launching an attack on the Athenians at Mytilene, arguing that since they had only recently taken the city they would be off their guard and vulnerable to a surprise attack.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding Alcidas' campaign in the Aegean are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.30-33. Alcidas, however, was unwilling to attempt such a bold action, and also rejected a plan to seize some Ionian city as a base from which to foment rebellion in the empire. Indeed, once he learned of Mytilene's surrender Alcidas's primary goal was to return home without having to confront the Athenian fleet, and he accordingly began sailing southwards down the Ionian coast. Off Clarus he was spotted by the Athenian messenger ships Paralus and Salaminia, and the Athenian fleet set out from Mytilene to pursue him. Alcidas, however, set out from Ephesus in full flight back to the Peloponnese, neither landing nor stopping until he was safely home, and thus escaped his pursuers. After this, the Athenians returned to Lesbos and reduced the remaining rebellious cities there.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.35 Debate at Athens After he completed subduing Mytilene, Paches sent the greater part of his army back to Athens, and sent with it the Mytileneans whom he had identified as particularly culpable in the revolt and the captured Spartan general Salaethus. Salaethus was executed immediately, although he suggested that, in return for his life, he would have the Spartan force besieging Plataea withdrawn.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.36 The assembly then turned its attention to the question of what to do with the prisoners at Athens and the rest of the Mytileneans back on Lesbos. What followed was one of the most famous debates in the history of the Athenian democracy, and one of only two occasions on which Thucydides records the content, and perhaps some of the actual words, of the opposing speeches in the assembly.Wasserman, Post- Periclean Democracy in Athens, 27 As such, the debate has been the subject of much scholarly analysis, aimed elucidating both the circumstances of the revolt and the internal politics of Athens at that time. =Thucydides' account= The debate reported by Thucydides took place over two days. On the first day, the events of which Thucydides only summarizes, the Athenians angrily condemned the entire male population of Mytilene to death, and the women and children to slavery.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the first day's debate are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.36. The citizens were particularly enraged that the revolt had brought a Spartan fleet into Ionian waters, where it would never have passed in normal circumstances and where no enemy fleet had sailed in over 20 years. In accordance with the assembly's decision, a trireme was dispatched to Mytilene bearing orders for Paches to execute the Mytilenean men. On the next day, however, as the Athenians considered the severity of the measure they had just passed, a number of citizens began to have second thoughts.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding events leading up to Cleon's speech are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.36. Aware of this trend, the Mytilenean delegation that had been sent to Athens to present that city's case asked the prytanies to call a meeting of the assembly, and those officials acquiesced. At that meeting, a debate took place between those who supported the previous day's decree and those who called for a milder punishment. The first speech that Thucydides records was given by Cleon, who had proposed the previous day's motion. This speech marks Cleon's first appearance in the historical record, and Thucydides introduces him by saying that \\"he was remarkable among the Athenians for the violence of his character, and at this time he exercised far the greatest influence over the people.\\" In Cleon's speech, as reported by Thucydides, the politician argues that consistent enforcement of laws, even when they seem unjust, is the only way to maintaining order, and moreover that the Mytilenean people as a whole (not merely the aristocracy) had revolted against Athens, and thus deserved to be condemned.Cleon's speech is recounted by Thucydides at 3.37-40. The speech is filled with acerbic criticism of the Athenian people, and of certain elements of the ideology of democracy, and it lays out an imperial ideology that openly describes Athens' rule as a tyranny and embraces it as such.Andrews, Cleon's Hidden Appeals, 46 Part of Cleon's speech was devoted to attacking those who would speak against him, maintaining that anyone who would speak on behalf of the Mytileneans must have been bribed.Andrewes, The Mytilene Debate, 72 Certain elements of the speech evoke arguments made by Pericles in his famous funeral oration, and it is clear that Cleon, as portrayed by Thucydides, is deliberately laying claim to aspects of Pericles' mantle of leadership with his speech.Wasserman, Post-Periclean Democracy, 33 In content, the speech emphasizes the favored status that Mytilene had held before the revolt, asserts that the city as a whole bears responsibility for the revolt, and argues that a favored city that revolts must be treated harshly so as to deter others from following.Kagan, The Archidamian War, 157 After Cleon's speech, Thucydides presents a speech by Diodotus, a politician who appears only this once in recorded history, but who, Thucydides reports, had also spoken against Cleon's proposal the previous day.Diodotus' speech is recounted by Thucydides at 3.42-48. He is identified as \\"Diodotus, son of Eucrates\\";Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.41 the Eucrates in question is presumably a fairly prominent lieutenant of Pericles mentioned on several occasions before this.Kagan, The Archidamian War, 126 The early portion of Diodotus' speech is devoted to refuting the charges that Cleon had preemptively levelled against those who would speak after him, principally by arguing that the assembly would deprive itself of wise counsel if it constantly examined the motives of speakers instead of the arguments they presented.Wasserman, Post-Periclean Democracy, 36 Next Diodotus attacks Cleon's claim that harshness would deter future revolts, on the grounds that no state revolts in the expectation of failure, and that the more useful countermeasure, therefore, is a mild punishment that will allow for reconsideration when the revolt appears likely to fail. Throughout the speech, Diodotus refuses to stray from the grounds of expediency, reminding the Athenians that they sit not as a court of law but as political assembly, dedicated to determining what action is most advantageous for Athens. On the issue of culpability, however, he flatly denies that the demos shares in the guilt of the oligarchs, and warns the assembly against alienating its potential friends throughout the empire.An abstract of the content of Diodotus' speech may be found in Kagan, The Archidamian War, 160-2. After speeches on the motion concluded, the assembly voted, by a narrow margin, to overturn the previous day's decree.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the remainder of the debate and the aftermath are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.49-50. Cleon then put forward a second motion proposing the execution, without trial, of the 1,000 Lesbians whom Paches had selected out as most responsible for the rebellion; that motion was carried without recorded discussion. A ship was immediately dispatched to Mytilene to countermand the execution order sent out the previous day. The Mytilenean representatives in Athens offered a sizable reward to the crew if the ship arrived in time to prevent the executions. Rowing day and night, sleeping in shifts, and eating at their oars, the rowers of the second trireme managed to make up the first ship's one day lead and arrive at Mytilene just as Paches was reading the original order, in time to prevent its execution. =Modern analyses= Authenticity of the speeches As with all the speeches reported by Thucydides, the resemblance between Cleon's and Diodotus' speeches as the historian recorded them and the speeches actually given has been the subject of much debate. In the famous passage where he lays out his methodology for reporting the content of speeches, Thucydides states that \\"my habit has been to make the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various occasions, of course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what they really said.\\"Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.22 Various historians have either stressed the first clause of this sentence and reached the conclusion that Thucydides put words into his speakers' mouths or emphasized the second clause and concluded that Thucydides' speeches maintain the basic sense of the speeches actually given on the various occasions he describes.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the scholarly conflict over the authenticity of Thucydides' speeches are drawn from Andrewes, The Mytilene Debate, 66-67. Still other scholars take the second approach but conclude that Thucydides strayed from this approach over his writing career; a number of schemes for dating the authorship of the various speeches has also been proposed, without any gaining a preponderance of support. Popularity of the Athenian Empire Diodotus' speech contains the famous claim that \\"in all the cities the people is your friend, and either does not revolt with the oligarchy, or, if forced to do so, becomes at once the enemy of the insurgents; so that in the war with the hostile city you have the masses on your side.\\"Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.47 Modern scholars have disagreed over whether this was actually the case. G.E.M. de Ste. Croix accepted Diodotus' statement as factual, and took the Mytilenean demos's threat to hand over the city as evidence that they had harbored secret pro-Athenian feelings throughout the siege. Some other scholars, meanwhile, have suggested that the threat was the action of men desperate because of hunger, but harboring no special regard for the Athenians. A third position is presented by Daniel Gillis, who observes that the Mytilenean demos would not necessarily have surrendered under less desperate circumstances, but was at least confident enough regarding its fate after a surrender to consider that action a viable alternative.A summary of this scholarly debate as it pertains to Mytilene specifically may be found in Gillis, The Revolt at Mytilene, 41. Both Donald Kagan and Ronald Legon, meanwhile, have emphasized that, whatever the feelings of the Mytilenean demos were, the people had clearly not displayed enough revolutionary sentiment to prevent their rulers from distributing arms to them.See Kagan, The Archidamian War, 152 n. 16 and Legon, Megara and Mytilene, 206. Aftermath Although Mytilene's citizens were spared execution, a harsh punishment was still imposed on the rebellious Lesbians.Unless otherwise noted, all details regarding the sanctions imposed on Lesbos are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 3.50. All the farmland on the island, save that belonging to the Methymnaeans, was confiscated and divided up into 3,000 lots, which were leased back to the Lesbians on a yearly basis. 300 of these lots were dedicated to the gods, and the 10 talents collected from them annually went into the Athenian treasury; the remainder supported a garrison of Athenian cleruchs.See Kagan, The Archidamian War, 166 for the sum and destination of the money raised from the land dedicated to the gods. All Mytilene's possessions on the Ionian mainland were confiscated by Athens, its walls were pulled down, and its ships were confiscated. For the Athenians, this solution solved several problems; the garrison would provide security on Lesbos, and the absence of its members from Athens would to an extent ease the overpopulation of that city and the strain on the treasury resulting from the need to feed thousands of displaced farmers.Kagan, The Archidamian War, 166 The garrison returned home by the mid 420s BC, but apparently Athens was mistaken to think the island secure; in 412 BC, in the wake of the disaster in Syracuse, Lesbos was among the first islands to begin intriguing against the newly weakened Athenians.Legon, Megara and Mytilene, 211 In an anecdote that some have connected with the Mytilene affair, Plutarch reports that Paches killed himself during a trial at some point after his command at Mytilene.Plutarch, Nicias 6.1 Donald Kagan has interpreted this anecdote to indicate that Paches, a moderate, was being prosecuted by Cleon or another more aggressive politician, who disapproved of his decision to break off the pursuit of Alcidas' fleet.Kagan, The Archidamian War, 167-8 References Sources =Ancient= *Diodorus Siculus, Library * * =Modern= *Andrewes, Arthur. \\"The Mytilene Debate: Thucydides 3.36-49\\".

Route description PA 288 heading eastbound along with PA 65 southbound across the Connoquenessing Creek PA 288 begins at an intersection with PA 18 in the borough of Wampum, Lawrence County, heading north on two-lane undivided Main Street. The road passes through wooded areas and turns northwest, crossing under Norfolk Southern's Koppel Secondary railroad line before running to the west of CSX's Pittsburgh Subdivision railroad line and passing under Norfolk Southern's Youngstown Line. The route heads into residential areas and turns northeast onto Wampum Road, passing over the CSX line before crossing the Beaver River into Wayne Township. PA 288 passes through woods before curving southeast and running through the residential community of Chewton, running to the southwest of the P&W; Subdivision railroad line, which is owned by CSX and operated by the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad, before passing over it. The road continues between farmland to the northeast and woods, along with the P&W; Subdivision, the Youngstown Line, and the Beaver River, to the southwest. The route curves south into forested areas, turning east to head away from the river and railroad lines and pass through the residential community of Rock Point. PA 288 runs between homes to the north and woods to the south, heading into the borough of Ellwood City. Here, the route comes to an intersection with PA 65 and turns south to form a concurrency with that route on 5th Street, crossing the Connoquenessing Creek. The two routes head into residential and commercial areas, turning east onto Fountain Avenue. PA 65/PA 288 turns south onto 2nd Street, with PA 488 continuing east on Fountain Avenue. The road heads south through residential areas, passing over the P&W; Subdivision line as a two-lane divided highway before becoming undivided again intersecting the eastern terminus of PA 351. Following this, the two routes head into industrial areas. PA 65/PA 288 continues into Beaver County, passing through more industrial sections of Ellwood City before running through urban residential areas and widening into a four-lane divided highway. At this point, the road passes near more homes separated from the road by trees, heading into North Sewickley Township and becoming Ellwood-Zelienople Road. The two routes turn to the east and cross the Connoquenessing Creek again into Franklin Township before PA 65 splits from PA 288 by turning south. The route continues east, passing under the P&W; Subdivision and heading near more homes. The road passes a few businesses and narrows back into a two-lane undivided road, heading into wooded areas with a few residences. PA 288 continues into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, passing through Lillyville and turning to the southeast. The road becomes Zelienople Road and heads through more open agricultural areas with occasional woods and homes before heading south of Hereford Manor Lake. The route turns south through more wooded and agricultural areas, passing to the east of Zelienople Municipal Airport before making a turn to the southeast. PA 288 enters the borough of Zelienople in Butler County and becomes West New Castle Street, passing homes to the north and fields to the south as it comes to an intersection with PA 588. At this point, PA 588 joins the route for the remainder of its length, however it is unsigned along PA 288. The road crosses Connoquenessing Creek again and heads into industrial areas, crossing a Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad line.

Starting from Hyundai Apartment complex in Gangnam, Seoul, Korea City Development had built apartments around the country and emerged as the largest private housing builder in the early 1980s, introducing apartment as a new housing style in Korea. Halla Construction, founded by Chung In-yung, brother to Chung Ju-yung, the founder and former chairman of Hyundai Group, focused on civil engineering, plant and overseas businesses. Halla Construction built a number of power plants including Samcheonpo Thermal Power Plant, civil engineering projects such as road construction, land reclamation, port development and other various projects in Korea. Halla Construction actively pursued overseas business and undertook road, construction and plant projects in the Middle East and Southeast, starting from the Jizan cement plant project in Saudi Arabia in 1977. Established in 1986, HDC Hyundai Development Company has emerged as a comprehensive construction company, building up on Korea City Development's strength in the housing business and Halla Construction's leading position in the civil engineering segment. As Korea‚Äôs leading developer, Hyundai Development Company has maintained its leadership in the domestic housing market, been active in the construction, civil engineering and plant industries and expanded its businesses to include engineering and plastic materials with the establishment of the petrochemical unit. With the inauguration of Chairman Chung Mong-gyu and honorary president Chung Se-yung in 1999, Hyundai Development Company was separated from Hyundai Group in August 1999. Thereafter, Hyundai Development Company has evolved into the parent in HDC Group. Hyundai Development Company ranks top in the domestic housing market and is active in various technically demanding areas such as super high-rise buildings, spatial structures, roads, bridges, ports and plants. Hyundai Development Company launched a new brand, IPARK, in March 2001. As part of its efforts to fulfill its corporate social responsibilities, the company created a charity organization, IPARK Volunteers, in 2004 and established a scholarship organization, PONY Chung Foundation in 2005. In November 2019, HDC Hyundai Development Company was selected as the preferred bidder for financially troubled Asiana Airlines. Areas of business =Housing business= Since its establishment in 1976, Hyundai Development Company has built more than 400,000 housing units in Korea, starting from its Hyundai Apartment Complex in Gangnam with 6,000 units. In terms of housing units constructed, Hyundai Development Company ranks top in Korea. Hyundai Development Company specializes in the housing market among Hyundai Group‚Äôs construction subsidiaries. Hyundai Development Company was the first builder, which enabled prospective residents to conduct preliminary quality checks before their move-ins, bearing standards for quality service and construction. Hyundai Apartments built by Hyundai Development Company had been synonymous with apartments in Korea. After Chairman Chung Mong-Gyu took the reins, Hyundai Development Company launched a new apartment brand IPARK in March 2001, adding a sophisticated and upscale touch to Hyundai apartments‚Äô sturdy, trustworthy image. Hyundai Development Company continues to build up its reputation, creating landmarks across the country such as IPARK apartment complexes in the most-coveted areas such as Samsung-dong in Seoul, Haeundae in Busan and Suwon in Gyeonggi-do. =Construction = Hyundai Development Company has emerged as a leading company in the large venue construction, completing the world's largest office building, Gangnam Finance Center in 2002, and building sports facilities across the nation, including Daejeon World Cup Stadium with a semi-retractable roof, the first of its kind in Korea, and Korea‚Äôs first domed baseball stadium. Hyundai Development Company has been active in the super high-rise building market, completing a 45-story office building complex, Gangnam Finance Center, a 46-story high Samsung-dong IPARK and a 72-story high Haeundae IPARK (2011). Hyundai Development Company has also pursued various construction projects including Yongsan Express Train Terminal Private Equity Project, one of the largest multi-purpose cultural centers in Asia, other retail facilities, educational facilities, hotels, production and exhibition facilities. =Civil engineering= Hyundai Development Company has undertaken civil engineering projects in various areas such as roads, bridges, ports and railways, which require advanced technologies. Hyundai Development Company has taken part in the construction of key expressways around the country such as Gyeongbu Expressway, Jungbu Expressway, Seoul Circular and Namhae Expressway and proved its technological prowess in various bridge projects such as Bukhang Bridge, Gwangan Bridge and Hantan Bridge. Starting from the pilot section of Gyeongbu High Speed Way, Hyundai Development Company has taken part in various subway, railway and high-tech speed rail projects such as High Speed Railway in the Greater Seoul Area and Honam High Speed Railway. Hyundai Development Company is active in both publicly and privately financed projects. Starting from New Daegu-Busan Expressway, Hyundai Development has undertaken privately financed SOC projects in the road and railway segments such as Seoul Chuncheon Highway, Suseok- Hopyeong Expressway, Gangnam Beltway and Busan-Gimhae Light Rail Transit. Hyundai Development Company has also undertaken various SOC projects in the port development segment such as 1-1 phase of the Ulsan New Port, 1-1 phase of the Masan Port, 2-3 and 2-4 phases of the Busan New Port and East Pier of the Pyeongtaek Port. In addition, Hyundai Development Company has undertaken other SOC projects such as Bukhang Bridge and Daegu Art Museum. =Plant business= Halla Construction, Hyundai Development's predecessor, constructed the Samcheonpo thermal power plant in South Gyeongsang Province. Hyundai Development Company has also undertaken various plant projects such as desulphurization facilities, gas supply, gasoline stations, incineration plants and water treatment facilities. Hyundai Development Company has expanded its market reach globally and conducted Jizan Cement Plant Project in Saudi Arabia and constructed power plants, sulfur production plants, water treatment facilities in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. It has further been expanding its plant business such as Dongducheon LNG combined cycle power plant project and Tongyong Combined-Cycle power plant.

The Stowe Psalter (British Library Stowe MS 2, also known as Spelman Psalter or King Alfred's Psalter) is a psalter from the \\"2nd or 3rd quarter of the 11th century\\",BL catalogue, \\"Stowe 2\\" at the end of Anglo-Saxon art. The text includes the Gallican version of the Psalms, followed by the Canticles with an interlinear Old English gloss. Description This Psalter is closely related to the Tiberius Psalter (British Library Cotton MS. Tiberius C.VI). Both Psalters have identical prayers added to the end of each psalm. The Psalters also each have large initial \\"B\\"s, Beatus initials, at the beginning of Psalm 1 which closely resemble each other in form. The Anglo-Saxon glosses appear to have been written at the same time as the Latin text. There are 180 extant vellum folios. The folios are 220 by 180 mm, with the text being written in an area of 225 by 120 mm. In its current binding there are two vellum flyleaves that are not counted in the foliation of the manuscript. Two folios at the end of the Canticles have been cut away. The manuscript was re-bound in tooled leather during the 17th century. The text is written in English half-uncials, while the titles of the Psalms are written in rustic capitals. The large decorated Beatus initial at the beginning of Psalm 1 (folio 1r), and smaller decorated initials at the beginning of Psalm 51 (folio 56r) and Psalm 101 (folio 111v), are the only major decorations in the manuscript, a common pattern in psalters. Other divisions in the text are marked by smaller colored initials. There are occasional marginal ritual directions and antiphons added in a 15th-century hand. There are also a few added marginal decorations. The manuscript was probably created at the abbey of New Minster, in Winchester. There are three other manuscripts from New Minster that were written by the scribe of this manuscript. The manuscript is signed on folio 9 recto \\"Kateryn Rudston\\" in a 16th-century hand. It belonged to Sir Henry Spelman, who signed it on folios 1 recto and 180 verso. An edition of the text was published by Spelman's son.Spelman, J., Psalterium Davidis Latino-Saxonicum vetus, a Johanne Spelmanno D. Hen. fil. editum, e vetustissimo exemplari MS. in bibliotheca ipsius Henrici, et cum tribus aliis non minus vetustis collatum, (London, 1640) It was sold by Walter Clavell in 1742. The manuscript was later owned by Thomas Astle, who called it King Alfred's Psalter. Astle included a facsimile of folio 1 verso in his Origin and Progress of Writing.Astle, T., Origin and Progress of Writing, p. 86, and plate xix. no. 6, London, T. Payne and Son, 1784. It was owned by the Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos- Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos and kept at Stowe House. It contains his press mark inside the front cover. In 1849 it was sold by the his son, along with the rest of the manuscripts from Stowe House to Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham. In 1883, the British Museum purchased this manuscript, along with 1084 other manuscripts from the Stowe collection, from the 5th Earl of Ashburnham.

Their migratory routes stretched from El Aai√∫n down towards Dakhla, parallel to the coast of the territory. Like all Sahrawis, they are Sunni Muslims of the Maliki madhhab. Origins They hold the status as a Chorfa tribe, i.e. claiming descent from the Prophet Muhammad. Their tribal ancestor, the famous Sidi Ahmed Al Aroussi (or Laaroussi, died in 1593, 30 km near to Semara in Western Sahara), descends from the Beni Arrous tribe neat Larache and comes from a lineage of the Alami religious order founded by Abu Bakr al-Alami al-Idrissi and Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish al-Alami. He was claimed to have performed miracles: according to tribal lore, he was lifted to safety by angels, after having once been captured - for unclear reasons - by the Sultan of Morocco. Population today Laaroussien Sahrawis are present both in the Tindouf refugee camps of Algeria, headquarters of the nationalist and independence-seeking Polisario Front, and in their traditional home areas of Western Sahara; these are situated west of the Moroccan Wall, and thus under Moroccan rule.

Valve-sealing screw A gas spring is a type of spring that, unlike a typical mechanical spring that relies on elastic deformation, uses compressed gas contained within an enclosed cylinder sealed by a sliding piston to pneumatically store potential energy and withstand external force applied parallel to the direction of the piston shaft. Common applications include automobiles (where they are incorporated into the design of struts that support the weight of the hatchback tailgate while they are open) and office chairs. They are also used in furniture, medical and aerospace applications. Much larger gas springs are found in machines that are used in industrial manufacturing (the press tooling industry), where the forces they are required to exert often range from 2500N to 400,000N (forty tonnes). Types Gas springs are manufactured in many varieties including: * Standard cylinder * Fixed-height cylinder * Spindle only * Cable cylinder * Stage cylinder * Non-rotating cylinder * Return cylinder (no height adjustment) * Auto-return cylinder with height adjustment * Bouncing cylinder * Dual-mode cylinder * Heavy duty cylinder *Oil damper Forms If the internal plunger has a diaphragm which extends to the side of the gas tube, it will cease to move once an applied force is constant and will support a weight, like a normal spring. If a fine hole exists in the plunger, however, it is termed a \\"slow-dampened spring\\" and can be used on heavy doors and windows. A gas spring designed for fast operation is termed a \\"quick gas spring\\" and is used in the manufacture of air guns and recoil buffers. Reducing the gas volume and hence increasing its internal pressure by means of a movable end stop, or allowing one tube to slide over another, can allow the characteristics of a gas spring to be adjusted during operation. The rod may be hollow by use of clever seals or may consist of multiple small-diameter rods. A small amount of oil is normally present. The gas may be introduced by a Schrader-type valve, using a lip seal around the rod and forcing it to allow gas in by external overpressure or a shuttling O-ring system. Gas springs of high pressure contain a very large amount of energy and can be used as a power pack. In emergency use the gas may be introduced via a gas generator cell, similar to those used in airbags. Passive heave compensators features large gas springs. The stroke lengths can exceed 6 meter. Features A variety of features are available from various manufacturers: *Adjustable push-in force via a local knob or remote via a bowden wire. *Single touch release to allow full extension or the ability to lock it out. *Extended stroke through telescoping mechanisms, usually composed of one rod and two cylinders (the smaller of the two cylinders actually acts as a second rod extending in and out of the larger cylinder). * Vari-lift - intended for short production runs and prototypes, in applications where the exact force is important but hard to estimate in advance, such as lifting a lid slowly in a known time. In this case the cylinder is supplied filled to maximum design pressure, but equipped with a bleed port, to allow gas to be released once installed. The intention is that the design can be over-sprung, and then the pressure reduced in stages, to optimise behaviour. If too much gas is released, a new spring must be installed, and for large quantities, it is better to order a bespoke pressure setting from the maker. *Degressive springs where the spring becomes more, not less, powerful as the main cylinder expands.https://patents.google.com/patent/US5833218 References * https://www.metrol.com/gas_springs_faq * https://zhiliqi.m.en.alibaba.com/ * http://www.camloc.com/tech-support/how-gas-springs-work/ * DIN 4550 * http://gassprings.wix.com/support#!what-is-a-gas-spring/cu7l * https://www.gas-springs.com/ * http://www.supersen.com *https://www.geminigassprings.com * https://industrialgassprings.com/aerospace/ Category:Springs (mechanical) ","title":"Gas spring"},{"id":"9882879","text":"Jackie Marchand is a television writer and producer, she is best known for her work on the children's action/adventure series Power Rangers,  Career  Jackie Marchand is, as of Power Rangers: Jungle Fury, the longest running veteran on the show since Judd Lynn, whom she shared co-writing duties with until she left at the end of Power Rangers: Time Force.

At mid-ocean ridges, dykes are formed when magma beneath areas of tectonic plate divergence travels through a fracture in the earlier formed oceanic crust, feeding the lavas above and cooling below the seafloor forming upright columns of igneous rock. Magma continues to cool, as the existing seafloor moves away from the area of divergence, and additional magma is intruded and cools. In some tectonic settings slices of the oceanic crust are obducted (emplaced) upon continental crust, forming an ophiolite.  Geometry  Cartoon to explain how one-sided chilled margins develop in sheeted dyke complexes from repeated intrusion at one location - four stages of intrusion are shown, with 1 being the earliest The individual dykes typically range in thickness from a few centimetres to a few metres. Most of the dykes show evidence of one-sided chilled margins, consistent with most dykes having been split by later dykes. It is also common for the chilled margins to be consistently on one side, suggesting that most dykes in any one exposure were gradually moved away from the spreading centre by further stages of intrusion in a constant location. The layer of sheeted dykes that makes up the lower part of Layer 2 of the oceanic crust is typically between one and two kilometres thick. At the top, the dykes become increasingly separated by screens of lava, while at the base they become separated by screens of gabbro.  Dyke formation  Magma rises through oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges Sheeted dyke complexes are most commonly found at divergent plate boundaries marked by the presence of mid-ocean ridges. These subaqeous mountain ranges are made up of newly-created oceanic crust due to tectonic plates moving away from each other. In response to the separation of plates, magma from the asthenosphere is subject to upwelling, pushing hot magma up towards the seafloor. The magma that reaches the surface is subject to fast cooling and creates basaltic formations such as pillow lava, a common extrusive rock created near areas of volcanic activity on the seafloor. Although some magma is able to reach the surface of oceanic crust, a considerable amount of magma solidifies within the crust. Dykes are formed when the rising magma that does not reach the surface cools into upright columns of igneous rock beneath areas of divergence. = Ophiolites = Dykes are perpetually formed as long as magma continues to flow through the plate boundary, creating a distinct, stratigraphic-like sequences of rocky columns within the seafloor. Ophiolites are formed when these sections of oceanic crust are revealed above sea level and embedded within coastal crust. Older dykes formed near divergence zones are pushed away as new seafloor is created, a phenomenon known as seafloor spreading, and over time, the oldest dykes are pushed far enough from convergence zones to be exposed above sea level.  Seafloor spreading and continental drift  (Top) Creation of rift valley due to low spreading rate. (Middle and bottom) Creation of mid-ocean ridges due to higher spreading rate. The creation of sheeted dykes is a perpetual and continuous process that promotes the phenomenon known as seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading is the creation of new oceanic crust by volcanic activity at mid-ocean ridges, and as magma continues to rise and solidify at mid-ocean ridges, the existing older dykes are pushed out of the way to make room for newer seabed. The rate at which new oceanic crust is created is referred to as spreading rate, and variations in spreading rate determine the geometry of the mid-ocean ridge being created at plate boundaries. = Fast-spreading ridges = Mid-ocean ridges with a spreading rate greater than or equal to 90 mm/year are considered to be fast-spreading ridges. Due to the large amounts magma being expelled from the asthenosphere in a relatively short period of time, these formations typically protrude much higher from the seafloor. = Slow- spreading ridges = Mid-ocean ridges with a spreading rate less than or equal to 40 mm/year are considered to be slow-spreading ridges. These formations are typically characterized by a large depression in the seafloor, known as rift valleys, and are formed due to the lack of magma present to solidify.  Examples  * Troodos Ophiolite, Cyprus * Maydan Syncline, Oman, part of the Semail Ophiolite - A sheeted dyke complex on the coast of Oman has been discovered to have been formed during a single sea-floor spreading episode. * Hole 504b, Costa Rica - Hole 504b is a scientific ocean drilling program that burrowed 1562.3 m below the seafloor directly through layers of sediment exposing sheeted dykes and pillow lava.

The party also included Clemente Mastella (ex-Christian Democratic Centre, CCD, then leader of the Christian Democrats for the Republic), Rocco Buttiglione (leader of the United Christian Democrats, CUD), Mario Segni (leader of Segni Pact), Carlo Scognamiglio (ex-Forza Italia, FI), Enrico Ferri (ex-CCD, former leader of the Italian Democratic Socialist Party and European Liberal Social Democracy) and Irene Pivetti (ex-Lega Nord), along with several other MPs elected for the centre-right. Cossiga'a sim was to facilitate the creation of a centre-left governments without the support of the Communist Refoundation Party. The UDR was initially only a federation of parties, but in June CDR, CDU and the Segni Pact merged to form a united party and Mastella was elected secretary. After disagreements between Cossiga and Mastella, the party broke up in February 1999. Most party members rallied behind Mastella and joined his Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR). Those around Cossiga formed the Union for the Republic (UpR), whose leading members (Angelo Sanza, Giorgio Rebuffa, etc.), entered in FI in 2001. The most notable exception was Carlo Scognamiglio who joined the Federation of Italian Liberals, and then European Democracy and the Pact of Liberal Democrats. Buttiglione had previously re-established the CDU, as Segni did with his Pact, while Ferri joined FI.

It caters for around 3,915 students and admission is mostly from schools in the local areas of Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire. The college is often referred to as 'Farnborough Sixth' to differentiate it from Farnborough College of Technology. Awards In 2006, the college ranked third place in the school league table for Hampshire, achieving a higher ranking for A-Level results than several highly regarded independent and private schools in the area. In 2007, the college was rated 'Outstanding' by Her Majesty‚Äôs Chief Inspector,2007 inspection report from OFSTED and it retains Beacon Status as one of the country‚Äôs top sixth form colleges. In 2010, the college was one of the first colleges nationwide to gain the 'NFER Research-Engaged Award'. In 2012, HRH Prince Philip presented the college with one of the first Duke of Edinburgh Award Operating Licences, making the college a Directly Licensed Centre in the Duke of Edinburgh Award network. The college has also attained awards including the 'Investors in People', 'Investors in Careers', 'Positive about Disabled People' and 'Fairtrade' awards. History The college was founded as the Farnborough Grammar School in September 1936, when the Aldershot County High School outgrew its premises and the boys were relocated to Farnborough. The Sixth Form College was created from 1974 to 1978, gradually enlarging as the number of Grammar School pupils reduced. Since being incorporated as a sixth form college in 1992, it has grown fast from 1,180 full-time students in 1992 to now having over 3000. Dr John J Guy was the principal from 1992 to 2010. He served on a number of government committees, including the Tomlinson Committee on 14-19 reform, and in 2001 was awarded the OBE for services to education.The Sixth Form College Farnborough - Principalship He was succeeded as principal in September 2010 by the college's deputy principal, Simon Jarvis.Farnborough Sixth Form College unveils new principal , Get Hampshire, 12 March 2010 In February 2018, it was announced that Catherine Cole, Deputy Principal (Student Services), will succeed Simon Jarvis when he steps down as Principal (and continues as CEO of the Prospect Trust) in September 2018. College facilities Cafe Direct, one of three canteens The college has undergone a major building programme costing over ¬£15 million. The first project was the Prospect Theatre and performing arts suite, which was opened by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex in 2000. Also, The Dame Kelly Holmes Sports Centre was opened on 25 April 2007 by the double Olympic gold medallist. The developments have also seen the construction of a brand new quad built in the centre of the college, and the Whitehouse Building which boasts an e-Assessment Centre - an IT centre for students to use. The latest building is the John Guy Building, a new block which replaced the former 1960s Scola block. The John Guy Building was opened by the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove in 2010 and houses the physics, computing, arts and photographic departments. It was given a BREEAM 'Excellent' rating. The college has three cafeterias: Caf√© Direct, TimeOut and Shades. The college also has two large fields which are used for sports and recreational purposes. The Simon Jarvis lecture theatre attached to the Ranson building, was opened in September 2018.  Student Association  Every March, students elect a President and Vice President, via Single Transferable Vote, whom together lead the otherwise appointed committee to organise student affairs and social activities in and outside of the college, as well as charity events. The President and Vice President sit on the Academy Quality Council. In October 2007, the 2007/2008 Student Association broke the college record, which had been set the previous year, for the most amount of money raised in a single college day; the ¬£1,800 that was raised eventually went to a variety of gene therapy charities through the 'Jeans for Genes' initiative.Students Boycott Jeans for Genes , News page on college website, 1 November 2007 In 2007 the school undertook a massive project for Red Nose Day in which over a thousand students took to the field holding red paper above their heads, first making the shape of a nose and then a 6 (the logo of the college), filmed by the BBC from a helicopter. The 2011/2012 Student Association raised over ¬£20,000 for a variety of local charities over the academic year, the highest raised for charity by the college so far. The 2012/2013 Student Association reestablished the Student College Magazine and have forged links with other local colleges through a Battle of the Bands Competition.  Enrichment  The college has established links with Presbyterian Secondary Technical School, Aburi, Ghana. This project is called the Ghana Link and it aims to broaden students from both schools' horizons and develop a two way partnership that would be of benefit to both parties.Ghanaian Students visit College from the news pages of the College website The college has a dedicated Film Production enrichment program which produces commercial and non-commercial films for outside companies and student film festivals. In March 2000, Prince Edward opened the new ¬£2.5 million Performing Arts Centre incorporating the modern 300-seat Prospect Theatre and teaching suites for music, dance and drama. One of the music enrichments making use of this facility is the biannual college Opera Project, where full- scale operas are performed by students. In 2006, the college staged The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart.News report of The Marriage of Figaro performed at the college from the news pages of the college website A performance of Engelbert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel took place in July 2008.  CristalWeb  A screenshot of CristalWeb on a staff account CristalWeb is the college's web-based management information system that allows students and staff to see the data that the college holds on them. It is extensively used within the college, to pass messages from staff to students, take registers of classes, submit absence reasons, look up exam results, amend certificates of enrichment, and edit students' personal information. It also enables access from outside the college campus to SixthNet, and its newer version: Moodle, the series of web-pages for each subject faculty containing homework, revision aids and past exam papers, in addition to information about the departments; although Moodle is gradually being phased out and replaced with Google Sites created by each subject, this is referred to as the Study Directory, and homework assigned through Google Classroom. The system has been operating since mid-2004.

Originally part of a raucous and vice-ridden section of town known as \\"The Bowery,\\" the Old City has since been revitalized through extensive redevelopment efforts carried out during the 1980s through the present.Melonee McKinney, \\"A Time of Transition an Avenue of Renaissance in Knoxville.\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 3 April 1994. Currently, the Old City is an offbeat urban neighborhood, home to several unique restaurants, bars, clubs, and shops. In spite of its name, the Old City is not the oldest section of Knoxville. Most of the neighborhood was not part of the city until the 1850s, when the arrival of the railroad encouraged the city to annex the areas north of Vine Avenue.Jack Neely, Market Square: A History of the Most Democratic Place on Earth (Knoxville, Tenn.: Market Square District Association, 2009), pp. 7, 18, 100. The railroad brought an influx of Irish immigrants, who established the Old City's first saloons and shops. After the Civil War, Knoxville developed into one of the southeast's largest wholesaling centers. Wholesalers built large warehouses, such as the ones along Jackson Avenue, where rural East Tennessee merchants came to buy the goods with which they stocked their general stores. By the early 1900s, Central Street was lined with saloons and brothels. Violent crime and prostitution continued to be a problem into the 1960s, causing many of the neighborhood's businesses to flee the area. Beginning in the 1970s, successful redevelopment efforts led by Kristopher Kendrick (who coined the name \\"Old City\\") and Peter Calandruccio revitalized the neighborhood. In 1985, most of the neighborhood's historic buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Southern Terminal and Warehouse Historic District. Location The Old City is concentrated around the intersection of Central Street and Jackson Avenue, adjacent to the Southern Terminal tracks and railyard (now part of the Norfolk Southern system). The neighborhood is roughly bounded by Magnolia Avenue on the north, Gay Street on the west, Summit Hill Drive on the south, and the interstate overpasses on the east. Interstate 40 passes just north of the Old City, and is accessible via the Downtown Loop from Summit Hill Drive. History =19th century= Detail of an 1886 map of Knoxville, showing what is now the Old City; \\"Crozier\\" is now Central Street. Building #21, the White Lily factory, is still standing. During the first half of the 19th century, Knoxville's northward expansion was slow. By 1852, Vine Avenue marked the city's northern limits. The establishment of Market Square in 1854 and the arrival of the railroad in 1855 catalyzed development north of the city, however, and by the end of 1855 the city's limits had pushed northward to what is now Emory Place.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 70-80, 226-231. The arrival of the railroad had a major impact on the city's cultural makeup, as hundreds of Irish immigrants arrived in town to help construct the railroad tracks and facilities. Many of these immigrants settled in what is now the Old City, so much so that at one point the area was known as \\"Irish Town.\\"\\"Ask Doc Knox,\\" Turn-of-the-Century Life in Knoxville's Bowery. Metro Pulse, 19 May 2010. Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015. After the Civil War, Irish businessmen began building saloons and shops along Central (originally Crozier) Street that served the city's railroad traffic. Among these businesses was a saloon built by Patrick Sullivan (1840-- 1925), which initially operated out of a wooden structure before Sullivan erected the elaborate brick building that still stands at the corner of Central and Jackson.Patrick Sullivan Steakhouse and Saloon - History. Retrieved: 10 December 2010. In 1869, Knoxville's two main rail lines merged to form the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad, which in subsequent years constructed or acquired over of track across the southeast, leading to a wholesaling and industrial boom in the city. By 1886, several factories had moved into the Old City. The Burr and Terry Sash Factory stood at what is now the intersection of Central and Jackson.Henry Wellge, Knoxville, Tenn.: County Seat of Knox County, 1886 (Milwaukee: Norris, Wellge and Company, 1886). Map. The four-story City Mills (later White Lily) plant and the Beach's Marble Works finishing mill stood along Depot, and the Elridge Carriage Factory operated near the modern corner of Central and Summit Hill. =Early 1900s= Intersection of South Central Street and West Jackson Avenue. The Patrick Sullivan's building now houses an upscale restaurant called The Lonesome Dove. By the early 1900s, Central Street had developed into a raucous area known as \\"The Bowery,\\" presumably after the New York neighborhood of similar repute. A 1900 article described the Bowery as being \\"congregated by nine-tenths of the criminal element\\" of Knoxville, and according to historian Jack Neely, \\"saloons, whorehouses, cocaine parlors, gambling dens, and poolrooms\\" lined Central from the tracks to the river.Jack Neely, Detour de Knoxville. Metro Pulse, 28 May 2008. Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015. Florida Street, which ran adjacent to Central prior to expressway construction, developed into a red-light district known as \\"Friendly Town.\\" Bar fights and shootouts were not uncommon at the Bowery's saloons. The most well-known of the Bowery's gunfights occurred at Ike Jones' bar on Central on December 13, 1901, when outlaw Kid Curry (a member of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch) shot two Knoxville police officers.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Oldest Bar.

Peace Corps \\"progenitor\\" James Herman Robinson (1907-1972) grew up in a polluted and disease-ridden slum known as \\"The Bottoms,\\" which lay adjacent to the Bowery on the banks of First Creek.James Herman Robinson, Road Without Turning: The Story of James H. Robinson (New York: Farrar, Strauss and Company, 1950), p. 17-22. In his autobiography, Road Without Turning, Robinson describes the Bottoms as the \\"lowest\\" part of Knoxville, \\"geographically, morally, and economically.\\"Robinson, Road Without Turning, p. 17. He later joined a gang which hung out at the corner of Central and Vine, where they witnessed \\"every lewd act and heard every vile phrase descriptive of it.\\"Robinson, Road Without Turning, p. 70. While the Bowery was one of the most crime-ridden sections of Knoxville, it was also one of the most diverse, and was one of the few parts of town where black-owned businesses functioned next to white-owned businesses. Black-owned businesses in the neighborhood included the Gem Theater, the Dogan-Gaither Motel, Gleaner Printing Company, and Easley's Grocery.Becky French Brewer and Douglas Stuart McDaniel, Park City (Arcadia Publishing, 2005), pp. 86-88. In the early 1900s, Greek immigrant Constantine Stergiokis opened one of Knoxville's first Greek restaurants along Central. After citywide prohibition shut down Knoxville's saloons, the Italian-American Armetta family opened an ice cream parlor in the Sullivan building. Part of the Knoxville Riot of 1919, one of the city's worst racial episodes, took place in the Bowery on August 30, 1919. Early that morning, a white woman was murdered, and police arrested Maurice Mays, a prominent local mulatto, for the crime. That afternoon, a lynch mob broke into the jail, and failing to find Mays, freed several inmates and looted the liquor storage room. As the riot spread into the streets, the rioters made their way to the Bowery, where they attacked and exchanged gunfire with black residents along Vine Avenue. The National Guard finally restored order the following morning.Bruce Wheeler, Knoxville Riot of 1919. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 12 December 2010. =Revitalization= This alley off of South Central Street is home to several apartments. As crime persisted in the Bowery, businesses began moving away. In the 1940s, JFG Coffee, which had opened its processing plant on West Jackson in 1921, threatened to move to a new location, complaining that the company's truck drivers were consistently mobbed by prostitutes. Walter McGinnis, who operated the Tri-City Barber College at the corner of Jackson and Central from 1952 until 1992, recalled that, \\"Saturday at noon, the sawmills would close, and the people who worked in the forest would come to South Central. By 5 o'clock that night they were all pretty drunk and fightin.'\\" Several scenes in Cormac McCarthy's 1979 novel, Suttree, take place in the Old City. In one scene, the title character passes along Central, where \\"loud and shoddy commerce erupted out of the dim shops into the streets and packs of scarred dogs wandered,\\" en route to sell his fish to a Central Street butcher. In another scene, a friend of Suttree's tells a story about a murderer showing off his victim's severed head at a bar on Central.Cormac McCarthy, Suttree (New York: Vintage Books, 1992), pp. 69, 203-204. The book also mentions the \\"Corner Grill\\" (later the Corner Lounge), which operated on North Central from the 1930s until 2008. During the 1970s, developer Kristopher Kendrick began buying up properties in the Old City. In a 1994 interview, Kendrick mentioned a conversation he had had with Coca-Cola bottler Patrick Roddy that would inspire the new name for the neighborhood. \\"I told him that we had bought property down there,\\" Kendrick recalled, \\"and he said, 'Kris, that's the old city,' and I said, 'Pat, that's the perfect name.'\\" By the late 1980s, several new businesses had opened in the Old City, including Annie's (whose proprietor, Annie Delisle, was novelist Cormac McCarthy's ex-wife), Old City Mercantile, Kerby's Antiques, and Hewgley's Music. Sullivan's Saloon \\"reopened\\" as Patrick Sullivan's Steakhouse and Saloon on St. Patrick's Day in 1988. Economy South Central's 100 block Now considered the \\"club district\\" of Knoxville (currently no strip clubs), the Old City is generally made up of warehouses, buildings of light industrial use, and a small historically commercial strip along South Central Street.

It is called \\"The Daniel\\", and opened to tenants late in 2016. There are several loft apartments in the older buildings of the Old City, many located behind and above offices and stores. The Jackson Ateliers Building and Hewgley Park lofts have been residential locations for many years. The Jacksonian Condos, JFG Flats, and Fire Street Lofts, have been redeveloped more recently as upscale condominiums, some listing in excess of $600,000. The area tends to attract young single adults, who are sometimes affiliated with the University of Tennessee, which is less than two miles away. The Old City's proximity to entertainment and nightlife make it an attractive place to live for many young adults.

The project features a flexible, portable, lightweight and open architecture for supporting QoS related services on the top of a general- purpose operating system as Linux. The architecture is well founded on formal scheduling analysis and control theoretical results. A key feature of AQuoSA is the Resource Reservation layer that is capable of dynamically adapting the CPU allocation for QoS aware applications based on their run-time requirements. In order to provide such functionality, AQuoSA embeds a kernel- level CPU scheduler implementing a resource reservation mechanism for the CPU based on Earliest Deadline First (EDF). This gives the ability to the Linux kernel to realize (partially) temporal isolation among the tasks running within the system. AQuoSA is one of a few projects that provides real-time scheduling capabilities to unprivileged users on a multi-user system in a controlled way, by means of a properly designed access-control model.  Description  The architecture of the project may be summarized as follows: 200px = Patch to the Linux kernel = At the lowest level, a patch to the Linux kernel adds the ability to notify to dynamically loaded modules any relevant scheduling event. These have been identified in the creation or death of tasks, as well as the block and unblock events. This patch is minimally invasive, in that it consists of a few lines of code properly inserted mainly within the Linux scheduler code (sched.c). It has been called \\"Generic Scheduler Patch\\", because it potentially allows to implement any scheduling policy. = Resource Reservations = The Resource Reservations layer is composed of three components. The core component is a dynamically loadable kernel module that implements a Resource Reservations scheduling paradigm for the CPU, by exploiting functionality introduced into the Linux kernel through the Generic Scheduler Patch. Second, a user-level library (QRES library) allows an application to use the new scheduling policy through a complete and well-designed set of API calls. Essentially, these calls allow an application to ask the system to reserve a certain percentage of the CPU to their processes. Third, a kernel-level component (the Supervisor) mediates all requests made by the applications through the QRES library, so that the total sum of the requested CPU shares does not violate the schedulability condition of the scheduler (less than one, or slightly less than one, due to overhead). The supervisor behaviour is completely configurable by the system administrator, so that it is possible to specify, on a per-user/per-group basis, minimum guaranteed and maximum allowed values for the reservations made on the CPU. With AQuoSA, applications may use directly the Resource Reservation layer, which allows them to reserve a fraction of the CPU, so to run with the required scheduling guarantees. For example, a multimedia application may ask the operating system to run the application with the guarantee of being scheduled at least for Q milliseconds every P milliseconds, where Q and P depend on the nature of the application. When registering an application with the Resource Reservation layer, it is possible to specify a minimum guaranteed reservation that the system should always guarantee to the application. Based on the requests of minimum guaranteed reservations, the layer performs admission control, i.e. it allows a new application in only if, after the addition of it, the new set of running applications does not overcome the CPU saturation limit. = Adaptive Reservations = For typical multimedia application making use of high compression technologies, it may be quite difficult, impractical or inconvenient to run such applications with a fixed reservation on the CPU. In fact, the most efficient reservation that should be used may vary over time due to varying compression level that results in varying decompression time. Traditional real-time systems make use of WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis techniques in order to compute what is the maximum time an instance of, for example, a periodic task may execute on the CPU before blocking waiting for the next instance. Such analysis is very difficult in today's complex multimedia applications, especially when running on general-purpose hardware like standard PCs, where technologies like multi-level caches, CPU execution pipelines, on-bus buffers, multi-master buses, introduce many unpredictable variables in determining the time required for memory accesses. On such systems, it is much more convenient to tune a system design based on the average expected load of the application. Otherwise, the system may be significantly under-utilized during runtime. As already mentioned, for certain classes of multimedia applications, such as a video player, it is quite impossible to find an appropriate fixed value for the fraction of CPU required by the application at run-time, due to the heavy fluctuations of the load depending on the actual data that is being processed by the application. A fixed reservation based on the average requirements, or slightly greater than that, results in transient periods of poor quality during runtime (e.g. movie playback). On the other hand, a fixed reservation based on the maximum expected load results in an unneeded over-reservation of the CPU for most of the time, except the periods in which the load really approaches the maximum expected value. For these classes of applications, it is much more convenient to use the Adaptive Reservation techniques, like the ones provided by the Adaptive Reservation layer of AQuoSA, that performs a continuous on-line monitoring of the computational requirements of the application processes, so that it may dynamically adapt the reservation made on the CPU depending on the monitored data. The Adaptive Reservation layer exposes to applications an API for using a set of controllers which are of quite general use within a wide set of multimedia applications. = AQuoSA Access Control Model = Most real-time variations of Linux require users of real-time capabilities of the modified OS to have root privileges on the system. This is perfectly acceptable in an embedded system context. However, this is excessive for multi-user systems where real-time scheduling features are needed for multimedia applications or similar. Therefore, AQuoSA embeds a dedicated access-control model by which system administrators can: # define real-time scheduling quotas to individual users or groups, in terms of maximum values for the minimum guaranteed bandwidth that the OS can grant to individual users or groups as a whole; # control how the optional required bandwidth values, in excess to the minimum guaranteed figures, is distributed among competing users, in overload situations; # control the maximum scheduling overhead that can be imposed on the system as due to real-time reservations created by individual users or groups; for example, allowing to control what is the minimum period that can be specified in a real-time reservation. More details can be found in the paper on the topic published at RTAS 2008.

It is one of the five R√≠as Baixas. The R√≠a de Arousa estuary is the largest of the estuaries of Galicia. It is part of the Rias Baixas and is located between the estuary of Muros and Noia to the north and the FPontevedra estuary to the south. The peninsulas of Barbanza, in the province of A Coru√±a, and O Saln√©s, in the province of Pontevedra, are those who define their coasts on the north and south, respectively. R√≠a de Muros and Noia (es, gl) is located in north. It is the largest estuary, although not reaching the higher levels bathymetric, at 69 m maximum depth at the mouth. It has numerous islands and islets among which the island of Arousa, A Toxa, S√°lvora in the mouth and Cortegada at the entrance. The main rivers that flow to it are the Ulla river at its headwaters and the river Umia in the cove that forms the peninsula of O Grove with the coast of Cambados. The most important river towns are Ribeira, Pobra do Carami√±al, Rianxo and Boiro to the north, and Vilagarc√≠a de Arousa, Vilanova de Arousa, Cambados and O Grove to the south, and Arousa in the homonymous island. Zones The northern zone, corresponding to the province of A Coru√±a, is relatively steep, with the Serra da Barbanza near the coast. The beaches take a few metres depth from the shore, forming sand banks in the interior bays. The southern zone, corresponding to the province of Pontevedra, is a flood zone, where the river Umia ends. The characteristic of the coast is shallow, with extensive formation of sand banks, where many arenicolous bivalves are grown like cockles or clams. The most well-known banks of Sarrido belong to the delta of Umia river and Os Lombos do Ulla belonging to the homonymous river delta. This southern area is relatively flat up to the highlands of Mount Castrove, which separates it from the R√≠a de Pontevedra, and is characterized by small farm plots usually cultivated with vegetables (Padr√≥n peppers, tomato, lettuce and legumes) or grapevines. The grapevines in the O Saln√©s area is mostly white grape Saln√©s (varieties Albari√±o wine). There are also cultivated dark grapes for the production of red wine also known Barrantes. There are also pink grape cultivated with which Catalan wine is made.

The company was known as Watson & Son (X-Ray) Ltd. until the merger in the late 1960s with A. E. Dean and Co. of Croydon. Watson and Sons had originally manufactured microscopes and other optical instruments, but in the late 19th century had seen the opportunity of making X-Ray equipment. They became part of GEC in the very early part of the 20th century. The main business of the merged GEC Medical was the manufacture of X-Ray equipment, including X-Ray tubes which were made under licence from a US company called Machlett Laboratories. Other products were the high voltage supplies needed for X-Ray tubes, the tables for positioning patients and many other accessories besides. It also employed a fairly large number of people supplying spare parts and servicing the pieces of equipment that were sold by the company. In the late 1980s the company introduced the concept of using a higher than mains frequency in an X-Ray power supply. One of the last products made by the company before it closed was a mammography unit. Until closure GEC Medical had around 40% of the UK market for medical imaging devices.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging  GEC also funded some of the development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using resistive magnet technology. At the same time, EMI Medical who had introduced the CT Scanner some time before using the principle of Godfrey Hounsfield, for which he won the 1979 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, were developing MRI using cryogenic magnets - which gave a higher field strength. At the time the maximum field strength with a resistive magnet was about 0.1T. With a cryogenic magnet, 1.0 T was easily achieved. EMI Medical went bankrupt at around this time so their interests in MRI were bought by GEC. This was a major impetus for GEC's acquisition of Picker Corporation in 1981. The merged company as Picker International had the first MRI scanner approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the US market. However business in the following decade did not suit them, and despite winning an order for air- droppable X-Ray units for the US Army, they closed the factory at Wembley in 1990, along with other sites in Canada and Germany.

Early career Born in Hillsboro, Ohio, Hastings enlisted in the 145th Illinois Infantry Regiment in 1864 at 18 years old. He made his major league debut on May 6, for the Rockford Forest Citys of the National Association as the starting catcher and manager of the team. The team disbanded after the 1871 season and Hastings moved to the Cleveland Forest Citys for the campaign as a player-manager again. Rotating between catcher, second base and outfield, Hastings was batting .391 when the team folded on August 19. Hastings then moved to the Baltimore Canaries to finish out the season, primarily catching and hitting a respectable .306. Hastings remained with the Canaries for the season, batting .281 and rotating with two other players at the catching position as well as filling in as a fourth outfielder. He moved to the Hartford Dark Blues in , once again platooning at catcher and playing in the outfield when not behind the plate. Hastings had a good year, hitting .325 and leading the team in runs scored. Later career Hastings was on the move again for , joining the Chicago White Stockings. Hastings was the regular catcher for Chicago but his average fell to .254. White Stockings owner William Hulbert found Hastings expendable as he signed Deacon White from the Boston Red Stockings to replace him. Hastings caught on with the Louisville Grays for the season in the new National League. Hastings was the everyday center fielder for the Grays, and although leading the team in runs scored Hastings' average was only .258 and was looking for a new team again after the season. In , Hastings played for the Cincinnati Reds and was one of six players who caught five games or more. The job was Hastings to lose and he did, batting only .141 for the season, his last in the majors.

Skladany, the only 3-time first team All American punter in college history, made Big 10 history in 1973 when he became the first specialty player given a football scholarship in Big 10 football history. Skladany was considered by Street & Smith's and Parade to be the consensus number one high school kicker/punter in America in 1972. Skladany turned down scholarship offers from Michigan, Penn State and hometown Pittsburgh to sign with Woody Hayes and Ohio State. Skladany was a three-time All-American at The Ohio State University‚Äî(1974, 1975, 1976). Skladany, the Cleveland Browns #2 pick in 1977, made professional sports history when he held out the entire season in a contract dispute, becoming the first-ever NFL draft pick to hold out a full season. His rights were traded to the Detroit Lions after the 1977 season. Skladany was named first team All-Pro after the 1978 and 1981 seasons with Detroit, leading the NFL in punting average both years. He was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 1981 season. A back injury ended Skladany's career prematurely in 1983 while punting for the Philadelphia Eagles. Skladany comes from a football family of note.

After the local nationalist commanders in Xinjiang defected to the communist side, many nationalists loyal to Chiang Kai-shek refused to join the communists, and one detachment of these loyal nationalists decided to take the town of Yiwu (Uyghur: Ara T√ºr√ºk) to turn it into a guerrilla base in order to fight on until the eventual return of Chiang. The battle The 2nd Company of the 46th Regiment of the communist 16th Division with less than 100 men were stationed at the town of Yiwu, 200 km northeast of Hami, and over 700 nationalists under the nationalist Hami special envoy commissioner Yulbars Khan and the former nationalist county head Abdullah (ËâæÊãúÈÉΩÊãâ) of Hami planned to take the town in late March 1950. The nationalist attack on the town was launched according to schedule on March 29, 1950. The nationalists were confident in that the town could be taken within a little as three days and on the first day of the battle, the nationalists had succeeded in taking the northern and southern peaks next to the town, thus seriously threatened the enemy defenders within the town. Realizing the serious situation, the enemy defenders sent out four squads to retake both peaks, and thus solidified the defense of the town, threatening the nationalists instead. The nationalist attempts to take the two peaks back was met with disastrous failure after several dozens assaults were beaten back with heavy losses. Realizing the tactic must be changed in order to avoid further casualties and the two hilltops must be taken, the nationalists adjusted their tactic of small scale assaults to launch a coordinated large scale attacks on April 5, 1950. After the five-hour-long battle that lasted from 3:00 AM to 8:00 AM, the nationalist again suffered defeat with great loss due to favorable terrain the enemy defenders enjoyed. It was the last large scale attack the nationalists were able to muster and the defeat cost the nationalists so much that nothing on the similar scale could be repeated again in the battle. Due to the lack of communication and the closest communist force was more than 200 km away, it was not until early April 1950 did the closest enemy force learned that their comrades in the town of Yiwu (‰ºäÂêæ) was besieged, and sent out a token reinforcement, which was successfully stopped by the nationalists more than a dozen kilometers away from the town. Due to the lack of intelligence, the commander of the enemy reinforcement mistakenly believed that the town had fallen into the nationalist hands when the entire garrison was wiped out, and withdrew to Micheng (Ê≤ÅÂüé) on April 14, 1950. However, the enemy defending Yiwu (‰ºäÂêæ) was far from being wiped out, but instead, successfully beaten back seven nationalist assaults, badly mauling the attacking nationalist in the process by taking advantage of the favorable terrain. In the beginning of May 1950, the communist 16th Division learned that the 2nd Company of the 46th Regiment still had the town firmly in its hands, and thus immediately sent out two battalions for reinforcement. By May 7, 1950, the enemy reinforcement had taken the Black Hilltop (Hei Shan Tou, ÈªëÂ±±Â§¥), and surrounded the nationalists who besieged the town. Sandwiched between the enemy defending the town and the enemy reinforcement surrounding them, the fates of the trapped nationalists were sealed. Realizing it was all over, the nationalists collapsed and attempted to flee despite the fact there was nowhere to escape. The enemy defenders easily linked up with their reinforcement and completely annihilated the nationalists on the same day, and not a single nationalist was able to escape. For its successful defense of the town, Peng Dehuai, the communist defense minister awarded the 2nd Company of the 46th Regiment of the communist 16th Division the title Steel and Iron 2nd Company, while the deputy battalion commander, Hu Qingshan (ËÉ°ÈùíÂ±±) was awarded the title Combat Hero. Outcome The nationalist defeat was primarily due to Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs uncompromising doctrine of holding onto the land conquered at all costs, which was faithfully followed by the local nationalists, despite that it was simply impractical and impossible to hold on to the town. As it was becoming obviously clear that attacking nationalists were impossible to take the town, the nationalists refused to retreat, thus exhausting all of their available supplies. The lack of supplies, in turn, forced the nationalists to attempt to capture the town in order to capture more supplies, and thus the nationalists were locked in a dilemma they had created themselves, resulting in eventual total annihilation. For the communists, there was a special recipient of third class honor: it was not a soldier, but a military horse named Jujube Colored Horse (Êû£È™ùÈ©¨). During the battle, the supply line (especially for water) to the communists defending the northern peak 211 metres above the sea level was sealed off by the nationalist fire. A communist soldier named Wu Xiaoniu (Âê¥Â∞èÁâõ) of the 2nd Company was sent to take the horse to supply the isolated but crucial communist position. Once fired by the enemy, the soldier immediately lay down and took cover behind rocks, and amazingly, the horse did the same by following its master, the soldier. Due to the severe shortage of manpower, Wu Xiaoniu only performed the supply mission once and then was tasked with other duties, and the horse was instructed to perform the mission itself by Wu Xiaoniu first loading it up with supply, and then pointing toward the northern peak. Amazingly, during the forty-day battle, the horse completed every mission itself while dodging enemy fire. Due to its special contribution, not only it was awarded the third-class honor after the battle, it remained in the service until its natural death in November 1967, instead of being discharged when aged like all other military horses. The Jujube Colored Horse had a military burial at the foothill of the northern peak it helped to defend, and in August 1985, a marble monument was added to its tomb.

It was built in 1886 by the Nashua Manufacturing Company to regulate water flow from the mill yard. The company relied on waterflow to provide power to its mill. In 1987 the gatehouse was included in the Nashua Manufacturing Company Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The gatehouse in 2001.  Origin  The Nashua Manufacturing Company received a charter in the 1820s to make cloth and to trade near the Nashua River. Three miles from where the company's mills were being built, a dam was constructed at Mine Falls. A power canal was hand-dug under the supervision of James Baldwin. His idea was to change the course of the water from the river, through the guard gates, and into the canal. By the time the water reached the mills, it had enough velocity to turn the waterwheels under the building. The gatehouse was constructed in 1886 during the presidency of Grover Cleveland. At the time it was a state-of-the-art improvement over the smaller gates that once occupied the canal. A Lowell, Massachusetts contractor, L.F. Kittrege, hired men to build five new lift gates that would be protected by the brick walls of the gatehouse. The gatehouse, along with the dam and canal, is a part of the Nashua Manufacturing Company Historic District; they are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The gatehouse was built for practicality, not architectural refinement. Its interior contains the machinery that reflects the transition from hydro power to electric power.  Decline  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, construction of new commercial buildings came to a stop as the economy declined. With changing manufacturing practices, many textile companies in New England closed or relocated to the South, where non-union workers could be hired for less money. Nashua Manufacturing Company did not move, and finally closed in 1948.

Scrivener provides a management system for documents, notes and metadata. This allows the user to organize notes, concepts, research, and whole documents for easy access and reference (documents including rich text, images, PDF, audio, video, web pages, etc.). Scrivener offers templates for screenplays, fiction, and non-fiction manuscripts. After writing a text, the user may export it for final formatting to a standard word processor, screenwriting software, desktop publishing software, or TeX. Features Features include a corkboard, the ability to rearrange files by dragging-and-dropping virtual index cards on the corkboard, an outliner, a split screen mode that enables users to edit several documents at once, a full-screen mode, the ability to export text into multiple document formats (including popular e-book formats like EPUB and Mobipocket for Kindle, and markup languages such as Fountain, HTML, and MultiMarkdown), the ability to assign multiple keywords (and other metadata) to parts of a text and to sort the parts by keyword (such as characters, locations, themes, narrative lines, etc.), hyperlinks between parts of a text, and \\"snapshots\\" (the ability to save a copy of a particular document prior to any drastic changes). Scrivener allows photos, URLs, and multiple other file formats, to be dragged into its interface as well. Because of its breadth of interfaces and features, it has positioned itself not only as a word processor, but as a project management tool for writers, and includes many user-interface features that resemble Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE).

The gherkin-shaped skyscraper pictured is officially named 30 St Mary Axe. St Mary Axe was a medieval parish in the City of London whose name survives as that of the street which formerly occupied it. The Church of St Mary Axe was demolished in 1561 and its parish united with that of St Andrew Undershaft, which is situated on the corner of St Mary Axe and Leadenhall Street. The site of the former church is now occupied by Fitzwilliam House, a fact acknowledged by a blue plaque on the building's fa√ßade. Nearby parishes include the medieval Great St Helen's (1210) and St Ethelburga (14th century). The street name may derive from a combination of the church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and a neighbouring tavern which prominently displayed a sign with an image of an axe, or simply from the church name itself, which may have come from the axes used by the Worshipful Company of Skinners, who were patrons. The sign of an axe is reported to have been present over the east end of the church.John Strype, A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster, 1720, based on the original (1598) by John StowThe Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 193 (1853), p. 49 The street St Mary Axe is now most notable for the Baltic Exchange at No. 38, and the \\"Gherkin\\" at No. 30, a distinctively shaped skyscraper built on the site of the former buildings of the Baltic Exchange and the UK Chamber of Shipping (destroyed by an IRA bomb in 1992). The street originates as a turn off Houndsditch at its northern end, with traffic flowing one-way southbound, and it originates at its southern end as a turn off Leadenhall Street, with traffic flowing one-way northbound. Both one-way portions of St Mary Axe converge at Bevis Marks, where traffic is forced westward into Camomile Street. Number 70 St Mary Axe appears in several novels by the British author Tom Holt as the address of a firm of sorcerers headed by J. W. Wells. This is itself a reference to Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer. In the song \\"My Name Is John Wellington Wells\\", the lyric renders his address as \\"Number Seventy, Simmery Axe\\"; this reflects the fact that some Londoners pronounce the street's name as \\"S'M'ry Axe\\" rather than enunciating it fully. The Tom Holt novels and The Sorcerer were written before the current office building at 70 St Mary Axe was constructed.

He is currently a sports anchor/reporter at Raycom Media's Tucson News Now which is a shared-services agreement that involves Fox affiliate KMSB-TV and CBS affiliate KOLD-TV in Tucson, Arizona. David joined the Fox 11 Sports Force in July 2011 and transitioned to Tucson News Now when the SSA went into effect in February 2012. He anchors sports primarily during the Fox 11 Tucson Now News at Nine on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Prior to transitioning to television, Kelly served for two-plus seasons as an anchor for the University of Arizona Wildcats Radio Network. Kelly hosted the pre-game, halftime, and post-game shows during all Arizona Wildcats football and men's basketball broadcasts as well as served as a play- by-play announcer for the Arizona baseball and softball teams. Kelly spent three seasons (2005‚Äì2007) doing radio and TV play-by-play for the Memphis Redbirds of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He is the son of NFL Hall of Fame running back Leroy Kelly, who starred with the Cleveland Browns from 1964-1973. His uncle Pat Kelly played Major League Baseball for 15 seasons (1967‚Äì1981) with the Minnesota Twins, Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Cleveland Indians. Kelly began his career in August 1991 as Sports Director at KTIP-AM 1450 in Porterville, CA. The station at the time was owned by Oakland A's announcer Monte Moore. His first professional baseball experience came broadcasting games for the Class-A Visalia Oaks during the 1991 and 1992 seasons. He later moved to KGEO-AM 1230 in Bakersfield where he became the voice of the Bakersfield Dodgers. Kelly advanced to Double-A baseball in 1995 where he broadcast games for the Port City Roosters (Wilmington, North Carolina) for two seasons. He was a mainstay at 50000-watt clear channel powerhouse WTAM-AM 1100 in Cleveland from 1997-2005. He started in the news department as an overnight anchor/morning drive reporter. Eventually moving to sports as an update anchor, beat reporter for the Cleveland Browns, and talk show host. He has won five Associated Press first place awards for his work in radio, including being named Ohio's Best Sports Broadcaster in 2005. Kelly's baseball style is a mixture of old school and new school. He loves to interweave stories about players around his play- by-play call. His home run call is Goodnight Irene and when the bases are loaded it's a Graaaand Slaaaamma. If a player has a big RBI night, or drives in a lot of \\"ribs\\" (as Kelly refers to them), he's been known to offer that player a wet nap for his performance. Kelly has adopted Arch McDonald's famous phrase for a fastball right down the middle of the plate, \\"right down Broadway\\", and changes it to fit a popular boulevard in whatever city he is currently calling games. Some of those streets that fastballs have whizzed down along the way have included Truxtun (Bakersfield), Oleander (Wilmington), Beale Street (Memphis), and Speedway (Tucson). Kelly attended University High School (Normal), Illinois (1986) and graduated from the University of Southern California in 1990.

Background and education Spencer-Stanhope was born Stanhope, only surviving son of Walter Stanhope, one-time merchant of Leeds, and his second wife Ann Spencer, daughter of William Spencer of Cannon Hall. Church records show that he was born on 4 February 1749 (Old Style, corrected now to 1750) and baptized on 9 March of the same year. He was educated at Bradford Grammar School and went up to University College, Oxford, and later studied law at the Middle Temple, London. In 1775, Stanhope inherited Cannon Hall from his uncle, John Spencer, and changed his name from Stanhope to Spencer-Stanhope by Royal licence. Political career Spencer-Stanhope was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Carlisle in 1775, Haslemere in 1780, Hull, Yorkshire in 1784, for Cockermouth in 1800, and for Carlisle, Cumberland in 1802. He was a close supporter of William Pitt the Younger and friend of William Wilberforce, the anti-slavery campaigner, after meeting whom he became a religious philanthropist. Business career As well as their interests in establishing the cotton industry in the late seventeenth century, the Spencer family were largely responsible for establishing the charcoal iron industry in the area between Leeds and Sheffield for the next 120 years. Family Spencer- Stanhope married Mary Winifred, daughter of Thomas Babington Pulleine, on 21 Oct 1783, in Tynemouth, Northumberland, England. They had eight sons and seven daughters. Their son John Spencer-Stanhope was a Fellow of the Royal Society and the father of Walter Spencer-Stanhope and John Roddam Spencer Stanhope. Spencer-Stanhope died at his house in Langham Place, London, on 10 April 1821 (after a long illness) and was buried at the parish church in Cawthorne, South Yorkshire, England. His wife died on 16 December 1850 and was buried with him. In a family record, she recorded the births of their 15 children\\"The letter- bag of Lady Elizabeth Spencer Stanhope\\", compiled by A.M.W.

St Martin Outwich was a parish church in the City of London, on the corner of Threadneedle Street and Bishopsgate. Of medieval origin, it was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century and demolished in 1874. Early history A church of St Martin was built in the 14th century at the expense of members of the Oteswich family, from whom the church derives its name. The church escaped the Great Fire of 1666, but fell into decay, and was badly damaged in a fire of 1765 which destroyed fifty houses. The medieval church had a nave and south aisle, with a western tower. The patronage was in the hands of the earls of Surrey and then of the Outeswich family, until it was transferred to the Merchant Taylors' Company. Rebuilding In 1796 an act of Parliament was obtained to allow the parish to raise money to rebuild the church. The Merchant Taylors gave ¬£500, and the Corporation of the City of London and the South Sea Company gave ¬£200 each towards the total cost of ¬£5, 256. The first stone was laid on 4 May of that year, and the new building, to the designs of Samuel Pepys Cockerell, was consecrated in November 1798. A new organ was provided by George Pike England in 1805. Cockerell's church was oval in plan, with a recess at the east end forming the chancel. The walls were decorated with pilasters, from the capitals of which rose a coved ceiling, pierced by four semi-circular windows. A fifth window, over the altar, contained stained glass coats-of-arms from the medieval church. Several monuments from the old church were also preserved, including one to John Outeswich and his wife. There was a fresco of the ascension by John Francis Rigaud over the altar, which had deteriorated badly within ten years of being painted. When the church was first built the pulpit was at the west end, with the pews facing away from the altar. The pulpit was moved to the west end as part of a programme of repairs and alterations by Charles Barry in 1827. The heavily rusticated east front, facing into Bishopsgate, was described by James Peller Malcolm as \\"a complete representation of a gaol, accompanied by marks of extreme strength, very ill suited to its diminutive outline.\\" The north side, towards Threadneedle Street, was very plain. Demolition thumbnail The church was demolished in 1874\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) and its parish united with that of St Helen's Bishopsgate. Eighteen monuments were moved into St Helen's before St Martin's was destroyed.. A churchyard in Camomile Street was given to the church in 1540. It survives as a garden in the courtyard of an office block.\\"London:the City Churches‚Äù Pevsner,N/Bradley,S New Haven, Yale, 1998 Proceeds from the sale of the church were used to fund the construction of Holy Trinity Church, Dalston, designed by Ewan Christian and constructed in 1878-9.

History The Alaguali were a Coast Miwok community of northern San Pablo Bay in the Tolay Creek region. Alaguali lands bordered the north edge of San Pablo Bay and the southern one third of their area was low tidal marshland at the mouth of Sonoma Creek and Napa Slough. Their strong marriage ties to the Petalumas suggest that the Alagualis held all of the valley of Tolay Creek to the north of Sears Point up to the Sonoma Valley airport, consisting of about 56 square miles. In 1814 the Spanish authorities began to split up the Alaguali amongst different missions, baptizing 91 at Mission Dolores and 37 at Mission San Jos√©. Padre Jos√© Altimira, the founder of Mission San Francisco Solano, wrote in his diary on June 27, 1823, \\"Tolay Lake so called for the Chief of the Indians\\". Tolay Creek was named for the lake. Watershed The Tolay Creek watershed lies between those of Sonoma Creek and the Petaluma River. It originates near Stage Gulch Road (part of State Route 116) about north of Lakeville, California. It feeds Tolay Lake, then descends to flow under State Route 121 north of the Infineon Raceway.

It is the largest statewide LGBT organization in the United States and the largest member of the Equality Federation. The organization is currently based in Los Angeles.  Structure  Equality California is an umbrella organization for the Equality California Institute, a 501(c)(3) organization that conducts public education programs for members of the LGBT community and the general public, as well as for healthcare workers, educators and public policymakers; and Equality California, a 501(c)(4) that maintains three political action committees (PACs), and, as of September 2016 has sponsored passage of more than 118 laws in the California Legislature expanding LGBT civil rights in the state. Leadership Equality California's leadership includes Executive Director Rick Zbur, and is supported by the separate boards of Equality California and Equality California Institute, as well as the Equality Council, a body of LGBT community leaders and allies. Zbur retired from his senior partnership with the law firm Latham & Watkins, where he was the first openly gay partner, to become Equality California's executive director.  History  = Recent history = When Zbur assumed the position of the organization's executive director in 2014, a rapid string of LGBT civil rights victories made it clear that a victory in the two-decade struggle to win marriage equality appeared imminent and that the priorities of LGBT organizations would have to evolve if they were to survive. In the summer of 2014, months before the historic 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, Zbur met with boardmembers to assess the organization, its priorities and its place in the LGBT civil rights landscape. The result was a broadly refocused mission designed to address the many, well-documented disparities in health and well- being that LGBT people suffer in comparison to the general population, especially the community's most marginalized members: people of color, the transgender community and LGBT undocumented immigrants. The organization divided its new mission and its programs into three areas: ending LGBT disparities in health and well-being, advancing the civil rights and acceptance of LGBT people and achieving a fair and just society for LGBT people and all the communities of which they are a part. That intersectional focus has led the organization to initiate programs and take positions on issues that have not traditionally been a focus of LGBT civil rights organizations, including filing an amicus brief in United States v. Texas, calling for the lifting of injunctions on presidential executive orders DACA and DAPA; condemning votes by members of California's congressional delegation to tighten restrictions on Syrian refugees attempting to enter the United States; and advocating for healthcare coverage for California's undocumented immigrants, as well as educating healthcare professionals in the state's Central Valley and Inland Empire regions about the special healthcare needs of LGBT and undocumented populations. = Early history = The California Alliance for Pride and Equality (CAPE) was founded in 1999, and the CAPE Foundation was launched in 2000 to expand education and outreach efforts. In 2003, the organizations became Equality California, the Equality California Institute and Equality California Political Action Committee. During that time, the organization grew exponentially under the leadership of Executive Director Geoffrey Kors. In 2004, Equality California merged with Marriage Equality California in order to better coordinate efforts to pass marriage equality legislation in California. From Marriage Equality USA, EQCA subsumed both the local grassroots organizing chapters of MECA throughout California, as well as hiring their volunteer leadership to become the field staff. The new consolidated programs became a co-branded joint project of EQCA and MECA under the direction of Molly McKay and Geoffrey Kors. For several years local chapters and staff worked as part of the joint project, until eventually the decision was made to drop joint branding and the program became the Equality California field team. In 2006, Equality California Institute launched \\"Let California Ring,\\" an educational campaign aimed at swaying public opinion on marriage equality. Let California Ring produced the well-received \\"Garden Wedding\\" ad, which aired only in the Santa Barbara media market as part of a study of the effect of various messages on public opinion. It was credited with an 11-point jump in support for marriage equality in the study area, and, in fact, Santa Barbara was the only county in Southern California to vote against Proposition 8 in 2008. Equality California was an organizational plaintiff in In re Marriage Cases, a consolidation of lawsuits filed by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Lambda Legal, several law firms and a number of individuals challenging California's marriage laws that excluded same-sex couples. The California Supreme Court on May 15, 2008 ruled that California same-sex couples had a right to marry under the California Constitution. Same-sex couples were able to marry as of June 17, 2008. Voters amended the state constitution to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying in November of that year with the passage of Proposition 8. Significant activities and programs: Equality California Los Angeles LGBT pride parade in 2011 =Legislation= As of the end of the 2016 legislative session, Equality California has sponsored and helped lobby for the passage of 118 bills advancing LGBT civil rights in the California Legislature. Some of the most significant include:  2005  * AB 849, the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act - AB 849, authored by then-California Assemblymember Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) and sponsored by Equality California, was the first time in U.S. history that a legislative body had approved a bill giving same-sex couples the right to marry. AB 849 was vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.  2011  * SB 48, the FAIR Education Act - SB 48, authored by Sen. Leno and sponsored by Equality California and GSA Network, expands groups included in California public school history and social sciences curricula to include the history of and contributions by LGBT people and people with disabilities. Guided by the law, the California Department of Education approved a new History-Social Science Framework in 2016.  2012  * SB 1172, Protecting LGBT Youth From Psychological Abuse - SB 1172, authored by State Sen. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) and sponsored by Equality California, NCLR, Lambda Legal and other groups, was the first law in the nation to ban the practice of so-called conversion therapy on minors. Backers of the practice quickly launched Pickup v. Brown and Welch v. Brown, lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the new law, which was upheld by the U.S 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013.  2013  * AB 1266, the School Success and Opportunity Act - AB 1266, authored by California Asm. Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco), protects the right of California K-12 public school students to use facilities and participate in programs consistent with their gender identity. Opponents mounted an effort to place an initiative on the ballot overturning the law but failed to collect the required signatures.  2014  * AB 1577, Respect After Death Act - AB 1577, authored by Asm. Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) and sponsored by Equality California and the Transgender Law Center, ensures that death certificates for transgender Californians accurately reflect their gender identity. * AB 2501, End Panic Defense - AB 2501, authored by Asm. Susan Bonilla (D-Concord) and sponsored by Equality California, eliminates the use so-called ‚Äúgay panic‚Äù and ‚Äútrans panic‚Äù defenses in criminal cases, in which defendants claim a type of temporary insanity due to a purported same-sex or transgender sexual advance. * AB 1951, Modernize Birth Certificates - AB 1951, authored by Asm. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles) and sponsored by Equality California, accommodates same-sex parents by allowing them to designate themselves as ‚Äúfather,‚Äù ‚Äúmother‚Äù or ‚Äúparent‚Äù on birth certificates. Previous birth certificate applications included lines reading only \\"father/parent\\" and \\"mother/parent.\\"  2015  * SB 703, Insurance Benefits for Transgender Employees - SB 703, authored by Sen. Mark Leno and sponsored by Equality California, NCLR and the Transgender Law Center, prohibits state agencies from doing business with companies not offering the same healthcare benefits to transgender employees that they offer all other workers. * SB 731: Supporting Transgender Foster Youth - SB 731, authored by Senator Mark Leno and sponsored by Equality California, NCLR and the Transgender Law Center, requires that a young person's gender identity be a consideration before that youth is placed in a foster care setting. * AB 329, California Healthy Youth Act - AB 329 was authored by Asm. Shirley Weber (D-San Diego) and sponsored by Equality California, the ACLU of California, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Forward Together and Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. It requires the inclusion of LGBT people and families in California public school sex education curricula. * AB 959, LGBT Data Collection - AB 959, authored by Asm. David Chiu (D-San Francisco) and sponsored by Equality California, requires government agencies to include LGBT people when they collect additional data on other groups, providing more accurate information for the allocation of state social services.  2016  * SB 1146, Uncovering Discrimination in Higher Education - SB 1146, authored by Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) and sponsored by Equality California, requires private colleges and universities affiliated with religious organizations to publicly disclose if they have obtained an exemption to state or federal nondiscrimination laws prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people. * SB 1408, HIV-Positive Organ and Tissue Donation - SB 1408, authored by Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) and sponsored by Equality California, AIDS Project Los Angeles, the Los Angeles LGBT Center and Positive Women's Network-USA, permits the donation of organs and tissue between HIV-positive donors and HIV-positive recipients. * AB 1887, State Government: Discrimination, Travel - AB 1887, authored by Asm. Evan Low (D-Silicon Valley) and sponsored by Equality California, prohibits state- funded travel by state employees to jurisdictions with new, anti-LGBT laws in place. AB 1887 passed in response to laws such as North Carolina's HB2 or Mississippi's HB 1523. * AB 2246, Pupil Suicide Prevention Poliicies - AB 2246, Authored by Asm. Patrick O'Donnell (D-Long Beach) and sponsored by Equality California and the Trevor Project, requires California public school districts serving grades 7-12 to adopt a suicide-prevention policy, with a special focus on groups at especially high risk for suicide, such as LGBT teens. The law also requires the California Department of Education to develop and maintain a model suicide prevention policy. = Equality California PACs =  Candidates PAC  The stated purpose of Equality California's Candidate PAC is to \\"achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Californians by supporting candidates who share the goals and objectives of Equality California and opposing candidates who do not \\" by working to elect openly LGBT and pro-LGBT candidates to state and local office across California. At the state level, the organization endorses LGBT and allied candidates with a 100-percent record of supporting LGBT issues, and, in the case of incumbent legislative candidates, a history of scoring 100 percent on Equality California's \\"Equality Scorecard.\\" In September 2016, that requirement of 100-percent support led Equality California to take the unusual step of revoking its endorsement of six state legislators, following their abstentions or opposition in a key vote on SB 1146. The organization also endorses openly LGBT candidates at the local level.  Federal PAC  Equality California's Federal PAC works to elect LGBT and pro-LGBT candidates to congressional office and the White House through endorsements and direct advocacy. In March 2015 EQCA announced its endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president, making it the first LGBT-rights group to endorse Clinton's then- anticipated candidacy.  Issues PAC  Equality California takes positions on selected ballot initiatives that either directly impact LGBT people, the communities of which they are a part, or have a bearing on broader social justice issues. The organization issues \\"support\\" or \\"oppose\\" recommendations on initiatives to its members in advance of elections, and has been a lead member of coalitions to defeat several ballot measures, including Proposition 8 and against a failed drive to place a measure on the ballot to overturn AB 1266. = Other advocacy = * Gun Safety - Following the June 12, 2016 shooting rampage at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Equality California became one of the first LGBT civil rights organizations to make combating gun violence a key part of its mission. Citing a long history of hate crimes against LGBT people‚Äîespecially transgender women‚Äîand a spike in LGBT homicides, the organization declared that \\"gun safety is an LGBT priority.\\" At a news conference with state and local Los Angeles officials less than a week after the shootings, Equality California announced its \\"#SafeAndEqual\\" initiative for stricter gun safety measures, and its support for a number of firearms-related bills then making their way through the California Legislature . Zbur said the group would \\"aggressively lobby\\" for those and other state and federal measures. In August 2016 Equality California announced its endorsement of California Proposition 63, a measure on the November ballot seeking to ban possession of high-capacity ammunition magazines and require background checks for the purchase of ammunition. * Budget Advocacy - Equality California works with state legislators and other officials to advocate for funding for state programs for LGBT homeless youth as part of state budget negotiations. * Federal Advocacy - Equality California works with members of California's congressional delegation and other federal officials to pressure the Food and Drug Administration to end its rules barring blood donation by gay and bisexual men, to advocate for passage of the federal Equality Act, and more. In early 2017, the organization announced that it had hired its first Washington, D.C.-based national policy director as a response to the \\"unprecedented\\" threat to LGBT rights presented by the incoming administration of Donald Trump. = Significant activities and programs: Equality California Institute = As part of the mission adopted in 2014, Equality California Institute initiated a number of new programs to educate LGBT people and the public at large about issues impacting the LGBT community and the communities of which LGBT people are also a part. Those program areas include: * lmmigrants - Identifying LGBT undocumented immigrants as some of the community's most vulnerable, Equality California Institute leads \\"Equality4All,\\" a statewide collaborative of LGBT and allied organizations focused on building LGBT community support for DACA, DAPA and comprehensive immigration reform. As part of its \\"Health Happens with Equality\\" initiative, the organization also conducts cultural competency trainings for healthcare workers about the special healthcare needs of LGBT and undocumented people. * Transgender Rights - In April, 2016, together with the Transgender Law Center, Equality California Institute co-founded Transform California. Transform California is a project of a statewide coalition of organizations focused on building public acceptance and understanding by educating Californians about transgender people and the challenges they face. * HIV - Equality California Institute is part of a coalition of HIV advocacy and civil rights organizations seeking to educate lawmakers and modernize California's laws that criminalize HIV transmission. The organization's \\"#TakeIt - I'm PrEP'd\\" campaign aims to educate the LGBT community about the availability and efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis therapy (PrEP), with a special focus on gay and bisexual men and transgender women of color. * Youth and Schools - In addition to Equality California's advocacy for legislation in the state capitol protecting LGBT students, Equality California Institute is developing a \\"Safe and Supportive Schools Index\\" that will provide a way to measure how effectively California schools are providing supportive environments for LGBT students and protecting them from bullying and harassment. The organization is also developing a series of cultural competency trainings for educators to better prepare them to identify and help at-risk LGBT students. * Leadership Development - Equality California Institute holds an annual Leadership Academy for rising LGBT leaders, as well as an annual summer fellowship in Sacramento for students together with support from the Comcast Foundation. * Outreach to Faith Leaders - In 2015, Equality California Institute merged with California Faith for Equality, a network of some 300 clergy members from various Christian, Jewish, Muslim and other congregations across California.

The school opened in Fall 2008 with the intention to relieve overcrowding of the two existing high schools, Huron High School and Pioneer High School. Skyline's first graduating class was in the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. History Skyline High School opened in Fall 2008 as the third primary high school and fifth total high school in the Ann Arbor Public Schools system. Construction on the new school began in April 2005 following the approval of a $240 million bond in June 2004. As construction was beginning, a population of Silvery Salamanders was found on the site. Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit to halt construction on the site due to the salamanders' presence. The lawsuit was dropped the following month and construction was allowed to continue. In wake of the salamanders' presence, 57 of the 109 acres of the school's property were set aside as a wildlife preserve. Academics Skyline differs from the other Ann Arbor high schools with its trimester system, mastery learning concept, and its four magnet programs. Unlike the other primary high schools, Pioneer and Huron, which are on traditional semesters, Skyline's school year is divided into three trimesters with a maximum of five classes per trimester. Skyline also implements a process known as mastery learning in its classes. The system requires students to receive at least an 80% on all unit tests and allows for extra studying and test re-takes should the student fail to achieve this benchmark. A large part of Skyline's academics is ingrained in its magnet programs. There are four programs that students can enter to focus a portion of their classes on a particular discipline. The magnets are: Health and Medicine, also known as H&M;, Design Technology, Engineering, and Prototyping, also known as DTEP, Communication, Media, and Public Policy, and Business, Marketing, and Information Technology, also known as BMIT. Each magnet program has specific classes open only to members of that magnet, which are required to be taken by students in the magnet. Students are given an overview of each magnet during their freshman year before they are allowed to apply to their magnet of choice later in the year. Magnet-specific classes begin during a student's sophomore year and continue until they graduate. During their senior year, students either complete a capstone project or work in an internship. Athletics Skyline High School is a member of the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA). They are part of the Southeastern Conference (\\"SEC\\") in the Red division. =Highlights= *On September 23, 2011 Skyline football quarterback Andrew Copp threw for a then-record 557 yards in a game against rival Ann Arbor Pioneer. *Skyline won its first state championship in 2013, as its boys' soccer team won the state championship.

The term STOLport did not appear to be in common usage as of 2008 although was commonly used by pilots flying into Biggin Hill during 1986/87 when the London City airport was opened restricting approaches and ceilings to the north of Biggin. A STOLport normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than . STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, and often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken. In the United States, short runway facilities are simply known as airports and the term STOLport has not been commonly used since the early 1970s.  North America  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines STOLports as \\"unique airports designed to serve airplanes that have exceptional short-field performance capabilities.\\"Stolport Manual (Doc 9150) International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) In the United States, a STOLport is one of several types of facilities. STOLports are identified with an S at the end of the site ID.FAA. Advisory Circular 150/5200-35 . Page 6. (PDF page 8) FAA SITE NR S = Stolport For example, Calvert Peak STOLport is listed as FAA site number 19448.1*S.OR73. As of January 2009, around 80 facilities are coded as STOLports by the FAA in the United States.FAA. Airport Data (5010) & Contact Information. The January 15, 2009 NFDC facility database listed 82 facilities as TYPE=STOLPORT. The NFDC runway database listed 2 runways as having \\"STOL\\" markings and 6 runways designated with an \\"S\\" meaning \\"STOL runway\\" According to the FAA in 1968, twenty-five potential STOLport sites were identified in the Northeast Megalopolis. In the early 1970s, a study was conducted to help the FAA to determine if it was necessary to create an elevated STOLport test facility.Elevated STOLport Test Facility Conceptual Development and Cost Study. April 1973. At one point in 1968, a STOLport was under consideration for a roof top in Manhattan.DECISION HELD UP ON SHIP TERMINAL; Council Unit Asks Agencies for Additional Data The New York Times. December 13, 1968 Toronto City Airport, with a longest runway of , went into a period of decline in the 1980s and 1990s, but has since been revitalized as a city centre airport by Porter Airlines, flying de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 Q400 turboprops. However, it is not officially designated as a STOLport.  Scotland  In the islands of Scotland there are some airports with very short runways, but still having scheduled flights. Examples include Colonsay Airport (1,644 ft /501 m), Foula Airfield (1,252 ft / 382 m) and Westray Airport (1,729 ft / 527 m). They are usually serviced by Britten-Norman Islander aircraft.  Norway and Greenland  Between 1965 and 1987, approximately 30 regional airports were built in Norway, typically equipped with a runway. They were intended to improve transportation systems and shorten travel times to areas that were considered difficult to reach by other means.Excerpt from history of Avinor (Norwegian) . Accessed May 21, 2010. In Norwegian, they are called \\"kortbaneflyplass\\" (\\"short runway airport\\"). As they were built in areas with relatively low population density and terrain that often wouldn't permit a standard length runway, it became essential to build shorter runways and use smaller airplanes. Today, the airports are frequented by airliners that have been awarded subsidies from the Norwegian government. They typically fly feeder routes to larger hub airports that have direct routes to Oslo and other major cities in Norway. Though most of the routes are flown by Wider√∏e, other airliners occasionally win bids on some of the routes. 950 meter runway at Nuuk Based on the Norwegian example, several short runway airports (800‚Äì900 meters) were built in Greenland, replacing heliports. The country at that time only had a few airports, built by the US defense in hidden locations far from Greenlandic settlements. Still the short runway airports (including at the capital Nuuk) can't accept flights from distant places like Denmark or the UK. Some of the airports of Iceland are STOLports, although most are longer. The availability of STOL aircraft has enabled Air Iceland to extend its network to Greenland. Avinor, the Norwegian airport authority worries about the future availability of aircraft for runway, in future when older aircraft currently used retires. Currently, DHC-8-100 aircraft, manufactured in the early 1990s, are used. Avinor has found that after 2010, no new aircraft can be bought which has more than 20 seats and is able to use such short runways. For this reason there are plans to extend runways to or in some cases to build new airports, and to close some combined with road improvements.Avinor vil legge ned fire flyplasser (in Norwegian) The least used will not be extended, but will have to be flown with very small aircraft. Also in Greenland this is discussed for the same reason. Greenland has decided to extend Nuuk and Ilulissat airports to jet aircraft size, . Rising fuel prices makes low drag a desirable feature, so STOL aircraft might be less desirable or numerous in future.  Historical STOLports  Several attempts were undertaken at the late 1960s and early 1970s to create STOLports in the United States for the New York City and Los Angeles, California areas; however, most are not operational or no longer in existence at the present time. There was also Victoria STOLport in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The first US STOLport for commercial operation was commissioned August 5, 1968, at La Guardia airport and was available for VFR use only.FAA Chronology . Accessed August 26, 2008. This STOL runway was dubbed the LaGuardia STOLPORT.Starting STOL Time. Aug. 16, 1968. The first officially designated STOLport in the U.S. opened on October 17, 1971, at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Shawnee Airlines operated scheduled passenger service between the Walt Disney World Airport (DWS, also known as the Lake Buena Vista STOLport) and Orlando McCoy Jetport (MCO, now the Orlando International Airport) as well as the Tampa International Airport (TPA) with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop STOL aircraft.The short, short life of Disney World's STOLport.

Prior to that date, only portions of facilities were designated STOLports. Plans at the time called for an interstate STOL transportation system. On July 26, 1972; the FAA V/STOL office was renamed to the Quiet Short-Haul Air Transportation System Office refocusing it and reflecting public concerns about noise created by smaller more numerous STOLports as opposed to larger airports. The Quiet Short-Haul Air Transportation System Office was eliminated June 11, 1974.

Flight International. October 17, 1968. Some STOLports were never open to public aviation and were privately owned, such as the Avon STOLPort,http://www.airfields- freeman.com/CO/Airfields_CO_NW.htm a runway located adjacent to the town of Avon, Colorado that was constructed specifically to handle tourist flights for nearby ski resorts in the Vail area. The Avon STOLPort was owned and operated by Rocky Mountain Airways which operated de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 STOL turboprops from this mountain airfield. The Avon STOLport is no longer in existence. Another privately owned STOL airfield was the Clear Lake City STOLport (CLC) located in the Houston, Texas area near the NASA Johnson Space Center. This small airport which included a runway, an aircraft hangar, and a passenger terminal was constructed in 1969 and owned by Houston Metro Airlines which later changed its name to Metro Airlines. The airline operated Twin Otters from this suburban airfield with shuttle service to Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH).

Shatto also served as the Argonauts general manager after his playing days with the club ended. Shatto's playing career with the Argos lasted twelve seasons, from 1954 to 1965. His #22 jersey is one of only four that has been retired by the club. Shatto was one of the most productive players in the CFL and for a team that made the playoffs only three times during his career: 1955, 1960, and 1961. During Shatto's playing tenure with the club, the Argos finished last in their conference eight times. Dick Shatto was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.  College football career  Shatto played collegiately for the University of Kentucky Wildcats. Following college, Shatto was drafted in the 15th round of the 1956 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams.  Professional football career  Shatto held the record for most career touchdowns with 91, of which 39 were rushing and 52 were receiving; his 91 career touchdowns is the eighth highest in league history. Shatto was the all-time leader for the most combined (rushing and receiving) yardage with 13,642 yards that came on 1322 carries and 466 receptions. Presently he still ranks in seventh place, and he is still third among running backs, passed only by George Reed and Mike Pringle. His most productive season was 1960 when he carried the ball 122 times for 708 yards with a touchdown and caught 53 passes for 894 yards with ten more majors for a total yards from scrimmage of 1,602. When it comes to total yardage, that also includes return yardage from punts, kickoffs and missed field goals, as well as yards from scrimmage, Shatto accumulated a total of 15,725 yards. That put him second all-time in 1965 and since then he has dropped to only seventh place. Shatto never surpassed 1,000 yards in a season either rushing or receiving. However, he averaged 1,136 yards per season in yards from scrimmage. His best seasons in running the ball came in 1958 and 1959 when he tallied 969 and 950 yards respectively. The former was a team record at the time according to official statistics. Also he never led the CFL or the Eastern Conference in rushing yards. Shatto's 6,958 rushing yards remains to this day an Argonaut team record and at the end of his career he was sixth all-time. He provided the Argos with 16 100-yard rushing games. As a receiver Shatto accumulated 6,684 yards and his best season came in 1963 with 67 receptions for 945 yards and ten touchdowns. When he left the game he was the number two all-time receiver. He led the Eastern Conference in receptions in 1962 (47), 1963 (67) and 1964 (53). Shatto was the Argos' nominee for the Most Outstanding Player Award in 1955, 1957‚Äì59, and 1962‚Äì64 and was the league's runner-up in 1955, 1958 and 1964. Plus he was an Eastern All-Star from 1956‚Äì1959 and 1961-64. He was named to the league's all-star squad (not started until 1962) in 1963 and 1964. Following press rumours of a possible trade to Montreal, on September 17, 1965, Shatto announced his decision to retire at the end of the 1965 CFL season. Toronto mayor Philip Givens declared October 16, 1965, the date of Shatto's last home game with the Argonauts, \\"Dick Shatto Day\\" in Toronto, and, at the player's request, the club donated the proceeds of the game to the building fund of the Hospital for Sick Children. Shatto was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1975.  Colour commentator and Argonauts general manager  From 1970-1973, Shatto was a colour commentator for the CFL on CTV. In 1976, Shatto became general manager of the Argonauts. The Argonauts went 17-30-1 in Shatto's three seasons as general manager, making the playoffs once.

(The church that remains in the modern-day St Mary Axe is St Andrew Undershaft.) Its full name was St Mary, St Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins, and it was also sometimes referred to as St Mary Pellipar. Its common name (also St Mary [or Marie] at the Axe) derives from the sign of an axe over the east end of the church. The church's patrons were the Skinners' Company.John Strype, A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster, 1720, based on the original (1598) by John StowThe Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 193 (1853), p. 49 According to John Stow in A Survey of London (1603), the name derived from \\"the signe of an Axe, over against the East end thereof\\". However, a document dated to the early reign of King Henry VIII describes a holy relic held in the church; \\"An axe, one of the two that the eleven thousand Virgins were beheaded with\\".Wheatley, Henry Benjamin and Cunningham, Peter (2011) London Past and Present: Its History, Associations, and Traditions, Cambridge University Press (p. 493) This refers to the legend that Saint Ursula, when returning to Britain from a pilgrimage to Rome accompanied by eleven thousand handmaidens, had refused to marry a Hunnish chief and was executed along with her whole entourage on the site of modern Cologne, in about 451 AD. It was situated just north of Leadenhall Street on a site now occupied by Fitzwilliam House. First mentioned as St Mary apud Ax,\\"A Dictionary of London\\" Harben, H: London, Herbert Jenkins, 1918 it belonged for a time to the nearby Priory of St Helens. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was still extant but in decline, and in 1562 it was offered to Spanish Protestant refugees as a place of worship.‚ÄúThe Old Churches of London‚Äù, Cobb, G: London, Batsford, 1942 Three years later, however, it was unused and in a state of disrepair. Shortly afterwards it was pulled down and its parish was united with that of the neighbouring St Andrew Undershaft. The church gave its name to a street of the same name, which links Leadenhall Street with Camomile Street and Houndsditch. No. 30 was the location of the Baltic Exchange until it was destroyed by an IRA bomb in 1992; the Exchange is now located at No. 38 just to the north of its former address. On the site of the old Baltic Exchange now stands 30 St Mary Axe, a skyscraper known colloquially as the Gherkin because of its distinctive shape.\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) The street of St Mary Axe was also the location of the sorcerer's shop in Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta The Sorcerer, which documents the former pronunciation \\"Simmery Axe\\".

It was written by Kenny Young and Ben Yardley. The song is unusual in its atmospheric use of sound effects (foghorn, ship's bell, Morse code) and features psychedelic instrumentation and treatments including electric sitar, backwards piano, filtered vocals and phasing. Lead singer Mary Aiese O'Leary told Mojo magazine in May 2008, \\"I thought it was horrible ‚Äî the foghorn, the way they had changed my voice with effects. But I grew to like it, and it afforded the opportunity to go over to London ... In America, it fizzled. People in England liked quirkier stuff, and 'Captain of Your Ship' was quirky.\\" As O'Leary suggests, the song only made #127 in the U.S. national charts, but it became the group's biggest hit when it made #13 in the UK Singles Chart,. Following the success of the single, the group toured the United Kingdom, with the backing group Clouds. Young said of this period: \\"I accompanied them to Top of the Pops ...[and]...attended the reception for their hit single \\"Captain of Your Ship\\", along with John Lennon and Ringo at the Revolution Club in London. I met half the Beatles at our own reception...\\" Some sources wrongly credit Lorraine Mazzola with the lead vocal on the recording of \\"Captain of Your Ship\\". However a filmed live performance from German television, widely available on video sharing websites, shows Mary Aiese singing lead. The confusion may have arisen because Mazzola did become lead singer of the live group the following year, when Mary Aiese took a break from performing live. The filmed performance, with an introduction in German by Dave Lee Travis, appears to be the only existing archive television footage of the group from their 1960s heyday.

Personal life Scholdan was born in Vienna. He moved to the United States in 1938. In 1946, he married a figure skater, Roberta Jenks, with whom he had two children, Ruth and Jimmy, and a stepdaughter, Dixie Lee. Career Scholdan represented Austria as a competitor at the 1933 World Championships. However, he became better known as a coach; he worked at the Broadmoor Skating Club in Colorado Springs, Colorado beginning in 1945. His students included: * Eva Pawlik, the 1948 Olympic silver medalist * Hayes Alan Jenkins, the 1956 Olympic champion * David Jenkins, the 1960 Olympic champion * James Grogan, 1952 Olympic bronze medalist * Ina Bauer * Karol Kennedy / Peter Kennedy, the 1950 World pairs champions * Ronnie Robertson, the 1955 World silver medalist In 1961, Scholdan and his 13-year-old son were among those killed in the crash of Sabena Flight 548, which was carrying the entire U.S. Figure Skating team to the 1961 World Championships. Aged 50 at the time of his death, he was travelling as the coach of Gregory Kelley, Stephanie Westerfeld, and Bill Hickox and Laurie Hickox. Scholdan had planned to take his son to Vienna and other places in Europe following the competition. The Professional Skaters Association's annual awards are called \\"EDI awards\\" in Scholdan's honor. Scholdan was president of that organization from 1950 to 1954 and was inducted into the inaugural class of their Coaches Hall of Fame in 2001.

Description The apparatus consists of a substantial table with an array of menacing metal spikes suspended above it. The basic premise is that the performer will be restrained on the table and must escape before the spikes are released and allowed to fall. A curtain is drawn around the apparatus to obscure the performer from view while he or she attempts the escape. The sequence of events is arranged so that it initially appears the spikes fall before the performer has had time to get out from under them; however, the curtain is then pulled back to reveal the performer free and unharmed. Sometimes a scrim is used instead of a curtain and, with back lighting, it is arranged that the audience see the silhouetted shadow of the performer struggling to escape before the spikes fall. The exact design varies slightly from one example to another but the basic arrangement remains constant. The spikes are supported from a frame attached to the table, which also serves to guide them as they are raised and dropped. There is generally some form of pulley or winch mechanism to raise the spikes, which are genuine and heavy. The table itself generally has an array of holes that match the layout of the spikes, so that the spikes protrude through the table when they drop. The performer lies on his or her back on the table and is restrained with a variety of chains, cuffs and manacles. One significant way in which different versions vary is in the arrangement for releasing the spikes for their lethal drop. This depends on the story that is built around the trick as part of the performance. Sometimes it is presented as having a timing device automatically release the spikes, while other performers have their assistants appear to cut through a securing cable or merely let go of the cable at the appropriate moment. In many performances, the rope which supports the spikes in their raised position is set alight, releasing the spikes when it has apparently burned through to the point where it no longer has the strength to support the weight of the spikes. History The modern incarnation of the trick is widely credited to magician Andr√© Kole. However, there are also references to it having first appeared in the 1930s. At least one source credits it to \\"W. Jeans, A Zagorsky & Andre Kole\\". This might be a reference to Walter Jeans (1877‚Äì1942) who created a trick called the \\"Death of Coira\\", which has been described as a forerunner of the Table of Death. The Table of Death was one of the tricks for which a method was supposedly revealed in the Fox network's Masked Magician series. This occurred despite a lawsuit brought by Andr√© Kole against the show's makers in an effort to stop them. The show failed to reveal a number of features and methods that are used in contemporary versions of the trick, including methods for escaping from restraints and the method for showing the performer's silhouette on a scrim. Performers The following magicians and escape artists are known to have performed this trick: * Andr√© Kole * Doug Henning * Ariann Black * Chris Korn (in season 1 of The Magicians) * David Copperfield * Jay Owenhouse * Joe Labero * Morgan the Escapist * John Hirokawa * Mark Kalin * Penn & Teller (one method for this trick is exposed in their movie Penn & Teller Get Killed ) * Sittah * Stephen Mulhern * John T.

She became nationally known as the victim of murder by her husband, Stephen Grant, in February 2007. The case gained widespread coverage in Michigan and nationally because her husband fled while the police were searching their house, had dismembered her body, and made a confession to police that was released in April 2007 before the trial later that year. Stephen Grant was convicted in December 2007 of premeditated homicide and mutilation, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Both the conviction and sentence were upheld through appeals. Background Tara Lynn Grant was born in Michigan in June 1972. She had a sister Alicia, and they attended public schools. Tara Lynn graduated from Michigan State University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in business. She soon started working for the Washington Group International. Her job required her to travel frequently for business but she had a rising career at the Boise-based company, which had offices around the world. (In November 2007 the company was acquired by URS Corporation of San Francisco.) She married Stephen Grant, also of Macomb County, Michigan, and they had two young children by 2007, a girl, 6, and a boy, 4. By 2007 she was the principal wage earner and he cared for the children, while also working in a tool and die shop. The household also included Verena Dierkes, a 19-year-old au pair from Germany. Tara disappears On February 14, 2007, Valentine's Day, Stephen Grant called the Macomb County Sheriff's Office in the county seat, Mount Clemens, Michigan, to report that his wife, Tara Lynn Grant, had been missing for five days. In his account, Grant said that this was not the first time his 34-year-old wife had left home, which was why he had not immediately reported her missing. He said that on the evening of February 9, he had overheard Tara talking with someone on the phone, saying, \\"I'll meet you at the end of the driveway\\". He said he saw her get into a dark-colored car that drove off, and that he had not seen or heard from her since. Over the following two weeks, Stephen Grant made numerous media appearances, at times accusing authorities of harassment. The day after reporting Tara missing, Grant was stopped by police and arrested for driving with a suspended license. He accused police of using the traffic arrest as an excuse to take him into custody to question him further about Tara's disappearance. Police denied the accusation. They were holding daily press conferences during the search for Tara. According to police, Stephen Grant was less than cooperative with them during their early investigation. He initially refused to answer questions but agreed to take a polygraph test, if it was administered by someone other than the police. On March 2, 2007, police executed a search warrant at the home of Stephen and Tara Grant in Washington Township, Michigan. They found a dismembered human torso, believed to be that of Tara Grant, stored in a plastic garbage bag in the garage. They immediately gained an \\"open murder\\" arrest warrant for Stephen Grant, who had already fled the scene. They had not yet determined the degree of the charges. Two days later, after tracking a cell phone call that Stephen made to his sister, Griem, police found the suspect 225 miles away in northern Michigan's Wilderness State Park. He had taken liquor and pills from his sister's house, intending to commit suicide. After driving to the park, he spent the night in the freezing cold, with no outer clothing for protection. After being taken into custody, he was airlifted by helicopter to Northern Michigan Hospital in Flint for treatment of hypothermia. In a press conference on March 5, Mark Hackel, Sheriff of Macomb County, discussed a confession that Grant had made to them in the hospital. He confessed to police in detail about strangling his wife Tara to death on the night of February 9, after an argument in which he had accused her of spending too much time with a co-worker. She had returned that day from a business trip to Puerto Rico. Their two children were at home but were asleep in bed. Grant later dismembered her body at his father's tool and die shop, USG Babbitt. He took the remains to nearby Stony Creek Metro Park in Shelby Township and disposed of body parts there. But after learning the police planned to search the park, Grant recovered the torso of his wife, and hid these remains in black plastic garbage bags in their garage. After being released from the hospital, Grant was transported to Macomb County by a convoy of Macomb County Sheriff's deputies. On March 6, 2007 Grant was formally charged with count one homicide: murder in the first degree that is premeditated, and with count two disinterment and/or mutilation of a dead body. The charge of count one homicide in the first degree that is premeditated is punishable by life in prison. The charge of disinterment, dismemberment, is punishable by up to 10 years in prison or a $5,000 fine or both. On April 13, 2007, the Macomb County Prosecutor released Stephen Grant's two-part confession publicly, a transcript of the interview with detectives and his own handwritten confession. Details included his arguing with his wife over his jealousy about her spending time with a co-worker. He also said he had been having an affair with Verena Dierkes, the family's 19-year-old au pair from Germany. As the argument escalated, Grant strangled Tara in anger. He also described his efforts to dismember her body and hide it, after he had notified the police of her disappearance. Media coverage Tara Grant's murder gained nationwide media coverage. During the search, the Macomb County Sheriff's Department held a daily press conference until they found her body. Grant's escape into the wilderness also captured their attention. After Stephen Grant was arrested, and had confessed the details of his crimes, Larry King Live and Court TV both covered the homicide and investigation. Verdict On Friday, December 21, 2007, Stephen Grant was found guilty on the charge of murder in the second degree. On Thursday, February 21, 2008, he was sentenced to a minimum of fifty years in prison. On March 30, 2010, Grant lost his final appeal in state court, leaving intact the original sentence of 50‚Äì80 years. The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed a lower court decision that found Grant's trial was not unduly prejudiced by pretrial publicity in the widely covered case, nor was Grant improperly denied access to an attorney before making a confession to police. In March 2015, U.S. District Court Judge David Lawson denied Grant's \\"petition for writ of habeas corpus.\\" Grant had claimed that police improperly obtained his confession while he was being treated in a hospital for hypothermia and exposure; the judge also denied that pre-trial publicity made it impossible for him to receive a fair trial. Lawson said that officials in Macomb County took \\"extraordinary measures\\" to ensure that a fair and impartial jury was seated. Aftermath and representation in other media Tara's family have said that they will allow her two children to read their father's confession after they reach adulthood. Tara Grant's sister Alicia Standerfer was authorized by the court to represent Tara's estate. She filed a wrongful death civil suit against Stephen Grant. Standerfer and her husband Eric are rearing the two young Grant children at their home in Ohio. On June 13, 2008, Stephen's father, William Allen \\"Al\\" Grant, committed suicide in Capac, Michigan, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He died at Port Huron Hospital. A man who had a neighboring tool shop said that William Grant never seemed to recover from the actions of his son and destruction of the family. Al Grant had been married three times, and widowed twice. He was survived by a married daughter and her husband, in addition to the two Grant children. Since Stephen Grant's conviction and sentencing, at least two books have been published about the case: A Slaying in the Suburbs: The Tara Grant Murder (2009), by Andrea Billups and Steve Miller, includes interviews with Stephen Grant recorded at Michigan's Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility. Limb From Limb (2009) was written by Detroit News crime reporter George Hunter, who covered the case from the beginning, and former Detroit News editor Melissa Preddy. Several TV series featured this case: the Biography Channel had it as an episode in the Casanova Killers series, Season 1, Episode 3. The Investigation Discovery series Scorned: Love Kills featured \\"The Au Pair Affair\\" as Season 1, Episode 8, aired March 2012. The series Betrayed ran the episode \\"Beware The Au Pair\\" in April 2019.

It is located northeast of Dickinson, North Dakota. It was closed in 1965.  History  Dickinson Air Force Station came into existence as part of Phase III of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. On October 20, 1953 ADC requested a third phase of twenty-five radar sites be constructed. It became active in April 1959. The 706th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron activated with AN/FPS-3 search and AN/FPS-6A height-finder radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. A second AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar was added in 1960. During 1961 Dickinson AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-20 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 706th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. By 1963 the radars had been upgraded to AN/FPS-66 search and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars, and on 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-177. In addition to the main facility, Dickinson operated three unmanned AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Glendive, MT (TM-177A) * Alexander, ND (TM-177B) * McIntosh, SD (TM-177C) All three Gap Filler sites remain with both the radar towers and support structures intact. The Alexander site is now home to the Watford City Joint Surveillance System (ARSR-4) LRR site (Z-300/J-76). Dickinson was removed from service on 1 March 1965. The 706th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated 25 June 1965. Today the station is abandoned, being demolished.  Buildings and facilities  Buildings on the station include: * Family Housing * Club and Gymnasium * Telephony Kiosk * Search Radar Tower * Height Finder Radar Tower * (3) Radomes * Heating Plant * Bachelor Officers Quarters (BOQ) * Barracks * Operations Building * Squadron Headquarters building * Administration building * Power building (also known as the \\"Diesel Building\\") One interesting fact about the main station is that the family housing area is approximately one mile west of the operations buildings. The Ground to Air Transmitter-Receiver (GATR) facility was located off-station at , approximately 2700' elevation AMSL, roughly 3 miles north of the main station.

The new Castell Rhuthun (Ruthin Castle) hotel; attached to the old castle. Ruthin Castle () is a medieval castle fortification in Wales, near the town of Ruthin in the Vale of Clwyd. It was constructed during the late 13th century by Dafydd ap Gruffydd, the brother of Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, on a red sandstone ridge overlooking the valley. Part of the ancient walls still remain and now form part of the Ruthin Castle Hotel. History Ruthin Castle occupies a site that was first used as an Iron Age fort. In 1277, Edward I of England granted the land to Dafydd ap Gruffydd in gratitude for his assistance during the invasion of North Wales. It is unclear whether there was an existing fort on the site or whether Dafydd established the castle. The castle was originally given the Welsh name of Castell Coch yn yr Gwernfor (Welsh Red Castle in the Great Marsh). The castle was most notably the base of that branch of the noble de Grey family accorded the title \\"Barons Grey de Ruthyn\\" and the head of their marcher lordship of Dyffryn Clwyd. It was a base for Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn ‚Äì the man who could be said to have sparked the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr. At the start of the English Civil War the castle was in a state of disrepair and the necessary works were hastily performed to make it defensible. It withstood an eleven- week siege by parliamentary troops in 1646 before surrendering when the attackers announced that they intended to lay mines under the walls. Oliver Cromwell's forces later dismantled and demolished the castle, in a process of organised de-fortification called slighting. In modern times In 1923 the castle became Britain's first private hospital for the investigation and treatment of obscure internal diseases but this was closed in about 1950. Since the 1960s the castle remains have been incorporated into a hotel. A notable guest was Prince Charles, who stayed here for the night before his investiture as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1969. The castle is said to be haunted, because of this reputation, it was investigated by the paranormal investigation show, Most Haunted, in 2018.

The band shared a strong and immediate connection with punk and rock music. The band coined their name while attending The Pop Disaster Tour featuring Blink 182 and Greenday. While attending high school the band began playing their first shows locally. Their high energy performances helped them cultivate a large and dedicated fan base throughout Southeast Texas. The band released numerous demos before signing to Chicago-based indie label TDR Records and releasing their first EP The Way We Operate in 2007 produced by Steve Soboslai. In support of their release the band set out on numerous self- booked tours across the US. After touring full-time for two years, founding member, Canaan Davis decided to leave the band to attend college. Now a trio, the band traveled to Baltimore, MD in August 2008 to work with producer Paul Leavitt (Circa Survive, The Bled, All Time Low). These recordings were titled the My Life With a Giant EP and were self-released by the band in June 2009. Prior to returning to Baltimore to complete their EP, Guitarist Stephen Salisbury joined the band, making his debut on the opening track \\"Tommy With The Lights Out.\\" Soon after its release, the EP appeared on the Billboard Heat Seekers chart for 5 weeks in a row (July - Aug. 2009). In March 2010 the band released their first music video for the song \\"Panic Attacks Are Normal\\" which was filmed in their hometown. The music video landed them a spot on the FriendsOrEnemies.com's \\"Unsigned VIPs Tour\\" featuring the bands Set It Off and With The Punches. The tour consisted of over 20 dates including the band's first trip to Canada. Wilder Child of a Thousand Suns (2011-2012) For the recording of Wilder Child of a Thousand Suns the band traveled to Lancaster, PA to begin tracking songs with engineer Kory Gable. The recording took place in two sessions and the album was completed in a total of only 8 days. The band chose to limit their time in the studio in order to create a spontaneous atmosphere. After tracking the record the band chose a photograph of Bradley's aunt and mother disguised as clowns, taken on Halloween 1979. The band chose a new approach with the release of this album. The band relocated to Los Angeles, CA and made the album available for free download on their website. In November 2012 the band embarked across the US on the Wilder Child of a Thousand Suns Tour performing the album in its entirety on select dates. 2013 - present Barely Blind was to enter the studio in May 2013 with Pierre de Reeder (Rilo Kiley, Death Cab For Cutie, Vampire Weekend) at Kingsize North in North Hollywood to begin tracking songs for their follow up to Wilder Child of a Thousand Suns.

Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid 1980s, the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school. There are currently 162 pupils on roll. Westbourne School opened its 6th form for the Autumn term of 2008. The school introduced the speciality of the Diploma Programme of the International Baccalaureate Organisation in 2008. The school is housed within two buildings, approximately half a mile apart. The first houses the Nursery and Prep, the other the senior school and sixth form.

However the school's foundation is deemed to be during the following year in 1896 under the headship of Mrs Caroline Ferris. Mrs Ferris renamed Ebenezer House as Westbourne House and the school was therefore retitled as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys. In 1901 the school relocated to the large corner property at 13 Stanwell Road, which still forms part of the current school building. =Expansion= In 1975 the adjoining property at 4 Hickman Road was also purchased and the combined properties were developed as Westbourne Senior School. The school opened a junior college for children aged between 9 and 11 years of age. It was decided to make the additional purchase of the struggling independent St Alma‚Äôs Girls School located in Victoria Road and, with the purchase, the combined school became coeducational. The school today The school in 2009 =Organisation= The Victoria Road facility now houses the Nursery and Prep School. The Senior School and Sixth Form are located in the main school building on the corner of Stanwell and Hickman roads. Entrance assessments and taster days are available throughout the year.

Plot At the beginning of the holiday season, a school administrator, Cal Peterson (Gerald McRaney), is sent to a financially troubled school to find a way to keep it from closing. After reviewing expenses, he decides that the best way to save money is to cancel the music program in which his niece Fern (Alison Pill) is enrolled and let go its teacher, Lily Waite (Naomi Judd). News of his decision leaks out prematurely, causing resentment among the students. After realizing how much the program has benefited his shy niece, he regrets his decision, but can think of no better alternative. In a subplot, with Peterson's help, a long- time lady friend secretly arranges a reunion of his father Jake Peterson's WWII squadron, as a Christmas present. He is so happy that he decides to propose. The film ends with a concert by the music department's students, where Peterson hears his niece perform and then announces that the townspeople have donated enough money to keep the program going.

Published in 1850, the year he was appointed Poet Laureate, it forms part of In Memoriam, Tennyson's elegy to Arthur Henry Hallam, his sister's fianc√© who died at the age of twenty-two. According to a story widely held in Waltham Abbey, and repeated on many websites (see two examples below), the 'wild bells' in question were the bells of the Abbey Church. According to the local story, Tennyson was staying at High Beach in the vicinity and heard the bells being rung on New Year's Eve. It is an accepted English custom to ring English Full circle bells to ring out the old year and ring in the new year over midnight on New Year's Eve. Sometimes the bells are rung half-muffled for the death of the old year, then the muffles are removed to ring without muffling to mark the birth of the new year. In some versions of the story it was a particularly stormy night and the bells were being swung by the wind rather than by ringers, but this is highly unlikely given the method of ringing English full circle bells, which requires a considerable swinging arc before the clappers will strike the bell. The poem :Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, :The flying cloud, the frosty light: :The year is dying in the night; :Ring out, wild bells, and let him die. : :Ring out the old, ring in the new, :Ring, happy bells, across the snow: :The year is going, let him go; :Ring out the false, ring in the true. : :Ring out the grief that saps the mind :For those that here we see no more; :Ring out the feud of rich and poor, :Ring in redress to all mankind. : :Ring out a slowly dying cause, :And ancient forms of party strife; :Ring in the nobler modes of life, :With sweeter manners, purer laws. : :Ring out the want, the care, the sin, :The faithless coldness of the times; :Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes :But ring the fuller minstrel in. : :Ring out false pride in place and blood, :The civic slander and the spite; :Ring in the love of truth and right, :Ring in the common love of good. : :Ring out old shapes of foul disease; :Ring out the narrowing lust of gold; :Ring out the thousand wars of old, :Ring in the thousand years of peace. : :Ring in the valiant man and free, :The larger heart, the kindlier hand; :Ring out the darkness of the land, :Ring in the Christ that is to be.

This tradition began in 1897 when the young Swedish actor Anders de Wahl was asked to recite the poem. De Wahl then performed the poem annually until his death in 1956. Since 1977 the Swedish national public TV broadcaster, SVT, has aired the event live, and the first to read the poem on television was the actor Georg Rydeberg. The show turned out to be a major success, and watching it on New Year's Eve quickly became a nationwide tradition. Rydeberg recited the poem until his death in 1983. After that many famous Swedish actors and/or singers have recited the poem, for example Jarl Kulle, Jan Malmsj√∂ and Margaretha Krook. The Swedish translation differs significantly from the English original. Inspired by the Swedish tradition, auto manufacturer Volvo used the poem in a 2016 New Year's Eve advertisement.

Bodyweight exercises are strength- training exercises that use the individual's own weight to provide resistance against gravity. Bodyweight exercises can enhance a range of biomotor abilities including strength, power, endurance, speed, flexibility, coordination and balance. This type of strength training has grown in popularity for both recreational and professional athletes. Bodyweight training utilises simple abilities such as pushing, pulling, squatting, bending, twisting and balancing. Movements such as the push-up, the pull-up, and the sit-up are some of the most common bodyweight exercises.  Advantages  squat exercise requires little space and no equipment. After squatting down the exerciser stands up again while moving their arms back to their sides. The height of the squat can be adjusted higher or lower depending on the requirements of the individual i.e. if someone is unused to exercise half or quarter squats can be performed. Due to their movement range, squats are frequently considered to be among the most effective exercises for improving strength and endurance.Stryker, Krista, 'Squats for a strong lower body' in The 12-Minute Athlete, New York: Tiller Press, 2020, p.43 While some exercises may require some type of equipment, the majority of bodyweight exercises require none. For those exercises that do require equipment, common items found in the household are usually sufficient (such as a bath towel for towel curls), or substitutes can usually be improvised (for example, using a horizontal tree branch to perform pull ups). Therefore, bodyweight exercises are convenient when travelling or on vacation, when access to a gym or specialised equipment may not be possible. Another advantage of bodyweight training is that there are no costs involved.  Disadvantages  As bodyweight exercises use the individual's own weight to provide the resistance for the movement, the weight being lifted is never greater than the weight of one's own body, which can limit new muscle growth. Another disadvantage is that bodyweight training may be daunting to novices and perceived as too easy for experienced athletes. Women, in general, also find it more difficult to do bodyweight exercises involving upper body strength and may be discouraged from undertaking these exercises in their fitness regimens.  Bodyweight exercise for older adults  Some bodyweight exercises have been shown to benefit not just the young, but the elderly as well. Older people undertaking bodyweight exercises benefit through increased muscle mass, increased mobility, increased bone density, decreased depression and improved sleep habits. It is also believed that bodyweight training may assist in decreasing or even preventing cognitive decline as people age. In addition, the increased risk of falls seen in elderly people can be mitigated by bodyweight training. Exercises focusing on the legs and abdomen such as squats, lunges and step ups are recommended to increase leg and core strength and, in doing so, reduce fall risk. These bodyweight exercises provide multi-directional movement that mimics daily activities, and can thus be preferable to using weight machines.

Fountaingrove Dam is an earthen dam built in 1953. It is high, long, and wide. In 1985, a private country club known as The Fountaingrove Club built a championship 18-hole golf course centered on Fountaingrove Lake.

The full name of the church is St Botolph without Aldgate and Holy Trinity Minories and it is sometimes known simply as Aldgate Church. The ecclesiastical parish was united with that of the Church of Holy Trinity, Minories, in 1899. The current 18th-century church building is made of brick with stone quoins and window casings. The tower is square with an obelisk spire. Position and dedication The church stands at the junction of Houndsditch and Aldgate High Street approximately 30 yards east of the former position of Aldgate, a defensive barbican in London's wall The church was one of four in medieval London dedicated to Saint Botolph or Botwulf, a 7th-century East Anglian saint, each of which stood by one of the gates to the City. The other three were near neighbour St Botolph-without- Bishopsgate (outside Bishopsgate), as well as St Botolph's Aldersgate (outside Aldersgate) and St Botolph's, Billingsgate by the riverside (near London Bridge - this church was destroyed by the Great Fire in 1666 and not rebuilt). It is believedLondon 800-126, Brooke and Keir, p146 the church just outside Aldgate is the first in London to have been dedicated to Botolph, with the other dedications following soon after. The Priory just inside Aldgate was founded by clergy from St. Botolph's Priory in Colchester, just under fifty miles along the Roman Road from Aldgate. The Priory at Colchester, like the church at Aldgate (though not the Priory at Aldgate), lay just outside the South Gate (also known as St Botolph's Gate) in the Colchester's Wall. The Priors held the land of the Portsoken, outside the wall, and are thought to have built and dedicated the church, St Botolph without Aldgate, that served it. The church of St Botolph's Church, Cambridge just outside the south gate of that city, may in turn, have taken its dedication from St Botolph-without- Bishopsgate to which it was linked by Ermine Street. By the end of the 11th century Botolph was regarded as the patron saint of boundaries, and by extension of trade and travel.Churches in the Landscape, p217-221, Richard Morris, This association with Travel was particularly strong before the legend of Saint Christopher became popular. These aspects of Botolph's patronage are thought to be the reason why churches at the City gates have this dedication.Richardsn, John (2001) The Annals of London: A Year-by-year Record of a Thousand Years of History, W&N;, (p. 16)  History  =Medieval church= The earliest known written record of the church dates from 1115, when it was received by the Holy Trinity Priory (recently founded by Matilda, wife of Henry I) but the parochial foundations may very well date from before 1066.\\"The City of London Churches\\" Betjeman, J Andover, Pikin, 1967 The church was rebuilt in the 16th century at the cost of the priors of the Holy Trinity, and renovated in 1621. It escaped the Great Fire of London, and was described at the beginning of the 18th century as \\"an old church, built of Brick, Rubble and Stone, rendered over, and ... of the Gothick order\\". The building, as it stood at that time, was and .

The exterior is of brick with projecting quoins, stone windows surrounds and a stone cornice. The tower, also of brick, has rusticated quoins, and a stone spire. The interior of the building is divided into nave and aisles by four widely spaced piers supporting a flat ceiling. There are galleries along three sides. The church is lit by two rows of windows in each side wall, one above and one below the gallery. The monuments from the old building were preserved, and reinstalled in the new church. = Nineteenth century = The interior was redecorated by John Francis Bentley, the architect of Westminster Cathedral in the late 19th century. St Botolph's was often referred to as the \\"Church of Prostitutes\\" in the late Victorian period. The church is sited on an island surrounded by roadways and it was usual in these times to be suspicious of women standing on street corners. They were easy targets for the police, and to escape arrest the prostitutes would parade around the island, now occupied by the church and Aldgate tube station. The parish was united with that of Holy Trinity, Minories when it closed in 1899. St Botolph's inherited from that church a preserved head, reputed to be that of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who had been executed for treason by Queen Mary I in 1554. = Twentieth century = The church was severely bombed at intervals during the Blitz in the Second World War. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. Following its restoration by Rodney Tatchell, the church was much damaged by an unexplained fire in 1965, necessitating further restoration. St Botolph's was rehallowed on 8 November 1966 by the Bishop of London, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Sir Robert Bellinger, the Lord Mayor of London, who attended in state. During an archaeological investigation of the crypt in 1990, a preserved head, reputed to be that of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who had been executed for treason by Queen Mary I in 1554, was rediscovered and buried in the churchyard.

It has undergone a historical restoration by the organ builders Goetze and Gwynn, and been returned to its 1744 specification using many of the original components. The organ has been described as the oldest church organ in the United Kingdom.http://www.organfocus.com/features/events/stbotolphs.doc Organ restoration press release Although there are older pipes and cases, this is the oldest collection of pipes in their original positions on their original wind chests.http://www.goetzegwynn.co.uk/restored/aldgate.shtml Restorers website Because of its historic importance, the organ was filmed and recorded for the documentary The Elusive English Organ. Donated by Thomas Whiting in 1676, it was built between 1702 and 1704. It was enhanced for the new church (the current building) by Harris' son-in-law, John Byfield, in 1740. The organ was considerably enlarged several times in the 19th century and again rebuilt by Mander Organs in the 1960s. The decision to restore the instrument was taken by St Botolph‚Äôs in 2002 after which a fundraising campaign was launched. The restoration, which took nine months, was carried out under the consultancy of Ian Bell and the workshops of Goetze and Gwynn in Welbeck, Nottinghamshire. The instrument was reinstalled in May 2006.

They were created in 1983 led by General Manuel Antonio Noriega and his General Staff. They were dismantled by the Armed Forces of the United States after the US invasion of Panama in 1989.  History  Before the coup d'√©tat in Panama of 1968 that overthrew President Arnulfo Arias Madrid, the military police were called National Guard. Since the 1950s and under the command of Colonel and President Jos√© Antonio Rem√≥n Cantera - assassinated in 1955 -, he negotiated with the US President Dwight D. Eisenhower issues of sovereignty and defense of the Panama Canal, obtaining important equipment for the police and the National Guard, as well as the training of pilots in Colombia and officers in the United States Military Academy. In 1964, the National Guard of Panama avoided having a conflict with the Armed Forces of the United States on Martyrs Day, staying quartered. In 1968, after the triumph of Arnulfo Arias in the elections and a few days after the swearing in of the same, there was a meeting between Arias and the high officers of the National Guard, General Vallarino, Colonels Pinilla and Urrutia and Lieutenant Colonel Torrijos, to agree on Vallarino's retirement, in return Arias would respect the law of the ladder. President Arnulfo Arias Madrid assumed on October 1, 1968, on October 10, the retirement ceremony of General Bol√≠var Vallarino, outgoing commander of the National Guard and unexpectedly the forced retirement of Colonel Jos√© Mar√≠a Pinilla F√°brega incoming commander, was held appointed Colonel Bol√≠var Urrutia as commander in chief and Lieutenant Colonel Aristides Hass√°n, second commander in chief of the National Guard, as well as a series of abrupt changes and transfers which violated the law of the ranks and the agreement reached between President Arias and the high command of the National Guard. In response to this, on October 11, Major Boris Mart√≠nez, head of the Chiriqu√≠ military zone and Lieutenant Colonel Omar Torrijos Herrera, who until now served as Executive Secretary of the National Guard command commanded the military coup against President Arias Madrid, the coup leaders offered the presidency to Ricardo J. Alfaro and Ra√∫l Arango, who at the time of the coup was the vice president of the republic and commander of the Benem√©rito Fire Corps of Panama who declined the offer of the military, Therefore, they decided to create the Government Military Board, which was headed by Colonels Jos√© Mar√≠a Pinilla and Bol√≠var Urrutia. All liberties and political rights of Panamanian citizenship were abolished, the 1946 Constitution was repealed and major transformations of political and social order in the Panamanian nation were initiated. During this time there were guerrilla movements in the city and in the interior of the country by the Panamanian left and the supporters of the ousted President Arias Madrid. There were also acts of war and sabotage against the government and the National Guard, freedom of expression was strongly censored by closing newspapers. The issuance of pamphlets and clandestine writings was developed. On February 24, 1969, Colonel Torrijos with a group of officers who supported in a maneuver as part of the intestine fights stun Colonel Boris Mart√≠nez and sent him on a plane to Miami as a military attache which he rejected and never had ties with the military staying to live there as an asylee. By December 1969, while General Omar Torrijos already attended an equestrian competition which his friend Fernando Eleta Almar√°n had invited his friend, a conspiracy composed of Colonels Jos√© Mar√≠a Pinilla, Bol√≠var Urrutia, Amado Sanjur, they tried to overthrow him, but Torrijos was supported by the then Major Manuel Antonio Noriega who served as head of the Chiriqu√≠ military zone, receiving him on the night of December 16, 1969, being called this day as Loyalty Day, once Torrijos entered Chiriqu√≠ the caravan of military and civilians who supported him grew as he went along from Chiriqu√≠, to the presidency of the republic which threw down all attempts at coup, definitively consolidating Torrijos in power, The National Guard managed to crush totally all kinds of opposition movement towards 1970. Suffocated all kinds of opposition movement, the already general Omar Torrijos Herrera took control and established in 1972 a National Assembly of Representatives, who immediately named him \\"Chief of State of the Panamanian Revolution.\\" This military body established a system of nationalist vindication, to which part of the private sector joined, and the country went through a period of social and cultural transformations, with the recovery of the Panama Canal as the main objective of Torrijos, and the creation of the ruling party, Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). At the same time, harmful and denounced characteristics were evidenced, such as armed repression, censorship of the printed press and the disappearance of political opponents at the beginning of said government. The Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977, demanded from the regime (called \\"the process\\" by its militants) democratization, its quartering and the call for elections. By 1978, General Torrijos abandoned power, but maintained control of the National Guard. After his death in a strange plane crash on July 31, 1981, - where the main suspect was the CIA for not accessing the requirements of the World Bank - the National Guard was involved in a power struggle between the military commanders involved . Colonel Florencio Flores took possession of the position of commander in chief for a few months, until after a conspiracy among senior officials of the General Staff they overthrow him by sending him to retirement. Given this, the conspiracy officers create a succession agreement to the command known as the Torrijos plan in which the first to ascend to the command would be Lieutenant Colonel Rub√©n Dar√≠o Paredes, then Lieutenant Colonel Armando Contreras will follow, Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Antonio Noriega would follow and culminate with Lieutenant Colonel Roberto D√≠az Herrera, the self-proclaimed General Rub√©n Dar√≠o Paredes Del R√≠o decided with his staff to carry out certain repressive actions against the media opposing the regime censuring some media. In a maneuver for power General Paredes retires Colonel Armando Contreras who had already reached the time to ascend to the command, maintaining links in front of the command until 1983. On August 20, 1983, Colonel Noriega was promoted to general and the National Guard Command and began a period marked by dictatorial decisions. His first decree was the change of the name of the military entity to the Defense Forces of Panama, with the mentality of converting the military police into an army for the joint tasks of the defense of the Panama Canal along with the United States Army. For the reorganization of the military institution, he had the military advice of Israeli intelligence experts and reputed military officers, among them the Argentine Colonel Mohamed Ali Seineld√≠n, veteran of the Falklands War and, at that time, military attach√© of the Republic Argentina in Panama. That year the closure of the School of the Americas was ordered, which for the CIA meant losing its best base in Central America. At the end of 1983 the political strategies were prepared to launch the official candidate of the 1984 elections: Colonel Noriega convinces General Paredes to benefit from his retirement and receive the support of the State and the Defense Forces to aspire to the presidency. Then, Paredes is betrayed, since the Comandancia and the PRD launch at the last moment Dr. Nicol√°s Ardito Barletta as the official candidate. Once orchestrated the electoral fraud by presidential decree, Noriega is promoted to General. = Military coup of October 3, 1989 = On October 3, 1989, a military coup was planned, in which some officers, under the command of Lt. Col. Mois√©s Giroldi Vera, tried to overthrow General Noriega, but 9 officers died in the attempt. Giroldi and his subordinates intended to end the economic embargo imposed by the United States, negotiate with the US military a political solution to a war action and create a commission to review the outcome of the 1989 elections, which were canceled to deliver the presidency to the true winner, in this case to the political party ADO Civilista, headed by Guillermo Endara, Ricardo Arias Calder√≥n and Guillermo Ford. This would mean withdrawing General Noriega and his entire staff, as some colonels had more than 12 years of retirement and were still in their positions, earning high salaries, in contrast to the troops that failed to collect more than B /. 250 per month. In order to clean the deteriorated image of the Defense Forces, it was decided to withdraw Noriega, but they did not count on the general already having counterattack plans when changing power. The events led to terrorist actions, such as the cyanide contamination of the Chilibre water treatment plant, and then blamed the Americans for such action. Against this plan were Lieutenant Colonel Mois√©s Giroldi Vera and his followers, who obviously rejected him. Mois√©s Giroldi was captured along with 400 other police and coup soldiers and sent to Fuerte Cimarr√≥n, the basic military training school in Panama, and then sent to the Tinajitas Prison and Coiba, where many were tortured and subsequently executed. General Manuel Antonio Noriega ordered all the barracks to deliver the weapons of heavy caliber, which were stored in containers under the custody of the G-2 under the command of Colonel Luis C√≥rdoba. = End of Panama Defense Forces = By December 20, 1989, the Panama Defense Forces had already developed as a guerrilla and propaganda-type institution, rather than a regular army, due to the military instability caused by the attempted coup of Giroldi. Its armed component on the day of the US invasion did not have more than 4,000 men, very badly armed. After its dissolution, some AK-47 rifles with few ammunition and old M-16 A1 and T-65, short weapons such as UZI and Caliber 12 shotguns were left in the barracks. His firepower was limited to deal with the Americans no more than two hours. In addition, the general staff disintegrated and could not organize a plan for at least one guerrilla war against such action. The superiority of air fire with which the invading forces counted - such as the AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk combat helicopters - neutralized any day and night artillery fire, also adding the attacks of the AC-130 and modern and invisible to the F-117 and B-2 radar, all of which also caused the death of civilians whose figure has not yet been calculated. Even with all this against, the Defense Forces established a resistance. However, Panamanian citizens became reporters, informing the US military of the location of the weapons depots, key personnel and collaborators of General Noriega. The UN Security Council and the signatory countries of the Geneva Convention severely criticized the use by the United States of high-tech weapons against ill-equipped conventional forces and civil police forces, such as remote-controlled bombs and laser weapons; in addition to the violation of the sovereignty of a member country of the UN. Rangers during the attack on the Panama Defense Forces Command. Units such as the Macho de Monte, commanded by Major Gonzalo Gonz√°lez, and the Paz Battalion and C√©maco Battalion, were designed for the fight against counterinsurgency; unlike units such as the 2000 Battalion and the Military Police Battalion, which were conceived for the defense of the Panama Canal and that fought skirmishes in R√≠o Hato, Tinajitas, Tocumen and San Miguelito. The US Army attacked without contemplation the posts and seals of road patrols (traffic police and road safety), claiming the lives of simple police units that did not have weapons of war. There are photographs showing checkpoints of this body impacted by shots from continuous firearms (M60 7.62x51 NATO caliber machine guns). In addition, many police officers were found executed with grace shots, mainly with shots in the neck. These statements are also supported by testimonies of Honduran day laborers who unloaded plastic bags with corpses taken from Panama to the base of Comayagua in Honduras days after the invasion in an AC-130 plane and could see, in some broken bags, badges of the forces Panamanians These testimonies coincide with the photos taken by the also murdered Spanish reporter Juantxu Rodr√≠guez, who was shot dead by a tank in front of the Marriott Hotel (now Sheraton Hotel). = After the new post-invasion democratic government = When the Defense Forces were dismantled, the government of Guillermo Endara (1989-1994) was commissioned to form a new institution with the help of the US army, which provided the first khaki uniforms. The force, initially a police vocation, was attached to the Public Force, idealized by the then Vice President Ricardo Arias Calder√≥n. The new government organized it as a police force of the Panamanian state, subordinated to the executive branch; calling it National Police with the explicit purpose of providing protection to the life, honor and property of nationals wherever they are and of foreigners under the jurisdiction of their territory. Colonel Roberto Armijo was appointed as the first head of this police force. In order to grant legal bases to the new police organization, Executive Decree No. 38 of February 10, 1990 was issued, through which the Public Force was organized, one of whose components is the National Police. The Executive appointed Colonel Eduardo Herrera Hassan as Director of that Force. Then, Herrera Hass√°n is dismissed on charges of conspiracy in August, replacing Lieutenant Colonel Fernando Quezada, who in turn was dismissed in October of the same year, by opening a public discussion with the director of a newspaper. Herrera Hass√°n tries to give a coup d'√©tat on December 5, 1990, giving as a final consequence the level of senior officers in the institution, only allowing the maintenance of said ranking to the rank of Major. Instead, Mr. Ebrahim Asvat was appointed.  Structure  = Land Forces = As an army corps, its members considered themselves as police and soldiers at the same time. Until 1989 there were a total of 16300 troops and about 3800 reservists and civil collaborators called the Dignity Battalions, trained in support of the possible invasion of a foreign country. The Panama Defense Forces had three combat battalions and eight infantry companies, plus special forces units. Each military zone had one or two reaction squads. The country was divided into twelve military zones, which were generally led by a major or a lieutenant colonel. As weapons, the infantry had fifty light cannons, eight hundred heavy mortars and one thousand light ones; Fifty KPV 14.5 x 114 Russian anti-aircraft machine guns (known as \\"4 Mouths\\"), armored vehicles V150 and V300. The infantry was armed with Russian rifles AK-47, AKM and rocket-propelled grenade launchers RPG-7 and RPG-18, in addition to US weapons such as the M16-A1, M-60 machine guns and .45 caliber service guns. Another important aspect is that this park highlighted the existence of ZU-23-4 and ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft weapons, Chinese-made versions, and 4 120 mm calipers.

Tiberio Fiorilli, also spelled Fiorillo and Fiurelli (November 9, 1608 ‚Äì December 7, 1694)\\"Fiorillo, Tiberio\\" in The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (15th edition, Chicago, 1991) vol. 4, p. 787. was an Italian actor of commedia dell'arte known for developing the role of Scaramouche. He was especially popular in France, where he was the director of the troupe of the Com√©die-Italienne, which shared with the troupe of his friend Moli√®re at the theatre of the Petit-Bourbon, and the theatre of the Palais-Royal.Laurence Sinelick, \\"Fiorilli, Tiberio\\" in Banham 1995, p. 373.Campardon 1880, vol. 1, pp. 222‚Äì234.Maupoint 1733, p. 281. Life He was born in Naples, but left Italy around 1640 for unknown reasons, perhaps simply while following a troupe of actors, or to flee a political intrigue. He arrived in France under the reign of Louis XIII. His acting pleased the queen, which enabled him to attend the court. Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche by Pietro Paolini It is said that one day, when the two-year-old Dauphin cried (the future Louis XIV), Fiorilli, as Scaramouche, made any possible sound to comfort him. He achieved this task with grimaces and tomfoolery; consequently, the Dauphin had \\"a need, that he had at the time, the hands and the dress of Scaramouche\\". Fiorilli was then ordered to visit the court every night to amuse the Dauphin, which helped the Scaramouche character become a stock figure in the theatre of the time. The character of Scaramouche became a standard role thereafter of the commedia dell'arte. Fiorilli's style differed from other commedia dell'arte players. He abandoned the mask and used the expressiveness of his face to enhance the comedy. His large eyes and eyebrows and long nose contributed to this effect, and he wore moustaches that framed the corners of his mouth and a thin, short goatee. These practices influenced Moli√®re, and by most accounts the two actors developed a close relationship during the years they shared the same theaters. Some critics went so far as to accuse Moli√®re of being Scaramouche's ape. One engraving shows Moli√®re mimicking Scaramouche's grimaces with the help of a mirror.Gaines 2002, pp. 419‚Äì420. In the 1670s Fiorilli portrayed Scaramouche in London with great success. He was capable of deft physical farce, including dancing and acrobatics. It is reported that in his 80s he maintained the ability to simulate a kick to another actor's face. Fiorilli died in Paris and is buried in the √âglise Saint-Eustache. In literature Scaramouche (Fiorilli) teaching √âlomire (Moli√®re) his student, frontispiece to Le Boulanger de Chalussay's attack on Moli√®re, 1670 * , called Mezetin, wrote a \\"picaresque but untrustworthy biography\\": La Vie de Scaramouche (The Life of Scaramouche), published in Paris in 1695 and Brussels in 1699.Costantini 1695. * Rafael Sabatini wrote a novel entitled Scaramouche, remotely inspired by Fiorilli's life. * A stage musical, Scaramouche - The Zany Commedia Musical, with book, lyrics and music by Stephen Lanigan-O'Keeffe, was premiered in Hoxton Hall, London, UK in 2007 and revised and restaged in 2011. The musical is a fusion of musical theatre and commedia dell'arte practices and treats Fiorillo's life and career as a parable on celebrity culture. Notes Bibliography * Banham, Martin (1995).

Early life  Kramer was born in New York City on June 10, 1932 into a prominent and wealthy family. He was the son of Manhattan poloist and yachtsman, Albert Ludlow Kramer Jr. (1907‚Äì1971) and Mary (n√©e Delafield) Kramer, who married in June 1931. In 1935, his parents divorced and his father remarried to Melva Peshmalyan Colt (daughter of Byron Peshmalyan and widow of Roswell C. Colt) in December 1939. In April 1940, they also divorced and his father married Brenda Fiske, a daughter of Archibald F. C. Fiske, in 1940. His family had a home in New York City and an estate designed by Peabody, Wilson & Brown in Old Westbury on Long Island known as Picket Farm (demolished after a fire destroyed the home in 1977). His paternal grandparents were Margaretta Stockton (n√©e Beasley) Delafield and the former president of the Bank of America Edward Coleman Delafield of Riverdale (a grandson of Joseph Delafield and descendant of Margret (n√©e Lewis) Livingston and Maturin Livingston). His paternal grandparents were Anna (n√©e Bement) Kramer and the industrialist, banker and lawyer Albert Ludlow Kramer, who served as vice president of the Equitable Trust Company. After his grandmother's death in 1931, his grandfather married Anna's cousin, Alice (n√©e Bishop), in 1932. Together, Albert and Alice authored many books, including The Life in the Vine, The Unlocked Door, and I Bring You Joy. His paternal aunt, Martha Leighton Kramer, was the wife of Robert Livingston Gerry Jr. and mother of petroleum executive Robert L. Gerry III. He graduated from Brooks School in Andover, Massachusetts.  Career  After attending the Brooks School, Kramer served in the U.S. Air Force as a Sergeant. In 1955, he moved to Tacoma, Washington, where he worked in the banking industry. = Political career = In 1961, Kramer moved to Seattle with his family and was elected to the Seattle City Council at the age of 29. In 1964, he became the youngest Secretary of State in Washington State history on the Republican ticket. He served for three terms. His major initiatives dealt with migrant housing, election law reform, lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, and various social justice programs for minorities. In 1969, Kramer chaired the Washington State Commission on the Cause and Prevention of Civil Disorder. The \\"Kramer Commission\\" examined issues of racial discrimination in housing and the justice system. In 1974, Kramer ran to represent the Third District in Southwest Washington in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost the race to Democrat Don Bonker, whom Kramer beat in the race for Washington Secretary of State in 1972. = Later life= After his unsuccessful bid for U.S. Congress, Kramer resigned in the middle of his third term as secretary of state in 1975 to create the Ludlow Foundation. The purpose of the Ludlow Foundation was to provide small grants to lower-income people and non-profit organizations.  Personal life Kramer married his wife Patricia. They were married for 17 years and divorced for 17 years then got remarried. They had two daughters and two sons: * Mary Kramer, Vice-President of the Ludlow Foundation who married Kenji Higuchi. * William \\"Bill\\" Kramer, president of the Ludlow Foundation. * Ann Kramer, who married David Vey, Treasurer of the Ludlow Foundation. * John Kramer, Secretary of the Ludlow Foundation.

They officially ceased to hold this title from 1943, with the merger of Free French Forces with General Giraud's anti-German forces, but were still commonly known by the title until the liberation of France in 1944, when they became the regular French Air Army. They were commanded by Martial Henri Valin from 1941 to 1944, who subsequently became commander of the Air Army. Fighting for Free France ‚Äî the FAFL in French North Africa (1940‚Äì1943) French Dewoitine D.520. On 17 June 1940, five days before the signing of the Franco-German Armistice, the first \\"exodus\\" (of 10 airmen) took flight from Bordeaux-M√©rignac to England. Others rallied to General Charles de Gaulle from France and French North Africa during the period June 1940 to November 1942. A contingent of volunteers from South American countries such as Uruguay, Argentina and Chile was also created, as Free French officials recruited there personally. From a strength of 500 in July 1940, the ranks of the FAFL grew to 900 by 1941, including 200 flyers. A total of 276 of these flyers were stationed in England, and 604 were stationed in overseas theaters of operation. In the summer of 1940 General de Gaulle named then-Colonel Martial Henri Valin as commander-in-chief of the FAFL. Valin was at the French military mission in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil at the time of his appointment and he had to complete his assignment there by February 1941. It took him 45 days to get to London to see de Gaulle and it was not until 9 July that Valin formally assumed office taking over from the caretaker commander, Admiral Emile Muselier. The Cross of Lorraine was the symbol adopted for the Free French forces during World War II French Equatorial and West Africa between 1940 and 1943.Free French Forces (1940-1944) at fivestarflags.com Soldier's Service Book of a Chilean born Free French Air Force Pilot. One of many who joined the call made by General de Gaulle around French Colonies and South America. All FAFL aircraft were to be identified differently from those of the Vichy French air force, which continued to use the pre-war tricolor roundel. In order to distinguish their allegiance from that of Vichy France, the Cross of Lorraine - a cross with two parallel horizontal arms, with the lower arm slightly longer than the upper one - was the symbol of Free France chosen by Charles de Gaulle. The cross could be seen in the same places on FAFL aircraft where the roundels used to be on all French military aircraft, that is, on the fuselage and on the lower and upper surfaces of the wings. The FAFL was formed with one ‚Äúmixed‚Äù unit at RAF Odiham on August 29, 1940, under the command of Commandant (Major) Lionel de Marmier. One of its first jobs was to try to persuade the governors-general of colonies in French West Africa not to submit to the orders of the Vichy government, and instead join the Free French in their continuing fight against the Axis Powers of Germany and Italy. Operation Menace was the Allied plan to persuade Dakar (as de Gaulle believed was possible) to join the Allied cause, or capture it by force. Among the units taking part was the newly formed FAFL Groupe de Combat Mixte (GMC) 1, code-named \\"Jam\\", consisted of four squadrons, composed of Bristol Blenheim bombers and Westland Lysander liaison/observation aircraft. The resulting Battle of Dakar was a failure. The port remained in Vichy control, FAFL envoys were arrested and imprisoned at Dakar by the Vichy authorities, and de Gaulle's standing was damaged. However, French forces in Cameroon and Chad, in French Equatorial Africa, rallied to the Gaullist cause. There were three detachments of French air force units ‚Äî based at Fort-Lamy (now N‚ÄôDjamena) (Chad), Douala (Cameroon) and Pointe-Noire (Congo) ‚Äì operating a mixed bag of Potez and Bloch aircraft, and they thus became part of the FAFL. However, Gabon remained loyal to Vichy, so, in mid- to late October 1940, FAFL squadrons set out on photo-reconnaissance and leaflet-dropping missions. The first combats between Vichy and the FAFL took place on 6 November 1940, when two Vichy air force aircraft took on two FAFL Lysanders near Libreville. Both aircraft sustained damage but made it back to base. Two days later, the first FAFL airmen were shot down and taken prisoner. Two days after that, Libreville was taken by Free French army troops, resulting in the FAFL aircraft now operating from the air base that had been used by their opponents of a few days before. The French attitude towards the fighting was that of a ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù that was being won for Free France, since now Libreville had joined the Gaullist cause. As it happened, this would be the only time when opposing factions within FEA territory would fight each other openly. Philippe de Hauteclocque, better known by his French resistance name of \\"Leclerc\\", who later became one of the most famous French army generals in history, had strong ambitions in North Africa. But in outlining what he wanted the FAFL to do, he often revealed a complete lack of understanding of what it was actually capable of. When he demanded that the Italian-held airfield at Koufra in Libya was to be bombed, he was told, matter-of-factly, that the squadrons had no capability of carrying out such a major mission, especially given the lack of experience in navigating over vast desert territory. Leclerc's reaction, based on his fury at lack of air support during the German invasion of France, was ugly, and relations between him and the FAFL deteriorated rapidly. A mission carried out by the recently formed Groupe de Bombardement (GRB) 1 (Lorraine) on February 4, 1941, ended disastrously when, out of four Blenheims sent to bomb Koufra, only a single one returned ‚Äì and, even then, it was because of engine trouble. (It was not until 1959 that one of the other three aircraft was found.) On February 27, the Free French took Koufra airfield, while the enemy garrison surrendered two days afterwards. Leclerc, for his part, still regarded aviation as a kind of appendage, of such minor importance that it might as well not be there to support the ground forces at all. Following the Fall of France in 1940, there were French airmen who were determined to continue the fight against Nazi Germany. Some of these men joined the RAF, whereas others joined the FAFL directly. Those airmen who had joined the RAF were fighting in the armed forces of a foreign nation, and were technically breaking French civil law. As such, they could be classified as a mercenary or filibuster, as well as the charge of desertion under a court martial. On 15 April 1941, de Gaulle issued a formal declaration, requesting that French nationals in the RAF were to apply to be reincorporated in the FAFL by the 25th April 1941. Any personnel making the transfer would be exempted from any wrongdoing.AIR 23/1461 folio 14 accessed at The National Archives, Kew. Not all French personnel complied with this ruling. Some of the personnel that had left Syria and Lebanon had specifically done so to join the RAF, and were opposed to de Gaulle. Consideration was given by the RAF to grant British citizenship to these men, so as not to alienate them. Whilst the FAFL certainly had a number of aircrew (several of whom had flown to the allies), it was weakened in its lack of ground crew, and a lack of spare parts for their French-built machines. Whilst the aircrew of GRB 1 were all French, the ground crew were initially British airmen.AIR 29/895 accessed at The National Archives, Kew. The arrival in the Middle East of former A√©ronavale ground crew from Tahiti in July 1941 was seen as a boost to the FAFL's maintenance personnel.AIR 8/371 accessed at The National Archives, Kew. The Groupe Bretagne was formed on 1 January 1942, with certain objectives in mind: U.S.-built Maryland aircraft would carry out long-range reconnaissance missions, the Lysanders close-support missions and the Potez liaison and transport missions. Yet it was not until March 3 that the first operational missions were carried out from Uigh el-K√©bir, which had only been captured the previous day. The very next day, however, a Lysander crashed on landing, injuring its pilot, who had to be evacuated to hospital. On March 7, the FAFL had some success when some Lysanders successfully destroyed three enemy aircraft on the ground at Um el-Aranel; one of them was chased by an Italian fighter plane, but it managed to get back to base, albeit sustaining considerable damage. For most of 1942, the Groupe Bretagne concentrated mostly on liaison and training flights, yet, in late autumn, Leclerc wanted to count on the FAFL for supporting ground offensives against the Italians in the wake of the victory of the British 8th Army against the Afrika Korps at the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Anglo-American invasion of Morocco during Operation Torch. However, lack of co-operation between Leclerc's general staff based at Algiers and the Allies seemed to indicate a power struggle between him and de Gaulle since the latter was in charge of the Free French forces in London. Though FAFL airplanes from the ‚ÄúRennes‚Äù squadron of the Groupe Bretagne did engage Italian forces towards the end of 1942 and the beginning of 1943, problems with both weapons and the aircraft themselves (mostly engine trouble resulting in forced-landings) dogged the efforts of the aircrews. January 23, 1943, witnessed the fall of Tripoli ‚Äì and the end of the air war for the Groupe. The Anglo-American landing in North Africa in November 1942 was the starting point for the rebirth of the French Air Force, thanks to the commitment by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, of 1,000 planes, and the French began to receive U.S.-built aircraft to replenish its squadrons. GCII/5 was the first unit organized, at first consisting of a single squadron of P-40 Tomahawk fighters acquired from the United States Army Air Forces, because of its ties to the Lafayette Escadrille in World War I. Operating from a forward base at Thelepte, Tunisia, the two squadrons of GCII/5 fought alongside American units in clearing North Africa of Axis forces in 1943. On July 1, 1943, the Algiers-based Arm√©e de l'Air general staff (which received its orders from de Gaulle and General Giraud) and the FAFL general staff were merged and placed under the command of General Bouscat. He conducted the reorganization of the French Air Force, incorporating all elements coming from the ex-Vichy French Army in North Africa and the FAFL. Those forces included about twenty various Groups equipped mainly with Dewoitine D.520s, LeO 45s, Glenn Martin bombers, Bloch MB.175 reconnaissance aircraft, and an assortment of Amiots, Farmans, and Potez 540 transport aircraft. One squadron, two identities: GC 2/7 (No.326 ‚ÄúNice‚Äù Squadron) (1943‚Äì1945) P-40Fs at Casablanca, 9 January 1943. Bristol Mercury XV radial engine on a Bristol Blenheim Mk.IV bomber at an airfield in North Africa. Altogether, under the umbrella of the Allies (not just in North Africa, but also in Sicily and Corsica), there were nine FAFL fighter groups, three of which were designated as RAF fighter squadrons, namely No.326 (‚ÄúNice‚Äù), No.327 (‚ÄúCorse‚Äù) and No.328 (‚ÄúProvence‚Äù) Squadrons, with other units similarly named after regions in metropolitan France: Roussillon, Champagne, Navarre, Lafayette, Dauphin√© and Ardennes. Similarly, there were six bomber groups (Bretagne, Maroc, Gascogne, Bourgogne, S√©n√©gal and Franche-Comt√©), one reconnaissance group (Belfort) and one transport group (Anjou). Following the dissolution of the Vichy French naval aviation arm, the second escadrille of the combat fighter group GC II/7 accepted several navy pilots into its ranks. In March 1943, it received its first British aircraft; Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vb fighters. When GC II/7 was broken up in August, the squadron received two designations ‚Äì one of which was French, the other British ‚Äì by virtue of the fact that its complement included both French and British pilots. While the British designated the unit No.326 Squadron of the RAF, the French knew their squadron as GC 2/7, even though it was attached to No. 345 Wing of the Mediterranean Allied Coastal Air Force (MACAF). Its first mission as GC 2/7 was an armed reconnaissance mission on April 30, 1943, during the final phase of the war in North Africa, by which time the Luftwaffe had all but vanished, but ground-based Flak units still remained. By May 13, the Germans had surrendered in North Africa, and GC 2/7 had by then flown 42 missions, accumulating 296 sorties. On June 18, the squadron replaced its Mk.Vb Spitfires with the more capable Mk.IX variant, built originally to combat the German Focke-Wulf Fw 190, an example of which had been credited to GC 2/7 just seven days earlier. September 1943 witnessed the participation of GC 2/7 in the liberation of Corsica, claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed for the loss of two of its pilots. On the 27th, the squadron, alongside GC 1/3, had the distinction of becoming the first Arm√©e de l'Air unit to be stationed on French soil, since the dissolution of the Vichy French air force the previous December, when it occupied the airfield at Ajaccio-Campo dell‚ÄôOro. Now part of No.332 Wing, the squadron's duties encompassed patrols over the island of Corsica itself, interception of German bombers attacking the island, protection of Allied convoys traversing the Mediterranean, attacks against German shipping berthed in Italian ports, and, from January 1944, the escort of USAAF bombers attacking targets in Italy. From the spring of 1944, GC 2/7 would involve itself both in strafing and dive-bombing attacks against ground targets in coastal regions of western Italy as well as the island of Elba, famous as the place of temporary exile of Napoleon in 1814 prior to his escape. Finally, in September 1944, GC 2/7 found itself based in metropolitan France itself and was assigned to the same kind of missions that it had conducted over Italy. However, its commanding officer, Captain Georges Valentin, was shot down by flak over Dijon on the 8th, while another, Captain Gauthier, was shot down a week later, only he managed to reach Switzerland from where, having been interned, he ‚Äúescaped‚Äù to rejoin his unit. As the front line advanced eastwards towards Reich territory, GC 2/7 went to Luxeuil, from where missions flown in early October resulted in four enemy aircraft being confirmed destroyed and another one counted as a ‚Äúprobable‚Äù. Christmas Eve saw GC 2/7 escorting B-26 bombers. \\"Around 20\\" enemy fighters attacked the formation, and GC 2/7 claimed four of them destroyed, but the French lost one of their pilots in the process. GC 2/7 frequently clashed with the enemy as the Allies advanced farther into Nazi Germany ‚Äì including a sighting of two Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters on March 22, 1945, which were just too fast for the piston-engined Spitfires. On April 14, sixteen of the squadron's aircraft were escorting Lockheed F-5s when they were intercepted by a mixed formation of Bf 109s and Fw 190s, two of which were claimed by GC 2/7 pilots, yet one pilot was shot down and became ‚Äì for the brief duration that the war in Europe yet had to run ‚Äì a prisoner. By the time the war did end on May 8, GC 2/7 had, since its formation two years earlier, accomplished just over 7,900 sorties. Red Star: the R√©giment Normandie- Niemen fighting for the Soviet Union (1942‚Äì1945) Six months after the Germans invaded the USSR, talks aimed at closer co-operation between Free France and the Soviet Union resulted in a squadron being especially created with an initial core of twelve fighter pilots being sent east. The Groupe de Chasse GC 3 Normandie was officially promulgated by de Gaulle on 1 September 1942, with Commandant Pouliquen in command. Mechanics, pilots and hardware were transported by rail and air via Tehran (Iran) to Baku (now the capital of Azerbaijan). A period of training on the Yakovlev Yak-7 was completed by mid- February 1943 when Commandant Jean Tulasne took command of the groupe, which finally headed for the front on 22 March 1943. The first campaign of GC 3, equipped with the Yakovlev Yak-1 fighter plane, lasted until 5 October, and encompassed the area of Russia between Polotniani-Zavod and Sloboda/Monostirtchina. From an initial aerial victory over an Fw 190 on 5 April the tally rose dramatically and the squadron became the focus of much Soviet propaganda, so much so that Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel (who was executed in 1946 after the Nuremberg trials) decreed that any French pilot captured would be executed. Tragedy struck the squadron when the much- decorated Tulasne was reported missing in action after combat on 17 July requiring Commandant Pierre Pouyade to take command. In spite of the loss, GC 3 started to receive many Soviet unit citations and decorations as well as French ones. On October 11, de Gaulle accorded the groupe the title of Compagnon de la Lib√©ration. By the time GC 3 relocated to Toula on 6 November 1943, there were only six surviving pilots from the groupe, which had accumulated 72 aerial victories since joining the fighting. 1944 witnessed the expansion of the groupe to become a r√©giment, with a fourth escadrille joining its ranks. After training at Toula was completed on more advanced Yak-9D fighter planes, the new regiment rejoined the front line for its second campaign. This lasted until November 27 and took in the area between Doubrovka (in Russia) and Gross-Kalweitchen (in East Prussia, Germany). It was during this campaign that Joseph Stalin allowed the regiment to style itself Normandie-Niemen in recognition of its participation in the battles to liberate the river of that name. On October 16, the first day of a new offensive against East Prussia, the easternmost part of the Reich home territory, the regiment's pilots destroyed 29 enemy aircraft without loss. By the following month, the regiment was itself based in Reich territory. By the end of the year, Pouyade had been released from his command of the regiment and he, along with other veteran pilots, returned to France. 14 January 1945, saw the Normandie-Niemen regiment start its third campaign (from Dopenen to Heiligenbeil), concentrating in the East Prussian part of the German Reich, until victory in the east was formally announced on May 9, the day after VE Day in western Europe. By that day, the regiment had shot down 273 enemy aircraft and had received many citations and decorations. Stalin expressed his gratitude to the regiment by offering the unit's Yak-3s to France, to which the pilots returned to a hero's welcome in Paris on 20 June 1945. Thus, the regiment became the only air combat group from a western European country (apart from the brief intervention by No. 151 Wing RAF when introducing Hawker Hurricanes to Russia) to participate in the war on the Eastern Front. Its flag bore the testimony of its battle experience with names such as Bryansk, Orel, Ielnia, Smolensk, Koenigsberg (later renamed Kaliningrad by the Soviets), and Pillau. It received the following decorations: from France, the Companion of the L√©gion d'Honneur, the Croix de la Lib√©ration, the M√©daille militaire, the Croix de Guerre with six palmes; from the USSR, it received the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Alexander Nevsky, with eleven citations between the two orders.

Career Reguly won his first National Newspaper Award in 1964 for tracking down union leader Hal Banks, a fugitive who had fled to Brooklyn, New York. He won his second Award in 1966 for tracking down and interviewing Gerda Munsinger, an East German woman at the center of a Canadian political sex scandal. The Star then gave him a coveted posting as Washington D.C. bureau chief, where he moved with his family in the summer of 1966. In May 1967, Reguly was sent to South Vietnam to cover the Vietnam War, then at its height. He filed dozens of stories for the Star reporting on American combat efforts, starting with Operation Hickory, the first U.S. invasion of the DMZ (the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Vietnam). Reguly also witnessed and reported on the forced relocation of Montagnard tribespeople in the Central Highlands, telling his readers that such operations might be \\"creating more Viet Cong\\". After returning to the United States, Reguly covered the 1968 US presidential campaign. According to his son, Eric, \\"the only event he covered that truly shattered him was Bobby Kennedy's assassination\\" at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. (He was standing less than 10 metres from Kennedy when the senator was shot.) Reguly garnered a third National Newspaper Award for his coverage of anti-war protests and race riots. In 1977, Reguly left the Star to join the staff of the Toronto Sun, where he specialized in investigative pieces on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In 1981, he left the Sun and became a spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. After his retirement, he became a successful freelance writer, writing mainly for outdoors magazines. In 2001, he was nominated for a Canadian National Magazine Award for an article in Outdoor Canada magazine. Personal life Reguly married his wife, Ada, in 1956. The couple had three children, including journalist Eric Reguly, who writes for The Globe and Mail. Reguly contracted heart disease in his last years. He died at his Toronto residence on 24 February 2011.

It lies in the ward of Cornhill. The medieval structure was lost in the Great Fire of London, and replaced by the present building, traditionally attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. The upper parts of the tower are by Nicholas Hawksmoor. The church was embellished by Sir George Gilbert Scott and Herbert Williams in the nineteenth century. Early history The church of St Michael was in existence by 1133. The patronage was in the possession of the Abbot and convent of Evesham until 1503, when it was settled on the Drapers' Company. A new tower was built in 1421, possibly after a fire. John Stow described the church as \\"fair and beautiful, but since the surrender of their lands to Edward VI, greatly blemished by the building of four tenements on the north side thereof, in the place of a green church-yard\\". On the south side of the church was a churchyard with what Stow calls a \\"proper cloister\\", with lodgings for choristers, and a pulpit cross, at which sermons were preached. These were maintained by Sir John Rudstone, after whose death in 1530 the choir was dissolved and the cross fell into decay.John Stow, A Svrvay of London (1603), pp. 196-99 (Google). Churchwardens' accounts and other memoranda of the medieval and Tudor church are in print,Overall, W.H., ed. (1871), The Accounts of the Churchwardens of the Parish of St Michael, Cornhill (Alfred James Waterlow, for the vestry, London). and the parish registers from 1546 to 1754 are published by the Harleian Society.J.L. Chester, The Parish Registers of St Michael, Cornhill, London, Harleian Society, Registers Series VII (London 1882) (Internet Archive). A folk tale, dating from the early 16th century, tells of a team of bellringers who once saw 'an ugly shapen sight' appear as they were ringing the bells during a storm. They fell unconscious, but later discovered scratch marks in the masonry. For years afterward these were pointed out as the 'Devil's clawmarks'. Rebuilding after the Great Fire The interior from the entrance looking down the aisle The medieval church, except for the tower, was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666;Tabor, M., The City Churches: London, The Swarthmore Press Ltd, 1917, p. 93 the present building was begun in 1672. The design is traditionally attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. However, the authors of the Buildings of England guide to the City churches believe Wren's office had no involvement with the rebuilding of the body of the church, the parish having dealt directly with the builders. The new church was 83 feet long and 67 feet wide, divided into nave and aisles by Doric columns, with a groined ceiling. There was an organ at the west end, and a reredos with paintings of Moses and Aaron at the east. The walls, George Godwin noted, did not form right angles, indicating the re- use of the medieval foundations. The fifteenth-century tower, having proved unstable, was demolished in 1704 by order of the Archbishop. A replacement, 130 feet high, was completed in 1721. In contrast to the main body of the church it was built in a Gothic style, in imitation of that of Magdalen College, Oxford. Construction had begun in 1715, with money from the coal fund. The designer of the lower stages was probably William Dickinson, working in Christopher Wren's office. Funds proved inadequate, and work stopped in 1717 with the tower half-completed. The tower was eventually completed in 1722 with the aid of a grant from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, the upper stages being to the designs of its surveyor, Nicholas Hawksmoor. Containing elaborately panelled turrets, Hawksmoor's tower contains King's Chapel terminations in the pinnacles. Repairs were made in 1751, 1775, and 1790, the last two of which were done under the survey of George Wyatt. In the 1790 repairs, the south aisle windows and the east window were made circular; as well, a new pulpit, desk, altar rail, east window glass, and 12 new brass branches were added. Victorian alterations In the late 1850s, the Drapers' Company, motivated by legislation that would have forced them to hand certain funds over to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners if they were not spent on St Michael's, decided to fund a lavish scheme of embellishment, and asked George Gilbert Scott to carry out the work. J. B. Philip's tympanum sculpture St Michael disputing with Satan Scott demolished a house that had stood against the tower, replacing it with an elaborate porch, built in the \\"Franco-Italian Gothic\\" style (1858‚Äì1860), facing the street of Cornhill.Tucker, T., The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 It is decorated with carving by John Birnie Philip, which includes a high-relief tympanum sculpture depicting \\"St Michael disputing with Satan\\". Scott inserted Gothic tracery to the circular clerestory windows, and into the plain round-headed windows on the south side of the church. New side windows were created in the chancel, and an elaborate stone reredos, incorporating the paintings of Moses and Aaron by artist Robert Streater from its predecessor, was constructed in an Italian Gothic style. A contemporary account of the work explained that this was appropriate since \\"the classical feeling which pervades the Italian school of Gothic art enabled the architect to bring the classical features of the building into harmony with the Gothic treatment which our present sympathies demand\\". The chancel walls were lined with panels of coloured marble, up to the level of the top of the reredos columns, and richly painted above this point. It was said that Scott \\"proposes to brighten all the roof with colour... and he fuses the vaulting into something transitional between Pointed and Italian. And he inserts tracery in all the round-headed windows, and the great ugly stable-like circles of the clerestory become roses under his plastic hand.\\" Stained glass by Clayton and Bell was installed, with a representation of Christ in Glory in the large circular east window. Its splays were enriched with inlaid and carved marble, with four heads in high relief enclosed in medallions. The other windows contained a series of stained glass images illustrating the life of Christ, with the crucifixion at the west end. Entrance to St Michael, Cornhill, with war memorial to the right A further campaign of medievalising decoration was carried out in the late 1860s by Herbert Williams, who had worked with Scott on the earlier scheme. Williams built a three-bay cloister-like passage, with plaster vaults, on the south side of the building, and in the body of the church added richly painted decoration to Wren's columns and capitals. The reredos was enriched with inlaid marble, and the chancel was given new white marble steps and a mosaic floor of Minton‚Äôs tesserae and tiles. In what the Building News described as a \\"startling novelty\\", a circular opening was cut in the vault of each aisle bay and filled with stained glass, and skylights installed above. Few original furnishings were retained in its Victorian re- imagining, but the 1672 font given by James Paul survived, although a new balustrade was added.Cobb, G., The Old Churches of London: London, Batsford, 1942 Recent history A First World War memorial was unveiled beside the entrance to the church in 1920, featuring a bronze statue of St Michael by Richard Reginald Goulden. The memorial became a Grade II* listed building in December 2016. The church escaped serious damage during the Second World War, and was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. In 1960, the Victorian polychrome paintwork was replaced with a more restrained colour scheme of blue, gold and white. A new ring of twelve bells, cast by Taylors of Loughborough, was installed in the tower in April 2011.http://www.london.anglican.org/NewsShow_14424 Retrieved 15 April 2011 The church has one of the oldest sets of churchwarden's records in the City of London, which are now kept in the Guildhall Library. The Book of Common Prayer, the King James Bible and the English Hymnal continue to be used in services. The church is a corporate member of the Prayer Book Society. The church vestry hosts the annual ward mote and polling station for the City of London ward of Cornhill.

While the organizations had been raising more than $1 billion annually, they had faced concerns that the individual organizations were not as relevant as during the Holocaust and the creation of the State of Israel, with many major donors seeking to direct their philanthropy through their own foundations rather than through the umbrella organizations. The balance of power would shift to the federations, which would select about two-thirds of the 120 members on the board of trustees of the new organization. Businessman and philanthropist Charles Bronfman was chosen as the volunteer chairman of the combined entity, responsible for planning the group's strategic direction.Abelson, Reed (February 14, 1999). \\"Merger Near, 2 Jewish Philanthropy Groups Pick a Leader\\".

It comprises 37 studios for visual artists and a gallery in Deptford. History APT was founded in 1995, at Harold Works, Creekside, Deptford. Harold Works was put on the market in the early 90s and in due course a group of artists from the Greenwich Artists Studio Association (GASA) negotiated a sale. An agreement was made with their newly established charity, Art in Perpetuity Trust, to takeout a lease with an option to buy the freehold. So in 1995, the artists took over and began converting the warehouse and building into studios. The conversion of Harold Works was accomplished over three to four months, mainly by a small number of APT artists. Thirty seven studios and a gallery space were created and APT artists began to move in from May to August 1995. The option to purchase Harold Wharf was exercised by APT in 1999. Gallery APT's complex houses a modest, double room gallery which is available to hire and runs frequent shows. Exhibition proposals are considered by the APT Gallery committee. Future APT is currently in the process of seeking funds for a development of seven new studios for which planning permission was granted in 2005. APT's Studio & Visual Arts Development Programme is looking to the next ten years and incorporates plans to improve the studios, increase access and facilities for people with disabilities, residency and fellowship programmes, and active links and support work with similar organisations locally, nationally and internationally.

It tells the story of four gifted children: Reynie Muldoon, George \\"Sticky\\" Washington, Kate Wetherall, and Constance Contraire, who form the \\"Mysterious Benedict Society\\" and are sent to investigate an institution called L.I.V.E. (the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened), run by a man named Ledroptha Curtain. Plot Reynard \\"Reynie\\" Muldoon is an orphaned boy with a love for puzzles and books, living in an orphanage in the metropolis of Stonetown with his tutor, Miss Perumal. Upon noticing an advertisement in a newspaper targeted towards gifted children, he follows up and finds himself presented with a series of complex puzzles and odd tests. He passes all of the tests set before him and qualifies to help Mr. Nicholas Benedict. He meets three other children who are each gifted in their own way: George \\"Sticky\\" Washington, Kate Wetherall, and Constance Contraire. Mr. Benedict, the organizer of the tests, is assisted by his subordinates Number Two, Rhonda Kazembe, and Milligan, the secret agent turned security guard for Benedict. They explain that a mysterious threat plagues the world in the form of secret messages transmitted into people's minds via television and radio signals. These messages have created the illusion of international panic known as \\"The Emergency\\". Mr. Benedict invited the children to form a team to stop the Sender, the individual sending the messages. The messages originate at the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened \\"L.I.V.E.\\" The children later decide to call themselves the Mysterious Benedict Society. Upon joining the Institute as students (and spies), the children discover that the school's principal Ledroptha Curtain is Mr. Benedict's long-lost twin brother. They also find that like the Emergency, the Institute relies on illusions like its pretentious lack of rules and nonsensical curriculum that can only be mastered by memorization. A hierarchy also exists among the student body: * Executives, the older students that run the Institute. * Messengers, the slightly younger students with \\"special privileges\\". * Recruiters, the adult \\"kidnappers\\" (later known as Ten Men). * Helpers, abducted amnesiac adults who do the grunt work around the school, such as cooking meals and cleaning dorms. Deducing that Messengers are the ones broadcasting the secret messages, Reynie and Sticky succeed in their lessons and become Messengers themselves. They help Kate and Constance cheat on their tests so they too succeed. Through their investigation, the children discover that Mr. Curtain transmits his messages through a device known as the Whisperer that interfaces directly with his brain. Mr. Curtain, after convincing the world that the Emergency exists, is preparing to tell the world that he alone can solve the problems. They also discover that this machine is capable of \\"sweeping away\\" memories. When the children learn that Milligan, who has been helping them behinds the scene, is kidnapped, and that Mr. Curtain plans to boost his messages to transmit directly to people's brains, The Mysterious Benedict Society concoct a daring plan. While Sticky and Reynie are in Mr. Curtain's office for their Messenger duties, Kate and Constance break in. Mr. Curtain attempts to wipe their memories, but Constance manages to resist him and confuse the Whisperer. At the same time, Mr. Benedict and his team enter the Institute just as Milligan breaks out of his prison through the underground sewers. Mr. Benedict manages to disable the Whisperer and the Society escapes from the island. Due to the Society's efforts, the Whisperer's mind-numbing messages cease. The Institute is raided by government agents and shut down, although Mr. Curtain manages to elude capture. Upon returning to Stonetown, the four children settle down and find families of their own. Characters =Main characters= *Reynard \\"Reynie\\" Muldoon is an eleven-year-old boy living at Stonetown Orphanage. He is talented at problem-solving, logical deduction, and perceiving people's emotions. His intelligence results in the assignment of a special tutor at the orphanage, Miss Perumal. Reynie looks between the lines, observing and questioning, and solves most problems by looking for a \\"puzzle\\" within the situation. He is described as an especially average-looking boy with average brown hair, average pale complexion, and average clothes. *George \\"Sticky\\" Washington, is an eleven-year-old, bald, tea-skinned boy. He has a great memory (everything \\"sticks\\" in his head, hence his nickname) and a talent for reading quickly. He is timid and nervous and resorts to polishing his glasses in stressful situations. He ran away from his parents because they forced him into academic competitions and he thought they no longer wanted him around. *Kate Wetherall is a twelve-year-old girl who is sporty, dexterous, strong, creative, cheerful and optimistic. After being orphaned, she ran away to the circus. She has blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. She carries a red bucket containing various items which she thinks are useful, including an army knife, a flashlight, a pen, a rope, a bag of marbles, a slingshot, a spool of clear fishing twine, a horseshoe magnet and a spyglass disguised as a kaleidoscope. Kate's mother died when she was a baby and believes her father left her (when she was young) because of her mother's tragic death. She loves to call herself, \\"the Great Kate Weather Machine\\". *Constance Contraire is a small, extremely intelligent, and stubborn girl. She has the ability to write clever and brutal poems, and her ultra-sensitive mind is most affected by the Whisperer. By the novel's end, she is also Mr. Benedict's adopted daughter and also reveals that she is only 2 years old. *Milligan is a former government agent and current guard for the children, Rhonda, Number Two, and Mr. Benedict. He is a sad and somber man, even described as a \\"scarecrow\\" due to his shabby and depressing demeanor. His sadness is attributed to his kidnapping by secret agents after which he was brainwashed and lost his memory. Although unsure of his actual name, \\"Milligan\\" was the first word he remembered on regaining consciousness, and he adopted it as his name. He later recovers his memory and remembers / discovers he is Kate's father. Milligan also has flax blond hair and ocean blue eyes. *Mr. Nicholas Benedict is a middle-aged man who recruits the children. He is the one who discovered the plans of his identical twin brother, Ledroptha Curtain, from whom he was separated just after birth because their parents had died. Mr. Benedict suffers from narcolepsy, which causes him to fall asleep when experiencing strong emotions (usually laughter). *Ledroptha Curtain is the antagonist of the story and the head of the \\"Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened\\", or L.I.V.E. and \\"The Emergency\\" are his tools for creating mass panic and destabilizing the world's major governments. Mr. Curtain created the mind- control and mind-message transmitter device called \\"the Whisperer\\", which utilizes children's minds to spread propaganda and subliminal messages through television as part of a scheme to usurp control of the entire world and be declared \\"Minister And Secretary of all the Earth's Regions\\" (M.A.S.T.E.R.). He is also revealed to be Mr. Benedict's long-lost twin brother. He uses a modified wheelchair to get around and wears mirrored sunglasses in order to conceal his narcolepsy. Mr. Curtain's narcolepsy is triggered by anger, as a foil to his twin's laughter-induced narcolepsy. =Supporting characters= *S.Q. Pedalian is an Eve working for Mr. Curtain. He is dim-witted and clumsy but is the only Executive who is kind to the Mysterious Benedict Society. He is also somewhat oblivious to the evils of Mr. Curtain, the Institute, and the Whisperer's effects on the world's inhabitants. *Jackson and Jillson are the Head Executives at the Institute and are noted for their unkind ways. Jackson has icy blue eyes, is stockily built, and has a nose long and sharp like a knife. Jillson is six feet tall, has small piggy eyes, and 'arms like a monkey *Martina Crowe is originally a Messenger and later Executive at the Institute. She despises the members of the Mysterious Benedict Society because she feels threatened by their intelligence, but holds particular enmity for Kate. *Miss Perumal is Reynie's tutor. She is Indian and is intelligent and friendly. She eventually adopts Reynie in the end. *Mr. Rutger is the Stonetown Orphanage director. Although not unkind, he is blinded by greed to Reynie's obvious higher educational needs. He gets paid for each student so he doesn't let Reynie go to an advanced school. *The Helpers make food, do laundry, and perform other manual labor tasks at the Institute. They are not allowed to talk to any students at L.I.V.E. or make eye contact. They share the same vacant, sad expressions as Milligan, and Reynie soon discovers that the Helpers may have been brought to the Institute against their wills and have been brainwashed. *The Recruiters kidnap children for the Institute, to be used for Mr. Curtain's Whisperer messages. In the following books The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey and The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma, they evolve into the Ten Men, so named for their ten ways of hurting people. *Number Two and Rhonda Kazembe are the over-protective assistants of Mr. Benedict. They have passed all his tests, and now do everything he asks them to do (except to let him stand up without at least one of them in the room). Rhonda is a Zambian woman who makes a convincing 12-year-old in height even though she's in her twenties. Number Two can mostly be noted for her resemblance of a pencil when wearing her yellow coat, with yellow skin and red hair.  Critical reception  The Mysterious Benedict Society has received generally positive reviews. Many critics praised the enigmatic plot and puzzles included in the storyline; journalist Michele Norris, writing for NPR, said, \\"Almost everything inside this book is an enigma.\\" Additionally, the ethical decisions and moral lessons contained within the book were praised. Kirkus Reviews said that the book was \\"rich in moral and ethical issues.\\" Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, wrote, \\"I enjoyed it very much -- great cast of characters, lots of cool puzzles and mysteries. The book made me feel nostalgic, because it reminded me of some of the better children‚Äôs books I grew up with, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Phantom Tollbooth.\\" Awards The Mysterious Benedict Society was a New York Times bestseller in 2008 and won a 2007 Booklist Editors' Choice: Books for Youth award, a 2008 Notable Children's Book for Middle Readers award from the American Library Association, the 2008 E.B.

He was an early practitioner of neuro- rehabilitation, advocating a regimen of special exercises for patients with neurological disorders.  Biography  He studied medicine at the Universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig, and was a student of neurologist Wilhelm Heinrich Erb (1840-1921). In 1884 he earned his degree at Leipzig, afterwards returning to Heiden to practice medicine. At Heiden he rented a house in \\"Cure Park\\" and filled it with specialized exercise equipment. Here he established a center of physical medicine and rehabilitation, where patients with neurological impairments could reinstate dexterity and improve mobility. Frenkel achieved great success with therapeutic exercises for cerebellar ataxia and ataxia. This success eventually attracted patients from all parts of Europe, and even America: see Frenkel Exercises. He was visited in Heiden by Rubens Hirschberg (1862‚Äì1920), who was an assistant to French neurologist Fulgence Raymond (1844‚Äì1910). Hirschberg was deeply impressed with Frenkel's work with neurological disorders, and on his return to Paris, convinced Raymond to establish a gymnasium in the neurology department at the Salp√©tri√©re. In addition, renowned neurosurgeon Otfrid Foerster (1873-1941) was greatly influenced by Frenkel's work and spent considerable time at Heiden. In 1896 Frenkel relocated to Berlin, where in 1913 he attained the title of professor. Here he served as head of the serological department at the clinic of psychiatry and neurology at Charit√© Hospital. He was the author of Die Therapie ataktischer Bewegungsst√∂rungen, a treatise on treatment of tabetic ataxia by means of systematic exercise and movement therapy. His name is associated with \\"Frenkel's symptom\\", which is defined as lowered muscular tonus in tabetic neurosyphilis.Mondofacto Dictionary definition of eponym Frenkel died in Dresden, Germany and his body was brought to Heiden, Switzerland for burial. His daughter Margerita Serena, called Rita, was born in Pallanza in 1891.

The spit is a long piece of land jutting out into Kachemak Bay. The spit is also home to the Homer Boat Harbor. The harbor contains both deep and shallow water docks and serves up to 1500 commercial and pleasure boats at its summer peak. Additional features and attractions include The Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon, which is an artificial \\"fishing hole\\", campgrounds, hotels, and restaurants and the Salty Dawg Saloon, which is constructed out of several historic buildings from Homer. Hundreds of eagles formerly gathered there in winter to be fed by Jean Keene, the \\"Eagle Lady\\". The Spit features the longest road into ocean waters in the entire world, taking up 10‚Äì15 minutes to cover by car. History Businesses on the spit are mostly on boardwalks Two different theories postulate that the spit originates either from the tidal swells and currents of Cook Inlet and Kachemak Bay over millennia of sand buildup, or that it was pushed into place by now-retreated glaciers. In 1899, the Cook Inlet Coal Fields Company laid a railroad track along the spit, connecting the docks to the coal fields along Kachemak Bay. The resulting business led to the development of what eventually became Homer, Alaska.Gannett, Henry. The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States. Bowie: Heritage Books, 1996. pg. 156 In the 1960s, several hippies, known as \\"spit rats\\", traveled from all around to camp on the Homer Spit, many of them becoming successful commercial fishermen over time.Wohlforth, Charles P. Frommer's Alaska 2005. Frommers:(November 2004). pg. 248 The 1964 Alaska earthquake shrank it to , and killed most of the vegetation, making it today mostly gravel and sand. Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon This artificial lagoon is known locally as the \\"fishing hole\\". Every spring it is stocked with salmon fry from the Trail Lakes hatchery facility. The fry are fed by volunteers so that they will imprint on the location in the normal manner of salmon. They then proceed to live normal lives as wild salmon, returning as adults to the lagoon due to their instinctual desire to mate and spawn. The lagoon is a popular attraction for both tourists and locals, as it is an easily accessible and inexpensive salmon fishery. There is even a ramp for those who have to use wheelchairs. During the summer months it can become very crowded if there is an active salmon run occurring, and there is additional competition from harbor seals who often enter the lagoon to chase salmon. The official name is a tribute to the biologist from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who proposed the idea and managed the project.news article on Nick Dudiak Potential threats The spit sits about above sea level, making it susceptible to storm surge. The United States Army Corps of Engineers have stated that a violent enough storm could generate waves of over . Tsunamis are also a known threat. An explosion from the nearby Augustine Volcano could bring a giant wave to the Spit within minutes, giving residents very little time to react. However, most tsunamis from other areas in the ocean would probably give Spit-dwellers enough time to get to safety, due to the early warning system operated by the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WC/ATWC) in Palmer, Alaska. Erosion of the Spit has also been a developing problem over the years, as the ocean side is exposed to heavy waves.Mason, Owen et al. Living with the Coast of Alaska.

The current head teacher is Rachel Evans. It became an academy on 1 June 2020, and will take on the new name The Heys School in September 2020. Chris Hornby was previously the deputy head teacher since 1999, taking over the headship at Easter 2013 on the retirement of Geoff Barlow who was Head since 2002. History The school opened as Heys Road School for Boys in 1936 and was used for treating wounded soldiers during the Second World War. It merged with Hope Park Girls' School, also in Prestwich, in 1979, becoming Prestwich High School. The new block was opened in 1981, and includes a sports hall, science rooms, and art and woodwork rooms. In 2002, a new humanities block was opened. The school later became Prestwich Community High School and, upon receiving specialist arts status in 2004, Prestwich Arts College. Throughout 2006, along with several other schools in the Bury borough, it had been under a sustained threat of closure. It was believed that there would be 2,000 fewer high school pupils in Bury by 2015, so Bury Council wanted to close two high schools in the borough. On 18 July 2007, the threat of closure was thrown out by the School's Organisation Committee.Inspection Report, Prestwich Arts College Ofsted, February 2007 Since then the number of students at the school has grown, and in 2010 the school underwent a major refurbishment, including provision of a new dining hall, Apple Creative Media Suite and an auditorium known as 'The Paragon' to support its performing arts status and which can be hired by external organisations outside of school hours. The school's close proximity to the Metrolink station means that it attracts many students from outside Prestwich/the Bury local authority, with sizeable numbers of pupils coming from Blackley, Crumpsall and Cheetham Hill in the Manchester Council area. As a result Ofsted described the school in its October 2014 Inspection Report as: > Prestwich Arts College is a smaller than average sized secondary school. The > proportions of students who are disadvantaged and therefore eligible for the > pupil premium is higher than average. (The pupil premium funding is > additional funding for those pupils eligible for free school meals and those > children who are looked after by the local authority.) Most students are > representative of minority ethnic groups and a much larger proportion than > seen nationally speak English as an additional language. A broadly average > proportion of disabled students and those with special educational needs are > supported at school action. The proportion supported by school action plus > or with a statement of educational needs is broadly average also. The school > meets the government‚Äôs floor standards, which are the minimum levels > expected for students' attainment and progress.Inspection Report, Prestwich > Arts College Ofsted, 2014, pg 3 As of 2019, the Ofsted rated the school as Inadequate with a part of the report saying: \\"This school has not provided pupils with a good quality of education for some time. A lack of urgency in tackling areas for improvement, coupled with weaknesses in governance, means that the school‚Äôs effectiveness has declined further since the previous inspection. Inadequate teaching has led to pupils‚Äô weak achievement across a range of subjects. The standard of education at Prestwich is not acceptable.\\" Since 2018, the school has severely under-performed. Behaviour continues to be poor and attainment (especially in maths) is well below national average. The gap is particularly bad for students who are generally high achievers. This has resulted in the school being forced to turn into an academy by mid 2020, despite an opposition campaign against the academisation being mounted by former student Joshua Harcup.

It is mainly used when referring to industrial or office space. History Flex space evolved from light industrial warehouses being converted to office space. Businesses that generally occupy these are new dotcoms, mechanic shops, and companies that contract plumbing, pest, electrical, and sometimes churches and related services. Companies have discovered that on any given work day, a large percentage of their cubes are unoccupied‚Äîin some cases, up to 50%. Employees travel for work, take vacation, or are working from home in greater numbers than ever before. To avoid having to lease or buy more office space, flex space allows a company to have a higher occupancy of cube space and less wasted work areas. At the beginning of the work day, an employee shows up at work. Cubes are mostly configured in the same way, making them all the same. The employee chooses a cube where they would like to sit, and that is their cube for the day. At the end of the day, they pack up their belongings, either taking them all home with them or storing them in a locker space. This leaves the cube the same way it was when they came in, and leaves it free and open for someone to use the following day. A large concern with employees in a flex space environment is cleanliness. It is important in a flex space environment to have a strong cleaning staff. Flex space describes mechanic shops as well. The Jim Bridger Building of Williston, North Dakota, USA is an example of a modern flex space mechanic shop. The Jim Bridger Building is designed to flex its use depending on the needs of the oilfield and agricultural industries of Western North Dakota.

Background Patsy was the last of a string of children born to an aging Czech mother in Paris, who gave birth \\"like a sprinkler, scattering bastard babies all over Europe.\\" In a flashback showing Patsy's birth, after telling an attendant to cut the cord, Patsy's mother exclaims that she names the child Eurydice Colette Clytemnestra Dido Bathsheba Rabelais Patricia Cocteau Stone. The only sibling seen in the series is her older sister Jackie (Kate O'Mara), a former high- class escort whom Patsy worships, despite the fact that Jackie treats her horribly and twice tried to murder her through heroin overdose. Patsy and Edina Monsoon were childhood friends, and since her mother despised and neglected her‚Äîregarding her more as a rival than a daughter‚Äîshe came to rely on the Monsoons for most of her shelter, comfort, and food (though she has only been seen eating twice since 1973). She mentioned that her mother would have had an abortion, but she mistook her pregnancy for the onset of the menopause. The first few years of her life were spent locked in a room, and the rest of her childhood was dismal by Patsy's own description, without friends, parties, or presents. Although her mother eventually sent her to school, by the time she did, Patsy was much older than all the other students. Although Patsy claims to have been an it girl and in-demand model in 1960s Swinging London, flashbacks reveal she was completely unsuccessful, only obtaining work through latching on to high-profile designers and models and manipulating them into feeling sorry for her. Flashbacks to the 1960s reveal Patsy wreaking havoc on the respective sets of Zandra Rhodes' and Annagret Tree's photo shoots. She dubs herself an \\"ex-Bond girl\\", but the films she starred in were actually Bond-inspired sexploitation films titled Bond Meets Black Emanuelle, Boldfinger and The Man with Thunder Balls. In \\"Schmoozin'\\", a group of partygoers are treated to a viewing of Patsy's 1970s softcore pornographic film Booberella. Patsy claims to have slept with every member of the Rolling Stones, stating that \\"...you didn't have a favourite Stone, you had 'em all.\\" She also claims to have slept with Keith Moon (\\"Well sort of. I woke up underneath him in a hotel room once.\\"), and one of the Beatles, although she cannot remember which one. On various occasions throughout the series, it is alluded to that Patsy was once transgender, having undergone a sex-change operation in Morocco in the 1960s. Edina states that this only lasted a few months, \\"before it fell off\\", and Elton John recognises her as someone he slept with when she was a man. In the series =Friendship with Edina= Patsy shares a codependent existence with Edina and often acts as her enabler, encouraging her to partake in addictive behaviours like smoking and drinking. The relationship usually results in hilarious, albeit dysfunctional, behaviour and over-the-top conflicts. The two usually spend their days shopping at high-end department stores and boutiques (Harvey Nichols being their favourite), going to lunch at trendy restaurants, and avoiding their respective work places. Patsy is more parasitic in her dependence than Edina is, she spends most of her spare time at Edina's house, drinks Edina's booze, uses her chauffeur-driven car, and at various points lives with her, in either the attic, Saffron's bedroom, or the utility room. In \\"Death\\", Patsy attempts to convince Edina to leave her her multimillion-pound Holland Park house in the event of Edina's death. Her dependence on the friendship leads Patsy to sabotage any relationships which take Edina's attention away from her, which is the root cause of her near-constant animosity towards Saffron. Patsy is also quite critical of Edina, often making passive jabs at her weight and poor fashion choices. =Appearance= Unlike Edina, Patsy is usually conservatively, but stylishly, dressed and almost invariably wears her hair in a characteristic blonde beehive with a fringe she is very attached to. She has a particular fondness for couture Chanel jackets, which she wears to editorial meetings to intimidate her colleagues. Patsy was born on 30 October, although her actual age is never clearly divulged; she often states herself to be between 39 and 43. She is so obsessed with projecting youth that she uses a false passport (obtained from \\"Johnny Fingers\\" on the Isle of Dogs) with a doctored picture from her modelling days. In \\"Cold Turkey\\", a nurse guesses that she is approximately 65 years old. In the episode series 3 \\"Happy New Year\\", Patsy's older sister Jackie reveals that she is 72 years old, to which Patsy replies, \\"My God, then how old does that make me?\\", suggesting that Patsy has lied about her age so often that she can no longer remember her real age. Her vanity and obsession with youth leads her to use radical beauty treatments, including sulfuric acid peels, collagen lip injections, and the Botox-like filler Parralox, which freezes wrinkles but paralyses her face. As the series progresses, Patsy betrays her age more and more, appearing to become more feeble beginning in the fourth series. In \\"Menopause\\", Patsy has to visit the hospital after fracturing her bones doing simple tasks, like snapping her fingers. The doctor diagnoses her with osteoporosis and declares that she has the lowest bone density on record. In \\"Olympics\\", she admits to using adult diapers for occasional incontinence. Her poor eyesight is evident, with Patsy often colliding with objects and having to scrutinize type and images very closely. =Personality= Patsy usually seems quite cold and unemotive, especially in her behaviour toward her chief rival Saffron, but she sometimes reveals a more vulnerable side (in flashbacks to her bleak life with her mother, in her overeager admiration for the awful Jackie, and in those rare moments when Edina temporarily withdraws her friendship) and even occasionally asks Saffron for advice. She is also prone to intense outbursts of anger, usually directed at Saffron, who constantly chastises her for her many vices and the malign influence she has on Edina. When faced with a situation that someone else might find alarming or disconcerting, Patsy often responds with a cool \\"right, cheers, thanks a lot.\\" Patsy is an alcoholic, a chain smoker, and a frequent recreational drug user. She carries drugs with her at all times, storing joints in her trademark beehive. She has nearly overdosed on several occasions, and on one occasion in the series has to have her stomach pumped after a rave-style drug binge in Edina's sitting room. In \\"France\\", she is detained at customs after being found carrying what immigration officers believed to have been cocaine, only to be released when tests show she mistakenly bought baking powder. In \\"Identity\\", she is revealed to have stiffed her former dealer, Barron, of ¬£50,000 worth of drugs, justifying her habit by saying, \\"Have you seen the price of methadone? Cheaper to buy crack.\\" Her drinks of choice are Bollinger champagne or Stolichnaya vodka, though she will drink whatever alcohol is around. She jokes that her blood-alcohol level is so high that \\"the last mosquito that bit me had to check into the Betty Ford Clinic.\\" In \\"Birth\\", she causes a fire in Edina's kitchen when she passes out with a lit cigarette. Her addiction to cigarettes is so strong that she carries nicotine patches in the event that she gets into a non-smoking cab, so that she can survive the journey. In the beginning of the series, Patsy is very promiscuous and frank about her sexuality, seducing anyone she finds attractive. When the fourth series commences, Patsy's attractiveness to men has begun to wane, though she refuses to admit this and still throws herself at men. Her obsession for staying thin means that she rarely eats; she claims that she has not eaten anything since 1973, having had a \\"stomach bypass\\", according to Edina. There are only two instances where she does eat: in the episode \\"New Year's Eve\\", she painfully chews and swallows a potato crisp, then is visibly shaken from having actually eaten something; and in the Christmas special \\"Cold Turkey\\", she renders the entire assembly speechless by demurely asking for a small slice of turkey during Christmas lunch, but chokes it up upon eating it. =Career= Throughout the first three series, Patsy is a fashion director at Ella, a magazine similar to Vogue, which she secured through sleeping with the publisher. Saffron derisively says that Patsy's job is to \\"invent random adjectives for pointless clothing.\\" Patsy rarely does any work or goes to the office (in \\"Magazine\\", she cannot remember where her office is located in the building and needs to ask directions). The benefits she most enjoys are the many free products she is given and the 50% discount she receives at Harvey Nichols. She refers to herself as an \\"international beauty and style guru\\", boasting that she is so influential that with \\"one snap of my fingers and I can raise hemlines so high that the world is your gynecologist.\\" In the series 3 episodes \\"Fear\\" and \\"The End\\", Patsy's magazine closes and she briefly moves to New York to take another fashion director job at HQ magazine. However, she is so lonely without Edina that she quickly returns to London. In part one of \\"The Last Shout\\", she is job-hunting, but ditches a job interview to go to the pub. In part two, her old boss Magda (Kathy Burke) gets her a job as fashion editor at another magazine, The A. In the 2002 special \\"Gay\\", Patsy has taken a job as \\"executive creative director, chief buyer and lifestyle coordinator\\" for Jeremy's, an upscale boutique whose clientele consists of \\"rich bitches whose faces are pulled so tight they can't see what they're buying\\". She also briefly attempts to become a celebrity stylist, which ends after a disastrous encounter with Minnie Driver. In \\"Birthin'\\", she is due to receive a \\"Global Style and Elegance\\" Award for promoting the importance of accessories, but fails to make the award show when Saffron goes into labour. In the 20th anniversary specials and the feature film, Patsy is once again working for a fashion magazine, under the direction of her old boss Magda. Patsy's colleagues at her original magazine are features editor Catriona (Helen Lederer) and beauty editor Fleur (Harriet Thorpe), who tag along on her various career moves. Significance For her portrayal of Patsy Stone, Lumley was nominated four different times for the BAFTA Award for Best Comedy Performance, winning in 1995. She also won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment in 1993, and a British Comedy Award the same year for best actress. The characters of Patsy and Edina Monsoon enjoy a significant following in the LGBT community and have long been favourite subjects for drag performances. Jennifer Saunders has described both Patsy and Edina as unconventional feminists, because \\"[i]t's never been about them finding a relationship, or defining themselves by having to have a man. They live life entirely on their own terms as women, and to be honest, men don't really affect them much. I mean, occasionally they want sex, but who doesn't? They're not defined by normality. They create their own normality.\\" References External links * Patsy Stone at the BBC Category:Absolutely Fabulous Category:British sitcom characters Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional cannabis users Category:Fictional characters who detransitioned Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Fictional criminals Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:Fictional LSD users Category:Fictional models Category:Fictional people from London Category:Fictional smokers Category:Fictional socialites Category:Narcissism in television Category:Television characters introduced in 1992 ","title":"Patsy Stone"},{"id":"9885222","text":"The Monastery of Dumio (sometimes Dumium or Dumio, in Portuguese S√£o Martinho de Dume), is a former paleo-Christian monastery in the civil parish of Dume, municipality of Braga, in northwestern Portugal. Originally a Roman villa, it was the base of a basilica by Suebi tribes, and later Christian monastery headed by Martin of Braga in the 6th century (c. 550‚Äì560). The re-discovery of the Roman ruins in the late 20th century resulted in archaeological excavations that unearthed its former use. History Martin of Braga and one of the Suevic kings of Galicia, Miro By the 1st century, there already existed an octagonal Roman villa, which, much later (3rd century) included a system of baths. In the first half of the 6th century, construction of a primitive church was ordered constructed by the Suebi King Chararic (Suebian king), to honour God for curing his son.Lu√≠s Fernando de Oliveira Fontes (1987), p. 125 It can also be inferred that this was a reflection of the expansion and authority of the Suebi within the northern context of Braga. By the middle of the 6th century, the site began to take on an important context within the peninsula. Under Martin of Braga, referred to as the Apostle of the Suebi, the older structures were taken over by a monastery, whose religious importance began to make it the centre of religion in the kingdom, and an autonomous diocese in close proximity to Braga.Lu√≠s Fernando de Oliveira Fontes (1987), p. 126 The King himself constructed a palace annex, making the ancient village a centre of decision-making in the Cortes. The design was also a combination of Suebi aesthetics and 6th century influences from southern Gaul; there existed semi-formal links to the Merovingian monarchs with whom the Suebi corresponded, showing artistic influences in the sarcophagus and layout of the basilica. Three centuries after the construction of S√£o Martinho, and during the Reconquista the basilica was the object of fundamental reforms. The church was transferred to the benevolence of the Bishop of Mondonedo, S√£o Rosendo (later confirmed in 911). Then, there was a return during the 10th century, with the re-purposing and re-population initiatives of Afonso III. Yet, by this time, the religious complex in Dume was abandoned (or at least in weak decline): neither the memory of Martin of Braga nor its ancient glory would motivate any new importance. It is likely that it may have served as a parochial church, but the ruins discovered on the site clearly indicate that it may not have lasted in this function for long. Dume was returned to the Diocese of Braga around 1103, where it remained, although later indications as to the condition, state or use of the ancient basilica are non-existent. In 1608, there were references to the hermitage of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, around the houses of the municipal seat. It was also around this time that the actual Matriz Church was completed (17th century). Later expansion of the church was completed in the first half of the 18th century. Around 1747, the Contador de Argote relates the appearance of diverse archaeological vestiges in Dume, casual objects unearthed by local farmers. However, it was only in 1987 that a formal identification of a Roman villa under the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio was completed; Lu√≠s O. Fontes, a professor at the department of archeology at the University of Minho detailed his findings in the civil parish. In 1992, formal excavations of the medieval funerary site was begun in Dume. By May 1993, the Roman baths of the Roman villa were discovered. The remains of Martin of Braga were moved to a subterranean tomb alongside the ruins, underneath the chapel. In 1997, the local government () erected a fence to protect the backyard of the Casa do Assento, whose archaeological structure corresponded to the Roman bathhouse was discovered. The beginning of the exploration of the uncovered paleo-Christian basilica were begun in July 2005. The collection of archaeological artefacts collected during the excavations were deposited with the Museu Dom Diogo de Sousa, in Braga.Lu√≠s Fernando de Oliveira Fontes (1987), p. 417‚Äì418Lu√≠s Fernando de Oliveira Fontes (1987), p.130 This included primarily ceramics from the Roman and medieval periods, but also Roman era glass and amphora, corroded medieval coins and decorative Roman mosaics. Also discovered: part of a lid of a sarcophagus, the base of columns, arches, fragments of stems, bows and staves, decorated with a herringbone rosettes and, slabs of limestone and marble that include traces of title and lattice grid. Architecture The vestiges of the basilica of Dumio unearthed during excavations around the Matriz Church in Dume The tomb of Martin of Braga The ruins are located around the Lugar da Igreja or Lugar do Assento on the square occupied by the parochial church of Dume.Lu√≠s Fernando de Oliveira Fontes (1987), p.114 Occupying a rural landscape, the space is an ample property that include the Church of S√£o Martinho de Dume, constituted by a central nucleus of the courtyard, the chapel of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio and backyard of the Casa do Assento, on the same block occupied by the local cemetery. The archaeological ruins in Dume encompass a complex of structures that include: a grande Roman villa (with a habitational zone) and bathhouse; remnants of a granite basilica in the form of a Latin cross (oriented east to west);Lu√≠s Fernando de Oliveira Fontes (1995), p. 417‚Äì418 with regularly horizontal aligned deposits in mortar, pavement and polychromatic mosaics; and a necropolis consisting of twelve graves, located in an area defined by granite slabs and/or brick coverage. These individual spaces were occupied successively over a 2000-year period.

Here‚Äôs a firsthand story about new life, it always starts at the bottom.\\" Music video =Release and making of= A music video for this song was filmed February 28, 2007 in Toronto, one of the stops on the band's Winter/Spring Tour.Daily Foot - 2/28 Toronto Brandon Dickerson (director of \\"You Already Take Me There\\" and \\"New Way to Be Human\\" videosBrandon Dickerson - director of \\"You Already Take Me There\\" and \\"New Way to Be Human\\" videos (retrieved 3/25)) directed the Awakening music video. It was released leaked, April 5 by the band's web content designer, Dale Manning on YouTube. The official release date for the music video was Tuesday, April 10. It premiered on the band's official YouTube account and on the website. The video is different from the band's previous videos because the video is not overtly related to the song or the meaning of the song. It is also different in the fact that the band funded the video out of their own pockets, without support from their record label. The creation of the video also was unique in the fact that Dickerson used a never-before-used technique dubbed \\"paper-mation.\\" Instead of using clay in the more common technique of \\"claymation,\\" the band employed paper print-outs of their performances, and were able to achieve the effect of animation. =Video plot= The Awakening music video mainly focuses on two men (Tony Hale and Adam Campbell), who first step out of an elevator and play a cardboard version of Guitar Hero in their apartments. As they play, they lip-synch the words to the song. Later on in the video, a woman (Jayma Mays) is seen playing Dance Dance Revolution along with the other two gamers. The only clips of the band playing the song in live action are shown early in the video as the guitars kick in. The band are later shown throughout the rest of the video as animated characters in a cardboard television. (Jon Foreman is seen playing Guitar Hero near the end of the video). Promotion Switchfoot's major label Columbia/SonyBMG put out very little support for the single. The video was completely funded by the band, with no help from the label, and by all accounts, the radio single was not promoted to radio stations at all. Whether this incident was the cause or not, Switchfoot and Sony parted ways shortly after the release of this single. In response to the lack of label-side support, the band's fans took it upon themselves to help promote the video in more of a grassroots marketing way. The website We're Awakening was originally created with the intent of promoting the song.

Ballistically - but not dimensionally - it is indistinguishable from the 9√ó56mm Mannlicher‚ÄìSchoenauer. It is currently regarded as a semi-obsolete calibre, although hand-loading keeps it alive. Performance Firing a relatively heavy bullet of approximately 14-16 g (220-250 grains) at a modest velocity of about 670‚Äì700 m/s (2,200-2,300 ft/s), the 9√ó57mm is low in noise and recoil, pleasant to shoot, and regarded as accurate and effective on all but the very largest, most dangerous game at distances out to 250‚Äì300 m (300-350 yd). The cartridge's low velocity combined with the heavy, poorly streamlined bullet gave the 9√ó57 a relatively poor trajectory, which made it unsuited to shooting at longer ranges. This calibre was popular as a large-deer cartridge in Germany and Central Europe; and also in German spheres of influence in Africa in the early 20th century, such as German West Africa and German East Africa, where it was widely popular among European farmers and settlers for shooting plains game. It also accounted for many lions and leopards. Its popularity was gradually eclipsed by the significantly more powerful, flatter-shooting 9.3 x 62 Mauser cartridge. The CIP Maximum Average Pressure (MAP) for the 9√ó57 is 280 MPa bar (40,600 PSI). Firearms using the 9√ó57 Many beautifully-made sporting rifles in 9√ó57mm caliber, often dating from well before 1939, are still giving their owners good service today. However, dependable, recently manufactured factory ammunition is increasingly expensive and hard to obtain, and many users must rely on handloading. Many of these Mauser rifles were made from de-militarized World War I small ring M98 rifles by many gunsmiths throughout Germany, and usually these are rebored (oversized from 7.92√ó57mm). When barrels eventually wear out, 9√ó57mm rifles are generally rebarrelled in other, more modern calibres. The cartridge was popular around the world and was even chambered in Remington Model 30 and Winchester Model 54 rifles. Commercial production The Eley-Kynoch 9√ó57 cartridge manufactured by the company at its Birmingham, England factory up to the 1950s used fully jacketed and soft-nosed, round- nosed, flat-based bullets weighing , with an average muzzle velocity of .

In the game, which many Stanford fans consider to be the revenge for \\"The Play\\" eight years earlier, Stanford trailed 25-18 late in the game. With 12 seconds left, Palumbis threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Ed McCaffrey to make the score 25-24. Stanford failed to convert the two-point conversion, and the Cal fans rushed the field, thinking the game to be all but over. Cal was penalized 15 yards for delay of the game while the field had to be cleared, and Stanford's Dan Byers recovered the ensuing onside kick. As Palumbis tried to get Stanford in field goal range, his pass to McCaffrey fell short, but a Cal defender was called for roughing Palumbis. Stanford kicker John Hopkins connected on a 39-yard field goal as time expired, giving Stanford the 27-25 victory.

The tip-speed ratio is related to efficiency, with the optimum varying with blade design. Higher tip speeds result in higher noise levels and require stronger blades due to larger centrifugal forces. :: \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{tip speed of blade}}{\\\\mbox{wind speed}} The tip speed of the blade can be calculated as \\\\omega times R, where \\\\omega is the rotational speed of the rotor in radians/second, and R is the rotor radius in metres. Therefore, we can also write: :: \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\\\text{R}}{v} where v is the wind speed in metres/second at the height of the blade hub.  Cp‚ÄìŒª curves  The power coefficient, C_p is a quantity that expresses what fraction of the power in the wind is being extracted by the wind turbine. It is generally assumed to be a function of both tip-speed ratio and pitch angle. Below is a plot of the variation of the power coefficient with variations in the tip-speed ratio when the pitch is held constant: center = The case for variable speed wind turbines = Originally, wind turbines were fixed speed. This has the benefit that the rotor speed in the generator is constant, thus the frequency of the AC voltage is fixed. This allows the wind turbine to be directly connected to a transmission system. However, from the figure above, we can see that the power coefficient is a function of the tip-speed ratio. By extension, the efficiency of the wind turbine is a function of the tip-speed ratio. Ideally, one would like to have a turbine operating at the maximum value of C_p at all wind speeds. This means that as the wind speed changes, the rotor speed must change to such that C_p = C_{p~max}. A wind turbine with a variable rotor speed is called a variable speed wind turbine. Whilst this does mean that the wind turbine operates at or close to C_{p~max} for a range of wind speeds, the frequency of the AC voltage generator will not be constant. This can be seen in the following equation: N = \\\\frac{120f}{P} where N is the rotor angular speed, f is the frequency of the AC voltage generated in the stator windings, P is the number of poles in the generator inside the nacelle. That is, direct connection to a transmission system for a variable speed is not permissible. What is required is a power converter which converts the signal generated by the turbine generator into DC and then converts that signal to an AC signal with the grid/transmission system frequency. = The case against variable speed wind turbines = As already mentioned, variable speed wind turbines cannot be directly connected to a transmission system. One of the drawbacks of this is that the inertia of the transmission system is reduced as more variable speed wind turbines are put online. This can result in more significant drops in the transmission system's voltage frequency in the event of the loss of a generating unit. Furthermore, variable speed wind turbines require power electronics, which increases the complexity of the turbine and introduces new sources of failures. It has also been suggested that additional energy capture achieved by comparing a variable speed wind turbine to a fixed speed wind turbine is approximately 2%.Dependence of performance of variable speed wind turbines on the turbulence, dynamics and control, Leithead References Category:Wind turbines Category:Engineering ratios ","title":"Tip-speed ratio"},{"id":"9885422","text":"Max John Kidd (born August 22, 1961 in Springfield, Illinois) is a former professional American football punter in the National Football League.

Early life Russell was born at Farningham, Kent, England, the youngest son of James Russell, a farmer, and his wife Ellen, n√©e Phillips. Russell was educated at Nassau school, Barnes, London, and then from 1878 at the medical school of King's College Hospital where he was a pupil of Joseph Lister'sRobert Yardley, 'Russell, Robert Hamilton (1860 - 1933)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 11, MUP, 1988, pp. 484‚Äì485. Retrieved 29 November 2009 eventually becoming the last of the house surgeons who worked under his personal guidance. Russell took the diploma of M.R.C.S. in 1882 and, after experience as a house surgeon at King's College hospital, went to Shrewsbury for two years as resident surgeon at the Royal Salop Infirmary 1884‚Äì85. Russell then studied in Continental Europe before returning to England in 1889 suffering a lung condition (possibly tuberculosis), and became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (London). Australia Russell went to Australia for the benefit of his health, arriving in 1890 and established himself at Hawthorn a suburb of Melbourne, as a general practitioner. Here he became doctor to the Grainger family and commenced a lifelong friendship with Percy Grainger. Russell was, however, anxious to do surgical work and in 1892 was appointed a member of the honorary staff of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. Russell became particularly interested in the problem of inguinal hernia in the young and read a paper on this subject at the intercolonial medical congress at Brisbane in 1899. This and other papers on allied subjects were published in The Lancet in 1899 and 1900. In 1901 Russell was appointed to the honorary surgical staff of The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne. In 1903 Russell was elected president of the Medical Society of Victoria, his presidential address was an exposition on \\"The Congenital Origin of Hernia\\", given in January 1904. His reputation as a surgeon was now established, and his papers in medical journals were giving him worldwide recognition; some particularly important and original work dealt with the treatment of fractures. Russell was in England when World War I broke out and did valuable work both in France and England in the earlier years of it. On his return to Australia he took up his work again at the Alfred and Children's hospitals, but resigned his Alfred hospital appointment in 1920 and five years later retired from the children's hospital. In 1920 he founded the Victorian Association of Surgeons. After his retirement he retained his interest in surgery and particularly in the foundation of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons at Melbourne. At the annual meeting of the fellows of that college in 1930 he was presented with his portrait by George Washington Lambert. He had been a member of the council from its inception, and at the time of his death was as censor-in-chief entrusted with the controlling of admissions to fellowship. In later years he suffered from osteoarthritis, became very lame, and was threatened with the loss of the sight of one of his eyes. This may have been a contributing cause of the accident by which he lost his life while driving a motor car on 30 April 1933. He never married, he was cremated and the remains returned to England. Legacy Russell was well-spoken and urbane, he was also an excellent pianist and had an appreciation of the best music; Percy Grainger recollected him as 'the first exquisite pianist in my life'. Russell was a fine surgeon and a remarkable clinical teacher. Every case was made the subject of careful, accurate and complete study, and every student was trained to think on surgical lines, always with the proviso that the recovery of the patient was the important thing. As a student of Lister he believed in the importance of the dressing of the wounds, and to go the rounds with him while he explained the reason for each method of application was an education in itself. Russell was not a believer in complicated methods of surgery and was always seeking the simplest way. He earned the affection and admiration of all his students, and his great ability made him a member of the small band of Australian medical men whose influence has been felt outside his own country. There is a bust of Russell by Paul Montford at the Alfred hospital, and an intermediate hospital block attached to the Alfred hospital has been named Hamilton Russell House in his memory.

These lakes include ice margin lakes or other types formed from glacial erosion or deposition. Sediments in the bedload and suspended load are carried into lakes and deposited. The bedload is deposited at the lake margin while the suspended load is deposited all over the lake bed. Bedload deposits Sediments carried in the bedload of a stream, mostly sands and gravels, are deposited in deltas that form at the edges of lakes. These deposits will only be found near the edges of the lake. Suspended deposits Sediments that are carried in the suspended load of a stream, commonly silts and clays, are transported into the lake in suspension or by currents along the lake floor. These are the principal deposits during the winter because of lack of melting of the glacier so the stream has a reduced discharge therefore carrying less coarse material. These sediments normally consist of fine-grained rhythmites that are laid down in layers known as varves or varvites. A varve represent an annual deposit of silt and clay. Sedimentation in deltas also occurs in rhythmic patterns as in the lake deposits, but they are thicker and contain coarse-grained materials instead of just silt and clay. As the varves get closer to the shoreline the clay layer will stay relatively the same thickness, but there will be an increase in thickness of the silt layer.

From 1914 to 1918 he worked as a free-lance artist, returning to newspapers in 1923 when he worked as a cartoonist in the New York Post for the Ledger Syndicate until 1931. He then found his permanent niche at the New York Daily News, where he worked until 1969. Batchelor's most famous editorial, published in 1936, reflected the newspaper's isolationist stance and won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. It depicted a prototypical \\"Any European Youth\\" greeted by a skull-faced harlot representing War, captioned \\"Come on in, I'll treat you right, I used to know your Daddy.\\" Sympathetic to women's suffrage, he contributed cartoons to Woman's Journal and The Woman Voter (which merged with the Journal in 1917).

Animation (though it used a Hanna-Barbera logo and copyright at the film's ending) which began in late 2006. It was dedicated to Iwao Takamoto, who died during the making of the film, with a September 4, 2007, release date for the DVD. It was the final direct-to-video Scooby-Doo film that Joseph Barbera was involved with (but was not dedicated to him; instead, Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale carried a dedication to him). Plot On a climbing expedition in the Himalayas, Professor Jeffries is led by his Sherpa, Pemba, to a high point on a mountain using an ancient tablet. Jeffries is out looking for the Abominable Snowman, who lives in the mountains. He's convinced that the Snowman lives close by, but Pemba tells him he won't lead Jeffries anymore, as it would be intruding on the territory of the Abominable Snowman. Jeffries, who seems to care about the Snowman over their safety, decides to cut the rope and continue. As soon as Jeffries fades from view, Pemba sees the outline of a large creature in front of him. Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne and Velma are on vacation in Paris. However, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy have not arrived yet, and the gang wonders where they are. Shaggy and Scooby are in a small plane that they think is going to Paris, but is really going to the Himalayas to drop off Alphonse LaFleur, a French hunter and trapper. LaFleur wants to find and kill the Snowman, and is taking Shaggy and Scooby along as bait. LaFleur then locks Shaggy and Scooby up with his equipment, and throws them off the plane. Shaggy, realizing they are not going to Paris, manages to get a quick phone call through to Fred before the phone goes dead. Fred uses the GPS on his phone to track them, and then he, Daphne and Velma head to the Himalayas to find them. Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby manage to land near a small village on the mountain, where Professor Jeffries and Pemba currently are. Jeffries tells Pemba he never should have left him, and that he almost died on the mountain. Many of the other villagers are leaving, fearing the creature and its wrath. Shaggy and Scooby go to the High Lama to ask for a phone to call their friends. The High Lama, a strange person, tells them there is only a phone on the weather station nearby. The High Lama is uneasy about letting them go in, but lets them. In the room is a statue of the Snowman holding a very large crystal, which the High Lama says it protects the villagers from the Abominable Snowman's powers. They then meet Pemba's sister Minga, who has decided to stay in the village. Minga constantly listens to the radio, and has a crush on the DJ from the station that she's listening to. Pemba tells her to leave the village, and he, Shaggy, Scooby and Jeffries (who says that everyone should stick together), decide to go to the weather station. LaFleur arrives, and decides to accompany them. As they travel, Minga runs up to them and says that she heard on the radio that a big storm is approaching. Shaggy wonders how there could be any radio reception so high up, and Pemba tells him there isn't, as it's just the weather station man pretending to be a DJ. Pemba realizes that Minga has a crush on the weatherman and deduces that she's just tagging along with them as an excuse to meet him. Minga denies this, and explains that there really is a storm coming. Everyone looks up and sees a dark cloud, and they decide to set up camp to wait out the storm. During the night, Jeffries gets out of his tent and leaves with his sled, which is filled with TNT and other explosives. Some time later, the Snowman attacks Shaggy and Scooby. LaFleur tries to capture the Snowman, but fails when all his traps backfire on the Snowman, instead working on him. Scooby and Shaggy manage to lose the Snowman but get lost themselves. However, they are relieved to see a snowplow approach them. In the snowplow is Del Chillman, whom the gang had met before. Del takes them to the weather station, where he works. Chillman tells them he decided to take the job so he could find out if the legend of the creature is true. He also reveals that he's the DJ/weatherman. He had the radio just to do weather reports, but plays songs to pass the time. Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne and Velma get to the village and see it is deserted. They follow Shaggy's tracks and see where the party camped the night before, and also the footprints of the Snowman. Velma notes that they are not very deep in the snow. They find Pemba, who was caught by one of LaFleur's traps. Minga is nowhere to be found and Jeffries is still gone, so the gang decides to split up and search for everyone else. At the weather station, Del goes out to look for the others. Once he leaves, the Snowman appears and attacks Shaggy and Scooby. As they run away, LaFleur shows up, tries to capture the creature, and struggles to save Shaggy and Scooby, but fails, and falls off a cliff, apparently to his death, or better yet whether he might have survived the fall. Scooby and Shaggy manage to escape and find their way to the lost kingdom of Shangri-La, but are pursued by the Snowman. Del catches up to the rest of the gang, but finds the weather station destroyed and some helium tanks missing. As Scooby and Shaggy walk around the city, the Abominable Snowman appears and chases them. Daphne and Pemba find a large cave and go inside, and conclude that is where the Snowman lives. They also find an empty helium case. Shaggy and Scooby lose the Snowman again, and everyone meets up in an old mine, each coming from a different direction. There, they see Jeffries mining for crystals like the one on the Yeti statue. They capture him and conclude he is the Snowman, although he denies it. Then the Snowman appears and chases everyone, while Jeffries gets free and follows them. The Snowman chases Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries down the mountain. Jeffries attempts to get the crystals in the mine cart that Scooby and Shaggy are riding in. The rest of the gang prepares a trap for the Snowman, but Shaggy, Scooby and Jeffries get caught in it. The High Lama comes out to see what happened. Then an avalanche starts, and almost crushes Velma and Del, but the Snowman saves them at the last moment. The Snowman is revealed to be Minga, who has been behind the mystery from the very beginning. She used the helium to fly, which caused the footprints to not be as deep. Minga confesses that she did it so that Del wouldn't stop broadcasting his radio show (also her way of admitting that she has feelings for Del). Del's touched by what Minga says, and finds it romantic. Jeffries is taken to jail because he was taking the crystals for his own gain. The gang wonders if there really is a Snowman, but then LaFleur appears and tells them that something saved him from his fall and brought him to the village (presumably the real Snowman). The gang, along with Del and Minga (who are now boyfriend and girlfriend), return to Paris for their vacation. Unfortunately, Fred gets on the wrong plane and ends up in the Amazon. The others go to find Fred, with Daphne complaining, \\"I'd like to have a vacation that actually stays a vacation.\\" Voice cast * Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo and Fred Jones * Casey Kasem as Shaggy Rogers * Mindy Cohn as Velma Dinkley * Grey DeLisle as Daphne Blake * James Sie as Pemba Sherpa * Jeff Bennett as Del Chillman and Pilot * Ren√© Auberjonois as Alphonse LaFleur * Alfred Molina as Professor Jeffries * Kim Mai Guest as Minga Sherpa * James Hong as The High Lama References External links * Category:2007 animated films Category:2007 films Category:2007 direct-to-video films Category:2000s American animated films Category:American comedy mystery films Category:American films Category:Films about cryptids Category:Warner Bros.

Playing as a centreman, Barrot was a best and fairest winner in 1965, an interstate representative and a major driving force behind the Tigers' 1967 grand final win. However, Barrot was prone to injury that limited his senior VFL appearances for the Tigers to just 120 in ten seasons. In 1971, Barrot was traded to St Kilda in exchange for Ian Stewart. Barrot never truly settled at Moorabbin Oval, managing just a couple of games, and later in the year he was traded to Carlton Football Club, where he finished his VFL career. In 1972 Barrot played for VFA side Oakleigh which had endured a lean time for more than a decade.

But STP is a DoD-wide organization. STP provides spaceflight via the International Space Station, piggybacks, secondary payloads and dedicated launch services.  Past activities  STP has actually been in existence for 50 years as of 2019, with several thousand launches it has been responsible for. For example, the initial experiments that led to the modern GPS satellite constellation were STP-launched projects. = 2001 = During August 2001 STP conducted two successful activities using the Shuttle and ISS. STS-105 delivered and successfully deployed the Materials International Space Station Experiment (Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE)) externally on the ISS. MISSE, a passive materials exposure experiment, is the first external experiment on ISS. In addition, STS-105 retrieved and returned MACE II (Middeck Active Control Experiment II) from the ISS. MACE II was the first experiment on ISS and was operated for nearly a year. On September 30, 2001, STP and NASA launched the Kodiak Star mission on an Athena I launch vehicle. This was the first orbital launch out of Kodiak Island, Alaska. In addition to NASA's Starshine III spacecraft, this mission included three small DoD spacecraft which tested a variety of new space technologies.NASA: Kodiak Star 2001 STP and the Air Force Research Laboratory‚Äôs Space Vehicles Directorate developed a secondary payload adapter ring for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), which can host up to six 400-pound micro satellites.

Their name means \\"broad belt\\" in Portuguese, referring to large bark sashes the tribe once wore. The tribe is famous for shadowing Theodore Roosevelt's Roosevelt‚ÄìRondon Scientific Expedition, making no contact. Language The Cinta Larga language is a Mond√© language, belonging to the Tupi language family. It is written in the Latin script. History Since the 1920s, the tribe has often come into violent conflict with prospectors entering the region to harvest rubber, timber, gold or diamonds. In the 1960s, this culminated in the \\"Massacre at 11th Parallel\\" in which rubber prospectors killed many of the Cinta Larga by throwing dynamite into their village from a plane, and then finishing off the survivors, including killing women and children with particular cruelty. Only two members of that Cinta Larga community survived the massacre. It is believed the plane made a first pass over the village, dropping sugar to lure a crowd to the central plaza. Then, it swooped in low to drop the dynamite on the assembled Cinta Larga. The bodies were buried in the riverbank, and that village was abandoned forever.The Unconquered: In Search of the Amazon's Lost Tribes, First Edition, Crown Publishers, United States, 2011, p. 227-228 Diamond mine controversy In 2004 the tribe was responsible for the murders of 29 miners illegally unearthing diamonds in the area.

Background and career Although Alexianus was a Roman citizen who was born and raised in Emesa (modern Homs, Syria), little is known on his origins. It has been assumed that Alexianus was born in c. 155.\\"Gaius Julius Avitus Alexianus\\" at Livius.org (last accessed 21 June 2020) What is known about him is from surviving inscriptional and Roman historical evidence. Through marriage he was a relation to the Royal family of Emesa and the ruling Severan dynasty of the Roman Empire. He was an Equestrian officerBirley, Septimius Severus: The African Emperor, p. 223 serving as a praefectus and tribune in the Roman military. Alexianus after served as a procurator of the food supply in Rome, being stationed in Ostia. Later he was promoted to the Senate by the Emperor Septimius Severus, his brother-in-law. Having entered the Senate with the rank of Praetor in 194, Alexianus was made Legatus in the Legio IV Flavia Felix and later served as governor of Raetia, which may be dated to 196/197. During his proconsulship of Raetia, he dedicated an altar to the Emesene God Elagabalus. The altar and its inscription, still intact, mentions him as a priest of the deified Emperor Titus. Alexianus served as consul in 200, even perhaps as early as 198 or 199. After his consulship, Alexianus was not appointed to further military or political positions, probably due to the enmity of the Praetorian prefect Gaius Fulvius Plautianus. After the death of Plautianus in 205, Alexianus took part in Septimius Severus‚Äô expedition in Britain where he acted as a Comes (Companion) to the emperor from 208 until 211. Under Septimius Severus‚Äô successor Caracalla, for two years Alexianus served as a Prefect of the Italian orphanages. He served as a Legatus in Dalmatia in c. 214 and later as a Proconsul in Asia and in Mesopotamia. In 216‚Äì217, Alexianus became a comes to Caracalla on his campaign against the Sassanid Empire. He died from old age on his way to Cyprus, sent there by Caracalla in early 217 to act as an advisor to the Governor. Marriage and issue Alexianus married the Syrian noblewoman Julia Maesa, the first daughter of Gaius Julius Bassianus, a high priest of the Temple of the Sun. The temple was dedicated to the Syrian Aramaic Sun God El-Gebal (counterpart to the Phoenician Baal) in Emesa. The younger sister of Maesa was Septimius Severus' empress Julia Domna, who was the mother of the emperors Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta. Maesa bore two distinguished daughters to Alexianus who were born and raised in Syria: * Julia Soaemias Bassiana (c. 180‚Äì222) * Julia Avita Mamaea (after 180‚Äì235) Among his grandchildren were the emperors Elagabalus (born as Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus) and Alexander Severus (born as Marcus Julius Gessius Bassianus Alexianus).

Early life Russell was born at Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, the second son of eleven children of Robert Russell, an engineer and ironfounder, and his wife Janet, n√©e Nicol. Peter was educated at Kirkcaldy Grammar School and was then employed in his father's business. Career in Australia The family emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in 1832, and in 1838 moved to Sydney. In 1842 Peter Russell left the family company at Pyrmont and leased 'The Sydney Foundry and Engineering Works' from the estate of James Blanch. In 1859, Peter re-united with his brothers George and John to form P. N. Russell and Company which became the largest and most successful business of its kind in Australia. In 1860 Peter Russell went to London and virtually retired, except that he acted as London representative of the business. In 1875 this was closed down after industrial unrest. Russell, however, had prospered with his investments, and was now a rich man. He retained his interest in Australia, paid several visits to it, and in 1896 made a gift of ¬£50,000 to the Sydney University to found an engineering school. In 1904 he made a second gift of ¬£50,000 to be devoted to the same department, with the proviso that the government should provide ¬£25,000 for buildings. Legacy Russell died childless in London on 10 July 1905, aged 89. He married in 1859 Charlotte, daughter of Dr Alexander Lorimer. Russell was knighted in 1904. Under his will a total sum of ¬£16,000 was left to various institutions and charities in Sydney. The engineering school at the University of Sydney is known as the 'Peter Nicol Russell School of Engineering', and there are three Peter Nicol Russell scholarships for mechanical engineering, and a medal for research work. His portrait by W. Q. Orchardson, R.A., is in the great hall, and there is a memorial group by Edgar Bertram Mackennal in the university grounds. Peter Nicol Russell's company, P. N.

Nassar contacted his lawyer F. Lee Bailey and informed him of this confession, which led to DeSalvo becoming the prime suspect in the unsolved Strangler murders.  Life  =Early life= Nassar was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the oldest of two children of Henry Nassar and Helen (n√©e George), both of Syriac descent. Henry had come to America with his parents as a child and worked at various mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He would pass away there in 1955. Helen was born in Dover, New Hampshire and worked as a bobbin setter in mills; a previous marriage (that ended in 1931) to a man named Lawrence Otis, yielded one son named after his father. Nassar has one sister named Eileen. Eileen and George grew up in Lawrence, and were Catholics. George was involved in sports, and was a Boy Scout. At school, his teachers found him reserved, quiet, and a poor mixer. =First murder= George first ran afoul of the law while he was in his sophomore year. In May 1948, he and two of his friends, Gennaro Pullino and William Kenney went on a robbery spree that netted eighty dollars. In one of the places they hit, shopowner Dominic Kirmil lunged at the trio with a Coke bottle; Nassar pulled out a nickel- plated revolver from his dark-colored trench coat and shot Kirmil four times. The shopkeeper died three hours later from the loss of blood. Several witnesses described Nassar's distinct trench coat to the police. On May 20, Nassar was picked up by Lawrence patrolmen Charles Keenan and Walter Sliva after crashing a stolen car on Route 2 in Ayer, Massachusetts. Initially charged with auto theft, Nassar soon became a prominent suspect in the Kirmil murder. The police found two thirty-eight-caliber bullets in his pocket, and the nickel-plated revolver used in the murder in the wrecked car. Nassar and his friends Pullino and Kenney were indicted and pleaded guilty to a second degree murder charge. They were formally sentenced to life in prison. Nassar was sent to the prison MCI-Norfolk in Norfolk, Massachusetts. Once there, Nassar formed a friendship with Unitarian minister William Moors and joined the Prison's Debating Society.http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2011-07/NorfolkPrisonDebateTeam.html Through the efforts of Moors, Nassar was paroled early in 1961. The Boston Strangler slayings would begin the following year. =Hilton's murder= On September 29, 1964, Nassar brutally murdered 44-year-old Texaco station owner Irvin Hilton in full view of Rita Buote and her 14-year-old daughter Diane. As Buote pulled in to the station, Nassar fired one shot into the kneeling Hilton, and three more after he crumpled to the floor. Then he approached Buote's car, and tried to get her to open up. Failing, he jumped into another car and drove off toward North Andover. A truck driver, William King, wrote down the plate number and called the police. The getaway car was found later that evening on a street in Andover next to Phillips Academy. The police soon learned that the car had been stolen earlier that day from near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. The car belonged to a navy lieutenant who was attending MIT. A thirty-two-caliber nickel-plated Harrington & Richardson revolver and a twenty-two caliber Astra semi-automatic pistol were found underneath the front seat of the car. Shells from the revolver were found at the crime scene and matched the bullets found in Hilton. An autopsy on Hilton revealed that he had been shot six times at close range, and stabbed in the back. The police theorized that the murderer had made Hilton beg for his life while shooting him. A description given by Rita and Diane Buote enabled Andover police officer William Tammany to draw a composite of the killer. On spotting the drawing, Nassar's former arresting officer Keenan was struck by its familiarity. He went through his files and came up with a photograph of Nassar, which the Buotes positively identified as the man they saw shooting Hilton. Nassar was found living in the Mattapan section of Boston. The Andover, Lawrence, and state police contacted the Boston police department, and got a warrant at Dorchester District Court to search the suspect's car and his apartment on 51 Deering Road. When the police arrived, they found Nassar with a social worker. A hunting knife was also located and confiscated. Nassar was subsequently arrested and sent to Bridgewater to await his trial. He was said to have schizophrenic tendencies and was put under observation when he met DeSalvo. On June 26, 1965, a jury found Nassar guilty of Hilton's murder, with no recommendation for mercy. He received the death sentence, and was placed on Death Row at Walpole State Prison pending appeal. On June 7, 1966, his sentence was struck down by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and later changed to life imprisonment. =Later life= Nassar was convicted in 1967 of murder in the first degree and that conviction was upheld following plenary or de novo review.Commonwealth v. Nassar, 354 Mass. 249, 237 N.E.2d 39 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1039, 89 S.Ct. 662, 21 L.Ed.2d 586 (1969). In 1982, Nassar filed an unsuccessful pro se motion for a new trial. When that motion was denied Nassar filed a one-sentence ‚Äúmotion for leave to appeal,‚Äù which was effectively abandoned. Nassar and other Massachusetts prisoners were transferred to federal custody in the summer of 1980. Nassar and seven other prisoners successfully challenged the transfers in a 1981 civil suit. Because the prisoners did not receive reclassification hearings and other procedures mandated by Massachusetts law, they were returned to Massachusetts custody.Blake v. Commissioner of Correction, 390 Mass. 537, 457 N.E.2d 281 (Mass. 1983). Nassar was being held in federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, as recently as 1983. Nassar is currently at Massachusetts Correctional Institution ‚Äì Shirley. After a twenty-year period, Nassar moved again for a new trial, which motion was denied. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in affirming the denial of the motion, wrote: ‚ÄúNassar claimed in his motion that he was unable, in 1983, to show good cause not to dismiss the matter because at that time, he was incarcerated in the Federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, without access to Massachusetts legal materials. However, he was returned to Massachusetts in December, 1983, but did not seek to reopen the matter or inquire as to its status at that time, or at any time thereafter for over twenty years. We perceive no error or abuse of discretion in declining to reopen the proceedings after such a long period of inaction.‚Äù Massachusetts v. Nassar, 450 Mass. 1031, 1032, 880 N.E.2d 793, 794-95 (Mass. 2008) Nassar's appeal was denied by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on February 15, 2008.Appeal denied for jailhouse confidant of reputed Boston Strangler.

The manor of Stanway was owned by Tewkesbury Abbey for 800 years then for 500 years by the Tracy family and their descendants, the Earls of Wemyss and March. Stanway House, originally constructed in the late 16th and early 17th century for the Tracy family, is a Grade I listed building. The principal rooms are in a long south-facing range forming an L-shape with the hall, unlike the usual Tudor house plan of a central hall. The north-east wing, remodelled in 1913 by Detmar Blow, was demolished in 1948. The kitchen court was designed by William Burn in 1859. The Gatehouse was built in about 1630. The construction includes Guiting Yellow stone and some Jacobean mullions and gables. The then Lord Neidpath, now the 13th Earl of Wemyss and March, has pursued a program of restoration for a number of years. The house and grounds are open to the public on a limited basis each summer.\\"Visitor Information\\" , Plan your visit to Stanway House & Fountain. Retrieved July 20, 2019. The estate The gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The estate brewery, an original Elizabethan feature has, with the permission of Lord Neidpath, recently been re-established. The Stanway House gatehouse Cutsdean Quarry, which is a nature reserve and designated a Key Wildlife Site (KWS) in the Cotswolds, is part of the Stanway Estate. J.M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, was a frequent visitor during summers in the 1920s, until 1932. The Long Canal was filled in around 1850 but was restored in the early 2000s, a necessary step to creating the current fountain, which was not an original feature of the estate. The mill pond was dredged and the eight ponds and the cascade were restored at about the same time. The ancient tithe barn was built in about 1370 for Tewkesbury Abbey and restored in 1927. The Estate watermill, just outside the grounds, has been restored to full working condition and produces wholemeal and sifted flour. Early history The current earl recounted his understanding of the history of the property during a 2016 interview with the publication Cotswold Homes, as follows: > \\"The estate goes back to 715, we think. It was given to Tewkesbury Abbey by > Odo and Dodo, two Saxons who lived in the Winchcombe area. Then in 1533 it > was leased to Richard Tracy. Richard had a bee in his bonnet about the fact > his father was declared to be a heretic after he was already dead, his body > being dug up and burnt. So he became friendly with Thomas Cromwell, who was > leading an anti-monastic campaign at the time. Cromwell ‚Äì who was so > powerful at that point - suggested the abbey lease the land to Richard and > it was done within four days of Cromwell writing the letter.\\" Records from 1291 indicate that the estate had three corn mills and a fulling mill used for processing wool from the many sheep owned by the abbey. The latter was converted in the late 17th century to grind corn and is now the Stanway Watermill. Another source states that the work on the House began around 1580 on the ruins of an earlier Tudor house, with construction commissioned by Paul Tracy, Richard Stacy's son. The triple-gabled Jacobean gateway was created by Paul's son, Sir Richard Tracy, in 1630. The water features were probably added by John Tracy who was the lord during 1724-35. The fountain The fountain Stanway House is also home to the Stanway Fountain, which was opened on 5 June 2004. The single-jet fountain, which rises to over , is the tallest fountain in Britain (seconded by Witley Court at ), the tallest gravity-fed fountain in the world (seconded by the Fountain of Fame at La Granja de San Ildefonso, Segovia, Spain at ), and the second tallest fountain in Europe, after the Jet d'Eau, a high turbine-driven fountain in Lake Geneva. The fountain has a bronze nozzle and is driven from a 100,000-gallon reservoir, above the canal in which it is situated. The reservoir is above the canal.

History The ferry, originally the Walnut Street Ferry and later the Jackson Street Ferry or Hudson Avenue Ferry, was established on December 1, 1817. The route originally connected Manhattan's Walnut Street (now called Jackson Street, just west of Corlear's Hook) with Brooklyn's Little Street (later named Jackson Street, just east of today's Hudson Avenue and west of the Brooklyn Navy Yard).Nathaniel Scudder Prime, A History of Long Island: from its first settlement by Europeans, to the year 1845, pages 376 to 380 At some point, the Manhattan landing was moved two blocks west, to Gouverneur Street, driving the name change to Gouverneur Street Ferry. Smith & Bulkley gained control by May 1852, and, effective May 23, 1853, the Brooklyn side was moved two blocks west, from Hudson Avenue to Bridge Street. Being unable to compete with the one-cent fare adopted by the Brooklyn Union Ferry Company in November 1850, it was sold to the new Union Ferry Company of Brooklyn (the successor to the Brooklyn Union) in December 1853. The lease expired on September 12, 1856, but the company continued to operate the ferry. They petitioned the City of New York to abandon the Roosevelt Street Ferry, in exchange for continuing Gouverneur Street operations and expanding the Manhattan landing. The city refused, and operations ended in January 1857. A new ferry, known as the Navy Yard Ferry or Hudson Avenue Ferry, was established on July 8, 1859 between Jackson Street in Manhattan and Hudson Avenue in Brooklyn, almost exactly where the original Walnut Street Ferry ran in 1817. The Hudson Avenue Railroad opened a streetcar line from the ferry to Prospect Park in late 1867.

He served as a rabbi for congregations in Indiana and Ohio. Cronbach was one of the founders of the Peace Heroes Memorial Society.American Jewish Archives: Abraham Cronbach Papers Early life and education Abraham Cronbach was born to German immigrants Marcus and Hannah (Itzig) Cronbach. Marcus was a notions store retailer in Indianapolis, Indiana, where Abraham grew up. \\"Abraham was an introspective boy, with a precocious and mystic conception of both God and the devil (he thought the devil was responsible for the smoke from the manhole in the street).\\"Vorspan, Albert. Giants of Justice. New York: Union of American Hebrew Congregations, 1960. He grew up in a Christian neighborhood where anti-Semitism and extreme poverty were common. He played violin as a boy as well as read a lot on religion and science. In high school Cronbach decided he would become a rabbi despite his parents' opposition. Cronbach entered the Hebrew Union College (HUC) in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1898 where, in conjunction with the University of Cincinnati he studied for his bachelor's degree and trained for the rabbinate. He graduated in 1902 from the University of Cincinnati and, in 1906 was valedictorian of his HUC class and was ordained as a rabbi. On October 7, 1917 Cronbach married Rose Hentel, a teacher at the Free Synagogue in New York City whom he met during his time there. In 1923 the Cronbachs adopted a daughter, Marion. Later Cronbach would become the teacher of rabbinic student, Maurice Davis who would become a leader in the anti-cult movement and Cronbach's son- in-law. Early career Rabbi Cronbach Early 1900s Cronbach first served as rabbi at the reform congregation of Temple Beth El in South Bend, Indiana. In 1911 he spent a year studying at the University of Cambridge in England and the Hochschule fur die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin. In 1915 he received the Doctor of Divinity degree from Hebrew Union College. After resigning his pulpit in South Bend in 1915 Cronbach spent three years devoting himself to the chaplaincy in prison and hospital installations. He developed strong convictions about the futility of the prison system. He eventually befriended Nathan Leopold. His interest in prisoners never faded and only increased his detestation of revenge and retribution and made Cronbach a strong opponent of capital punishment and the entire prison system. Cronbach spent the next seven years serving in three different rabbinical capacities: from 1915 and 1917 he worked with the Free Synagogue in New York City; from 1917 through 1919 he served as Rabbi at Temple Israel in Akron, Ohio;Temple Israel Akron, Ohio: Past Rabbis and from 1919 through 1922 he served as the institutional chaplain for the Chicago Federation of Synagogues. Lecturer and educator In December 1920, Cronbach delivered a series of lectures on chaplaincy procedures at Hebrew Union College (\\"The Ministry of the Jewish By- Ways.\\" Hebrew Union College Monthly, January - April, 1921). In 1922, Cronbach was appointed a professor of social studies at Hebrew Union College, where he remained for the rest of his life. While teaching at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cronbach participated in Cincinnati's Jewish Fellowship House and the Cincinnati Big Brother's Association. He was also an active member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now known as the Union for Reform Judaism). In 1939 Cronbach became secretary to the Board of Editors of the Hebrew Union College Annual. Pacifism and life during the World Wars =Early pacifist actions= As a result of World War I, Cronbach became an ardent pacifist. He helped found the Peace Heroes Memorial Society in 1923. The Society's national headquarters were located in Cincinnati. Cronbach served as national secretary and was instrumental in establishing Memorial Day services around the country in honor of the heroes of industry, maternity, pacifism, etc. These services were an annual event in Cincinnati from 1923 through 1941. Cronbach attempted to establish a specifically Jewish pacifist organization in 1924. A \\"Pledge for Jewish Pacifists\\" was sent out. Fifteen signed pledges were returned including ones from Max Heller and Jacob Weinstein however a formal organization never developed. Cronbach desisted from the project at the request of the College Board of Hebrew Union College who saw Cronbach as a public relations problem that was \\"too serious to be overlooked in the name of academic freedom.\\" =Controversy during World War II= With the threat and advent of World War II Cronbach's pacifist activities increased. Cronbach was familiar with controversy due to his pacifist beliefs. In 1935 he called for a conference between Nazis and Jews in Philadelphia for the purpose of reconciliation. During that same year he worked with the American Friends Service Committee to raise $5000 for an Austrian Relief Fund to aid persecuted Austrians, and German Jews and Nazis who had fled to Austria to escape Hitler's Germany.A Rabbi and the Rosenbergs by Dr. Frederic Krome March 29, 2005 =Jewish Peace Fellowship= In 1942 along with Rabbi Isidor Hoffman and Jane Evans, Cronbach established the Jewish Peace Fellowship,Jewish Peace Fellowship which caused a brief collision between Cronbach and the College Board of Hebrew Union College. The Jewish Peace Fellowship has had many prominent Jews as associates including Rabbi Leo Baeck, Albert Einstein, and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. For more than 50 years, Jewish Peace Fellowship has helped young Jewish conscientious objectors and is still active today. Cronbach has been quoted describing the fellowship as a =The impact of the Holocaust= Throughout the Holocaust Cronbach felt the weight of the suffering of the German Jews; he wore a \\"yellow badge\\", the yellow Star of David, sewn by his wife. At the end of the war when Cronbach's friend Rabbi Leo Baeck returned after being imprisoned in a concentration camp he and Cronbach exchanged their yellow stars; the one Baeck had been forced to wear as a sign of oppression and the one Cronbach willingly wore in support of his suffering brethren. Baeck's yellow star now resides with Cronbach's two grandsons. After the Allied victory of World War II Cronbach addressed letters to such Jewish organizations as the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Conference, and the American Jewish Congress asking that they not seek punishment of Nazi war criminals. =Views on Zionism= Cronbach was not dogmatic on the issue of Zionism but generally hewed to the views instilled by his Classical Reform training, and remained consistent in opposing Israeli militarism. He became active with the American Council for Judaism and was a revered member of its leadership until his death. Rosenbergs In 1952 Cronbach became a sponsor of the Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case and worked for the committee for the next two years. Cronbach carried on an active letter writing campaign that urged others to help secure clemency for the rosenbergs. \\"In May 1953, a Conference of Inquiry was held, sponsored by such people as Rabbi Abraham Cronbach and Mary Church Terrell on the national level.\\"Online Archive of California On June 16, 1953 Cronbach met with President Eisenhower to urge him to pardon the Rosenbergs. Cronbach compiled a book about his experience with the Rosenberg case.Michigan State University Libraries Cronbach appeared with Julius Rosenberg's mother and the Rosenbergs two small sons at a protest meeting in front of the White House after the Rosenbergs had been found guilty. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed at Sing Sing prison in New York on June 19, 1953, more than two years after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage. Cronbach gave a eulogy at the Rosenberg's funeral on June 21, 1953. \\"Rabbi Cronbach's impassioned eulogy [...] is an eloquent statement against excessive punishment and in favor of the positive synergy existing between American patriotism and Judaism.\\" Cronbach's eulogy for the Rosenbergs can be found in the Abraham Cronbach collection at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives. Later life Abraham and Rose In 1950 Cronbach retired from active teaching and became Emeritus Professor of Social Studies at Hebrew Union College. From then on he devoted most of his time to writing and published numerous articles and several books including \\"The Realities of Religion: A New Approach\\", \\"Stories Made of Bible Stories\\", \\"The Quest for Peace\\", and \\"The Bible and Our Social Outlook\\".Abraham Cronbach Books on Amazon Ohel Avraham Synagogue (formerly Cronbach Chapel) at The Leo Baeck Education Center in Haifa, Israel was named in honor of Cronbach by the National Federation of Temple Youth (now known as the North American Federation of Temple Youth or NFTY). Cronbach died in Cincinnati, Ohio. He is interred near his home in the Clifton neighborhood of Cincinnati. His wife was interred with him in 1982.

The present-day borders of Romania are projected to the historical map. Maramure»ô (in Romanian; Latin: Marmatia; ; ) is a historical region in the north of Transylvania, along the upper Tisa River. The territory of the southern part of this region is now in the Maramure»ô County in northern Romania, whereas its northern section is included in the Zakarpattia Oblast of western Ukraine.  Prehistory  intaglio lines and dots from Sighetu Marma»õiei, Maramure»ô County, Romania. There is evidence that the region of Maramure»ô was first settled in the Superior Paleolithic era. Archaeological discoveries of this primitive society have been uncovered in the Iza Valley near the village of NƒÉne»ôti. Remnants from a Neolithic culture were discovered in many regions of Maramure»ô. Artifacts were found around Sighetu-Marma»õiei, Costiui, Once»ôti, Corne»ôti and Giule»ôti. Some discoveries can be dated back to 6000 BC. Traces of Mesolithic settlements, approximately 7000 years old, have been found near the villages of Camianitsa and Dibrova (Ap»ôa de Jos) in Northern Maramure»ô and are considered among the oldest in Eastern Europe. Their inhabitants were hunter-gatherers, who lived during the winter in half-dug houses near the rivers and in the summer in aboveground huts. Using tools such as chisels, bows and arrows as well as harpoons, they worked stone and developed textured and glazed pottery and Ceramic. In a corner of their households they made clay kilns. The people of that period often moved their houses due to soil exhaustion. Cattle raising led to populating of mountain regions. The inhabitants of Maramure»ô from that period, together with those of nearby regions, belonged to the so-called Cri≈ü culture. Later, around 2000 BC, the migration of Indo-Europeans occurred. By the Bronze Age, the region of Maramure»ô was well settled, though due to the geography the population was quite sparse. Major archaeological discoveries have been found in more than twenty locations from the Bronze Age. This cultural establishment provides the first proof that the settlers of this region were of Geto-Dacian ancestry. During this time, the lands of Maramure»ô and much of modern Romania was the Kingdom of Dacia.  Antiquity  Map of Roman Dacia (106-207 AD) showing Costoboci and Free Dacians in the Maramure»ô region In antiquity, the region was governed by Thracian tribes, also known as Geto-Dacians. Around 300 BC - 200 BC, the migration of Celts brought Central Europe a more advanced technological culture. The second largest metallurgic center in Europe was located near Maramure»ô, at Galish-Lovachka, near the present town of Mukachevo. Apart from silver coins, over a thousand metal tools have been found there, such as scissors for cutting sheep wool scythes or swords and the remains of jewel workshops. The migration of the Celts also had negative effects. It gradually led to hostility between the Celts and the local Geto- Dacians. At the beginning of the 1st century BC, the latter, under King Burebista, defeated the Celts, forcing them to retreat to the territory of today's Germany. The Dacians during that period built their houses on higher banks of rivers, remains of which still exist at Cetatea (near Ocna Slatina). The salt from this town was also very valuable during that period. In 107, the Roman province of Dacia Superior was established, with an initial northern boundary along the Some»ô River, later to be moved further north. Maramure»ô became a region immediately adjacent to the Roman province. Roman coins have been found throughout the region, such as those at Nankovo (1000 Roman silver coins), Brestovo (25 golden coins), Ruske Pole and Gaidoshi. The salt mine at Ocna Slatina, the metallurgical center at Zatiseanski (Djacovo, Vovchanske), as well as the largest pottery district in Eastern Europe (on the river Mits) were all located in the region. Although the Roman administration retreated after 168 years, the Roman influence remained, due to the now linguistically Roman and ethnically Daco-Roman locals, who had become Christian. A great migration reached the region at the end of the 4th century, when Huns came to the Panonian plains. In the middle of the 5th century, the Huns formed a kingdom between the rivers Danube and Tisza under control of the legendary Attilla. In 453, Attilla was defeated by a Roman-Visigoth alliance under the Roman general Aetius and their kingdom disintegrated. Early Middle Ages Different tribes, such as the Gepids, Vandals, Burgundians, Ostrogoths, Lombards and Slavs moved through the region of Maramure»ô. Of these, only the Slavs have left a deeper trace, due to their higher number. At the end of the 7th century, the whole region was under the Avar khanate. Today, the population of Maramure»ô is linguistically and ethnically Vlach, mostly Vlach shepherds. Before the coming of the Hungarians in 896, little is known regarding political control over the area. The first groups of Slavs arrived nearby at the end of the 6th century, but they were not numerous. In the 8th century, however, a larger Slavic population followed. While some of the Slavs-Croatians soon migrated to the Balkan peninsula, those that remained populated the Pannonian territories immediately to the west of Maramure»ô. In the 9th century, the region bordered Velika Horvatia to the west and a small Slav dukedom, separating it from the much larger and stronger kingdom of Great Moravia. To the south, the region bordered the territory of Gelu, which was defeated in 904 by Hungarians. During this period, Slavs gradually converted to Christianity. In the 880s, disciples of Cyril and Methodius, expelled from Great Moravia, settled in the region immediately to the west of Maramure»ô and founded monasteries in inaccessible and beautiful mountain places. In 896, the Hungarians arrived under their leader √Ålmos through the Verecke Pass (the valley of the river Latoritsa). In 903, under Arpad, they conquered the fortresses of Ungv√°r. In the 11th century, the Kingdom of Hungary extended its borders into Transylvania up to the crests of the Carpathian mountains. As with most border areas of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages, this territory was purposefully left mostly unsettled as a deterrent to invaders: the territory is mentioned in chronicles of the time as part of the res nullis (no-man's land) or terra indagines (uninhabited defensive border land). The social organization of Maramure»ô during the Middle Ages was also very specific. The people in many mountain villages, where each family had a considerable domain, were called free peasants. In Romanian-speaking areas, these were called nƒÉme»ôi [nameshi] or free peasants. The Romanian term indicates belonging to a small clan, from the Romanian neam (bigger old family). This term has been preserved to this day, both in the areas that remained Romanian and in those which later gradually became Slavic. Hungarian and German terms also existed for similar circumstances in Hungarian and German-settled areas. In the 12th century, King G√©za II of Hungary invited Saxons (Germans) from the Rhine regions to settle there. Between the 12th and 15th centuries, Maramure»ô and surrounding areas were the source of an emigration. The mountain areas of present-day Ukraine, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic have been partly colonized by migrating groups of Vlach (Romanian) shepherds from further south. They were gradually assimilated into the Slavic populations, but sometimes strongly influenced the local culture. In the southeastern corner of modern Poland, where \\"lex vallachorum\\" was in force as late as the 16th century, or eastern Moravia, where their autonomy was devastated by Wallenstein during the Thirty Years' War. In March 1241, the Tatar-Mongols under the Khan Batu overwhelmed the mountain defenses and entered through the Verecke Pass (separating the county of Bereg from Galicia) to plunder Transylvania and the Kingdom of Hungary. They destroyed many towns and monasteries, killing up to half the population. Hungarian villages, being mostly in the valleys, bore the greatest brunt of the slaughter, and this helped start the decline in Hungarian population that influenced the modern political disposition of the territory. The Mongols destroyed the towns of Teceu (T√©cs≈ë then) and Ocna Slatina (Aknaszlatina then) as well as the surrounding villages. In 1242, they hastily retreated, after learning that the Great Khan had died, in order to back their leader Batu to become the new Great Khan. 1241‚Äì1526 In 1245, the Hungarian king B√©la IV invited grape- growers and wine-makers from Italy and Germany to settle in the places destroyed by the Tatars. Like other border regions, portions of Maramure»ô became a settled part of the Kingdom of Hungary later than other areas. The depopulated border regions began to be settled, in this case by both Vlach and native Hungarians, well after the Mongol Invasion of Batu Khan (1241). It was designated a county in 1303, and its territory reached the crest of the Carpathian Mountains. Prior to this time, it had been described only as (uninhabited) \\"forest.\\" In the 13th century, the nearby counties of Ung, Bereg and Ugocsa were temporarily ceded to the Halic-Volyn Principality, but returned to Hungary in 1308 under the new Anjou dynasty. The three counts - Petk of Ung, Kopasz of Bereg and Moish of Ugocsa - opposed the return to Hungary and restoration of the local population to the Catholic Church. They plotted to install Iuri, the son of Prince Lev Danilovich of Halic and the grandson of B√©la IV, as king of Hungary. But King Carol Robert of Anjou, with the help of the counts Drughezzi from Italy, prevailed. Anjou's military and diplomatic tenacity was soon to be tested by Maramure»ô as well. In the middle of the 14th century, the nobility of Maramaros, while still jealously guarding their rights at home, were an important catalyst in uniting the lands to the east of the Carpathian mountains and forming the Moldavian Principality. Nobles from Maramaros lent large numbers of knights (called 'vit√©z' in Hungarian) who were called and 'viteji' by the grateful Moldavians. This is the source of Moldavia's first and most famous dynasty, the Mu»ôatins. One of the major participants in these events was the count of Maramaros Bogdan of Cuhea, who succeeded in 1342 and again in 1349, in totally eliminating the royal authority from Maramure»ô, only to find his efforts thwarted by the superior diplomatic ability of King Louis of Hungary over the lesser local (Romanian) nobility. In 1349, documents mentioning \\"Ioan, son of Iuga, voevod of Romanians from Maramure»ô\\" and \\"Nicolae, son of Petru\\", addressed to king Louis of Anjou regarding the rights of a certain \\"Giula, son of Darius\\" over the villages of Giule»ôti and Nire≈ü.\\"Diplome Maramure»ôene\\", Maramure»ô, Sighet, 1900, p. 28 Bogdan's failure in Maramure»ô prompted him to remove his forces to Moldavia in June 1359. This left many of his villages with only defenseless peasants. In Moldavia, the arriving forces drove out Balc and Drag, grandsons of the legendary voevod Drago»ô, loyal vassals of the king of Hungary. As captains of the easternmost military mark, they had been organizing the defense against the Tatars on the eastern slopes of the Carpathians. When their reconciliation with Bogdan failed and the latter was able to gather sufficient support in Moldavia to gain independence both from Hungary and from Poland, Louis endowed Balc and Drag with the lands that Bogdan held in Maramure»ô and made them Voevods of the Vlachs, but this time vassals of the King. Documenting this in 1365, Louis ensured that the historic Kingdom of Hungary established its border along the crests of the Carpathians, a line preserved until the end of World War I. For over 30 years, Balc and Drag developed Maramure»ô, opening it economically and culturally to the outside world. They were sole administrators of over 30 villages. Most of them were in the northern half of Maramure»ô including the towns of Khust and Sighet and the salt mine at Slatina (the mine has been productive since pre-Roman times). For the rest of the Voevodate/County (both names were used throughout their reign in the 14th century) lesser lords were their vassals or name»ôi. Over the centuries, due mainly to wise diplomacy on the part of the Hungarian kings, Maramure»ô accepted its place as a county within the Kingdom of Hungary. The local nobility adopted the Hungarian language and intermarried with the Hungarian nobility from other regions of Transylvania, some of whom were actually of Romanian descent. In 1215, two monks, Romulus and Ghenadius, left the Monastery of R√¢me»õ (\\"Little Rome\\") in the Alba district in south Transylvania to found the Monastery of the Saint Archangel Michael of Peri. In 1391, the orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople Antonius IV transformed this monastery into a Partiarchal Stavropighia with jurisdiction over eight counties: Maramure»ô, Ugocsa, Bereg, Ung, √Årva, Ciceu, SƒÉlaj and Bihorian Alma»ô. Different sources mention two different people as the first bishop - \\"Simon the Moldavian\\" by some and \\"ehumen Pahonius, a relative of the voevods\\" by others. The bishopric became the earliest non-rural Romanian bishopric, after the bishoprics of Tomis and Durustorum, continued south of the Danube since Roman times. The monastery was the cultural and religious center of the northern half of Transylvania for over 300 years. Its monks produced the oldest known texts in the Romanian language (three different documents, apparently all written in 1391), as well as chronicles that served as sources for 17th and 18th century scholars of the Romanian renascence. In the 17th century, the monastery became an important typographic center. The monastery was burned down during an anti-Habsburg uprising of Hungarian Protestants in 1703, who retreated into the region and employed scorched earth tactics. The village of Peri (Grushevo) is situated on the right bank of the river Tisza, in what is today Northern Maramuresh, between Ap»ôa de Jos to the east, Teresva (also spelled Taras in older sources) to the west, Str√¢mtura to the north, all three currently in Ukraine and SƒÉp√¢n»õa, currently in Romania, to the south, on the opposite side of the river.Ethnically nowadays Ap»ôa de Jos and Stramtura are Romanian (basically 100%), Teresva is Ukrainian (over 90%), and Peri is mixed. The oldest document mentioning Sighet, the capital of Maramure»ô, dates to 1326.Emlekkonyv, Maramarossziget, 1892, p. 73 In 1334, papal lists mention a \\"Benedict, paroh of Sighet.\\"Documente privind Istoria Romaniei, vol. III, sec. XIII, Ed. Academiei, 1955, p. 248 In 1346, Benedict is mentioned as \\"rector eclesie Zygeth\\".Mihalyi de Ap»ôa, diplome Maramure»ôene, Maramure»ô Sziget, 1900, p. 23 In 1329, King Carol Robert gave the status of seats of \\"royal guests\\" to four towns of Maramure»ô: Visk, Khust, Teceu and Campulung. On 19 February 1352, King Louis I extended these urban privileges to Sighet.V. Belay, Maramoros megye tarsadalma es nemzetisegei, Budapest, 1943, p. 25 In 1385, the city of Sighet is mentioned as \\"county siege, where documents are emitted\\",I. Mihalyi, Diplome, ... p. 85 and in 1397, a document of the Drago»ô family mentions \\"villa noastra libera ... Zyget\\".I. Mihalyi, Diplome, p. 114 The towns of Hust and Teceu also gained in importance during that time. Masons, tailors, bakers, carpenters, barbers, potters, smiths, goldsmiths and cartwrighters are mentioned. In 1472, a diploma of Matei Corvin reaffirms the urban privileges of Sighet.Mihalyi, Diplome, p. 516 Many of the larger villages of Maramure»ô date from the same period: Slatina (1360), Ap»ôa de Jos (1387), Ap»ôa de Mijloc (1406) and Biserica Alba (1373). At the end of the 15th century, there were 128 towns and villages in Maramure»ô (compared with 205 in nearby Ung, 122 in Bereg and 76 in Ugocsa). The combined population in 1500 is estimated by historians at 30,000 to 60,000. Many villages are mentioned in the 15th century as name»ôi villages, i.e. inhabited by free peasants: Lipcia, Iza, Dolha, Dragova, Bedevlea, V√¢»ôcova, Vilihivtsi, Criceva, Ciumaleva, Uglea, Colodne, Vonigova in the north V√¢»ôcova is even mentioned as a town sometimes. In 1514, the uprising of the cross-curutz peasants under Derdi Doji conquered Hust, the \\"gate of Maramure»ô\\", but did not encroach further into the region. 1526‚Äì1690 In 1526, at the Battle of Moh√°cs, Hungary was defeated by the Ottomans and King Lajos II, the last of the Jagiellon dynasty, died in battle. Most of the Pannonian plains were subsequently occupied by Turks and the western and northern Kingdom of Hungary passed to the Austrian Habsburgs, while Transylvania, including Maramure»ô, became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire from 1541. Petru Rare»ô of Moldavia attempted to take the area over in 1527-1538 and later Mihai Viteazul of Wallachia tried the same in 1600‚Äì1601. Most notably, the Austrian Habsburgs tried it for the whole duration of the autonomous principality (1527) until they finally absorbed it in 1687. In 1551, Sighet's rights to hold fairs were reaffirmed.Arhivele Statului, fond Prefectura Jud. Maramure»ô, Actele prezidentiale ale Vicecomitetului nr. 86/1888 Also in 1551, the first ever strike in the Kingdom of Hungary took place, when the miners of Ocna Slatina left their workplace and created a makeshift tent camp at Baia Mare, demanding improvement of their working conditions and annulment of the death penalty. In the 16th century, Lutheran and Reformed Calvinist movements took hold in Transylvania, especially among the Hungarian nobility. In 1556, the Catholic Church in Sighet, together with the majority of believers, was taken over by the Protestants. Later they also opened a confessional school there. With the help of Transylvanian Saxons, a Romanian Orthodox monk from Moldavia printed the first Romanian language text entitled \\"the Lutheran Catechism\\" in 1544. During the 1550s and 1560s, a whole series of propaganda appeared. On November 30, 1566, the Protestant-dominated Sibiu Diet decided to \\"extirpate the idolatry, especially from among the Romanian peasants\\". During the reigns of the Zapolai princes in 1526-1571 over different parts of the disintegrating Kingdom of Hungary, the Protestant nobility of Transylvania and the Catholic Austria often clashed, with the latter slowly gaining the upper hand. The pro- independence policy of the Romanian gentry and Hungarian nobility provoked an Ottoman invasion in 1566. The principality was plundered, but its remote location saved Maramure»ô. The region was similarly protected from the devastations during and in the aftermath of the 1604-1606 and 1678-1685 Hungarian anti-Habsburg uprisings. The 16th and 17th centuries also saw the rise of haiduc movements - self-organized small detachments that attacked the rich and distributed the bounty among the poor. From the 16th century, with the consent of the Hungarian nobility and later with that of the Habsburgs, the mountain regions separating Panonia from Galicia were subject to the Galician colonization: Lemki settled in the Ung, Zempeln and Saros counties, Boiki - in Bereg and Ung, while Hutsuls - in northeastern Maramure»ô. The period from the end of the 15th century to end of the 18th century also saw the gradual migration of Ruthenians from Bereg to the northwest of Maramure»ô, mostly by intermarriage with local Vlachs. In 1611, Emperor Leopold of Austria allowed Sighet to have its own coat-of-arms: an Aurochs' head. In the 17th century, the Romanian Orthodox Church of Transylvania was moved by the Diet to the jurisdiction of the Reformed (Calvinist) Church. A Calvinist superintendent was named on April 9, 1639 to oversee the conversion of Romanians from Orthodoxy to Calvinism. Many leaders of the Romanian Church (which opposed these moves) such as the metropolitans Dosoftei, Ghenadie II, Ilie Iorest and Sava Br√¢ncovici (the latter two were later canonized by the Romanian Orthodox Church) were persecuted, imprisoned or sometimes killed by the Transylvanian governments of princes, such as Gabriel Bethlen or Georgy Rakoczi. In 1641, the Ruthenian Orthodox Bishop of Munkach in Bereg, the region immediately to the west of Maramure»ô, converted to Catholicism. On April 24, 1646, 63 Ruthenian Orthodox clerics from nearby Ung, Bereg and Ugocsa counties proclaimed the Uzhhorod Union with Catholicism, founding the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic Church. In 1689, Pope Alexander VIII officially recognized the union. This led to open conflict with B√°thory princes, who were Reformed Protestants. In 1689‚Äì1706, the Catholic Bishop of Munkach was a Greek, Iosif Camillis, who managed to take over some Orthodox parishes in northern Transylvania and obtained authority among others over some parts of Maramure»ô, especially over the largely Ruthenian villages of the region. In total, 140 Ruthenian and Romanian parishes were under the authority of the Bishop of Munkach. Later, in 1853, the Romanian ones separated and formed the Bishopric of Gherla. The Romanian bishops of Maramure»ô, together with the monks of the Maramure»ô hermitages (\\"schituri\\"), trying to preserve orthodoxy, started a revival movement aimed at the local priests and at the population. Their aim was to uphold \\"that the language, traditions and religious we hold link us with neighboring Moldavia.\\" To counterbalance the Catholic proselytism, the Romanian clergy of Maramure»ô elected Iosif Stoica from Criciova, a widowed priest who became a monk, then bishop. He was raised to this rank in 1690 by the metropolitan Dosoftei of Moldavia. An antimis (religious text), dated by Iosif Stoica in 1692 and preserved to this day, is signed \\"din mila lui Dumnezeu, Episcop Ortodox al Maramure»ôului, exarh al Stavropighiei Patriarhale Constantinopolitane, loc»õiitor al Mitropoliei din B√¢lgrad din Ardeal\\", the title of the Bishopric of Peri. Stoica is known to have travelled throughout the region, often to Khust. The Hungarian historian Nicolae Bethlen, former chancellor of Transylvania during that period, has noted that Iosif Stoica wrote a letter opposing union with the Roman Church, based on arguments from the Scriptures and the writings of the Church fathers. Bethlen noted his surprise that a rural Romanian was able to produce \\"a letter of such theological strength.\\" After serving as bishop for 15 years, Iosif Stoica was forced to sign a 20-point program in 1705. It imposed strong restrictions to orthodoxy and to the Romanian character of the faith. However, when Iosif Stoica refused to sign, he was arrested and imprisoned in Khust, allegedly with the support of Iosif Camillis, who wanted to name as vicar of Sighet a Catholic, Gheorghe Ghenadie Bizanezi. The priests and parishioners of Maramure»ô protested in vain, demanding the release of their Bishop. They elected a new Bishop, Iov »ö√¢rca from G√¢mbu≈£, who after a few years of persecutions and accusations fled to Moldavia. He was then condemned to death for his activities in defending the Church. After being released in 1711, Iosif Stoica continued to exercise his episcopal functions without the knowledge of the authorities. He tried to recover his bishopric officially, but died in the same year. For his piety and activities in defending the traditional Romanian faith, he was revered by the believers from Maramure»ô along with the saints, and later, in 1992, the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him. His saint's day is April 24. The next bishop, »òtefan Serafim Petrovan, was a person easily swayed. He was ready to turn to Catholicism, but was prevented in this by the Calvinist Hungarian nobility. Romanian-Orthodox sources claim that the attempt to convert the Maramure»ô Romanians to Catholicism \\"were met with dignified and solemn protests against being united against their will and against introduction of innovations contradicting their old law and beliefs.\\"Ovidiu Ghitta, Na»ôterea unei Biserici, Presa UniversitarƒÉ ClujeanƒÉ 2001, In the 17th century, Maramure»ô became renowned for the so- called \\"girl fairs\\" (\\"t√¢rguri de fete\\") where, in addition to activities common to classical fairs, people gathered to meet and marry. Due to extensive cutting of woods, by 1631 the cutting of fir trees for cork to transport the salt was limited. At the same time, nuts, apples, mulberries, corn and clover became sources of revenue. Maramure»ô also became renowned for its wood and iron works - Visk, Criva, Bu»ôtina, Bocicoiu Mare, furnaces and casting - Kosivska Poliana, Butfalva, timber - FrƒÉsini, Bocicoiu Mare, Gura Ciornei, shoe factories - Khust. Cliff caves were used to heat mineral water, creating the first spas. The towns of Visk, Teceu, Khust and others remained owned by the county government, unlike the surrounding regions, where many towns and cities became private property or central state property. 1690‚Äì1918 The last incursion of the Ottomans into Central Europe proved disastrous to them. In 1683, the Austrians and the Poles defeated the Ottomans at the gates of Vienna. Within seven years, they also conquered Buda, Transylvania and abolished the principality. In 1699, in the Treaty of Karlovitz, the Ottomans officially renounced Transylvania in favour of Austria. In Transylvania, Catholic and Protestant efforts to convert the population resulted in open clashes. Concurrently, the Transylvanian nobility was becoming Magyarized, a process virtually completed by the 16th century, when Calvinism was adopted. After granting autonomy to Catholics Szekely and new Lutherans Saxons, the nobility formed with them \\"The Union of The Three Nations\\", a statute aimed at concentrating all the power in the principality in the hands of the three nations: Hungarian (Calvinist nobles), (Catholic) Szekelies and (Lutheran) Saxons. (Orthodox) Romanians, representing the vast majority of the population, were left with no representation, except the voice they could have through their clergy. Understanding that the religious pressure from all sides would not cease, a part of the Romanian-Orthodox clergy prepared to compromise with the side that would prove more flexible to the needs of the Romanians. Linguistic and cultural affinities, as well as the much greater flexibility shown by the Catholic Church paid off for the latter. In 1692, Orthodox Bishop Teofil Seremi was established as the Metropolitan of Alba Iulia, as usual under the Calvin dependency. After discussions and negotiations through the Jesuit Ladislau Baranyi, Seremi convoked a synod. On March 21, 1697, the synod decided to unite the Church with Rome under the conditions of the Council of Florence, similarly to the unions of Brest and Muncach of the Ruthenians. The intention was that the Romanian clergy would receive the same rights and immunities as the Latin clergy, while preserving the traditional establishments and the mass. On April 4, 1697, the imperial chancellor Franz Ulrich Kinsky presented the Romanians' request to the governor of Transylvania Georgy B√°nffy in Vienna and the imperial approval of the document. The Church was left under existing Calvinist control. Teofil Seremi died in July 1697, presumably by poisoning. The ambiguity of the situation at the time was emphasized by the next Metropolitan of Transylvania, Atanasie Anghel. He received his ordination as Orthodox Metropolitan of Bucharest, where prince Constantin Brancoveanu of Wallachia had arranged for official instruction to be given to the new metropolitan by Dositei, the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. As soon as the Catholics started to realize the promised concessions, the 1697 union gained strength. In response to the July 2, 1698 confirmation of the 1697 privileges by Cardinal Kollonich of Esztergom, Atanasie Anghel summoned a new synod, which passed a \\"Manifest of Union\\" on October 7, 1698, signed by 38 high representatives of the Romanian clergy of Transylvania. In 1700, Brancoveanu presented the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan of Alba Iulia with a substantial financial contribution which he retracted the next year, after a new synod in 1700 validated the union. In 1701, Anghel travelled to Vienna and declared the Metropolitan province of Transylvania was no longer subordinate to Bucharest. Dositei, the Patriarch of Jerusalem and Teodosie, the Metropolitan of Bucharest, presented Anghel with a formal anathema. In 1700, the Maramure»ô county congregation decided that the parochial school at Sighet had to be supported with public money. In 1703, there was a Hungarian uprising against Austria and Catholicism, led by Ferenc Rakoczi. Some Romanians, Ruthenians and Slovaks participated. On June 7, 1703 the kuruc won an inconclusive battle against Austrians at Dolha, but were subsequently defeated, although definitively only in 1711. During this uprising, the Hungarian Protestants plundered and destroyed the famous Monastery of Peri in 1703. After the union, Anghel's difficulties continued. The Calvin intendant was replaced by a Jesuit theologist, Gabriel Hevenessi, whose aggressiveness and absence of diplomacy, according to contemporaries, were surpassed only by his zeal to censure the books printed at Alba Iulia. The support from Wallachia was now completely cut. Due to the Hungarian revolt, the support from Vienna was minimal. In 1707, Rakoczy occupied Alba Iulia and Anghel had to retreat with the imperial troops to Sibiu. In Alba Iulia, the Bishop of Maramure»ô Iov Tarca, the former counter-candidate of Atanasie Anghel for the metropolitan see, re-established the Romanian Orthodox metropolitan province of Transylvania, with himself as Metropolitan, but was forced to flee to Maramure»ô, when the city passed again into Austrian hands. In 1711, Atanasie Anghel, frustrated by the absence of imperial support, again voided the union with Rome, but was dissuaded by the Jesuits, when they finally managed to obtain support from the Emperor. Anghel died in 1713, but it took until December 23, 1715 until the Emperor approved another bishop, Ioan Giurgiu Patachi. Simultaneously, due to major reconstruction in Alba Iulia and resulting demolition of many old buildings, the metropolitan see was moved to FƒÉgƒÉra»ô. After approval by a papal decree \\"Indulgentum esse\\" (1716) and papal bull \\"Rationi Congruit\\" (1721), Patachi was festively installed in his position at the \\"St. Nicolas\\" Cathedral in Fagara»ô on August 17, 1723. In 1717, the Tatars invaded Maramure»ô and plundered the wealth of Sighet, much of which was hidden in the reformed church. After bringing much disaster, the Tatars were annihilated in a battle at Cavnic, where a monument was erected to commemorate the battle. Also, commemorating the battle, a traditional costume is worn during the Christmas period, when the battle was fought, known today under the name of Brondosi. The adversaries of the Greek-Catholic Church inside the imperial territory were the Protestant nobility of Transylvania, but also the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan of Karlowitz. The latter's emissary to Transylvania, the Romanian monk Visarion Sarai, succeeded in spontaneously gathering so much support among the locals that it terrified the Austrian authorities. After arresting him, they sent him to the fearful Kufstein prison in Tirol, where he vanished. The person who was instrumental in establishing the national right of Romanians in Transylvania and forming the union with Rome was the Romanian Greek-Catholic Bishop of Blaj Inocen»õiu Micu-Klein. Schooled by the Jesuits in Cluj, trained in theology in Trnava and later a Basilian monk, he was appointed in 1729 by Emperor Charles VI Bishop of Alba Iulia and Fagara»ô. He was also awarded the titles of Imperial Counsellor and Baron as well as given a seat in the Transylvanian Diet. In 1737, he moved the bishopric seat from FƒÉgƒÉra»ô to Blaj and in 1741 laid the foundations of the local cathedral. As a member of the Diet, Micu began to press the Habsburg monarchy to fulfill the agreement that conversion to Greek Catholicism would bring with it privileges such as were accorded Roman Catholics and an end to serfdom. First pressing for rights for the clergy and the converts, he soon began to petition for freedom for all Romanians. Micu petitioned the Habsburg court for over forty years to this end. His perseverance ultimately caused both Empress Maria Theresa and the Transylvanian Diet to declare themselves offended. The Diet itself opposed the liberation of the work force or the awarding of political rights to Romanians, considered by the Diet as \\"moth for the cloth.\\" Exiled in 1744 and forced to give up his bishopric in 1751, Micu died in Rome in 1768. A visit by the Catholic Bishop Manuil Olsavszky of Muncach, travelling as official envoy of Empress Maria Theresa throughout Transylvania, revealed that the union was in name only and that the locals did not want to receive uniate priests, but demanded that Klein be brought back. Fearing the situation could get much worse, Maria Theresa produced an Edict of Tolerance towards the Orthodox believers on July 13, 1759. It forbade the uniate clergy to persecute them. Two petitions were sent in March 1791 and March 1792 by the leaders of the ethnic Romanians of Transylvania to Emperor Leopold II, demanding equal political rights with the other ethnicities of Transylvania and a share of the Transylvanian Diet proportional to their population (two third). Partially modelled on revolutionary France Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the Supplex Libellus Valachorum Transsilvaniae (Petition of the Vlachs of Transylvania) documents were drafted by clerics of the Romanians Greek Catholic Church. Rejected, except for the point referring to the free practice of the Orthodox faith, despite the quasi- total support by the population, the document became the rallying point of the Romanians of Transylvania until after World War I. In the 18th century, Maramure»ô was known for the export of salt, fur, wine and wooden crafts, while importing jewelry, carpets (from Turkey and the Balkans), fabric, crystal, china (from Bohemia, Germany and Italy) and iron crafts (from Holland and Poland). Bu»ôtina, Veliky Bicichiv, V√¢»ôcova, Teceu, Hust, Rahau, Ocna Slatina, Taras, Yasinia, Dolha, Bor»ôa and Sighet were the regional towns that emerged during that period. Hust was hosting as many as ten annual fairs. The 19th century brought economic growth to Maramure»ô, although the first factories had appeared two centuries earlier. Electricity, post and telephone service reached the region by the end of the century. During 1870‚Äì1913, there was considerable migration to the USA. From Maramure»ô, Ugocea, Bereg and Ung combined, there were 180,000 legal and up to 400,000 illegal emigrants to the USA. A smaller number of people emigrated to Uruguay, Canada, Argentina and Australia. In 1900, Ioan Mihalyi de Ap»ôa printed the first volume of the history of the County of Maramure»ô, \\"Maramure»ô Diplomas of XIV ‚Äì XV centuries\\", at Sighet. With the beginning of World War I, Russian troops invaded Yasinea and Rahiv in northeastern Maramure»ô in September 1914. They were repelled, but at the end of October 1914, while pushing towards Uzhoc, they invaded also the northeast-most villages of Maramure»ô, around Studene and were again repelled. No further military action took place in Maramure»ô. November 1918‚ÄìMarch 1919 At the end of World War I, the Austria-Hungary empire dissolved. The nations comprising it elected national and/or regional assemblies to determine future political configurations. At this time, Maramure»ô County was divided into North and South. The National Assembly of the Romanians of (inner) Transylvania, Cri»ôana, Banat and Maramure»ô, composed of 1228 elected members, has decided on December 1, 1918 in Alba Iulia upon their union with Romania. On December 15, 1918, in Media»ô, the Council of the Transylvanian Saxons and Danubian Swabians (ethnic Germans that had moved to Transylvania in the 12th-13th, respectively in the 18th centuries) decided to support the Romanians, mainly because of their adversity to the prospect of having to live in a Hungarian national state, which was due to the Magyarization policy practiced in the Transleithanian part of Austria-Hungary after 1870 up to World War I. The remaining Hungarians (24%-26% of population of Transylvania) as a whole were opposed to this move, claiming to be best represented by the Transleithanian Government in Budapest. Southern Maramure»ô, as well as Romanian villages from the north of the river Tisza, around the town of Ocna Slatina, elected deputies to the Romanian Assembly. In November and December 1918, various \\"Councils\\" were established in different cities of Carpathian Ruthenia, the region inhabited by Ruthenians, spanning over most parts of the former counties of Ung, Bereg, Ugocea and the northern part of Maramure»ô, in order for inhabitants to decide which state they wished to join. Uzhhorod, Mukachevo, Berehovo and other cities voted to join the new Hungarian Republic. On January 21, 1919, Khust and Svalyava I did not find the date for Svalyava voted to join Ukraine-Russia. A Hutsul Republic was declared in Yasinia on January 8, 1919. A vote was taken by the National Council of American Ruthenians, in which Czechoslovakia won as the most popular home for the region. This vote served as a basis point for the proposals of the Triple Entente regarding the future of Carpathian Ruthenia. The Czechoslovak delegation at the Conference of the Treaty of Versailles insisted that the northern half of Maramure»ô be combined with Carpathian Ruthenia, based on the fact that the August 17, 1916 Treaty (article 4) between Romania and the powers of the Entante (Britain, France, Russia and Italy) precluding the entrance of Romania in World War I, stipulated Romania's right to Austria- Hungarian territory inhabited by Romanians up to the river Tisza. The Romanian delegation was opposed to this because the river Tisza divided Maramure»ô County roughly in half and the Romanians inhabiting the right bank of the Tisza had also taken part in the election of representatives to the Assembly of Alba Iulia.Northern Maramure»ô Participation in the Romanian National Council that adopted 1 December 1918 union On the 26 May 1918, the Romanian National Council of the Northern Maramure»ô was formed under Dr. Vasile Chindri»ô as president and Prof. Ion Bil»õiu-DƒÉncu»ô as secretary. Lt. Florentin Bil»õiu-DƒÉncu»ô was appointed chief of the local unit of the Romanian National Guards. In the autumn of 1918, elections were held throughout Transylvania for the Romanian National Council (Great Assembly) of Transylvania to be held in Alba Iulia, which was to consist of 600 representatives elected five each from the Austro-Hungarian electoral districts and 628 as representatives of different social organizations (clergy, teachers, officers and soldiers, etc.) On 27 November 1918, the representatives of the towns and villages of the Sighet electoral district held their session in Slatina. These included from the right bank of the river Tisza: 20 representatives from Ap»ôa de Jos (and surrounding villages), 20 from Ap»ôa de Mijloc (and surrounding villages), 10 from Slatina and 10 from Biserica AlbƒÉ. The session elected Dr. Titu Doro»ô as chairman and Ion Bil»õiu-DƒÉncu»ô as secretary. Since the villages to the north of the Tisza were appointed two seats in the Alba Iulia Council only after the votes were counted, the two people elected were Dan Mihai from Ap»ôa de Mijloc and Filip Ilie from Ap»ôa de Jos. Three other delegates represented Northern Maramure»ô at the Council as representatives of different social organizations: N. Nedeliu, a priest from Biserica AlbƒÉ, for county clergy, Florentin Bil»õiu- DƒÉncu»ô from Slatina for the Romanian National Guards of the county and Ioan Silliu-DƒÉncu»ô from Slatina, representing \\"Reuniunea invƒÉ»õƒÉtorilor rom√¢ni din comitatul Maramure»ô\\" (\\"The union of the Romanian teachers of the Maramure»ô County\\"). The following is a reproduction of the original document in Romanian: 1918, 14/27 noiembrie, Sat-Slatina (cercul electoral Sighet) Proces- verbal luat in adunarea electorala a cercului electoral Sighet din comitatul Maramuras, tinuta in Sat-Slatina, la 27 Novembrie 1918 Prezident Dr. Titu Doros, Notar Ion Biltiu Dancus.

These MPs voiced concern during the Assembly upon the incorrect usage of the phrase \\"up to Tisza\\" by some speakers as a figure of speech and were assured that de jure the Assembly was representing the population of the administrative units of Austria-Hungary from which they had been elected. After prolonged negotiations at the Conference of the Treaty of Versailles, the Romanian delegation convinced the Triple Entente powers to accept the decision of the Assembly. The Romanian Army subsequently moved into Transylvania during the spring and summer of 1919. Four independent field Commissions, one each from Britain, France, USA and Italy, submitted proposals for the future border of Romania in Transylvania. The consolidated proposal suggested that the westernmost Counties (parts of Cri»ôana/Partium) be retained by Hungary and one County in the southwest (part of Banat) to be attributed to the newly formed Yugoslavia. March 1919‚ÄìApril 1920 An ambiguous period ensued from March to May 1919 as a \\"Diet\\" government for Carpathian Ruthenia formed with strong ties to Hungary's B√©la Kun (communist) regime. Throughout the summer of 1919, Czech troops began to control most of what is today Carpathian Ruthenia, with Romanian troops gaining control of its southern regions in late spring at the request of the Versailles Conference, against the Communist Hungarian Republic. In June 1919, independently from the ongoing events in Versailles, the Romanian and Czechoslovak armies agreed on a demarcation line which left Ung and most of the Bereg County under Czechoslovak control, while Maramure»ô, Ugocsa and part of the Bereg County fell under Romanian control, until the final decisions at Versailles were made. On July 2, 1919, the Prime Minister of Romania, Ion C. BrƒÉtianu, withdrew from the Versailles Conference because the Entente powers wanted to stick to the letter of the 1916 treaty with respect to Maramure»ô, i.e. to divide the county. This created tension between the Romanian Delegation and the Supreme Council at Versailles. On August 3, 1919, the Entente powers finally accepted the Czechoslovak suggestion. BrƒÉtianu refused to sign the treaty in that form. The Romanians wanted to preserve the June demarcation line as the official border. In Transylvania, there was some public anxiety about keeping Maramure»ô County intact. The Prefect of Maramure»ô, who kept the administration over the entire County, was very outspoken. Maramure»ô and Ugocsa elected members to the new Romanian parliament in 1919, with a wide participation in the vote among both Romanians and Ruthenians. The elected MPs were of both ethnic groups. They engaged in a series of attempts to wake the political class and the public opinion to what they called \\"the cause of the over-Tisza lands.\\" The Saint-Germain agreement of September 10, 1919 between Entente and Czechoslovakia provided for the incorporation of the majority of Carpathian Ruthenia into Slovakia as an autonomous unit of the Slovak portion of the Czechoslovak state. In Romania, the BrƒÉtianu Government resigned on September 12, 1919 and a new government led by Vaitoianu was formed. A member of that government, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, previously a famous Transylvanian politician in former Austria-Hungary, compiled a documented \\"proposition about the boundary of Maramure»ô, to include all Romanian villages\\", suggesting \\"a line that would start west of Teceu and would continue to the north along mountain crests to the Galician border, leaving in Romania in addition to the south, the entire subdistrict of Sighet, the subdistricts of Tisza and Taras and half of the subdistrict of Teceu.\\" On September 30, 1919, Vaiatoianu was replaced by Vaida himself. Vaida was appointed to the Romanian Delegation in Versailles as an expert in the question of Maramure»ô by one of the new MPs from that County, Dr G Iuga. The latter presented many documents in support of the argument about \\"the obvious Romanian rights over Maramure»ô.\\" He used the example of the oldest Romanian Bishopric, established in the village of Peri in 1391, on the northern side of the river, which has been for over 300 years the main center of Romanian culture in the northern half of Transylvania. Czech-Romanian negotiations in 1919‚Äì1920 On December 1, 1919, the Romanian Parliament formed a new Vaida Government as a result of the parliamentary elections in Romania. Vaida had been Austro-Hungarian politician and as a result the relations between the Czech and the Romanian delegations in Versailles eased and the Conference took a more favorable view towards Romania. On December 16, 1919, in a speech to the Romanian Parliament, Vaida said that he was hopeful in finding a solution \\"to save the entire Maramure»ô.\\" After negotiations, the Czech Delegation started accepting the Romanian point of view. On March 15, 1920, the chief of the Czech Delegation to Versailles, ≈†tefan Osusk√Ω, informed Vaida that the Maramure»ô border \\"is to be settled in short time.\\" The agreement reached by the Romanian and Czech delegations left the entire Maramure»ô, except the Dolha sub-district, to Romania. In return, the Czechs demanded a military alliance. The agreement was to be signed in London, where the whole conference moved. Yet another government was formed in Bucharest, this time not led by a Transylvanian, but by General Averescu. The agricultural reform envisioned by Vaida-Voevod deeply upset and threatened the wealthiest land owners and businessmen from pre-1918 Romania, who set aside their infighting to concentrate on the threat posed by Vaida. Of the 16 million inhabitants of Romania in 1920, only seven million lived in the pre-1918 territories. This threatened the pre-1918 political class, which was more feudal, conservative and anti-democratic than the politicians that formerly lived in Austria-Hungary or in the Russian Empire. Another faction that played a key role in the deposition of Vaida was Bratianu, who feared possible inquiries about the misuse of funds by his government before Romania entered World War I in 1916. Averescu assured Bratianu that any possible inquiries would be persecuted. The Czechoslovak delegation took this opportunity to change its tone and refused to sign the documents on the grounds that the new Romanian government was not legitimate and could not sign agreements as the previous regime had. On April 1, 1920, the Czech representative in Bucharest reaffirmed the Czechoslovak government's request that the Romanian troops leave the territory up to the Tisza line, informing the Romanian government that it \\"agrees to negotiate in the future a rectification of the boundary following propositions from a mixed Czech- Romanian border Commission to be formed.\\" On April 18, 1920, the Romanian Government of General Averescu announced to the Czechs that the army would retreat to the requested line. This reply, implemented at the end of July 1920, created the impression in diplomatic circles that Romanians renounced the territory of Maramure»ô north of the river Tisza. The Romanian perspective had been given a crushing blow with this hasty withdrawal of troops, a blow against the natural geographic configuration and vital economic interests of the region, without any consent and against the categorical will of the affected Romanian population. On June 4, 1920, Romania signed the Treaty of Trianon and the international community recognized the border in northern Transylvania as it is today. The mixed Czech-Romanian commission was never formed. 1920‚Äì1938 After the Treaty of Trianon was concluded in 1920, Northern Maramure»ô became part of Subcarpathian Rus region of Slovakia, one of the component states of Czechoslovakia. In 1920, there were 60 newspapers edited in the Subcarpathian Rus, the region that apart from northern Maramure»ô also contained Ung, Bereg and Ugocsa: 22 in Hungarian, ten in Russian, nine in Rusyn, five in Hebrew, four in Czech, four in Ukrainian and six mixed. No newspaper was published in Romanian. 1938‚Äì1944 Prior and during World War II, Hungary, led by Mikl√≥s Horthy, allied itself with Nazi Germany in the hope of re-obtaining some of the territories it had lost under the Treaty of Trianon. On October 1, 1938 the First Vienna Award came into force. It was a direct result of the Munich Agreement. Czechoslovakia was forced by Germany and Italy to cede the Sudetenland (a part of the Czech Republic mostly inhabited by ethnic Germans) to the Third Reich. On October 6 and October 8, 1938, Slovakia and Subcarpathian-Ruthenia respectively gained autonomy. Then, Germany and Italy arbitrated the 2 November Vienna Protocol, allocating a strip of territory from southern Slovakia (approximately one third of Slovakia) and Subcarpathian-Ruthenia to Hungary. The resumption of Hungarian control over these territories was not an entirely peaceful process. Invited by Germany and Italy, Poland invaded and annexed the Teschen area in Moravia. Nevertheless, Romania refused to invade and annex the compactly Romanian part of Northern Maramure»ô. The remaining Slovak territory became officially autonomous and had the right to its own parliament and government with Monsignor Jozef Tiso chosen as its leader. However, it did not become fully independent from Czechoslovakia until an ultimatum given by Hitler prompted a vote for \\"independence\\" (as a puppet state for Hitler) on March 14, 1939. The next day, on March 15, 1939, Germany annexed the remainder of Czechoslovakia as the \\"Reichsprotektorat\\" of Bohemia and Moravia. Subcarpathian-Ruthenia declared its independence in Khust under President Augustin Voloshin, but was invaded and annexed by Hungary the following day. On March 23, Hungary started an invasion from the Subcarpathian-Ruthenia and occupied additional portions of eastern Slovakia, but later returned them to Slovakia. The Subcarpathian- Ruthenian land allocated to Hungary as part of the Vienna Protocol (November 2, 1938) Award included the region's largest cities: Uzhhorod, Mukachevo, Berehovo and Chop. Khust, in the East, the westernmost city of Northern Maramure»ô, remained a part of Subcarpathia-Ruthenia and the seat of its government moved there. The Chust government actively continued to voice complaints over the fate of the western Subcarpathian-Ruthenian territories and vocally asserted the region's case for its own government and the protection of its former lands. The Chust declarations increasingly included a possible attachment to an independent Ukraine. The day after the Slovak vote for independence from Czechoslovakia on March 14, 1939, the Ruthenian Diet led by Premier Augustin Voloshin declared independence for Subcarpathian-Ruthenian under the name \\"Carpatho-Ukraine.\\" Within 24 hours, Hungarian troops invaded Chust with the assent of Hitler. They liquidated the government and annexed the remainder of Subcarpathian-Ruthenian to Hungary. In addition, the southern part of the Maramure»ô region was occupied by Hungary between 1940-1944 after the Second Vienna Award during World War II. 1944‚Äì1991 Northern Maramure»ô as part of the Zakarpattia Oblast of Ukraine Ethnic map of the Transcarpathia Region (Oblast) in 2001. Legend: At the end of 1944, the war touched Northern Maramure»ô. On October 18, 1944, Russian troops occupied the villages of Biserica Alba, Apsa de Mijloc and Ocna Slatina and on October 19 Apsa de Jos. On October 23, they created \\"people's committees\\" in these villages and on November 26, 1944, a \\"Congress of people's committees\\" was held in Mukachevo. It was to adopt a \\"Manifest of Union of Transcarpathia with the Soviet Ukraine.\\" Someone using the name I.M. Lemaninet purported to represent Apsa de Jos at this Congress, although a person with this name has never been known before or after in the village. However, the official union of Subcarpathian- Ruthenian/Trans-Carpathia with the USSR was formalized in Moscow on June 29, 1945. After that, the Soviet Army organized the \\"election\\" of \\"presidents of people's committees.\\" These were N.I. Guzo in Apsa de Mijloc, V.T. Popsa in Biserica Alba, Gh. Guban in Slatina and M.M. Filip in Apsa de Jos. One of the first acts of the Soviet administration was to change the historic names of the villages. Apsa de Jos became Dibrova, Apsa de Mijloc became Srednee Vodianoe, Ocna Slatina became Solotvino and Biserica Alba becameBila Tserkva. The names of the smaller villages were also changed. Collectivization brought a lot of resistance from the local population. After the creation of the first kolkhoz in the village of Apsa de Jos, the biggest village of the Trans- Carpathian region, the locals killed Ivan Chernichko, the president of the kolkhoz. As a result, 21 men were sentenced to a total of 427 years of imprisonment. In Apsa de Mijloc, the locals killed four Soviet officials and were deported to Siberia. Eventually two kolkhoz were created in Apsa de Jos in 1949 and united three years later. In 1959, the kolkhoz of the village of Stramtura was united with the former, which was named \\"friendship of peoples.\\" Although the Soviets opened the first university in Uzhhorod, built the first hydro-electric plant (on the Tereblea and Rica rivers), partially electrified the railroad and even held the World Children Olympic Games in Uzhhorod in 1990, severe damage was produced during this period to the cultural and ecological heritage of the whole region of Trans-Carpathia, including Northern Maramure»ô. 1991‚Äìpresent At the fall of the USSR in 1991, Ukraine became independent. Trans-Carpathia has since then been an administrative region (oblast).

M., Giuliano, T., & Hertel, P. (1985). Cognitive interdependence in close relationships. In W. J. Ickes (Ed.), Compatible and incompatible relationships (pp. 253-276). New York: Springer-Verlag. A transactive memory system is a mechanism through which groups collectively encode, store, and retrieve knowledge. Transactive memory was initially studied in couples and families where individuals had close relationships but was later extended to teams, larger groups, and organizations to explain how they develop a \\"group mind\\", a memory system that is more complex and potentially more effective than that of any of its individual constituents. A transactive memory system includes memory stored in each individual, the interactions between memory within the individuals, as well as the processes that update this memory. Transactive memory, then, is the shared store of knowledge. According to Wegner, a transactive memory system consists of the knowledge stored in each individual's memory combined with metamemory containing information regarding the different teammate's domains of expertise. The transactive memory system works similarly to external memory, where other members of the group are the external memory aid. Just as an individual's metamemory allows them to be aware of what information is available for retrieval, so does the transactive memory system provide teammates with information regarding the knowledge they have access to within the group.Wegner, D. M. (1986). Transactive memory: A contemporary analysis of the group mind. In B.Mullen & G. R. Goethals (Eds.), Theories of group behavior (pp. 185‚Äì205). New York: Springer-Verlag Group members learn who knowledge experts are and how to access expertise through communicative processes. In this way, a transactive memory system can provide the group members with more and better knowledge than any individual could access on their own. History Transactive memory was first envisioned by Daniel Wegner in 1985. This concept proposed that when two individuals spend a lot of time around each other and work together, they create a shared store of knowledge between the members. In essence, one member of the couple could store information within their partner and then recall that information by asking their partner about it. This concept was different and unique from other descriptions of socially distributed cognition in that it describes a situation where individuals hold different knowledge compared to shared information, and members of the group engage in transactions to assist in recall of the stored information. In a recent review, Ren and Argote described transactive memory as existing of both a structural component (the linkages of individual memory to the collective) and transactive processes that make the transactive memory dynamic. Wegner first proposed these three processes which occur in groups that lead to the formation and reification of transactive memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval described more below. In a series of experiments, Hollingshead found that romantic partners (who are assumed to have transactive memory) performed better on knowledge recall than dyads and that couples will memorize more words in a list than two strangers when they are rewarded on number of unique words you recall. The explanation for these findings are that couples know how best to remind each other of the knowledge they have, and that couples have a good conception of the other's knowledge and will therefore avoid memorizing words within their partner's domain. Strangers don't have access to this same shared information which leads to poorer performance in these kinds of tasks. Transactive memory was further extended by Diane Liang and colleagues into the realm of work groups. In this work, the development of transactive memory was conceived of as a way to improve group's performance when engaging in interdependent tasks. After this extension, transactive memory became more prolific in organizational behavior among other disciplines. Transactive processes Just like human memory, the development of a transactive memory system involves three stages: encoding, storage and retrieval. These processes are transactive, meaning that they are updated as members exchange information with one another. =Encoding= In the encoding stage, the teammates gain information on the other team members domains of knowledge and categorize it by ascribing each knowledge domain to the corresponding team member. Sometimes, this acquaintance can emerge through \\"who did what\\" or \\"who knows what\\" conversation, or even through direct instruction such as by telling a teammate to remember certain information. There may also be discussion and negotiation of where and in what form to store information in the group. The encoding process is very important in the development of transactive memory. Encoding occurs through interaction between teammates: through sharing knowledge and seeking information from other team members, teammates learn the expertise of each team member as a first essential step towards specialization. These experts then are responsible for continuing to encode new and relevant information in their domains of knowledge. =Storage= In the storage stage, the relevant information is stored in the possession of the team member, or members, with the corresponding expertise; once the experts have been identified, new information is transmitted directly to the those team members. This improves the learning process and reduces the load on the memory of individual teammates. With transactive memory storage, a team member only has to remember the information in their domain of expertise, while they only have to remember the what the other members' domains of expertise are rather than storing all the information in the transactive memory. Information may be also lost or modified during storage for transitive memory, as is in the case of individual memory. These modifications, however, may be even more rapid and impactful than in individual memory because the information is scattered and stored with multiple members in the group, making the information more readily replaced with misinformation. =Retrieval= During the retrieval stage, a group member uses the developed transactive memory to identify a group member that specializes in the required knowledge area and then turns to that member to attain the knowledge. If the inquiring member has not encoded in their individual metamemory who specializes in the knowledge, retrieval can be initiated by asking other members in the storage system for who the expert who specializes in the information they want to retrieve is, then connecting with that expert after a series of consultations. If this information is accurate and useful, the linkage to the member with specialized knowledge is strengthened. If the information is not accurate, then the encoding stage is entered into again such that information about the inaccuracy of the knowledge the specialized member provided is re-encoded and stored in the transactive memory system. Development Much research has shown that a transactive memory system is primarily developed through interactions between team members. Training on the task that a group is expected to do together has been shown to assist in the development of a transactive memory system. In this study, when the group members were trained together, the team developed a stronger transactive memory system, recalled more information about the process, and made fewer errors compared to teams where individuals had gone through the same training but separately. The researchers concluded that the interactions that took place during the joint training allowed the team members to develop an understanding of their teammates' skills, assisted their search for relevant information about the task from their teammates, and assess the accuracy and reliability of this information. As a result, groups that trained together performed better in the task. In a later study, these same researchers also determined that familiarity with their teammates or liking didn't explain the differences between groups that were trained together and those that were not. In this study, the researchers gave the groups that didn't train together a team building exercise but they still did not do as well as the trained together group. Furthermore, research has shown that the knowledge about who knows what can be available before the team processes. At the first stage in a group's life cycle, knowing each of the team members' expertise allows the group to distribute work in a more efficient way and allocate different assignments to team members that are the most qualified for these assignments. The existence of many interactions in the early stages of group formation provides each of the teammates the opportunity to get to know other team members' training, level of expertise or the lack of knowledge in certain areas, and develop a shared understanding of the task's requirements and the way that the total of the teammates knowledge combines together. Hence, it seems that communication serves as a crucial component in the development of transactive memory. Yet, it seems that not any kind of communication and interaction between team members will bring to the construction of transactive memory. Communication, in general serves as a way of transferring information from one person to another, but for the purpose of transactive memory construction this communication must deal with information regarding the knowledge, expertise and relevant experience of other individuals in the system. If the team members communicate more face to face while planning a project the TMS will emerge faster and will be stronger. The level of face to face communication while the team is planning could predict implementation-phase TMS. Moreland & Myaskovsky (2000) showed that transactive memory can be developed without any interaction between teammates. As a substitute to teammates' communication they provided group members feedback ranking team members' skills in the relevant task domains before they started performing the task. Although the feedback and the information regarding teammates knowledge was provided by the researchers and teammates did not communicate with each other beforehand, this information positively affected the team's transactive memory score and performance.Moreland R.L and Myaskovsky L. (2000). Exploring the Performance Benefits of Group Training: Transactive Memory or Improved Communication? Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes Vol. 82, No. 1, 117‚Äì133. This experiment demonstrated that the sharing specific information regarding team members' knowledge and domains of expertise formation is necessary for transactive memory development, either through direct interaction or by another means of information transformation. Indicators Many researchers consider the basic components of transactive memory system to be specialization, coordination and credibility. This is a common misconception of how transactive memory systems operate within groups. These indicators of TMS occur after a group has established a transactive memory system and are due to the existence of transactive memory within the group. Because these three factors occur more prevalently in groups that have developed a TMS, they are often measured as a proxy for measuring the exact transactive memory system. The most prevalent measure of transactive memory as developed by Kyle Lewis measures these three components as indicators that a group has developed a transactive memory. Other measures, namely Austin's attempts to measure the perceptions of expertise within the group as a more direct measure of transactive memory. =Specialization= A strong transactive memory system is achieved when the group gains information about the knowledge repertoire that all other teammates hold and use this information in order to acquire different complementary knowledge. Once members within the group have a good understanding of who knows what within the group, they can begin to differentiate in their knowledge. This differentiation of knowledge is where the real benefit of a transactive memory system is enacted because, with less overlap in member's areas of expertise, distribution of labor becomes easier and the group can become more efficient (Wegner 1987). When each team member can deepen his knowledge in any areas that are lacking (as opposed to acquiring congruent knowledge) they will enlarge the teams' total collective knowledge. Hollingshead (1998a) demonstrated that specialization lead to a more efficient and organized effort investment in information retrieval, prevention of information redundancy and supplied accessibility to larger range of expertise.Hollingshead, A. B. (1998a). Distributed knowledge and Transactive processes in groups. In M. A.Neale, E.A.Mannix, and D.H.Gruenfeld (Eds.), Research on managing groups and teams (Vol.1). Greenwich, CT: JAI Press =Coordination= Coordination refers to the extent of necessity in explicit revealed planning and coordinating efforts during teamwork. When a group possesses a strong transactive memory system, the need for explicit coordination efforts reduces since teammates are aware of other teammates strengths and weaknesses, can anticipate their behavior and responds, and make quick adjustments of their own behavior in return. In groups that have developed a transactive memory, members are able to easily coordinate with one another and can go directly to those with expertise if they need their information. =Credibility= 'Credibility' reflects the extent to which the team members believe that the relevant task knowledge possessed by any of the other team members is correct and accurate. When groups that developed a transactive memory system, they will have gone through the encoding, storing, retrieval process several times for information. As new information is brought to the group's attention it can be evaluated and then reencoded into the transactive memory system. If a member's area of expertise has been used several times without issue, then other group members will begin to see the group member's knowledge as more credible (Wegner 1987). If a group has a well-developed transactive memory system, all members within the group would be seen as credible. Team performance The existence of a transactive memory system within a group allows for quick access to a large amount of knowledge, improving information integration processes, improving decision making processes, influencing the perception of efficiency of other teammates, and increasing their satisfaction and sense of identification with the team and the organization. Transactive memory is composed of specialized knowledge and understanding of who has that knowledge, but benefits are not limited to just groups that engage in a lot of knowledge work. Transactive memory may enhance performance through three major mechanisms:Moreland, R. L. (1999). Transactive memory: Learning who knows what in work groups and organizations. In L. Thompson, D. Messick, &J.; Levine (Eds.), Shared cognition in organizations: The management of knowledge (pp. 3‚Äì31). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum * Division of the responsibility on different kinds of knowledge across the teammates allows each one of them to broaden his own knowledge in a specific area while maintaining access to relevant required task knowledge possessed by others. *Developing transactive memory system will shorten the time needed for seeking the appropriate knowledge: when each team member knows whom to turn to for the required information, less time is wasted in search for relevant task knowledge. *The shared understanding of the teammates regarding the interpersonal relations in the team and the different expertise domains, enables them to better predict and anticipate how their team colleagues would behave, leading to well coordinated and efficient interactions.Cannon-Bowers, J. A., Salas, E., & Converse, S. A. (1993). Shared mental models in expert team decision making. In N. J. Castellan, Jr. (Ed.), Current issues in individual and group decision making (pp.221‚Äì246).Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Transactive memory may not be helpful for all kinds of groups or all kinds of work. Lewis and Herndon (2011) suggested criteria for kinds of tasks that a developed transactive memory system will be the most helpful in improving the performance of. * Tasks that require diverse knowledge. * Tasks that require a deep understanding of specialized knowledge. * Tasks where the credibility and accuracy of information is important. * Tasks where it is possible to know which members possess expertise. * Tasks that require a complete application of knowledge to the task. * Tasks where efficient coordination between members is important. For these reasons, groups performing tasks that can't be broken apart or require little specialization may not get much benefit out of the development of a transactive memory system. The authors suggest that tasks where ideas have to be executed and all members have the same goal will benefit the most from a transactive memory system. Conversely the authors suggest that groups that engage in brainstorming or decision tasks may develop transactive memory systems faster than those merely executing ideas because there is more knowledge sharing and interaction between members. Extensions to other domains When transactive memory was first envisioned, the authors were describing an external memory store within other people. They did acknowledge that we often store information within objects such as notebooks, books, or other recordings. These objects are static and transactive processes cannot occur. These objects, therefore, cannot cue memories within individuals in the same way another person could. The Internet, however, is much more dynamic than a book and individuals can engage in similar transactive processes as they would with other individuals. Research published in the journal Science on 14 July 2011 suggests that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information, but higher rates of recall of the sources of the information. The authors suggest that this research demonstrates that individuals are developing a transactive memory system with the Internet, relying on it for information instead of internalizing it within their own memories. To explain how external memory stores are related to transactive memory systems, Schakel (2013) described them as external artifacts which may either (be used to) influence or represent the ostensive or performative aspects of transactive memory systems.

He played much of his football beside Jack Dyer as a knock ruckman. Career Morris started his career with the Melbourne reserve team but before he could make an impression he decided to join the army. He returned to football in 1942 and was traded to Richmond and made his senior debut that year. In 1945 he won the first of his three Best and Fairest awards, the others coming in 1948 and 1950. Morris won the Brownlow Medal for the best player in the VFL in 1948, joining Stan Judkins as the only Richmond players to win the Medal to that time. He polled well in other Brownlow Medal nights, finishing equal second in 1946 and equal third in 1950. He was a regular Victorian interstate representative, playing a total of 15 games and captaining the state in 1950. He was also captain of Richmond, leading the club in 1950 and 1951. On 3 April 1950 Morris married Jill Tolley, of Adelaide's wealthy Tolley family. At the end of the 1951 season Morris left Richmond and joined VFA Club Box Hill as captain-coach. He captain-coached Box Hill from 1952 to 1954, winning the Club's Best and Fairest each season. He played 58 games for Box Hill and scored 101 goals. Recognition In 2002 Morris was inducted into the Richmond Hall of Fame and he is also a member of their official 'Team of the Century', being named in the forward pocket. He is also a member of Box Hill's official 'Greatest Ever Team' as announced in 2000, selected as first ruck. On 1 June 2009, Morris was inducted to the AFL Hall of Fame. Death Morris's story is perhaps the most tragic of all Brownlow Medallists; in 1960 he committed suicide at the age of 39. Morris, who was recently separated from his wife, had threatened to do himself harm days before he died. His body was discovered by his wife in the living room dressed in night attire. There was gas leaking out of the oven and the heater.

Background In 1981 the New South Wales Government passed legislation which vested all unmined coal to the crown. The effect of the Coal Acquisition Act 1981 (NSW) was that the government became the owner of all unmined coal in the state. This enabled the government to tax the mining of coal, a situation it was not allowed to do when coal was privately owned. According to the board‚Äôs annual report, the net benefit to the State from the acquisition of private coal is estimated at $10 billion after taking into account compensation payments totalling $682 million. The board and the New South Wales Coal Compensation Review Tribunal were established in 1985 to address concerns by former coal owners through the introduction of the act. Both bodies are the result of recommendations of the Coal Compensation Taskforce Report. Constitution The board was established under the Coal Acquisition (Compensation) Arrangements 1985 (NSW). Those arrangements are made by the Governor of New South Wales under the Coal Acquisition Act 1981 (NSW), a law which entitles the governor to determine what compensation should be payable for the acquisition of coal in 1981. The governor may appoint five part-time members to the board. This is on the recommendation of the minister responsible for mineral resources. One member has to be an employee of the Department of Mines. The governor may appoint one of the members to be the chairperson of the board. Jurisdiction The board has jurisdiction to determine whether compensation is payable as a result of the compulsory acquisition of coal. It may also determine the amount of compensation payable as a result of that acquisition. The board also has jurisdiction to determine whether there should be restitution of coal owner to a private owner, and it may also deal with the voluntary acquisi5ion of coal titles. According to the board‚Äôs Annual Report, it received compensation claims between July 1985 and March 1986, and between December 1993 and July 1994 totaling some 28,261 claims. The New South Wales government flagged that it wished for all compensation claims to be determined by March 2007. Appeals A person unhappy with the decision of the board may appeal to the New South Wales Coal Compensation Tribunal. In certain cases, prerogative relief may be available from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. See for example NSW Coal Compensation Board v Nardell Colliery Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 35. Chairperson The final chairperson was Mr Alastair Fotheringham, who was appointed on 1 November 1999 and reappointed on 29 October 2003.

Vegas Vic sign by YESCO. Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign owned by YESCO. YESCO is a privately owned manufacturer of electric signs based in Salt Lake City, founded by Thomas Young in 1920. The company provides design, fabrication, installation and maintenance of signs. Many notable sign projects have been produced by YESCO, including the NBC Experience globe in New York City, the historic El Capitan Theatre and Wax Museum marquees in Hollywood, the Reno Arch, and in Las Vegas, Vegas Vic, the Fremont Street Experience, the Astrolabe in The Venetian, the Wynn Las Vegas resort sign, and the Aria Resort & Casino.  History  The company was created by Thomas Young on March 20, 1920.Nevada Contractors' Billboard 2003 The young sign painter had left the United Kingdom just a decade earlier to immigrate with his family to Ogden, Utah. In the beginning, his shop specialized in coffin plates, gold leaf window lettering, lighted signs and painted advertisements. As the science of lighting and sign-making advanced, so did Tom Young‚Äôs signs. In 1933, YESCO opened a branch office in the Apache Hotel in Las Vegas. The company erected their first neon sign in Las Vegas for the Boulder Club.Nevada Department of Cultural Affairs YESCO ‚Äì soon became recognized as a leader in the sign industry, tackling large and complex sign projects. For example, it erected the first neon spectacular sign in Las Vegas for the Boulder Club in the late ‚Äô30s, and in 1995 it completed the four-block-long Fremont Street Experience canopy in Las Vegas. YESCO continues to design, build, install and maintain signs and interior displays in areas. In recent years, YESCO has built a substantial outdoor digital media (billboard) division of its business. YESCO has approximately 1,000 employees, more than 40 offices, and operates three manufacturing plants featuring automated and custom equipment. Additional smaller manufacturing and service facilities are located through the United States and Canada. YESCO offers sign and lighting service franchises in states east of Colorado and throughout Canada. In 2015 Young Electric Sign Company sold YESCO Electronics, a subsidiary company, to Samsung Electronics of America, Inc.. Samsung rebranded the division as Prismview.  Landmark Signs  =The NBC Experience Store Globe= NBC ushered in the millennium with a new YESCO ‚Äúmessage globe‚Äù in its NBC Experience store, located at Rockefeller Center in New York City. The electronic sign quickly became recognized as one of the most distinctive electronic displays in the world. From the outside of the building, it looks like a brilliant illuminated globe. The 35‚Äô-diameter hemisphere is covered with thousands of full-color LEDs. Colorful video and special effects, along with animations provided by YESCO‚Äôs media services group, are displayed on the globe‚Äôs surface, telling the NBC story. When it was first turned on, it literally stopped traffic on West 49th Street. =Vegas Vic= Perhaps the world‚Äôs most recognized electronic sign, Vegas Vic was designed by and built by YESCO. Upon its installation in 1951 over the Pioneer Club on historical Fremont Street, the 40'-tall electronic cowboy immediately became Las Vegas‚Äôs unofficial greeter. =Wynn Las Vegas= The tall marquee features a high, wide, concave, double-faced LED message center with a first-of-its-kind ‚Äúmoving eraser.‚Äù Conceived by Steve Wynn, the massive eraser glides silently and smoothly up and down over the LED message center, appearing to change the graphics as it goes. The eraser weighs 62,000 pounds, and is counterbalanced by a 62,000-pound weight inside the sign.http://www.fishertechnical.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=69:the- wynn-hotel-sign&catid;=23:theme-parks&Itemid;=37 The sign uses 4,377,600 LEDs and the eraser is powered by a motor at its base that runs a gear and cable system.

Other projects YESCO designed and installed the signs and light up strips at Allegiant Stadium, the home of the Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV Rebels Football. The company also designed and installed the signage at the Raiders headquarters and practice facility in Henderson, Nevada. The company has been instrumental in supporting the Neon Museum, which is dedicated to preserving the neon signs and associated artifacts of Las Vegas.a2zlasvegas Some of the retired signs include the sign for the Silver Slipper casino and Aladdin's lamp from the first version of Aladdin Casino. In 2004 the Binions Horseshoe sign Harrah's.  Key Individuals  =Founder= Born in Sunderland, United Kingdom in 1895, Thomas Young was 15 years old when his family emigrated to Ogden, Utah. Hard-working and talented, the boy applied his passion to making signs, becoming a Master Sign Writer. He began by creating wall-lettering and gold-leaf window signs, working for the Electric Service Company and the Redfield-King Sign Company in Ogden. Young married Elmina Carlisle in 1916. Four years later, in 1920, he founded his own sign company: Thomas Young Sign Company, which specialized in coffin plates, gold window lettering, lighted signs and painted advertisements. In 1932 Young expanded his business to Las Vegas, and within two years purchased the Ogden Armory for $12,000 to expand production capacity. He also started a branch in Salt Lake City in that year. Young was elected president of the National Sign Association in 1936, serving for two terms. A year later, in 1937, he moved his family and YESCO headquarters to Salt Lake City, Utah, and continued expanding the business. In 1969 Young turned over the reins of company leadership to his son who currently serves as the Chairman of the Board. The company is now managed by third and fourth generations of the Young family. = Designers = Some of YESCO's most prominent signage designers have included: * Charles Barnard - designer of Vegas Vickie * Rudy Crisostomo - designer of the Rio's column * Dan Edwards - designer of Lucky the Clown of Circus Circus * Jack Larsen Sr - designer of the Silver Slipper * Kermit Wayne - designer of the Stardust * Pat Denner - designer of the Vegas Vic and Wendover Will * Jim Geitzen - designer of the Aria_Resort_and_Casino and The Linq  References   External links  * The Neon Museum website Category:Signage companies Category:Neon lighting Category:History of Las Vegas Category:Manufacturing companies based in Salt Lake City Category:American companies established in 1920 Category:Design companies established in 1920 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1920 ","title":"YESCO"},{"id":"9886567","text":"The Swift Current Rampage are a Junior box lacrosse team based out of Swift Current, Saskatchewan, playing in the top league in Saskatchewan, the Prairie Gold Lacrosse League.

David \\"Zeb\\" Cook is an American game designer, best known for his work at TSR, Inc., where he was employed for over fifteen years. Cook designed several games, wrote the Expert Set for Dungeons & Dragons, worked as lead designer of the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and invented the Planescape setting for AD&D.; He is a member of the Origins Hall of Fame. Early life Cook was born in East Lansing, Michigan, and grew up on a farm in Iowa. His father was a farmer and college professor. In junior high school, Cook played wargames such as Avalon Hill's Blitzkrieg and Afrika Korps: \\"I was primarily a wargamer, but there wasn't any role-playing available then\\". In college, he was introduced to the Dungeons & Dragons role- playing game through the University of Iowa gaming club. Cook earned his B.A. in English (with a Theater minor) in 1977. He married his high school sweetheart, Helen, with whom he had one son, Ian. Cook became a high school teacher in Milligan, Nebraska, where his students gave him his nickname of \\"Zeb.\\" The name derives from his signature, which is dominated by a stroke resembling a 'Z,' as well as from his resemblance to the James Arness character Zeb Macahan in the TV series How the West Was Won. Career Cook responded to an ad in Dragon magazine for a game designer position at TSR. After writing a sample module section and completing the designer test that the company then used, Cook became the third full-time game designer hired by TSR. Lawrence Schick was head of design and development at the time and brought Cook on board during a time of substantial growth at TSR. Cook later became Senior Designer. \\"Game designing is hard work [...] but everything worth doing is hard work. The important thing is to do it well, and to have fun while you're doing it.\\" Cook created role-playing games, modules, family board games, card games, rulebooks, and party mystery games. He created the Partyzone mystery game line and The Spy Ring scenario. The first Partyzone game was named one of the Top 100 Games of 1985 by Games Magazine. Other notable works for TSR include the role-playing games Conan the Barbarian, Crimefighters, The Adventures of Indiana Jones, Star Frontiers, Sirocco, and Escape from New York. Cook also wrote several influential early adventure modules for D&D; and AD&D;, such as A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity, I1: Dwellers of the Forbidden City, X1: The Isle of Dread, X4: Master of the Desert Nomads, and X5: Temple of Death (the 'Desert Nomads' series). Other module work included CM4: Earthshaker!, AC5: Dragon Tiles II, AC2: D&D; Game Combat Shield, B6: The Veiled Society, CB1: Conan Unchained!, and M1: Blizzard Pass for D&D; and AD&D;, and Top Secret module TS005: Orient Express and Boot Hill module BH2: Lost Conquistador Mine. After Tom Moldvay wrote the second edition of the D&D; Basic Set, published in 1980, Cook developed the Expert Set to take characters beyond third level. Cook was the primary author of the original Oriental Adventures, ostensibly under the guidance and direction of Gary Gygax, which among other things introduced the concept of non-weapon proficiencies into AD&D;,* David Cook, \\"Oriental opens new vistas\\", Dragon 104:20-21, Dec 1985. and he designed the far eastern setting, Kara-Tur. Cook, with Jim Ward, Steve Winter, and Mike Breault, co-wrote the adventure scenario that was adapted into the game Pool of Radiance. Cook was the lead designer on the 2nd edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. In Dragon #118 (February 1987), Cook wrote a column titled \\"Who Dies?\\" in which he discussed which character classes may be thrown out in the revision, with the intention of provoking a response from readers. Cook was also the lead designer on the Planescape campaign setting. When TSR was looking to replace Spelljammer after the setting ended, Slade Henson suggested a new campaign setting could be built on the first-edition Manual of the Planes; after the idea sat dormant for a year, Cook picked it up and invented Planescape as a result. One reviewer described Planescape as \\"the finest game world ever produced for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\\". Cook left TSR in 1994 to work in the field of electronic media. He worked on the game Fallout 2. He was the lead designer on the 2005 City of Villains computer game for Cryptic Studios. After he left Cryptic, he joined Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment as the lead systems designer for the video game Stargate Worlds. In 2001 he was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame. As of 2013, Cook works as Content Designer at ZeniMax Online Studios on The Elder Scrolls Online.

Koh Tonsay is located just south of Kep town, has an area of around and can be reached by ferry boat from the local port. The island is open for visitors and tourists, who value white sand beaches and the marine scenery. The surrounding sea is shallow, the sea bed gradually sloping, excellent for recreational activities. A number of coral reefs and a variety of habitats for animals and plants attract researchers and ecologists. During Norodom Sihanouk‚Äôs Sangkum Reastr Niyum regime (1953 to 1970), the island was a rehabilitation center for convicted criminals, who were in turn used to defend the island. Horse cart paths and wooden, thatched roof hotels were also constructed during this time. Most of this infrastructure has been destroyed by weather and decades of war. Currently there are individually built and run guest houses on the main beach, attracting Cambodian and foreign tourists. Local settlers - fishermen and their families also live on the island, occupying other beaches around the shoreline. Etymology Tonsay () is derived from the word \\"rumsay\\" (, \\"discharge\\"). While trying to avoid the commander‚Äôs troops, Khmer prince Sakor Reach grew hopeless because his troops were exhausted. He led his remaining troops across the sea to an island in front of Kep city, where the troops spread out. Accordingly, the island was called Koh Rumsay (), the name underwent a transformation towards Koh Tonsay (·ûÄ·üÑ·üá·ûë·ûì·üí·ûü·û∂·ûô), as it is known today.

Fictional background story The Draco tavern is located in Siberia, near the Mount Forel spaceport. The tavern was created after a race of sentient aliens called Chirpsithra landed on Earth. The Chirpsithra stand 11 feet tall with salmon pink exoskeletons. All of them appear to be female. They enjoy mild electric currents, whose effect on them is similar to that of alcohol on humans. They originated on tidally locked planets around red dwarf suns. Eventually, they had control over every single red dwarf sun in the galaxy, or so they claim. They enjoy the company of other sentient beings, and are extremely intelligent. Units of currency used for Chirp-Human commerce are the \\"svith\\" and trade markers, mentioned in the story \\"Cruel and Unusual\\". When they first put their mile-wide bubbleships into orbit around the Moon and landed in Siberia, they brought a host of aliens with a desire to eat, drink and socialize, thus the Draco Tavern was designed to cater to their individual, very diverse, and often conflicting interests. Notable stories include \\"Limits\\", in which Schumann overhears some traders talking about humans' limited lifespan giving them a unique approach to mathematics, thus justifying withholding the secret of immortality, and \\"The Green Marauder\\", in which a new \\"alien\\" species turns out to be from the early development of Earth's ecosystem before photosynthesis poisoned the atmosphere with oxygen. Publication information Several of the Rick Schumann/Draco Tavern short stories which have appeared in other short story collections by Larry Niven were not reprinted in this book, thus it is not a Draco Tavern omnibus; there have also been further stories in the series since the publication of the book.

Bryant (August 3, 1806 ‚Äì October 10, 1860) was an American jurist from Kentucky. He served as the first Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court in the Oregon Territory. United States President James K. Polk appointed Bryant, of Indiana, to the court once the Oregon Territory was established in 1848. In Indiana he served in both houses of the Indiana General Assembly and was a county judge. Bryant also fought in the Black Hawk War against Native Americans. Early life Bryant was born on August 3, 1806, in Mercer County, Kentucky.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. He grew up there and left home at age 18 after his mother had died when he was young and could no longer tolerate his father's religious upbringing. In 1825, Bryant moved to Rockville, Indiana, where he would fight in the Black Hawk War and begin practicing law. After the war he served in the Indiana House of Representatives from 1831 to 1836, followed by serving in the Indiana State Senate from 1836 until 1839. Bryant started a law practice in 1840 with General T. A. Howard, and later served as a circuit court judge for Rockville. After changing political party affiliations from Whig to Democrat, he was appointed by United States President James K. Polk to serve as chief justice of the three member Oregon Supreme Court. Bryant was appointed on August 14, 1848, the same day the new Oregon Territory was created. He migrated to the territory in 1849, arriving April 9. Oregon While in Oregon, Bryant purchased an island and milling operation from George Abernethy in the Willamette River called Abernethy's Island. However, the island near Oregon City was previously claimed by Doctor John McLoughlin. Later this became an issue between McLoughlin and Samuel R. Thurston. Thurston had worked the Donation Land Claim Act in Congress to exclude McLoughlin's claim to Oregon City and the island. =Oregon Supreme Court= On August 14, 1848, Bryant was nominated by President Polk to be \\"chief justice of the supreme court of the United States for the Territory of Oregon\\" and was subsequently unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate. He held his first session of court on August 20, 1849 in Oregon City. As the only federal judge in the territory, Bryant presided over the first criminal trial in what is now the state of Washington in 1849. At that time the Oregon Territory encompassed all of present states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. On May 1, 1849, a group of roughly 100 Snoqualmie and Skewahamish tribesmen showed up at Fort Nisqually. Fort Nisqually at this time was a fur trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company. The Native Americans were not there to attack, but eventually an American named Leander Wallace was killed by the natives. Following the murder, U.S. troops were deployed and demanded the tribes turn over the killers. Only after giving the tribe's chief 80 blankets did they turn over anyone. These six Snoqualmies were charged with murder and Justice Bryant began the trial on October 1, 1849, at Fort Steilacoom after a grand jury returned indictments for all six. The outcome was that two, Kussus and Quallalwowt, were convicted of the murder and sentenced to hanging on October 2. On October 3, the two were hanged by U.S. Marshal Joseph L. Meek. The total cost of the trial was $2,379.54, which included the cost of the 80 blankets. Former judge of the Provisional Government of Oregon and later justice on the Oregon Supreme Court, Alonzo A. Skinner was brought with Bryant to serve as the prosecutor.Judicial History. Yamhill County Circuit Court. Retrieved January 10, 2008. The next year Chief Justice Bryant resigned from the court. His resignation was effective January 1, 1851. Later years After leaving the court, Bryant returned east. He first moved to the nation's capital in Washington, DC, before returning to Indiana and his hometown of Rockville. William Bryant died there on October 10, 1860.

Legend  Adams, for whom the legend became known and whose first name forever has been lost to history, was born in Rochester, NY July 10, 1829.Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver, Dobie, J. Frank, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1939, page 5 In August 1864 he was journeying in his wagon from Los Angeles to Tucson.Dobie, page 5 After Apaches set his wagon on fire, Adams drove a dozen saved horses towards Sacaton, Arizona, with the hope to sell them. In Sacaton, Adams met a group of twenty one miners led by John Brewer traveling together in search of the gold fields. The party also accounted the Pima-Mexican guide who promised the prospectors to lead them to the valley of gold :‚ÄúI know a place where canyon walls cry tears of [gold] every day! And those tears are larger than your coins!‚Äù Supposedly, In 1862, the young Pima-Mexican had gone on an expedition with the Apaches when those attacked Pueblo Indians in western New Mexico. While on the expedition he had seen gold nuggets that were larger than oak nuts. The young man had appreciation for works made out of silver and turquoise but had no knowledge of gold value. The miners made a bargain with the guide who only asked for a horse, a saddle, a weapon and some of the gold in exchange. The group was badly in need of horses, and when by fate Adams appeared in Sacaton with his twelve head, Brewer struck a deal with Adams on the terms that Adams would share leadership with him in exchange for donating his horses. Twenty-two men set out on August 20.Dobie, pg 11 Along with their guide the group followed White River and its east fork into the White Mountains and entered western New Mexico. The guide paused and pointed to two mountains that were shaped like sugar loaves. ‚ÄúThe gold canyon lies at the foot of those peaks,‚Äù the guide said. According to Adams, from that mountain lookout the miners were able to observe San Francisco Mountains. Adams thought that this mountain range was located on Mt. Ord, or on one of the mountaintops nearby. The miners entered a canyon with a fantastic gold deposit through 'the Little Door', as Adams referred to it. He said that the passageway was so narrow that the riders had to enter it one by one. They descended a canyon via a Z-shaped trail. At the bottom of the canyon was a spring with a low falls above it.Dobie, pg 15 Within a few days the group collected a fortune of gold nuggets that they hid in a corn-grinding basin left by ancient Indians. The young guide left the miners on the first night after the discovery and after being paid. Before leaving the guide issued a warning. He told the group not to stay long in the canyon that was a campsite for Apaches. Apache Chief Nana and 30 warriors appeared the second day. The chief told them not to go above the falls. Some of the men started construction of a cabin. A cache of the gold was hidden under the cabin's hearth stone.Dobie, pgs 17-18 The miners continued to mine the gold until they ran out of supplies. The party decided to send Brewer and five others to buy more supplies at Old Fort Wingate, west of modern Grants. After Brewer's party left, some of the men began secretly searching above the falls. They returned to camp with large nuggets. Adams warned them against it but the nuggets were kept.Dobie, pg 20 Nine days after the provisions party did not return, Adams became concerned about their safety. Along with another miner named Davidson, Adams climbed out of the canyon to discover five bodies on the trail, Brewer was not among them. They raced back towards camp, but it was too late. A large party of Indians had reached the camp and killed the remaining miners. The cabin had been set on fire, making the hearth stone too hot to move.Dobie, pg 24 Thirteen days later, Adams and Davidson were found by a military patrol out of Fort Apache, AZ.Dobie, pg 27 Upon recovery Adams settled in California and when the Apache Wars ended, he led several expeditions to find the canyon and the basin filled with gold. Adams must have had a terrible sense of direction, after so many years of searching his quest proved hopeless. But in his search he inspired others to joint the hunt. In July 1949, 83-year-old Robert W. \\"Bob\\" Lewis, who said he had known Adams when he had been a cowpuncher and law officer in Socorro County, New Mexico, stated that he and Adams searched for the gold together in 1889 twenty five years after the massacre in 1864. But it was not until 1918, that he claimed to have single-handedly found the skeletons and Adam's cabin at the mouth of a canyon 35 miles northwest of Magdalena, New Mexico. Lewis said that everything was there just as Adams had described except for the gold. He said he later found out the missing gold had been found by a Magdelena Sheepherder who received $20,000 for it with which he bought a ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Possible locations  For decades the Zuni Mountains were considered the most plausible location of the diggings. Thousands of prospectors, ranch-hands, and men-of-fortune searched this area and the rest of southwestern New Mexico prior to World War II, as the Adams diggings became the most sought-for gold in the country. The combination of the depression and the deregulation of the gold market prompted the most unlikely people to search for the diggings. Between 1895 and 1930 several large logging communities flourished in the Zuni Mountains, several with schools and post offices; wide-gauge railroads crisscrossed the mountains. The loggers were well aware of the Adams legend, as it had become a nationally known story. Between running logs nothing was more common than prospecting except for drinking. Rumors of gold in the Zunis had become so common that the U.S. government ordered several geological expeditions in the years between World War I and World War II to verify whether this claim could be supported. The geologists found nothing. In the 1950s the area was thoroughly re-explored for uranium during the uranium boom around Grants, New Mexico. Eventually the obsession with the Zuni Mountains as a host for the Adams diggings faded. It was also around the mid-century that the popularity of the Adams legend began to diminish and the Lost Dutchman Mine became America's most sought-for lost gold mine. The Adams diggings were beginning to seem a hoax or a mine unlikely to ever be found. Geologically, the Adams diggings could only be in the southwestern quadrant of the state. Adams himself spent most of the remainder of his life searching the areas in and around Reserve, New Mexico. This area was the largest gold producing area in the state, and hosted several small mining booms, including the rich strikes at Silver City and Pinos Altos. The areas that could conceivably host the diggings in this region (containing several large mountain ranges that remain sparsely inhabited) are numerous, as minerals and evidence of previous mining can be found throughout the area. Local folklore will tell you that the gold is at the headwaters of either the Black River, the Gila River, or the Prieto River. Spanish Lore will tell you to look to the Blue Mountains. Dozens of mining camps in this region of New Mexico were thought to be the Adams diggings for brief periods, until each proved itself to be less rich than at first indicated: egregious hopes followed by rapid disappointment. That seems to be the story of gold in the desert southwest. The Datils and Gallinas Mountains and the basins to the north of these mountains were considered possible locations for the diggings that increased in popularity as the other locations lost appeal. Dick French, in his book Four Days from Fort Wingate,French, Richard, \\"Four Days From Fort Wingate\\", Caxon Press, Caldwell, ID, 1994 places the diggings in this area. It has become known as \\"Dick French‚Äôs area,\\" although his location was known to have been found by others in the 1950s, if not earlier. A follow-on work by Dick French, Return to the Lost Adams Diggings: The Paul A. Hale StoryFrench, Richard U., \\"Return to the Lost Adams Diggings: The Paul A. Hale Story\\", 2014 published in 2014 uses historical, artifactual, geographical, and geological data to demonstrate the viability of the location in the new book as the locality of the Lost Adams Diggings. The new book demonstrates the presence of significant gold mineralization, adds a wrinkle to the story by presenting evidence of colonial Spanish activity in the area dated to the 1600s, and identifies and locates every critical landmark. The new book contains maps, pictures of artifacts, assay reports, and is written in a conversational format with Dick interviewing the re-discoverers Paul Hale and Ronald Schade. A similar but geographically less plausible location was found in eastern Arizona by Don Fingado near Clifton. The site contains features described by Adams much like the area favored by Dick French; however, the gold remained undiscovered. In some minds the gold was to be found on either the Zuni or Navajo reservations, but the laws preventing the acquisition of mineral rights in these regions have discouraged searching. There are other sites, but the leading candidates in the popular imagination are mentioned above. If it really exists, its traditional location remains within \\"Apacheria\\" or the southwest quadrant of New Mexico and bordering areas in Arizona. The complexity of the story is detailed in Jack Purcell's definitive book on the subject, The Lost Adams Diggings: Myth, Mystery, and Madness. This work, unlike its predecessors, is a serious attempt to give historical perspective supported by cited research. Purcell believes that the gold exists and is perhaps somewhere in the mountains just south of Quemado, New Mexico. Perhaps gold will be found someday, but in the minds of most, the legend is fading away among the other items in the forgotten annals of American lore.  Legacy  The many stories arising or deriving from the lost diggings have inspired many to search for lost Apache gold ever since. Its legend has supplied many folk tales, stories and books with ample fuel for fantasies of lost treasures, hidden canyons, Apache secrets and gold \\"somewhere out there\\" in the wilds. Another supposed Indian name for the mine was \\"Sno-Ta-Hay,\\" which supposedly means \\"there it lies\\" i.e. the gold is on the ground and can be picked up or panned as a placer mine. Chief Nana supposedly called it that when he first warned the Adams party before the attack. As previously mentioned, J. Frank Dobie devoted half of his book \\"Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver\\" (now in its ninth printing) to the story of the Lost Adams Diggings and considered it to be the greatest \\"lost mine\\" story of US history. The amount of mail being sent to western New Mexico during the 1930s prompted the government to create a new post office in the area affectionately named \\"Lost Adams Diggings, NM;\\" the post office has since closed. The 1963 novel MacKenna's Gold by Heck Allen is loosely based on the Adams legend. The novel was made into a film in 1969 with the title Mackenna's Gold. Numerous other books about, or based on, the diggings have been written. The legend was dramatized on a 1991 episode of Unsolved Mysteries. References * J. Frank Dobie, Apache Gold & Yaqui Silver.

For DC Comics, Workman lettered Doom Patrol from 1987‚Äì1995, the Legion of Super-Heroes from 1991‚Äì1993, Michael Moorcock's Multiverse in 1997‚Äì1998, and Aquaman in 1999‚Äì2000. Workman handled lettering chores for Topps Comics' X-Files titles in the late 1990s, and Image Comics' Savage Dragon from 2003‚Äì2005. Since 2003, he has done a lot of lettering work for Archie Comics, especially for their Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man titles. He has created logos for many of their super-hero characters and has done interior lettering on both New Crusaders and The Fox. Walt Simonson Workman has worked on many of Walt Simonson‚Äôs projects, including Thor (Marvel, 1983‚Äì1987), Balder the Brave (Marvel, 1985), Jurassic Park (Topps, 1993), Robocop vs. Terminator, Star Slammers (Bravura/Malibu, 1994), Orion (DC, 2000‚Äì2002), and \\"Ragnarok.\\" Tommy Lee Edwards Recently Workman has lettered much of the Marvel, DC and Wildstorm work of Tommy Lee Edwards, including Gemini Blood (1996‚Äì1997), The Question (2005), Bullet Points (2007), Turf, Marvel 1985 (2008) for which he won the 2009 Harvey Award for lettering, and DC's \\"Mother Panic\\" (2016).\\" =Writing, artwork and design= In addition to the thousands of comics pages that he has lettered, Workman has also written and/or drawn for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Archie Comics, National Lampoon, Playboy, Hamilton Publishing, Image Comics, and others. He wrote an introduction and the final chapter in Bhob Stewart's Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood and contributed a short autobiographical piece in comics form to the TwoMorrows book Streetwise. Working in an art style similar to that of artist Mike Sekowsky, he pencilled and inked three of the dust jackets for the hardcover DC Comics Justice League Archives series. He wrote and drew the 41-page \\"Adventures of Roma\\" which ran in consecutive issues of Dark Horse Presents in 1987. Workman's early science fiction and girlie-humor strips \\"Sindy\\" and \\"The Fallen Angels\\" were collected in a five-issue run by Forbidden Fruit, an imprint of Apple Comics. Wild Things, a three-issue series published by Metro Comics, was made up mostly of material created by Workman for such diverse publications as Star*Reach and Heavy Metal. In July 2013, a reformatted graphic novel version of \\"The Adventures of Roma\\" with new art and additional story material was published in both hardbound and softcover editions by CO2 Comics. For the Fantagraphics imprint Eros Comix, Workman wrote and designed Betty Being Bad (1990), a 48-page booklet about pin-up model Betty Page. He also wrote and designed two hardcovers for Heavy Metal Books, Heavy Metal: 25 Years of Classic Covers and Innocent Images. A self-published booklet,\\"The Comic Book Crisis,\\" which examined the business side of comic books was incorporated (with additional new material) into issue 199 of The Comics Journal, featuring commentary by Mike Friedrich, Steve Geppi, Kurt Busiek, Gary Groth and others. Through his own Neonarcheos Publishing imprint, Workman has published limited editions of \\"Writing, Penciling, Inking, Lettering, Editing Martelaine,\\" \\"The Third Man,\\" \\"The Art of John Workman,\\" and both black-and-white and color posters of pages of his artwork. Lettering style Workman is noted for his distinct lettering style, tight craftsmanship, and the fact that for the most part he still does traditional lettering on art boards instead of using the computer and digital fonts. One of Workman's lettering trademarks is to often erase or omit panel borders when they touch the top, side or bottom of a word balloon or caption, thus opening up the balloon/caption to the gutter. In this regard, Workman's lettering style is similar to that of the late Bill Oakley. Workman's lettering style was highly influenced by the lettering of Jean \\"Moebius\\" Giraud from the time when Moebius appeared regularly in the pages of Heavy Metal. Because he does most of his lettering by hand, Workman's collaboration is sought by those artists who wish to have a more cohesive and integrated look to the final artwork. (A joke in the comic book community goes that \\"Comic books are the only place where having 'Workmanlike' craftsmanship is a plus.\\") Recently, however, even Workman has moved toward digital lettering. In addition to his \\"on-the-art boards work,\\" Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a WACOM tablet for such books as Torchwood, Mega Man, Thor, Turf, DC's \\"Before Watchmen\\" series Ozymandias, Superman: American Alien, and the latest incarnation of the Batman title. Personal life Workman is married to the former Cathy Foster, whom he met at Aberdeen's Eaton's Bookstall when she was looking for issues of Lois Lane drawn by Kurt Schaffenberger,Voger, Mark. Hero Gets Girl!: The Life & Art of Kurt Schaffenberger (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2003). and the two have a daughter named Kate, a writer who is the author of two Sherlock Holmes novels. His brother Bill worked beside him on-staff at Heavy Metal magazine. Both were in the 2000 Jon Cryer film Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five.

Sound Laboratory), sometimes credited as Laboratorija (Laboratory) only, was a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band. Noted for their eccentric style, erotic lyrics, unusual line ups and bizarre circus-inspired stage performances, Laboratorija Zvuka were one of the pioneers of the Serbian and former Yugoslav alternative rock scenes. History =1970s and 1980s= The band's history begins in 1977, when brothers Predrag (an architect and former film critic, formerly a member of The Best of Nothing and Med) and Mladen Vrane≈°eviƒá (a former Falkoni and Neoplanti member) decided to form a band. The brothers previously worked together on music for films, theatre plays, radio and TV shows. They started working together in 1971, when they wrote music for Karpo Godina's short film Zdravi ljudi za razonodu (Healthy People for Recreation), on the lyrics of poet and musician Branko Andriƒá. For the music they were awarded on the Festival of Short and Documentary Film, which motivated them to continue composing, often receiving awards for their music in Yugoslavia and abroad. They wrote music for numerous films, including The Medusa Raft, Ve≈°taƒçki raj (Artificial Paradise), Jo≈° ovaj put (One Last Time), Kraj rata (End of the War), Oktoberfest, The Original of the Forgery, Full Moon Over Belgrade, and numerous TV shows, including Poletarac, Priƒçe iz Nepriƒçave, Fore i fazoni, ƒåik pogodi ko sam, Lutkomedija.

With the song \\"Dok vam je jo≈° vreme\\" (\\"While You Still Can\\") they appeared on the Opatija Festival. After the success of the single, they recorded their debut album. Telo (The Body), released through Jugoton in 1980,Telo at Discogs was a concept album, with the A-side entitled Vrline (Virtues),Telo at Discogs featuring the songs which celebrated asceticism and healthy lifestyle, and the B-side, entitled Poroci (Vices),Telo at Discogs featuring songs about bodily pleasures.

While the band was playing, ƒåelik was practicing his bodybuilding using various training devices. In 1980 the band released the 7\\" single featuring their biggest hit, the ska song \\"Ska-kavac joj za≈°'o u rukavac\\" (\\"Grasshopper Got in Her Sleeve\\"), which featured quotes from Crven ban, a collection of erotic folk poetry compiled by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá. The song also featured the debut appearance of the band's mascot, Vilmo≈° Kauboj (Vilmo≈° the Cowboy), real name Vilmo≈° Lakato≈°, a marginal character from the streets of Novi Sad, who toured with the band as an announcer. The band's following album, Duboko u tebi (Deep inside You), released through Jugoton in 1982,Duboko u tebi at Discogs featured elements of rockabilly. The song \\"Zaboravljena draga\\" (\\"The Forgotten Beloved\\") was recorded for Zoran Amar's film Piknik u Topoli (Picnic in Topola), featuring lyrics written by Predrag Vrane≈°eviƒá and Slobodan Ti≈°ma, the member of Luna, and a former member of La Strada. However, as Ti≈°ma did not want to be known that he worked on the song lyrics, he was signed on the album as Bobo Misteriozo. The album also featured a cover of Larry Williams' \\"Bony Moronie\\", and \\"Odlazim dolazim\\" (\\"I'm Leaving I'm Coming\\"), recorded live in 1978, on the band's performance on the Subotica Festival Omladina.Duboko u tebi at Discogs At the time, the band's new members became De≈æe Molnar (saxophone), and Miroslav Cvetkoviƒá \\"Pis\\" (guitar).

In 1982, Predrag Vrane≈°eviƒá, in the name of the band, was charged because the band \\"insulted socialist moral and hurt patriotic feelings\\" of the citizens of Novo Mesto, SR Slovenia. Some citizens of Novo Mesto saw a poster announcing Laboratorija Zvuka concert and thought that the image of Vilmo≈° Kauboj insults the image of president Josip Broz Tito. Predrag Vrane≈°eviƒá was sentenced to 40 days in prison, but the whole case was soon hushed up as absurd and all charges were dropped. In 1983 the band performed in Germany once again, and after a performance at the Zagreb Bienale Festival, which that year featured the bands Gang of Four and Classix Nouveaux, established contacts with English managers, and in August 1984 went to London, and during five evenings they performed in the Institute of Contemporary Arts, under the name La Boratoria.

She is best known for roles with Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy Opera Company and with the Carl Rosa Opera Company. Early life and career Born Julia Ehrenberg, her stage name came from her birthplace, Warwick Street, in Regent's Park, Camden, London. Her father Jacob Ehrenberg was a Jewish tailor from Poland, and her mother was Evelina n√©e Elias. Warwick and her two sisters were all interested in music. She originally intended to be a pianist, studying with Sigismond Lehmeyer, and playing at the Hanover Square Rooms and the Beethoven Rooms as early as 1869, when she was only 12 years old, and then at St. George's Hall in 1872. She then studied singing under Madame Sainton-Dolby and sang regularly at the Berkeley Street Synagogue with her elder sister Annie (died 1897). By 1873, the teenager was performing with the Kilburn Musical Society in William Jackson's oratorio Isaiah and, later that year, in the Covent Garden promenade concerts. She soon sang at the Royal Albert Hall in Elijah with William Carter's choir.

Unlike the bullpup QBZ-95, the QBZ-03 is a weapon of conventional design. The weapon is designed to be easily used by soldiers already familiar with previously issued rifles and machine guns. Design The QBZ-03 has a two-piece receiver largely made up of forged aluminum alloy with the stock, pistol grip, and handguards being made of a polymer compound. The gas block has a two position regulator, one for firing standard ammunition, the other to allow the use of rifle grenades. The sights are of a hooded front sight with a flip up rear diopter sight similar to the American M16 rifle. A scope rail is available to allow the use of various optics. The QBZ-03 has seen some issue within the People's Armed Police, People's Liberation Army Marine Corps, People's Liberation Army Air Force Paratroopers, and second line PLA ground units. The weapon has a faster rate of fire compare to QBZ-95. Operating system is similar to Type 81 assault rifle featuring rotating bolt locking and short-stroke gas piston.

The 5.8 mile long tunnel diverts water from the Gunnison River to the arid Uncompahgre Valley around Montrose, Colorado. Celebration on opening of the Gunnison Tunnel, 1909 (in Montrose, not at the tunnel itself) At the time of its completion, it was the longest irrigation tunnel in the world and quickly made the area around Montrose into profitable agricultural lands. In 1972, the tunnel was designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The idea for a tunnel is credited to Frank Lauzon, a miner and prospector. By the early 1890s he was farming in Montrose. Popular lore is that idea came to him in a dream that the waters of the Gunnison River should be brought to the valley. As construction was undertaken, two advances in technology made work safer and easier. Jackhammers fed by a compressor replaced hand-turned drill bits to set holes for blasting charges. Dynamite replaced black powder for blasting. By 1906 shifts of workers up to 30 at a time worked in the tunnel. The tunnel opened in 1909 to much fanfare with a dedication ceremony attended by President William Howard Taft. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. With . The tunnel is long and is in cross-section, with square corners at the bottom and an arched roof. It drops about over its length. At the deepest, it is about beneath the surface of Vernal Mesa.

It was written in 1924 and first published in 1925. The novel became quite popular, but was much criticised by most Soviet critics as a mockery of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the leadership of Soviet Russia. Background By 1924, Bulgakov was relatively well known as a writer. He had published several short stories, including Dyavoliada, in some ways a precursor to Master and Margarita, and started publishing his first novel, The White Guard. The Fatal Eggs was finished in early October 1924 Bulgakov's biography 1921‚Äì1930 at www.bulgakov.ru and published in the Nedra journal in February 1925; a shortened edition was also published in May‚ÄìJune 1925 in the Krasnaya Panorama journal, under the title The Ray of Life (Russian: –õ—É—á –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏). Bulgakov also read the novel on several occasions to various social gatherings, where it met with favorable reception. Plot summary The Fatal Eggs can be described as a satirical science fiction novel. Its main protagonist is an aging zoologist, Vladimir Ipatyevich Persikov, a specialist in amphibians. The narration begins in Moscow of 1928, which seems to have overcome the destructive effects of the Russian Civil War and is quite prosperous. After a long period of degradation, research at the Zoological Institute has revived. After leaving his microscope for several hours, Persikov suddenly noticed that the out-of-focus microscope produced a ray of red light; amoeba left under that light showed an impossibly increased rate of binary fission, reproducing at enormous speeds and demonstrating unusual aggression. Later experiments with large cameras ‚Äî to produce a larger ray ‚Äî confirmed that the same increased speed of reproduction applied to other organisms, such as frogs, which evolved and produced a next generation within two days. Persikov's invention quickly becomes known to journalists, and eventually to foreign spies and to the GPU, the Soviet secret service. At the same time, the country is affected by an unknown disease in domesticated poultry, which results in a complete extinction of all chickens in the Soviet Russia, with the plague stopping at the nation's borders. A sovkhoz manager Aleksandr Semenovich Rokk (whose name is also a pun on the novel's title, Rok meaning fate) receives an official permission to confiscate Persikov's equipment, and use the invention to attempt to restore the chicken populace to the pre-plague level. However, the chicken eggs which are imported from outside the country are, by a mistake, sent to Persikov's laboratory while the reptile eggs destined for the professor end up in the hands of the farmers. As a result, Rokk breeds an enormous quantity of large and overly aggressive snakes, ostriches, and crocodiles which start attacking people. In the panic that follows, Persikov is killed by a mob ‚Äî which blames him for the appearance of the snakes ‚Äî and his cameras are smashed. The Red Army attempts to hold the snakes back, but only the coming of sub-zero weather in August‚Äîdescribed as a deus ex machina‚Äîputs a stop to the snake invasion. In an earlier draft the novel ends with the scene of Moscow's complete destruction by the snakes. \\"The Fatal Eggs\\" article in Bulgakov Encyclopedia at www.bulgakov.ru Analysis and critical reception A number of influences on the novel can be detected. One of the sources behind The Fatal Eggs was H. G. Wells's 1904 novel The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth, where two scientists discover a way to accelerate growth ‚Äî which at first results in a plague of gigantic chickens, and eventually in an all-out war between people affected by growth and those who are not. The novel is in fact referenced in the text of the novel in a conversation between Persikov and his assistant. It has also been noted that the death of the snakes from cold weather though they successfully resisted the military force is reminiscent of the death of aliens from a pathogen bacteria in The War of the Worlds. Other influences may include rumours of \\"a giant reptile [in the Crimea], to capture which a regiment of Red Guards was deployed\\". The events of The Fatal Eggs were usually seen as a critique of Soviet Russia. Indeed, there was a case to be made for Professor Persikov's identification with Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (note the similarity in names), as both of them can be said to have unleashed destruction on Russia, and there seem to be similarities between them both in appearance and character. \\"The Fatal Eggs\\" article in Bulgakov Encyclopedia, page 2 at www.bulgakov.ru Chicken plague and the sanitary cordons that foreign countries established against it were seen as a parody of the ideas of internationalism and the policy of the Entente against it. Although Bulgakov was not repressed, from 1925 he was questioned by the GPU several times and was never allowed to leave the Soviet Union, possibly as a result of his negative image which was at least partly due to the publication of The Fatal Eggs. \\"The Fatal Eggs\\" article in Bulgakov Encyclopedia, page 3 at www.bulgakov.ru Although there were positive responses, upon the whole the novel was viewed as dangerous and anti-Soviet. Bulgakov was aware that the story might be displeasing to the authorities ‚Äì after presenting the story at a literary evening in late 1924, he wrote in his diary: 'Is it a satire? Or a provocative gesture? ... I'm afraid that I might be hauled off ... for all these heroic feats.'

Characters  ; Marion : A handsome, clever student of the certain school in France. He falls madly in love with the much older Sara, to whom he loses his virginity. He stays as her lover for some time, all the while knowing that the love would never be permanent due to Sara being married to Count Cluny. He rejects the affections of both Ledania and Claude because of his love for Sara. Claude ends up committing suicide over the rejection, something that Marion deeply regrets. When Sara finally breaks off their relationship, Marion is heartbroken, not just for Sara, but for the loss of Claude as well. He becomes gravely injured attempting to stop the duel between Lind and Jacques, and in the end is sent back to his family. ; Jacques : Marion's friend and classmate. In contrast to his friends, Jacques is a simple boy from the countryside. He is stubborn yet optimistic.

K. Narayan. Plot One of Narayan's later works, the Painter of Signs is a bittersweet novel that looks at the lives of Raman, a painter of sign boards, and Daisy, a social worker interested in curtailing India's population growth. The story is set in Malgudi, like many of Narayan's works with the Sarayu, Ellaman street and The Boardless Hotel being significant landmarks in the novel. At its very core, The Painter of Signs is Raman and Daisy's progressive love story in a conservative town in South India. Raman is a sign-painter who takes the art of calligraphy very seriously. He devotedly creates the perfect signboard for all his customers, taking great care in the styling of words on the board. Made using the \\"best rosewood\\" from the Mempi mountains, Raman believes that his signboards are a notch above his rival Jayaraj's. Living with his aunt, a conservative old woman who likes to ramble about mythological stories and old family gossip, on Ellaman Street, Raman goes through periods of frustration at his aunt's interest in his going abouts and feelings of guilt for ignoring her affection and presence. Not orthodox himself, Raman neither sports a tuft like others from his caste nor has inhibitions in eating meat if necessary. He looks down on superstitions and old-fashioned notions of religion and caste and spends his time reading ancient copies of books on science and history. He does have a tendency to quote from the scriptures and make associations with events in the scriptures and those in his life. Daisy, an intense young woman involved in family planning campaigns, hires Raman to make a signboard for her office. For no reason whatsoever, Raman finds himself bewitched by her beauty, and more so by her precision, authority and her devotion to her career. It so happens that he has to accompany Daisy on a three-week campaign in the villages around Malgudi to identify potential sites where he can paint signs and messages on population control and finds himself further attracted to her firmness, simplicity, and her tendency to shun luxuries and comforts of all sorts. He finds that his resolve to remain unmarried, seeing marriage as commonplace and unnecessary, is weakening. The story goes on to outline Daisy's complicated past and her eventual admission of a mutual attraction for Raman. The two start spending the nights together, and decide to get married in the (\\"Gandharva\\" style),the simplest form of marital union. Daisy seems to be unaffected by the relationship though, and tells Raman that she will not change her last name, or house-keep for him. Raman mulls over the eventualities of such a wedlock, but is steadfast in his affection and love for Daisy and constantly tells himself that her needs and wishes will always be more important than his. His aunt, upset over her nephew's unorthodox afflictions - especially at his decision to marry out of caste - asks him to arrange a one way trip to Benaras for her. His repeated beseechings to her to stay and bless him and Daisy have no effect. On the morning that Daisy is to move into Raman's house on Ellaman Street, she changes her mind about Raman, feeling that her sense of purpose and her independent existence may be affected by married life. She decides to leave Malgudi for a three-year family planning initiative in villages all over India. Confused and befuddled, Raman tries his best to convince her, telling her that his house on Ellaman street will be open for her whenever' she decides to return. The Painter of Signs is preoccupied with the complications of human characters and human relationships. As Raman finds himself being torn between his Aunt and Daisy, the traditional way and the modern way, we see the protagonist as being \\"in- between\\" in the town of Malgudi. At the end of the novel, Raman's aunt left for Benares on a pilgrimage and Daisy left the town of Malgudi to pursue her career which means that Raman is left alone in Malgudi. This depicts the fact that it seems as though Raman cannot facilitate either women or what they represent (traditionality and modernity respectively), thus presenting the problematic themes of human character and their relationships with one another.

The cult of the fresh waters appears to have been particularly important among Gauls, and Celts in general, compared to the rest of Indo- European traditions. Name The name Divona ('Divine') is a derivative of the Gaulish word deuos ('god'). Toponymic evidence suggest that sacred springs have been named for the deity, such as Dƒìou√≥na (ŒîŒ∑ŒøœÖœåŒΩŒ±), the ancient name of Cahors, or Divonne and Fosse Dionne. Attestation and cult practices In ancient Roman religion, goddesses of freshwater sources are often associated with the deity Fons, god of fountains and wellheads, honored at the Fontinalia for his role in the public water supply for the city. Ausonius invokes fons, the manmade outlet that makes the water available to the people, with a string of adjectives: sacer, alme, perennis, / vitree, glauce, profunde, sonore, illimis, opace,Ausonius, Ordo nobilium urbium 20.30‚Äì31 (Green lines 157‚Äì158). The adjectives are masculine to agree with fons and appear in the vocative case, as is customary for a Latin invocation. \\"sacred, life-giving, eternal, / glassy, blue-green,The color word glaucus (Greek glaukos) evokes a range of grey, green, and blue indeterminately, and can often be translated as \\"sea- colored\\" or even \\"sky-colored.\\" It has divine connotations and is associated with various deities, for instance, as the color of Athena's eyes. See P.G. Maxwell-Stuart, Studies in Greek Colour Terminology: ŒìŒõŒëŒ•ŒöŒüŒ£ (Brill, 1981), vol. 1, pp. 40‚Äì42, and a brief discussion of the color as associated with Pluto. measureless, sonorous, free of mud, shaded.\\" He hails fons as the \\"Genius of the city\\" (urbis genius) having the power to offer a healing draught (medico potabilis haustu). In the next line, Ausonius says that this genius or tutelary deity is Divona in the Celtic language (Divona Celtarum lingua), that is, fons added to the divae (plural).The phrase fons addite divis is somewhat difficult to interpret. It is sometimes construed as \\"fons\\" addite \\"divis\\", that is \\"Add (plural imperative) the word fons to the word divae/divi\\" (masculine singular divus). In the plural dative and ablative cases, the masculine and feminine forms are the same, and divis could be either, but Ausonius seems to be connecting the masculine fons to the feminine Divona. In Latin, the word lymphae, plural, means \\"waters\\" but is also an Italic word for \\"nymphs\\"; a plural divae here might suggest the same tendency to regard water nymphs as both a singular and a plural collective. The verbal form addite, however, can also be construed as a perfect passive participle in the vocative case, parallel in construction with the string of vocative adjectives, that is, \\"Fons, added to the goddesses.\\" Ausonius \\"hails\\" (salve) the \\"Genius of the city,\\" but genius is not in the vocative case. Fons addite divis is sometimes taken as a proffered etymology: Ausonius may be proposing that the word Divona is formed from the word divus, Gaulish devos, plus fons = -ona, taking fons as the equivalent of a Gaulish word onno, \\"stream, river,\\" the existence of which is doubtful. The suffix -ona is found in the names of several Gallic goddesses.

Evans was sentenced in 1987 to 40 years in prison for using false identification to buy firearms and for harboring a fugitive in the 1981 Brinks armored truck robbery, in which two police officers and a guard were killed, and Black Liberation Army members were wounded. In a second case, she was sentenced in 1990 to five years in prison for conspiracy and malicious destruction in connection with eight bombings including the 1983 United States Senate bombing, carried out at night so that no persons were harmed. Her sentence was commuted in 2001 by President Bill Clinton because of its extraordinary length.Former Terrorist Is Among Those Pardoned or Freed in Clinton's Final Acts in Office The New York Times, January 21, 2001BRINK'S SUSPECT HELD WITHOUT BAIL AFTER SHE REFUSES TO ENTER A PLEA The New York Times, May 14, 1985 Students for a Democratic Society Evans began her life as an activist by organizing demonstrations at Michigan State University during 1965.PARC In 1967 Evans became a member of the East Coast chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).FBI files, 284 She stated that she became interested in the civil rights movement after getting attacked by police during a demonstration at the Pentagon.Armed the Spirit \\"When I first became a political activist, I was a pacifist. I had never experience real violence in my own life and naively hoped that it changed.\\"James, 274 Evans demonstrated her interest in anti-racism movements by supporting various groups championing Black, Native and Puerto Rican liberation causes. Evans' leadership role in SDS began after a conference held on July 15, 1969 at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. At this she announced that she would be traveling with six other anti-war activists to Hanoi to participate in the release of three U.S pilots who were being held as prisoners of war.FBI files, 283Jacobin Books, 378 At this conference, she also read a statement from SDS which declared the organization's support for the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Almost a month later, on August 7, 1969, Evans returned from Hanoi along with the prisoners of war through Trans World Airlines.FBI files, 285 Soon after Evans return from Hanoi, SDS held various conferences so that she could relate her experiences in Hanoi. During these conferences Evans stated that \\"SDS is on the side of North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front\\", called out the U.S. as the aggressor, and spoke of the \\"extremely humane treatment\\" given to captured American GIs. To conclude many of her appearances, she mentioned how willing the Vietnamese women and children were to bear arms in order to fight for their cause, and told of seeing an antiaircraft gun operated by Viet Cong women, cradling the gun in her arms and \\"wishing that an American plane would come over.\\"FBI files, 109 Two of these conferences were notable for their high attendance. One took place at St. Joseph's Episcopal Church in Detroit on August 11, 1969, while the other took place at Cleveland during the SDS National Conference held August 29 through September 1, 1969. While at the SDS national convention, Evans announced her loyalty to Communism. In 1970 Evans was arrested for conspiracy and crossing state lines to incite a riot while organizing for SDS's National Action, more commonly known as the Days of Rage. The charges were dropped after it was disclosed that the government had used illegal wiretaps to obtain evidence.Abilene Reporter Evans was released on a $75,000 bond. After Evans was released from prison in 1970, she moved to Texas where she continued to participate in radical causes. Weather Underground Organization Evans became involved in Weatherman, a group that derived from SDS. She organized and led many Weatherman actions. Following the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion that killed three Weatherman members (Ted Gold, Diana Oughton, and Terry Robbins), Evans was one of the Weatherman members who chose to go underground in 1970.Berger, 57 During her membership in the Weather Underground Organization, Evans provided safe housing for members of the Weather Underground Organization and by providing funding for their assumed identities.Jacobs, 49 She generated these funds through her participation in various robberies. Evans also participated in the May 19th Communist Movement, a group that included some former members of the Weather Underground Organization. On April 15, 1970, Evans and Dianne Donghi were arrested for trying to forge checks using false identification.Berger, 132 The FBI was able to arrest them because of a tip they received from an ex-member of Weatherman named Larry Grathwohl, who was working as an undercover informant for the FBI. Grathwohl's testimony was later used in Evans' final arrest by the FBI to prove that she had repeatedly been involved in illegal activities. Evans' final arrest was on May 11, 1985 for harboring Marilyn Jean Buck, a fugitive in the 1981 Brinks armored truck robbery case, in which two police officers and a guard were murdered. At the time of her arrest, Evans was wearing a wig and glasses to disguise herself. The FBI agents obtained from her purse a Browning 9mm pistol and false documents with the name of Rebecca Ann Morgan, Christine Johnson, and Louise Robinett. The FBI was able to trace the gun to Louisiana, where Linda Evans was found to have purchased four firearms and three boxes of ammunition from three separate businesses under the false identity of Louise Robinett. Having purchased the four guns under a false identification, Evans was charged with eleven violations of the Gun Control Act of 1968. From March 16 to March 20, 1987 she was tried before a jury. Along with the eleven violations charges and housing a fugitive, she was also charged for terrorist actions after 740 pounds of dynamite were found in her apartment along with evidence of a plan to target the U.S Capitol Building, the National War College, the Navy Yard Computer Center, the Navy Yard Officers Club, Israeli Aircraft Industries, the FBI and the New York Patrolman's Benevolent Association.Nation Master On March 20, 1987 she was found guilty of all charges and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.Prison Activist While incarcerated at the Federal Corrections Institution in Dublin, Evans advocated for an AIDS educational program for women and lesbian inmates.Staajabu, 1 She helped raise funds for the program by creating quilts and served as a peer AIDS counselor and educator.PARC, 262 Evans advocated for inmates' rights,James, 276 claiming that \\"When I was in jail in Louisiana we were able to win a jail house lawyer's legal suit forcing the jail to give women glasses and false teeth\\".

It is known as visna when found in the brain, and maedi when infecting the lungs. Lifelong, persistent infections in sheep occur in the lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, joints, central nervous system, and mammary glands; The condition is sometimes known as \\"ovine progressive pneumonia\\" (OPP), particularly in the United States, or \\"Montana sheep disease\\". White blood cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are the main target of visna virus. Viral infection First described in 1954 by Bjorn Sigurdsson in Iceland, Maedi-visna virus was the first lentivirus to be isolated and characterized, accomplished in 1957 by Sigurdsson. Maedi (Icelandic ' meaning dyspnoea) and visna (Icelandic ' mening \\"wasting\\" or \\"shrinking\\" of the spinal cord) refer to endemic sheep herd conditions that were only found to be related after Sigurdsson's work. Visna infection may progress to total paralysis leading to death via inanition; however, if given assistance in eating and drinking, infected animals may survive for long periods of time, sometimes greater than ten years. Viral replication is almost exclusively associated with macrophages in infected tissues; however, replication is restricted in these cells--that is, the majority of cells containing viral RNA do not produce infectious virus. The disease was introduced to Iceland following an import of Karakul sheep from Germany in 1933. The susceptibility to maedi-visna infection varies across sheep breeds, with coarse-wool breeds apparently more susceptible than fine-wool sheep. Attempts at vaccination against maedi-visna virus have failed to induce immunity, occasionally causing increased viremia and more severe disease. Eradication programs have been established in countries worldwide. Associated diseases and symptoms Visna ‚Äì Maedi is a chronic viral disease prevalent in adult sheep. The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat. Maedi Visna virus is also referred to as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same Maedi in a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. Visna refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis in adult sheep. This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems. Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved. Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests. Transmission of the disease occurs most commonly via the oral route caused by ingestion of colostrum or milk that contains the virus or inhalation of infected aerosol droplets. Due to variation of the strains of MVV, some of the association clinical symptoms may be more pre-dominant in a flock relative to others along with differences in genetic susceptibility patterns. Viral replication =Entry= Visna Maedi virus (VMV) belongs to the small ruminant lentivirus group (SRLV). In general, SRLVs enter the cell through the interaction of their glycosylated envelope protein with a cellular receptor on the cell's plasma membrane facilitating fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. However, the specific cellular receptor that VMV binds is not entirely certain. A few studies have proposed MHC class II, CD4 and CXCR4 proteins as possible receptors however, none of these proteins have been established as the main receptor. Another study suggests that C-type lectins part of the mannose receptor (MR) family play a role as an alternative SRLV receptor. The mannose receptor is a 180-kDa transmembrane protein with eight tandem C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of which CRD4 and CRD5 are essential in recognizing mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine residues. Studies suggest that VMV gains entrance to the cell via mannosylated residues on its envelope proteins. MR is involved in recognizing the surface of pathogens and is involved in phago- and endocytosis and mediating antigen processing and presentation in a variety of cells including monocyte/macrophages and endothelial cells. =Replication= Visna Maedi virus is a retrovirus meaning its genome consists of a (+)RNA that undergoes reverse transcription and then is integrated into the host's genome after infection. This integration is what leads to VMV's lifelong persistent infection. VMV has a long incubation period. During the initial outbreak among sheep in Iceland, there was no sign of clinical disease until six years after the importation of the Karakul sheep, which brought the virus from Germany to Iceland. Susceptibility to infection also increases with a higher level. VMV infects cells of the monocyte lineage, but only replicates at high levels when the monocytes are more mature/differentiated. of maturity/differentiation of the monocytes. Infected differentiated monocytes, also known as macrophages, will continuously present VMV antigens inducing T-lymphocytes to produce cytokines that in turn induce the differentiation of monocytes. Viral transmission =Horizontal transmission= Horizontal transmission plays an important role among livestock due to their often close quarters, especially during winter stabling. Free virus or virus infected cells are generally transferred in through inhalation of respiratory secretions. Additionally, fecal-oral transmission often occurs through contamination of drinking water.http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D1226.PDF Sexual transmission has also been shown to be possible No link has yet been made between transmission and other excretory products such as saliva and urine. =Vertical transmission= In endemically infected flocks of livestock, free virus and virus infected cells are passed through from mothers to lambs via colostrum and milk. This is one of the key features in affected populations, as it contributes greatly to the virus becoming endemic in the flock. Lambs are extremely vulnerable to infection due to the permeability of the guts of newborns Houwers, D. J. Epidemiology, diagnosis and control of SRLVinfections. Universidad de Zaragoza. 1997.

Virions consist of an icosahedral capsid surrounded by an envelope derived from the host plasma membrane. Inside the capsid are the nucleoprotein-genome complex and the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes. A crystal structure of the virion has not been obtained and the triangulation number of the icosahedron is unknown. Tropism The term viral tropism refers to the cell types a virus infects. Visna virus is generally known to target cells of the immune system, mainly monocytes and their mature form, macrophages. Studies suggest that the amount of viral replication appears to have a direct correlation with the maturity of the infected cells, with relatively little virus replication in monocytes when compared to more mature macrophages. Infection can also occur in mammary epithelial and endothelial cells, implying mammary glands as a main viral reservoir, showing the importance that vertical transmission plays in the spread of the virus. Genome structure Visna virus has a positive-strand RNA genome approximately 9.2 kilobases in length. As a retrovirus in the genus lentivirinae, the genome is reverse transcribed into proviral DNA. The visna virus genome resembles that of other lentiviruses, in terms of the gene functions that are present. Visna virus is closely related to the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus but has limited nucleotide sequence similarity with other lentiviruses. The visna viral genome encodes three structural genes characteristic of retroviruses, gag (group specific antigen), pol (polymerase), and env (envelope protein). The genome also encodes two regulatory proteins, tat (trans-activator of transcription) and rev (regulator of virion protein expression). A rev response element (RRE) exists inside the env gene. An auxiliary gene, vif (viral infectivity factor), is also encoded. However, the number and role of auxiliary genes varies by strain of visna virus. The genome sequence is flanked by 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô long terminal repeats (LTRs). The viral LTRs are essential for viral transcription. The LTRs include a TATA box at the -20 position and a recognition site for the AP-4 transcription factor at the -60 position. There are several AP-1 transcription factor binding sites in the viral LTRs. The closest AP-1 binding site is bound by the Jun and Fos proteins to activate transcription. A duplicated motif in the visna virus LTR is associated with cell tropism and neurovirulence. The gag gene encodes three final glycoprotein products: the capsid, the nucleocapsid, and the matrix protein which links the capsid and the envelope. The env gene is translated into a single precursor polyprotein that is cleaved by a host protease into two proteins, the surface glycoprotein and the transmembrane glycoprotein. The transmembrane glycoprotein is anchored inside the envelope lipid bilayer while the surface glycoprotein is non-covalently linked to the transmembrane glycoprotein. The pol gene encodes five enzymatic functions: a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, dUTPase, integrase, and protease. The reverse transcriptase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that exists as a heterodimer protein with RNase H activity. The dUTPase enzyme is not present in all lentiviruses. The role of the dUTPase in the visna virus life cycle is unclear. dUTPase-deficient visna virus knockout strains show no decrease in pathogenicity in vivo. The integrase enzyme exists inside the viral capsid, facilitating integration into the host chromosome after entry and virion uncoating. The protease cleaves the gag and pol polyprotein precursor. The viral tat gene encodes a 94-amino acid protein. Tat is the most enigmatic of the proteins of the visna virus. Most studies have indicated that Tat is a transcription factor necessary for viral transcription from the LTRs. Tat contains both a suppressor domain and a powerful acidic activator domain on the N-terminus. It has been suggested that Tat interacts with the cellular AP-1 transcription factors Fos and Jun to bind to the TATA-binding protein and activate transcription. However, other studies have suggested that the visna virus \\"Tat\\" protein is not a trans-activator for transcription but instead exhibits a function involved in cell cycle arrest, making it more closely related to the HIV-1 Vpr protein than Tat. The viral rev gene encodes a post- transcriptional regulatory protein. Rev is required for expression of unspliced or partially spliced mRNA coding for the viral envelope protein, including gag and env in a similar manner as the HIV Rev protein. Rev binds as a multimer to the Rev Response Element (RRE) which has a stem-loop secondary structure. The function of the auxiliary gene vif is not fully known. The vif gene product, a 29 kDa protein, induces a weak immune response in animals. Deletion experiments have demonstrated that the vif gene is essential for infectivity. The maedi-visna control programme of the Swedish Board of Agriculture Model system for HIV infection Though it does not produce severe immunodeficiency, visna shares many characteristics with human immunodeficiency virus, including the establishment of persistent infection with chronic active lymphoproliferation; however, visna virus does not infect T-lymphocytes. The relationship of visna and HIV as lentiviruses was first published in 1985 by visna researcher Janice E. Clements and colleagues in the HIV field. It has been postulated that the effects of maedi-visna infection in sheep are the \\"equivalent\\" of central nervous system disease and wasting syndrome found in human AIDS patients. Despite limited sequence homology with HIV, the genomic organization of visna is very similar, allowing visna infection to be used as an in vivoAdv Pharmacol. 2000;49:315-85. \\"HIV-1-associated central nervous system dysfunction.\\" Krebs FC, Ross H, McAllister J, Wigdahl B. and in vitro model system for HIV infection. Research using visna was important in the identification and characterization of HIV. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that the AIDS virus was a retrovirus related to visna and provided early clues as to the mechanism of HIV infection. Control programs Many countries have some sort of national programme to prevent and control a situation where the virus spreads. These programs include: *Frequent serological testing- Aids in a fast diagnosis. *Removal of seropositive animals from breeding program *Separation of animal born to seropositive dam (milk re-placer). *Quarantine of animal before introduction into herd. *Disinfection (sensitive).

Barton, Aristocracy, 276 n.1.) was a Castilian nobleman, count of Li√©bana, Salda√±a and Carri√≥n in the closing decades of the eleventh century and the opening decades of the twelfth. He is considered the founder and first lord of Valladolid. Pedro was a descendant of the Beni G√≥mez family of Castilian nobility, the son of Ansur D√≠az, by his first wife, whose name is unknown.Torres Sevilla-Qui√±ones de Le√≥n, Margarita, Linajes nobiliarios de Le√≥n y Castilla: Siglos IX-XIII, Salamanca: Junta de Castilla y Le√≥n, Consejer√≠a de educaci√≥n y cultura, 1999, pp. 142 and 144. His grandfather, Diego Fern√°ndez, was a count of Salda√±a and Carri√≥n. Pedro married twice, the first time by 17 June 1084Barton, Aristocracy, 275‚Äì76. to Elo (or Eylo), daughter of Count Alfonso Mu√±oz and Aldonza Gonz√°lez of Trigueros. She was dead by 17 September 1114, when Pedro made a donation for the good of her soul to the canons of the cathedral of Valladolid, and he appears the next day with his second wife, Elvira S√°nchez, whom he may have wed some time before. Pedro had five children: Alfonso, Fernando, Mar√≠a, Mayor, and Urraca. Alfonso died young and his sarcophagus, commissioned by Pedro, can still be seen in the museum of Sahag√∫n. Pedro and Elo's children were raised in the household of a lesser nobleman: that of Citi √Ålvarez and his wife Froilo, who were duly rewarded for their services with a grant of land.Barton, Aristocracy, 47. Pedro Ans√∫rez planning the Colegiata de Santa Mar√≠a; from a mural by Eugenio Oliva. Pedro was one of the nobles closest to Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile, although the later claim that he was Alfonso's tutor or guardian during his youth must be dismissed, since the king and Pedro were of roughly the same age. During 24 July‚Äì3 September 1067 Pedro served as the majordomo of Alfonso's court. He was raised by the king to the rank of count perhaps as early as 22 November 1068, certainly before 1 November 1070, after which time he always signs charters using the title.The name Petrus Asuriz comes (Count Pedro Ans√∫rez) may be interpolated in the earlier charter, for Pedro is not titled count in charters he witnessed on 26 March and 16 August 1169 and 25 July 1070. Cf. Barton, Aristocracy, 275 n. 5. In 1072, he accompanied Alfonso into exile in Toledo. Later, when Alfonso returned to inherit the kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile, Pedro and Eylo were charged with the repopulation of Valladolid. This they did with men from their counties of Salda√±a and Carri√≥n. However, the city really began to grow when its lordship was given to Pedro some years later. He became a prolific builder, constructing a large palace for himself and his wife, which has not survived, and a hospital. He built a bridge over the Pisuerga and many religious edifices, like the church of Santa Mar√≠a la Antigua and the Colegiata de Santa Mar√≠a, which served as the site of the cathedral (the bishop's seat). The environs of Valladolid formed the outer limits of the Kingdom of Castile at his time and Pedro was responsible for the repopulating of the region between Li√©bana and Cu√©llar. His massive frontier district included the historically significant city of Toledo. In 1095, his lordship included Madrid.Reilly, Urraca, 20. Around 1087, at the time of the marriage of Alfonso's eldest daughter and heiress apparent, Urraca, to Raymond of Burgundy, the king appointed Pedro to be her guardian (tutor), and she stayed at his court according to the later Primera Cr√≥nica General (late 13th century). This probably served to prevent the accumulation of too great influence in the hands of the French.Reilly, Urraca, 14. Towards the end of the century, Pedro's power and influence were diminished by the extension of that of the Capetians Raymond and Henry of Burgundy. When his daughter Mar√≠a was widowed by the Count of Urgel, Ermengol V, Pedro transferred the guardianship of her son, Ermengol VI, to Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona. Between 1103 and 1108, Pedro was in exile in Urgell, having displeased Alfonso VI.Reilly, Alfonso VI, 331‚Äì35. He took an active part in the conquest of Balaguer. Pedro brought with him to Urgell his armour-bearer (armiger), a knight by the name of √ç√±igo P√©rez. Only the greater magnates could afford to employ officers like this. The armiger, or alf√©rez, was responsible for leading Pedro's mesnada (retinue) into battle.Barton, Aristocracy, 59. In 1114, out of fear of Hell, Pedro Ans√∫rez donated some land at Fuensalda√±a to the church of Valladolid.Barton, Aristocracy, 206. In 1143, Sancho Ans√∫rez, Pedro's grandson by his daughter Urraca, introduced the Premonstratensian Order into Spain when he became abbot of Fuentesclaras, moved to Retuerta in 1146. Sancho had studied under Saint Norbert at Pr√©montr√©.Barton, Aristocracy, 197. Notes Sources *Barton, Simon F. The Aristocracy in Twelfth- century Le√≥n and Castile.

The company's primary founders were brothers-in-law Abram Nave and James McCord.  Early history One of four children of Henry B. and Mary (Brooks) Nave, Abram Nave was born June 15, 1815, in Cocke County, Tennessee, and came to Saline County, Missouri, with his family about a year later. In 1841, Abram made his first business venture with $1,000 borrowed from his father. With the capital, he opened a general store in Savannah, a small town located in Andrew County, Missouri. He had arrived in town with a single wagonload of miscellaneous merchandise that he sold in a small building on the west side of the town square. The following year he married Lucy McCord in Saline County. She was born September 30, 1822 in Randolph County, Virginia. They would eventually have six children, two of which died young. In 1846, Abram opened another store under the name Nave & McCord in Oregon, Missouri, with his brother-in-law, James McCord. It was a partnership that would last 52 years, until Abram died. James was born January 7, 1826, in Randolph County, Virginia, one of four children (and only son) of William McCord and Sally Moss Field. He married Mary E. Hallick and they had 10 children. From 1850-57, Abram, James and Dudley M. Steele were partners in the company Steele, McCord & Company that drove cattle, mules and other livestock from Missouri to Sacramento, California, where the animals were sold at a high profit. In the July 19, 1856, issue of the North West Democrat newspaper, it's stated ‚ÄúAbram Nave reached home a few days ago from California. His numerous friends will be glad to hear he is in good health.‚Äù  Company formed  Abram and James formed the wholesale grocery company Nave, McCord & Company in 1857 in St. Joseph, Missouri. By 1860, the company had expanded its operations over an extensive territory and branch offices were soon opened in Omaha, Nebraska (with partner Charles L. Clark), and Kansas City, Missouri. However, despite the company's growth, 1860 would prove to be a disastrous year. On the morning of July 5, 1860, fire broke out in the upper floor of the Nave & McCord building in St. Joseph.\\"The Catastrophe at St. Joseph,\\" The New York Times, July 16, 1860, page 5 The building's walls collapsed before the general alarm was given. The debris completely covered the tenement and nine people perished. Two of Nave & McCord's clerks, who slept in the second story, had a narrow escape. The insurance companies refused to pay the loss on the building upon the grounds that the collapse had occurred before the fire. The case was tried at St. Louis, and after eight years of litigation resulted favorably to Nave & McCord thanks to an eyewitness. A guest at the nearby Patee House had been unable to sleep owing to the hot weather. Seated at his window, he said he noticed the flames and watched the fire for some time before he heard the crash when the building collapsed. Abram and James rebuilt their company and managed to continue its success.  Other investments  With the company back in the black, Abram began to diversify his interests, including the St. Joseph & Denver Railroad, and various banks, insurance companies and other firms. In 1868, Abram co-founded Leech, Nave & Company in Kansas City, which later became a Nave & McCord branch office. In 1872, he co-founded the wholesale grocery house Nave, Goddard & Company in St. Louis. Later this store also became part of the Nave & McCord chain. Abram remained in St. Louis for 10 years overseeing the company before returning to St. Joseph. He also became a partner with James and others in the Smith-McCord Dry Goods Company in Pueblo, Colo., and a stockholder in the Henry Krug Packing Company in St. Joseph. The C.D. Smith & Company was founded in St. Joseph in 1859 with Abram and James as co-partners with Dudley M. Steele and Charles Daniel Smith, the latter of which was the company's manager. The company was originally a grocery wholesale business, but later became a drug store in 1886. Amazingly, the company remained in the Smith family for 133 years until it was bought by company employees in 1992. C.D. Smith Healthcare was acquired by AmeriSource Health Corporation in 1999. In 1879, a new Omaha branch of the mercantile company was opened under the name Nave, McCord & Brady. John Speer Brady moved to St. Joseph, Mo., in 1866 and got a job soon after at Nave, McCord & Company. After 13 years of service, he opened the Omaha branch and managed it. Abram eventually sold his interest in the branch and it was renamed the McCord-Brady Company. The building still stands and became Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in 1995. Another McCord-Brady office was later opened in Cheyenne, Wyoming, from 1915-32. More than 10 years younger than Abram, James McCord continued to branch out on his own with various mercantile and grocery businesses in Fort Worth, Texas; Oklahoma City; Kansas City, Mo.; Topeka, Kansas; and Hutchinson, Kansas; as well as a real estate firm in St. Joseph. Abram's wife Lucy died November 9, 1853, in Savannah. He married his second wife, Mary Blewett, in 1875. They ended up in a bitter divorce. Abram married a third time to Augusta Bagwell on Feb. 25, 1885. He had no children from either of these latter marriages.  Incorporation  Nave, McCord & Company was incorporated and re-christened as the Nave & McCord Mercantile Company in 1880. Also in 1880, property was secured for a new building in St. Joseph on South Third Street near the lines of the Missouri Pacific and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railroads. Disaster struck again when a handcart loaded with nails crashed into the supporting timbers and set fire to the uncompleted edifice by crashing into an area in which matches were stored. The new five- story, brick building was finally completed in 1882. That same year, a new branch office was opened in Atchison, Kansas. Cattle Company The Nave- McCord Cattle Company was formed in 1881 in Texas with an initial investment of 1,500 cattle and the purchase of the range rights on the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River at the mouth of Spring Creek in Garza County, Texas. The company created the Square and Compass Ranch after purchasing in Garza County. About half of the ranch land was on the Llano Estacado, which was high and level and good summer pasture, and the rest was in the broken land, which made excellent winter pasture. The herd was gradually increased through additional purchases to 15,000 head. The Square and Compass name and brand were reportedly patterned after the emblem of the Masons, of which Abram was a member. Fenced in 1884, the ranch was operated at a modest profit despite blizzards and drought in 1886. The ranch and cattle were sold in 1901 to John B. Slaughter, who renamed it the U Lazy S Ranch. The sale included of land at $1.60 an acre and 5,000 cattle.  Dissolution  Abram Nave died June 23, 1898, in St. Joseph,\\"Abraham Nave is Dead,\\" Kansas City Journal, page 2, June 24, 1898 and James McCord died September 24, 1903 in the same city. By then, the sons of both men had become involved in Nave & McCord. In 1929, Nave- McCord was sold to Western Grocer Company, of Marshalltown, Iowa.\\"Wholesale Concern Sold,\\" Monitor-Index and Democrat, page 10, Moberly, Missouri, Nov.25, 1929. Today several of the company's former buildings still stand, including those Atchison, Kan., and Omaha, Neb. In November 2016, a fire started and completely destroyed the five-story brick building in St Joseph, Mo. The 136-year-old building was demolished soon thereafter.  References  * Stevens, Walter.

However, the difficulty of Stok Kangri is often underestimated and the need to acclimatise before and during the ascent makes Stok Kangri an enduring challenge. In late July and August, all but the top of the peak may be snow-free. The elevation data was verified by GPS readings from 11 satellites at the Summit during a late July 2007 joint Nepalese-US expedition which encountered snow cover for 85% of the final four- hour, four km, 900 metre climb. Another GPS reading provided a 6136-meter elevation. The shortest route to the peak is along the Stok valley, following the Stok Chu to Stok village. This valley's grazing landscape, especially near the village, was devastated by the 2010 Ladakh floods, the most severe in decades. In December 2019, the All Ladakh Tour Operators Association announced that Stok Kangri is closed for trekking and climbing from 2020 to 2023, due to over-tourism. The interval is meant give the region a chance to recuperate.  Ascent  The peak is considered non-technical during July‚ÄìAugust, but becomes quite technical during the height of winter. Even in summer, novices should be well prepared, with appropriate physical fitness and equipment. The climb is exhausting and requires a good amount of stamina, both physically and mentally. The First official winter ascent was made by a British team in March 2002, Led by Ross Cooper, with Chris Hall, Paul Janlid, Mykl White and Caroline Williams. At the age of 20 years, Ross Cooper was the youngest expedition leader recorded by the IMF. It can take anything from two to five days to reach base camp () from the village of Stok, depending on acclimatisation schedules and fitness levels. The summit day lasts 8‚Äì14 hours, ascending over from Stok Kangri's base camp to its summit.

Lefebvre and others, \\"Voyage en Abyssinie\\" (Paris 1845‚Äì49) The military history of Ethiopia dates back to the foundation of early Ethiopian Kingdoms in 980 BC. Ethiopia has been involved many of the major conflicts in the horn of Africa, and was one of the few native African nations which remained independent during the Scramble for Africa, managing to create a modern army. 19th and 20th century Ethiopian Military history is characterized by conflicts with the Dervish State, Mahdist Sudan, Egypt, and Italy (which successfully annexed Ethiopia to Italian East Africa, until its liberation during WWII), and later by a civil war.  First Italo‚ÄìAbyssinian War (1895-1896) From 1895 to 1896, the First Italian-Abyssinian War was fought between the Kingdom of Italy and the Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia). Unlike most of Africa, Ethiopia was able to avoid being conquered by the European powers. In 1895, Italian armed forces invaded Ethiopia from Eritrea. But, because Ethiopia had established a single and incorporated army and broke ethnic barriers to unite, the Italian regular forces were decisively defeated within a year at the Battle of Adwa. Special role for this purpose was played by the Russian military advisers and volunteers of Menylik's army (for example Leonid Artamonov).Russian Mission to Abyssinia.Who Was Count Abai?. Leonid Artamonov, a Russian general, geographer and traveler, military adviser of Menelik II, as one of Russian officers of volunteers attached to the forces of Ras Tessema (wrote: Through Ethiopia to the White Nile).  Boundary confrontation against British Colonists (1896-1899)  After the successful colonial subjugation of the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, the British started to apply pressure against Ethiopia, which subsided somewhat during The Second Boer War 1899‚Äì1902. The Ethiopian military gained valuable experience by dealing with British colonial forces (both military and not) in the course of trying to establish a well defined border. The fact that the Ethiopian military (and state) was organized enough to resist and the fact that it had diplomatic relations with a number of European states from which it could draw on for diplomatic support and arms sales gave pause to the surrounding European powers. Alexander Bulatovich (one of the Russian military advisers and participant of expedition of legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis) wrote of the Ethiopian military- \\"Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is the most usual business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to spare his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine. You see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle. Despite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of whom there is no shortage.\\" Russia allowed a number of Ethiopians to attend several Russian military cadet schools. From 1901-1913, approximately 40 Ethiopian officers attended military training in Russia. Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam, the future author of Ethiopia's constitution, was among those that attended. In accordance with the order of emperor of Ethiopia, Nikolay Leontiev organized the first battalion of the regular Ethiopian army. It was presented to Menelik II, in February, 1899. This battalion formed the cadre around which the army was organized. The company of volunteers was then organised from the former Senegal shooters (disappointed or unreliable for colonial authorities), which he chose and invited from Western Africa. They were trained by Russian and French officers. The first Ethiopian military orchestra was organized at the same time. Count Leontiev is spy or adventurer... Nikolay Stepanovich Leontiev Second Italo- Abyssinian War On October 3, 1935, Fascist Italy invaded the Ethiopian Empire from Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. The Ethiopians used prohibited dumdum bullets and mutilated captured soldiers, while the Italians used chemical weaponry in a number of battles. The Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Spanish Civil War, and the Mukden Incident are often seen as precursors to World War II, and a demonstration of the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations. In 1941, after years of occupation, Emperor Haile Selassie I returned to what was now called Italian East Africa. With the help of the British, the Emperor led an uprising to drive the Italian Army from his country after a guerrilla war.  World War II  An American propaganda poster during the Second World War depicting an Ethiopian army bugler. During World War II, Ethiopia was under Italian occupation and part of the colony Italian East Africa. During the East African Campaign, with the help of British forces, Emperor Haile Selassie joined the resistance groups against the Italian Army. After some initial Italian offensive actions in 1940 (conquest of Kassala in Sudan and British Somalia), British and Commonwealth forces launched attacks from the Sudan and from Kenya. On 5 May 1941, the Emperor re-entered Addis Ababa. By the end of November, organized Italian resistance in East Africa ended with the fall of Gondar. However Italians maintained a guerrilla war, mainly in northern Ethiopia, until September 1943.  Korean War  Ethiopia sent 1,271‚Äì3,518 troops as part of the United Nation Forces to aid South Korea. The troops were known as the Kagnew Battalion under the command of General Mulugueta Bulli. It was attached to the American 7th Infantry Division, and fought in a number of engagements including the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. 121 were killed and 536 wounded during the Korean War.  Derg Rule  In 1974, a military coup overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and declared Ethiopia a republic. Between 1974 and 1984, a communist military junta called Derg ruled.  Ogaden War  Somalia invaded the Ogaden region and starting the Ogaden War. Fighting erupted as Somalia attempted a temporary shift in the regional balance of power in their favour by occupying the Ogaden region. The Soviet Union switched from supplying Somalia to supporting Ethiopia, which had previously been backed by the United States. The war ended when Somali forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. Ethiopia was able to defeat the Somali forces with the aid of the USSR, Cuba, and South Yemen. This was the first conflict in which the Mi-24 was used.  Civil War  A T-55 main battle tank guards an intersection following seizure of government control by rebel factions. The Ethiopian Civil War was a 17-year conflict between the Derg government backed by the USSR against anti-communist rebels backed by the United States. The conflict ended in 1991 with the Derg government defeated and out of power along with Eritrea gaining independence. The Eritrean insurgence that began in 1961 was helped by a nationwide Ethiopian guerrilla campaign of OLF, TPLF and ONLF against the Ethiopian Derg government. At the end of the Civil war, with the Eritrean and Ethiopian victory over the Derg government, Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1991 following a referendum.  Eritrean-Ethiopian War  The Eritrean-Ethiopian War was a border clash that took place from May 1998 to June 2000. Fighting escalated to artillery and tank fire leading to four weeks of intense fighting. Ground troops fought on three fronts. Eritrea claims Ethiopia launched air strikes against Eritrea's capital Asmara while Ethiopia accused Eritrea of striking first. The fighting led to massive internal displacement in both countries as civilians fled the war zone. The conflict ended in stalemate and deployment of UNMEE.  Somalia  In 2006, Ethiopia deployed troops to aid the TFG in the ongoing Somali Civil War. ENDF deployed troops in the northern region to aid the TFG and in the southern region with support from the United States Fifth Fleet. By January 2007 Ethiopian forces were about 200,000 troops. On November 2008 Ethiopia announced that they would be removing their troops, and all Ethiopian forces had left the country by January 15, 2009.

Clifford began his legal career in 1913 after studying law at the University of Michigan. He was an active trial lawyer, specializing in cases regarding search and seizure and Prohibition. He once served as assistant Attorney General of Wisconsin where he became well-known for prosecuting corruption cases. Politically, Clifford was a leader in the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and was once a Wisconsin Democratic nominee for Congress in 1934. In addition to his work in law and politics, he also served as an executive officer and team lawyer for the Green Bay Packers. Clifford helped the organization avoid bankruptcy, reincorporated the team under a new ownership model, and helped prevent the team from moving away from Green Bay, Wisconsin. He is one of The Hungry Five, a group of businessman who were instrumental in the early development of the Packers. Clifford died on February 24, 1952 at the age of 62. In recognition of his contributions, he was elected to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1991. Early life Gerald Francis Clifford was born in Chilton, Wisconsin on June 19, 1889, but grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. During his childhood, Clifford's father Jerry served as the mayor of Iron Mountain, Michigan for period of time. The family lived in Escanaba, Michigan during Clifford's teenage years, where he would attend Escanaba High School. After graduation, he traveled across Europe for 18 months while providing a written account of his travels for the local newspaper. Back in America, Clifford attended the University of Michigan and received a law degree in 1912. Legal and political career Clifford began his legal practice in 1913 with Patrick Martin, who was the father of John E. Martin, the future Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice. He would remain associated with the Martin law firm for the rest of his career, serving as a senior partner at the time of his death. Clifford ran for public office in 1916, losing an election to become the Wisconsin Attorney General. In 1923, he was appointed as a Brown County, Wisconsin assistant district attorney and in 1924 was named assistant Attorney General of Wisconsin. He became a well-known trial lawyer who specialized in Prohibition cases and search and seizure law. He also tried many corrupt practices cases during his time as a prosecutor. He handled 26 murder cases as a defense attorney; none of his clients were found guilty of the original charge. Clifford was a leader of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and a strong supporter of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1932 until his death. He was the chairman of the Wisconsin 8th District Democratic organizing committee and was part of various campaign committees. In 1934, he ran for public office a second time, losing a Congressional election. Prior to his death, he was mentioned as a possible appointee for a federal judgeship. Green Bay Packers Clifford became acquainted with the Green Bay Packers in the early 1920s. He was one of the local Green Bay, Wisconsin businessmen that Andrew B. Turnbull contacted to help raise money to keep the Packers afloat financially. Around 1929, Clifford began his first official role with the team when he replaced Ray Evrard as the team lawyer. His contributions over the next 20 years were so significant that he became recognized as one of The Hungry Five, a group of Green Bay businessmen who helped guide the early development of the Packers. He would go on to serve on the Packers board of directors from 1929 to 1950 and the executive committee from 1930 to 1950. From 1930 to 1933, he was elected vice president, serving under president Lee Joannes. He was also in charge of the Packers season-ticket drives for areas outside of the Green Bay metropolitan area. As the Packers attorney from 1929 to 1950, he defended the Packers in various lawsuits, including a case in 1933 where a fan fell from the stands. The resulting settlement from the lawsuit forced the Packers into receivership during the early 1930s. He then helped draft and sign the Articles of Incorporation after the franchise was reorganized in 1935 as the Green Bay Packers, Inc. The reorganization and resulting stock sales brought the Packers back from financial difficulties. In 1949 and 1950, he and former Packers president and team physician W. Webber Kelly successfully saved the non-profit status of the Packers organization in a power struggle with head coach Curly Lambeau. Even though they succeeded in maintaining the ownership structure and preventing the Packers from moving to a different city, both men resigned from the board of directors. Webber left in 1949 and Clifford resigned all his positions in 1950. Clifford was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1991 in recognition for his contributions as an executive for the team during its early years. Personal life Clifford was married to Mae Heney and had two daughters. His hobbies included hunting, fishing, and gardening. He died from influenza, which was made worse by a heart condition, on February 24, 1952, at the age of 62.

He kept an office at Grand Central Terminal in New York City, which was later converted into a bar called the Campbell Apartment, a popular gathering spot for commuters and others after work. Biography Campbell was the son of John H. Campbell, the treasurer of Credit Clearing House, a credit-reference firm specializing in the garment industry. The younger Campbell had two sisters and an older brother. The family lived on Cumberland Street, in the affluent Brooklyn neighborhood known as The Hill, now called Fort Greene. Having never attended college, Campbell started work at 18 at his father‚Äôs firm, where he became a senior executive at 25 and later president and chairman. In 1941, Credit Clearing House merged with Dun & Bradstreet. He married the former Rosalind D. Casanave, nicknamed Princess, who was once listed in The New York Times as a \\"patroness\\" of a \\"Monte Carlo party and dance\\" at the Westchester Country Club. In 1920, at the age of 40, Campbell was appointed to the board of New York Central Railroad, where he crossed paths with William Kissam Vanderbilt II, the railroad scion whose office was in Grand Central Terminal. It is probable that Vanderbilt showed Campbell the space. Campbell became chairman of the board of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, keeping the position until he died in 1957. Office in Grand Central Like other successful tycoons of the day, Campbell demanded a grand office, one convenient to his clients and close to the railroad so he could commute first from a nearby 270 Park Avenue apartment, and later, from the Westchester Country Club to the north. To satisfy these needs, he leased of space from Grand Central Terminal. It was a single room long by wide with a ceiling and an enormous fireplace in which he kept a steel safe. In 1923, Campbell commissioned Augustus N. Allen, an architect known for designing estates on Long Island and townhouses in Manhattan, to build an office in the leased space in Grand Central. He transformed it into a 13th-century Florentine palace with a hand-painted plaster of Paris ceiling and leaded windows. He installed 19th-century Italian chairs and tables, an art collection worth more than $1 million, and a massive desk from which he conducted business. One of the most striking features was a Persian carpet that took up the entire floor and was said to have cost $300,000 at the time, or roughly $3.5 million today. Campbell added a piano and pipe organ, and at night turned his office into a reception hall, entertaining 50 or 60 friends who came to hear famous musicians play private recitals. He had a permanent butler named Stackhouse. After Campbell‚Äôs death in 1957, the rug and other furnishings disappeared from his office and the space eventually became a signalman‚Äôs office and later a closet at Grand Central, where the transit police stored guns and other equipment. It also became a small jail, in the area of the present-day bar. It was restored in 1999 and turned into a bar.

One proposal proceeded as far as the construction stage before being stopped. Background By 1952, nearly every main centre in New Zealand was served by a railway, the exceptions being Kaitaia, Queenstown and Taupo. Taupo is one of New Zealand's biggest forestry centres and is a very popular tourist destination. Proposed routes =North Island Main Trunk line= The first time consideration was made to link Taupo with a railway was in 1884 when routes for extending the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) railway south from Te Awamutu to Wellington were being explored and surveyed. One of the proposed routes was from just south of Te Awamutu following the course of the Puniu River inland through to Taupo, and onwards east to link at Hastings with the proposed Palmerston North - Gisborne Line. This route did not eventuate and the present route via Taumarunui was chosen. =Mokai Tramway= Taupo Totara Timber Company sawmill at Mokai Railway line of the Taupo Totara Timber Company showing \\"the corkscrew\\", with five different levels ALCO mallett steam locomotive No 7 In 1903 the Taupo Totara Timber Company (TTT Co) constructed the 82 km Mokai Tramway to link their milling centre at Mokai with the New Zealand Government Railways line (NZR) at Putaruru. The line was built over the former Lichfield Branch line, which was originally built by the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company to be part of the line to Rotorua. The TTT Co line then went onwards south of Lichfield through what are now Tokoroa and Kinleith and crossed the Waikato River at Ongaroto. In general the TTT Co line was constructed to a fairly high standard for a bush tramway, with 1 in 30 grades and 30 metre radius curves. This reflected the company's ultimate intention to sell the line to NZR. In 1911 the TTT Co put forward a proposal to extend their line from Mokai into Taupo township via Oruanui. The station, and terminus of the line, was to be on Spa Road where Taupo-Nui-a-Tia College now stands. This would have required another bridge across the Waikato River. The proposal was quickly endorsed and praised by many in Taupo, and to support the extension the Taupo District Railway League was formed with powers to support the scheme and ensure it succeeded. The TTT Co proposed running the railway as a private trust-owned company. However, considerable objection was made to this proposal by the people of Rotorua, in particular the Rotorua Chamber of Commerce. They believed that any railway to Taupo should be from the railhead at Rotorua, running south via Waiotapu. The Rotorua Chamber of Commerce lodged a complaint to Parliament regarding the proposal. The Taupo District Railway League consequently lodged a complaint to the Member of Parliament for the district, Mr MacDonald, protesting the opposition being made by the Rotorua Chamber of Commerce. As time passed the proposal for the TTT Co scheme was eventually shelved, largely due to the outbreak of World War I and due to the considerable objections being made by the Rotorua Chamber of Commerce. The line would have required considerable improvements to bring it up to NZR standard as it was only built to carry timber and it consequently had very tight curves, narrow cuttings and light rails. It was not a fast railway line at all and the passengers that the TTT Co trains carried were noted to be able to climb off the train and walk alongside the train as it slowly crawled along. The TTT Co line eventually closed on 26 October 1944. However the Government saw that the line had greater potential and in September 1946 acquired the first 29 km between Putaruru and Kinleith. This section of line opened again on 9 June 1947 under the control of the Public Works Department using steam locomotives purchased from the TTT Co. Around the same time plans were being made for a large pulp and paper mill to be constructed at Kinleith. The line with its sharp curves, steep grades and light rails, needed to be significantly upgraded to enable heavy traffic. Reconstruction of the line began in 1949, reducing grades from 1 in 44 to 1 in 70 and curves from 201 metre radius to 322 metre radius. The rebuilt line was handed over to NZR on 12 June 1950. Around this time there was a proposal to rebuild the line and extend it to Taupo. Nothing further was heard of this proposal after the 1949 election. This proposal has been brought up many times since. =1980 Kinleith-Taupo line= In 1980 NZR investigated four possible routes for an extension of the Kinleith Branch to Taupo. The principal route ran south from the railhead at Kinleith following a route similar to State Highway 1 through to Atiamuri, then followed the western side of the Waikato River through Ohakuri and Orakei Korako to Aratiatia, where the line would cross the river over the rapids, before descending in an arc like curve heading north, then south in the vicinity of View Road and Broadlands Road, to terminate at the Fletchers Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. =Rotorua-Taupo line= Proposals to link Taupo with Rotorua and the greater Bay of Plenty with a railway date back to 1911. It had long been intended that the Rotorua Branch would be extended into the Bay of Plenty to connect with the line being built from Gisborne. A railway into the Bay of Plenty would link Rotorua and surrounding regions to the Port of Tauranga. Rotorua interests at the time lobbied very hard to have a line built between Rotorua and the Bay of Plenty, claiming the considerable amounts of land which would be opened up and linked to the port, particularly if the line were to be extended to Taupo. When the TTT Co announced a proposal in 1911 to extend its line running from Putaruru to Mokai into Taupo, this caused much upset in Rotorua, as it weakened Rotorua's case to have a line built to link Rotorua with the Port of Tauranga. The Rotorua Chamber of Commence consequently voiced strong opposition to the TTT Co proposal, and said that \\"any railway connection to Taupo should be from the Government railway at Rotorua\\". The Government however was more focused on completing the East Coast Main Trunk Railway linking Tauranga and Gisborne, and would not consider linking Rotorua to the Bay of Plenty until that line was completed. The outbreak of World War I temporarily put a stop to the Rotorua proposal but once the war was over, enthusiasm for a line to link Rotorua and Taupo with the Port of Tauranga was renewed. In 1920 a Royal Commission was set up to investigate the viability of the government purchasing either the entire TTT Co or just the TTT Co tramway and options for building a railway into Taupo. The commission consisted of H.J.H. Blow, chief engineer of the Public Works Department, as chairman; Mr. F.W. Furkert, chief engineer of the TTT Co; Mr. H. Buxton of NZR; and Mr. G.H.M. McClure, Commissioner of Crown Lands for Wellington, with Mr. H.H. Sterling as secretary. In 1921 the commission brought forward a unanimous finding \\"There is urgent necessity in order to avoid great national waste, for an extension of the Rotorua Government Railway to Waiotapu with as little delay as possible\\". Despite this finding no further action was taken by the government. However the Rotorua Taupo Railway League, led by Edward Earle Vaile, continued to vigorously campaign for the Rotorua‚ÄìTaupo railway to be built. In May 1922 a Royal Commission was set up to investigate the construction and working of a Rotorua‚ÄìTaupo railway, with five members: H. Buxton, G. T. Murray, L.M. Ellis, J.D. Ritchie and H. Munro. Its terms of reference were to access anticipated traffic and profitability and assess the area's settlement potential and a possible route. A favourable report was returned by the commission; however despite this, no further action was taken by the government. '' In 1924 a line from Rotorua to Reporoa was authorised by Parliament in the Railways Authorisation Act, 1924 as the Rotorua-Taupo (Line): an extension of the authorised line from Rotorua southward to Reporoa. Length about 28 miles (45 km). However construction was not started as the Government's focus at the time was on completing the construction of the East Coast Main Trunk Line. Much lobbying continued by Rotorua interests and by the Rotorua Taupo Railway League, which consisted of settlers living between Taupo and Rotorua. By 1928 support for the Rotorua‚ÄìTaupo line was very strong. Cabinet approval In June 1928 the Coates government cabinet approved the construction of the Rotorua‚ÄìTaupo railway. The line was to be constructed initially as far as Waiotapu, and then onwards to Taupo via Reporoa. Work began almost immediately with teams of construction workers transferred from the extension of the East Coast Main Trunk from Taneatua to ≈åp≈çtiki, which had been stopped. An ex- railways employee doubted whether the new line would be economic. In Rotorua, it had been hoped that work on the line would go to Rotorua people, as unemployment was very high in the town. For approximately one year from the date of approval by cabinet, men worked on constructing embankments and cuttings along the proposed route a short distance out of Rotorua between Waipa and Waiotapu. However, in 1929, as a result of the depression and a downturn in economic activity, the Forbes government cabinet announced that work on the Rotorua‚ÄìTaupo railway would cease as soon as jobs could be found in other parts of the country for the men working on this scheme. This was a real blow to the supporters of the railway and did not help Rotorua at a time of high unemployment. There was much vocal opposition in Rotorua at the line being stopped and calls for the work to be resumed. The Rotorua Taupo Railway League produced a pamphlet titled \\"The truth about the Taupo Railway - the story of a great crime\\" arguing the need for and numerous benefits this line would bring, and the unjust stopping of the project by the government. The work did not resume and the formation and cuttings were abandoned. Some of this work can still be seen between Rotorua and Taupo along State Highway 5, on the western side of the road, a short distance out of Rotorua. From 1929 onwards there were various calls for the railway between Rotorua and Taupo to be restarted but nothing of any great significance occurred until 1968. =Paengaroa-Rotorua-Taupo line= In 1968 NZR announced a proposal to construct a new line to Rotorua from Paengaroa on the East Coast Main Trunk, with an extension to the Waipa State Mill. An extension to Taupo was also seen by NZR \\"as being very attractive\\". This proposal followed from the recommendations of a 1963 Commission of Inquiry report to investigate \\"Improved Access by Land to the Port of Tauranga and Bay of Plenty\\", which had recommended: * The construction of a deviation from Waharoa to Apata through the Kaimai Range, and the closure of the Paeroa to Apata section of the East Coast Main Trunk. * The construction of a Rotorua to Paengaroa deviation to eliminate the Mamaku Bank on the Rotorua Branch. * An extension of the Rotorua Branch to the Waipa State Mill. The proposal created much attention both in support and against the idea. NZR wanted a better link into the Rotorua region to tap into and serve the central North Island pine forests with the Port of Tauranga and a line with easier grades than the steep line over the Mamaku ranges. The route of the proposed new line and in particular, the proposed siting of new marshalling yards at Rotorua was the reason for much of the objections. NZR wanted to extend the existing Rotorua Branch line from the central city station, across Fenton Street to Ngapuna where they proposed having a large marshalling yard, along with a spur line running south to the Waipa State Mill. Many people in Rotorua objected to having a railway crossing Fenton Street and wanted the railway marshalling yards located at Waipa instead of Ngapuna. NZR objected to shifting the marshalling yards to Waipa, as it would significantly increase the cost of the project by around $6m. However an equally great number of people in Rotorua supported the railway proposal and consequently it became a hot political debate. By 1973 NZR started to back down on the proposal and stated that the scheme would only proceed if the people of Rotorua agreed upon where the marshalling yards would be located. The scheme fell through shortly after. =1980 Rotorua-Taupo line= In 1980 NZR carried out a number of investigations into possible rail routes to Taupo, one of which was a route between Tarukenga on the Rotorua Branch, via Paradise Valley and the western side of Pukehangi Road through to the Waipa State Mill, and then onwards south to the Fletchers Taupo Mill via the Reporoa dairy factory. The route proposed was considered an improvement on the original 1920s route and was said to address the contentious issues raised with the earlier route of the proposed Paengaroa-Rotorua line, such as the location of marshalling yards in Rotorua and avoiding having the line running through the urban area in Rotorua city. This new route however was still limited by the steep grades of the existing Rotorua Branch over the Mamaku ranges, to which it would connect to. A northern extension of the proposed new line from Tarukenga onwards around the northern side of Lake Rotorua to Paengaroa on the ECMT was said to address this if included, and would also provide a shorter and more direct link between Taupo and the Port of Tauranga. In 1989 the central city station and railway yard at Rotorua closed, and along with the last 2 km of the line were lifted and relocated to Koutu. =Kakahi- Pukawa line= A proposal to construct a railway between Kakahi on the North Island Main Trunk and Pukawa on the shores of Lake Taupo, near Tokaanu, was made by a group of three people - Te Heuheu Tukino, Paramount chief of the Ngati Tuwharetoa iwi (tribe); Lawrence Grace, who was closely related through marriage to the tribe; and Tudor Atkinson, the founder of the TTT Co. The three set up a company called the Tongariro Timber Company Limited with the intention to construct the railway and to have branch lines heading into the bush at various points along the route to harvest the native timber along the way. The railway was intended to be paid for using some of the large sums of money expected to be earned from the timber to be harvested. It was agreed that the land would remain in Maori ownership and that the Tongariro Timber Company Limited would operate the railway. Once the railway was built the company would carry freight other than timber, such as dressed flax and grain, and passengers at Government rates. The railway would connect with a ferry service on Lake Taupo. In January 1908 an Order in Council was made allowing the Maori owners to sell land for the construction of the railway. Work began immediately on surveying the proposed railway line. Tudor Atkinson tried locally to raise the necessary capital to build the railway. His efforts proved unsuccessful, and in 1916 he went to London where he formed a separate company to finance the railway. However World War I intervened and the company ended up being dissolved with all money being returned to the prospective shareholders. In 1913 the Egmont Box Company Limited arrived at Kakahi in search of white pine (Kahikatea) for constructing boxes for dairy products. The company found suitable quantities of white pine on land next to which the Tongariro Timber Company held cutting rights to. The company obtained the cutting rights to this land, however it was found that the Egmont Box Company would need to construct a light railway to haul the logs out on. With the Tongariro Timber Company already having plans to build such a railway, it was proposed that the railway be constructed jointly by the two companies. It was agreed that the Egmont Box Company would construct the railway as far as the land that they were to harvest logs from, and then the Tongariro Timber Company would construct the rest of the line to Pukawa. Work started immediately and soon various cuttings, bridging, and track had been laid. However, with World War I by now claiming many of the necessary fit and able men needed to do the job, work began to slow and it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain materials. In 1916 progress was further hindered with the New Zealand Government Railways (NZR) changing its mind on how the line was to connect with their line at Kakahi station. This meant that the Egmont Box Company would need to spend a very large amount of money to change the route to that now required to join up with the NZR line at Kakahi. This was money the company did not have and nor did the Tongariro Timber Company. Tudor Atkinson tried very hard to obtain the necessary capital but from this time onwards it was to be the end of the scheme as far as the Tongariro Timber Company and Egmont Box Company were concerned. Other parties tried to carry out and construct the railway, but all failed to do so with either not being able to obtain the necessary capital or the economic viability of the scheme prevented them making any progress. One group in the 1920s however did raise the necessary capital and gained the support from the Maori landowners but not the Government. Consequently, this lack of support from the Government was why their scheme did not eventuate. The forest between Kakahi and Lake Taupo remained standing until after World War II when it was felled. By then the railway proposal had given way to road transport. Today all that can be seen of this scheme is the rail formation and large cutting built from Kakahi to the Whakapapa River. =Murupara Branch line= Since 1980 there have been proposals to extend the Murupara Branch line to Taupo. The principal reason for extending this line has been to tap into the plantation pine forests in the central North Island and in particular those in the Taupo region. 1980 proposal In 1980 a report was produced by NZR on possible rail routes to Taupo, which included two possible routes from the railhead at Murupara. The principal route of the line was to be constructed from the railhead at Murupara by way of two possible routes to address the steep climb up onto the Kaingaroa plains, where it would cross towards the State Highway 5 Napier- Taupo Road, then sweep around the southern flank of Mt Tauhara in an arc like shape and then head north towards the Taupo industrial area before sweeping around in another arc in the Broadlands Road area and terminating at the Fletchers Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report also suggested possible extensions could be made from this proposed route to Napier, Waiouru and National Park. The route to Napier would run from Te Awa (near High Level Road) through to Waikoau (north of Napier) on the Palmerston North-Gisborne line. The routes to Waiouru and National Park would run from Waimihia on the State Highway 5 Napier-Taupo Road, south through to Rangipo, with the route to Waiouru following a similar route south to the State Highway 1 Desert Road, and the route to National Park running east from Rangipo following a similar route to State Highway 47 and 46 along the northern boarder of the Tongaririo National Park to join the NIMT just south of National Park station. 1983 proposal In 1983 a study by town and country planners of the Ministry of Works found that if a railway were to be constructed into the Taupo region, it would be very beneficial in transporting logs and sawn timber out of the region to the Pulp and Paper Mill at Kawerau and for export through the Port of Tauranga. It was also found that such a line would break even with revenue made from it covering the costs of constructing it. The line was to be constructed from the present railhead at Murupara, across the Kaingaroa plains where it would sweep around the southern flank of Mt Tauhara in an arc like shape and then head north towards the Taupo industrial area before sweeping around in another arc in the Broadlands Road area and terminating at the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. It was also suggested that there be a second stage to construct a line from the first stage line, near the State Highway 5 Napier-Taupo Road through to Rangipo, so as to tap into forests in the Turangi area. 1985 proposal In 1985 Deputy General Manager of the New Zealand Railways Corporation, Bob Henare, stated that a proposed extension of the Murupara Branch line to Taupo would be a \\"no frills\\" style of railway with sharper curves and steeper grades so as to keep costs down. The line was to be a forestry style railway similar to the Murupara Branch, with its key role being to transport timber. Predicted increases in the number of logging trucks on public roads would also become a major problem when logging commenced in the region. He also said that the line would need to be constructed quickly as the rapidly maturing forests would not wait while people argued over whether or not to build the line. It was also intended for the line to be electrified from Taupo through to Mt Maunganui, once men who were at the time working on the electrification of the North Island Main Trunk, could be transferred on completion of the project. The 1985 proposal did not eventuate following the large scale restructuring and downsizing of NZR in the mid 1980s, as part of the large scale economic reforms being undertaken the Fourth Labour Government at this time. Proposals to have the line extended to Taupo have been raised since that time, the last being in 1998. 1998 proposal In 1998 the findings of a study by consultants Woodward-Clyde for Environment Bay of Plenty, Environment Waikato, the Taupo District Council and Tranz Rail Limited were published to evaluate the various proposals to deal with transporting forestry products out of the Taupo region. The report stated that railheads could be accessed at Waiouru, National Park, Kinleith, and Murupara. The report said that it would be unlikely that rail connections would be made at National Park or Waiouru as the distance to forestry ports and processing plants would increase. A connection from Kinleith was a possibility but it would need to traverse difficult terrain and two crossings of the Waikato River may be needed. The report recommended an extension of the Murupara Branch line as being the best rail option. The route recommended was similar to the 1985 proposal. The line would have traveled across the Kaingaroa Plains and followed the route more or less presently taken by the private forestry road, High Level Road. Stage one of the proposal would terminate at the junction between the two private forestry roads, High Level Road and the Off- Highway road leading from the Taupo Mill, near the State Highway 5 Napier- Taupo road. A recommendation was made that a log-processing yard be built at the junction of these two roads in conjunction with the rail line extension from Murupara. The second stage of the proposal was to extend the line into the Taupo industrial area. The line would extend from the proposed log- processing yard around the southern flank of Mount Tauhara and head north towards Broadlands Road before completing a horseshoe like curve south into the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report said the line would be used for transporting sawn timber from the processing yard to the mill on Centennial Drive. Forest industry people did not express an interest in this option, as they did not believe it would bring any new opportunities to them. The report concluded in respect to the rail options that Tranz Rail (now KiwiRail) and Fletcher Forests (now Tenon) would need to check the opportunities in extending a line south from the Murupara railhead. A roading option was consequently chosen and the rail proposal did not eventuate. The roading option involved a network of private forestry roads and did not use the proposed rail route. =Kinleith-Rotorua-Taupo line= In 2014 the New Zealand First political party included a proposal to investigate a Kinleith-Rotorua- Taupo line as part of its transport policy. The proposal consists of an extension of the Kinleith Branch line east across to Waipa mill at Rotorua, before heading south to Taupo via Reporoa and Broadlands, terminating at the Taupo mill.

It was published in 2004 by HarperCollins Publishers under their Eos Books imprint.Paperback edition, 2005, Eos Books. It is the seventh novel in Gardner's \\"League of Peoples\\" series. Like the six preceding novels, Radiant is set in the middle of the 25th century; like most of them, it takes place in outer space and on alien planets, and features the continuing character Festina Ramos.The exceptions to the latter are Commitment Hour and Trapped, which are set on Earth, or in Gardner's terms \\"Old Earth\\", and do not feature the Ramos character. Backstory In keeping with the series as a whole, Radiant shares the same backstory and conceptual background as the earlier books. Humanity has moved into the galaxy: based on a terraformed and bio- engineered New Earth, a human society called the Technocracy has developed an advanced, multi-planet, space-travelling society. The Technocracy explores space and colonizes new planets through its navy-like Outward Fleet and its Explorer Corps. Youn Suu, the novel's protagonist and first-person narrator, is a member of that Corps, as are the majority of the protagonists in Gardner's series. The Technocracy exists under the aegis of the League of Peoples, an umbrella organization of highly advanced alien beings that enforces a galactic peace and controls fatal violence against sentient beings in interstellar space. In Radiant, Gardner develops hints in the earlier books of a more complex picture of the human future. Specifically, he delineates an offshoot of Technocracy society that calls itself Unity. In the Technocracy, genetic modification of human beings is severely limited (though the limits are regularly violated on an individual and black market basis), while the Unity has embraced genetic modification as their way of life. The novel also employs alien species introduced in prior books: the Cashlings (from Ascending), the Greenstriders (from Expendable and Vigilant), the Fuentes (from Ascending), and most notably, from Hunted, the form of sentient red moss nicknamed \\"the Balrog\\" (an obvious and Gardner-acknowledged borrowing from J. R. R. Tolkien). In Hunted, a supporting character is infected with the red moss in a symbiotic relationship; in that novel, Festina Ramos describes the moss as \\"Grossly intelligent...marginally telepathic and telekinetic...possibly precognitive...\\" (Hunted, chapter 16; ellipses in the original). Experience shows that the moss is far more powerful and formidable than Festina then guessed (scratch the \\"marginally\\" and \\"possibly\\"). In Radiant, the protagonist Youn Suu is infested with the Balrog, with extreme consequences. Buddhism In Radiant, concepts from Buddhism play an important role: Youn Suu is a Buddhist from a planet settled by Buddhists; each chapter is prefaced by a Buddhist term and its definition. Gardner makes interesting connections between the traditional religion and one of the most basic preoccupations of his series, the idea of the evolution of biological life beyond the physical plane of existence. In Gardner's universe, alien species tend to go through an identifiable sequence of development--their \\"space-exploration phase, their bio-engineering phase, their evolution into immortal energy-beings phase...\\" (Vigilant, chapter 17; ellipsis in the original). The implication is that humanity can follow the same arc of development--an implication that is stronger in Radiant than in any of its predecessors. The traditional Buddhist concept of individual spiritual development till the attainment of Nirvana dovetails neatly with this fictional idea. In the Author's Note that prefaces Radiant, Gardner specifies that he is not \\"preaching\\" Buddhism, but rather employing the religion to give his character a \\"multiplicity\\" of viewpoints on their world and their experience. Through much of the novel, the reader has varied access to the views of three different characters--Youn Suu, Festina Ramos, and a character known only by the nickname Tut, the three Explorers who do the novel's exploring. Ramos is a pragmatic realist, while Tut is a crazy person with a gold-plated face and penis. If Youn Suu embodies an Eastern take on the story's events, Ramos and Tut can be taken to represent the polar opposites of the Western mind. Some would use the terms left-brain (Ramos) and right-brain (Tut), while a classicist might prefer Apollonian versus Dionysian; there are many other pairs of terms that have been proposed for the same basic concepts.Intellect/intuition, analytic/holistic, convergent/divergent, abstract/concrete, focal/diffuse, objective/subjective, etc. See: David Loye, The Sphinx and the Rainbow, Boulder, CO, Shambhala, 1983; especially p. 32. All three of these orientations are needed for the story's successful conclusion. Plot summary At the start of the story, Youn Suu is a rookie Explorer on her first assignment in interstellar space. Like most Explorers, she suffers from a significant physical deformity--in her case, a facial blemish that has been left untreated to \\"qualify\\" her for the Explorer Corps. Her first assignment, with her partner Tut, is to investigate a sudden infestation of the Balrog in a domed city on the home world of the Cashlings. While there, she is herself infested by the red moss. At the same time, Youn Suu and Tut encounter Admiral Festina Ramos, present on a mission of her own. Aboard an Outward fleet starship, Youn Suu is monitored medically, though there is no cure for her condition and no real treatment. The Balrog, far more than a parasite, is a hive mind well above the human level of development, so that killing it would violate the central precept of the League of Peoples. As its symbiotic relationship with its human host develops, the Balrog comes to share the mental functioning of its host, and prolongs the host's life while consuming her body--\\"her\\" because the only prior human host was also female (and also a Buddhist). Youn Suu is also exposed to potential exploitation, by people who want to use the Balrog's special abilities for their own purposes. Meanwhile, Ramos and the other explorers are called to an emergency rescue on a planet called Muta, where Unity survey teams have suddenly disappeared, with barely a peep of a distress signal. The planet Muta, temperate and Earth-like, is to outward appearances almost ideal for colonization; yet colonizing efforts by the Unity, and the Greenstriders, and perhaps others, have mysteriously failed. The three Explorers land on the planet; even with the most elaborate precautions they fall prey to its peculiar circumstances, and find themselves stranded and contaminated with a microbe that threatens to destroy their bodies. Investigating their predicament, they learn that the entire planet was once a global research station for the Fuentes, a species that discovered a way to transcend the physical body and transform itself into energy-based or consciousness-based entities. The research done by the Fuentes on Muta 6500 years earlier had been in pursuit of that goal--but had gone horribly wrong, dooming Fuentes and Greenstrider and Unity individuals to a disembodied but tortuous existence. While being hunted by raptor-like reptiles, the three Explorers must find a way to repair alien technology to reverse the damage, before their own bodies collapse.

Despite being one of a short group of non- championship games still detailed in the Official Rules and Records Book of the Billiard Congress of America, as of 2006, bottle pool was known only to be the billiard sport of general choice at a few New York City social clubs such as the two mentioned previously. A veteran member of both those clubs opined in 2006 that there were then fewer than 1,000 dedicated bottle pool players nationwide.  General rules (Billiard Congress of America)  The initial set up for bottle pool = Set up = At the start of bottle pool, the shake bottle is placed inverted (neck down) on the at the geographic center of the of a pool table. The two object balls used are the 1 ball and the 2 ball. Viewed from the racker's vantage point, the 1 ball is to the on the immediately adjacent to the right corner pocket, and the 2 ball to the diamond on the foot rail immediately adjacent to the left corner pocket. The player breaking starts with from the (behind the ) and must contact either of the two object balls in order to complete a legal break. The object of the game is to score exactly 31 points before any opponents, with a draconian penalty for overshooting that benchmark. = Scoring = Points are scored in bottle pool in the following ways: # the 1 ball scores 1 point; # Pocketing the 2 ball scores 2 points; # the cue ball off both object balls scores 1 point; # Caroming the cue ball off one or both object balls and then into the bottle knocking it onto its side scores 5 points; # Caroming the cue ball off one or both object balls and then into the bottle knocking onto its base results in an automatic win. All of the above scoring possibilities can be combined, meaning the maximum number of points available on a single stroke is nine, accomplished by caroming into and pocketing both object balls combined with knocking over the bottle with the cue ball. The winning shot in the game (other than one which rights the shake bottle) must bring a player's score to exactly 31. If a player overshoots that benchmark, known as a \\"burst\\" in the game's terminology, the number of points 31 is overshot by becomes the player's new score. This means, for example, that if a player has 30 points and then scores 5 points (instead of the requisite 1 point) by caroming the cue ball off an object ball and into the bottle knocking it on its side, the player's score resets to 4 points. When a player reaches exactly 31 points, he must announce this feat to all participants before the next player shoots a shot in order to be victorious. If this is not done, the player may not again invoke his winning score until his turn comes up again in rotation. If another player in the interim successfully scores exactly 31, and properly announces it, that player wins the game. = Illegal shots and fouls = Any legally made scoring shot entitles a player to continue shooting. The penalty for a in the game is a loss of turn, any point scoring acts made on the same stroke are not counted, and 1 point is deducted from the player's total score. The incoming player after a foul accepts the table in position except if the cue ball is jumped off the table or a occurs, in which case the incoming player has from the . Three consecutive fouls in bottle pool results in a loss of game. In addition to standard fouls defined in the General Rules for Pocket Billiards, such as scratches, , and others, the following are specifically defined fouls peculiar to bottle pool: the cue ball fails to touch an object ball; the cue ball touches the bottle before contacting an object ball; the bottle is knocked over by an object ball; and an object ball is pocketed on the same stroke as an illegal shot. Illegal shots which are not fouls unless a ball is pocketed on the same stroke (thus resulting in a loss of turn, no score, but not a loss of points), include: causing an to touch the bottle at all before the cue ball touches it (without knocking it over); and causing the bottle to go into a pocket or off the table as a result of action by the cue ball, after it has caromed off an object ball. Montage showing how the is righted upside down as close as possible to its knocked over resting position, as judged by the mouth of the bottle. = Bottle and ball spotting rules = Whenever the shake bottle is knocked over it is immediately stood up open end down as close as possible to the position on the table at which it came to rest after being upset, as judged from the mouth of the bottle. When the shake bottle is knocked into a pocket, off the table, or where the open end of the bottle intrudes over a pocket opening such that it is impossible to replace it to its upset resting position, the shake bottle is replaced to the table's center spot. If the center spot is occupied by any ball, then it is placed on the . If both the center and head spots are occupied, then it is placed on the . If none of the listed spots are available then it remains off the table until such time as the center spot becomes unobstructed. As in the games of snooker, English billiards, cowboy pool and others, pocketed balls are immediately respotted to their starting position. Where the second object ball, the cue ball or the bottle makes the ball there impossible, it is spotted to the center spot. If the center spot is occupied, the ball is spotted to the head spot. Where both object balls have been on a shot, they are spotted with the same dictates for just one ball, first spotting the 1 ball, followed by the 2 ball. Thus, if the starting positions for the two object balls are each occupied, respectively by the cue ball and shake bottle, the 1 ball would be placed on the center spot and the 2 ball on the head spot.  Variations  The game is sometimes played with the larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls. Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted most of their time to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets. The rules promulgated by the Manhattan Athletic Club in the 1890s diverge in a number of ways from the modern rules published by the BCA (though they do use the numbered 1 and 2 balls, rather than carom billiards balls). Those provide that when a player bursts, his score is set to zero rather than to the number of points 31 is overshot; pocketed object balls are replaced on the \\"red-ball spot\\" (the foot spot), or if occupied, frozen to the foot rail in the original position of the 1 ball and if occupied, of the 2 ball; and no foul rules whatever are preferred. One further variation places a 6-sided die (although other sided die could also be used) on top of the bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.

The mission of CAMP is to support and produce socially engaged and aesthetically innovative public art, locally and globally as a grassroots artist-run organization. CAMP is a community, a public space, and an organizing force that uses public art (murals, street art, performance art, dance, poster projects, literary events) as a means for supporting social, economic, racial, and environmental justice messaging and storytelling. The project is currently co-directed by Megan Wilson and Christopher Statton with a Board of Directors that includes Wilson, Statton, Shaghayegh Cyrous, Keyvan Shovir, Ivy McClelland, Kyoko Sato, Fara Akrami, and Chris Gazaleh. Clarion Alley runs one block (560 ft long and 15 ft. wide) in San Francisco's inner Mission District between 17th and 18th streets and Mission and Valencia streets.https://clarionalleymuralproject.org/ CAMP has become a highly-sought destination for tourists and locals with over 200,000 visitors each year. Additionally, CAMP has been highlighted in numerous books, including Hollow City by Rebecca Solnit, Staying with the Trouble by Donna J. Haraway, Street Messages by Nicholas Ganz, and Agency (novel) by William Gibson, as well in publications such as Forbes, The Guardian, The New York Times , and CNN. CAMP is also featured in: three Netflix series - Sense8, Girlboss; and Tales of the City (2019 miniseries); the film An Examined Life, directed by Astra Taylor; and the music video Storm by Lenny Kravitz.https://clarionalleymuralproject.org/ Origins CAMP was formed in October 1992 by a volunteer collective of six residents of the North Mission District, San Francisco: Aaron Noble, Michael O'Connor, Sebastiana Pastor, Rigo 92, Mary Gail Snyder, and Aracely Soriano. Inspired by Balmy Alley and other murals and muralists of San Francisco's Mission District, CAMP came together to initiate a mural project on Clarion Alley. At the time, two of the founders were living on the alley, while another had helped found the Balmy Alley project. While Balmy Alley focused on the theme of Central American struggle, the stated goals of CAMP were social inclusiveness and aesthetic variety. CAMP went on to organize projects off site at the ILWU Local 6 SF headquarters (1995), the Redstone Building (1997), Yogyakarta Indonesia (2003, 2018), and the Roxie Theater (2012), as well as gallery installations at San Francisco Art Institute, New Langton Arts, and Intersection for the Arts.

It is located north of Melbourne between the townships of Seymour and Nagambie in the Nagambie Lakes a sub region of Goulburn Valley Wine Region. It was established in 1860,Victoria Winery Tours and is the oldest family-owned winery and vineyard in Victoria. The winery is part of Australia's First Families of Wine, a prominent Australian wine alliance.Simon Evans, The Australian Financial Review, Tuesday 18 August 2009, Page 61Chris Snow, Decanter Magazine, 17 August 2009, Top Australian wineries team up to push super-premium wines  History  In 1856, Hugh Glass became the owner of the Goulburn River property that included the future Tahbilk. Rushworth storekeeper Ludovic Marie convinced Glass the land was suitable for viticulture and took over of the property for a proposed vineyard and winery. Marie engaged his friend Richard Henry Horne, who had invested in blocks of land at nearby Murchison on the Goulburn River. Horne was eager to \\"promote any venture which might bring prosperity to the district\\" and agreed to participate in the winery plan. The two set up a public company, the Goulburn Vineyard Proprietary, with Marie as manager and Horne as honorary secretary. In 1859, the company advertised for capital of ¬£30,000 in ¬£5 shares. Its provisional committee comprised Horne, J.G. Dougharty of Melbourne and N.R.D. Bond and A. Sinclair of Murchison. The advertisement said: > The position of the land, the quality of the soil, the proximity of the > water, make the property the most desirable spot which could be selected for > vine growing. The quantity of grapes produced by the few stocks of vine in > the garden and at the house, is an indubitable proof of the capabilities of > the ground. Tahbilk Tower In August 1860, the company was called Tahbilk Vineyard Proprietary, with Ludovic Marie as Principal Vigneron and Charles Ebden and James Blackwood as trustees. The provisional directory, in addition to Horne and Bond, comprised Richard Eades, John Pinney Bear, David Wilkie, George Holmes, Hugh Glass, Samuel Rentsch, G.S. Evans, J.W. Mackenna, J.H. Brooke and Donald Kennedy. They included three Members of the Legislative Assembly, two Members of the Legislative Council, two Justices of the Peace, the Swiss Consul, the Argentinian Consul-General and the Mayor of Melbourne. Marie addressed a dinner of vineyard workers in 1861; he said, \\"the money for all these extensive operations which were being carried on was found almost solely by three gentlemen... Messrs. Bear, Glass and Holmes\\". In May 1860, one the company's founders, Sinclair, was found dead in Brighton from an overdose of morphine administered by persons unknown, with \\"a list of shareholders in the Goulburn Vineyard Company ... found sewn up in the pocket\\" of his coat. One of the last men to see Sinclair alive was Ludovic Marie, who was declared insolvent in August 1861. The venture did not compensate Horne for the money he had lost in the early public float, and he returned to England but later said he was \\"the father of the Australian wine industry\\". When Marie left the company, John Pinney Bear assumed control and progressively bought out the other shareholders; by 1876 he was sole owner. By that year, Tahblik's annual vintage output was around and was winning national and international awards. Bear employed Fran√ßois De Coueslant as manager in 1877, who is credited with planting the estates' mulberry trees and building the winery tower. A year later The Argus reported that Tahbilk had received a wine order from Queen Victoria. In 1889 Bear, a former Member of the Victorian Legislative Council, died at Tahbilk. De Coueslant had left in 1886, and Chateau Tahbilk as it was known went into decline, with the vineyard shrinking to by 1925. It was purchased by the Purbrick family in 1931 and remains in their ownership. Until 2000, the winery was known as Chateau Tahbilk. The original cellars built in the 1860s and 1870s are still in use. These and the vineyard's buildings are classified by the National Trust of Australia.National Trust of Australia =Claims= Tahbilk, founded in 1860, claims to be the oldest family-owned winery in Victoria. Other wineries predate Tahbilk's origins, for example Chambers Rosewood Winery and Gehrig Estate Wines in Rutherglen founded in 1858, and Morris Wines, also in Rutherglen, was founded in 1859.News & Information for the Australian Wine Industry However, none of these wineries have had the continuous family ownership of Tahbilk. Tahbilk claims to have the largest single holding of Marsanne grapevines in the world.Marsanne at Tahbilk The first vines were cuttings made in the 1860s from the St Huberts Winery in the Yarra Valley. Tahbilk's current plantings of Marsanne date from 1927. Etymology The name Tahbilk originates from the winery's location, which the local aboriginal people first referred to as \\"tabilk-tabilk\\", meaning \\"place of many waterholes\\".History of Tahbilk Originally spelled Tabilk, the 'h' was added later by the winery in hopes of improving business in Europe. Winery The winery specialises in the Rhone grape varietals of Marsanne, Viognier and Roussanne, and also produces Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Riesling, Semillon, Sauvignon blanc, Verdelho, Grenache and Mourvedre grapes. Some original pre-phylloxera Shiraz vines survive from 1860. Tahbilk is part of the Australian wine alliance Australia's First Families of Wine. First Families' chairman is the Tahbilk chief executive Alister Purbrick. The company also owns Dalfarras Wines, Tahbilk Wetlands Cafe, and Tahbilk Wetlands and Wild Life Reserve. Awards Tahbilk wines have won awards including the Diploma of Honour, the highest award obtainable at the Greater London Exhibition of 1899.Tahbilk awards Tahbilk was the National Winner in the Parks, Gardens and the Environment Category of the Best of Wine Tourism Awards 2007.Best of Wine Tourism  Wetlands and wildlife reserve  With the construction of the Goulburn Weir in 1889, the various stages of Sugar Loaf Dam in 1915, and Lake Eildon, completed in 1956, the historical flow regime of the Goulburn river was changed from one of high flows in winter to one of a permanently flowing summer irrigation stream. Previously the river and its associated billabongs had periodically dried back into a series of water holes. The local indigenous people named this area tabilk tabilk, or the place of many water holes, thus giving the property its name. The present Tahbilk wetlands area was created by the raising of the water level at the time that the Goulburn Weir was built. The Tahbilk wetlands are an open ended, self flushing wetlands joined to the Goulburn. Their warm, slow moving, water has become a safe haven for indigenous flora and fauna, including at least two threatened or endangered species. The native catfish Tandanus tandanus, which is declining throughout the Murray Darling Basin, is now breeding in the wetlands, and the Water Shield Lily Brasenia schreberi is also thriving there.

The term refers to the longitudinal profile of a glaciated valley that has several consecutive hanging valleys. Formation There are a few different ways cyclopean stairs can form. One way they form is through plucking. Different bedrock types may be more susceptible to plucking. If a highly jointed layer of bedrock is on the surface, large portions of it will be picked up by the glacier and deposited later as a glacial erratic. The valley formed in this fashion may have a steep wall at its head caused by a change in the bedrock type. The stronger bedrock will remain in the form of a riser at the end of a hanging valley. Cyclopean stairs can also form at points where tributary glaciers feed into larger central glaciers. The tributary glacier causes the central glacier to thicken and downcut more rapidly. This may cause a very sudden drop in the valley floor at the points where the glaciers converged. They may also form at the head of a glacier. In an area where the snowline is rising, the cirque in which the glacier forms my recede. A new cirque may form above the previous cirque and carve out a new step. As the snowline continues to rise, new cirques would continue to form the steps of the cyclopean stairs. References Surface Processes and Landforms, Don J. Easterbrook.

Life Allied with his contemporary and second cousin Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona, together they shared in the process of erosion of the comital authority to the noblesse. They also cooperated in the Reconquista and he received a third part of the conquests, occupying, in 1050, Camarasa and Cubells after taking them from Yusuf of Lleida. In 10391040, Ermengol and Raymond Berengar signed a pact against Raymond of Cerdanya. Later in that decade, Raymond Berenger paid 20,000 solidi for Ermengol's support and military aid. He took part in the Barbastro War of 1064 under the banner of his brother-in-law Sancho Ram√≠rez of Aragon. When Barbastro was captured, he was given the lordship of the city. He died before 12 April 1065 defending the city from Moorish reprisals and was buried at the Monastery of San Pedro de Ager.

At the end of Season 4, Trance Gemini transports all the main characters to the Seefra system. The system has two dim suns, Methus-1 and Methus-2, along with nine identical barren worlds, Seefra-1 through Seefra-9. The population of the system is highly superstitious and technology, especially spaceflight, is shunned. The planets are in constant drought, so water is treasured. Flavin, a Paradine, meets Dylan here, giving him cryptic hints about Dylan's destiny and what Seefra is before disappearing. Seefra-1 is revealed to be the planet Tarn-Vedra, center of the Vedran Empire and subsequent Systems Commonwealth for thousands of years, as discovered by Dylan Hunt during Season 5. Eight of the nine planets in the Seefra system, from Seefra-9 through Seefra-2, are destroyed during Season 5, as Trance Gemini's sun (Trance is the avatar representation of \\"her\\" sun) enters the system to become the new Seefran/Vedran sun. Not only are the eight planets destroyed, but the manufactured Methus suns are consumed as well. The new Vedran sun comes to a stop before reaching Seefra-1, revealing that the consumption of the other eight planets and the Methus suns was part of an elaborate braking system - by design. Much of Season 5 centers on: the discovery and decoding of the Methus Diagram which is a blueprint of the Methus suns; the repair of the sun Methus-2, and; the evacuation of Seefra-9 through Seefra-2, as the new sun consumes the planetary system.

In geology and geomorphology, a hogback or hog's back is a long, narrow ridge or a series of hills with a narrow crest and steep slopes of nearly equal inclination on both flanks. Typically, the term is restricted to a ridge created by the differential erosion of outcropping, steeply dipping (greater than 30‚Äì40¬∞), homoclinal, and typically sedimentary strata. One side of a hogback (its backslope) consists of the surface (bedding plane) of a steeply dipping rock stratum called a dip slope. The other side (its escarpment, frontslope or \\"scarp slope\\") is an erosion face that cuts through the dipping strata that comprises the hogback.Huggett, JR (2011) Fundamentals of Geomorphology, 3rd ed., Routledge, New York. 516 pp. Cotton, CA (1952) Geomorphology An Introduction to the Study of Landforms, 6th ed.

American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp. The name \\"hogback\\" comes from the Hog's Back of the North Downs in Surrey, England, which refers to the landform's resemblance in outline to the back of a hog. The term is also sometimes applied to drumlins and, in Maine, to both eskers and ridges known as \\"horsebacks\\". Hogbacks are a typical regional topographic expression of outcrops of steeply dipping strata, commonly sedimentary strata, that consist of alternating beds of hard, well- lithified strata, i.e. sandstone and limestone, and either weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. shale, mudstone, and marl. The surface of a hard, erosion-resistant layer forms the back slope (dip-slope) of the hogback where weaker strata have been preferentially stripped off of it by erosion. The opposite slope that forms the front of a hogback, which is its escarpment or scarp, consists of a slope that cuts across the bedding of the strata. Because of the steeply dipping nature of the strata that forms a hogback, a slight shift in location may take place as the landscape is lowered by erosion, but it will be a matter of feet rather than miles, as might happen with cuestas.Thornbury, W. D., 1954, \\"Principles of Geomorphology New York, John Wiley & Sons, 618 pp. All gradations occur between hogbacks, homoclinal ridges, and cuestas. The differences between these landforms are related to the steepness in dip of the resistant beds from which they have been eroded and to their geographic extent. Where each type occurs depends upon whether the local rock attitudes are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. Because of their gradational nature, the exact angle of dip and slope that separates these landforms is arbitrary and some differences in the specific angles used to define these landforms can be found in the scientific literature. It also can be difficult to distinguish immediately adjacent members of this series of landforms. Examples of hogbacks =Europe= United Kingdom *Hog's Back, of the North Downs in Surrey, England; the original hogback from which the landform derives its name. Formed from a monoclinal fold, leading to steeply dipping chalk beds which are more resistant to erosion than the flanking clays. Belgium *The Richelsley in the western North Eifel, Belgium. Germany *The Teufelsmauer (\\"Devil's Wall\\") in the northern Harz Foreland. *The Externsteine in the Teutoburg Forest. *The Ith, a knife-edge ridge in the Weser Uplands. =North America= Colorado Dinosaur Ridge, west of Denver, Colorado. It is formed by the more erosion-resistant sandstones of the Dakota Formation protecting the softer, less erosion-resistant strata of the Morrison Formation. Hogsback up Bald Mountain, in the Adirondacks of New York Dinosaur Ridge is a well known hogback that is part of Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark within Morrison, Colorado. It is a hogback formed by the differential erosion of well-cemented sandstones of the Cretaceous Dakota Formation, which form the dip slope of this hogback, overlying the less erosion-resistant and interbedded mudstone, siltstone, and thinly-bedded sandstones of the Morrison Formation of Jurassic age. Dinosaur Ridge is only a short segment of the Dakota Hogback that extends the length of the Front Range from Wyoming to southern Colorado.Lockley, M, and L.

The Dakota Sandstone Hogback encircles the Black Hills, an elliptical dome spanning from northwestern South Dakota to northeastern Wyoming. The Black Hills are approximately long and wide. The Dakota Hogback ridge formed when the resistant sandstones of the Dakota Sandstone and underlying strata were uplifted near the center of the present-day Black Hills because of a granite intrusion, approximately 60 million years ago. The Black Hills are the easternmost segment of the Laramide orogeny. The Dakota hogback rim separates the surrounding flat plains from the Red Valley trench of the Black Hills. The ridge \\"presents a steep face towards the valley and rises several hundred feet above it.Darton, NH (1909) Geology and water resources of the northern portion of the Black Hills and adjoining regions in South Dakota and Wyoming.

It is a circular dome about across and wide surrounded by a rim of triangular hogbacks (similar in appearance to flatirons). Green Mountain itself, much like the nearby Black Hills, is a laccolith formed by the intrusion of magma into the Earth's crust.Cleland, HF (1916) Geology, Physical and Historical.
