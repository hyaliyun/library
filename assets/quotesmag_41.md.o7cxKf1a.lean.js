The facilities are maintained by the Coronado National Forest division of the USDA Forest Service. The lake was created in 1957 by the Arizona Game and Fish Department.Back then this lake was known for a plush resort that was located there. In 2008, the lake was closed to clean mercury contamination within the sediment, thought to be from old mines in the area. Also the former plush resort was removed as well. The lake was reopened in August 2009. In 2013, an Arizona Department of Environmental Quality report showed that mercury levels were similar to those before the lake was drained and dredged. One potential cause for the high mercury could be naturally occurring mercury seeping through the faults or a spring in the lake, though these claims are still under investigation. Fish species Before Pe√±a Blanca Lake was drained the fish population consisted of largemouth bass, bluegill, redear sunfish, green sunfish, black crappie, channel catfish, and black bullhead. Stocked rainbow trout could be found in the lake as well. Today the fish species that inhabit the lake are channel catfish, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and redear sunfish.

Enterprise Agents are available for Linux, OSX, Windows, Solaris, Microsoft SQL Server, a variety of browsers, and more. Snare Enterprise Epilog for Windows facilitates the central collection and processing of Windows text-based log files such as ISA/IIS. Snare Enterprise Epilog for Unix provides a method to collect any text based log files on the Linux and Solaris operating systems. Opensource Agents are available for Irix and AIX. Snare is currently used by hundreds of thousands of individuals and organisations worldwide to meet local and federal information security guidelines associated with auditing and eventlog collection. Snare for Windows - Objective configuration History The Snare series of agents began life in 2001 when the team at InterSect Alliance created a Linux kernel module to implement Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria auditing at the C2 level. Agents for Windows, and Solaris soon followed, and additional operating systems, and applications were added to the mix over time. The Snare Server software was originally designed to meet the needs of Australian-based intelligence agency clients, and distribution was restricted to Australia only. The need for a server solution to complement the increasingly popular Snare agents, pushed the InterSect Alliance team to find overseas partners, and allow distribution internationally. Distribution Snare has been described as the 'De Facto standard for Windows event retrieval', and because of its deep roots in the open source movement, coupled with available commercial support options, is used by small non-profit organisations, right up to huge multinational, Fortune-500 companies. Organisations that produce audit server software that competes with the Snare Server software, such as Cisco, Sensage, and LogLogic , all use and recommend the Snare agents to their customers. Most agents have both a supported commercial, and an open-source version available. Design The Snare agents have been designed to collect audit log data from a host system, and push the data as quickly as possible, to a central server (or servers), for archive, analysis, and reporting. The central server can be either a syslog server, a Snare Server appliance, or a custom application. Snare agents are also able to push logs over a unidirectional network in order to facilitate log transfer from networks of low classification to networks of higher classification. The Snare Server is an appliance, or software-only solution, that provides a variety of analysis tools and to facilitate the collection, analysis, reporting, and archival of audit log data.

It is surrounded by Horshim forest to the west, Rosh HaAyin and Kfar Qasim to the southwest, Sha'arei Tikva to the east, and Khirbet Abu Salman to the northeast. In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. History According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from two nearby Palestinian villages in order to construct Oranit: most of the land was taken from Azzun Atma,‚ÄòAzzun ‚ÄòAtma Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 16 while 6 dunams from ‚ÄòIzbat Salman.The Western ‚ÄòIzab Locality Profile (including ‚ÄòIzbat Jal‚Äôud, ‚ÄòIzbat Salman, ‚ÄòIzbat al Mudawwar & ‚ÄòIzbat al Ashqar), ARIJ, p. 20 In April 1983, the Israeli government approved the establishment of Oranit, one of three settlements planned for \\"western Samaria\\". According to Amnesty International the majority of the land of the neighboring Palestinian village of 'Izbat Salman was lost when Oranit was established, with most of the remainder being effectively lost when the West Bank barrier was built to encompass Oranit and enough surrounding land for future expansion of the settlement. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East has estimated that three Palestinian villages in the vicinity lost 3,000 dunams of land with the creation of Oranit settlement. Thirty Palestinian farmers were initially given access to their farmland through the gates of the settlement. This right was soon withdrawn for \\"security reasons\\" and the settlement has since expanded onto this Palestinian farmland. In 1985, the first residents moved in. In 1990, Oranit achieved local council status. In 2009, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu imposed a 10-month freeze on construction in Oranit and other Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Building inspectors of the Israeli military's civil administration issued a stop-work order, sending home a crew of Palestinian laborers who had been employed at a building site in Oranit. According to Zvika Ma-Yafit, former mayor of Oranit, the town maintains good relations with nearby Kafr Qasim and the two towns have cooperated on environmental projects such as the development of a joint sewage system. Many residents of Kafr Qasim work in Oranit as gardeners and handymen.'Quality of life' is theme for bedroom community of Oranit He says the motive for moving to Oranit is not ideological but quality of life. Demographics According to a 2009 survey, the population is young and evenly divided between men and women. Around 15% of the population is Orthodox, two-thirds of whom live in the town's religious neighborhood. Oranit ranked 8 out of 10 on the Israeli socio-economic scale. Education and culture View of Oranit from Horshim forest In an educational project at MultiCenter, a computer center at Park Afek industrial zone, Jewish and Arab youngsters from Oranit, Rosh Ha'ayin and Kafr Qasim created a computer model for a virtual city of coexistence. According to the project director, the children learn about each other's language and culture, discuss strategies for promoting tolerance and avoiding violence, and use a program developed by MultiCenter to create a virtual dream city, complete with a map, logo and charter.

Company history Republic Industries was created as a waste disposal firm in 1981. H. Wayne Huizenga, became chairman of the board in 1995. At that time Republic Industries began acquiring auto dealerships and car rental agencies. In 1998, Republic Industries spun off Republic Services as an IPO then changed its name to AutoNation. In June 2008, Republic became the second largest waste management company in the U.S. following the acquisition of its larger competitor, Allied Waste Industries, for $6.1 billion in Republic stock. The merged company retained the Republic Services name. The Wall Street Journal reported in June 2010 that Republic Services‚Äô $4 billion acquisition of Allied in December 2008 \\"has been successful from the start\\", delivering at the high end of the annual savings projected when they did the deal ($191 million), a 27% increase in share price. After 12 years as CEO of Republic Services, James O‚ÄôConnor retired on January 1, 2011. Replacing him was the president and COO of Republic Services, Donald Slager. In May 2019 Jon Vander Ark took over as president of the company. James P. Snee and Katharine Weymouth were appointed to the Republic Services Board of Directors in 2018, resulting in a total of 12 board members, 11 of them independent. Based on annual report published in 2018, with a revenue of $10 billion, the firm retained the number two position in the industry. Operations Republic Services‚Äô operations primarily consist of providing collection, transfer and disposal of non-hazardous solid waste, recovering and recycling of certain materials, and energy services. As of December 31, 2017, it operated in 40 states and Puerto Rico through 343 collection operations, 204 transfer stations, 195 active landfills, 90 recycling centers, 7 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, and 11 salt water disposal wells. Republic also operated 68 landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 124 closed landfills. In January 2016, Republic realigned its field support functions by combining its three regions into two field groups, consolidating its areas and streamlining select operational support roles at its Phoenix headquarters. =Fleet= According to Fleet Owner 500, 2017, Republic Services ranked 7 in the U.S. in total number of trucks in service with 16,000. Renewable natural gas usage Republic Services announced in May 2017 that it will increase its usage of renewable natural gas (RNG) by a factor of three above what it used in 2016. They will also reduce usage of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) by about 110,000 metric tons by their fleet over the coming three years with an expanded agreement with Clean Energy. Fleet automation Approximately 75% of its residential routes have been converted to automated single driver trucks. By converting its residential routes to automated service, they reduce labor costs, improve driver productivity, decrease emissions, and create a safer employee work environment. Additionally, communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs, thereby complementing its initiative to expand its recycling capabilities. Fleet conversion to compressed natural gas (CNG) As of November 2016, Republic Services operated a fleet of almost 2,500 CNG-powered vehicles, supported by 38 natural gas fueling stations. According to the company, their CNG fleet helped to save about 21 million gallons of diesel fuel. In August 2016 Republic Services opened a new Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fueling station in Long Beach, California. The station will serve the recent addition of 56 CNG-powered garbage trucks which replaced their old diesel trucks. With this addition of CNG trucks the total number of alternative fuel vehicles operating in Long Beach is 147. In Broward and Dade Counties in South Florida Republic Services added 62 CNG trucks to their collection fleet in April 2016. The addition brought the total number of trucks to 127. In Central Contra Costa County Republic Services added 40 Compressed Natural Gas solid waste collection trucks to its fleet. The CNG trucks replaced diesel-powered garbage collection trucks. As of April 2016 the total number of CNG trucks operated by Republic in Contra Costa County was 123. In Portland, Republic Services added 16 CNG solid waste collection trucks to its fleet in April, 2016. In St. Louis the company added four CNG solid waste collection trucks to its fleet, bringing the total number of CNG trucks in the region to 107. Approximately 19% of its fleet operates on CNG. During 2017 about 30% of the company's replacement vehicle purchases were CNG vehicles. As of December 31, 2017, they operated 37 CNG fueling stations. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Republic Services added eight CNG trucks in November, 2015, bringing the total number of CNG trucks in North Carolina to 25. Republic Services brought the number of CNG trucks operating in Colorado up to 82 with an addition of 17 trucks in the greater Denver area.  Standardized vehicle maintenance  In order to improve important aspects of vehicle safety, environmental impact, and vehicle service life, the company implemented standardized maintenance programs for 100% of its fleet as of December 31, 2017. =Landfills= Republic Services owns or operates 195 active landfills. They also have responsibility for 124 closed landfills, for which they have associated closure and post-closure obligations. Republic Services owns and operates the largest landfill in the United States at 2,200 acres (890 ha) located in Apex, Nevada. In 2008, at the time that Republic Services bought Allied Waste, it acquired two closed St. Louis, Missouri landfills, West Lake and Bridgeton. An underground event (more accurately referred to as a ‚Äúsmoldering event‚Äù) was detected in the closed Bridgeton Landfill. Due to the odors emitted from the landfill and its proximity to the adjacent West Lake‚Äîan EPA-managed Super Fund site which contains low-level radioactive waste dumped there illegally over forty years ago‚Äîenvironmental groups got involved. Republic operates the Bridgeton Landfill near St. Louis, Missouri. The landfill is the site of an underground event of concern to residents and the EPA. = Recycling centers = Republic owns or operates 90 recycling centers that process over 6 million tons of recyclables annually. These facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard (OCC), old newspaper (ONP), aluminum, glass and other materials, which accounted for approximately 5% of their revenue during 2017. Approximately 77% of its recycling center volume relates to OCC, ONP and other mixed paper. Of the 5.0 million tons they sold during 2017, 2.5 million moved through its recycling centers and 2.5 million they collected and delivered to third parties. In June 2016 the company, together with Lab USA, announced the launch of a state-of-the-art ash metal recovery facility at the Roosevelt Regional Landfill in Roosevelt, Washington. The high-tech process allows metals which would otherwise have been lost into the environment to be reclaimed, recycled, shipped to manufacturers and repurposed as new metal products. The facility systematically extracts metal from ash that is already found in the landfill in addition to all newly delivered ash. The facility recovers and recycles more than 46,200 tons of ferrous metals and 42,900 tons of non-ferrous metals. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, recycling iron uses 20 percent less energy in production than extracting iron from natural resources. Recycling copper saves about 60 percent of the energy which would be needed to mine copper. Use of this facility will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On Earth Day, April 22, 2016, Republic Services announced enhancements they made to the Anaheim Recycling Center. The new system can handle over 1000 tons of recyclables each day, or 100 tons per hour. At the end of 2015, Republic Services opened a $35 million, 110,000 square-foot North Las Vegas Recycling Center, designed by local architect, Edward Vance of EV&A; Architects. The plant's solar panels generate enough energy to run the plant for two to three months. The plant can process two million pounds of recycled paper each day, or 70 tons per hour. Eventually the plant will be able to recycle three million pounds of paper per day. Optical sorters use 2D and 3D technologies to speed sorting. Low-flow water fixtures in the building will reduce water consumption by 20%. In early 2015 Republic Services invested $19 million in a St. Louis recycling center upgrade of the company's state-of-the-art Northside Recycling Center. The upgraded center is able to produce 25 tons of baled recycled material an hour. Ninety-two percent of the material that comes through the center is then sold to be remade into new products. In April 2019 Republic Services opened a state-of-the-art recycling and waste disposal center in Plano, Texas, replacing the facility that had burned down in December 2016. Regulation Republic Services, along with all other waste and recycling companies, are subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other facilities that they own or operate. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local authorities administer these regulations. Customer service centers In January 2016, the company said it will invest $20 million during 2016 to design and implement its Customer Resource Centers in addition to other customer focused initiatives. The company expects the changes to result in a yearly savings of about $10 million. The plan calls for the consolidation of 108 regional customer centers into three main customer resource centers in Fishers, Indiana, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chandler, Arizona. In February 2016 it was announced by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and N.C. Commerce Secretary John E. Skvareta, III, that Republic Services was planning to open a full-service Customer Resource Center in Charlotte. It is expected that the facility will create over 350 new jobs, while Republic's investment in the Center is projected to be over $6.8 million over the next three years. In April 2017, Republic Services opened a customer service center in Fishers, Indiana, employing over 250 workers, with plans to hire an additional 120 during the year. The company invested $13.6 million to renovate and equip office space along the I-69 corporate corridor in Fishers. The customer service office is expected to create up to 469 new jobs by 2025. Corporate responsibility, sustainability and innovation Republic Services puts a substantial percentage of its earnings- 45 percent- into developing new technologies and initiating new programs across the US. The company has also been an industry leader in advancing new technologies, including converting landfill gas to energy, solar energy products, and a natural gas fleet. The company has developed programs that will enable it to reduce emissions by 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the next four years, including developing at least two landfill gas-to-energy projects each year, adding at least 150,000 tons per year of recycling capacity, and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from its fleet by 3% by 2018. At the end of 2015, 40 companies participated in an inaugural business tour in Seattle highlighting the regenerative model of what has become known as the circular economy. Those in attendance, including Jennifer Gerholdt, the environment and sustainability director at the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation, toured Republic Services as well as General Biodiesel, Phillips, PCC Markets/Wiserg and others. Republic Services scored in the 90th percentile of the Commercial Services and Supplies sector of the 2016 Dow Jones Sustainability‚ÄîNorth America Index‚Ñ¢ (DJSI), and was also named to the 2016 DJSI World and North America indices. Republic is the only recycling and solid waste collection provider in the Commercial Services and Supplies sector that is included in the 2016 DJSI World Index. The rankings highlight Republic's leadership in corporate governance, environmental, social and financial aspects of sustainability. The Blue Planet sustainability initiative is Republic Services‚Äô approach to corporate social responsibility through their efforts to reduce emissions from operations; improve materials management; improve safety standards; increase community engagement; and a focus on employee growth opportunities. At the end of August, 2017, the company released its most recent Sustainability Report describing how well it was able to advance its sustainability initiatives. In September 2019, the company became the first US solid waste and recycling provider whose emissions reduction targets were approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative. These goals meet the targets that the Paris Agreement requires. In 2019 Republic Services was acknowledged by Barron's as one of the United States' 100 Most Sustainable Companies, the second consecutive year. The company was listed on Forbes as one of the country's best employers for women, the only Arizona- based company to do so. =Recycling= In partnership with the Alabama Coastal Foundation (ACF) Republic Services launched an oyster shell collection program in May 2017 with several coastal restaurants. Funded by a two-year grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the goal of the collection program is to create sustainable oyster habitats and to teach the public about the importance of oyster shell recycling. In just over nine months the ACF collected 10.1 acres of shells, which were recycled back into the Gulf of Mexico, creating new habitats for baby oysters, shrimp and crab. In Missoula, Montana Republic Services launched an expanded recycling program in response to demand made by the citizens of the city. On April 19, 2016 Republic Services launched a website to allow easier access to sustainability resources and community tours at the Southern Nevada Recycling Center. The Nevada Center opened in November 2015, and is described as a ‚Äústate-of-the- art‚Äù recycling center. It was designed by Ed Vance & Associates and built by Cambridge Cos., of Griffith, Indiana. The facility is 110,000 square feet, making it the largest residential recycling plant in the country. In partnership with the city of Chesterfield, and USAgain, Republic Services launched a new program offering curbside textile recycling in Chesterfield, Missouri. The program began in April 2016. In September 2015 the Buffalo Bills partnered with Republic Services for the third year in a row to encourage and support recycling during the football team's home games. The goal was to maintain the cleanliness of the parking lot at Ralph Wilson Stadium by handing out recycling bags and garbage bags to fans who participate in tailgating. The University of Nevada Las Vegas partnered with Republic Services of Southern Nevada in September 2015 to participate in the GameDay Recycling Challenge. The challenge is a competition between 72 college football teams across the United States. At the end of August 2017, Republic Services signed a deal of purchase ReCommunity Holdings, the largest independent recycling-processing company in the United States. ReCommunity operates 26 recycling centers in 14 states, manufacturing reusable items from waste. ReCommunity's plants recover about 1.6 million tons of recyclable commodities annually, which will help Republic Services achieve their \\"Blue Planet\\" sustainable initiative of adding at least 150,000 tons of recycling capacity per year by 2018. The company implements a Recycling Simplified Education Program which includes K-12 lesson plans, a website which explains what can and cannot be recycled, and other information to help educate the public about recycling. The program won the 2019 Best Recycling Public Education Program Award. =Solar energy= In 2017 the company invested $29 million in solar projects at some of their landfills and other locations. Republic Services has either built, invested in or operates over 236,000 solar panels at 19 generating facilities in the US, with total capacity of 80 megawatts, enough electricity to power 208,000 homes. In September 2017, Republic Services and Soltage activated a 13.5 megawatt solar energy project in Massachusetts. When finished, the project, constructed on three former landfill sites, will include approximately 41,000 solar panels to power 1,900 local households and reduce carbon emissions by more than 14,000 tons. In 2018 the company, in partnership with New Jersey Resources, launched a 40,000 solar panel project in South Brunswick. Built on an old landfill, the site can generate 13 MW of electricity, enough to power 1,360 homes each year. It will reduce CO2 emissions by 14,000 tons, equal to taking 2,700 cars off the road every year, according to the EPA. =Composting= In April 2016 the city of Boise, Idaho considered the implementation of a composting program, utilizing Republic Services, the company that was already hauling garbage in the city. The program went into effect in June 2017. After a little more than one month the company picked up 1,716 tons of compost from Boise's single- family homes. On May 6, 2010 Allied Waste, a Republic Services company, upgraded its Pacific Region Compost Facility (PRC) with the state's first food composting facility. The facility accepts all food waste including meat, bread and vegetable products, which per the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is almost 15 percent of the material landfilled in Oregon. Allied Waste paved 2 acres (8,100 m2) and purchased and installed a composting system that has been used successfully in Washington and California called ‚Äúaerated static pile technology.‚Äù It captures and controls emissions from the composting process using a negative air system. It has a smaller footprint than other methods, and reduces the amount of storm water runoff. =Landfill gas to energy (LFGTE)= The Pinehill Landfill in Longview, Texas will generate 404 million cubic feet of renewable natural gas per year, taking the place of over 19 million gallons of gas annually, with a concomitant reduction in carbon emissions. In July 2016 Republic Services and Mas Energy launched a new renewable energy project to serve the metropolitan Atlanta area. The project includes three landfill gas-to-energy facilities in Buford, Griffin and Winder. The facilities will produce 24.1 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 15,665 households. The three facilities together will be the largest landfill gas-to-energy project in Georgia. Republic Services converts landfill gas, the natural byproduct of decomposing waste, to energy. The use of landfill gas is beneficial to the U.S. economy by reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane. As of July 2016, Republic Services operated 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. In April 2015 Republic Services opened a landfill gas-to-energy project near Los Angeles at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill. The 20-megawatt renewable energy project has the ability to supply enough electricity to power almost 25,000 homes in the area. In January 2010, the EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) selected three Republic Services landfill gas-to-energy projects (LFGTE) as LFGTE Projects of the Year for 2009. Ox Mountain Landfill in Half Moon Bay, California; Jefferson City Landfill in Jefferson City, Missouri and Oak Grove Landfill in Winder, Georgia were honored at the annual LMOP conference in Baltimore in January 2010. Republic Services developed LFGTE projects at 73 of its 213 landfills, including 52 electric generating plants, 13 medium Btu plants that provide LFG to industrial users, 6 high Btu plants that produce pipeline quality gas and 3 leachate evaporators; The 52 electric projects generate 323 MW of electricity, enough to power about 250,000 homes. The 22 other projects provide or process more than 58,000 scfm of gas, energy needed to heat almost 200,000 homes, the combined benefits equivalent to removing about 4 million cars off the road. In 2008, Republic Services agreed to pay a $1 million fine and up to $36 million in remediation costs for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act at a closed landfill in Clark County, Nevada. In 2007, Republic Services was fined $725,000 by the State of California related to hazardous waste leaking from a closed landfill into San Francisco Bay.Landfill Owners, Toxics Agency Settle  San Francisco Chronicle, Jane Kay, October 23, 2007 = Charitable giving = In August 2018, Republic Services launched its first companywide charitable giving program: National Neighborhood Promise. Lobbying In 2014, Republic Services gave $50,000 to Missouri Republicans to their House and Senate campaign committees and $20,000 to House and Senate committees for Missouri Democrats. Criticism and controversy Republic Services is identified by the EPA as one of four potential responsible parties for the EPA Superfund cleanup site West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri. Its contents have been shown to include radioactive waste and it was featured in the 2017 HBO documentary Atomic Homefront. In 2013 the company said it would build a barrier to separate the section with a subsurface smoldering fire from the section with radioactive waste, but because the EPA was uncertain where the radioactive contamination was located, progress on the barrier was delayed for more than a year. In response to criticism that the EPA was not moving quickly enough to clean up West Lake Landfill, Republic Services spent between $10,000 and $100,000 on advertising in 2015, according to spokesman Russ Knocke. This included employing representatives to criticize community activists on social media. In March 2016 the EPA released studies which showed the extent of the radioactive waste on the site and allowed the company to build a barrier without disturbing the radioactive areas. During the construction of the barrier Republic also must submit plans for a cooling system, which must be completed within four months of commencement of construction. The company will also enlarge onto the north quarry of Bridgeton Landfill a plastic liner that it already installed over the south quarry. Environmental Protection Agency Region 7 Administrator Mark Hague said this should help control the reaction by blocking oxygen ‚Äúas well as mitigate some of the odors coming off of this site.‚Äù Republic will also install more temperature monitors plus two sulfur dioxide monitors to track unhealthy emissions. They will also be required to develop a system which can quickly extinguish any new hot spots that the underground event might create.

Built in 1845, it was the home of Roswell Field, an attorney for Dred Scott in the landmark Dred Scott v. Sandford court case. Field's son, Eugene Field, was raised there and became a noted writer of children's stories. A National Historic Landmark, it is now a museum known as the Field House Museum. (Previously known as The Eugene Field House & St. Louis Toy Museum.) Description The Field House is located just south of Downtown St. Louis, at the northeast corner of South Broadway and Cerre Street. It is largely surrounded by parking lots, with Interstate 64 a short way to the north. It is a three-story brick building, three bays wide, with a side gable roof whose end wall sections are raised. The entrance is in the leftmost bay, in a panelled recess. The windows have stone sills and lintels. History The house was built in 1845, and was once part of a row of similar buildings called Walsh's Row. Most of these were torn down in the 20th century. Threatened with demolition, the house was transferred to the St. Louis Board of Education in 1936. Restored with funding from local preservationists, it opened as a museum to Eugene Field later that year. It was turned over to the Landmarks Association of St. Louis in 1968, and to the Eugene Field House Foundation in 1981. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2007, for its association with attorney Roswell Field, who was Eugene Field's father, and a lead attorney for Dred Scott. Field's legal work set the stage for Scott's final appeal to the United States Supreme Court, which was rejected in the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision, in which Chief Justice Roger B. Taney issued a decision denying African Americans United States citizenship. A plaque on the home was dedicated in 1902 with the help of author Mark Twain, who announced it as the birthplace of Eugene Field. Field's brother Roswell, however, noted that he was born elsewhere. Twain brushed the fact aside, telling him, \\"Officially and for the purposes of the future, your brother was born here.\\" The inaccurate plaque remains.Cuoco, Lorin and William H. Gass (editors).

It was entirely in French and was operated by the Free French who had escaped from occupied France. It served not only to counter the propaganda broadcasts of German- controlled Radio Paris and the Vichy government's Radiodiffusion Nationale, but also to appeal to the French to rise up, as well as being used to send coded messages to the French Resistance. Origin and purpose Commemorative plaque of Radio Londres in the cemetery of Asnelles, Calvados In 1940, the BBC opened its studio to the first members of the resistance who fled France's occupation by Germany. Radio Londres was born and would become the daily appointment of the French people for four years. It opened its transmission with : \\"Ici Londres ! Les Fran√ßais parlent aux Fran√ßais...\\" (\\"This is London! The French speaking to the French...\\"), now a very famous quote in France. It was the voice of Free French Forces under Charles de Gaulle, who, on 18 June 1940, made his famous Appeal of 18 June, inviting his compatriots to resist and rise against the occupation. By means of broadcasts from Britain, the French Resistance found a voice that could be heard on the continent, serving to counter the Nazi propaganda broadcasts of Radio Paris and Radio-Vichy. Realizing the negative effect that it had on their occupation, the Germans quickly prohibited listening to Radio Londres. Radio Londres also encouraged rising up against the occupation, including De Gaulle's calls to empty the streets of Paris for one hour, demonstrations, and the preparation of D-Day, or the V for Victory campaign, involving drawing a V sign on walls as an act of subversion. It also sent coded messages to the French resistance (see below). Breaking with the formal style of the French radio stations, some young announcers (Jacques Duchesne, Jean Oberl√©, Pierre Bourdan, Maurice Schumann and Pierre Dac) changed the tone with personal messages, sketches, songs, jokes and comic advertising. Coded messages Charles de Gaulle (pictured) made several broadcasts on Radio Londres during the war Georges B√©gu√©, an operative with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) had the idea of sending seemingly obscure personal messages to agents in the field, in order to reduce risky radio traffic. Broadcasts would begin with \\"Before we begin, please listen to some personal messages.\\" It was clear to nearly everyone that they were coded messages, often amusing, and completely without context. Representative messages include \\"Jean has a long mustache\\" and \\"There is a fire at the insurance agency,\\" each one having some meaning to a certain resistance group. They were used primarily to provide messages to the resistance, but also to thank their agents or simply to give the enemy the impression that something was being prepared. Because these messages were in code, not cipher, the occupiers could not hope to understand them without a codebook, so they had to focus their efforts on jamming the messages instead. From the beginning of June 1944, the Allies inundated the network with messages. On 1 June alone, over 200 messages were sent, making it clear to those listening that something was in the works. Although in some places the Axis jamming was more effective than others, the background noise and static were not enough to drown out the sound of Beethoven's 5th Symphony, the first four notes of which correspond to the dot-dot-dot-dash of the Morse code letter V for Victory. Shortly before the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, Radio Londres broadcast the first stanza of Paul Verlaine's poem \\"Chanson d'automne\\" to let the resistance know that the invasion was imminent. The first part of the stanza, Les sanglots longs des violons de l‚Äôautomne (\\"the long sobs of the violins of autumn\\") indicated that the invasion would begin within 24 hours; the second, Blessent mon c≈ìur d'une langueur monotone (\\"wound my heart with a monotonous languor\\") was the specific call to action. By late 1944, Allied victory in France sounded the end of Radio Londres.

French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the village in 1870, and he found it to have about 350 inhabitants. The village appeared ancient, with old masonry reused in houses and walls. The village had an excellent supply of water which was collected in a pool, near the steps down was a beautifully carved niche with a shell motif. This pool provided water for gardens of olive and pomegranate trees.Gu√©rin, 1875, pp. 162-3 In the 1882 PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP), Yasuf is described as, \\"an ancient village,\\" located in a valley, with a Roman road passing nearby.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 378. Inside the village is \\"a good spring ... and olives. A beautiful garden of pomegranates exists north of the spring. The water comes out of a cleft in a cliff, near which is an ancient well with steps. There is a sacred place, with a large oak (Sindian), and a ruined shrine, south-west of the village, near 'Ain er Raja. There are drafted stones in many houses, and remains of well-built enclosures, now ruined. Many well-cut rock tombs are also found on either side.\\" Also in the village were, \\"rock-cut tombs with kokim [...]\\". A subterranean channel led out from the spring that contained small fish and there were pillar shafts there too.

In the early 17th century, Deir Istiya and nearby Beit Wazan were the ancestral seats of the Qasim family who controlled Jamma'in and most of eastern Sanjak Nablus. The Qasim fortified and made Deir Istiya their primary southern base. The Rayyan clan from Majdal Yaba also exercised some influence over the village.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 184. In 1838, Edward Robinson noted it as a village, Deir Estia, in the Jurat Merda district, south of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 127 During the \\"civil war\\" period in Jabal Nablus (1853‚Äì57), the Qasim family, formerly led by Qasim al-Ahmad, vacated Deir Istiya and were said to have sought refuge with the Nimr family in Nablus.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 215 In the second half of the 19th century, the village was ruled by the Abu Hijleh clan, who continue to live there. The Abu Hijleh were dominant in the area, and had great wealth.Doumani, 1995, p. 174. In 1870 French scholar Victor Gu√©rin remarked that Deir Istiya had been much larger and that it was probably inhabited since \\"ancient times,\\" noting that in the Mosque of Deir Istiya were marble columns (some with chiseled out crucifixes) dating back to the Christian era in Palestine.Sharon, 2004, p. 62Guerin, 1875, p. 160, partly translated in Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 315 In 1882 Deir Istiya was described as \\"a large village on high ground, surrounded with olive-groves, and supplied by cisterns.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 284 =British Mandate era= The British wrested control of Palestine from the Ottomans in 1917, and in 1921, a resident was publicly beat to death in Deir Istiya for allegedly possessing weapons. The British appointed the role of leadership to one branch of Abu Hijleh clan, fomenting rivalry with the other branch. The British established a school in the village in 1923.

Since the 1967 war, Deir Istiya has been held under Israeli occupation. Throughout the first part of the occupation by Israel, from 1967 to 1990, nearly half of the population emigrated to Kuwait or other Persian Gulf States. In the 1970s local resistance in the form of sumud increased in the village, including the raising of Palestinian flags, graffiti, and blocking roads. As a result, in 1974, about 50 men were arrested and served prison terms ranging from six months to three years. After the 1995 accords, 17% of village land was classified as Area B land, while the remaining 83% is Area C.Deir Istiya Town Profile, ARIJ, p. 17 Israel has expropriated land from Deir Istiya in order to construct several Israeli settlements: *951 dunams for Emmanuel,Deir Istiya Town Profile, ARIJ, p. 18 *920 dunams for Ginnot Shomeron, *659 dunams for Yakir, *625 dunams for Nofim, *512 dunams for Karne Shomron, *335 dunams for Revava, *69 dunams for Ma'ale Shomron The Israel Nature and Parks Authority has established a nature reserve in the Wadi Qana, occupying privately owned Palestinian farmland which had been worked before the Israeli authorities declared it a park. In 2012 the Israeli Civil Administration ordered local villagers to uproot more than 1,000 olive trees from the area. The residents of Deir Istiya, are contesting the injunction in court. The park, they say, incorporates part of their land, and a double standard is being applied, with Israeli settlements permitted in the area, and a road to one of them built through the park itself.Zafrir Rinat, Israel's Civil Administration orders Palestinians to uproot 1,000 young olive trees in nature reserve,, at Haaretz, 1 May 2012. Islamic structures The Mosque of Deir Istiya located in the middle of the village. It consists of three aisles, each having three bays and nearby are the remains of an ancient wall. To the west of the village is the Mosque of Nabi Allah Amisiya, which consists of two aisles and two bays. The mosque is adjacent to maqam (shrine) Istiya. It is a square chamber with a dome constructed of small stones.Sharon, 2004, p. 65 About 50 meters north of Deir Istiya is a shrine for Nabi Khatir who according to inscriptions, died in 1148 CE.Sharon, 2004, p. 68 Demographics According to Victor Guerin in June 1870, Deir Istiya had roughly 400 inhabitants.Guerin, 1875, p. 160 In the 1922 census of Palestine it had a population of 674 inhabitants, all Muslim, rising to 886 in the 1931 census, still all Muslim, in a total of 206 houses. The Village Statistics, 1945, recorded a population of 1,190, still all Muslim. In 1961, while a part of Jordan, there were 1,641 residents, decreasing drastically after its occupation by Israel with nearly half of the residents gradually emigrating mostly to Kuwait. In 1982, there were 1,500 people living in Deir Istiya, rising to 2,100 in 1987.Welcome to Dayt Istiya In a 1997 census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Deir Istiya had a population of 2,802, of which only 2.1% were Palestinian refugees.Palestinian Population by Locality and Refugee Status Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.

According to the bureau's 2007 census, the town's population had increased to 3,106.Census Final Results ‚Äì Summary (Population, Buildings, Housing, Establishments) Salfit Governorate Economy Old town of Deir Istiya Compared to other villages in the Salfit District, Deir Istiya has a high percentage of professional workers (doctors, office workers, lawyers). About 20% of the people work in government related jobs, with the Palestinian National Authority, mostly police or teachers. Between 1967 and 1993, most of the working inhabitants were employed mainly in farming or labor in Israel, which the village was highly dependent upon. However, after Israel closed the border in 2000 due to the Second Intifada, most of these laborers turned to farming their own fields.Deir Istiya Village Profile International Women's Peace Service. July 2008. Deir Istiya has the largest land area in the Salfit Governorate, and the second largest in the West Bank after Tubas. Since the Intifada, agriculture ‚Äî the backbone of the village's economy ‚Äî has drastically been reduced. Prior to the violence, there were sixteen goat farms and nine dairy farms, decreasing to five goat farms and one dairy farm presently. Olive oil is the main commodity and there are vast amounts of olive trees. Most of the oil is either exported to the Gulf States or sold to Palestinian merchants. There have been moves, with foreign aid, to improve the quality of locally produced olive oil with the intention of marketing it as a high quality product in Europe under the Zaytoun Fairtrade label. This industry is, however, under pressure as a result of Israeli land confiscations and the destruction of olive groves. In particular, in April 2012, notice was served on Palestinian landowners for the destruction of some 1,400 olive trees. Prior to the Intifada, 40 families raised livestock, but this dramatically decreased to just five families after the Intifada. Residents claim that the decrease was due to Israel's confiscation of 20,000 dunams of village lands, and fear of attack by Israeli settlers. In 2008, over 70% of the village was unemployed. There are three oil presses and two marble processing plants in Deir Istiya. Marble is supplied by Hebron, Jenin or imported from Italy. About 15 women are employed in a sewing factory where pieces are received and assembled. Government A village council of eleven members administrates Deir Istiya. The members are nominated by the prominent families of the village, and are approved by the Palestinian National Authority. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, Fatah won three seats, Hamas won three, the Communist Palestinian People's Party won three, including the mayoral seat, and a local group won two seats.Local Elections (Round Three)- Successful lists by local authority and No. of votes obtained Central Elections Commission - Palestine, p. 6.

He was the goalkeeper on the college team that captured the Fitzgibbon Cup title in 1915. Daly won a further five Fitzgibbon Cup titles with the college in 1916, 1917, 1923, 1924 and 1927. After graduation, he practiced medicine in London and regularly returned home for hurling matches. Tommy Daly died in a car accident in Tuamgraney in 1936. Playing career =Club= Daly played his club hurling with his local club in Tulla. After moving to Dublin he joined the local hurling club in UCD. It was with the 'Collegians' that he enjoyed great success as he won three senior county titles in-a-row in 1917, 1918 and 1919. Daly returned to his own native club of Tulla in the early 1930s and captured a county title with that club in 1933. =Inter-county= Daly first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Clare junior hurling team. He won a Munster title with that team in 1914. He later collected an All-Ireland medal in that grade as Clare defeated Laois to take the title. After moving to UCD Daly became the regular goalkeeper on the Dublin hurling team. He captured his first Leinster title in 1917 following a victory over Kilkenny. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted 'the Dubs' against Tipperary. Daly's team had come from nowhere and took on one of the giants of the championship. A 5‚Äì4 to 4‚Äì2 victory gave Dublin the victory and gave Daly his first All-Ireland medal. Dublin surrendered their provincial crown in 1918, however, Kilkenny fell to 'the Dubs' again in 1919 giving Daly his second Leinster medal. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion; however, the Munster champions emerged victorious by 6‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì4. Dublin retained their provincial title in 1920, however, Daly played no part in the Leinster final. He returned to his goalkeeping berth for the subsequent All-Ireland final. The game was a replay of the previous year's encounter as Cork provided the opposition once again. Cork looked to be heading for victory, however, a four- goal blitz by Dublin sealed the 4‚Äì9 to 4‚Äì3 victory and gave Daly a second All- Ireland medal. 1921 saw Daly add a third Leinster memento to his collection before lining out in yet another All-Ireland final. Limerick were the opponents on that occasion, however, the game was not a memorable one for Daly. The score line of 8‚Äì5 to 3-2 resulted in a comprehensive victory for Limerick. Dublin surrendered their provincial crown for the next two years, however, Daly collected a fourth Leinster title in 1924 as Offaly fell in the deciding game. The All-Ireland championship decider pitted Dublin against Galway and an exciting game unfolded. Galway, the reigning champions, took the lead, however, 'the Dubs' fought back and won the game by 5‚Äì3 to 2‚Äì6. Daly had captured his third All-Ireland title and Frank Wall, the Dublin captain, became the only man to accept the Liam MacCarthy Cup without having played in the final. It would be 1927 before Daly won his fifth and final Leinster title. The All-Ireland final saw 'the Dubs' take on Cork once again. Cork, as reigning champions, were the favourites, however, a Dublin team that consisted of nine members of the Garda S√≠och√°na put up a strong defence. They led at half-time and held the lead until the end giving Daly his fourth All-Ireland medal. In 1928 the rule preventing non-residents from playing with their native county was amended. Two years later in 1930 Daly was practicing medicine in London when he signed a non-residents declaration enabling him to play with Clare. That year he lined out in the Munster Championship and even played in the provincial final. Tipperary were the victors on that occasion. Two years later in 1933 Daly was between the posts as Clare defeated Cork, giving him a Munster medal to his already impressive collection of hurling mementos. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Clare line out against Kilkenny. In a low-scoring but exciting game 'the Cats' emerged victorious on a score line of 3‚Äì3 to 2‚Äì3. This defeat brought the curtain down on Daly's inter-county career. =Provincial= Daly also lined out with both Leinster and Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He captured his first Railway Cup medal with Leinster in 1927 in the inaugural year of the competition. In 1934 Daly was the goalkeeper on the Munster side as he collected a second Railway Cup title. Post-playing career In retirement from playing Daly retained a keen interest in the game. Shortly after his retirement he became a highly respected referee of games. In 1935 he took charge of the All-Ireland hurling final between Kilkenny and Limerick.

History According to David Leighton, historian for the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, the origins of Lakeside Lake began with Hal Kinnison. Mr. Kinnison arrived in Tucson in 1909 with his family for his wife's health, taking up residence along The Speedway (now called Speedway Blvd). In 1914, Kinnison started purchasing homesteaded property along the Pantano River (now Pantano Wash)and over the next six years made more land buys close to the original land. At some juncture, Kinnison built a canal and dam which in turn formed a reservoir, on his property from the river runoff, to allow him to water his crops. The reservoir, often called the Kinnison Reservoir, Kinnison Lake or Kinnison Dam existed for several years under Mr. Kinnison's ownership until he lost the land during the Great Depression. Leighton, continued \\"This land soon after became a guest ranch, called El Rancho Pantano and in time became the property of the Atterbury family.

Nambi managed to get palm-leaf manuscripts of the hymns, though some had been eaten away by termites. They were able to recover around ten percent of the entire set of hymns. Nambi also wrote a memoir of the lives of the sixty-three great devotees mentioned by Suntarar; the Tiruttondar Tiruvandhadhi. His hymns in praise of Sambandar and Appar provide some biography of those saints.

Thus far Shiva temples only had images of god forms, but after the advent of Rajaraja, the images of the Nayanar saints were also placed inside the temple.

Driesen was born in 1781 to the military officer and future Governor of Courland, Wilhelm Karl Heinrich von der Osten-Driesen, and his wife, Henrietta Albertina von Bellendorf. Driesen's family had, since the early 14th century, been settled in what is now northwestern Poland, with their lands in the vicinity of Drezdenko. In 1797, seeking greater professional success, Wilhelm Karl Heinrich von der Osten-Driesen moved his family from Brandenburg Prussia to the Russian Empire, where he would receive his position as governor. It was in this period that, beginning in 1797, the young Driesen would establish himself in the Russian military. Accordingly, Driesen's military career began with his appointment to the position of ensign in the Preobrazhensky Regiment. It was in the earlier conflicts of the Napoleonic Wars that Driesen first distinguished himself, fighting at the battles of Austerlitz, Heilsberg, and Friedland. Consequently, in 1808 Driesen was promoted to the rank of colonel, while serving directly under Major General Alexander Tuchkov. By 1810, he was further promoted to the position of regimental chief of the Murom 21st Infantry Regiment. During the Patriotic War of 1812, Driesen served as an officer in the Third Infantry Corps, under Nikolay Tuchkov. However, Driesen's service on the battlefield would come to an end in September of that same year. He was wounded at the Battle of Borodino, losing a significant portion of his left leg. Driesen was, in turn, replaced by Major Andrey von Fitinhoff, and was from then on considered to have been a hero of the battle. Following his career during the Patriotic War, Driesen served in the Russian Empire's Ministry of War. After almost a decade as War Minister of Special Assignments, he was made a lieutenant general in 1826, and was appointed as military commandant of Riga in January 1828. Driesen continued a distinguished career in military service into his later years, and was promoted to the position of General of the Infantry in 1845. Driesen had five children: * Alexander (1824-1893) - Russian general, participant in the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-1878. * Vasily (1833-1903) * Nikolai (1837-1909) - General of the Infantry, participant in the suppression of the Polish uprising of 1863 * Paul (1842-1907) * Olga (1844-1913) - married Gustave Ye Struve Friedrich Wilhelm von Driesen died on 30 September 1851, in Riga.

History They were named after the novel by Ernest Hemingway as a comical reference to their shared name. The Hemingways were married in 1968 and impulsively began performing together playing traditional songs and covers in the venues of Cardiff. Anne's only experience of publicly singing before forming the band was in a school choir. Graham's guitar technique brought together classical playing with self-taught flamenco accents. Their style has been described as \\"mystical\\" and \\"acid-folk\\", their self-penned compositions being primarily about a fantasy world of mythological beings such as fairies, elves and dragons. They have been compared with the Incredible String Band and Tir-na-Nog. They toured extensively but recorded only one self-titled album, on The Village Thing label (VTS2) in 1970, produced by Ian A. Anderson, which has become highly sought-after as a collectors' item. The album featured supporting musicians John Turner (string bass, finger-picked and with a bow), and Andy Leggett (whistle on \\"Suddenly It's Evening\\"), both of the Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra.

It is the county top of the historic county of Lanarkshire, as well as the highest point in South Lanarkshire council area. It is the culmination of a network of ridges that lie south of the village of Coulter, close to the town of Biggar. It is probably most easily climbed from the north west. The best starting point is the mouth of Kings Beck, at NT 031305. Earlier OSGB topographic maps show a public road at this location, but the most recent maps show only a private road, and there are notices threatening to remove unauthorised vehicles. Cars should therefore be parked at Birthwood, 500 metres further back. It is tempting to walk up the track leading up the Kings Beck, but the direct route up the north west ridge is much easier. The slope is smooth and dry, the vegetation is short, and although there is no constructed footpath, helpful steps have been cut by the boots of previous climbers. There is an alternative starting point at Glenkirk, to the east (NT077295). From here, a circular route along a ridge including Chapelgill Hill is among several additional options. There is extensive sheep farming and sporting activity in the area, so care should be taken when accessing Culter Fell in the spring or late summer. From the summit, the view on a clear day stretches from the Cumbrian Lake District to the Scottish Highlands.

After the Nazi German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Maria Kotarba, a Catholic, witnessed the extermination of her Jewish neighbours near Gorlice, where she lived, and vowed to aid any Jew she could. Arriving at Auschwitz in the winter of 1943 she was allocated the prisoner number 27995, and after a range of camp duties, in the middle of 1943 was assigned to Kommando Gartnerei, the Gardening Commando labour squad.

Her reputation as a skilled courier traveled with her from Tarn√≥w. Maria was involved in smuggling food, medicine and messages from the outside resistance groups into the camp. =Friendships= In the camp, Kotarba met Lena Mankowska (n√©e Bankier), deported to the camp from the Jewish Ghetto in Bia≈Çystok. At registration, the prisoner-clerks registered Lena as a Polish political prisoner on account of her non-Jewish looks. The two women developed a deep and lasting friendship. Kotarba was aware of the other woman's perilous position and did all she could to help her as well as her sister, Guta, who arrived in Auschwitz from the concentration camp at Lublin-Majdanek with her friend Henia Trysk.

Despite being named \\"gardens\\" there is only one area divided by footpaths with an ironwork bandstand in the centre. Opened in 1814 with the Pump Rooms themselves, to begin with the gardens were only for the use of patrons of the Pump Rooms \\"to afford them pleasant promenades.\\" The original bandstand was later erected and bands played in the afternoon and evening during the summer (and other public holidays) for those paying to use the baths. During these early days the famed tightrope walker Charles Blondin crossed the area in July 1851. However in 1875 the gardens were opened to the public.Pump Room information from the official Leamington Spa website In 1881 plans were made to build the town hall on the gardens but at the last minute a change of site was agreed and it was built further north near The Regent Hotel. In 1893 a pedestrian bridge called York Bridge was built over the river. The second bandstand was designed by Walter MacFarlane & Co and founded in Glasgow. It was installed in 1896.Information on the bandstand from the Scottish Ironwork website Also the only remaining examples of the original Leamington cast iron gas lamps can be found alongside the south side of the gardens. The gardens originally contained decorative flower beds but with the decline in fortunes of the Pump Rooms themselves these have been grassed over. Bands still play in the bandstand, although very infrequently but the gardens host the annual Leamington Peace Festival, a fun fair once a year and farmers markets once a month. It is also a popular place for young people, especially those from the nearby Warwick University to sunbathe and play football. As it lies so close to the river it is part of the town that is most frequently flooded. The last two times such floods occurred were at Easter 1998 and in the summer of 2007.A good report on the causes and effects of the 1998 floodsA brief report of the Leamington flood of 2007 from the BBC In March 2012 new lights in iron arches (commonly known as the Linden Arches) were erected along the pathway furthest from the river. They were officially unveiled by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. This is the first major alteration to the park's superficial appearance since 1896. This was followed later in the decade when the bandstand was removed in autumn 2018 and returned re-furbished and painted different colours in spring 2019. The paths were slightly re-routed and totally re-paved and a new seating area with rock features and a small pond was constructed at the western end of the gardens. The ¬£1.4 million project also included new railings and new trees being planted.

Canada was not only a member but one of the principal initiators (founding countries) of the alliance.NATO: When Canada Really Mattered by Norman Hillmer in The Canadian Encyclopedia This Atlanticist outlook was a marked break with Canada's pre-war isolationism, and was the first peacetime alliance Canada had ever joined. However, Canadian officials such as Hume Wrong and Lester B. Pearson and including Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent worked in favour of the alliance not only because they sought to contain the Soviet Union, as did other members, but because they hoped the treaty would help to eliminate any potential rivalries between the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European great powers (principally at the time France, but later including West Germany), where Canada would be forced to choose sides. This had long been the overriding goal of Canadian foreign policy. The main Canadian contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty was Article 2 which committed members to maintain a \\"free\\" political system and to promote economic cooperation, in addition to the more usual diplomatic and military matters. However trans-Atlantic unity in political and economic matters has not come to fruition, as European states have looked toward the European Union and its antecedents while North America has the North American Free Trade Agreement In terms of military commitments, Canada originally stationed troops in Germany.Isabel Campbell, Unlikely Diplomats: The Canadian Brigade in Germany, 1951-64 (2013). During the 1950s Canada was one of the largest military spenders in the alliance and one of the few not receiving direct aid from the United States. The costs of maintaining forces in Europe combined with those defending its own vast territory and participation in the Korean War caused strain on the Canadian budget during the 1950s. Despite this Canada was not part of the inner sanctum of large countries that charted NATO policy. Canadian leaders grew disillusioned with the NATO alliance, and began to reduce Canada's commitment. In 1969 then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau withdrew half of Canada's forces in Europe, even as many leftist intellectuals and peace activists called for a complete withdrawal from NATO. With the success of the Canadian participation in the Suez Crisis, in Cyprus and on other UN peacekeeping missions, perception in Canada was that the forces had shifted from conventional warfighting to peacekeeping missions. Nevertheless, the bulk of Canada's military was focussed on the less-glamorous NATO mission in Germany, where there remained a brigade group and the bulk of an air division. In all, there were over 5,000 soldiers at any given time deployed in Germany until 1993, when the remaining Canadian troops were withdrawn from Europe by the government of Brian Mulroney following the end of the Cold War. Given the small size of Canada's military, the importance of Canada's contribution to NATO has primarily been political rather than military. However, during the 1999 Kosovo War Canadian CF-18 jets were actively involved in bombing Yugoslavia. Canadian troops were part of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, ISAF. In March 2011, the Canadian Forces participated in NATO-led missions in Libya, Angola.

History In 1876, Tai Hasegawa () established a medical school in Tokyo. At that time, the Japanese government and the Ministry of Education only permitted one medical school: the University of Tokyo School of Medicine. During the Meiji era, people who wanted to be medical doctors had to take an exam to receive a medical doctor's license. The Saisei Gakusha was a cram school to pass the exam. Many famous medical doctors, for example, Dr. Hideyo Noguchi and Yayoi Yoshioka (), graduated from the Saisei Gakusha, the predecessor of Nippon Medical School. The medical school was temporarily closed by the president of the school, Tai Hasegawa, in 1903. In 1904, the students and the faculties established the new Nippon Medical School. Kenzo Isobe () became the president of the school. Then, Masatsugu Yamane (), who was a member of House of Representatives, became its president and director. During the Taish≈ç era, the Ministry of Education eventually permitted the new medical school. Bombed Nippon Medical School in 1945 At that time, there were three big private medical schools in Japan‚ÄîKeio University School of Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine and Nippon Medical School. Keio University became a university in 1920. Jikei University School of Medicine became a university in 1921. And, Nippon Medical School became a university in 1926. With only three private medical schools as universities in that era, they were regarded as \\"Shiritsu Idai Gosanke\\", the big three. During the World War II, Nippon Medical School was damaged by air raids between 1944 and 1945. The main hall which had built in the Taish≈ç era was burned down in 1945. The first hospital of the Nippon Medical School which had built by the romanesque architecture style in the Taish≈ç era was recently bulldozed. Present Nippon Medical School is one of the most famous private medical schools in Japan. Its entrance exam is highly competitive. The medical research level of the school is high. Nippon Medical School is very popular in Japan. Many famous medical doctors graduate from Nippon Medical School. The medical school has four hospitals: the main hospital, the Chiba Hokuso Hospital, the Tamanagayama Hospital and the Musashi Kosugi Hospital. Including national universities, Nippon Medical School is a celebrated medical school in Japan. Nippon Medical School officially says that Kenzo Isobe is the founder.

He co- wrote the film script with Jun Kim over seven years, but shot the entire movie in less than a week at various locations in both New York and New Jersey. The film was produced for less than US$50,000. The 85-minute feature was inspired by the 1959 French classic Hiroshima Mon Amour directed by Alain Resnais and contains the classic show tune from the 1937 Rodgers and Hart musical Babes In Arms, Where Or When. Where Or When stars Mitchell Conwell, Shelly DeChristofaro, Jun Kim, and Carl Monego.  Synopsis  The film takes place on the eve of a nuclear holocaust, an event that the characters are unaware of. During this final day they must deal with anger, guilt, hatred, and love. All of this set to the backdrop of today's global issues.  Themes  Pour- Azar is able to film this event that portrays a scenario with horrible and unimaginable consequences by using the terrifying images from Hiroshima Mon Amour and contrasting them with the upbeat show tune Where or When.

The podcast originated as a radio show on KIRO-FM which aired from January 7, 2008 to September 11, 2009. Upon its radio broadcast cancellation, it immediately transitioned to a podcast on September 14, 2009, and is still produced Monday through Friday. Fans of the show are often referred to as \\"The Tens\\", stemming from an early radio episode where Luke would mention how they only have \\"tens\\" of listeners, rather than \\"hundreds\\" or \\"thousands\\". Format The show begins with the song \\"Catch My Disease\\" by Ben Lee, underneath a number of audio quotes from movies, TV shows or viral videos. Burbank welcomes listeners and outlines the upcoming show, followed by introducing his co-host and guests for the show. His current co-host/producer is fellow former KIRO radio host and veteran radio producer Andrew Walsh. Infrequently, former TBTL radio show producer Jennifer Andrews and engineer Sean DeTore will appear. In addition to the commentary of Burbank and Walsh on life, pop culture, and current events, the show features listener e-mails and voicemail, and closes with a music selection by the hosts. On Friday shows, the closing song is chosen by a listener. Radio show TBTL aired on 97.3 KIRO FM (and 710 KIRO AM before the station moved to FM) from 7:00 to 10:00 pm weeknights and at the same time on Saturdays for the \\"Best Of\\", which included clips from the past week's shows. The format was similar to that of the podcast, with Luke Burbank joined by Jennifer Andrews and Sean DeTore. TBTL was a non-caller driven program; listener phone calls were accepted on an infrequent basis. Instead on Wednesdays the shows had a \\"Call Makers\\" feature where listeners who previously sent in a phone number and question(s) were called and the question(s) discussed live on-air. News reports about the show characterized it as an attempt by KIRO, and its owner Bonneville International, to add a younger audience to KIRO's older listener base,Davila, Florangela (9 January 2008). \\"Luke Burbank is hip, vain, back in town and back on the air\\". Seattle Times. Retrieved on March 1, 2009. however, the Seattle Times noted that the show had only managed to draw 1.4 percent of 25- to 54-year-olds - the program's target sales demographic - who were listening to a radio at 7:00pm. While the program was Seattle Weekly's choice as \\"Best Radio Talk Show\\" in July 2009, after a poor showing in the Arbitron ratings, KIRO cancelled the program in September. Conversion to podcast While TBTL was an over-the-air ratings disappointment, it had attracted a national download following. In its final month of broadcasting, it had attracted more than 225,000 podcast download hours. The Stranger noted that \\"the younger listeners were, in fact, tuning in... they just weren't using the same equipment that KIRO's general audience uses.\\" Thus, when the radio program was cancelled, Burbank and KIRO announced that the program would continue as a daily podcast. On March 2, 2015, TBTL transitioned to Infinite Guest, American Public Media's Podcast Network. It continues to air under the APM Podcasts masthead.

He was rewarded for this crime with an appointment as baljuw of The Hague by Stadtholder William III. After a few years in this function he was arrested and convicted for gross abuse of his office. He was sentenced to death on November 26, 1680 by the Hof van Holland (the main court of law in the province of Holland), but appealed the verdict to the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (the supreme court of the Dutch Republic). He died in jail before this appeal was finished. Biography Van Banchem (alternately spelled Bancken) was born in The Hague, the son of Jan Gerritsz. van Banchem, a bailiff of the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (a namesake was the fourth president of this court, but in view of the father's patronym probably not the grandfather of Johan). He married Anna Deijm in 1649 and had several children from this marriage. He practiced law before the Hof van Holland (the main court of the province, the Hoge Raad being the federal supreme court) before he was co- opted into the Hague vroedschap in 1655. In 1672 he was elected a schepen of The Hague. He was known as an ardent Orangist and an enemy of the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt. =Murder of the De Witt brothers= The year 1672 is also known as the Year of Disaster in Dutch history, because through a concerted attack France, England, M√ºnster and Cologne had conquered a large part of the Republic and brought about the end of the First Stadtholderless Period. William III had been appointed Stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland in early July, and Johan de Witt had resigned his office of Grand Pensionary on August 4, after having been severely wounded in an assassination attempt. He and his brother Cornelis were held responsible for the dire straits of the Republic by the common people, who also resented his policy of trying to prevent the elevation of William to the stadtholderate. In mid-August Cornelis de Witt was falsely accused of a conspiracy to murder William. He was arrested and tortured, but refused to confess. He was then convicted of perjury because he denied knowing his accuser, a barber by the name of Tichelaar, and sentenced to banishment. The next day his brother Johan was lured to the jail, where Cornelis was recovering from the torture. When they were both in the jail the building was surrounded by the Hague civic militia, who were fiercely Orangist, because there were rumors that Cornelis would be allowed to escape. Now Van Banchem, in his official capacity of alderman, made the officers of the militia swear an oath that they would prevent the escape of the De Witts. He started to incite the mob that was milling about the jail. After a detachment of federal cavalry had conveniently been withdrawn, the militia led by Van Banchem, Tichelaar, and a silversmith by the name of Hendrik Verhoeff stormed the jail. The brothers were dragged from the building and shot by the militia. The bodies were then left to the depredations of the Mob. After this lynching, William, who probably was not in on the conspiracy to murder the De Witt brothers by van Banchem and the Rotterdam Regent Johan Kievit and his brother-in-law Cornelis Tromp (who had given the signal for the assault on the jail), nevertheless prevented attempts by the authorities to punish those responsible. He even rewarded them by doling out pensions (to Tichelaar) and high offices. Van Banchem was made baljuw of The Hague on September 20, 1672.Historisch Genootschap; see also (1986) John de Witt: Statesman of the \\"true Freedom\\" , Cambridge U.P., , pp. 217-222 =Career as baljuw= As baljuw (the equivalent of a Schout) Van Banchem was both public prosecutor and head of police. His office did not pay a formal salary, but he was allowed to retain certain fines levied, and could also negotiate transactions with suspects to avoid prosecution. This was all above board in itself. However, Van Banchem started to abuse his position by falsely imprisoning innocent people in his private jail (the official Hague jail was a federal institution and not under his jurisdiction), and holding them for ransom. He also blackmailed clients of Hague prostitutes, who were often employed by Van Banchem to engineer compromising situations. He was arrested in 1676 on multiple charges of extortion and false imprisonment. It is not unlikely that the attorney-general exacted some measure of revenge for the events of 1672 when he stringently prosecuted Van Banchem for crimes that were not unusual in those days. Van Banchem was even tortured. He was convicted and sentenced to death on November 26, 1680 by the Hof van Holland. However, Van Banchem appealed the conviction to the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland. While awaiting this appeal he managed to escape from jail in 1684. He fled to Amsterdam, where he tried to get the protection of burgomaster Coenraad van Beuningen. Van Beuningen, however, suspected him of plans to assassinate him and denounced him to the Amsterdam schout. Banchem was brought back to The Hague and now more securely locked up in the same jail where he had dragged the De Witt brothers from. Meanwhile, his appeal dragged on and he died in 1694, still in jail. He was buried in the Hague on October 4, 1694.Wagenaar and Van der Meij, op. cit References Sources * \\"Banchem, Van\\", in: (1906) Werken. Derde Serie No. 22.

It lies on the Mekong river. History The village of Kaoh Chbar originally consisted of five households living on a small island in the Mekong River.Kin, p. 2, 4. The name Kaoh Chbar, meaning \\"island with plants\\" in Khmer, was given because of the crops that residents planted on the island. From 1945 to 1953, the Khmer uprising against the French disrupted village life as villagers migrated between settlements to escape violence. Five households migrated from Kampong Kuy and Okreang to settle in Kaoh Chbar. In the years following Cambodia's independence, village life was challenging.Kin, p. 4. Villagers lacked food, and clothing was made from old sacks. Cholera and chicken pox were common. By 1962, Kaoh Chbar's population had grown to 38 households. With little space on the island, villagers resettled by the riverbank, where the village remains today. During the early 1970s, farming and fishing became impossible due to American bombing during Operation Menu, and villagers faced starvation. In 1975, Kaoh Chbar's population increased as Cambodians were forcibly resettled from towns and cities by the Khmer Rouge. Under the Khmer Rouge, labor was forced. Individual ownership was abolished, and all agricultural production belonged to the community. Villagers were moved from one village to another. In 1979, the village consisted of 30 households. During the early 1980s, Kaoh Chbar's population increased to 80 households. The water level of the river was high, and fish and wildlife were abundant. In the late 1980s, the village's population increased to 90 households. Land ownership reforms were important at this time. Geography Culture Economy and transportation The village economy is driven by sales of agricultural products and the use of natural resources. Subsistence fishing is also common. Richer families often possess agricultural land, tools, and draft animals to use in agriculture. They also sometimes transport resources such as timber and bamboo from nearby forests. Poorer families generally rely on selling labor for income because they lack the tools and draft animals necessary to exploit agricultural land. Daily wages as of 2002 averaged approximately 2,500-3,000 riel. These families may also hunt or gather resources such as vines or resin from the forest. Poorer families often face food shortages. There are five grocery stores in Koh Chbar. Villagers typically purchase food, clothing, and other goods in the village, because they rarely travel to the town market. Some businessmen come to the village to purchase livestock and timber, which is difficult to transport to the market in the nearby town. The road connecting Koh Chbar with outside towns becomes muddy and impassable in monsoon season, forcing villagers to travel to town by boat. Villagers generally travel in town by foot or by ox-cart; because the village road is poorly maintained, travel by bicycles or motorcycles is impossible. Demographics Governance Village and commune leaders, Buddhist elders, and a Village Development Committee (VDC) lead and organize Koh Chbar, though the village‚Äôs geographic size can make it difficult to manage. These authority figures are respected and reliable. Health, education, and development There is one school with three classrooms in Koh Chbar; it provides instruction through the third grade. To continue studying, children may become monks and study at the nearest pagoda, which is relatively far from the village. Most villagers are illiterate. The few people in the village who can read and write are generally older men who had studied at the pagoda. Villagers generally do not have access to medical services; illnesses are typically treated with traditional medicine. Though there are a few drug stores in the village, there is no quality control over drugs and there is no doctor in the village to prescribe drugs.

He was appointed by President William McKinley in 1901 as the 5th Governor of Oklahoma Territory. However, he had only served for six months when President Theodore Roosevelt removed him from office, after receiving complaints of political malfeasance. Although Jenkins was exonerated by subsequent investigations, his removal could not be undone, forcing his early retirement. Early life The son of Henry J. and Lydia (Miller) Jenkins, William Miller Jenkins was born at Alliance, Stark County, Ohio, on April 25, 1858. He attended public schools and then Mt. Union College at Alliance. He taught school in Stark County from 1876 until 1878. On December 21, 1878, Jenkins married Delphina White of Dublin, Indiana.Everett, Dianna. \\"Jenkins, William Miller (1856-1941).\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. Accessed March 4, 2018. Jenkins and his wife removed to Shelby County, Iowa, in 1880, where he was admitted to the bar in 1883. In 1884, he relocated to Arkansas City, Kansas, where he opened a private law practice. In 1888, he served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, where he was the first to cast a vote for William McKinley, who was running for the party's Presidential nomination. Governorship When the Cherokee Outlet was opened to settlement on September 16, 1893, causing a land-rush, Jenkins succeeded in securing a homestead in Kay County, where he practiced law until he entered government service. When President William McKinley appointed Cassius McDonald Barnes as Governor of Oklahoma Territory, he also appointed Jenkins to serve as the Territory's Secretary. Jenkins assumed that position in June 1897, and would serve for four years until President McKinley elevated him as Territorial Governor, effective May 13, 1901. In August 1901, a lottery was held to open the Comanche-Kiowa-Apache and the Wichita-Caddo Indian reservations for settlement. The governor was accused of collaborating with certain Interior Department officials in naming other officials to government positions in the counties that were formed from the two reservations. Questions of Governor Jenkins's fidelity arose following the renewal of contracts with the Oklahoma Sanitarium Company for the care of the insane in the Territory. Following the assassination of President McKinley on September 14, 1901, those questions developed into an outright opposition. Newly elevated President Theodore Roosevelt immediately received demands to remove Governor Jenkins from office. The Interior Department also examined the situation, and although the agency found no irregularities. Without affording the Governor an opportunity to defend himself, President Roosevelt summarily removed Jenkins from office on November 30, 1901. Territorial Secretary William C. Grimes became acting Governor until President Roosevelt appointed Thompson Benton Ferguson to the Governorship on December 9, 1901. The Territorial Legislature also investigated the claims against Jenkins in 1903-5 and exonerated him. Territorial Governor Ferguson would later report to the Secretary of the Interior Jenkins had \\"suffered a great injustice.\\" Late life and death Jenkins returned to his farm in Kay County, then lived for a few years in Guthrie, Oklahoma. Subsequent to his retirement, Governor Jenkins spent a few years in Utah. Upon returning to Oklahoma, he settled in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. In 1920, he was elected Court Clerk of Creek County, Oklahoma. He died at Sapulpa on October 19, 1941, and was buried in the South Heights Cemetery there.

He was born in Bologoye, Russia. His father was a railroad construction engineer and one of his grandfathers was a general. At the outbreak of the Russian Civil War (August 8, 1918) he enlisted in the dragoons of the White Army. Within a month he was wounded in action and was hospitalized until the end of January. During the war his regiment retreated across Siberia to the Far Eastern Republic. There he was discharged as an officer in April 1921. That year he crossed the Pacific to America. He was graduated from Whitman College in 1924, from the University of Oregon (M.A. 1925), and from the University of Minnesota (Ph.D. 1928). His thesis was one of the first to employ the modern form of quantum mechanics. It was supervised by John van Vleck, who later won a Nobel Prize. In 1938 he published Introductory Quantum Mechanics, one of the earliest textbooks on the subject. He taught at Washington University (1928-1930), Union College (1930-1955), and Harvey Mudd College (1965-1972). From 1955 to 1965 he worked in the aerospace industry, first at the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation and later at the Space Technology Laboratories of TRW.

This eight-sided building is also believed to be among only a few like it on Long Island and perhaps the only octagon-shaped hotel in the United States. History This eight-sided building was most famously known as the Octagon Hotel. It was built in 1851 for Luther Jackson and called Nassau House, and then the Acker Nassau House. It was a popular restaurant and political meeting place. A less festive meeting took place here in 1884, when the hotel was the site of the coroner‚Äôs inquest into the murder of three area women, Lydia and Annie Maybee of Wolver Hollow and Oyster Bay‚Äôs own Charlotte Aurelia Townsend. In 1887 Phillip and Mary Lavelle bought the business and renamed it the Octagon Hotel. When Phillip died Mary took over the operations and made many modern improvements which brought patrons from miles around. In 1889 she installed a central heating system which supplied year-round comfort to the guests of the hotel and in 1890 she built a generating plant which provided Oyster Bay‚Äôs first electrical lighting. Finding the new phone service offered by the Queens County Telephone and Telegraph Company unsatisfactory, she followed the example of nearby Snouder‚Äôs Drug Store and had her own direct phone line to New York City installed. Theodore Roosevelt's secretary maintained a one-room office believed to have been on the second floor in the Octagon Hotel during 1899. Roosevelt was elected governor in late 1898 and began serving his term in January 1899. The one-room office soon proved to be too small and the staff moved to larger quarters in the nearby Oyster Bay Bank Building.Interview with John E. Hammond, Oyster Bay Town Historian, October 31, 2008. In 1899 when Roosevelt was elected Governor of New York, his staff had their offices here in the Octagon Hotel. The busy nature of the hotel however became unsuitable and the governor‚Äôs staff moved to the Oyster Bay Bank Building on Audrey Avenue. The German Ambassador Baron Speck von Sternburg was the first foreign representative to be presented outside of the White House. When visiting Oyster Bay he took rooms in the Octagon Hotel during his visit.\\"Visiting Day at Oyster Bay\\", New York Times, August 4, 1903. The Secret Service were also reputed to have stayed at the Octagon Hotel, including in 1902 when \\"the hotel was overcrowded with Secret Service men, reporters, and politicians.\\"\\"President's Reception in Oyster Bay,\\" The New York Times, September 14, 1902. Mary Lavelle took the Octagon Hotel into the 20th century, but a new owner, Charles Davenport, saw his customer base decline as newer hotels in the village competed for clientele. After ten years, he sold the building to Edward Fisher, who turned it into Oyster Bay‚Äôs first Ford automobile dealership. It has been used for various automotive businesses ever since. It is the only known octagonal building in this part of Long Island. Present condition A proposal has emerged to restore the building to its original condition. This is being reviewed by the Town of Oyster Bay. Community groups have expressed their strong interest to see this building tied to the heritage of Theodore Roosevelt to be restored in a sensitive and thoughtful manner.

A dual citizen, he competed for Haiti at the 1996 Summer Olympics and for the United States at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Early life and career in Haiti Volmar was born in Miami, Florida on March 5, 1977, while his mother Yolette was visiting that city from her home in Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti. Shortly after his birth, he and his mother returned to Haiti, where they lived a prosperous life. Volmar's father was a land owner and small businessman; the family ran a home improvement store. His father was also a veteran of the Haitian military and a former driver for dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier. Volmar's parents divorced by the time he was thirteen. In 1990, after losing a fight at school, Volmar began taking self-defense lessons at the Union Judo Club in Cap-Ha√Øtien under the tutelage of Leandre Innocent. He was an apt student and earned a black belt after only two years. At age seventeen, his mother sent him to live with his aunts in the United States because of political turmoil in Haiti. Because he was born in the United States, he held U.S. citizenship and was able to travel there at a time when other Haitians were being denied visas. He began competing in the United States and internationally. Volmar competed for his home country, Haiti, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. He was Haiti's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Competing in the half-middleweight class (78 kg), he was given a bye in the first round and lost in the second round to Fl√°vio Canto of Brazil. Career in the United States While living with an aunt in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1998, Volmar received a letter from the Selective Service System notifying him that he must register with the system. Not yet fluent in English, he misunderstood and thought that he was obligated to serve in the military. After speaking with a recruiter who told him of the military's sports programs, Volmar enlisted in the United States Navy. His military service offered an excuse to ask the Haitian sport authorities for release, freeing him to compete for the United States. Volmar was trained as a combat medic and taught classes in self-defense at Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island. After work, he would drive ninety-eight miles to train at a judo club run by Jimmy Pedro in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Eventually, Volmar was admitted to the Navy's sports program and began competing again. He finished seventh at the January 2003 Kano Cup in Japan and was hoping to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics, until tearing two ligaments in his right knee at a training camp in Poland. He healed enough to compete at the Olympic trials, but failed to qualify for the summer games. He left the Navy as a petty officer at the end of his term of service in 2006. Volmar continued to train and participate in United States and international competitions. By January 2008, he was a member of the United States national judo team and was preparing for the 2008 Summer Olympic trials under coach German Velazco. Working out with teammate Anthony Turner that month, Volmar executed a throw which caused Turner to land on Volmar's left knee. With torn cartilage and two torn ligaments in his left knee, Volmar's chances to qualify for the Olympics were again in doubt. After surgery to repair the knee on February 5, he began vigorous rehabilitation to regain his strength. He started full training workouts two weeks before the June 13 trials and competed in El Salvador one week before the trials. Despite his injury, he was still expected to win the 100 kg (220 pound) weight class based on his performance throughout the previous year. At the Olympic trials in Las Vegas, Nevada, Volmar lost his first fight to Brian Picklo. Because of Volmar's long-standing number one ranking, a rematch was granted. The two would compete in a best-of-three series, with the winner earning a spot on the Olympic team. Volmar won the first match and Picklo won the second in overtime. The third fight also went to overtime and ended with a throw by Picklo which Volmar countered. Both opponents thought they had won the final point. After reviewing video of the move, officials decided that the winning point should go to Volmar. As winner of the best-of-three series, he qualified for the United States Olympic team. He competed in the Beijing games in the 100 kg (220 pound) weight class, but was knocked out in the first round after a loss to Amel Mekiƒá of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Volmar lives in Coral Springs, Florida, with his wife Crystal and their three children.

The effects studio was in operation from 1978 to 1981. The studio was created as a means for Universal to enter the visual effects field that was growing larger as well as provide in-house effects creation for Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Before the facility closed its doors in 1981 it had worked on four films, six television shows (two of which they did effects for the entire run of the show), several Universal Theme Park attractions, some commercials and a few specialty projects, including the special model effects for the Horizons attraction for Disney's Epcot Center and sequences for Disney's Captain EO 3-D attraction. History Universal Hartland started work on Universal's feature Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, in Douglas Trumbull's former \\"Future General Corporation\\" facilities in Marina Del Ray. In August 1978, they moved production to a newly created studio owned facility in North Hollywood and settled on Hartland Street (hence the name, \\"Universal Hartland\\"). This was around the same time that the Industrial Light & Magic crew started working on Battlestar Galactica. During episode two, Universal's management decided to move Battlestar Galactica to their Universal Hartland facility. For the next three years the studio created all of the visual effects for Buck Rogers and Battelstar Galactica. It would also work on The Concorde ...

Early life Zapata was born in Tambo Valley, Province of Islay in The Department Of Arequipa, Peru in 1926. His mother died when he was young, and grew up alone with a priest taking care of him. Very early on, he felt the need to study and pursue a career in teaching. He took his professional training in the Escuela Normal de Varones ‚ÄúSan Juan Bautista de La Salle‚Äù, Arequipa, where he graduated as an elementary school teacher. He was sent to a small town called Punta de Bomb√≥n, Arequipa. Coquito In Punta de Bomb√≥n he founded a First Grade School in 1952 that now bears his name. After 7 years of research, he developed Coquito - a method to teach children to read, write and think. He was about to name his book \\"sunset\\", or \\"evening\\", but he dreamed about a very funny and mischievous boy named \\"Coquito\\", and decided that that was the correct name for his book. CoquitoCoquito Cl√°sico was first published and sold in the city of Arequipa in 1955. The print runs remained small until the book started to be printed in Lima, in 1957, by Peruvian publisher Iberia S.A. The number of copies printed and sold grew steadily, and soon Coquito was being sold throughout Peru and in Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador. To date, over 35 million children in 12 countries ‚Äìin South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and Spain‚Äì have learned how to read by using the Coquito method. Zapata is also the author of more than 60 published teaching materials, for preschool and first-grade children, all distributed under the corporate brand name Ediciones Coquito.http://www.edicionescoquito.com Zapata says he is still looking for better ways to help children and teachers make the learning process easier. Family He has five children (four boys and one girl) and ten grandchildren. His youngest grandchild, a three-year-old girl, is currently learning how to read with \\"Coquito\\". Honors The Peruvian Department of Education has honored Zapata with the Palmas Magisteriales, its highest teaching award, with the topmost degree of \\"Amauta\\". Also, the Mayor of Arequipa awarded him the City‚Äôs Cultural Gold Medal, and he has been made Honorary Professor by The University of Santa Maria, a Roman Catholic university in Arequipa. He has also received a Gold Medal from the Arequipa Regional Government.

The Brick Gothic church continues in use as Doberan Minster (Doberaner M√ºnster). After the conversion to Christianity of the Wendish prince Pribislav, Doberan was the first monastery founded in Mecklenburg, in 1171, as a daughter house of Amelungsborn Abbey. The first community, at Althof, was massacred in 1179 in the unrest following the death of Pribislaw, and the abbey was re-founded in 1186 in Doberan. It quickly became a political, social and spiritual centre in the region. The abbey church, which continues in use as Doberan Minster (Doberaner M√ºnster), is one of the most important Brick Gothic buildings in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Until the Reformation, during which it was secularised in 1552, the abbey possessed great estates, and was the burial place of the Princes of Mecklenburg. The premises were badly damaged in 1637 during the Thirty Years' War, when the minster was used as a storage depot, and some buildings were destroyed. During the French occupation of Mecklenburg under Napoleon from 1806 to 1813 more damage was sustained, and the church was again used as an ammunition dump. Between 1883 and 1896 the church was \\"restored\\" in an inappropriate 19th century Gothic Revival style, which was undone in a further restoration in the 1960s and 1970s.

Principal aims The principal objectives of CAUT, as defined in its general by-law, are the following:: > * the defence of academic freedom, tenure, equality and human rights; * the > provision of collective bargaining services for the support and assistance > of member associations; * the conduct of federal lobbying and public > relations for academic staff and post-secondary education; * the collection > and analysis of data and the operation of a clearing house for information > pertaining to the social and economic well-being of academic staff and post- > secondary education; * the establishment and maintenance of international > relations with academic staff in other countries. History In November 1949, the Association of Teaching Staff of the University of Alberta first began exploring the idea of creating a national association of faculty to deal with issues of \\"salaries and pensions, sabbatical leave and academic freedom.\\" A poll of professors across the country found strong support for the initiative. When the Learned Societies, now Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences held their annual session in 1950 at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, an organizing committee was established and a decision was made to establish a national organization of university teachers.Michiel Horn, Academic Freedom in Canada: A History (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999), p. 212. also see http://acppu.ca/pages.asp?page=1021 Membership grew quickly. By 1957, CAUT represented about 78 percent of Canadian university teachers with 26 member associations and 3,400 full-time faculty. However, the organization struggled financially. It continued to operate without a national office and was staffed entirely by volunteers.Neil Tudiver, Universities for Sale (Toronto: James Lorimer and Company, 1999), p. 40. In 1958, CAUT was confronted with one of the most prominent academic freedom cases in Canada. The Board of Regents of Winnipeg's United College, a Presbyterian institution that is today the University of Winnipeg, dismissed Professor Harry S. Crowe for a letter he wrote to a colleague. The letter, obtained by the Principal of the college, was critical of the administration and made disparaging comments about the religious influence over the institution. CAUT was asked to investigate the matter and appointed a committee that included V.C. Fowke of the University of Saskatchewan and Bora Laskin of the University of Toronto. In its final report, the committee concluded that Crowe's dismissal violated due process, natural justice and academic freedom. The committee recommended that Crowe be reinstated. Following the release of the report, three of Crowe's colleagues stated they planned to resign unless Crowe was re-hired. The Board of Regents eventually agreed to reinstate Crowe, but refused to reconsider the three resignations. In protest, Crowe and 13 other professors left the college.Donald C. Savage and Christopher Holmes, \\"The CAUT, the Crowe Case, and the Development of the Idea of Academic Freedom in Canada,\\" CAUT Bulletin, 24, 3 (December, 1975), pp. 22-27. Even though Crowe and his colleagues lost their jobs, the case proved to be a seminal moment in CAUT's history. The time, effort, and expenditure demanded by the case demonstrated the need for a permanent office which was established in Ottawa in the fall of 1959. Stewart Reid, a colleague of Crowe's, was appointed the first secretary of CAUT. Reid oversaw the development of policy statements on governance, academic freedom and tenure, and throughout the 1960s CAUT focused much of its work on ensuring stronger protections for academic freedom.Horn, op. cit., pp. 244-245. In this early period, CAUT member associations were not trade unions. The unionization of Canadian academics did not begin until the 1970s. Pay and benefits had increased during the boom period of the 1960s when government funding increased and new universities and colleges were established. By the early 1970s, however, the tide had turned. The academic community was now facing a protracted period of restraint. Many academics argued that collective organizing was now needed to protect their pay and professional rights. Academic staff associations in Quebec were the first to certify as trade unions beginning in 1971 with L'Association des Ingenieurs Professeurs en Science Appliques de l'Universit√© de Sherbrooke. By 1975, more than 60 percent of academic staff in Quebec were unionized. In English Canada, 25 percent of professors were union members. CAUT increasingly encouraged member associations to certify, and by 1980 over 50 percent of faculty were unionized.Tudiver, op. cit., pp. 84-85. Today, the unionization rate of academic staff is approximately 79 percent, well above the average of 30 percent for all occupations in Canada.David Robinson, The Status of Higher Education Teaching Personnel in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States: Report Prepared for Education International , March 2006 In recent years, CAUT's membership has grown as part-time and contract academic staff have been organized. In addition, provincial college faculty associations from British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta have joined. Today, CAUT represents 86 associations with approximately 70,000 individual members. Academic freedom While collective bargaining occupies a much more central place in CAUT's operations today, the defense of academic freedom remains a core priority. According to the CAUT policy statement, the association defines academic freedom as follows: > Academic freedom includes the right, without restriction by prescribed > doctrine, to freedom of teaching and discussion; freedom in carrying out > research and disseminating and publishing the results thereof; freedom in > producing and performing creative works; freedom to engage in service to the > institution and the community; freedom to express freely one‚Äôs opinion about > the institution, its administration, or the system in which one works; > freedom from institutional censorship; freedom to acquire, preserve, and > provide access to documentary material in all formats; and freedom to > participate in professional and representative academic bodies. CAUT continues to investigate cases of alleged violations of academic freedom as in the Crowe case. Other notable investigations include the case of Nancy Olivieri,Jon Thompson, Jon, Patricia A. Baird, and Jocelyn Downie, \\"The Olivieri Case: Context and Significance ,\\" Ecclectica (Dec. 2005). David Healy (psychiatrist), and Tony Hall. Affiliations CAUT is a member of Education International, a global federation of education workers' trade unions.

UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Retrieved 22 February 2012.] Indigenous people make up about 42% of the population in Guatemala and mostly reside in poor rural areas with little access to post-primary education. Compared to non-indigenous students who average 5.7 years of schooling, Indigenous students are at a disadvantage with an average of 2.5 years of schooling. Indigenous students achieve lower than non-indigenous (ladino) students in schooling possibly due to greater poverty and lack of indigenous language involvement in public schooling. = Education resources and Indigenous disadvantage = Indigenous student achievement is lower than non-indigenous student achievement. Indigenous parents have less schooling and lower socioeconomic status contributing to a poor education environment: schools with fewer educational materials, poor school infrastructure, and low quality educators. Indigenous students across Guatemala start schooling about 0.5 years later than ladino students. Already with disadvantaged backgrounds, indigenous students attend schools with fewer resources and perform worse on exams than non-indigenous students across Guatemala. The recruitment and retaining of quality teachers poses a large problem in rural areas of Guatemala. Apart from the meagre pay, most teachers come from larger towns, where they have been able to receive higher education and, faced with a daily commute of a few hours to reach rural areas, many seek employment in the larger towns first. Indigenous students in rural schools therefore have lower teacher expectations which affects their achievement in school. The lack of curriculum guides or teaching materials in rural schools also hamper efforts to improve education standards in those areas. The current state of education in Guatemala is significantly under-funded. Many classrooms nationwide, especially in rural Guatemala, do not meet minimum standards for classroom space, teaching materials, classroom equipment and furniture, and water/sanitation.The Development of an Educational System in a Rural Guatemalan Community, Oscar H. Horst and Avril McLelland, Journal of Inter- American Studies, Vol. 10, No. 3 (July 1968), p. 478-479, published by the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Miami = School attendance = With more than half the population of Guatemalans living below the poverty line,CIA World Factbook, Guatemala\\".

Gorman and Ernesto Pollitt, International Review of Education, Vol. 38, No. 5 (Sep., 1992), p. 523, Springer This is exacerbated by the fact that, for poorer students, time spent in school could be time better spent working to sustain the family. It is especially hard for children living in rural areas to attend primary school. Most drop out due to the lack of access and largely inadequate facilities. Indigenous students drop out starting at age 12 which is the transition age between primary and secondary level schools mostly due to economic constraints and demand for labor work. For indigenous males, the need to work for financial stability is the most frequent case for dropping out or not enrolling in school. Indigenous students are more likely to work instead of or while attending school. Poverty is thus the main deterrent to schooling for indigenous students‚Äîpoverty and rural residence increases the likelihood of school incompletion and non enrollment. Gender inequality in education is common ‚Äî male literacy and school enrollment exceeds female rates in all aspects. Out of the 2 million children who do not attend school in Guatemala, the majority are indigenous girls living in rural areas. Most families subscribe to patriarchal traditions that tie women to a domestic role and the majority would rather send a son than a daughter to school if they could afford it.Education and Poverty in Guatemala, John Edwards, 2002. p. 23 and 30. Retrieved 22 February 2012. Mayan females are the least likely to enroll, start school late, and drop out the earliest compared to Mayan males and ladino males and females. Only 39% of indigenous females are literate compared to 68% of Mayan males, 87% Ladino males, and 77% Ladino women. Expectation of marriage and domestic duties for females, contributes to low investment in education‚Äîindigenous females marry younger than non-indigenous females and only 3% of married females enroll in school. Guatemala's spending on education is one of the lowest in the world. In 2007, the country spent less than 2 percent of its GDP on education, of which public primary schools received less than half. By the late 2000s, the majority of Guatemalan schools had grid- supplied electricity, allowing for the use of electrical lighting, heating, and computers and the provision of running water for drinking and sanitation. However compared to other countries in Latin America, Guatemalan schools score mid-pack on measures such as the supply of potable water, and near the bottom on others such as the number of bathrooms. Research has found that lack of infrastructure such as adequate potable water, sewage services, or electricity and lack of educational materials such as textbooks in Guatemalan schools can have significant negative impacts on student performance. Primary education has been compulsory in Guatemala since 1985, yet the populace has one of the lowest rates of cumulative education in Latin America. Educators in Guatemalan public schools often use teaching methods that do not account for the nearly 40% of students hailing from indigenous backgrounds who are non-native Spanish speakers. Monolingual Spanish instruction is used in linguistically diverse classrooms as there are about 20 Mayan languages in Guatemala. This is reflected in high rates of repetition of grades, for instance up to 30% in first grade. Compared to native Spanish speaking ladino students, Indigenous students often enter school without Spanish fluency and due to the language gap, achieve lower than other students. Research shows that bilingual education for indigenous students reduced grade repetition and dropout rates.  Historical Context  Guatemala‚Äôs Democratic Spring (1944-1954), was a period of social integration for Indigenous groups. In 1945 the democratic government of Guatemala established the instituto Indigenista Nacional (IIN) allowing children in schools to learn to read in their native language first before learning Spanish. After a short democratic period, Guatemala suffered 36 years (1960-1996) of civil unrest, referred to as the Conflicto Armado or ‚Äúarmed conflict.‚Äù Learning in native indigenous languages was no longer allowed after 1965 when the Education Law declared Spanish as the official language of Guatemala educational instruction. The shift from a democratic to an authoritarian state caused guerrilla movements to emerge and a civil war to break leading to the indiscriminate massacre of many indigenous groups across Guatemala creating systemic inequalities for the indigenous, particularly in politics and education. = Peace Accords = The Peace Accords of 1996, an agreement between the Guatemalan government and civilian groups under the United Nations, ended the 36 year armed conflict and ‚Äúacknowledged the role of the educational sector in perpetuating racism via unequal access to schools, poor treatment of indigenous students, and discriminatory representations of indigenous culture in curricula‚Äù (Bellino, 65). The Peace Accords laid out steps to achieving education equality by increasing access to schooling, promoting bilingual instruction, encouraging community involvement, reforming school curriculum, and establishing decentralizing institutions. A main objective of the Peace Accords was to increase schooling for rural and indigenous people and decentralize the education system, but many demands of the Peace Accords remain unfulfilled. There has not been an official introduction of indigenous languages to the education sector and inequalities between indigenous versus non indigenous groups remain. Demands in the Peace Accords are as follows: * Intercultural and bilingual education will exist in every school * Policies will recognize and strengthen Mayan identity and increase their access to education by incorporating indigenous pedagogical values in teaching. * Government will fund implementation * Females will have equal access to education To counteract low levels of school funding, remittances to Guatemala from family members working abroad are often used for educational purposes such as school uniforms, home computers, and internet access. Remittances are also used to provide regular meals, electricity, and sanitation in the home, which enhance children‚Äôs ability to access education. Families can also use remittances to hire labor, allowing children to stay in school rather than be pulled out to assist with farm work or domestic activities like caring for siblings. In some cases, successful migration has paradoxically given rise to ‚Äúbrain waste,‚Äù in which male children especially view school as a waste of time because they plan on also migrating for work as soon as they are able in their teenage years. This outlook is reflected in findings showing that education is not highly valued in rural areas of Guatemala. = PRONADE = In attempts to reform the country's education system, particularly its rural schools, the Guatemalan government created the PRONADE (National Community-Managed Program for Educational Development), and PROESCOLAR (Education Development Program) initiatives in the 1990s to give communities more say in local school affairs. Together with the parents of students, these programs administered thousands of rural public and quasi- charter schools in the late 1990s and early 2000s, governing teacher hiring, monitoring teacher and student attendance, facilitating school food programs, and maintaining facilities. PRONADE schools are located primarily in rural indigenous areas to increase access to schooling and improve the quality of education in rural Guatemala. Each community is represented by a Comite Educativo de Autogestion Educativa (COEDUCA) made up of parents and community members. PRONADE is successful in improving parent and community participation in schools and has expanded access to educational opportunities in rural areas.  Critiques and Challenges  PRONADE is not institutionalized by the Ministry of Education so it is not considered equivalent to traditional schooling. Teachers have provisional status and experience inconsistent salaries as it is determined by the community so several are unsatisfied. They are also not trained in intercultural and bilingual education which is a demand of the Peace Accords and which affects student achievement. PRONADE has increased access to education but repetition, non-enrollment, and dropout rates remain high. PRONADE schools are self-managed schools that require voluntary parent and community management which is not always feasible for communities where PRONADE exists that are of the poorest and need to work. Insufficient finances force parents to invest in textbooks, teacher salaries, bills, etc from their own money which puts an additional financial burden on them. PRONADE is a low cost to the government but a high cost to communities which influences the quality of education that students receive. Some critics believe that PRONADE, a top-down approach, fails to address the educational inequalities of poor indigenous people and rather perpetuates extreme poverty in rural Guatemala.

Snouder's Drug Store was the oldest operating business in Oyster Bay, New York. The store was first established in 1884. The first telephone in Oyster Bay was installed here, and for several years it remained the only one in town. When Theodore Roosevelt became Governor of New York State and later President, the press corps gathered at Snouder's to transmit news from Oyster Bay. Phone service and the soda fountain installed in 1889 made Snouder's one of the most popular gathering places in town. In the 1990s the exterior was returned to its original color, which was determined through paint chip analysis. The building is a Town of Oyster Bay Landmark and was a featured site on the Oyster Bay History Walk audio walking tour. History It is uncertain how early the first building was erected on this site but evidence exists that dating it back to the late 17th century. Snouder's Drug Store, located here since 1884, was the oldest continuously operated business in Oyster Bay. The drug store was established by Abel Miller Conklin whose descendants were the founders of Miller Place in Suffolk County. Conklin had been a druggist in York City, but moved to the countryside of Oyster Bay in 1880 on the advice of his doctor, who felt the fresh air would improve his health. His first drugstore there was somewhere along South Street, though the exact location is not known. In 1884 he relocated the drug store to its final location, and carried on his business with the help of his son-in-law, Andrew Snouder. Andrew had left the clothing and shoe business to aid his ailing father-in-law. Despite the move, Abel Conklin‚Äôs health did not recover. He soon died, leaving Andrew Snouder to carry on whilst initially keeping the name Conklin‚Äôs Drug Store. In 1887 he installed a telephone, the very first in Oyster Bay, which for several years remained the only one in town. Until Theodore Roosevelt became president even Sagamore Hill did not have a telephone and for several years Mr. Snouder relayed messages for the future president. The phone service became a key reason people gathered at Snouder's. In May, 1900 Andrew Snouder partitioned a part of the store for the exclusive use of telephone service. This enabled the switchboard operated by Miss Ellen Ludlam to remain open until the drugstore had closed late at night. That same year Andrew graduated second in his class from the New York College of Pharmacy and officially changed the name of the business to Snouder's Drug Store. The telephone also brought many members of the press to the booths of Snouder's Drug Store, covering news of Theodore Roosevelt, both as Governor and President. Teenagers and children congregated here as well, both for the telephone service and the delicious refreshments after Mr. Snouder had a soda fountain installed in 1889. This soda fountain became a center of social life for several generations of kids, into the 1970s. In the 1990s the exterior was returned to its original color, which was determined through paint chip analysis. After many decades Snouder's shut its doors in December, 2010.

It was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1994. The site contains the remains of the first Spanish capital of the island, settled in 1508 and abandoned in 1521. It represents the oldest known European settlement on United States territory. The site is on the grounds of the Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico (Museo de la Conquista y Colonizaci√≤n), which features artifacts from the site and other archaeological sites in Puerto Rico. History In 1508, Juan Ponce de Le√≥n founded the original Spanish settlement in Puerto Rico at Caparra (named after the province of C√°ceres, Spain, the birthplace of then-governor of Spain's Caribbean territories Nicol√°s de Ovando),\\"Guaynabo -- Encyclop√¶dia Britannica\\" (with history of Puerto Rico),Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2006, Britannica.com webpage:EB-Guaynabo-Puerto-Rico:names: Caparra, the first Spanish settlement in Puerto Rico (1508). which today is known as the Pueblo Viejo barrio of Guaynabo, just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. But the air was not wholesome and the mendicant friars insisted on moving the settlement closer to the bay and to the sea. They complained that the infants were dying. Their preferred area was that of the Islet of Puerto Rico (\\"rich port\\" or \\"good port\\"), because of its similar geographical features to the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. It was not until the end of Ponce de Le√≥n's tenure as governor that they had their wish. By 1521, the move was complete and it was known as \\"Villa de Puerto Rico.\\" With time the name of the island, San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico, traded places with what is now the capital of Puerto Rico: San Juan. According to Floyd, \\"Ponce built the only stone house in the village, which for years functioned additionally as the Casa de Contratacion, the archive, and the arsenal.\\" It became his permanent home, where he was joined by his family in 1509. Archaeological history The Caparra Site was first identified as important during a survey in 1936, as part of a program to develop tourist facilities on the island. Preliminary excavations spearheaded by Puerto Rico's fifth official historian, Adolfo de Hostos, in 1936 and 1937, identified a large tapia structure, bisected by a two-lane highway, that matched de Le√≥n's description of his own residence, the only non-wooden structure in the settlement. Further excavation identified the main plaza and the sites of other buildings. The property was acquired by the Puerto Rican government in 1948, which relocated the northern section of the house ruins in order to widen the road. The roadway was again widened in 1963, destroying the southern portion of the structure excavated in 1936. The museum was established in 1958; the site continues to be examined by archaeologists.  In folklore  A story from 1530 says that two Spanish men, Diego Ramos de Orozco and Diego Guilarte de Salazar, were living in Caparra and searching for gold in Puerto Rico's rivers, for Spain. They each had at their disposal 40 Ta√≠no slaves. Good friends, they elaborated a plan to travel to a hard to reach, secret place in order to excavate and find gold for themselves and their own fortunes. Immediately upon finding a large piece of gold that they had originally agreed to share, their friendship was tested. In conniving to keep the gold, Orozco used fake dice, but then suffered a bad fall. Days later, when his friend Guilarte finally returned with help, Orozco lay dying, and confessed to having used fake dice and asked his friend for forgiveness. Sierra de Orozco, a mountain located in the Cordillera Central is named after Orozco.

Writers in this vein (notably Gary Watson and Diep Tran) are in particular interested in the relationship between a person‚Äôs social standing and the type of education that is received at school. In its most basic form the principle states that the social relations of the school can be directly related to those in the work-place, meaning that educational institutions prepare students for their future work roles. Apart from the formal curriculum that is offered by the school, the advocates of the correspondence principle argue that the structure of the school and also the personal experience given to each student (the hidden curriculum) is important to their future socialization. They also emphasize that there is a strong relationship between the child‚Äôs education and the interaction they have with their parents at home. There is a significant inter generational replication of consciousness and socialized inequality via the linkages among the authority relations experienced by fathers at work, transferred to child-rearing styles, and replicated in school interaction with teachers. Relationship to conflict theory The correspondence principle is broadly aligned with the conflict theory approach to sociology, which originated with Karl Marx. Marx's said that there is a social class division in capitalist society, between on the one hand a small percentage of the population who are capitalists, owning the means of production, and on the other workers, who sell their labor power to the capitalists. The correspondence principle advances a neo-Marxist argument about the specific nature of the institutional linkages in the family, school, and work \\"chain\\" comprising the socio- economic life cycle. Many sociologists who support this principle argue that education is just a means of maintaining social class boundaries. Many argue that schools in capitalistic societies are geared toward giving children different types of education based solely on their social standing rather than by their inherent skills. Under this principle schools are believed to give lower class children a different type of education compared to their upper class counterparts. Typically, it is said that lower class children are put on an educational track that will prepare them for blue collar jobs. It is thought that the education of lower class children is different because it prepares them to enter the work force directly after high school. Schooling teaches working class children to sit quietly at their desk, obey the teacher‚Äôs authority, and also acquaints them with becoming familiar with repetitive tasks. Similarly, the education of upper class children is thought to be geared toward upper class or white collar professions. With upper class children, instead of focusing on preparing them to enter the workforce, there is added emphasis is on preparing them to move on to four year colleges and universities after high school. Here they are trained to be professionals and capitalists by teaching them how to think critically and instilling in them a sense of responsibility and authority.

Bethany also performs the songs in American Sign Language, an aspect of their live performances praised by Tucson Weekly. This element was added at Adrienne's suggestion after seeing Bethany sign Tori Amos songs at home. At local shows, Mrs. Sneed would serve cakes and host party games. The TunaHelpers toured the U.S and Canada sharing the stages with such as Nina Hagen, TeamDresch, The Aisler Set, The Dresden Dolls, Faun Fables, Lydia Lunch, The Frogs, Adam Green, Lesbians on Ecstasy, Gretchen Phillips, Electrelane, and Bettie Serveert. The band also performed SXSW showcases four years in a row. Origins and lineup changes The band was an outgrowth of Adrienne's desire to expand her solo act, which was originally called Adrienne and the TunaHelpers, and featured Adrienne with two fish puppets, Sushie and the Bad Cheese and Hootie Blow My Fish, who sat in front of homemade instruments. After Bethany joined, the act became Adrienne, Bethany, and the TunaHelpers. The name was shortened upon Quinones's joining. Meshbane, a friend of Adrienne, also joined the band, but stayed with it only about a year. By their second album, Meshbane had amically departed and received a special thanks credit, Timb Harris performing violin, viola, and cello on the second album, though not credited as a full band member. The nautical theme continued with the band members' album credits as Adrienne the Anemone, Bethany the Barracuda, and Khattie the Katfish. Guest musicians (\\"Tuna Helper Helpers\\") on the first album included Nick Smith \\"(the nice eel)\\" on trombone, and Kurtis D. Machler on bass, and the second album featured choral overdubs by Nicole Aurora and string and choral arrangements by Trey Spruance. Smith also directed the band's music videos. Difficulty with the name Although the band never liked the name, but were unable to come up with something they liked better, on November 4, 2003 the band received an e-mail threat from attorney for General Mills proclaiming that their name was a trademark infringement on Tuna Helper. After consulting with attorneys, Adrienne responded with a flippant reply. She had previously had a restraining order put against her after taping feces to the door of an old boyfriend, which became the basis of the eponymous song. Recordings Their first album, starring in... The Suspicious Fish, was released in 2002 by Monkeyboy Records. \\"Vanity Girl\\" of Citizen Snob found that the music lost little more than Bethany's sign language when stripped away from the stage show. She described it as \\"akin to watching children play--equal parts innocence, malice, curiosity, fear, and bravado,\\" and said that as much on album as live they would remain one of her favorite bands. Shannon Lavine of The Propagander said \\"they incorporate current subject matter with old- fashioned folklore\\" and \\"Let them play for your two year old on her birthday\\", while several reviewers noted the prurience of \\"Bicycle\\", including The Austin Chronicle. The album is not, as the title may indicate, a rock opera or concept album, as it has no overarching narrative or continuity; however, as the Chronicle put it, \\"The Tuna Helpers have crafted their own vague mythology revolving around tuna and other sea creatures (along with all the double- entendres that may apply), but their treatment of it is too sophisticated to come across as pure schtick. Which isn't to say it's not super-fun.\\" The album also contains a performance of Stephen Foster's \\"Old Folks at Home\\" including a surrealistic interlude written by the band fraught with food metaphors and imagery from the Easter story. Adrienne handed a press kit to Trey Spruance at a SXSW Festival and invited him to an unofficial women's rock showcase. Although both Sneeds were ill at this performance requiring Quinones to emcee, which none of the members were happy with, Spruance loved the show, and a month later e-mailed that they were in the Web of Mimcry. The band's second album, I'll Have What She's Having, was released on March 15, 2005. Spruance flew to Austin to record the band, and Adrienne flew to Spruance's home in Santa Cruz for album production. The new label got them into stores throughout North America, Europe, And Australia. Writing of the second album, Anna Breshears of Bitch describes their live shows as being full of puppetry and stage effects, described Sneed as having \\"operatic range and precision,\\" but also being capable of \\"whittl[ing] her voice down to a warble of petulant protestations\\", and describes Quinones's drumming as \\"expressive.\\" She contrasts their work with teenage gothic music, describing it as \\"smarter, prettier and ha[ving] a sense of humor.\\" Dead Earnest called the album \\"unique, accessible, original, quality and close to brilliance...\\" and \\"a rare gem.\\" Anna Maria Stj√§rnell of Collected Sounds Women in Music said she was \\"so impressed I'm at loss for words.\\" Matt Wake in The Huntsville Times described their music as \\"something akin to nursery rhymes on acid.\\" Reception Reviewers frequently favorably compared the band with Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Throwing Muses, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Roches, and Rasputina. Adrienne acknowled Bush as an influence in Indianapolis's Nuvo Newsweekly, and cited other influences as P. J. Harvey, Pat Benatar, and Heart. In the same interview, she also stated that she appreciated that her audience would sit and listen to her shows without making much noise. Matt Wake of The Huntsville Times called her act Ziggy Stardust by way of The Muppet Show. Tim Burton's name was invoked by numerous reviewers for comparison, as well. Dissolution The band gave its final concert on February 14, 2007, and Adrienne Anemone, having dropped the article from her stage name, moved to Brooklyn, New York, pursuing a solo career (performing both band and non-band songs, as well as \\"Old Folks at Home\\") in the New York City area folk music and LGBT communities, as well as creating performance art in the New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. areas. Bethany Sneed is now studying to be a Deaf-education teacher, while Khattie Quinones and Stacy Meshbane both continue to perform with local bands. Discography =starring in...

The series was a production of 20th Century Fox Television, and the final credit of each episode stated: \\"Filmed by Twentieth Century Fox Television Inc. at its Hollywood studios and in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong\\". Synopsis Hong Kong was set in the then British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. Taylor portrayed Glenn Evans, a U.S. journalist who worked in the exotic Far Eastern city. His search for stories led him into encounters with smugglers, murderers, drug peddlers, and mysterious women who would disappear behind beaded curtains. Taylor‚Äôs principal costars were Lloyd Bochner, who portrayed Chief Inspector Neil Campbell, and Jack Kruschen as Tully the bartender. In the television series, Evans' residential address is often given as the fictitious 24 Peak Rd. As shown in various episodes, the interior of Evans' bachelor apartment (actually a Hollywood set constructed on a sound stage at 20th Century Fox Studios) includes a large, sliding-glass door which opens to a small patio with a sweeping vista that overlooks the harbor and distant peaks. Evans' regular drive was a white Series 1 Sunbeam Alpine. Hong Kong was loosely based on the film Soldier of Fortune, which had Michael Rennie in a police inspector role similar to Lloyd Bochner's. Kruschen appeared in the film as well, in a role different from the one he played in the series. The series premiered on Wednesday, September 28, 1960, and ceased new episodes on March 29, 1961; repeats continued until September 27. Hong Kong ran opposite NBC‚Äôs Wagon Train, when midway in the season Ward Bond died in Dallas, and his trail boss character, Seth Adams, was succeeded without explanation by John McIntire as Chris Hale. CBS at the hour offered the short-lived The Aquanauts, renamed at mid-season as Malibu Run.

He also turned out for Durham in the Minor Counties Championship between 1912 and 1914. After his retirement from playing, he stood in 21 games as an umpire, all in 1921. Early career Harry made his first-class debut for Lancashire against Gloucestershire at Aigburth at the end of July 1903. The game was badly affected by rain and was drawn; Harry did not bat, and his only wicket was that of Frank Thomas. He played a handful more games during the following two seasons, but failed to set the cricketing world on fire. Prime 1906 was a completely different story, and indeed it was to prove a far more successful season for Harry. He scored a career-best 767 runs at 20.18, including three half-centuries, the highest of these (and of his career) being the 88 he hit against Worcestershire in June. However, the highlight of his batting season came at Blackpool at the end of the summer, when in Lancashire's game against an England XI, he hit an unbeaten 64 in the second innings to guide the county to a tie.At the time, not all second- innings wickets had to have fallen for a game to be considered tied. With the ball Harry also enjoyed success in 1906. Without doubt his finest hour came against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in May. In a low-scoring match (which was over inside two days) he claimed 6/26 in the first innings, following it up with 9/44 in the second. This remained his career best, as did his match figures of 15/70. He managed five-wicket hauls on two other occasions, and finished the summer with 87 wickets (another career best) at an average of 19.63. In 1907, Harry was similarly successful with the ball, picking up 84 wickets at 16.58, taking five in an innings on no fewer than eight occasions; this time his best return was at Eastbourne, where he achieved a superb first- innings analysis of 29.4‚Äì16‚Äì26‚Äì7; none of the other four bowlers in that innings managed an economy rate of under two. However, he played much less in 1908 and took only 31 wickets, and after that season played no more for Lancashire. Later playing career and umpiring Indeed, despite the aforementioned short spell with Durham between 1912 and 1914, Harry did not appear in first-class cricket again until after the First World War. When cricket resumed in 1919, he was with a new county, Worcestershire, but he did not find success there. He played only eight times for his new side, and his best innings figures were just 3/60, achieved against Somerset at Worcester in July 1919. After three unsuccessful games in 1920, Harry's first-class playing career was at an end. He stood for one season as an umpire, and died a few years later at the early age of 48.

Ferson began his big league career on May 4, 1889. That year, he went 17-17 with a 3.90 ERA in 36 games (34 starts, 28 complete games). Despite finishing 10th in the league in hits allowed (319), ninth in the league in losses and eighth in the league in hit batsmen, he was still the best pitcher on the team overall. Although the team finished last in the league with a 41-83 record (.331 winning percentage), Ferson managed a winning percentage of exactly .500. Furthermore, he was the only pitcher on the team with at least one decision to finish with a winning percentage of .500 or better (in contrast, George Haddock went 11-19 for a .367 winning percentage, George Keefe went 8-18 for a .308 winning percentage, Hank O'Day went 2-10 for a .167 winning percentage and Egyptian Healy went 1-11 for a .083 winning percentage). Ferson also had the best ERA of any pitcher with at least two appearances, and he made the most appearances, games started, and he pitched the most innings. The rest of Ferson's career didn't really pan out for him. In fact, for the Bisons in 1890, he went 1-7 with a 5.45 ERA in 10 starts. For the Orioles in 1892, he went 0-1 in 2 games (1 start), posting an ERA of 11.00. He played his final game on July 25, 1892. Overall, Ferson went 18-25 in his three-year career, posting an ERA of 4.37. He made 48 appearances, starting 45 of them, completing 36 of his starts and shutting out one of his complete games. According to the Similarity Scores at Baseball-Reference.com, Ferson is most similar statistically to Rick Matula and Parke Swartzel. A poor hitter, Ferson hit .133 in 150 career at-bats.

History The NSA PC was founded as the U.S. Navy Mine Countermeasures Station on 20 July 1945, as a result of the transfer of the test station from Solomons, Maryland, but was renamed ca. 1955 to the U.S. Navy Mine Defense Laboratory. In 1972, it was renamed the Naval Coastal Systems Laboratory which changed to Naval Coastal Systems Center in 1981. The base has been a subsidiary of several other commands in the past including Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division, and Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, under which it was designated Naval Surface Warfare Center: Coastal Systems Station. It obtained its current name in 2007 after changing from the prior command structure to the tenant command structure used by the Navy today in its command of research and development centers.

Early life She was born in 1821 in Plymouth, Massachusetts to Ichabod Morton, a prominent anti-slavery worker. She had five brothers and was the only daughter. One of her ancestors was George Morton, a Plymouth Pilgrim. As a young girl, Diaz was the secretary of a juvenile anti-slavery society, to whose funds each member aimed to contribute twenty-five cents weekly, which was a large sum at the time. To raise half her contribution she went without butter and knit garters. She was influence by anti-slavery leaders William Lloyd Garrison and Horace Mann. For a time, the family lived in the Brook Farm communal experiment in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, her father built a house there and in the 1840s, she was a teacher there. When it was clear that the community would not be a success, the Mortons returned to Plymouth. Early adulthood She married, but it was a brief marriage that resulted in two sons. To support them, she taught at public and private schools, was a housekeeper at an island resort near Plymouth, and \\"put out\\" garments for a large clothing manufacturer. When visiting the \\"lofts\\" she saw that there were skillful women who worked there at little pay because they had no other options. Career =Women's Educational and Industrial Union= She was a founder of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union of Boston. An important work of that association was giving legal protection of helpless women and girls from employers and advertisers who did not pay fair wages. She was unanimously re- elected president of the educational and industrial association every year since its organization. =Writer and lecturer= In 1861, Diaz sent a story to Atlantic Monthly, under an assumed name, and received a check for forty dollars for it. Her stories for children, originally published in Young Folks and other magazines, have a wide fame, and series after series, beginning with William Henry's Letters to His Grandmother, Pink and Blue, The Little Country Girl, Farmer Hill's Diary, The Schoolmaster's Story and Some Account of the Early Life of a Bachelor. When Rev. Edward Eggleston became editor of \\"Hearth and Home,\\" he was advised by William Dean Howells to write to Diaz, and he did so, the correspondence resulting in the series of papers upon the household life of women found in The Schoolmaster's Trunk. These and others are included in two volumes, The Bybury Book and Domestic Problems. Her letters and articles on household and domestic difficulties caused her to be looked upon as one speaking with authority, and she was invited to lecture upon those questions. She read a paper in the Woman's Congress held in Philadelphia in 1876. The paper was entitled \\"The Development of Character in Schools,\\" since published in the Arena. Personal life Diaz, a profound believer in Christian Science, wrote several pamphlets on the subject. At the end of the 19th century, she gave lecturers on the ethics of nationalism, Christian socialism, progressive morality, life, meaning of life, developing character in homes and schools, human nature, competition, and a series of papers on arbitration, first published in the Independent. Diaz lived in her home in Belmont, Massachusetts, with her oldest son.

He was a middle child of Count William VI and Marguerite de Turenne. Two of his elder brothers, Wulgrin III and William VII, became Counts of Angoul√™me in succession after the death of their father in 1179. Aymer succeeded his brother in 1186, and soon after was at the court of Richard the Lionheart, then Duke of Aquitaine and thus Aymer's lord, to receive recognition of his accession. By 1188, Aymer had married Alice of Courtenay, the daughter of Peter I of Courtenay and thus granddaughter of King Louis VI of France. In that year, Alice gave birth to a daughter, Isabella of Angoul√™me, who married King John of England in 1200. The marriage alliance was sealed by two treaties, one public, the other private between Aymer and John. The count remained a steady ally of the kings of England against the rebellious House of Lusignan. Aymer had a claim to the County of La Marche, where in 1199 or 1200 he was exercising authority, perhaps on behalf of his son-in-law, and issued a charter to some monks of Aubignac. In February 1202 when John was visiting Angoul√™me to negotiate a treaty with Sancho VII of Navarre, Aymer took him on a tour of the newly consecrated abbey church at La Couronne. The role of Aymer's daughter in John's continued refusal to properly care for his brother Richard the Lionheart's widow, Berengaria of Navarre, may explain the Count of Angoul√™me's proximity to the negotiations between the two kingdoms. Aymer died in Limoges on 16 June 1202. His daughter and only child succeeded him as Countess of Angoul√™me. Her title, however, was largely empty since her husband denied her control of her inheritance as well as her marriage dowry and dower. John's appointed governor, Bartholomew de Le Puy (de Podio), ran most of the administrative affairs of Angoul√™me until John's death in 1216. In 1217 Isabella returned and seized her inheritance from Bartholomew, who appealed unsuccessfully to the English king for help. Aymer's widow, Alice, ruled the city of Angoul√™me until March 1203, when John summoned her to court and granted her a monthly pension of 50 livres d'Anjou in return for her dower rights. She thereafter retired from public life to her estate at La Fert√©- Gaucher, where she was living as late as July 1215, when she issued a charter at Provins using the title Countess of Angoul√™me.

Over the years, New Zealand has gone through many iterations of censorship legislation. What began in the 1850s as vague and weak legislation was repeatedly updated with each iteration of censorship legislation addressing perceived shortcomings of the previous legislation. Notable changes in New Zealand censorship legislation include the continued attempts to give an objective criterion for determining whether something should be censored and the establishment of a centralized body that handles most censorship matters. These iterations adapted New Zealand legislation to changing times, and moved censorship in New Zealand in a more liberal direction. The Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) is the government agency that is currently responsible for classification of all films, videos, publications, and some video games in New Zealand. It was created by the aforementioned Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 and is an independent Crown entity. The head of the OFLC is called the Chief Censor, maintaining a title that has described the government officer in charge of censorship in New Zealand since 1916.  Censorship legislation: 1850 - present  = Early acts = The Obscene Publications Act of 1857 was one of the earliest censorious acts in New Zealand. Aimed at \\"works written with the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and of nature calculated to shock the common feeling of decency in any well regulated mind\\", it laid out a process by which obscene works could be destroyed, but did not explicitly define what could be considered an obscene work under law. This was followed by Vagrant Act of 1866 and the Police Offences Act of 1884, which both lightly contributed to censorship legislation. Both of these acts focused on banning the display of obscene media in public, but did not give much precision to the definition of \\"obscene\\". The later Offensive Publications Act of 1892 was passed to formalize some of the legal procedure surrounding such cases, but the act contained major loopholes that made it difficult to actually prosecute someone under it. This act was in part targeted at reducing the spread of advertisements for fraudulent medical practices, which had become common by the 1880s. Early censorship was enforced by allowing postmasters to open and dispose of mail that they thought contained material in need of censorship. This power was given to them by the Post Office Acts Amendment Act of 1893. = Indecent Publications Act of 1910 = The Indecent Publications Act of 1910 was one of New Zealand's earlier pieces of legislation regarding censorship, and remained in effect until it was repealed in 1963 by the Indecent Publications Act of 1963. Its aim was in part to shore up some of the weaknesses of the aforementioned 1892 act. Notably, the act allowed for more aggressive law enforcement when it came to searching for and seizing indecent material and introduced a set of guidelines for determining whether something was indecent or not. That said, it did not explicitly define the term \\"indecent\\" and the Hicklin Rule was often applied by courts evaluating censorship cases. A centralized censoring body did not exist at the time of this act's passing, and a good amount of censorship during the lifespan of this act was done by the minister of customs. Due to a close relationship between the Customs Act of 1913 and the Indecent Publications Act of 1910, the controller of the custom departments was able to seize material that they considered to be indecent \\"within the meaning of the Indecent Publications Act\\", effectively censoring it. Notably, Forever Amber was censored by this method. Beginning in 1945, the censorship method put in place by the aforementioned interaction between the Customs Act and the Indecent Publications Act began to draw concern from the public and from groups like the New Zealand Library Association that had a particular stake in censorship. The main concerns were with the suitability of the people who passed judgement on whether a book would be censored or not and with the absence of clear, objective criteria or guidelines for determining whether something should be censored or not. This public furor was in part triggered due to the somewhat arbitrary censorship of the aforementioned Forever Amber. In response to this concern, a committee led by Ian Gordon was established in 1953 to review and provide advice on whether a book should be censored. However, this committee had very little power, and it was not mandatory to consult the committee or to listen to its recommendations. Eventually, the customs department of the time stopped consulting this committee entirely. In 1960 the novel Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov was banned by the Supreme Court under this act. This decision was made based on an interpretation of the clause \\"unduly emphasizing matters of sex\\" as meaning \\"dealing with matters of sex in a manner which offends against the standards of the community in which the article is published\\". Eventually, the book was judged to be indecent on the basis that it \\"would have a tendency to corrupt or deprave a class of readers not negligible in number\\", despite its literary merit. = Indecent Publications Act of 1963 = The passage of the Indecent Publications Act of 1963 in response to a report from a Ministerial Committee of Inquiry into Pornography in 1987 brought with it great changes to censorship in New Zealand. The act was designed to react to the problems of the prior act and notably moved the responsibility for classifying books and sound recordings from the court to a committee of experts. However, the classification of other forms of media, including photographs, remained the jurisdiction of the courts. The act also sought to correct the drawbacks of the old evaluation procedure by formulating a more objective criterion, ensuring that a book was evaluated by experts, defining \\"indecent\\" in stronger terms, and allowing for a range of judgement beyond just \\"decent\\" and \\"indecent\\". Furthermore, the act allowed for the re- submission of books or other media, and in doing so allowed New Zealand censors to adapt to changing times. The aforementioned committee of experts was known as the Indecent Publications Tribunal, and acted as the main censoring body for New Zealand until the act was replaced by the Film Publications and Videos Act 1993. The committee consisted of five members, and at least two members were required to have significant expertise in the fields of literature of education. Beginning in March 1964, this tribunal was responsible for examining books and audio media and classifying them based on the criteria outlined in the act. The Indecent Publications Tribunal was, however, not all powerful and could only rule on publications that had first been submitted to it. The Indecent Publications Tribunal was notably responsible for the reclassification of the book Lolita in 1964 as 'not indecent', thus allowing for the legal purchase of the book. The decision to overturn the judgement made under the 1910 act was made in consideration of the new definition of \\"indecent\\" in the 1963 act, under which the literary merit of the work was to be considered in the tribunal's decision. This judgement ultimately passed with 3 assenting members and 1 dissenting member who viewed the book as perverse and of no exceptional merit. This dissenting voice came from Judge A. P. Blair, the then chair of the tribunal, who called for the book to be restricted to those over the age of 18. While this act centralized censorship to an extent, the Customs department still played a large role in enforcing censorship. Much like they could under the 1910 act, the custom department was still able to seize material that it considered offensive. These seizures were only contestable if disputed, in which case the matter would be referred to the Indecent Publications Tribunal. This act was notably criticized by the Society for Promotion of Community Standards (SPCS), which was founded by conservative Catholic pro-censorship activist Patricia Bartlett in 1971. The SPCS took issue with some of the more liberal decisions of the Indecent Publications Tribunal and opposed most sexual content. Their activism aided the passage of an amendment bill in 1972 that introduced some controversial changes. = Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986 = After parliament passed the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, New Zealand censorship regulatory bodies could not rely on previous case law and tribunal decisions based on the illegality of gay male sex. Later that same year, in Howley v Lawrence Publishing, the Court of Appeal found that censorship regulators should base their decisions on social scientific and medical research.Reported as Collector of Customs v Lawrence Publishing Co Ltd [1986] 1 NZLR 404 During the eighties and nineties, an increasingly proactive LGBT New Zealand community fought several test cases that expanded Howley's precedent to encompass all government censorship regulatory bodies. The Society for Promotion of Community Standards lost all of these cases, whether before the Indecent Publications Tribunal, High Court, Court of Appeal or the later Office of Film and Literature Classification. Today, most lesbian and gay erotic media that contains sexual imagery is labelled R18, available only to those eighteen years of age and over. While fetishist erotic media is similarly regulated, any media that depicts paedophilia, necrophilia, zoophilia, coprophilia, urophilia, or drug manufacture information is prohibited in New Zealand. = Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 = The passage of the Film Publications and Videos Act 1993 merged the previously separate Indecent Publications Tribunal, Chief Film Censor and Video Recordings Authority into a single agency, the New Zealand Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC). This agency presides over censorship in New Zealand to this day. In addition to the OFLC, a Film and Literature Board of Review, made up of 9 experts, was established as the agency that presides over the appeals process for decisions made by the OFLC. The Board of Review handles appeals made within 28 working days of the original decisions. Any later appeals must be made at least three years from the original decision and are evaluated by the OFLC itself. Under this act, films, videos, DVDs, and video games have to go through the OFLC for classification and labeling while books, magazine, music, and newspapers are only processed when a complaint it raised about them by a third party. While it was always mandatory for film to have a physical label displaying its classification, similar rules for print media were not put into place until 2005, where an amendment to the act required that print media given a classification of 'restricted' have a physical label denoting this classification. The OFLC receives very few classification requests for printed media in the modern era, with only 25 items being classified in 2007.  Censorship by medium  = Film censorship = The advent of film as a commonly consumed form of media brought with it a strong push for legislation that would be able to regulate film. The period between 1909 and 1915 saw requests for film regulation come from many different sources, and these culminated in the Cinematograph Film Censorship Act of 1916. This act introduced a national film censor, who was given full jurisdiction over film censorship, and who aimed to censor media in order to \\"protect the public mind, especially children, against things that may do them harm. This act remained in place until 1928, when it was replaced by the Cinematographic Film Censorship Act of 1928. This act combined the previous act with several amendments, consolidating all of them into one new piece of legislation. Notably, this act included a letter grade system of classification and the extension of the film censors power to encompass advertising material for films. This letter grade system was expanded upon by chief film censor Gordon Miriams, who introduced a set of restrictive labels in 1950. Under these acts, the chief film censor was given full discretion when it came to censoring films, and was able to arbitrarily cut and approve films based on the particular film censors beliefs. Particularly telling are the criticisms of Douglas McIntosh, chief censor between 1970 and 1974, whose critics contested that \\"the law allowed him to do anything he liked\\" when it came to censorship. This remained the case until 1976 when the Cinematograph Films Act was passed. This act removed this discretionary ability and stated that a film must only be censored if it was \\"injurious to the public good\\". The act defined some criteria to use when considering whether a film would be injurious to the public good and, in doing so, provided for a more objective system of film censorship. After the passage of the Film Publications and Videos Act 1993, film censorship is, like all other censorship, currently governed by the OFLC. It has been reported that diplomats from China have twice called upon the Auckland University of Technology to suppress film screenings that were critical of the Chinese government. AUT declined in both cases, although an event commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests was unable to proceed due to a conflict with the Queen's Official Birthday holiday. = Theater = Theater does not appear to be a medium that was actively censored and there seem to be relatively few instances of attempted theater censorship in New Zealand. = Internet censorship = New Zealand actively monitors and censors its citizens usage of the internet. Since 2010, New Zealand has engaged in the filtering of web requests to any site on a non-public blacklist. This filtering only applies if the user received internet service from an internet service provider who has elected to participate in the filtering. = Video games = Video games in New Zealand are censored under the 1993 censorship act. They are evaluated by the OFLC under the same criteria as all publications. In addition, some degree of self censorship has been practiced by the NZ video game industry. Notably in 2003, the video game Manhunt became the first game to be banned by the OFLC. The extremely graphic nature of the game led the OFLC to consider it injurious to the public good, and garnered the game a classification of 'objectionable'. In particular, the OFLC pointed out that the game rewarded players for particularly brutal killings and forcing the player to kill to progress the story over a non-trivial length of time.Office of Film & Literature Classification New Zealand (2003) 'OFLC No. 302023 Reasons for Decision.' https://www.classificationoffice.govt.nz/find- ratings. Retrieved 28 November 2018. Following Manhunt, several more games have been banned.  Notable cases  = 1900 - 2000 = 1922 saw New Zealand experience its first and, as of 2006, last attempt to prosecute someone for blasphemy. John Glover was brought to trial in 1922 for the inclusion of the poem Stand To: Good Friday Morning, by Siegfried Sassoon, in a 1921 issue of The Maoriland Worker. This prosecution was brought forth due to the belief that the last 3 lines of the aforementioned poem contained blasphemous libel, due to supposedly indecent use of religious imagery. John Glover was found not guilty by the jury, but it was noted in a rider that \\"similar publications of such literature be discouraged\\". The film All Quiet on the Western Front was banned in New Zealand as anti-war propaganda in 1930. It was eventually allowed to be shown with a few cuts made. The \\"Censorship and Publicity Regulations\\" was passed in 1939 and used to prevent the dissemination of information deemed contrary to the national interest during World War II. For example, the newspaper of the Communist Party of New Zealand, The People's Voice, was seized in 1940. The Battle of Manners Street in 1943 was a riot involving American and New Zealand servicemen. No report of the event was permitted in local newspapers. During the 1951 Waterfront dispute, it was illegal to publish material in support of the watersiders or their allies. The film Ulysses, based on the James Joyce novel, was rated R18 in 1967 and only screened to segregated audiences because it uses the word 'fuck'. The \\"segregated audience\\" ruling was lifted in 1972, but still rated R18. = 2000 - present = In 2000 a complaint was made against two Christian videos that represented homosexuals and bisexuals as \\"inferior\\". The case was upheld. Family First New Zealand have called for the banning of violent video games, most notably Grand Theft Auto IV, among others. The film Baise-moi, which contained violence and real rather than simulated sex by the actors, was the subject of a number of complaints laid by the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards. After an extended classification and appeal process, the film was ultimately classified in 2003 by the Court of Appeal as R18 and restricted to theatrical exhibition or exhibition to participants in tertiary media or film studies courses. T-shirts have been censored in New Zealand, and in 2007 one that advertised an album for Cradle of Filth, a British extreme metal band, was banned by Bill Hastings, the chief censor in New Zealand. According to Hastings, it was one of the most graphic T-shirts he had ever seen. The shirt displayed an image of a mostly nude Roman Catholic nun masturbating, along with the text \\"Jesus is a Cunt\\". In 2008 The Peaceful Pill Handbook, a book explaining how to carry out euthanasia, was initially banned by the OFLC since it was deemed objectionable. In May 2008, an edited version of the book was allowed for sale if sealed and an indication of the censorship classification was displayed. Philip Nitschke, its author, had deleted content that might have directly assisted the suicide of others, which is an offence under New Zealand's Crimes Act 1961. In 2014, the 2010 Queenstown suppressed indecency case gave rise to a discussion over the use of suppression orders protecting celebrities when a member of the New Zealand Parliament, Maggie Barry, described a groping by Australian entertainer and convicted sex abuser Rolf Harris during a studio interview she conducted in her previous broadcasting career. Retired parliamentarian Rodney Hide taunted her in a newspaper column, urging her to use her parliamentary privilege to breach the name suppression order. Following a complaint from Family First New Zealand and the Society for Promotion of Community Standards, the book Into the River was placed under an interim restriction order in 2015 under the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act 1993, banning it from being sold or supplied until classification for it had been finalised. This decision was met with national and international criticism and scrutiny, and the restriction order was eventually lifted in late 2015 after significant back and forth between the OFLC and the Board of Review. Into the River was initially given an M rating in 2013, and went through reclassification many times before the interim restriction order was placed and raised in 2015. The book is currently unrestricted. In 2019, Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported that Chief Censor David Shanks banned the distribution of the Christchurch mosque shooter's publication, saying that \\"others have referred to the publication as a 'manifesto'\\", but Shanks considers it a 'crude booklet' which promotes murder and terrorism. RNZ wrote that \\"those who have the publication for legitimate purposes, such as reporters, researchers and academics to analyse and educate can apply for an exception\\" but that \\"according to the Department of Internal Affairs, 'knowingly' possessing or sharing objectionable material carries up to a 14 year jail term\\". In response to the shooting, Minister of Justice Andrew Little initiated a review of existing hate speech laws with the goal of making them broader. In October 2019, the Department of Internal Affairs banned the downloading and distribution of the alleged German shooter Stephan Balliet's livestream of the Halle synagogue shooting. The Chief Censor David Shanks likened the video's content to the Christchurch shootings.  Chief Censor  The Chief Censor is the Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Office of Film and Literature Classification. Bill Hastings was the Chief Censor from 1999 through to 2010 when he stood down to become a District Court Judge and Chair of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. Deputy Chief Censor Nicola McCully filled the role until Dr Andrew Jack was appointed to the position for a three-year term starting in March 2011. *William Jolliffe 1916‚Äì27 *W A Tanner 1927‚Äì1937 *W A von Keisenberg 1938‚Äì1949 *Gordon Mirams 1949‚Äì1959 *Douglas McIntosh 1960‚Äì1976 *Bernard Tunnicliffe 1977‚Äì1983 *Arthur Everard 1984‚Äì1990 *Jane Wrightson 1991‚Äì1993 *Kathryn Paterson 1994‚Äì1998 *Bill Hastings 1999‚Äì2010 *Andrew Jack 2011‚Äì2017 *David Shanks 2017‚Äìpresent See also * Internet censorship in New Zealand References Further reading * External links *The Office of Film & Literature Classification *Searchable database of censored material *Censorship Compliance at the Department of Internal Affairs ","title":"Censorship in New Zealand"},{"id":"18100990","text":"Sundance Beach is a summer village in Alberta, Canada.

Sri Chaitanyananda Natha Saraswathi (or Aiya, as they call him) is the peetathipathy of the temple along with Gnanamba (or Amma,) his wife. Aiya is a disciple of Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswathi who is the Peetathipathy of the Devipuram temple. The temple was founded in Zambia, then moved to the Aiya's home in Rush in New York state before the current, purpose-built temple was constructed. The temple and its community have been the subject of an in-depth study by Corrine Dempsey.  Guru Lineage  The Guru Lineage starts off with Dakshinamurthy (a teacher form of Shiva) who gave the knowledge to Balatripurasundari, who gave it to Dattatreya, and the lineage continued down until it eventually branched out to Srilasri Swaprakasananda Theertha Avadhootha, who gave it to Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswathi, who on Friday, Oct. 5, 1979 gave initiation to Sri Chaitanyananda Natha Saraswathi (Aiya).  Sri Chaitanyananda Natha Saraswathi (Aiya)  The ninth and last child of Sri. Sinnayya Pillai Navaratnam and Smt. Kamalambal, Sri Wijayaharan (Aiya) was born into a family of Devi upasakas. Worship of the Mother had been continuing in his father's family for more than six generations, but was abruptly halted in 1918 after the sudden demise of Sri Wijayaharan's paternal aunt. Sri Haran learnt of the tradition at the age of ten, from his father. The young Haran wanted to revive the rich tradition of Devi worship in his family. The Devi's Blessings were with him the moment the desire to worship the Mother took form in his young heart. After having graduated from the famous Jaffna College, Sri Haran received Shadakshara mantra dhiksha from the late Srilasri Sivasachithananda Mathaji, a paramahamsa sanyasini, the disciple of Srilasri Sivananda Saraswathi. He imbibed knowledge of the ritualistic practices under the tutelage of Sri Mataji and her disciple Srimati Selvanayaki Kalyanasundaram at the Sivananda Tapovanam in Thirukoneswaram. Aiya emigrated to Zambia to work as an architect for the Government in Lusaka. In this small town, he met a few South Indian families and was touched by the true devotion for the divine that he found in them. The families assembled regularly for Satya Sai bhajans and Friday bhajans and the Haran family decided to commence regular Puja with the ever-growing circle of devotees and so, in 1976, regular chanting of the Lalita Sahasranama was started. It was in Lusaka that Aiya met his present Guru, Srilasri Amritananda Saraswathi (Dr. N.P. Sastry) from Andhra Pradesh. He was overwhelmed by the compassionate eyes and depth of feeling he felt when he was first introduced to Sri Amritananda. He noticed Sri Amritananda performing the dashamudras during the recitation of the Lalita Sahasranama and decided to ask him for initiation into Sri Vidya. Sri Wijayaharan was showered with the grace and the priceless mantra on the Poornima day, Friday, Oct. 5, 1979. Sri Amritananda performed an eight-hour Navavarana puja at Aiya's house and initiated Aiya and his wife Srimati Sakuntala with the mantras. Aiya was then taught the intricacies of performing the various aspects of the mahayagna called the Navavarana puja. Aiya moved to the United States in 1980. Named the \\"Kanchi Peetam\\" at first, the Peetam now known as the Sri Rajarajeswari Peetam was established in his own house. Worship of the Devi has been continuing at the Peetam and waves of devotees started to flock to Here. In the early part of 1981, during the morning puja, Aiya experienced Poornabhishekam by the Devi Herself and was given the dhiksha name of Sri Chaitanyananda. His wife Srimati Sakuntala was named Gnanamba. In that same year, during the Navaratri celebrations on the seventh evening, the Devi left an impression of a conch in Sri Chaitanyananda's right palm. And in 1984, Sri Chaitanyananda received the call to compile a comprehensive text on the intricacies of the Navavarana puja. Having tirelessly worked on this book for an entire year, the first edition was offered to Her lotus feet during the Sharada Navaratri.  Sri Gnanamba (Amma)  Amma is the eldest daughter of Sattanathar Kumarasamy and Rajammah. Born in a village Thambachettyponpeedro in Eezham, she is the eldest of nine children. She was initiated into the Shiva Panchaksharam by Shiva Sachidananda Mataji in 1963 when she was studying in Ramanathan college in Chunnakam. She married Aiya in 1970 at Kadhirgamam in Ceylon and accompanied Aiya to Zambia in 1971. Amma was initiated into Sri Vidya by Guruji on October 5, 1979. She received Purna Diksha along with Aiya and was named Gnanamba by the Devi. In her ancestry is one of the greatest Tamil luminaries - \\"Sadhavadhani\\" Kadhirvel Pillai, a person who could concentrate on one hundred different things at the same instant. He is well known for his literary works, especially his commentary on Tiruvacakam, which has no equal to date. Amma plays the supporting role of an upasaka to the hilt and she teaches by example. Sri Chaitanyananda and Gnanamba have opened their hearts, home and the Peetam to all devotees who hail from every part of the world. Aiya's love for Tamil literature, Carnatic music and vedic incantations flows out through the unique style of worship that he has developed. The Sri Rajarajeswari Peetam has mothered more than 100 affiliated Peetams all over the world.  Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswathi (Guruji)  Sri Amritananda Natha SaraswathiSri Amritananda Natha Saraswathi (Dr.N. Prahalada Sastry) was born in Visakhapatnam, the first child of Sri Narasimha Rao and Srimati Lakshminarasamma. Guruji, as he is referred to, started his spiritual quest at a very young age. Blessed with divine experiences early in his childhood, his young mind was teeming with questions, searching for the truth. The stage was set for his spiritual inclination that was to intensify later in life. In the course of time, his interest turned to science. He graduated from the Andhra University with a masters in Nuclear physics and received his doctorate from the University of Bombay, while working at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Guruji spent 23 years at TIFR, involved in research. In the final years there, he was working on a defense project for the air defense. But his spiritually inclined conscience was not comfortable with the destructive nature of his research. In the meantime, in 1977, Guruji visited the Balaji temple in Hyderabad. He went in and prostrated before the Lord. He felt an extreme thrill pass through his body; and Guruji had his first initiation from Balaji, that is Balatripurasundari. This proved to be the turning point in his life. After deep thought, he decided to look into the spiritual aspects a little deeper and devote time to work for the upliftment of society. He received SriVidya Poorna Dhiksha from Sri Swaprakashananda Natha Thirtha Avadhutha of Anakapalli. And he was showered with the Grace of Devi Saraswathi and given the dhiksha name of Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswathi. Involved in defense research at TIFR, his mind was in search of the truth within himself. It was at this juncture that he was offered a position of Professor of Physics at the University of Zambia in Zambia. Realising that this was an opportunity to take a fresh look at one's self, he accepted a two-year contract to work in Zambia. It was there that Guruji met his \\"spiritual son\\", Sri Wijayaharan and accepted him as his disciple, in SriVidya upasana. Guruji returned to India in 1981. He resigned from TIFR and settled down in Visakhapatnam, into SriVidya upasana and worship of the Devi. He slowly started working on means to help improve the standard of living of his fellow men. In 1983, during Devi yagna, Guruji was approached by the brothers of the Putrevu family, with a request to build a temple for the divine Mother. In addition to the of land that they had donated, Guruji bought the adjoining and it was registered as land for the Devi temple. Having acquired the land, Guruji was looking for divine guidance, a sign of approval to commence construction of the temple.The Devipuram Mahameru temple In the vicinity of the donated land, there was a small hillock where Guruji would often spend time in meditation. On the slopes of the hillock, he noticed a formation very similar to that of the Kamakhya Peetam in Assam. One day, while in meditation he experienced himself lying on the Peetam, while four others were performing a homam with the flames emanating from his body. And during purnahuthi, he felt a heavy object being placed on his heart. Awakening from his meditative state, Guruji was prompted to dig that site. Unearthed from that very spot, he found a Sri Chakra MahaMeru made of panchauloha. It was later discovered that a huge yagna had been performed in that area more than 250 years ago. Guruji had visions of the Devi as a sixteen-year-old girl. With her blessings, he built the Kamakhya Peetam on the hillock and a Siva temple on the peak, in 1984. Construction of the Sri Meru Nilaya in Devipuram was started in 1985. Built covering an area of , the temple has three levels and stands tall. The temple has the idols of all the Devis described in the Devi Khadgamala stotra. The temple construction was completed in 1994 and the kumbhabhishekam celebrated with great pomp and piety. This temple is unique in allowing the devotees to perform puja to the Devi themselves, without distinction of caste or creed.  Srilasri Swaprakasananda Theertha Avadhootha (Gurugaru)  Fondly known to his disciples as Gurugaru, Swami Srilasri Swaprakasananda theertha avadhootha was born in 1915 in a small village, Vidurbarthi in Andhra Pradesh. Hailing from the Dattatreya lineage, Sri Swaprakasananda had not received any formal education, yet with the Mother's Blessings, has vast knowledge of the Vedas and Sastras and is well versed in Sanskrit. Sri Gurugaru came in contact with some of India's finest spiritual gurus during his twentieth year. He received Dhiksha from Sri Poornananda Yogi, a disciple of the Tibetan guru, Maru Maharishi. He was introduced to SriVidya upasana by Sri Kesari Kameswara Rao of the Madhvacharya sampradaya. In his 32nd year, Sri Gurugaru received Dhiksha in the mahavidyas of Sri Rajarajeswari, Vanadurga and Saptasathi Chandi. He attained Poorna dhiksha from Sri Gnanananda Saraswathi of Anakapalli. He travelled the length and breadth of India to enhance his spiritual knowledge. By the time he was 40 years old, he had mastered the 64 tantras, from Orissa and Rajamandri. At 43, he had learnt 70 million mantras from the teachings of 18 peetams and many gurus. He spent a few years in Kasi contemplating and analysing the source of the mantras he had learnt. He was greatly aided by Sri Dakshinamurthi Paramahamsa of Lalithanagar, Visakhapatnam. In addition to the siddhis he had already received, he became a vedic scholar at the age of 58 with the grace of Chintamani Mahavidyeswari. By 1980, in his 65th year, Sri Gurugaru felt the urge to renounce the material world and take up sanyasi. To this end, he travelled to the Sri Bhadrakali Mahapeetam at Haridhwar's Saptarishi sarovar. Sanyasa dhiksha was showered on him by Srilasri Kalyanananda Bharathi theertha Maharaj. Years later, with his Guru's blessings, Sri Gurugaru took up the Avadhootha Ashram. Sri Gurugaru attained Maha Samathy on Gurupoornima day year 2002.

It was formed by Dave Newton, a musician and student who had just moved to Boston from New York City to attend The Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University downtown on Beacon Hill. The band played original very fast-upbeat punk/new wave music, with heavy repeating melodic hooks and strong 3-part harmonies. Gigs The band usually played twice a week, almost always on weekends, at local clubs that included: The Fire Escape in the South End, Passim's in Harvard Square (now Club Passim), Super Richard's on Boylston Street at the southwest corner of Boston Common, Spit behind Fenway Park, 10 Lansdowne Street also behind Fenway Park, Metro (also behind Fenway Park), Storyville in Kenmore Square, The Rat in Kenmore Square (a traditional Rathskeller), Titan's in Allston, and Lanny's Garden in Brighton). The band was also booked regularly as the \\"local opening act\\" for regional and national bands appearing in concert in Boston (primarily through Jim Julian Concerts, and Jimmy Jay Productions). They opened for artists such as Daniel Amos Band, Randy Stonehill, Denny Correll, The 77s, Fireworks, and Sheila Walsh. Members and history Members included Dave Newton (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Steve Jenks (bass and backing vocals), Mark Tuner (drums), Jeff Bailey (lead guitar and backing vocals). The band started with Newton as a solo artist (guitar and vocals) playing his original songs near the Park Street MBTA station in the Boston Common. Jim Julian, a local concert promoter and disc jockey at both AM-1090 WILD and AM-590 WEZE radio stations, heard Newton his second day playing in the Common, approached him, and booked him on the spot into local clubs as a solo act and opening act for local bands. Bob Klein (then editor of now defunct Lacrosse magazine In The Crease) introduced Newton to Jeff Bailey (a substitute teacher at Newton North High School, where Klein headed up Young Life). Newton and Bailey played twice as a duo (two guitars with two-part harmonies) when they were approached by Steve Jenks after their second gig at The Crater in Somerville, MA (near Tufts University). That same week, four phone calls came in from Newton's hand- written ad posted at The Berklee School of Music looking for a drummer, the fourth call being Mark Tuner (a copier salesman in the main Boston office of Savin). The band had its first practice the next Saturday in the small garage behind the house where Newton was renting a room in Watertown, MA. The band perfected a super tight 13-song set of original music, plus three punk-new wave cover versions of: \\"Show Me The Way\\" (Peter Frampton), \\"Badlands\\" (Bruce Springsteen), and \\"Runaway\\" (Del Shannon). Original song set The band's original songs were always played in the same music-set order: # Matter of Time # No Way # I Know That I've Seen # I Will Show You # Too Much Tension # Questions # Flashbacks # (Don't Use) My Name That Way # Get Out Now # The Wedding Downtown # Taking In The Sun # Let It All Go # Trust in You. The self- named Transformatix 7\\" vinyl two-sided extended single was recorded on an RCA 8-track reel-to-reel system in the basement of Paul McGowen in Cambridge, MA (he was a grad student at MIT and also worked at the Boston Phoenix newspaper) and featured \\"Let It All Go\\" on the 'A'-side and \\"Trust In You\\" on the 'B' flip-side. Exactly 60 copies were pressed at Harper's Music on Long Island, NY and shipped C.O.D. to Newton's room in Watertown. Thirty of these were mailed out to various record producers, agents, and talent scouts. Some were sold at two Boston downtown record shops, and the rest were given away or sold when the band played at local clubs and venues. Newton still has the original 6\\" tape-reel and one of the vinyl singles in the wax-paper sleeve and cardboard jacket. Fate and other versions The original band folded in June 1984 and was reformed by Newton in August 1984 after he had moved from Boston to Costa Mesa, CA in Orange County. The California version of the band included: Newton (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Will Campbell (drums), Artemus Deane (bass and backing vocals), Garin Hauwels (lead guitar and backing vocals), and played in various venues throughout Orange County LA County, and San Diego from 1984 until 1987, when Newton moved to Amherst, MA to begin a PhD program at UMass. The California version of the band reformed briefly in August 1988 after Newton moved back to Orange County (new drummer Keith Sparks), and played together until May 1990 when Newton moved to Santa Barbara, where he formed a new band - NightWatch - that played until mid-1994.

However, many of the redesigned components closely resembled that of the previous generation, leading many to falsely believe that this generation is just a face-lift of the previous generation. The front nose was redesigned with slimmer headlights, while retaining the first generation's \\"bottom breather\\" nose, albeit in a more aerodynamically efficient design that flowed into the front bumper. In the rear, it received new taillights that closely resembled those of the previous generation, as well as an entirely new rear clip. The trunk was also redesigned, with a spoiler being integrated into the trunk lid's design to make the car more aerodynamically efficient. 1992 Taurus GL with grey bumpers and side trim. For 1993, the aforementioned parts became color keyed. Also with this generation, each model of Taurus received different exterior trim. The lowest level Taurus L had light grey plastic mirrors and window trim, while the bumpers and side trim were also light grey. The GL, the mid priced model, got chrome window trim and body color mirrors, while still retaining the grey bumpers and side trim. The top-of-the-line LX model had its bumpers color keyed, as well as having the grey side trim replaced with color keyed body cladding. 1992 L and GL models (and the Mercury Sable GS) could also be ordered with a two-tone paint job, in which instead of being grey, the bumpers and side trim were painted a slightly darker shade of the vehicle's body color. To cut costs, this was discontinued for the 1993 model year, as all models received color-matched trim and bumpers from that year onward. =Interior= 1995 Ford Taurus GL Interior The interior was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the previous generation, was designed to be user friendly. Like the previous generation, it had all of the vehicle's main controls located near the left side of the dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like the previous generation, all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the gauge cluster that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the previous generation, as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's side airbag, a first of its kind. It was optional in 1991 in 1992 models, and became standard in 1993, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have dual front airbags. The seats and door panels were also redesigned. The new door panels contained integrated armrests, with the controls for the power windows and locks mounted flat on its frontal part, allowing the driver to operate them without moving their arm. These switches, along with all of the main controls, would become illuminated when the headlights were turned on, allowing the driver to easily see them at night. Unlike the first generation, the interior was not as customizable in the second generation, and many options that were previously available were cut for 1992. The second generation now used only a single seat design shared with all models (the first generation LX got its own unique seat design), and was only available in two configurations; with a front bench seat and a column mounted shifter, or with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter. The console was a carryover from the first generation, although it was redesigned for 1993. The station wagon variant included dual fold-down rear-facing seats in the back =Models and engines= 1992 Ford Taurus sedan 1992 Taurus wagon For 1992, the Taurus was available in three models; L, GL, and LX. As with the first generation, the L was the basic model, the GL was the mid-priced value model, and the LX was the luxury model. Due to disappointing sales, the L was dropped after 1992, leaving the GL as the entry-level model. For the 1995 model year, a new SE model was added, intended to be a budget version of the SHO. It was a step above the entry- level GL, a step below the top of the line LX, and came standard with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor-mounted shifter, as well as a rear spoiler borrowed from the SHO. The SE was never available as a wagon. The second generation also came in a modified police version. A police Taurus was a GL trim with the 3.8 liter Essex V6 engine that was slightly different from the regular Essex engine. Output of the police Essex version was greater than the standard due to the addition of a dual exhaust muffler system, similar to that standard on the SHO; a Y-pipe was added after the resonator, which allowed for the split to both sides of the rear of the vehicle. Other changes included a larger fuel tank, stainless steel brake lines, standard four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, a modified front grille fascia that had a slit to allow for increased airflow to the radiator, and a certified calibration speedometer. Some were bought for speed limit enforcement, with the anonymity of the car aiding in the role. The Taurus police package didn't prove to be very popular, and it was often strongly outsold by Ford's own Crown Victoria. When the 2.5 L HSC four-cylinder was dropped in early 1991, along with the three-speed ATX automatic transmission, all following second-generation Taurus models came standard with the 140 horsepower (104 kW) 3.0 L Vulcan V6, except for the LX wagon that came with a 3.8 L Essex V6. The Essex was optional on all other Taurus models. Every engine in this generation used the four-speed AXOD-E automatic transmission, until 1993, when it was replaced by the four- speed AX4S transmission, which was used for the rest of this generation's production run in most models. Some 1994‚Äì1995 3.0 L came with the AX4N transaxle. This generation Taurus was exported to Japan in limited numbers, and sold at Japanese auto dealerships called Autorama (a joint venture with Mazda), where the Taurus SHO was the only model available in both sedan and wagon versions with left-hand driving positions until 1995. To Japanese buyers, it was regarded as a luxury vehicle as the exterior dimensions and engine displacement exceeded Japanese government regulations, and buyers in Japan were liable for additional taxes. Variants =Mercury Sable= Second-generation Mercury Sable Second-generation Mercury Sable A redesigned Mercury Sable, a sister model to the Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, went on sale alongside the Taurus in 1991. Like the first generation, the Sable shared all of the Taurus' mechanical components but had a unique body and interior. Similar to the Taurus, the second-generation Sable's design closely resembled the first-generation model, though the body and interior were almost completely redesigned and the new model was shorter than its predecessor; while the first generation Sable had an extended wheelbase, the redesigned model had the same wheelbase as the Taurus. The new model was still offered in GS and LS models in sedan and wagon bodies, a top-of-the-line LTS trim was offered on the sedan during the 1995 model year. Powertrains and most options were the same as the Taurus, though no counterpart of the Taurus SHO was offered. The Sable was produced concurrently alongside the Taurus through the 1995 model year. In 1993, Ford Canada hand-built 40 Mercury Sables powered by SHO V6 engines as part of their AIV (Aluminum Intensive Vehicle) program and released 20 to the public. Using aluminum suspension elements and aluminum body panels, held together with a spot welding process and adhesive joining process developed specifically for this vehicle, the end result was a car that was 400 pounds lighter than a SHO Taurus. In 1995, Multimatic Motorsports entered one of these vehicles in the One Lap of America event, finishing 15th overall and 1st in the Mid-Priced Sedan class. =Ford Taurus SHO= Second- generation Ford Taurus SHO The second-generation Ford Taurus SHO was launched in the fall of 1991, along with the Taurus. Unlike the first generation, this SHO contained less aggressive body cladding, as well as a unique front end using parts largely borrowed from the Mercury Sable. Like the Taurus and Sable, the SHO's drivetrain was carried over from the first generation. The only major change came on 1993s, when an automatic transmission became optional. Automatic equipped cars got a slightly bigger engine with equal horsepower due to less aggressive camshafts.

It was published by American company IDW Publishing in 2004. The series combines elements of science-fiction, cyberpunk, and horror, to tell the story of a post-apocalyptic dystopian future. The title is a reference to the multiple definitions of ‚Äòsingularity‚Äô. Burton C. Bell's introduction to the collected volume references the myriad ways in which the word can (and is) used in the comic, as well as giving a humorous nod to the 'singularity' of the writer. \\"‚Ä¶the definition [of singularity] expands beyond average intelligence. When I first heard the term, Stephen Hawking defined it when he was describing what might await at the bottom of black holes. All matter that is swallowed by the mighty gravitational pull of a black hole is reduced to a singularity, the size of an atom. That is mind blowing. The term is also used to describe that which is solely unique. This could be an individual or an object. Once in a great while, the world is graced with a Singularity. I believe this term is a perfect description for the latest addition to the world of graphic artists...\\" \\"Introduction to Singularity 7\\" Singularity 7. IDW Publishing. January 2005. Background The series marked a departure for Templesmith as it was his first attempt at scripting his own comic. In comparing the experience of writing Singularity to Wormwood: Gentleman Corpse he has said: \\"Singularity 7 was a first attempt at going it alone. I didn't want to start with Wormwood, so I wanted to pick another smaller thing first. Whatever the outcome of that mini-series was, the process was different to how I do it now. For Singularity 7 and such, I was doing all the art from a basic plot and then adding dialogue after the event. Now I write the whole thing out first, conversationally, and then map out the pages from there, just tweaking the dialogue at the end. I think it works a hell of a lot better, too.\\" \\"Ben Templesmith on Wormwood, Writing and Wonderland\\" . Silver Bullet. 23 June 2008. Silver Bullet Comics. Oct. 11, 2006 Story The comic tells the story of how Earth was forever changed after alien nanites arrived in a meteor shower. The nanites, able to shift the molecular structure of any material, bond with the mind of Bobby Hennigan who initially uses the nanites power to improve life on Earth by building complex machines and curing disease. Unfortunately, Bobby goes crazy, becoming a God-like monster called ‚ÄòThe Singularity‚Äô, destroying everything and forcing humanity to live deep beneath the surface of the Earth. This new world is post-apocalyptic, filled with monsters, poisonous gases, and the nanites, which are now used to devour human flesh. The only things able to go to the surface are the \\"Gosiodo\\" - part man / part machine creatures connected to the hive mind of the Singularity and sent out to hunt down the remaining humans, and \\"Specials\\" - rare humans who, when exposed to the nanites are mysteriously not killed and instead bond with the nanites, giving them access to strange powers and the ability to survive on the surface. Chon, a young man living in one of the underground cities has heard the stories of the \\"Topside\\" all his life, but shrugged them off as tall tales, until the Gosiodo find his city and expose it to nanites. Everyone is killed, except for Chon who becomes a Special with the ability to morph his arms into a liquid substance capable of eating through Gosiodo armor. Chon is found by a group of Specials led by Dead Eye. They bring Chon along with them to the largest remaining free city, where they have been summoned. Along the way, they are attacked by Gosiodo. Chon uses his arm morphing power against one and seemingly kills it. But in fact the Gosiodo lives, albeit disconnected from the hive mind of the Singularity. Chon and the Specials arrive at the free city to learn that scientists there have created a virus that can kill the nanites, but for it to work it must be injected directly into the Singularity, who is highly protected in the \\"dead city\\". All the surviving specials that could be found, seven including Chon, set off to deliver the virus, a likely suicide mission. The Gosiodo Chon almost killed attempts to reconnect to the hive, but is unable to. It comes across a woman carrying a baby. He notes that they look human but are in fact made of nanites. The Gosiodo wants to kill them, but can‚Äôt, something in his programming is preventing him. The Specials fight their way through the Gosiodo-infested topside, toward the dead city. Along the way, Acrona is killed. This disheartens the others as Acrona was the oldest living Special. Chon wants to give up and go home, but Dead Eye won‚Äôt let him. Meanwhile, the Singularity has sensed the approach of the Specials and fears they will ruin the coming of the \\"Masters\\". The woman with the baby appears at the free city and asks to be let in. When the humans allow her entrance, however, she tells them that she is, in fact, a bomb and subsequently explodes, killing everyone. At the edge of the Dead City, the Specials feel the deaths of so many humans. Again Chon and some of the other talk about giving up, but before they can move, Gosiodo surround them. The Specials fight their way to the center of the city and the Singularity. They arrive just as the mother ships of the Masters appear in the sky. The Specials attack the Singularity, but it makes short work of them, killing most of them, including Chon. Only Dead Eye and one other Special, Gunnar are left alive. The \\"Masters\\" land. We learn that they are an alien race that sent the nanites. (The nanites infect one person, creating the Singularity, which then wipes out all life on the planet and terraforms it for the Master's use). But this Singularity's programming was corrupted somewhere along the way, which is why it's struggled to finish off mankind. The Master kills the Singularity only to discover that there is a second Singularity, the disconnected Gosiodo. The Masters kill this as well, but before they can, Dead Eye injects the virus, which infects not only the Singularity, but also the Masters. The nanites are destroyed, but the virus causes a giant explosion, which kills everyone, save a single baby. Characters *Bobby Hennigan was once a regular guy, but when the nanites first came to Earth they took him over. For a while, he tried to do good with his newfound powers, but, soon, he went crazy and began killing everyone. *Chon, distinguished by the dragon tattoo on his face, is the protagonist of the story. He becomes a Special when his city is destroyed by Gosiodo. He has the ability to turn his arm into a gooey substance which disables the Gosiodo. He is one of the seven Specials sent to destroy the Singularity. *Geneva has black hair and carries swords. She also appears in the short story from IDW's Tales of Terror. *Acrona is the oldest Special, even though she looks like a little girl. She is able to blow things up with a burst of green light. *Deadeye is a Special whose eyes were eaten by nanites before they bonded with him. One of the seven Specials sent to destroy the Singularity, he is able to fight with a 'Nano-Sword'. *Gunnar is a Special who is able to make guns from nothing. *Gallis is the Special on the mission who can communicate with the free city. He has a chip implanted in his head which allows him to hear what the Professor is saying. He is the one who realizes when the bomb goes off and destroys the city. *Makko is a Special who can make hard weapons from nothing. The character is also notable for being the only human with brightly colored hair, in this case, blonde. Themes The series explores nanotechnology and its potential effects on human society. Templesmith, fascinated with the concept, has said that \\"nanotechnology will be like a tidal wave in a kiddie pool, compared to the information revolution our society has apparently recently gone through. It will transform everything.\\" Interview: Ben Templesmith , PopImage. 23 June 2008. The comic also grapples with the moral and religious implications of technology. In writing about how nanites would allow humanity to play with the very molecules that society is made out of, and thus turn ordinary humans into gods, Templesmith is able to compare technological advancements with religious miracles and ask important questions about destiny and humanity's fate.

This home was built for Henry Bradlee Junior, his wife Maude (Abbot) Bradlee and their son, Edward who was born in Boston in 1880.Massachusetts Public Records Henry and Maude were married on January 21, 1879Massachusetts Marriage Records and this house was in part a wedding gift to them.

History Model of the undestroyed palace and abbey complex of Dargun The monastery was founded here in 1172 on the site of a former heathen temple after the conquest of the region by Christian forces in 1164. The founding community came from Esrum Abbey in Denmark. The monastery was destroyed in 1198, and the monks left, later to found another monastery at Eldena. Dargun was re-established in 1208 by monks from Doberan Abbey, which is therefore counted as its mother house. It was secularised in 1552 and taken over as a residence by Duke Ulrich I of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow in 1556, who converted it into a Renaissance palace, which, after the extinction of the line of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, passed to the Dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Buildings The monastery was brick-built. The principal building complex was reconstructed in the 14th century. The Gothic abbey church was built between 1225 and 1270, with further work to the choir in 1464. The church is now ruined but parts of the choir, nave and transept remain. In 1637 the palace burnt down and was rebuilt until 1654. Until the mid-18th century it served as the home of the widows of the princely house of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. It was re-converted in the 19th century under Georg Adolf Demmler, and burnt down at the end of World War II. Little was done to secure the ruins until 1991. From 1994 some reconstruction and repair has taken place. The buildings presently accommodate an information bureau and the town library.

The battle took place during the period of increasing tension between France and China that eventually culminated in the Sino-French War (August 1884‚ÄìApril 1885).  Background  The Tonkin campaign is conventionally considered to have begun in June 1883, with the decision by the French government to despatch reinforcements to Tonkin to avenge the defeat and death of Henri Rivi√®re at the hands of Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army at the Battle of Paper Bridge on 19 May 1883. These reinforcements were organised into a Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, which was placed under the command of g√©n√©ral de brigade Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87), the highest-ranking marine infantry officer available in the French colony of Cochinchina. The French position in Tonkin on Bou√´t's arrival in early June 1883 was extremely precarious. The French had only small garrisons in Hanoi, Haiphong and Nam ƒê·ªãnh, isolated posts at Hon Gai and at Qui Nh∆°n in Annam, and little immediate prospect of taking the offensive against Liu Yongfu's Black Flags and Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m's Vietnamese.Duboc, 139‚Äì51; Huard, 83‚Äì4; ; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 59‚Äì60 During June the French dug in behind their defences and beat off half-hearted Vietnamese demonstrations against Hanoi and Nam ƒê·ªãnh.Huard, 84‚Äì8 The early arrival of reinforcements from France and New Caledonia and the recruitment of Cochinchinese and Tonkinese auxiliary formations allowed Bou√´t to hit back at his tormentors. On 19 July chef de bataillon Pierre de Badens, the French commandant sup√©rieur at Nam ƒê·ªãnh, attacked and defeated Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m's besieging Vietnamese army, effectively relieving Vietnamese pressure on Nam ƒê·ªãnh.Duboc, 156‚Äì7; Huard, 88‚Äì92; Nicolas, 262‚Äì4 The arrival of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet in Ha Long Bay in July 1883 with substantial naval reinforcements further strengthened the French position in Tonkin. Although the French were now in a position to consider taking the offensive against Liu Yongfu, they realised that military action against the Black Flag Army had to be accompanied by a political settlement with the Vietnamese court at Hu·∫ø, if necessary by coercion, that recognised a French protectorate in Tonkin. On 30 July 1883 Admiral Courbet, General Bou√´t and Jules Harmand, the recently appointed French civil commissioner-general for Tonkin, held a council of war at Haiphong. The three men agreed that Bou√´t should launch an offensive against the Black Flag Army in its positions around Phu Hoai on the Day River as soon as possible. They also noted that the Court of Hu·∫ø was covertly aiding and abetting Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, and that Prince Hoang was still in arms against the French at Nam ƒê·ªãnh. They therefore decided, largely on Harmand's urging, to recommend to the French government a strike against the Vietnamese defences of Hu·∫ø, followed by an ultimatum requiring the Vietnamese to accept a French protectorate over Tonkin or face immediate attack. The proposal was approved by the navy ministry on 11 August, and on 20 August, in the Battle of Thu·∫≠n An, the French stormed the forts at the mouth of the Hu·∫ø River, allowing them to attack Hu·∫ø directly if they chose.Huard, 103‚Äì22; Nicolas, 280‚Äì5; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 165‚Äì6; Histoire militaire, 62‚Äì4 The Vietnamese asked for an armistice, and on 25 August Harmand dictated the Treaty of Hu·∫ø to the cowed Vietnamese court. The Vietnamese recognised the legitimacy of the French occupation of Cochinchina, accepted a French protectorate both for Annam and Tonkin and promised to withdraw their troops from Tonkin. Vietnam, its royal house and its court survived, but under French direction.Huard, 122‚Äì30; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 166 While Harmand and Courbet were entrenching the French protectorate at Hu·∫ø, General Bou√´t attempted to carry out his part of the programme settled at the Haiphong conference of 30 July. On 15 August 1883, Bou√´t attacked Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army in its strong defensive positions in front of the Day River.  Forces involved  Liu Yongfu (1837‚Äì1917) General Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87) General Bou√´t committed 2,500 French and Vietnamese soldiers to the attack. The French force consisted of three marine infantry battalions (chefs de bataillon Chevallier, Lafont and Roux), three marine artillery batteries (Captains Isoir, Dupont and Roussel), four companies of Cochinchinese riflemen and around 450 Yellow Flag auxiliaries. The attackers advanced in three separate columns. The left column, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel R√©villon, consisted of a marine infantry battalion, a supporting company of Cochinchinese riflemen and two artillery sections. It was accompanied by the Yellow Flag auxiliary battalion.R√©villon's column included Chevallier's marine infantry battalion, the 1st Annamese Rifle Company (Captain de Beauquesne), 450 Yellow Flags, and two sections of Isoir's battery. Chevallier's battalion consisted of the 25th, 34th and 36th Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Poulnot, Larivi√®re and Lombard). The centre column, under the command of Bou√´t's chief of staff, chef de bataillon Paul Coronnat, consisted of a marine infantry battalion with a supporting company of Cochinchinese riflemen and a marine artillery battery.Coronnat's column included Lafont's marine infantry battalion, the 3rd Annamese Rifle Company (Captain Berger) and Dupont's battery. Lafont's battalion consisted of the 26th, 29th and 33rd Companies, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Lieutenant Goldschoen and Captains Jay and Trilha). The right column, under the command of Colonel Bichot, also included a marine infantry battalion, a supporting Cochinchinese rifle company and a marine artillery battery.Bichot's column included Roux's marine infantry battalion, the 4th Annamese Rifle Company (Captain Serre de Bazaugour) and Roussel's battery. Roux's battalion consisted of the 25th, 26th and 30th Companies, 4th Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Drouin, Tacco√´n and Martelli√®re). Bichot's column, whose right flank lay on the Red River, was supported by six French gunboats (Pluvier, L√©opard, Fanfare, √âclair, Mousqueton and Trombe) from the Tonkin Flotilla, under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Morel-Beaulieu. Bou√´t himself marched behind R√©villon's column with a small general reserve.Bou√´t's reserve consisted of the 21st Company, 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captain Buquet), the 2nd Annamese Rifle Company (Captain Boutet) and an artillery section (2nd Lieutenant Simon). The Black Flag Army seems to have fielded around 3,000 men. Although Liu Yongfu's forces did not substantially outnumber the French, they had built two lines of field fortifications to block the road to S∆°n T√¢y. The first, outpost, line ran from the village of Cau Giay near Paper Bridge, the scene of Rivi√®re's defeat and death on 19 May, to the Pagoda of the Four Columns (Quatre Colonneshttps://bibliotheques- specialisees.paris.fr/ark:/73873/pf0001485697/v0001.simple.selectedTab=record) on the Red River. The main line of defence ran behind it, taking in the villages of Phu Hoai, Noi and Hong.  The battle  French marine infantryman in Tonkin, 1883 R√©villon's left column unsuccessfully attacked the right of the Black Flag line and was counterattacked in its turn by Liu Yongfu and the bulk of the Black Flag Army. As ammunition was running short the French fell back towards Paper Bridge. Their retreat nearly turned into a rout, as the Vietnamese coolies with the column streamed to the rear in panic, blocking the dyke paths along which fresh supplies of ammunition were being brought forward. However, Chevallier's marine infantry battalion, firing from sheltered positions in the village of Vong, successfully covered the French withdrawal, inflicting heavy casualties on Black Flag units that left their defences and ventured out into the open. Towards nightfall Bou√´t committed his reserve, enabling R√©villon to stabilise his line. Having heard no news of the progress of the other two columns, Bou√´t ordered R√©villon's column to return to Hanoi the same evening. Colonel Bichot recovers Black Flag cannon abandoned at Quatre Colonnes The reason that Liu Yongfu was able to make such a powerful counterattack against R√©villon's column was because the other two French columns failed to put serious pressure on the enemy. Coronnat's centre column failed to make contact with the Black Flags at all, while Bichot's right column succeeded in capturing the village of Trem but was then held up in front of the Black Flag defences at Quatre Colonnes. On 16 August Bichot advanced to attack Quatre Colonnes, only to find that the Black Flags had abandoned their positions during the night. The battle had been fought in pouring rain, and during the night of 15 August the Red River burst its banks and began to flood the plains between Hanoi and Phu Hoai. The flooding effectively brought the battle to an end. Neither Coronnat nor Bichot was able to make any further headway on 16 August. Coronnat's column returned to Hanoi, while Bichot contented himself with occupying Quatre Colonnes and bringing back to Hanoi a number of cannon abandoned by the Black Flags in their retreat. The French would later claim that the floods had prevented them from inflicting a major defeat upon Liu Yongfu. In fact, the flooding was a disaster for the Black Flag Army. Liu Yongfu had to abandon his entrenchments in front of the Day River and fall back behind the river, leaving behind all his material and all his wounded. French casualties in the Battle of Phu Hoai were 17 dead (including 2 officers) and 62 wounded. The French estimated Black Flag casualties at around 300 dead and 800 wounded.Bastard, 189‚Äì97; Duboc, 162‚Äì78; Huard, 99‚Äì103; Lung Chang, 151-2; Nicolas, 264‚Äì77; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 163‚Äì5; Histoire militaire, 60‚Äì62  Significance  Although the French severely mauled the Black Flag Army during the battle and suffered relatively low casualties in return, their failure to win a clear victory against Liu Yongfu was widely noted. Although the atrocious weather was the most important reason for the failure of Bou√´t's attack, poor French command decisions and the extremely stubborn defence put up by the Black Flags were also contributory factors. The indecisive outcome of the battle discouraged many ordinary Tonkinese from supporting the French against the Black Flags, and in the eyes of the world was tantamount to a French defeat.Huard, 103 Notes  Footnotes  References * Bastard, G., D√©fense de Bazeilles, suivi de dix ans apr√®s au Tonkin (Paris, 1884) * Duboc, Emile, Trente cinq mois de campagne en Chine, au Tonkin (Paris, 1899) * Huard, L., La Guerre du Tonkin (Paris, 1887) * Lung Chang, Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Nicolas, V., Livre d'or de l'infanterie de la marine (Paris, 1891) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine fran√ßaise (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La Conqu√™te de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Phu Hoai Category:1883 in France Category:1883 in Vietnam Phu Hoai Phu Hoai Category:Tonkin campaign Category:History of Hanoi Category:August 1883 events Category:19th century in Hanoi ","title":"Battle of Ph·ªß Ho√†i"},{"id":"18101312","text":"Robert Merrell Gage (December 26, 1892 ‚Äì October 30, 1981) was an American sculptor, frequently credited or referred to as Merrell Gage.

Klein, dies at age 91 ‚Äì San Diego Union-Tribune, 7/2/09), also called Herb Klein, was best known as United States President Richard Nixon's Executive Branch Communications Director. Klein also served as Press Secretary for three of Nixon's campaigns and editor of the Copley Newspapers in San Diego before and after his time in the White House. Family life Klein was born on April 1, 1918. He was the son of George J. Klein and Amy Marie Cordes. He married Marjorie G. Galbraith in Long Beach, California on November 1, 1941. The couple had two daughters. He died aged 91 on July 2, 2009 after suffering a cardiac arrest at his home in La Jolla, California, according to reports from his family. Education Klein was a 1935 graduate of Theodore Roosevelt High School (Los Angeles) and earned a B.A. in Journalism in 1940 from the University of Southern California, where he was a Sports Editor for the Daily Trojan. Career Prior to his work as a media practitioner, Klein first served in the military. Two years after he graduated from college, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he became an officer until 1946. After this stint, he became the news editor of Alhambra Post-Advocate and special correspondent for Copley Newspapers. Klein kept these works until 1950. There was controversy about this part of his career because the Copley Newspaper chain has been rumored to be associated with the Central Intelligence Agency since 1947. In 1946, while still connected to the Post-Advocate and the Copley Newspapers, Klein was contracted to be the press agent for Richard M. Nixon's campaign for California's 12th congressional district seat. The candidate's victory in this election cemented a relationship with the young California politician. He was chosen to become Nixon's press agent for the California United States Senate seat campaign, which was won against Helen Gahagan Douglas in 1950. From 1950 to 1968 Klein worked for the San Diego Union serving first as features and editorial writer. He was promoted to editorial page editor, associate editor, and executive editor, before finally rising to the editor position. For the Dwight D. Eisenhower-Nixon California Presidential campaign in 1952, Klein was tapped as the publicity director. During the 1956 reelection campaign, Nixon again selected him as his national assistant press secretary. When Nixon decided to run for the presidency in 1960, Klein became his national press secretary. He was also Nixon's press secretary during his campaign for Governor of California in 1962. In 1968, Klein served as Nixon's National Communications Manager in his second run for the presidency. After the inauguration in 1969, Klein was chosen to be the new Communications Director for the Executive Branch, a post he held until his resignation on July 1, 1973. Klein joined the private sector again after his involvement with the Nixon administration. He held the position of vice president of Corporate Relations at Metromedia, Inc. from 1973 to 1977. He became a media consultant from 1977 to 1980 before serving as a Copley Press' editor-in-chief until his retirement in 2003. Memberships and awards Klein was a National Fellow of the American Enterprise Institute and a member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, serving on the board of directors from 1966 to 1968. Sigma Delta Chi officer, the national journalism society. Publications Klein authored the book Making It Perfectly Clear, an Inside Account of Nixon's Love-Hate Relationship with the Media, released by Doubleday in 1980, . Legacy Klein was a Life Trustee of the University of Southern California, and in 2007, the university established the Herbert G. Klein Lecture Series. The series features lectures at USC and in San Diego. The first lecture, in April 2007, was by J. Stapleton Roy, former U.S. Ambassador to China. The second, in San Diego, was by Tom Johnson, former Los Angeles Times publisher and CNN executive. The April 2008 lecture at USC was by Clark T. Randt, Jr., then U.S. Ambassador to China. Klein helped advise the university as it launched its influential U.S.-China Institute. Klein did much to support USC's efforts to become a global university.

Location and geography Beit Ur al- Fauqa is located west of Ramallah. It is bordered by Beituniya to the east, Deir Ibzi to the north, Beit Ur at-Tahta and Kharbatha al-Misbah to the west, and at-Tira and Beit Anan to the south. The villages of Beit Ur crown two hilltops, less than apart (with Beit Ur al-Fauqa some higher than Beit Ur al- Tahta) along Route 443, the biblical \\"ascent of Bethoron\\". For many centuries, the villages occupying their sites dominated one of the most historic roads in history. The ridge way of Bethoron climbs from the plain of Aijalon (the modern Yalo) to Beit Ur al-Tahta at ; it then carries on along the ridge, with valleys lying on either side, north and south, before reaching Beit Ur al- Fauqa at .

In 1993, Phang signed to EMI, releasing her fifth album, So Beautiful...To Be With You (ÊúâËëó‰Ω†‚Ä¶Â§öÈ∫ºÁæé), which included her first foray into more dance orientated tracks. In 1994, she released her first compilation Unfinished Novel (Êú™ÂÆåÁöÑÂ∞èË™™), which included the new single, Let Me Go With You (ËÆìÊàëË∑ü‰Ω†Ëµ∞), on which Eric Moo laid down vocals for. This proved to be a huge success, and her breakthrough album. Later the same year she released her first Mandarin language album, My Eyes...My Tears (ÊàëÁöÑÁúºÔºéÊàëÁöÑÊ∑ö), intended for the Taiwanese market. The year 1995 proved to be a pivotal one in her career, with the release of several popular albums, Awakening From A Dream (Â¶ÇÂ§¢ÂàùÈÜí), Fly With Love (Èö®ÊÑõËÄåÈ£õ) and Outside the Window (Á™óÂ§ñ). The latter album contained her greatest hit to date, All Because of You (ÂÆåÂÖ®Âõ†‰Ω†), which was used as the theme song for the movie, The Peace Hotel. During the same year she won several important awards, including the Commercial Radio Ultimate Song Billboard Award Presentation Ceremony's \\"Best Female Singer\\"; the RTHK Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Award Presentation Ceremony's \\"Ten Most Outstanding Pop Singers\\" and \\"Best Selling Female Artist\\"; Metro Radio Singer Award's \\"Best Female Singer Gold Award\\"; and the TVB Jade Solid Gold Award Presentation Ceremony's \\"Most Popular Female Singer\\". In 1996, this saw the launch of her second Mandarin language album, Trapped Bird (ÂõöÈ≥•), and the Cantonese album, Water (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥), which commemorated the 1996 Pat Sin Leng wildfire. She also recorded To Embrace Your Days (Êä±Ëëó‰Ω†ÁöÑÊó•Â≠ê), and performed her first solo concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum. In 1997, this saw the release of Wet Eyes (ÁúºÁùõÊøïÊøïÁöÑ) and I Have My World (ÊàëÊúâÊàëÂ§©Âú∞). In 1998, two more albums were released -One Thousand and One Nights (‰∏ÄÂçÉÈõ∂‰∏ÄÊôö) and True Voice. In September 1998, Cass married fellow DJ singer, Jan Lamb. In 1999, Phang signed to Sony Music (now known as Sony BMG), and quickly followed with her next album A Flower (‰∏ÄÊûùËä±). This marked a turn in her music, from soft ballads to light-hearted, up-beat melodies. The song To The Boys I've Loved (Áµ¶ÊàëÊÑõÈÅéÁöÑÁî∑Â≠©ÂÄë) came 6th in the Billboard Awards' Ten Best Songs category. In October, she recorded her next Mandarin album, Passionate Love (Â•ΩÂ•ΩÊÑõ), on which she sang a popular duet with Wang Lee-hom. During this year she also announced that she was pregnant with her first child. On 14 February 2000, her daughter, Jae Wing Lam (ÊûóÊ≥≥) was born. During this time she released her next album, As Beautiful As You Want (Ë¶ÅÂ§öÁæéÈ∫óÊúâÂ§öÁæéÈ∫ó), where she collaborated with Anthony Wong on the song Whirlpool. In 2001, she became the spokesperson for the Marie France Bodyline, which she shot two advertisements for. Several songs from her following albums, For Lisa (Áµ¶Lisa) and My... (ÊàëÁöÑ...) were used as theme songs for adverts and movies. In January 2002, she held her \\"Cass in the City\\" concert, and released a tribute album For the Boys (Áµ¶ÊàëÂî±ÈÅéÁöÑÁî∑Â≠©ÂÄë). The tracks from this record were exclusively covers of hits by male RTHK singers. A dynamic shift in her career took place when Cass was cast in the role of Teresa Teng, in a musical celebrating the life of the late singing legend. The role was hotly contested, with Sammi Cheng and Faye Wong both interested in the part. The musical opened to success on 26 July 2002. In September, Cass released what was to be her last album Precious Moments, which included four new songs and a best of selection. To date she has recorded no further albums. In 2004, Cass was pregnant again. Originally scheduled to perform at the Hong Kong Arts Festival, she was replaced by fellow Sony solo artist, Candy Lo. On 28 July 2004, she gave birth to the couple's second daughter, Ching Lamb ‚Äì since then she has made few public appearances. In Jan Lamb's comedy shows, Jan has joked that Cass is busy bringing up the kids, or alternatively that she is the 'manager' of him and their children. Nevertheless, she sometimes makes an appearance on her husband's show. In February 2012, Cass came out of her semi- retirement by performing for her good friend Wyman Wong at the Wyman Wong Coliseum Exhibition Concert. There was subsequent speculation that she would be returning to the music industry; her manager, Candy Leung, and her husband have both denied this. Cass herself has also refused to comment.

Built in stages beginning about 1847, it was the residence of Sam Houston from 1847 to 1859. The house is now part of Sam Houston Memorial Museum, and is a National Historic Landmark. Description and history Woodland is the centerpiece of the museum property at the southeast corner of the Sam Houston State University Campus. It is a 1-1/2 story log structure, finished in wooden clapboards and covered by a gabled roof. It is a classic dogtrot house, with a central breezeway flanked by rectangular log chambers, with brick chimneys at the ends. A shed-roof porch extends in front of the breezeway, supported by square posts. The breezeway includes a winding staircase which provides access to loft spaces used as bedrooms. The house was little more than a single-room log cabin when Sam Houston began enlarging it in 1847. In that year, he added the breezeway and second log structure. Later alterations improved the upper level, including construction of the staircase, and apparently reversing the front and back of the house. Houston's family occupied the house until 1859, the period during which he served as a United States Senator, and as Governor of Texas. Houston's signature achievements, the independence of Texas and its subsequent annexation to the United States, happened before he took up residence here. The house is now accompanied by a reconstruction kitchen outbuilding, as well as the restored cabin that he used as a law office.

It may incorporate techniques from optics, chemistry, biology or image analysis to permit rapid, highly parallel research into how cells function, interact with each other and how pathogens exploit them in disease.Hsiao, A., & Kuo, M. D. (2009). High-throughput Biology in the Postgenomic Era. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology, 20(7), S488‚ÄìS496. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2009.04.040 High throughput cell biology has many definitions, but is most commonly defined by the search for active compounds in natural materials like in medicinal plants. This is also known as high throughput screening (HTS) and is how most drug discoveries are made today, many cancer drugs, antibiotics, or viral antagonists have been discovered using HTS.Kalinina MA, Skvortsov DA, Rubtsova MP, Komarova ES, Dontsova OA. Cytotoxicity Test Based on Human Cells Labeled with Fluorescent Proteins: Fluorimetry, Photography, and Scanning for High- Throughput Assay. Molecular Imaging & Biology. 2018;20(3):368-377. doi:10.1007/s11307-017-1152-0 The process of HTS also tests substances for potentially harmful chemicals that could be potential human health risks. HTS generally involves hundreds of samples of cells with the model disease and hundreds of different compounds being tested from a specific source. Most often a computer is used to determine when a compound of interest has a desired or interesting effect on the cell samples. Using this method has contributed to the discovery of the drug Sorafenib (Nexavar). Sorafenib is used as medication to treat multiple types of cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC, cancer in the kidneys), hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and thyroid cancer. It helps stop cancer cells from reproducing by blocking the abnormal proteins present. In 1994, high throughput screening for this particular drug was completed. It was initially discovered by Bayer Pharmaceuticals in 2001. By using a RAF kinase biochemical assay, 200,000 compounds were screened from medicinal chemistry directed synthesis or combinatorial libraries to identify active molecules against activeRAF kinase. Following three trials of testing, it was found to have anti-angiogenic effects on the cancers, which stops the process of creating new blood vessels in the body.Hautier G. Finding the needle in the haystack: Materials discovery and design through computational ab initio high-throughput screening. Computational Materials Science. 2019;163:108-116. doi:10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.02.040 Another discovery made using HTS is Maraviroc. It is an HIV entry inhibitor, and slows the process and prevents HIV from being able to enter human cells.Maraviroc. AHFS Consumer Medication Information.

Accessed October 25, 2019 It is used to treat a variety of cancers as well, reducing or blocking the metastasis of cancer cells, which is when cancer cells spread to a completely different part of the body from where it started. High throughput screening for Maraviroc was completed in 1997, and finalized in 2005 by Pfizer global research and development team. High- throughput biology serves as one facet of what has also been called \\"omics research\\" - the interface between large scale biology (genome, proteome, transcriptome), technology and researchers. High throughput cell biology has a definite focus on the cell, and methods accessing the cell such as imaging, gene expression microarrays, or genome wide screening. The basic idea is to take methods normally performed on their own and do a very large number of them without impacting their quality Taly, Valerie, Bernard T. Kelly, and Andrew D. Griffiths. \\"Droplets as microreactors for high‚Äêthroughput biology.\\" ChemBioChem 8.3 (2007): 263-272. High throughput research can be defined as the automation of experiments such that large scale repetition becomes feasible. This is important because many of the questions faced by life science researchers now involve large numbers. For example, the Human Genome contains at least 21,000 genes, all of which can potentially contribute to cell function, or disease. To be able to capture an idea of how these genes interact with one another, which genes are involved in and where they are, methods that encompass from the cell to the genome are of interest.  Use of robotics  Classical High throughput screening robotics are now being tied closer to cell biology, principally using technologies such as High-content screening. High throughput cell biology dictates methods that can take routine cell biology from low scale research to the speed and scale necessary to investigate complex systems, achieve high sample size, or efficiently screen through a collection.  Use of microscopy and cytometry  High-content screening technology is mainly based on automated digital microscopy and flow cytometry, in combination with IT-systems for the analysis and storage of the data. \\"High-content\\" or visual biology technology has two purposes, first to acquire spatially or temporally resolved information on an event and second to automatically quantify it. Spatially resolved instruments are typically automated microscopes, and temporal resolution still requires some form of fluorescence measurement in most cases.This means that a lot of HCS instruments are (fluorescence) microscopes that are connected to some form of image analysis package. These take care of all the steps in taking fluorescent images of cells and provide rapid, automated and unbiased assessment of experiments.  Development of technology  The technology can be defined as being at the same development point as the first automated DNA sequencers in the early 1990s. Automated DNA sequencing was a disruptive technology when it became practical and -even if early devices had shortcomings- it enabled genome scale sequencing projects and created the field of bioinformatics. The impact of a similarly disruptive and powerful technology on molecular cell biology and translational research is hard to predict but what is clear is that it will cause a profound change in the way cell biologists research and medicines are discovered.

It was a minimalist design based on Bensen's B-5 and consisting of little more than a seat mounted on wooden skids and with a two-blade rotor mounted on a tubular framework above it. Small fins for directional stability were mounted at the rear of the skids. The pitch of the rotors was fixed, but a handlebar allowed them to be tilted for directional control. The B-6 was intended to be towed aloft behind a car or boat. The machine became airborne at 19 mph (31 km/h), and with 300 ft (90 m) of tow rope, could achieve a maximum altitude of 150 ft (46 m). The rope could be detached to allow the machine to autorotate to the ground, taking up to 15 minutes to do so. The machine could also become airborne in a sufficiently strong wind of around 23 mph (37 km/h).

From its beginnings as a rural outpost of the Plymouth Colony, the city grew to become the largest textile producing center in the United States during the 19th century, with over one hundred mills in operation by 1920. Even with the demise of local textile productions during the 20th century, there remains a lasting legacy of its impact on the city. Early history 1812 Map of Fall River. The diagonal line represents the border between Massachusetts and Rhode Island At the time of the establishment of the Plymouth Colony in 1620, the area that later became the city of Fall River was inhabited by the Pokanoket Wampanoag tribe, headquartered at Mount Hope in what is now Bristol, Rhode Island. The \\"falling\\" river that the name Fall River refers to is the Quequechan River (pronounced \\"Quick-a-shan\\" by locals). Quequechan is a Wampanoag word believed to mean \\"Falling River\\" or \\"Leaping/Falling Waters.\\" In 1653, Freetown, Massachusetts was settled at Assonet Bay by members of the Plymouth Colony, as part of Freeman's Purchase, which included the northern part of what is now Fall River. In 1683 Freetown was incorporated as a town within the colony. The southern part of what is now Fall River was incorporated as the town of Tiverton, as part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1694, a few years after the merger with the Plymouth Colony. In 1746, in the settlement of a long colonial boundary dispute between Rhode Island and Massachusetts, Tiverton was annexed to Rhode Island, along with Little Compton and what is now Bristol County, Rhode Island. The state boundary was placed approximately at what is now Columbia Street. In 1703, Benjamin Church, a prominent veteran of King Philip's War, established a sawmill, a gristmill and a fulling mill on the Quequechan River. In 1714, Church sold his land, including the water rights, to Richard Borden of Tiverton and his brother Joseph. (This transaction became extremely valuable 100 years later, helping to establish the Borden family as the leaders in the development of Fall River's textile industry.) Native settlement during this time was confined to a reservation near what is now Notre Dame Cemetery. Later the reservation was shifted to the eastern shore of Watauppa Pond. The reservation fell apart in the early 20th century.Colonel Benjamin Church By the mid-18th century, Thomas Borden (son of Richard) operated a sawmill and a gristmill on the south bank of the Quequechan River, while Joseph Borden ran a fulling mill further upstream. Steven Borden operated a gristmill and sawmill on the north bank of the river. During this time, settlement also occurred in the northern part of modern-day Fall River, along what is now North Main Street. The oldest remaining house in Fall River, located on French Street, was built in 1750. On May 25, 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Freetown was fought when about 150 English soldiers, under the command of Major Ayers, sailed up Mount Hope Bay in the night and landed near the mouth of the Quequechan River. Spotted by a sentinel, the ship was fired upon by several local minutemen, their gunfire returned by cannon fire. Several British soldiers disembarked to lay siege on the village, burning the house, gristmill and sawmill of Thomas Borden, and taking his aged father, Richard, prisoner, burning his house as well. The prisoner was eventually released after several days, and the British retreated from Freetown altogether. The Freetown minutemen were aided by a colonist militia from the Tiverton outpost led by Captain Joseph Durfee, a war veteran recently returned from a battle at White Plains and son of Thomas Durfee Esq. of Freetown. The British suffered two casualties as a result of the light fighting. The colonists suffered no losses.The Battle of Freetown Later in 1788 during the Revolutionary War, the area was visited by the Marquis de Lafayette, the famed French war hero who was a guest of Joseph Durfee's father Thomas Durfee. The 1750s-vintage house is now located at 94 Cherry Street in Fall River, and is open to the public for tours.Lafayette-Durfee House to open to the public, Herald News article Today, Lafayette Park in the city's East End is named for the French war hero. Town of Fall River established Richard Borden On February 26, 1803 \\"Fallriver\\", Massachusetts was incorporated as a town. A year later, on June 1, 1804, Fallriver changed its name to \\"Troy\\". The name \\"Troy\\" was used for 30 years and was officially changed to the separated \\"Fall River\\" on February 12, 1834.History of Fall River, Massachusetts, Merchants Association, 1911 The early town consisted of about two dozen families, including Richard Borden and his father Thomas. (His grandfather, Richard (Sr.) (b.1722 d.1795) had been kidnapped by the British in May 1778, according to \\"Reminiscences of Colonel Joseph Durfee,\\"[7] who was then a Captain of the local Freetown Militia.) The other notable family names included Durfee, Buffington, Davol and Cook.Thesis: \\"Development of Entrepreneurship in Fall River\\", Lamb, Robert Keen, 1935 The First Congregational Church in Fall River was organized in 1816. The church began with five members. Their first meeting house was dedicated in 1823. Some years later, they sold it to the Unitarian Society. That society later sold it to the city, which made a schoolhouse of it. It was burned in the great fire of July 1843. Other early churches established in Fall River include the First Baptist Church (1825), Methodist Church (1826), Unitarian Society (1832), and the Episcopal Church of the Ascension (1836). Irish Catholics had been established in a small house by 1836, with their first church, St. John the Baptist, dedicated in 1840.History of the First Congregational Church of Fall River =The two Fall Rivers= During this time, the southern part of what is now Fall River (south of Columbia Street) remained part of Tiverton, Rhode Island. In 1856, the town of Tiverton voted to split off its industrial northern section as Fall River, Rhode Island. In 1861, after decades of dispute, the United States Supreme Court moved the boundary to what is now State Avenue, thereby creating a City of Fall River entirely within Massachusetts. (Also as part of this decision, Pawtucket, Massachusetts became part of Pawtucket, Rhode Island.)Fall River, Rhode Island =The great fire of 1843= By 1843, the town of Fall River was a bustling center of about 8,000 people, along with the adjacent population in what was then still Tiverton, Rhode Island. On Sunday, July 2, 1843, with the temperatures in the 90s, a fire alarm rang out around 4 p.m. Water in the Quequechan River had been stopped so that some work could be done. The fire had begun when two boys were playing with a small cannon, igniting a pile of wood shavings near the corner of Main and Borden Street. Fed by high, dry winds, the entire space of buildings between Main, Franklin, Rock and Borden streets soon became engulfed in fire, beyond the control of firefighters. Much more destruction may have occurred if it had not been for a change in wind direction which blew the flames back toward the charred areas. The conflagration destroyed a total of 291 buildings over about at the heart of the town. About 200 families were left homeless by the blaze. The city lost vital shops, the custom house, post office, hotels, churches, and banks. An appeal for relief was made on July 4, 1843 by local officials. A total of over $50,000 () was donated by people in Boston, Cambridge, Providence, New Bedford and other local towns. Early industrial development (1811-1865) Durfee's Mill, 1811 The early development of the textile industry in Fall River grew out of the developments made in nearby Rhode Island, beginning with Samuel Slater at Pawtucket in 1793. In 1811, Col. Joseph Durfee, the American Revolutionary War veteran and hero of the Battle of Freetown in 1778, established the Globe Manufactory (a spinning mill) at the outlet of Cook Pond, near what is now Globe Corners in the city's South End. This was the first textile mill in the city of Fall River (although it was still in Rhode Island at the time). It was never very successful. The first mill burned a few years later and was rebuilt and reorganized by Oliver Chace in 1813. It later operated as a print works from 1829‚Äì1839, being known as the Riverton Print Works from 1835‚Äì1839; later owned by Globe Yarn Co.; later by Laurel Lake Mills.History of Massachusetts Industries, Vol. 1, Stone, Orra L., 1930 The real development of Fall River's industry, however, occurred along the falling river from which it was named, about a mile north of Durfee's first mill. The Quequechan River's eight falls combined to make Fall River the best tidewater privilege in southern New England. It was perfect for industrialization - big enough for profit and expansion, yet small enough to be developed by local capital without interference from Boston.The Run of the Mill, Dunwell, Steve, 1978 The Fall River Manufactory was established by David Anthony and others in 1813. That same year, Oliver Chace and others founded the Troy Cotton & Woolen Manufactory in 1813, at the top end of the falls. Originally from Swansea, Massachusetts, Chace had worked as a carpenter for Samuel Slater in his early years. In 1817, the Fall River Manufactory installed the first power looms in the city. The Pocasset Manufacturing Company was established in 1821, just downstream from the Troy Mill, across the street from where the Herald News is today. Oliver Chace served as its first agent. =Fall River Iron Works= In 1821, Col. Richard Borden established the Fall River Iron Works along with Maj. Bradford Durfee at the lower part of the Quequechan River. Bradford Durfee was a shipwright, and Richard Borden was the owner of a grist mill. After an uncertain start, in which some early investors pulled out, the Fall River Iron Works was incorporated in 1825, with $200,000 in capital. The iron works began producing nails, bar stock, and other items such as bands for casks in the nearby New Bedford whaling industry. They soon gained a reputation for producing nails of high quality, and business flourished. By 1845, the company was valued at $960,000. In 1827, Col. Borden began regular steamship service to Providence.Herald News Article on Fall River Iron Works The iron works continued to play an important role in the early development of the textile industry in Fall River. Richard Borden later constructed the Metacomet Mill in 1847, which today is the oldest remaining textile (cloth-producing) mill in the city, located on Anawan Street. Also in 1847, the Fall River Gas Company was established by the iron works. Gas was produced by heating coal and capturing the gas in a special process. =Cloth printing= In 1824, Andrew Robeson, arrived from New Bedford and established the first print Works in the city,The New England states: their constitutional, judicial, educational, commercial, professional and industrial history, Volume 1. a segment of the industry that Fall River dominated in later years. By 1833 Fall River had 13 cotton mills, employing 1,200 people, with 31,000 total spindles (a common measure of total spinning capacity) and 1,050 looms. The American Print Works was established in 1835 by Holder Borden, uncle of Colonel Richard. With the leadership of the Borden family, the American Print Works (later known as the American Printing Company) became the largest and most important textile company in the city, employing thousands at its peak in the early 20th century. =Other factories= Oliver Chace established a thread mill on Bay Street in 1838. It was later used as an office as part of the Connanicut Mills. Today, it is the oldest remaining textile factory in the city, although it never produced cloth. Nearby, a twine mill was established by Augustus Chace and William Trafford in 1845, on the stream from Cook Pond. It later became known as the Wyoming Thread Mill. In the later 19th century it became part of the Marshall Hat Company and was greatly added onto with a large brick mill. By 1845, the Quequechan's available power had been all but maximized. The Massasoit Mill, located near what is now Heritage State Park, was established in 1846 as the first mill in the city to be powered by steam engine. However, it was another decade or so when the improvements in the steam engine by George Corliss enabled the construction of the first large steam-powered mill in the city, the Union Mills in 1859 on Pleasant Street. It was the first mill to be built \\"above the dam\\" along the Quequechan River. The Wamsutta Steam Woolen Mill was built in 1846, above the dam near Pleasant Street. The loom-making firm of Kilburn, Lincoln & Co. traces its roots to an 1847 merger of E.C. Kilburn, which made looms, and J.T. Lincoln, which built shafting components. Kilburn, Lincoln & Co. looms became well known in the textile industry during the late 19th century. The American Linen Company was founded in 1852 on Ferry Street for the manufacture of fine linen fabrics. However, in 1858, with demand for linens low, it was converted for the manufacture of cotton print cloth, although the name \\"American Linen Company\\" remained. The production of linen was gradually phased out. =Infrastructure= Fall River's port played a vital role in the city's fortunes for much of its history. It was designated a port of entry by the federal government as early as 1837, when that designation was switched from nearby Dighton. Coal began to be imported from Nova Scotia as early as 1833, along with iron from Sweden. Colonel Richard Borden also established the first railroad line to serve Fall River, the Fall River Branch Railroad, which was incorporated in 1844 and opened about 1845. Two years later, regular steamship service to New York City began. Known as the Fall River Line, it was America's most luxurious steamship line, connecting rail travelers from Boston to Manhattan. It operated until 1937. The Old Colony Railroad and Fall River Railroad merged in 1854, forming the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad. That same year, Fall River was officially incorporated as a city and had a population of about 12,000.Illustrated History of Fall River, 1903 James Buffington served as its first mayor. For three generations, the Borden family dynasty had control or business interests in the city's banks, the gas company, steamboats, railroads and mines. Cotton boomtown (1865-1923) Granite Mill #2, Fall River Fall River profited well from the Civil War and was in a fine position to take advantage of the prosperity that followed. By 1868, it had surpassed Lowell as the leading textile city in America with over 500,000 total spindles. It maintained this distinction until the mid-1920s, when it was overtaken by nearby New Bedford. Destroyed by fire in 1867, the American Print Works was soon rebuilt in 1868. Several other new mills were established during the late 1860s, including the Davol, Mechanics and Durfee Mills. Then, during 1871 and 1872, a most dramatic expansion occurred, when 15 new corporations were founded, building 22 new mills throughout the city, while some of the older mills expanded. The city's population increased by an astounding 20,000 people during these two years, while overall mill capacity double to more than 1,000,000 spindles. On September 19, 1874 the deadliest fire in Fall River's history occurred at the Granite Mill. When the fire occurred, it quickly cut off access to the stair tower and the single exit. The fire department's ladders were not high enough to reach the victims. Workers on the sixth floor began jumping from windows in a desperate effort to escape the flames. Thirty were killed, and many more were injured for life. The mill was gutted and was later rebuilt. As a result of the tragedy, all mills were required to have at least two exits. Metal fire escapes were also required.Phillips History of Fall River By 1876 the city had 1/6 of all New England cotton capacity, and one half of all print cloth production. \\"King Cotton\\" had definitely arrived. The \\"Spindle City\\", as it became known, was second in the world to only Manchester, England. To house the thousands of new workers, mostly Irish and French Canadian immigrants during these years, over twelve thousand units of company housing were constructed. Unlike the well- spaced boardinghouses of early Lowell and Lawrence or the cottages of Rhode Island, worker housing in Fall River consisted of thousands of wood-framed multi-family tenements, usually three-story \\"triple-deckers\\" with up to six apartments. Many more privately owned tenements supplemented the company housing.The Run of the Mill, Dunwell, Steve, 1978, p.105-110 During the 19th century, the city of Fall River became famous for the granite rock upon which much of the city is built. Several granite quarries operated during this time, the largest of which was the Beattie Granite Quarry, located near what is now Quarry Street, near the corner of Locust.2003 Herald News article on Fall River Granite Many of the mills in the city were built from this native stone, and it was highly regarded as a building material for many public buildings and private homes alike. The Chateau-sur-Mer mansion in Newport, Rhode Island, is perhaps the best example of Fall River Granite being used for private home construction. While most of the mills \\"above the hill\\" were constructed from native Fall River granite, nearly all of their counterparts along the Taunton River and Mount Hope Bay were made of red brick. This was due to the high costs associated with transporting the rock through the city and down the hill, where no rail lines existed because of the steep grades. In 1911, the city hosted the \\"Cotton Centennial\\", a large celebration of the city's textile industry, which was attended by President William Howard Taft.Providence Journal article, September 5, 2003 Decline of the textile industry Stafford Mills, Fall River The cotton mills of Fall River had built their business largely on only one product: print cloth. About 1910, the city's largest employer, the American Printing Company (APC), employed 6,000 people and was the largest company printer of cloth in the world. Dozens of other city mills solely produced print cloth to be printed at the APC. The city's industry truly had all its eggs in one very large basket. World War I had provided a much needed demand for the textiles, and many of the mills of New England benefited during this time. The post-war economy quickly slowed, however, and production quickly outpaced demand. The northern mills faced serious competition from their southern counterparts due to factors such as lower labor and transportation costs, as well as the South's large investment in new machinery and other equipment. In 1923, Fall River faced the first wave of mill closures. In 1924, the American Printing Company opened a new plant in Kingsport, Tennessee, moving much of its operation there, and slashing many Fall River jobs in the process. Some mills merged and were able to limp along until the late 1920s. By the 1930s and the Great Depression, many more mills were out of business, and the city was bankrupt. A few somehow managed to survive through World War II and into the 1950s. The worst fire in Fall River's historySailsinc.org occurred on the evening of February 2, 1928, when workers were dismantling the recently vacated Pocasset Mill. During the night the fire spread quickly and wiped out a large portion of downtown. City Hall was spared, but was badly damaged. Today, many of the structures near the corner of North Main and Bedford Street date from the early 1930s, as they were rebuilt soon after the fire. The once mighty American Printing Company finally closed for good in 1934. In 1937, their huge plant waterfront on Water Street was acquired by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and soon employed 2,600 people. In 1941, just five weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor, a huge fire broke out in the old 1860s main building of the print works. The fire was a major setback to the U.S. war effort, as $15 million in raw rubber (30,000 lbs.) was lost in the inferno.Keeley Library Collection By 1940, there were just 17 companies still in operation, compared to 49 in 1917.Phillips History of Fall River With the demise of the textile industry, many of the city's mills were occupied by various smaller companies, including the garment industry, traditionally based in the New York City area, but attracted to New England by the lure of cheap factory space and an eager workforce in need of jobs. By 1940, nearly one-fifth of the city's workforce was employed in the garment industry. This industry survived in the city well into the 1990s, but also became a victim of globalization and foreign competition.MHC Survey, 1982History of Fall River's Garment Industry Modern era The Braga Bridge Under Construction Fall River City Hall In the 1960s the city's landscape was drastically transformed with the construction of the Braga Bridge and Interstate 195, which cut directly through the heart of the city. In the wake of the highway building boom, the city lost some pieces of its history. The Quequechan River was filled in and re-routed for much of its length. The historic falls, which had given the city its name, were diverted into underground culverts. A series of elevated steel viaducts were also constructed to access the new Braga Bridge. Many historic buildings were demolished, including the Old City Hall, the 150-year-old Troy Mills, the Second Granite Block (built after the 1928 fire), as well as several other 19th century brick-and-mortar buildings near Old City Hall. Constructed directly over Interstate 195, where its predecessor was, the new city hall (officially known as \\"Fall River Government Center\\") was finally opened in 1976, after years of construction delays and quality control problems. Built in the Brutalist style so popular in the 1960s and 1970s, the new city hall drew complaints from city workers and residents almost immediately. Also during the 1970s, several modern apartment high-rise towers were built throughout the city, many under the auspices of the Fall River Housing Authority. There were two built near Milliken Boulevard, two on Pleasant Street in Flint Village, another on South Main Street and one in the north end off Robeson Street. Today, these high-rises are known by a variety of names, and most serve as housing for the elderly. In 1978, the city opened the new B.M.C. Durfee High School in the north end, replacing the historic Rock Street masterpiece that had become overcrowded and outdated for use as a high school. The new Durfee is currently one of the largest high schools in Massachusetts. Recent history Meditech Building, opened in 2008 on the former site of Kerr Mills In the 1980s the city of Fall River suffered three more huge, disastrous fires. Although nobody was killed in any of these events, the city lost three historically important structures. On November 5, 1981, the 100-year-old Richard Borden Mill on Rodman Street caught fire in the afternoon and burned for many hours through the night. During the massive fire, the Fall River Fire Department poured many thousands of gallons of water on a Shell Gasoline station just next door to the mill at the corner of Plymouth Avenue, preventing a possible explosion that would have created much more damage. Then, just a few months later, on May 11, 1982, while in the process of a major renovation project, hot sparks from a worker's torch ignited a fire near the roof of the Notre Dame de Lourdes Church in the city's Flint Village section. Fed by high winds and dry roof timbers, the fire spread quickly, soon engulfing the twin copper-clad spires of the church as well as several triple- decker apartment houses across Bedard Street. The raging inferno was so hot, there was nothing the fire department could do but watch and try to prevent other buildings from burning. The high winds made the job ever so difficult, and in the end, the church was a complete loss, along with dozens of neighboring buildings, destroying an entire city block between Bedard Street and Pleasant Street. A new church was built in the same location in 1986. Finally, on January 12, 1987, the huge Kerr Mill Complex, also in the city's East End along South Watuppa Pond, was destroyed in a massive inferno that began in the historic 1899 Thread Mill on Eastern Avenue and spread along the entire complex. The mills had been occupied by many companies, and over 900 people suddenly found themselves without jobs. The Kerr Mill site was redeveloped in the late 1990s, and in 2001 the Advanced Technology & Manufacturing Center of UMass-Dartmouth opened its doors at this location.ATMC History Page More recently, the MediTech building opened on the western side of the property, with a garage built on the site of the 1899 mill in front of the building. =Mayor Correia= In January 2016, Mayor Jasiel Correia took office as the youngest mayor in city history, at age 23. In 2018, Correia was arrested and charged with wire fraud and filing false tax returns. The City Council called on Correia to resign; he refused, and was put up for recall election in March 2019. On the same ballot as the recall election, voters were asked to choose among five people for the mayor's job. Thus, on the same ballot Correia simultaneously was recalled and won re-election. In 2019 Correia was charged by federal prosecutors with bribery and extortion in connection with distributing favors to marijuana vendors in exchange for cash bribes. Correia was defeated for re-election in November 2019 by Paul Coogan.

It occupies the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church complex, located at 1345 Gratiot Avenue. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1981 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Its current pastor is Rev. Darryl L. Andrzejewski. History The Trinity congregation was formed in 1850, when members of St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, a German-speaking congregation, broke from the main body following the excommunication of another member. Services were first held in the chapel of Christ Episcopal Church, located at the corner of Jefferson and Hastings. Soon, the congregation bought the chapel of the Western Seaman's Friend Society of Woodbridge Street, and moved it to Rivard and Larned. This building quickly proved too small, so the congregation built a new brick church at Gratiot and Rivard in 1866. This area, surrounding Eastern Market, was at the time home to a large German population and a natural fit for Trinity. Around this time, many schools, missions, and other congregations were begun by Trinity throughout the region. In total, 132 Lutheran parishes in south-east Michigan can be traced to Trinity. In 1905, the congregation built a new school and social hall near the church. However, the community around Trinity soon changed as families left the downtown area, and the flow of new German immigrants stopped. Trinity began offering English services in addition to those in German. In the late 1920s, Trinity began considering renovation of its 1866 structure. However, congregant Charles Gauss stepped forward and offered to finance the building of a new church. The old church was demolished, and the cornerstone of the current church was laid in 1929 with the dedication held on February 15, 1931. After World War II, the population of downtown Detroit began moving in droves to the suburbs, and many Detroit churches, including Trinity, lost membership. However, then-pastor Gilbert Theodore Otte remained firm in keeping the church in the downtown area. The city of Detroit recognized the 1931 church structure for its historical significance in 1979, as did the state of Michigan in 1982. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Membership, however, declined, with only 112 church members in 1981. In 1983, Rev. David Eberhard became pastor, a post he would hold until 2015, and instituted additional programs that tripled membership in five years. The church continues to be a gathering place for Detroit Lutherans, with over 2100 members in 2012. The parish operates under the Historic Trinity name and is a member of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod.

The river rises from the Gwydir River west of Pallamallawa, and flows generally west and west, south-west, joined by eight minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Barwon River near Collarenebri; descending over its course. History Mehi River Bridge at Moree The river which branches off at the Tareelaroi Weir was previously known as the Gwydir River or Meei River. The Geographical Names Board of New South Wales officially named Mehi as the tributary of the Gwydir River in 1975 ending years of confusion over the naming of this section. In 1889 a timber bridge was erected over the Mehi River at Moree. Another bridge was built over Mehi River, Moree in April 1960. A bridge over the Mehi River, west of Moree, was completed in December 1995. A total of four bridges cross the Mehi River in Moree; two of these bridges are low-level and subject to flooding. The area adjoining the river has numerous attractive riverside parks, golf links and reserves. The Mehi River jetty at Moree is a popular spot for water sports. During 2008 plans were drawn up to install a fish passage at Moree which will open up a \\"freeway\\" for native fish between Copeton Dam and Collarenebri. The Barwon River-Gwydir Catchment Management Authority has provided $175,000 to Moree Plains Shire Council to install a fish passage at the Moree Town Weir. The Mehi River and the Carole and Gil Gil creeks have been channelised to assist with delivery of water to the irrigation industry. Native fish that are found in the Gwydir-Mehi river system include bony bream, Murray cod, spangled perch, golden perch, which are often known as yellowbelly and eel-tailed catfish. =Flooding= Moree has been flooded regularly over the years by the Mehi River. Recent major flooding reached a peak of , on 27 November 2011, on the Moree gauge, the 4th highest flood in the history of Moree. The highest ever flood was in February 1955 where the Mehi River reached a peak of which left 800 buildings in northern Moree with flooding above floor level. The Gwydir Highway, too is subject to flooding of the Gwydir and Mehi Rivers (the highway is actually on an island in the middle of these two rivers near Collarenebri). Moree can also become isolated by road and rail when floods are high enough. Such was the case in the February 1971 floods when Moree was isolated for two weeks. Vast agricultural areas in the Mehi River floodplain become flooded in large floods. Some areas remained underwater for days, and in some cases, as long as a couple of weeks costing farmers thousands of dollars in ruined crops.

It began publishing in the 1960s in Mason and was known as The Pulse-Journal for most of its history. In 2013, it merged with The Western Star of Lebanon and the Fairfield Echo of Fairfield in 2013. Since then, the paper has consisted of two Sunday editions, Journal-News Pulse of Warren County in southern Warren County and Journal-News Pulse of Butler County in eastern Butler County. Journal-News Pulse shares staff and resources with sister publications Journal-News and Dayton Daily News. History In the 1960s, Pat and Delores Diangelo began publishing the free Mason Shopping Guide out of their Mason home. The paper moved to an office in downtown Mason in the late 1960s. In the 1970s, the paper became The Pulse and began publishing in a broadsheet format. Thomson Newspapers' Journal Publishing Company purchased the Pulse, renaming it the Mason Pulse-Journal after sister publications JournalNews of Hamilton and The Middletown Journal of Middletown. It was renamed again to the Pulse-Journal in 1977. In the late 1990s, the paper moved to a shopping plaza south of downtown Mason. In July 2000, Cox Ohio Publishing exercised a right of first refusal against a proposed sale of the Pulse-Journal and Thomson's other southwestern Ohio publications to Gannett Company, owner of The Cincinnati Enquirer. After purchasing the papers in September of that year, Cox moved them to a consolidated office in Liberty Township. In 2007, the paper's Mason/Deerfield edition under editor Thomas Barr and Chris Celek, Warren County editor of Cox Ohio Publishing's Southwest Group, garnered several national awards. It earned three Suburban Newspapers of America (now Local Media Association) first place honors as Non-Daily Newspaper of the Year, and also first place for Best Sports Section and for Best Headline. Also in 2007, it named PulseJournal.com Best Local Community Website. In 2006, the paper's Mason/Deerfield edition, under the same editors, was named Best Non-Daily Newspaper in the nation by Inland Press Foundation.http://www.inlandpress.org/contests/ On January 17, 2013, the Pulse-Journal and sister weeklies The Western Star and Fairfield Echo published their final editions as separate publications. On January 17, they were replaced by Today's Pulse of Warren County, a product of The Western Star and Today's Pulse of Butler County, a product of the Fairfield Echo. The Western Star had been Ohio's second-oldest newspaper and oldest weekly newspaper, having published since 1807. Whereas the three former papers delivered on Thursdays, Today's Pulse delivered on Sundays, to compete directly with the Enquirers Sunday edition. On October 6, 2016, Today's Pulses website was consolidated into the Journal-Newss website. In early 2018, Today's Pulse name was changed to the Journal-News Pulse to match the daily publication's name.

The band's live performances contrast with its in- studio counterpart; although Reznor is in complete creative control of Nine Inch Nails in-studio, he typically assembles groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for live performances. In 2009, Reznor announced that Nine Inch Nails was no longer touring, but that he would continue to create music under the name. In 2013, he announced that Nine Inch Nails would return to the stage and revealed tour dates for the Twenty Thirteen Tour. The band's lineup has changed consistently throughout the band's history, with Reznor remaining the only constant. Notable musicians who have contributed to live performances include Richard Patrick, Chris Vrenna, Jeordie White, Robin Finck, Josh Freese, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Charlie Clouser, Danny Lohner, and Jeff Ward. In 2016, frequent Reznor collaborator and multi-instrumentalist Atticus Ross was announced as an official member of Nine Inch Nails, becoming the only person other than Reznor to have held an official position in the band. The configuration of Nine Inch Nails as a live band has evolved consistently. Early incarnations of the band featured three people playing guitar, drums, keyboards, and samplers. Later incarnations replaced the keyboards and samplers with an additional guitarist, and further incarnations added a bassist. The live component later settled on a five-piece band between the Self Destruct Tour in 1994 and Lights in the Sky tour in 2008. In September 2007, Reznor expressed his interest in moving away from the \\"rock band configuration\\" to explore \\"other ways [to] present the material in concert\\", and by 2009 the live band was once again pared down to four positions. Between major tours, live band members have on occasion contributed instrumental performances to official Nine Inch Nails releases, though creative control and direction has always been the responsibility of Reznor. Nine Inch Nails has released one album and four videos featuring the live band: Closure (1997), a double-VHS set featuring live performances from the Self Destruct Tour; And All That Could Have Been (2000), released in CD and double-DVD formats featuring performances from the Fragility Tour; Beside You in Time (2007), released on Blu-Ray and DVD and featuring performances from the Live: With Teeth Tour; and Another Version of the Truth (2009), an officially sanctioned fan-made release in HD and triple-DVD sets featuring performances from the Lights in the Sky Tour.

Between tours, Finck performed briefly with Cirque du Soleil and then with Guns N' Roses. Following a four-year touring hiatus, the Nine Inch Nails live-band reformed in 1999 for the Fragility tour, again featuring Finck contributing on guitar. At the conclusion of the Fragility tour in 2000, Finck returned to Guns N' Roses, and was replaced by Aaron North for Live: With Teeth in 2005. There are various reports that suggest there was animosity between Finck and Reznor during the Fragility tours, which may have led to Finck declining the invitation to the following tours. In 2008, Finck rejoined Nine Inch Nails, playing on The Slip and joining the live band for the Lights in the Sky tour and the following Wave Goodbye tour. Finck has contributed on the most tours of all the past live members, playing for the Self Destruct, Fragility, Lights In The Sky, Wave Goodbye, Twenty-thirteen, I Can‚Äôt Seem To Wake Up and Cold Black And Infinite tours. :He was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction roster in 2020. ;Alessandro Cortini :Active: 2004‚Äì2008, 2013‚Äìpresent :Instruments: keyboards, synthesizers, guitar, vocals, bass guitar, percussion :Live-release contributions: Beside You in Time (2007), Another Version of the Truth (2009), Live 2013 EP (2013) :Studio-release contributions: Year Zero Remixed (2007) (as Modwheelmood), Ghosts I‚ÄìIV (2008), The Slip (2008), Hesitation Marks (2013) :Prior to the Live: With Teeth tour in 2005, Reznor held open auditions to replace live-band members who had left the group during the five years between tours.

Between tours, Cortini contributed to some of the Nine Inch Nails studio-material, gaining co-writing credits on Ghosts I‚ÄìIV (2008) and a performance credit on The Slip (2008). At the conclusion of the Lights In The Sky Over North/South America tour in late 2008 Cortini announced his departure from the band to pursue other music projects. No replacement was hired for him, and the 2009 incarnation of the live band was a 4-piece group, with the role of keyboard player shared between the 4 band members. Cortini returned to the live band for its 2013 and 2014 tours. During the I Can‚Äôt Seem To Wake Up/Cold Black And Infinite tours, Cortini began to transition to playing more guitar and bass, due to the addition of Atticus Ross on keyboards and synthesizers. :He was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction roster in 2020. ;Ilan Rubin :Active: 2009‚Äìpresent :Instruments: drums, programming, percussion, piano, synthesizers, vocals, cello, ukulele, guitar, bass guitar :Live-release contributions: Live 2013 EP (2013) :Studio-release contributions: Hesitation Marks (2013) : Ilan Rubin was named as the drummer to succeed Freese.

History R. Rated was created, executive produced and hosted by stand-up comic Richard O'Donnell, billed simply as \\"R.\\" (hence the title of the show). O'Donnell co-directed it with Edward Seaton. Short form video works from the ID, Ectomorph (Darren Bodeker, Bart Heird and Jim Kopsian), and the Annoyance Theater Productions featured Rachel Dratch (Saturday Night Live), Mick Napier (The Second City), and Stephnie Weir (MADtv). Former Second City and Saturday Night Live alumni Tim Kazurinsky offered a Willy Laszlo directed short about the most unusual home invader while O'Donnell appeared in an array of impromptu \\"man on the street interviews\\" and monologues amidst spectacular bumpers and teasers created by Steve Wood and Peter Neville. Wood used graphics while Neville used live subjects such as New Age Vaudeville member Bobby McGuire. Musical acts included The Swinging Love Hammers, Kleen Ex-Girl Wonder, and The Gathering Field. Production O'Donnell requested Fox to keep the show out of prime time so that his contributors like Mick Napier of the infamous Annoyance Theatre, could have greater late-night artistic freedom without black-bar and sound bleep censorship. Regarded as very Chicago- centric, R. Rated was \\"...exactly what creator R. O'Donnell set out for: a fun, inventive half-hour showcasing Chicago talent.\\" O'Donnell also hoped his new TV comedy series would earn greater recognition for a wide array of Chicago talent. DVD A fifth show was produced but never aired, in spite of high ratings that outpaced competing shows in the same time slot including the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn on Chicago's Channel 2 and Mancow TV on Channel 26. R. Rated drew an average 2.9 rating out of 7 shares in its time slot, tying with Ch. 7 and Ch. 50 programming. Executives at Fox 32 awarded R. Rated with another 26 weeks of broadcasting, but the variety show unexpectedly lost its primary sponsor. R. Rated (only available through bootlegs on DVD) remains an extraordinary and rare collection of Chicago's variety and comedic talent on the rise in the late 1990s.

His sound is known for an eclectic mix of alternative folk and psychedelic rock as well as strong melodic content. His guitar technique makes use of numerous alternate tunings. His introspective songwriting is influenced by Elliott Smith and Radiohead.On The Record: SCOTT LISS & THE SIXTY-SIX Biography =Baltimore, Philadelphia, and NightOnlyVisual= In the fall of 2000, Liss moved to Baltimore, Maryland to attend UMBC to study music composition and recording. It was during this time that he first began to write and record his original music in the university's recording studio. He also spent this time meeting other artists involved in the Baltimore music scene. In December 2000 he formed the art rock band Katrien with fellow musicians Evan Madden (Woods of Ypres, The Green Evening Requiem), Kresimir Tokic, Dan Smith, and Seb Roberts. The group played numerous shows throughout Baltimore and recorded a handful of demos before breaking up in 2002. Liss began performing solo. Around this time he began to write what would eventually become his first full-length studio album. In June 2004, Liss graduated from UMBC and moved to New York. He immediately began to record his first album at Retromedia Sound Studios in Red Bank, NJ with producer John Noll and engineer Paul Ritchie of The Parlor Mob. Liss released his first album, entitled Skylines, in June 2005 under the moniker NightOnlyVisual. Reviewing critics called the album \\"gorgeous and inspiring, as well as wholly characteristic and continually engaging\\" and \\"a strong fist in the air over the heads of hundreds of thousands of self-indulgent rock acts\\".Origivation Magazine After the release of Skylines, Liss moved to Philadelphia to play music with his old drummer Evan Madden. Ultimately deciding to remain solo, Liss performed throughout Pennsylvania and gained a strong foothold in Philadelphia's indie folk music scene. Towards the end of 2006 he began commuting in to New York City to involve himself in the underground anti-folk music scene. =New Jersey and the Sixty-Six= In early 2007 Liss moved to Red Bank, New Jersey with the encouragement of the rising music scene of the New Jersey shore. Teaming up once again with Paul Ritchie who was this time producing, Liss began recording new material at Retromedia Sound Studios. Through Ritchie, Liss met New Jersey-native alternative rock artist Nicole Atkins.Art informs N.J. songstress' music  Philadelphia Inquirer  25 March 2008 Atkins lent her talents to some of these new recordings singing backup vocals.http://houstonist.com/2008/03/06/interview_nicol.php Additional musicians during these sessions included David Rosen and Sam Bey (both members of the rock band the Parlor Mob) as well as Anthony Chick and Jeff Plate (of the garage rock band Sikamor Rooney). After spending the rest of 2007 developing himself as a solo artist within the Asbury Park, NJ music scene, Liss was given the opportunity to perform during the 2008 South by Southwest Music Conference held in Austin, TX. Liss assembled a band including drummer James Griffith and bassist Gianni Scalise. Though only intended to be a temporary lineup for the SxSW festival, the three musicians decided to remain a band and in June 2008 formed Scott Liss & the Sixty-Six.Singer Scott Liss is playing solo no more  APP.com  Asbury Park Press As of September 2009, Scott Liss completed his second full-length album. The album, titled The Blackpool Letters, was recorded and mixed primarily at Retromedia Sound Studios, with additional tracking at Shorefire Studio in NJ, with tracks produced by both Paul Ritchie and Scott Liss.

The trio took on a noticeably different style, one with a more aggressive rock edge. Shortly thereafter, in April 2011, the Sixty-Six as a live group parted ways. According to his website, Scott had begun working on new material and a new record apart from his band. As the sole songwriter of the Sixty-Six's music, Scott stated he had been \\"grateful to have been able to branch off towards a more \\"aggressive, progressive\\" style and write music for performers that could tear it up\\", but that once it ran its course he was focusing on a return to his roots in \\"acoustic music with greater dynamic range\\".Scott Liss  Glowing Shades of Gray Discography =NightOnlyVisual= *2005: Skylines =Scott Liss= *2008: Black Label EP =Scott Liss and the Sixty-Six= *2010: The Blackpool Letters =Scott Liss= *2011: Unreleased EP =Scott Liss= *2016: Modern Isolation References External links *Scott Liss ‚Äì official website.

This breed can also be found in some areas of Guilan- Zanjan border. Mean adult live weight in this breed is 35 kg (77 lbs) for rams and 31 kg (67 lbs) for ewes. The coat colour for this breed is yellowish-white to pure white, but brown patches are found on the head, face and at the bottom of the legs.

Two people near the centre are in dispute, and one person in-between them tries to mediate. Three people are watching. In 1752, Henry Fielding started a \\"paper war\\", a long term dispute with constant publication of pamphlets attacking other writers, between the various authors on London's Grub Street. Although it began as a dispute between Fielding and John Hill, other authors, such as Christopher Smart, Bonnell Thornton, William Kenrick, Arthur Murphy, and Tobias Smollett were soon dedicating their works to aid various sides of the conflict. The dispute lasted until 1753 and involved many of London's periodicals. It eventually resulted in countless essays, poems, and even a series of mock epic poems starting with Smart's The Hilliad. Although it is unknown what actually started the dispute, it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported Fielding or supported Hill, and few in between. Background Fielding started a \\"paper war\\" in the first issue of The Covent-Garden Journal (4 January 1752) by declaring war against \\"hack writers\\".Poetical Works p. 443 In response, John Hill claimed in the London Daily Advertiser (9 January 1752) Fielding had met with him prior to January and proposed what would be a fake paper war that would involve London writers \\"giving Blows that would not hurt, and sharing the Advantage in Silence.\\"Bertelsen p. 135 Such a meeting between Fielding and Hill to discuss the proposed war is believed to have occurred (if it occurred) on 28 December 1751.Bertelsen p. 149 It is known that Hill met Fielding for legal business between 26 and 28 December 1751 after Hill was robbed.Battesin p. 556 Before Hill had revealed this information, he attacked Fielding's Amelia in the London Daily Advertiser on 8 January 1752. The book's title character, Amelia, was involved in an accident that damaged her face, and Hill, mocking the way Fielding described the scene, claimed that she \\"could charm the World without the Help of a Nose.\\"Sabor p. 96 In response to both the revelation and personal attacks, Fielding wrote on 11 January 1752: \\"If the Betrayer of a private Treaty could ever deserve the least Credit, yet his Lowness here must proclaim himself either a Liar, or a Fool. None can doubt that he is the former, if he hath feigned this Treaty, and I think few would scruple to call him the latter, if he had rejected it.\\"Covent-Garden Journal No. 3, 11 January 1752Battesin p. 555‚Äì556 Regardless of the merits of Hill's claim, a war was soon started: by the third issue of The Covent-Garden Journal, Fielding narrowed his satire upon John Hill. Although Hill, Fielding, Smart, Thornton, Kenrick, Murphy, and Smollett were all involved in the dispute, not all of them used their actual names; instead, many preferred to use pseudonyms along with attacks under their own name: Fielding wrote as \\"Sir Alexander Drawcansir\\"; Hill wrote as \\"The Inspector\\"; Thornton wrote as \\"Madam Roxanna\\"; and Smart wrote as \\"Mrs. Mary Midnight\\". It was under these pseudonyms that various authors soon responded to Fielding's attacks and to Fielding's plan for a \\"Universal Register Office\\", a planned center of advertisement of jobs, goods for sale, and other items.Bertelsen p. 137 If this was not enough, Fielding started a dispute, just a few months before, with Philip D'Halluin, a former employee who established the competing \\"Public Register Office\\" in King Street, Covent Garden, who hired Bonnell Thorton, a friend of Smart, to attack Fielding and Hill. However, Hill had previously aided Fielding in this matter.Bertelsen p. 138 Later, Hill attacked both Fielding and Smart, 13 August 1752, in the only issue of The Impertinent to be produced. Although the work was published anonymously, it was commonly known that it was produced by Hill, and he soon followed up the pamphlet with his 25 August 1752 The Inspector column in the London Daily Advertiser. With the column, he harshly criticized Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. Fielding eventually left the dispute after the sixth issue of The Covent-Garden Journal was published.Goldgar p. 119 Event Although it is quite possible that the first work in the \\"war\\" was produced by Smart on 29 April 1751,Mahony and Rizzo Item 128 it is also possible that the origins of the dispute could be traced even further back to Hill's publications between February and March 1751. Fielding's first paper in the \\"war\\" was also the first issue of The Covent-Garden Journal on 4 January 1752.Bertelsen p. 138 In it, Fielding attacked all of the writers of Grub Street, which brought a quick response. Hill responded twice and claimed that Fielding was planning a fake dispute on 9 January 1752, Smollet attacked Hill's piece on 15 January 1752, and Thornton soon responded against Fielding in Have At You All: or, The Drury Lane Journal on 16 January 1752. During this time, personal works, such as Fielding's Amelia, became targets.Battesin p. 534 On 11 January 1752, Fielding responded to Hill and those who supported his view of Amelia in The Covent-Garden Journal by stating: Hill was not the only one to attack the work; Thornton wrote satires of Amelia in the Drury-Lane Journal. Thornton's satires were first published on 16 January 1752 and included a fake advertisement for a parody novel called \\"Shamelia\\", playing off of title of Fielding's parody Shamela. He later parodied Amelia again on 13 February 1752 in a piece called \\"A New Chapter in Amelia.\\" Tobias Smollett joined in and published the pamphlet Habbakkuk Hilding anonymously on 15 January 1752. Although there were many attacks against Fielding's novel, there was some support for the work, and an anonymous pamphlet was written to attack \\"Hill and 'the Town'\\" while praising Amelia.Battesin p. 537 On 25 January 1752, Fielding defended his work again by bringing the novel before the imaginary \\"Court of Censorial Enquiry\\", in which Hill and the other critics are the prosecutors and it is they, not Amelia, that are truly put on trial. The Covent-Garden Journal served Fielding well and he used it in his pants upon Hill and Hill's supporters in the Journal piece called \\"Journal of the present Paper War between the Forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansirs pants, and the Army of Grub-street\\".Battesin p. 555 The work was modelled after Jonathan Swift's The Battle of the Books and Fielding pretended to be a military leader that would lead \\"English VETERANS\\" against those who were compared to characters from the Greek and Roman classics along with those from modern French literature. However, he changed roles on the fourth issue, produced on 14 January 1752, and transformed himself into a \\"judge\\". By February, Kenrick joined in and \\"dramatized\\" the \\"Paper War\\" in a production called Fun and proceeded to defend Fielding.Battesin p. 557 Charles Macklin followed suit by holding a benefit on 8 April 1752 at the Covent Garden with a two-act play called The Covent Garden Theater, or Pasquin Turn'd Drawcansir; the play portrayed Fielding attacking the Hill and his followers, the \\"Town\\". A pamphlet in the London Daily Advertiser published on 29 January 1752 called The March of the Lion pants links various authors involved in the war and is the first to introduce Smart via a reference to his \\"Mrs. Mary Midnight\\" pseudonym, although Smart was not yet a participant.Bertelsen p. 139 However, Smart did begin directly participating in the matter 4 August 1752 with the publication in The Midwife of a parody on Hill's \\"Inspector\\" persona.Bertelsen p. 143 In the piece, Smart responded to Hill's attack on Smart's \\"Old Woman's Oratory\\" show and Hill's claim that the show was dead. Hill was quick to respond; he attacked both Fielding and Smart in a piece published on 13 August 1752 in the only issue of The Impertinent. In the work, Hill claimed that authors either write because \\"they have wit\\" or \\"they are hungry\\".The Impertinent No 1. 13 August 1752 He further claimed that Smart, With his 25 August 1752 The Inspector column, Hill harshly criticised Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. Although Hill claimed to praise Smart, he did so in a manner, as Betty Rizzo claims, \\"that managed to insult and degrade Smart with patronizing encouragement.\\"Rizzo p. 343 Arthur Murphy responded to this essay, and to Hill, in the 21 October 1752 edition of the Gray's Inn Journal.Bertelsen p. 144 Following Murphy, Thornton attacked both Hill and Fielding in The Spring- Garden Journal on 16 November 1752. The Gentleman's Journal issue of November 1752 came out with a quick retort and claimed that those who supported Hill \\"espoused the cause of Gentleman\\" and those who sided with Fielding espoused the cause \\"of the comedian.\\"Rizzo pp. 344‚Äì345 This essay accomplished little but to polarise both sides even more. Hill then responded to Murphy, and their dispute was printed in a supplement of the December issue of the Gentleman's Journal. On 1 February 1753, Smart published The Hilliad, an attack upon Hill that one critic, Lance Bertelsen, describes as the \\"loudest broadside\\" of the war. The response to The Hilliad was swift: Samuel Derrick responded directly with his The Smartiad, Arthur Murphy criticized Smart for his personally attacking Hill, and Rules for Being a Wit tried to provoke further response from Smart.Mounsey p. 142 However, Smart stopped responding to either of these assaults. Soon after, Hill ended his attacks with the final shot in December 1752. Notes References * Battestin, Martin. Henry Fielding: A Life.

The title is a play on Alexander Pope's The Dunciad with a substitution of Hill's name, which represents Smart's debt to Pope for the form and style of The Hilliad as well as a punning reference to the Iliad. In \\"Book the First\\" of The Hilliad, Hillario is seduced by a Sibyl to give up his career as an apothecary and instead becomes a writer. However, his fortune quickly descends with Hillario ultimately turning into the \\"arch-dunce\\". The origins of the work come from a dispute between Hill and Henry Fielding; a \\"paper war\\" that involved a widespread literary dispute, Hill turned his attention to Smart and published attacks upon Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. In response, Smart wrote The Hilliad, claiming it as the \\"balance due\\" on Hill's treatment towards his person and poetry. The work was responded to by multiple parties, but it was the last major contribution of Smart in the literary conflict and attacks upon Smart soon ceased. Although the work is only of one book that is 259 lines long, its \\"Notes Variorum\\" attached to the work more than doubles the length. It is unknown who contributed to the notes, but it is thought that Smart, along with Arthur Murphy and Henry Fielding, put them together. Background \\"Account between Mr. Smart and Dr. Hill\\", a summary of Hill's criticism on Smart During 1751, Smart was involved with the Old Woman's Oratory and devoted a substantial portion of his time putting together that production and his other comedic works.Mounsey p. 129 However, the Oratory was controversial and caused Smart a great deal of stress. It was under these conditions that he tried to publish his collection of poems, Poems on Several Occasions, 1752.Mounsey p. 130 Before the publication of the Poems, Henry Fielding and John Hill were involved with a dispute involving many London writers.Poetical Works p. 443 Henry Fielding started a \\"paper war\\" in the first issue of The Covent-Garden Journal (4 January 1752) against \\"hack writers\\". In response, John Hill claimed in the London Daily Advertiser (9 January 1752) that Henry Fielding proposed a fake paper war that would involve them \\"giving Blows that would not hurt, and sharing the Advantage in Silence.\\"Bertelsen p. 135 Such an event is believed to have occurred (if it occurred) on 28 December 1751.Bertelsen p. 149 Regardless of the merits of either sides' claims, a war began that drew in many authors, such as Christopher Smart, Bonnell Thornton, William Kenrick, Arthur Murphy, and Tobias Smollett. However, both Hill and Fielding had previously attacked Philip D'Halluin, and D'Halluin hired Bonnell Thorton, a friend of Smart's, to respond in kind.Bertelsen p. 138 Not far after Thorton's involvement in the dispute, a pamphlet in the London Daily Advertiser called The March of the Lion, 29 January 1752, introduces Smart via a reference to his \\"Mrs. Mary Midnight\\" pseudonym, although Smart was not yet a participant.Bertelsen p. 139 During this conflict, Smart tried to publish his first collection, and the 851 people subscribers to Smart's Poems could not keep it from coming under attack. In the August 1752 Monthly Review, Hill derided the Poems and singled out The Hop-Garden for a particularly harsh review.Sherbo p. 89 Combined with other attacks, Hill began to provoke Smart into a literary conflict.Mounsey p. 131-132 On 11 November 1752, Smart announced his production of The Hilliad in the Gray's-Inn Journal.Mounsey p. 134 Before the dispute, Smart had a mix relationship with Hill, but had a generally positive, lighthearted view of Fielding and his works.Bertelsen p. 136 Although Smart previously wrote \\"pro\\" and \\"anti\\" Fielding articles, it is possible that Smart was pushed towards writing The Hilliad by Arthur Murphy or Fielding. By December 1752, Smart was reading excerpts of the mock-epic poem \\"at Alehouses and Cyder Cellars\\" according to The Inspector of 7 December 1752.Bertelsen p. 144 The Hilliad was first published on 1 February 1753 (London) and later in May (Dublin).Poetical Works p. 239 The Hilliad \\"Balance\\" on Hill's attacks The Hilliad is prefaced by a letter from Smart and a reply possibly written by Murphy.Poetical Works p. 444 Both seek to draw connections between The Hilliad and the works of Alexander Pope and Fielding that criticize the \\"corruption\\" of modern writers. Following these letters is a \\"Prolegomena to the Hilliad\\" that claims to be an \\"extract from a paper called the Impertinent. Published Aug. 13, 1752. Written by Dr. Hill.\\"Poetical Works p. 222 The \\"extract\\" included an attack upon Smart. Following this \\"extract\\" is another from the August 1752 Gentleman's Magazine page 387 that responds to Hill's piece. Included in the work is \\"An Accurate and Impartial STATE of the ACCOUNT Between Mr. Smart and Dr. Hill.\\"Poetical Works p. 224 The \\"account\\" includes 12 essays, six by Hill that claims Smart as his \\"debtor\\" for various \\"praises\\" and six that are \\"per contra creditor\\" over \\"his abuse\\".Poetical Works p. 226-227 Although the \\"account\\" compiles all of the essays together, the original essay written by Hill was published 9 March 1751 and was not followed until 13 August 1752. At one point, John Newbery actually included a publisher's note to directly attack Hill's claims that he helped establish Smart by introducing the young poet to Newbery.Poetical Works p. 227 The reason for adding the twelve \\"accounts\\" becomes clear when the editor ads the essays together and claim that The Hilliad is \\"Due on the Balance to the INSPECTOR.\\"Poetical Works p. 238 Although the \\"accounts\\" are satirically laid out, according to Lance Bertelsen, they represent \\"precisely the exchange of praise and abuse, and the notoriety established by such exchanges, that generated sales that put shillings in capricious hungry authors' pockets.\\"Bertelsen p. 146 =Book One= First page The work is supported by a series of \\"Notes Variorum\\", a set of footnotes that nearly double the length of the work.Poetical Works p. 239-260 They were likely written by Murphy, although possibly supplied directly by Smart.Foot p. 106 Years later, Jesse Foot described the creation of the notes as \\"Mr. Smart walking up and down the room, speaking the Verses, and Mr. Murphy writing the notes to them.\\" However, it is quite possible that Fielding also contributed to the notes.Rizzo p. 348-353 There are various pseudonyms used in the extensive footnotes that more than double the length of the work: \\"Quinbus Flestrin\\", of Swift origins, is a play off of Samuel Derrick; \\"Martinus Macularius, from the word \\"macula\\" and a combination of \\"Martinus Scriblerus\\" of Pope's The Dunciad and of \\"Margelina Scribelinda Macularia\\" of Kenrick's Old Woman's Dunciad, is a play off of Hill. Besides just drawing of names from two \\"Dunciads\\", the Dublin edition acknowledges that the work is an imitation of the original The Dunciad. Among the notes and verses, Smart praises various people, such as William Boyce, Fielding, Hogarth, and Garrick, while he attacked Henley and a Dr. Rock.Sherbo p. 91 At the beginning of his poem, Smart addresses his subject, Hill/Hillario, by saying: :O thou, whatever name delight thine ear, :Pimp! Poet! Puffer! 'Pothecary! Play'r! :Whose baseless fame by vanity is buoy'd, :Like the huge earth self-center'd in the void, :Accept one part'ner thy own worth t'explore, :And in thy praise be singular no more. (The Hilliad lines 6-12) These lines echo the lines of The Dunciad when Pope addresses Jonathan Swift as \\"Dean, Drapier, Bickerstaff, or Gulliver!\\" However, the lines could be self-referential because Smart, like Hill and Swift, used many titles himself. The first action of the poem is of a Sybil that comes to Hillario: :A tawny Sybil, whose alluring song, :Decoy'd the 'prentices and maiden throng :First from the counter young HILLARIO charm'd (The Hilliad lines 6-12) Her charms transform Hillario from an apothecary into \\"th' INSPECTOR\\" (The Hilliad line 58). She is reminiscent of Pope's Dulness character, although she also has traits deriving from Smart's \\"Mrs Midnight\\".Bertelsen p. 146-147 Hillario's transformation is only to doom him; he quickly becomes \\"The UNIVERSAL BUTT of all mankind\\" (The Hilliad line 237). The poem does not end there, but instead expands with Fame declaring: :\\"While in the vale perennial fountains flow, :And fragrant Zephyrs musically blow; :While the majestic sea from pole to pole, :In horrible magnificence shall roll, :While yonder glorious canopy on high, :Shall overhang the curtains of the sky, :While the gay seasons their due course shall run, :Ruled by the brilliant stars and golden sun, :While wit and fool antagonist shall be, :And sense and taste and nature shall agree, :While love shall live, and rapture shall rejoice, :Fed by the notes of Handel, Arne and Boyce, :While with joint force o'er humour's droll domain, :Cervantes, Fielding, Lucian, Swift shall reign, :While thinking figures from the canvass start, :And Hogarth is the Garrick of his art. :So long in flat stupidity's extreme, :Shall H-ll the' ARCH-DUNCE remain o'er every dunce supreme.\\" (The Hilliad lines 242-259) Critical response One of the first responses to the poem was a notice by Murphy in his Gray's Inn Journal on 20 January 1753 that claimed The Hilliad as \\"an excellent Poem upon a very bad Subject\\", but also states that Smart was ill.Sherbo p. 93-94 The negative reaction to Smart's mock-epic were quick to come but not necessarily harsh: Samuel Derrick responded directly with a satirical poem, The Smartiad in February 1753; Arthur Murphy, like Derrick, criticized Smart for his personally attacking Hill; and Rules for Being a Wit tried to provoke further response from Smart.Mounsey p. 142 However, Smart stopped responding to either of these assaults. Instead, Smart, in the prologue of Fielding's The Mock Doctor, claimed to \\"throw the mask aside\\" and to stop writing under pseudonyms or responding in his previous manner. The prologue was not allowed to be performed with The Mock Doctor from an order by the Lord Chamberlain's office after it almost caused a riot, but it was printed in the Public Advertiser.Poetical Works p. 447 Regardless, once the prologue was actually published, Smart gave up his career in satirical writing. Soon after, Smart's works in The Midwife, and other papers in which he Smart contributed under a pseudonym, were soon discontinued and his major source of income was ended. There was very little contemporary reaction to follow, as Smart seemed to have disappeared from all mention. Later, in 1999, Bertelsen emphasized the importance of Smart's The Hilliad by claiming it as the \\"loudest broadside\\" during the \\"paper war\\". Likewise, Bertelsen was not afraid to point out Smart's gain at Hill's expense when he claims Hill was sent \\"sinking down to posterity in the canon of one of the more important poets of the eighteenth century.\\" See also * John Hill * Paper War of 1752‚Äì1753 * The Hop-Garden Notes References * Bertelsen, Lance. \\"'Neutral Nonsense, neither False nor True': Christopher Smart and the Paper War(s) of 1752-53.\\" In Christopher Smart and the Enlightenment, edited by Clement Hawes, 135-52.

Written in 1827‚Äì1828 and first published in 1837, the novel is the first prose work of the great Russian poet. Background Pushkin started to work on the novel towards the end of July, 1827 in Mikhailovskoye and in spring 1828 read some drafts to his friends, including poet Pyotr Vyazemsky. During Pushkin's lifetime, two fragments were published: in the literary almanac Severnye Tsvety (1829) and in the newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta (March 1830). All the extant parts were first published after Pushkin's death by the editors of the journal Sovremennik in 1837, who also gave the novel its current title. The main character of the novel, Ibrahim, is loosely based on Pushkin's maternal great-grandfather, Abram Petrovich Gannibal, a black African who was brought to Russia during the reign of Peter the Great. Pushkin's interests in history and genealogy combined to depict the transformation of Russia at the beginning of 18th century; the period of Russian history to which Pushkin returns in the narrative poem Poltava in 1829. The influential Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky maintained that \\"had this novel been completed... we should have a supreme Russian historical novel, depicting the manners and customs of the greatest epoch of Russian history.\\" The reasons why Pushkin left the novel unfinished are not known and no outline in Pushkin's hand has survived to show how he intended to develop the plot. According to a friend of Pushkin, A. Wulf: \\"The main intrigue of the novel, as Pushkin says, will be the sexual infidelity of the Moor's wife, who gives birth to a white child, and is punished by being banished to a convent.\\" (A.S. Pushkin v vospominaniyah sovremennnikov, Moscow, 1950, pp. 324‚Äì325). Plot summary The novel opens with a picture of morals and manners of the French society of the first quarter of 18th century; with the Moor's life in Paris, his success in French society, and his love affair with a French countess. But \\"summoned both by Peter and by his own vague sense of duty\\" Ibrahim returns to Russia. The following chapters, full of historical color and antiquarianism, sketch the different strata of the Russian society: ball at the Winter Palace and boyars' dinner at the boyar Gavrila Rzhevsky's place. The latter is interrupted by the arrival of the Tsar, who wants to marry Ibrahim to the Gavrila's daughter, Natalia.

The comic was compiled into a graphic novel, and released online as a motion comic. It is a prequel to the 2008 survival horror video game of the same name, detailing the five weeks leading up to the destruction of a space colony on the planet Aegis VII following the discovery of an artifact called the Marker. The comic series began production during development of the video game as part of Electronic Art's multimedia expansion of the plot referred to by staff as \\"IP cubed\\". Reception of the comic series has been generally positive, with several journalists praising its writing and artwork. All issues ranked in the top 300 sales charts compiled by Diamond Comic Distributors; the first issue sold over 6000 copies, while subsequent issues saw sales of between 3000 and 5000 copies during their publication months.  Publication history  The survival horror video game Dead Space began production in 2006 at EA Redwood Shores, based on creator Glen Schofield's wish to create the most frightening horror game possible. Alongside the game, the universe of Dead Space was expanded into a multimedia narrative described as \\"IP cubed\\"; it extended across the game, the animated movie Dead Space: Downfall, and the limited comic series. While each part of the media expansion was handled by different people, the game's development team acted as overall controller, ensuring continuity between each property. The comic was written by Antony Johnston, who was later one of the scenario writers for the video game. Johnson was well known at the time for his work on both original series such as Wasteland, and adaptations including graphic novels of the Alex Rider novels by Anthony Horowitz. The series was illustrated by Ben Templesmith, who had gained fame for his work on Wasteland, Fell and 30 Days of Night. Johnston was recommended to the project by Warren Ellis, who also served as one of the game's writers. He was first attracted to the project due to its focus on psychological horror over gore, comparing it to his favorite video game Silent Hill. The job was settled once Johnston and the game's publisher Electronic Arts were in agreement on the direction of the project. Johnston described the whole process up to the contract stage as \\"a bit of a whirlwind\\". The storyline used multiple points of view from different to tell its story, an approach inspired by its location on a human colony. He estimated that around 80 to 90% of the comic was standalone, with the remaining percentage linking back into the game. Both properties were separate so people could enjoy them independently, though the wider backstory elements were present across all media to establish continuity. Templesmith was brought on board by Johnston; Johnston believed Templesmith's art best suited the visual direction the team wanted to use for the comic. The two had previously collaborated on Wasteland and an untitled experimental comic in the early 2000s. Johnston and Electronic Arts approached Templesmith separately, and he accepted. The overseeing team did not try to keep the presentation uniform across all media, and while Templemith was given design guidelines he was otherwise allowed to draw the comic as he liked. As with 30 Days of Night, he used of color coding for different scenes and moods; the planet surface used blue-grey, while the colony interior used warmer shades. Its dark tone partially arose from its horror roots, as more traditional comic artwork‚Äîusing high lighting and color use‚Äîwould lessen that aspect. He visited the development team to view their Necromorph designs, choosing ones he liked to incorporate into the narrative. The comic was announced in February 2008 as part of the collaboration between Electronic Arts and American publisher Image Comics. The first issue released on March 3, with a limited edition with alternate cover art released as a signed giveaway at that year's WonderCon. The sixth and final issue released during mid-September. In December, as part of their collaboration with Image Comics, website Newsarama digitally published the first issue for free. It was released as a graphic novel by Titan Books on February 5, 2013. The graphic novel included a standalone comic, originally written to promote the spin-off game Dead Space: Extraction. This comic was again written by Johnston and illustrated by Templesmith. The comic series was adapted into a motion comic, released through the game's website between April and October 2008. The comic series was also included as an unlockable extra in Dead Space: Extraction.  Plot  The plot of Dead Space takes place in the year 2508, centuries after humanity narrowly extinction due to resource depletion by \\"cracking\\" planets to extract their resources in a three-year process. The story begins during the second year of an illegal mining operation on the planet Aegis VII funded by the Unitology religious movement. The colonists on Aegis VII discover a monolith-like artifact on Aegis VII they identify as a Marker, an object sacred to the Unitologists' beliefs. In reality, the Marker is a copy of an alien object that begins to have a fatal influence over the colony; this culminates in the colony's destruction by reanimated mutated corpses referred to outside the comic as \\"Necromorphs\\". The comic opens with a video log from Sergeant Abraham Neumann of the colony's P-SEC security, advising anyone still alive to nuke the planet. The story then jumps back five weeks to shortly after the Marker's discovery. While the colony was previously stable, the Marker's discovery prompts a wave of unusual incidents; beginning first as prevalent insomnia and hallucinations, many colonists then display symptoms of paranoia and become murderously violent. One of the colonists attacks medical officer Tom Sciarello, killing his assistant in the process. The Unitologists in the colony exacerbate the situation, as they attempt to worship at the Marker site. One of their number is Neumann's P-SEC partner Vera Cortez, and her beliefs and gradual decline drive a wedge between them. Marla Janssen, another P-SEC officer, becomes fascinated by symbols on the Marker seen on a leaked video. The colony leader Hanford Carthusia is given orders from the Unitology Church to safeguard the Marker until their ship the Ishimura arrives. Between its discovery and the Ishimuras arrival, the situation deteriorates further; Sciarello treats a growing and increasingly severe outbreak of hysteria and paranoia on the colony, technician Cameron finds an unusual organic matter growing in the vent system, and one of the Marker security team Natalia Deshyanov kills a member of the relief crew after the Marker video leak and suffers a complete breakdown. Carthusia, under orders from the Church, refuses to act and instead brings the Marker into the colony preparatory to sending both it and the colony's recent dead to the Ishimura. The Marker's approach prompts a mass suicide of Unitologists, among them Cortez. When the Ishimura arrives, the Marker is transported up. Things seem to calm down, but the colonists' mental state further deteriorates and Cameron continues to find organic material in greater quantities. Deshyanov is now insane, writing the Marker symbols on her walls. Neumann shows the writing to Janssen, and she interprets the Marker symbols as a code similar to the structure of DNA. The Ishimura captain Benjamin Mathius refuses to allow any colonists‚Äîincluding Carthusia‚Äîaboard due to the deteriorating situation. Carthusia withholds the bodies of the suicides in response. At the moment of the planetcrack, the colony's power fails and communications shut down. Cameron is killed by a Necromorph in the vents, while Neumann finds Janssen before they discover the P-SEC staff slaughtered. Janssen reveals that the Marker symbols are code for a virus that infects and mutates dead bodies. They are then attacked by the P-SEC bodies as they are changed into Necromorphs. The Necromorphs attack the colony, killing many including Carthusia and Sciarello and converting the suicides. The survivors' desperate attempts to escape result in an overloaded shuttle crashing into the shuttle bay, destroying the remaining shuttles. Neumann and Janssen head for the communication tower, but discover a mass of organic matter‚Äîincluding the converted body of Cortez‚Äîhas clogged the system. Janssen sacrifices herself to save Neumann from the Necromorphs. Deshyanov meanwhile leaves the colony for the planetcrack crater; seeing something in the crater, she jumps to her death. The story ends with Neumann concluding his video log; unhinged by recent events, he walks away from the camera telling whoever finds it not to look for him.  Reception  The first issue of Dead Space appeared in the top 300 best-selling comics for that month compiled by Diamond Comic Distributors, achieving sales of over 6,800 copies. The next four issues sold between 3000 and 5000 copies. The final issue sold over 4,300 copies. Critics generally praised the comic; a quote from Johnston's website taken from the media outlet Examiner.com praised its narrative delivery and depth. Reviewing the first issue, IGNs Richard George found both the artwork and the narrative overly derivative despite their combined strength. David Norman of website Clandestine Critic reviewed the graphic novel release. He enjoyed the slow build-up to the comic's finale, and noted that Templesmith's artwork helped reinforce the dark atmosphere. In his review of Dead Space: Extraction, The Daily Telegraphs Nick Cowen said the motion comic version was \\"narrated with some fantastic voice-acting\\". In a feature about the first issue's Newsarama publication, Ars Technicas Michael Thompson said that \\"the comics are excellent and feature an eerie and well-paced story\\", citing them as superior to the animated film Dead Space: Downfall.

In a similar article for PopMatters, David Main was far less positive, calling Johnston's narrative difficult to follow and faulting Templesmith's art as making all characters alike and being too cartoon-like for the levels of violence portrayed.

The station holds a long term community radio broadcasting licence and began broadcasting in September 2004. History 2YYY was formed by a group of local people in Young which was headed by the former General Manager of 2LF and 93.9 Star FM, Graham McDonald. The station's office and studios were originally located in the old TAB building in Cloete Street and the transmitter is located on Reservoir Hill, on the Cowra Road. In 2007, 2YYY applied to Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) for a permanent community radio licence which ACMA did not allocate to the station on grounds that 2YYY provided \\"insufficient evidence that the proposed service would meet the existing and perceived future needs of the community\\". ACMA also found that 2YYY failed to encourage community participation and exceeded ACMA limits on broadcasting sponsorship announcements. In 2008, Young and District Arts Council applied to ACMA for a community broadcasting license, whereupon ACMA tried to find agreement for bandwidth sharing with both 2YYY and the Arts Council, as they had failed to negotiate a mutually agreed time share arrangement. A proposed sharing arrangement by ACMA would see 2YYY broadcast for six months and the Arts Council acquiring the license for six months from 4 January. 27 June 2008, ACMA announced that Young District Arts Council Inc was issued a temporary community radio broadcasting licence and also announced that Lambing Flat Community Broadcasting Inc (LFCB) and Young District Arts Council Inc (YDAC) would be time sharing the 92.3 MHz frequency. LFCB would broadcast from 1 July 2008 until 3 January 2009 and YDAC to broadcast from 4 January 2009 until 30 June 2009. In July 2008 2YYY, under the management of a fully constituted Board of Management, moved to its present location at 44a Lovell St., Young (former T & D building). The station has since gone from strength to strength, and in early 2013, the ACMA offered 2YYY a long term licence; which was allocated to LFCBInc/2YYY in late September 2013. 2YYY continues to provide news, weather, and a wide variety of music to its listeners. All activities at 2YYY are performed by volunteer presenters; guided by a 7-person Board of Management. In August 2018 2YYY was granted renewal of a long term (5 years) broadcasting licence. 2YYY is run by a competent 7 member Board of Management and has 35 volunteers.

Truman (left) in 1948 India Edwards (June 16, 1895 ‚Äì January 14, 1990) was a United States Democratic politician and Vice Chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. She was an advocate for women in politics. She died at the age of 94 in Sebastopol, California. Her memoirs, Pulling No Punches, were published by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1977. Early years, family, and career Edwards was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1895, to John A. and India H. (Thomas) Gillespie and grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. She married for the first time in 1917 to Daniel Sharp, who died a year later in World War I. She married, secondly, in 1920, to investment banker Jack Moffet and had two children (John Holbrook Moffett, who died during WWII, and India Moffett Williams). Edwards started her career as a Chicago Tribune journalist and was society editor from 1918‚Äì36 and women's page editor from 1936-42. Edwards and Moffet divorced in 1937. In 1952, she married her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, who was employed by the State Department. She left the Tribune, and the couple moved to Washington, D.C.. Political career =Career with the Democratic Party= A party in Edwards' honor with, from left to right, Margaret Truman, Esther Tufty, India Edwards, Eda Brannan, and First Lady Bess Truman. Edwards' formal involvement with the Democratic Party began with her work as a volunteer during the 1944 Presidential election. She later occupied increasingly important position in the women's division of the party, serving first as executive secretary (1945‚Äì47), associate director (1947‚Äì48) and finally executive director (1948‚Äì53). In 1953, the women's division was integrated into the DNC; she was succeeded by Katie Louchheim. In 1950, Edwards was unanimously elected to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and occupied the vice-chair position from 1950 to 1956. Still, Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party politics for over thirty years throughout the careers of such politicians as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. =Truman campaigns and administration= Edwards accompanied President Harry Truman, who she deeply admired and was called her \\"political hero,\\" on his 1948 campaign tour; she was confident he would win, and Truman confided in her that he sometimes thought he and she were the only ones who believed he would win. Her influence over Truman caused him to appoint many women to prominent positions - Eugenia Anderson as United States Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as United States Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations, Eleanor Roosevelt as the head of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly, and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States. At the 1952 Democratic National Convention, her name was included, as a symbolic gesture, in the nominations for vice-president. She was the second woman honored in this way at a major party convention (Lena Springs being the first). She declined the nomination because she did not feel the time was right. Edwards explained how she increased the number of women in federal positions by saying, \\"Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.\\" References Category:1895 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Female candidates for Vice President of the United States Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Washington, D.C.

This level of tuition is not mandatory but most Trinbagonians start their children's schooling at this stage as children are expected to have basic reading and writing skills when they commence primary school. Students proceed to primary school at the age of five. Seven years are spent in primary school (beginning from infants 1). During the final year of primary school (standard 5), students prepare for and sit the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA), which determines the secondary school the child is to attend. For most children and parents, this is a very stressful period. Students attend secondary school for a minimum of five years and their first major exam is the local NCSE (National Certificate of Secondary Education) examinations, which is done in the third year of this system and administered by the Ministry of Education. The next major exam of the system which is done in the fifth year of school is CSEC (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate). Children with satisfactory grades may opt to continue high school for a further two-year period (6th form), leading to the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE). Both CSEC and CAPE examinations are held by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC). Public primary and secondary education is free for all, although private and religious schooling is available for a fee. Tertiary education Trinidad and Tobago offers free tertiary education to citizens up to the undergraduate level at accredited public and select private institutions. Both the Government and the private sector also provide financial assistance in the form of academic scholarships to gifted or needy students for study at local, regional or international universities.

Built in 1905, it is an architecturally distinctive local landmark, with an octagonal frame and a copper-domed roof. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The windmill is an octagonal wood-frame structure, resting on a concrete foundation, with a wooden shingled exterior and a copper-domed roof. Its base is flared, with the entrance projecting slightly on the west-facing facade, under a gabled pediment. There are four small windows in the structure, all at different heights to provide light to the inside staircase. At the top of its interior is an observation area, which is surrounded on the outside by a broad gallery supported by sawn brackets. The dome is topped by a spire, on which are mounted the rotating mechanism and carriage of the mill. The wheel has retained its spokes, but no longer has paddles to catch the wind. This mechanism was originally connected to a central shaft, now removed, that lead down to a shallow dug well. The shaft was protected from the stairs by a tongue-and-groove partition. The windmill was apparently built about 1905 on the farm of Benjamin and Chester Bailey, and is one of a very small number of agricultural windmills to survive in the state. It was apparently used by the Baileys and later owners until the 1920s, when the well pump was converted to gasoline power.

Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2001). Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor (2002). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 1996, the gross primary enrollment rate was 111.7 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 92.9 percent. Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Uruguay as of 2001.  Characteristics  Uruguay had the highest literacy rate in Latin America, at 96 percent in 1985. There was no appreciable difference in literacy rates between males and females, but there were discrepancies between urban and rural rates (rural rates being demonstrably lower). Uruguay's system of universal, free, and secular education required a total of nine years of compulsory school attendance, from ages six to fifteen. The proportion of children of primary school age enrolled in school had long been virtually 100 percent. Furthermore, from 1965 to 1985 the proportion of children of secondary school age enrolled in some form of secondary school grew from 44 to 70 percent, also the highest rate in Latin America. The postsecondary education enrollment rate was about 20 percent. Coeducation was the norm, and females and males attended school in near-equal numbers at all levels. As is typical of any country, however, rates of schooling were higher in urban areas than in rural areas. The quality of education in Uruguay was rated as high. Teaching was a socially respected profession and one that paid relatively well. Most teachers, trained in teachers' training colleges, were deemed well qualified. The main problem confronting the education system was the inadequacy of facilities, instructional materials, and teachers' aides. Rural areas often suffered from woefully insufficient facilities and supplies. Urban schools often were seriously overcrowded and were forced to resort to holding classes in multiple shifts. In addition, dropout and repetition rates, although moderate by Latin American standards, were still considered high.  Primary education  State Primary School students in Uruguay with XO computers Primary education in Uruguay was free and compulsory; it encompassed six years of instruction. The number of primary schools in 1987 was 2,382, including 240 private schools. There were 16,568 primary school teachers and 354,179 primary school students. This resulted in a pupil-teacher ratio of approximately twenty-one to one in 1987, compared with about thirty to one in 1970. Boys and girls were enrolled in almost equal numbers.  Secondary education  General education in secondary schools encompassed six years of instruction divided into two three- year cycles. The first, or basic, cycle was compulsory; the second cycle was geared to university preparation. In addition to the academic track, public technical education schools provided secondary school education that was technical and vocational in nature. The two systems were parallel in structure, and there was little provision for transfer between the two. All sectors of society traditionally tended to prefer the academic course of study, which was regarded as more prestigious. As a result, academic secondary education had expanded more rapidly than technical education in the second half of the twentieth century. In 1987 there were 276 general secondary schools in Uruguay, including 118 private schools. However, the public high schools were much larger, so that in 1987 they actually contained 145,083 of the country's 175,710 secondary school students enrolled in both day classes and night classes. In addition, ninety-four technical education schools had a total enrollment of 52,766 students in 1987. Male and female enrollment at the secondary level was roughly equal, but females slightly outnumbered males overall (constituting, for example, 53 percent of the secondary school student body in 1982). It appeared that females were in the majority in the basic cycle but were very slightly outnumbered by males in the university preparatory cycle.  Higher education  University of the Republic Uruguay has only two public universities, the University of the Republic founded in 1849 and the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica del Uruguay founded in 2012, and four private universities; Universidad Cat√≥lica del Uruguay (www.ucu.edu.uy), Universidad ORT Uruguay (www.ort.edu.uy), Universidad de la Empresa (www.ude.edu.uy), and Universidad de Montevideo. Education at the University of the Republic was free and, in general, open to all those possessing a bachillerato, or certificate awarded for completion of both cycles of general secondary education. Despite the free tuition, however, access to a university education tended to be limited to children of middle and upper-income families because the need to supplement the family income by working, coupled with the expense of books and other fees, placed a university education out of the reach of many. Moreover, the fact that the only public university was in Montevideo severely limited the ability of those in the interior to attend university unless their families were relatively well off financially. In 1988 about 69 percent of university students were from Montevideo. The number of university students continued to grow rapidly, from nearly 22,000 in 1970 to over 61,000 in 1988. Of that total, women accounted for about 58 percent. Most courses of study were intended to last from four to six years, but the average time spent at university by a successful student was usually considerably longer. As in the rest of Latin America, maintaining the status of student had various advantages, such as reduced fares on buses and subsidized canteens. This was one reason that the student population was so large yet the number of graduates relatively low. In 1986 only 3,654 students (2,188 women and 1,455 men) graduated from university, whereas 16,878 entered that year. Uruguayans exhibited a strong preference for the disciplines and professions they deemed prestigious, such as law, social science, engineering, medicine, economics, and administration. Observers continued to note the discrepancy between university training and job opportunities, particularly in the prestigious fields. This gap contributed to the substantial level of emigration of the best-educated young Uruguayan professionals.  History  = Reforms under military rule, 1973‚Äì85 = In 1973, the year in which Uruguay descended into authoritarian rule, major changes were decreed in the education system. The National Council for Education (Consejo Nacional de Educaci√≥n‚ÄîConae) was set up to oversee all three branches of education under the supervision of the executive branch of government. At the same time, the compulsory length of schooling was raised from six to nine years. The secondary curriculum was completely reorganized, as was the pattern of teacher training. Finally, the INET saw its status and budget upgraded. However, overall spending on education fell from 12.2 percent of the central government budget in 1974 to 7.3 percent in 1982. Enrollments in primary education (both state and private) fell 6 percent from 1968 to 1981. From 1968 to 1982, secondary school enrollments grew 6 percent; however, about half the secondary school students in Montevideo (and 70 percent in the interior) dropped out before receiving any certification. Over the same period, there was a boom in technical schools; enrollments increased 66 percent in the interior and 27 percent in Montevideo. The major cause of this increase was the new ciclo b√°sico (basic cycle), which added three years of compulsory secondary education to the six years of compulsory primary schooling. However, the dropout rate remained about 50 percent. Enrollments in the University of the Republic doubled from 1968 to 1982, but the proportion of students graduating fell to just 8 percent. In 1984, as something of a parting shot, Uruguay's military government formally granted university status to a Catholic college that had been expanding over the previous decade. This ended the University of the Republic's monopoly, which had lasted since its foundation in 1849. The new Catholic University of Uruguay remained extremely small, however, compared with its rival. =Recent years= Uruguay, under the initiative of President Tabar√© V√°zquez approved and implemented the program called Ceibal project, which is currently running successfully, providing all Primary School children with their own \\"ceibalita\\"; as the laptops are affectionately called. In 2010, with the new government of Jos√© Mujica Cordano, the program will continue, and is planned to be extended to cover all secondary education children as well. The laptops were developed by a non-governmental organization, One Laptop Per Child (OLPC).http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14558609 Following the ideas of the OLPC, Uruguay was the first country in the world to commit itself and implement a plan to distribute personal computers to every student and teacher in the public education system, with the strategic purpose of improving educational quality in an equity framework.

It served a variety of roles (transport, minelayer, escort, gunboat) in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas as well as the English Channel and Norwegian coastal waters. Originally developed for the proposed invasion of England (Operation Sea Lion), the first of these ships was commissioned on 16 April 1941, with approximately 700 being completed by the war's end in May 1945. Allied sources sometimes refer to this class of vessel as a \\"Flak Lighter\\" or \\"F-lighter\\".Reynolds, Leonard C. Motor Gunboat 658: The Small Boat War in the Mediterranean 1955/2002. - several encounters with \\"F-lighters\\" during Dog 658's tour in the Med. Design and development Several Types (A-D) were developed, whose size and armament grew from Type to Type. Some specialised derivates such as artillery vessels and minelaying vessels were also built on the basis of these craft. They were not mainly used for their initial invasion role, but for transport and supply duties, escort and harbour protection. The MFPs were protected by 20 mm-thick steel armor plating.Robert Forczyk, We March Against England: Operation Sea Lion, 1940‚Äì41, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, p. 300 =Type A= This first version of the MFP was to be of all- welded construction in order to save weight. But a shortage of skilled welders meant that only the original prototype, F100, was built in this fashion. All following examples featured extensive riveting. The MFP-A's original intended power plant was to be two 600 hp 6-cylinder surplus BMW aircraft engines and one 6-cylinder Deutz diesel truck engine. Operating with all three engines at full throttle, the MFP-A could make 13 knots. But the BMW aircraft engines proved mechanically trouble-prone and used excessive amounts of fuel and it was decided to install a standard set of three Deutz diesel truck engines instead. Though this reduced the vessel's maximum speed to 10.5 knots, the loss of speed was more than offset by the power plant's greater reliability and more economical cruising range. =Type A1= German MFPs like this one were transferred to the Mediterranean to supplement Italian-built landing craft intended for the invasion of Malta. These were intended for use in Operation Herkules, the planned but never-executed Italo-German invasion of Malta. Ten of them were specially modified to each carry a captured Russian KV-1 or KV-2 heavy tank. This required strengthening and widening of the well decks and internal ramps and outward repositioning of the bow ramp counterbalance weights in order to accommodate these vehicles. =Artillerief√§hrprahm (AFP)= The Artillerief√§hrprahm or AFP (Artillery Ferry) was a gunboat derivative of the MFP. These ships were used for escorting convoys, shore bombardment and minelaying. They were fitted with two 88mm guns and light AA guns.german-navy.de =Motozattera (MZ)= In preparation for its proposed invasion of Malta, Operazione C3, the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) secured design plans from the Kriegsmarine for the MFP-A in late 1941 and placed an initial order for 65 vessels, numbered 701 through 765. These motozattere (or Bette MZ as they were officially designated) were built in Italian shipyards, primarily in and around Palermo, and gave the Italian Navy the necessary amphibious capability to land infantry, armored vehicles and supplies directly onto an open beach. Up to three M13/40 medium tanks and 100 fully equipped infantrymen could be carried or an equivalent weight in cargo. The only major design changes were to substitute Italian-made diesel engines (OM BXD 150 hp six-cylinder types as used in the Littorina diesel trains) for the German powerplant of three Deutz truck engines and to replace the German-made 7.5 cm deck gun with a 76 mm/40 quick-firing Italian gun. The first motozattera was laid down in March 1942. By July of that year, the month slated for the Malta invasion, all 65 MZs had been completed and were ready for deployment. On 27 July, however, the invasion was indefinitely postponedHeckmann, p. 283 and many Italian MZs were diverted to the task of ferrying supplies from Italy to Libya and between ports along the Libyan coast in order to support Panzerarmee Afrika's advance into Egypt. In September 1942, 40 additional MZs (761-800) were ordered. This modified version featured a raised bow to improve sea-keeping, a strengthened keel, larger fuel tanks for increased range, a lining of concrete ‚Äúarmor‚Äù 100mm thick for anti-splinter protection and a second 20mm AA gun mounted amidships. A third series of 40 MZs was ordered in June 1943 but none were ever completed. A further 20 examples (MZ 801-820) were also planned, being an exact copy of the MFP-D (including the same engines and armament), but this too never materialized as by then the war situation for Italy had worsened considerably and her armed forces had been expelled from North Africa. In all, 95 motozattere were built in Italian shipyards prior to Italy‚Äôs signing of an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943.Marcon, p. 221-224 Operations The first use of the Marinef√§hrprahm was during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Twelve Marinef√§hrpr√§hme were deployed during Operation Beowulf II as part of the German invasion of Saaremaa, Hiiumaa and Muhu on 14 September 1941. The Marinef√§hrprahm provided logistical support during the siege of Sevastopol in June 1942. Twenty-four Marinef√§hrpr√§hme from 1. Landungs-Flotille transported a Kampfgruppe from the 46th Infantry Division across the Kerch Strait to the Taman Peninsula as part of Operation Bl√ºcher II on the night of 2 September 1942. Between January and October 1943, Marinef√§hrpr√§hme were used to evacuate the Wehrmacht's 17th Army from the Kuban bridgehead on the Taman Peninsula in southern Russia despite repeated Soviet attacks during this period. The sea evacuation brought out 239,669 soldiers, 16,311 wounded, 27,456 civilians and 115,477 tons of military equipment (primarily ammunition), 21,230 vehicles, 74 tanks, 1,815 guns and 74,657 horses to the Crimea. In February 1944, three MFPs were purchased by the Romanian Navy, being renamed PTA-404, PTA-405 and PTA-406.Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond StƒÉnescu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ in al doilea rƒÉzboi mondial: 1942-1944, FƒÉt-Frumos Publishing, 1996, p. 236 (in Romanian) See also *Landing craft tank, an equivalent Allied naval class References Bibliography * Gabriele, Mariano.

For students ages two to five, there are preschools that are generally not state-funded until the year before elementary school. After preschool, parents are not charged for tuition, but they must provide, stationery, and food for their children. A number of private schools exist across the country, but these schools are largely financially inaccessible for most children. There is an ongoing national discussion regarding the introduction of tuition fees for university education. Elementary school is mandatory for children from ages six to fifteen. After that, some students leave formal education altogether, while other students attend a professional or vocational school. Enrollment in public schools is fairly high, though these figures do not document active student engagement. Attendance among Romani children is generally much lower than other Czech children due to their parents not sending them to school or an inability to speak the Czech language. Czech's education system is governed by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and had a budget of ‚Ç¨4.6 billion in 2016.  Elementary School  Elementary school () consists of nine grades grouped into two stages. = First Stage = The first stage covers the first five years of formal education. Classes are taught by a single teacher, although there is sometimes a separate foreign language or physical education teacher. The subjects taught are Czech and include one foreign language (usually English), mathematics, computer science, history, geography, science, art, music, physical education, and handcrafts. There is usually a first stage school in every village; in small villages, several grades may be taught in one class. = Second Stage = The next four years of elementary school form the second stage, the last compulsory stage in education. Subjects taught at this stage include Czech, literature, two foreign languages, mathematics, computer science, history, geography, civics, physics, biology, chemistry, music, art, physical education, and handcrafts. Some of these subjects are only mandatory in grades eight and nine. Students are either taught in the same elementary school as their first stage, or at an eight-year academy ()), or at a six-year academy (). Continuing at an elementary school is the most popular option today, and six-year academies are quite rare. Some eight-year academies have a specific physical education emphasis, and some six-year academies have their later years almost entirely taught in a foreign language. Grade levels in the eight-year academy are usually called by Latin numbers; year one is prima (the first in Latin), year two is sekunda, and so on.  Secondary School  Since the 2016/2017 school year, secondary schools that distribute students to a \\"maturita\\" degree upon graduation are required to set an entrance test in mathematics and the Czech language. This test is run by CERMAT, the government agency that also administers the maturita. Schools can also institute their own separate tests. = Vocational School = Vocational certificates are given after a two- or three-year course and a final exam, though there are different types of qualifications depending on the profession. There are also two-year vocational courses that do not offer a certificate. Some vocational schools offer an academic maturita qualification in addition to the vocational certificate allowing progression to university. These schools last four years like any other school offering the maturita, and the student must pass both sets of exams to graduate. = Professional school and Lyceum = A professional school lasts four years and awards a maturita qualification. There is a large variety of industrial and technical skills covered including technical chemistry, electrical engineering, agriculture, internet technology, or business. A lyceum is a professional high school that teaches a more general curriculum; academic subjects like history and geography are taught more thoroughly than in an ordinary professional school. Types of lyceum include technical, pedagogical, medical, scientific, and military (operated in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense). = Grammar school= Grammar school is either a continuation of an eight- and six-year academy or part of a four-year grammar school for elementary school graduates. Four-year grammar schools are either generally oriented or focus on physical or music education. The generally oriented grammar schools can decide on a specialization. The subjects are the same as in the second stage of elementary schools but are obligatory only in grade ten and eleven (mathematics also in grade twelve, Czech and two foreign languages until grade thirteen). Schools can make these subjects obligatory in the last two years of school, or the students can have more elective subjects than the legally required minimum. Grammar school graduates have no qualification; the aim of this type of school is a preparation for university studies. =Maturita Exam= Maturita is the name of the universal leaving qualification of four-year secondary schools and is a requirement for university studies and higher professional schools. It is made up of a number of subjects. Every student must take Czech language and world literature, consisting of a reading and grammar exam, a writing exam, and a literature oral exam. The second subject must be either mathematics or a foreign language (English, German, French, Spanish or Russian, including writing, reading, speaking and listening, to B1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). The exams for these mandatory subjects are standardized and set by CERMAT. The other two or three exams taken by the student at this time are dictated by the school. =Special and Practical Schools= Special schools for developmentally disabled children unable to participate in mainstream elementary education were once common in the Czech Republic. The subjects taught were very limited, meaning that leavers were logistically unable to continue on to all types of secondary education. A student required a reference from an educational psychologist and the agreement of parents to enroll in a special school. Special schools were replaced by elementary and practical schools, though the problem of the over- representation of Romani pupils continues. There are elementary practical schools usually taught in the same institution. These teach the equivalent of the first and second stages and one- to two-year secondary courses after the age of fifteen. The education is mainly practical to teach students to be self-sufficient. Meanwhile, \\"integrated education\\" of under-performing or mentally handicapped children in ordinary schools with the support of a special teacher is becoming more common.  Tertiary education  On April 7, 1348, Charles IV founded the first university in Central Europe - Charles University. The second university in present-day Czech Republic was established in 1576 (see Palack√Ω University, Olomouc) in an effort to counter weigh the influence of Protestants, who controlled the Prague University and who constituted about 90% of country's population. After the Czechoslovak state was established, a number of other universities were founded, such as Masaryk University-- the second largest university in the Czech Republic. = Higher professional schools = Higher professional schools (vy≈°≈°√≠ odborn√° ≈°kola, VO≈†) offer professional tertiary education and are usually connected with professional high schools. Before their graduation, students must take final exams (absolutorium) and write a final thesis. Graduates are entitled to use the honorific \\"DiS.\\" (diplomovan√Ω specialista, specialist with diploma) after their name. =Universities= People with MA degree in the most populated Czech cities Higher education in the Czech Republic consists of public and private universities, as well as state-run police and military training academies. Czech-language study at public universities is unlimited and free for first-time attendants; however after the age of 26, the attendant will not receive student status from social services and the individual's health insurance will not be state-funded. Czech public universities also host international students, who have the choice of free instruction in Czech or paid instruction in English. For private universities, annual tuition is between 2,000 and 3,000 euro and for BSBA and MBA (not accredited by Ministry of Education) study programs cost between 3,000 and 10,000 euro. The perceived quality of education at public universities is higher than private institutions, as private universities have undergone many scandals in recent years. :For an example of a Czech public university governance, see Governance of Palack√Ω University. University education takes from 2 to 6 years, depending on the degree of studies: *Bachelor's degree programs - lasts usually 3 years, title Bc. (bakal√°≈ô) or BcA. (bakal√°≈ô umƒõn√≠) (only artistic fields of study), Maturita level is required. Students must pass final exam (st√°tn√≠ zkou≈°ka, state exam - despite its name, this exam is not organized by state, but by universities themselves; at some universities required only if the student did not have good grades during his studies) and present their thesis. *Master's degree programs - Bachelor's degree required, except of law, pharmacy, dentistry and 1st stage teaching (5 years programs, maturita required) and medicine (6 years programs, maturita required). They are finished by final exam (st√°tn√≠ zkou≈°ka, for medicine st√°tn√≠ rigor√≥zn√≠ zkou≈°ka) and thesis presentation. Awarded titles: **Mgr. (magistr) **MgA. (magistr umƒõn√≠) - for artistic fields of study **Ing. (in≈æen√Ωr) - for technical and economical fields of study **Ing. arch. (in≈æen√Ωr architekt) - architecture **MUDr. (medicinae universalis doctor) - medicine **MVDr. () - veterinary medicine **MDDr. (medicinae dentium doctor) - dentist *Doctor study programs, Ph.D. title These titles are granted after a special exam (rigor√≥zn√≠ zkou≈°ka), which contains a thesis presentation. A master's degree is required to write this exam.

Calendar The school year starts on the first weekday of September and ends on the last weekday of June. It is divided into two semesters with exams at the end of each. Usually, the first semester runs from 1 September to 30 January, and the second from 1 February to 30 June, separated by a one-day break and the summer holidays. The actual dates, along with holidays and breaks, are announced by each school individually and may vary slightly. =Holidays= *autumn holidays - two working days around Independent Czechoslovak State Day (28/10), which is a public holiday *Christmas (winter) holidays - about 9 ‚Äì 12 days (usually 22/12 - 2/1, ends with first Sunday after new year) *mid-term break - one-day holiday (1/2) *spring holidays - one-week holiday with the date varying according to the district (usually from the beginning of February until the end of March) *Easter holidays - three-day holiday (called Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Monday) *summer holidays - sixty-two-day+ holiday (1/7 - 31/8 plus days from last Friday in June to first Monday in September, which starts a new school year) There is also Children's Day on 1 June, which is not considered a holiday, but children are usually taken on (school) trips (one day or more) and other cultural activities.

Ross Island is the main island of a four- island cluster in the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The islands, covering a total of about , are owned mainly by Ross Island Sand and Gravel (RISG), which mined them extensively between 1926 and 2001. The other three islands are Hardtack, East, and Toe. Ross Island was named for Oregon pioneer Sherry Ross. The islands split the Willamette River into Holgate Slough on the east. They are about south of downtown Portland at river mile 15, the islands are slightly upriver (south) of the Ross Island Bridge between the Springwater Corridor Trail on the eastern shore and the South Waterfront on the western shore and slightly downriver from the Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore and Willamette Park on the western shore. Ross is the longest of the islands, the closest to the western shore, and the closest to the Ross Island Bridge. Hardtack is to its east. East Island lies southeast of Hardtack, and Toe Island lies southwest of Ross. No bridge reaches the islands, which are approached only by boat. Ross Island is connected to Hardtack Island by an artificial levee built in 1926 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in order to form a lagoon between the two islands. The lagoon made dredging easier for RISG and diverted water west of the islands, where it deepened a shipping channel. In 2007, the owner of RISG, Robert B. Pamplin, Jr., donated of the island to the city of Portland, which plans to manage the property as a natural area. The islands, which retain remnants of forested riparian zones, are used by at least 50 species of birds including ospreys, eagles, herons. The gift was accepted long after transfer negotiations stalled in 2002 over questions of liability for the islands' restoration and cleanup. Because it contains toxic fill dirt, the Ross- Hardtack lagoon is listed for cleanup by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. City staff and outside experts who inspected the in 2007 approved of their condition. In addition to the gifted acres and the still owned by RISG, the Port of Portland owns .

History By the late 1980s, under Benin's Marxist government, the quality of education was seriously eroded. By 1989, the education system was in a state of collapse. A key event in the reform of education in Benin was the national Conference on Education (Etats G√©n√©raux de l'Education, EGE) held in 1990 which adopted a national policy and strategy to improve education. Beginning in 1991, the government of Benin introduced significant changes in the Beninese education system. Major advances have been made in education, especially in the areas of access and teaching/learning conditions. The gross enrollment rate has increased from a base of 49.7% in 1990 to 96% in 2004 and girls' enrollment from 36% in 1990 to 84% in 2004.

This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. * Primary school: 6 years * Junior high school: 4 years * Senior high school: 3 years * Bachelor's degree: 3 years * Master's degree: 4 years Education is compulsory for children between ages six and eleven. After spending two to three years in kindergarten, it takes six years for them to complete and take the primary school certificate. It requires seven years to complete junior and senior high school. At the end of the four first years of junior high school, the students have to take the O-level (Brevet d‚ÄôEtudes du Premier Cycle: BEPC). After three years the students have to take the A level (Baccalaur√©at: BAC) exam which is the equivalent of the U.S. high school diploma. There are vocational schools in the following provinces: Atlantique littoral (city of Cotonou), Oueme Plateau (city of Porto-Novo), Zou Colline (city of Bohicon) Borgou (city of Parakou), Mono Couffo, Atakora, Donga and Alibori.

In 2015, public expenditure amounted to 4.4% of GDP, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Within total education expenditure, Benin devotes quite a large share to higher education: 0.97% of GDP in 2015. Between 2009 and 2011, the share of young people enrolled at university rose from 10% to 12% of the 18-25 age cohort, one of the highest ratios in West Africa. Student enrollment in tertiary education doubled between 2006 and 2011 from 50,225 to 110,181. These statistics encompass not only bachelor's, master's and PhD programmes but also non-degree post-secondary education.

Its name derives from the word \\"Bapu\\", which refers to Gandhi, who was popularly called \\"Bapu\\", or Father.  History  Bapunagar was established in the early 1960s, in the vicinity of the city of Ahmedabad, as a residential area for the poor mill workers, when Ahmedabad was a flourishing textile centre in India. Many of these mills had closed by the late 1980s, reducing the now unemployed mill workers to home businesses, such as making incense sticks or candles. The present day detergent giant Nirma ‚Äì started from Ambica Society located in the compound of Navlakha Bungalow began as just one such home industry; the owner started by making household detergents and selling them door to door. Navlakha Bungalow which is believed to be built around 1922 is now a Heritage Building, in Year 1966 in this Bungalow Late Mr.S.K.Varma and Late Mr.R.S.Varma established a Trust under which they started a School to provide better education to children of Bapunagar, students from more than 10 km away used to come to this school, the school named \\"Shri Jivan Sadhana Higher Secondary School\\" is now 50 Years old and going strong and is well known for giving best education at a very low fees amount in whole Bapunagar.  Industry and business  In the early 1990s, diamond cutting arose as an industry in the absence of the textile mills. At present, Bapunagar ranks second in India as a diamond cutting centre, after only Surat. Diamond cutting has absorbed many of the workers who used to be employed by textile mills, and attracted additional people from the Saurashtra. This influx of new residents caused a resultant increase in the housing sector and construction is causing a second more recent employment boom. Bapunagar Darpan is local bi-weekly newspaper operated from Bapunagar, Ahmedabad.  Landmark  Maleksaban, or Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, was the first sports stadium in Ahmedabad, but due to insufficient use and funding, it was converted into a sports complex, Sardar Patel Stadium. It is occasionally used for military drills and informal cricket games. Built in the 1450s, Malik Saban Roza is now home to many. Encroachers have connected sandstone pillars with brick walls to demarcate their spaces, robbing the roza of its magnificent beauty. Vijay Chowk is a square which divides the old and new portions of Bapunagar, and serves as a site for political gatherings and speeches, particularly when election campaigns are underway. The city also serves as a source of agricultural products such as mangoes and chilis. Diversity Bapunagar has a diverse population, but is nicknamed \\"Mini- Saurashtra\\", as majority of its population have roots in the Amreli, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Jamnagar and other districts of the Saurashtra region of Gujarat. This area is considered communally sensitive and has witnessed some of the worst post-independence violence, primarily struggles between the Hindu majority and the Muslim minority. The 1969 riots were the worst riots of that period, with about 1,100 lives lost, and the 2002 riots in 2001 took about 300 lives. The VHP leader Pravin Togadia started his professional as well as political career from here. This area has seen significant commercial growth in the wake of the revived diamond cutting and construction industries. Bapunagar also has a sizeable population of out of state immigrants from Up, Rajasthan and From Maharashtra. Many of the local retailers, franchises, restaurants and other businesses have observed the significant development that has taken place in the last decade. The general consensus being that to restore the branch in Bapunagar would be a benefit for all. Bapunagar also now has some huge multi-specialty hospital units like \\"Sardar Hospital\\" and \\"Kakadia Hospital\\" and some decent sized health clubs/gymnasiums and a multi- sports ground. The state-of-the-art ESIC (Employees State Insurance Corporation) hospital is also situated on Stadium Road. Just like rest of Ahmedabad, Bapunagar too has significant levels of atmospheric pollution, some very bad traffic problem and is in urgent need of attention from authorities. This is also one of the fastest-developing areas of the city. Bapunagar is surrounded by areas like Odhav, Saraspur, Naroda, Gomtipur,  References  Category:Neighbourhoods in Ahmedabad Category:Cities and towns in Ahmedabad district ","title":"Bapunagar"},{"id":"18102944","text":"Structural steel pipe racks typically support pipes, power cables and instrument cable trays in petrochemical, chemical and power plants. Occasionally, pipe racks may also support mechanical equipment, vessels and valve access platforms. Main pipe racks generally transfer material between equipment and storage or utility areas. Storage racks found in warehouses are not pipe racks, even if they store lengths of pipe.Drake, Richard M., P.E., S.E., SECB and Walter, Robert J., P.E., S.E. A pipe rack is the main artery of a process unit. Pipe racks carry process and utility piping and may also include instrument and cable trays as well as equipment mounted over all of these. Pipe racks consist of a series of transverse bents that run along the length of the pipe system, spaced at uniform intervals typically around 20 ft. To allow maintenance access under the pipe rack, the transverse bents are typically moment frames. Transverse bents are typically connected with longitudinal struts. There are different types of pipes on the pipe rack. Utility pipes which include steam, cooling water, extinguishing water, fuel oil, and so on. These pipes are mostly located in the middle of a one-level pipe rack or on the top level when there are two levels. Then there are the process pipes. These pipes carry product that is part of the chemical reaction itself. These are placed on the outside of the utility pipes (especially if they are heavy) or on the bottom level when there are multiple levels. Lastly, relief and flare pipes which fulfill a safety goal.

Its literacy rate as of 2010 ranges from 75 to 80% and being the highest in the whole of West Africa south of the Sahara. Although most children have access to education, some problems remain. For example, many students and some teachers speak Cape Verdean Creole at home and have a poor command of Portuguese (the language of instruction); there is insufficient spending on school materials, lunches, and books; and there is a high repetition rate for certain grades. History For much of the nineteenth century, education in Cape Verde was primarily undertaken at the initiative of private individuals or groups at a local level, rather than state organisation. The first government-funded primary school was established on the islands of Brava, Cape Verde in 1847. The first secondary school was set up, in Praia in 1860, but this school closed after a year. In 1866, a clergy- run Christian seminary named the Semin√°rio-Liceu was started in S√£o Nicolau, primarily to train priests, although not all students were ordained. The curriculum covered mathematics, science, classical languages and European literature. In 1917 the Semin√°rio-Liceu was replaced by the Liceu Nacional de Cabo Verde D. Infante Henrique , which was established in Mindelo on the island of S√£o Vicente. First housed in what is now the Centro Nacional de Artesanato e Design,G√©nese e desenvolvimento da cidade do Mindelo: a preserva√ß√£o de uma identidade, Fred Yanick Fonseca Delgado, 2016 it moved to the Liceu Velho building in 1921.

On a classical organ the device may be referred to as a drawstop solenoid. The SAM can be considered an electrical relay, the difference being that the SAM also has a drawknob or a tab, which enables it to be operated manually as well as electrically. A SAM will have an armature which is operated by an electrically induced magnetic field and dependent on whether the SAM is being used with a drawknob or a tilting tablet on a classically voiced organ or with a flat tab on a theatre organ, the armature will move in either a linear fashion or with semi-circular movement, in a small defined arc. A drawknob or tab is attached to the armature to facilitate hand operation. Each SAM consists of two coils of wire, wound on bobbins, which surround a single central, magnetically conductive pole piece or two separate pole pieces (determined by the designer) and will have one or more switching contacts or reed switches that are switched on or off by the movement of the armature. The switching contact is used to control which rank or ranks of pipes will sound when keys on a keyboard are depressed, although the actual 'rank switching' is often handled by a more complex electromagnetic or electronic relay system. In mechanical operation using a SAM with a drawknob attached, a player will either pull the drawknob towards themselves to select an 'on' state, or push the drawknob away to select an 'off' state. The movement of the drawknob affects the state of the switch or reed contact. Similarly, with a SAM that utilises a tilting tablet, the player will tilt the tablet up or down by hand to operate it. With a theatre organ the tab attached to each SAM is raised or lowered by the player to operate the switch contact/s. Whilst hand registering the organ is often carried out, this can only be used to facilitate small changes in the overall tonal colour, due to physical restrictions. i.e. The operator cannot operate more than one or two devices simultaneously, especially when using only one hand for registration, whilst playing keys with the other hand! This is where the true versatility of the SAM comes into play. By applying a low voltage electric current (usually between 12 and 30 volts at up to 0.5 ampere) to one or the other of a SAM's electromagnets (coils) the armature can be made to follow the same movement and thus operate its switching contact/s as if it had been actuated by a human operator. The advantage of electrical operation being that many SAMs can be electrically connected together and switched by the use of a single button (piston) depressed by the human player using only one finger. It can therefore be seen that operating many SAMs in simultaneous combination will have a far greater instantaneous effect on the sound of the organ (which is essential for tonal variety) than is achievable by the use of single SAMs. Furthermore, combinations of registration changes can be stored in electronic or electromechanical memory which forms part of the organ's combination action, for instant recall at the touch of a button (piston) and translated into electrical impulses used to operate multiple SAMs. One further use of SAMs in multiples is to achieve instant cancellation of organ registrations either in banks or for the entire organ. Most organs will have a General Cancel button for the purpose of entire cancellation, whilst at least one style of pipe organ manufactured by the John Compton company in the 20th century uses an ingenious system known as Second Touch Cancel, where each SAM has an extra contact fitted which is operated by depressing any single SAM's tab past its normal 'on' position, and which serves to switch all associated SAMs in its department to the 'off' position.

AIDS-related deaths have taken a heavy toll on teachers, contributing to the closure of more than 100 primary schools between 1996 and 1998. In 1991, the gross primary enrollment rate was 56.9 percent. In 2000, the net primary enrollment rate for children between the ages of 6 and 11 was 43 percent.

While enrollment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect children‚Äôs participation in school. There is not equal access to primary school for girls. For the first year of school, 65% of girls are enrolled in primary school. This dropped to 23% of girls after six years of primary school in 2007. Many girls drop out of school in their early teens due to societal pressures to marry and have children. The educational system‚Äôs meager budget and salary arrears have resulted in a shortage of teachers and an increase in the number of street children. The percentage of the national budget allocated to education, which traditionally stood at less than 12 percent, increased to 18 percent in the late 1990s. According to the government, it will further increase to 25 percent by 2010. There were 800,000 students that were affected by the violence that broke out in December 2012 due to the S√©l√©ka rebels.

Overview Djibouti is a small and resource- poor country of 23,200 square kilometers. The population is estimated at about 800,000, of which 87% live in urban areas. A poor pastoral and largely nomadic population sparsely occupies the hinterland, an extension of the deserts of Ethiopia and Somalia. Djibouti's population is young. About 40% of population is under age 15, and only 15% is over age 40. According to UNDP, Djibouti ranked 149th in Human Development Index in 1992. Djibouti's education system is not on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) although Djibouti has expanded its access to education. Illiteracy is an especially severe problem. About 70% of the total population and 85% of women are not literate. There are also large inequalities in access to education in regions, gender, and income levels. Moreover, the education system in Djibouti is very costly due to high unit costs for school construction, learning and teaching materials, and teacher salaries. By this high-cost structure, the achievements of the education-related MDGs are uncertain. Moreover, pressures on the education system will intensify because of steady demographic growth (population growth rate is estimated at 2.4%) and increased demand for quality of education. Since the Medium-term Plan 2000‚Äì2005 and the New Education Law were implemented, Djibouti has achieved significant progresses at all levels of education as they have internally and externally mobilized resources for the financing of construction, equipment purchases, and teacher recruitment. Education system The education system in Djibouti was originally developed to meet a limited demand for education; it was essentially designed for elites and borrowed heavily from the French system (administrative structure and pedagogical methods). This system was not adapted to the country's realities. Although the government effort resulted in an increase in enrollment during the 1990s, the education system is still below people's expectations and the needs of a developing nation. A restructured education system by the New Education Law consists of nine years (five years of primary education followed by four years of middle education). This nine year education is now compulsory. To enter into the secondary educational system of three years, a Certificate of Fundamental Education is required. The New Education Law has also introduced vocational education in secondary level and has established university facilities in Djibouti. There are 81 public primary schools, 24 registered private primary schools, 12 secondary schools, and two vocational schools in Djibouti. Government reform In 1999 the government revisited its education policies and launched a consultative process, National Education Forum (Etats G√©n√©raux de l‚ÄôEducation), which included all stakeholders (administration, teachers, parents, national assembly, and NGOs). Facing challenges of extremely low enrollments, internal and external inefficiencies, gender and socio-economic inequities, high unit costs and a skewed expenditure structure toward teacher wages, the forum set out an ambitious reform program, aiming to develop an education system that is efficient, financially viable, and responsive to the country's development needs. Building on the consensus and the recommendations, the government developed a Ten-Year Perspective Plan (Sch√©ma Directeur 2000-2010). In August 2000, the government passed a New Education Law (Loi d‚Äôorientation du syst√®me √©ducatif) and prepared the Medium- Term Plan 2000-2005 (Plan d‚Äôaction √† moyen terme). The reform initiative sought to improve the quality of instruction, to increase the role of parents and communities, to introduce competency-based approaches to student learning, and to strengthen the capacity of private and non-formal system to reach youth who were not enrolled, especially girls. Government strategy covers basic education, vocational education, secondary education, higher education, adult education and, in particular, women's literacy. Education finance Public education expenditure as percentage of GDP was 8.6 in 2007, and public expenditure as percentage of government spending was 22.8 in 2007. Share of public expenditure for primary education as percentage of total public education expenditure was 19.0 in 2007. In Djibouti, households play an important part in the financing of education services. Households contribute to education services in two ways: They pay tuition in private schools, and some households spend on books and other pedagogic materials. Education system =Pre-primary= Pre-primary education is a two-year education and the first stage of basic education. In pre-primary education, 688 male and 613 female were enrolled in 2008. Gross enrollment rate in pre-primary education was 3.2% for total, 3.3% for males and 3.0% for females in 2008. Gender parity index for gross enrollment rate in pre-primary education was 0.91 in 2008. Private enrollment share in pre-primary education was 89.0% in 2008. =Primary= Primary education is a five-year education and the second stage of basic education. In primary education, 30,165 male and 26,230 female were enrolled in 2008. Gross enrollment rate in primary education was 55.5% for total, 58.9% for male, and 52.1 for female in 2008. Gross enrollment rate has significantly improved (gross enrollment rate in 2000 was 32.5% for total, 37.5% for male, and 27.4% for female). By constructing new schools and classrooms and offering ‚Äúschool cafeteria‚Äù and ‚Äúschool supplies‚Äù program, school access and retention by children, particularly for poor rural families, became easier. Gender parity index for gross enrollment rate in primary education was 0.88 in 2008. Private enrollment share in primary education was 13.6% in 2008. =Middle education= Middle education consists of four years. In middle education, 17,503 male and 12,448 female were enrolled in 2008. Gross enrollment rate in middle education was 37.0% for total, 42.9% for male and 31.0% for female in 2008. Gender parity index for gross enrollment rate in middle education was 0.72 in 2008. Private enrollment share of general education in middle education was 9.7% in 2008. =Secondary= General education of secondary education consists of three years. In secondary education, 6,905 male and 4,303 female were enrolled in 2008. Gross enrollment rate in secondary education was 19.1% for total, 23.3% for male and 14.8% for female in 2008. Gender parity index for gross enrollment rate in secondary education was 0.63 in 2008. Private enrollment share of general education in secondary education was 22.9% in 2008. Technical secondary education lasts three years and vocational secondary education lasts two years. Private enrollment share of technical and vocational education was 10.7% in 2006. =Tertiary education= In tertiary education, 1,306 male and 886 female were enrolled in 2007. Gross enrollment rate in tertiary education was 2.6% for total, 3.1% for male and 2.1% for female in 2007. Gender parity index for gross enrollment rate in tertiary education was 0.69 in 2007. Challenges =Teacher quality= In Djibouti, teacher attrition is very high and new teachers are not recruited enough. In addition, the local teacher-training institute is unable to graduate more than 130 teachers per year. Notwithstanding shortage of trained teachers, historically, Djibouti always had a core of well-qualified trained teachers. Nearly all teachers in Djibouti are trained in the highly selective Personnel Training Center for National Education (Centre d‚ÄôEx√©cution des Projets education: CFPEN). Most teachers in primary education have a primary level certificate (61%) or a baccalaureat (33%). =ICT= Djibouti has yet to develop a sector-specific information and communication technologies (ICT) for education policy although ICT has been recognized as a critical tool in modernizing the education sector to meet the diverse human resource demand for the country. The ministry has prioritized capacity-building for teachers in the use of ICT through the National Education and ICT project and the automation of the ministry. The ministry managed to develop several ICT programs. Education Radio Program The National Education Production Information and Research Center develops educational content that is broadcast through Djibouti once a week through its School Radio project to increase access and to improve quality of education. These programs mainly cover secondary school subjects such as mathematics and science in French. Some of the programs are targeted to youth who do not enroll in schools. =Education for nomadic people= The nomadic population (the Afars and the Somalis) numbers 100,000, which represents one-sixth of the population in Djibouti. Participation rates in education in rural areas were very low (15% for boys and 8% for girls). Parents appear to be open to sending their children to school as they see a bleak future in animal husbandry. The school canteen is a motivation for nomadic families to send their children to school, especially in the poorer areas. =Education for All Fast Track Initiative= Although Djibouti has improved student access to schools, it is still not on track to meet the MDGs. Djibouti has been eligible for additional external funding, such as the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund. In the Middle East and North Africa region, Djibouti and Yemen are eligible. (See Education in Yemen.) Eight million USD were allocated in Djibouti, and US$8 million were all disbursed as of September 15, 2009. The Catalytic Fund is a multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank on behalf of donors. The purpose of the Catalytic Fund is to provide transitional financial assistance to FTI eligible countries. This fund was established in November 2003.

History  During the period of colonization, Equatorial Guinea's educational system was mostly controlled by Catholic missionary groups, in particular the Claretians. Schools run by the Spanish government encouraged the use of the Spanish language to communicate. During this period, school attendance was above 90%, which was one of the highest attendance rates on the continent.Norris, Carolyn. 2001. Equatorial Guinea: The Position of Refugees and Exiles in 2001 UNHCR. https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3dca82d32.pdf Upon independence, Equatorial Guinea also had one of the highest literacy rates on the continent. However, the educational system quickly deteriorated because there were fewer funds available. In addition to the lack of funding, the educational system suffered because President Mac√≠as viewed the Catholic church as a rival for power and as a symbol of Spanish imperialism. He made Catholic activities illegal in 1978 and closed down Catholic schools. As Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo took over the presidency, the education system stabilized. He placed a higher emphasis on the system by creating new schools and rehabilitating old ones.Bassett, L., Di Gropello, E., Marshall, J. H., & Tabares, J. A. A. (2017). Equatorial guinea education sector diagnostic. ().World Bank, Washington, DC. Retrieved from http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28327 Although the country's income rose after the discovery of oil deposits in the 1990s, Equatorial Guinea's budget still only allocated about 2-3 percent to health and education. This figure stands far below the Sub-Saharan average of 16% of government budget. The current education system is still quite new, as a 2007 law deemed education fundamental for all citizens and the country began to follow international standards.  Primary and Secondary Education  Primary education is for five years followed by four years of secondary in the first stage and three subsequent years of secondary education in the second stage. In 2001, about 35% of children between the ages of three and six were enrolled in some type of preschool program. It is estimated that about 45 percent of all students complete their primary education. The student-to-teacher ratio for primary school was at about 43:1 in 2000; the ratio for secondary school was about 23:1. The quality of schooling is low, along with poor outcomes. More than seventy percent of first grade students were classified as Low Achievement in 2011. Additionally, it is hard to track outcomes, as there are no national assessments.Bassett, L., Di Gropello, E., Marshall, J. H., & Tabares, J. A. A. (2017). Equatorial guinea education sector diagnostic. ().World Bank, Washington, DC. Retrieved from http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28327 The poor quality of schooling can be attributed to low teacher qualification levels, poor physical conditions, and lack of access to materials. There is also a high rate of grade repetition and dropout, as well as a lack of effective monitoring. Primary school is considered mandatory and is free of charge. Primary school enrollment has fallen over the past 30 years, with a peak of 177.582 percent gross enrollment in 1984 to the current gross enrollment rate of 61.775 percent. Nearly 45 percent of students drop out of primary school. At the primary school level, enrollment is relatively equal across different income quintiles. Upon completion of the primary level, students take a test to receive the Certification of Primary Studies, which determines whether a student should continue to the secondary level or opt for professional training. Secondary education is voluntary, covering six years. The majority of Equatoguineans do not receive secondary education. Access is much lower, and inequalities are evident, as the richest quintile is enrolled at four times the rate of the poorest. Currently, the Program for Education Development in Equatorial Guinea (PRODEGE), funded by President Obiang and Hess Corporation, is focused on improving the education of secondary students. This is part of the second phase of its ten-year plan.  Higher Education  Equatorial Guinea has placed a much larger emphasis on the funding of higher education than on the funding for primary and secondary schooling. In fact, the amount spent on higher education is fifty times that of primary education. Facilities for Equatorial Guinea's higher education are largely assisted by the Spanish National University of Distant Education. Equatorial Guinea's government boasts that more than 500,000 students received scholarships to study at universities, participate in professional training programs, and participate in technical training programs abroad over the past forty years. In order to be able to attend a university program, students must take a selectivity test.Bassett, L., Di Gropello, E., Marshall, J. H., & Tabares, J. A. A. (2017).

Introduction Classroom in thumb Lesotho spends a higher proportion of its GDP (13%) on education than any other country in the world . CIA World Factbook (2013). and an average child in Lesotho can expect to spend 10 years of their life in education.. CIA World Factbook (2013). Education is compulsory only between the ages of 6 and 13. Secondary school education is non-compulsory, and as of 2005 was attended by 24.0% of 13- to 17-year- olds.http://www.childinfo.org/files/ESAR_Lesotho.pdf There is a gender disparity present in secondary education, with more females attending than males. This disparity is greatest in wealthier areas, where males are 15.6% less likely than females to attend secondary school. Lesotho's educational system is organized in formal and informal domains. Lesotho contains a 3-7-3-2 formal education structure. Early childhood education is also known as pre- primary school in which students must pass 3 years before moving onto primary school. Primary school consists of seven grades (1-7) and upon completion receive the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) certificate that allows students to move onto secondary schools. There are two divisions within the secondary school known as the lower and Upper secondary. Lower secondary runs for three years (8-10) and upon completion are given the Junior Certificate (JC) and move onto grades 11-12. Lesotho's formal system has about 2,204 pre- primary schools, 1,478 primary schools, roughly 341 post-primary schools and 14 higher education institutions. Lesotho's informal domains comprises 26 technical and vocational schools that offer individuals training in automotive mechanics, bricklaying and home sciences. The informal education is set in place to address the educational needs for those who are unable to attend education through formal means while also providing primary and secondary education. Secondary education covers five years, three year junior secondary and a two-year senior secondary. One must pass the nationally administered Junior Certificate Examination to continue, before culminating in the external examination of the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (GCE \\"O\\" Level) that grants access to tertiary programs. Most university studies at the undergraduate level leading to a bachelor's degree takes four years to complete and masters programs typically take two years to complete. Education reforms Free primary education began to be introduced to Lesotho in the year 2000.http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/reducingpoverty/case/58/summary/East%20Afr%20Edu%20Summary.pdf Before that, many boys received no primary education at all and spent their time herding animals.\\"Lesotho\\" . 2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor (2002). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The adult literacy rate is higher for women (95%) than for men (83%). When free primary education was introduced, the government of Lesotho decided to phase it in gradually, with fee elimination beginning for the youngest children in the year 2000. In 2010, with primary school enrollment rates standing at 82%, an Education Act was introduced to make primary education not only free but also compulsory. While Lesotho does allocate over 23.3% of its budget on education, study in 2015 determined there were many challenges facing the educational sector. One such challenge includes poor retention rates at both primary and secondary levels. Other challenges included in the report are low student learning outcomes, high inefficiency in the system, and poor school governance. Many educational sectors also lack acceptable facilities and find it difficult to retain teachers, especially in mountainous districts or other areas where it is difficult to reach. As a result, Lesotho implemented the Educational Sector Strategic Plan for 2016-2026 to address these challenges. Lesotho's education plan for 2016‚Äì2026 is split into 13 chapters that cover an array of topics within the Ministry of Education and training. The plan not only serves as a blueprint for the Ministry's budget allocation for the decade but wants to focus on low performance in STEM subjects.  Female education  While it is common for education to favor males, especially in low-income countries, the gender gap in education tends to favor women in Lesotho. The ratio in enrollment rates in secondary education are 1.6 females for every male, making it the highest in the world. Female education comes from the result of male out-migration to South Africa due to high unemployment and poverty. This caused women to outnumber men by four-to-one while most of the most who migrated stayed in South Africa. Despite the high enrollment rates of women, girls in lower education, drop out rates remain high attributed to cultural, economic and social factors.  Challenges  While Lesotho's Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) introduced free primary education, many students with disabilities were excluded from education. In the 1990s, the ministry released their goals that would advocate for integrating people with disabilities. They include special education programs to help train teachers to particular set of students. With the passing of the Education Sector Strategic Plan in 2005, it targeted to significantly increase access for children with special educational needs (SEN) and promote more integration. There is still a shortage of qualified teachers in subjects such as science, math, business and technical topics. Universities Lesotho has two universities. Its main university is the National University of Lesotho, located in Roma, which has around 10000 registered students. The capital, Maseru, has been home to a campus of Limkokwing University since 2008.

However, few students go on to high school or university. The dropout rate is also very high particularly among primary school pupils. Primary education Primary school students at an outdoor meeting in Malawi Primarily schools are mostly in two categories of assisted (public) and unassisted (private) schools. Villages and hamlets throughout the country have such schools. By 1970, there were approximately 2,000 primary schools for 35 percent of primary school aged youth. About 12 percent of all primary school students attended private, predominantly church run schools. Secondary school education Secondary education developed late in Malawi, because of little effort or neglect in secondary education during the colonial era. Malawi has five types of secondary schools. These include aided boarding schools, aided day schools, government boarding-secondary schools, government day secondary schools, and private secondary schools. Most secondary teachers are qualified and hold either degrees or diplomas. In the curriculum, Agriculture is a compulsory subject for all students. Wood working, metal work, and technical drawing are encouraged for boys, and home economics is encouraged for girls. One of the biggest criticisms of secondary schools in Malawi is that they are too university-oriented and needs more technical skills taught. Most students immediately enter the workforce and need a different orientation. Therefore, Secondary schools do not produce as many graduates as the labor market demands. In fact, only one-fourth of Malawi's youth end up attending secondary school. Public school system The government established free primary education for all children in 1994, which increased attendance rates, according to UNICEF.\\"Malawi\\" . 2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.

In 1994, the gross primary enrollment rate was 133.9 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 102.6 percent. In 1995, 62 percent of students entering primary school reached grade two, and 34 percent reached grade five. The dropout rate is higher among girls than boys. Private school system Private schools have risen in Malawi and offer an alternative to public schools. Private schools include school like Phungu, Lilongwe Girls, Hossana private School and Sunnyside School. Some consolidates private schools are run by the Designated Schools Board. =Charitable Foundation schools= Many independent schools have been set up as charitable foundations in Malawi with a specific targeted pupil. Jacaranda School The Jacaranda Foundation, founded by nanny Marie Da Silva, maintains the Jacaranda School. It is Malawi's only entirely free school for primary and secondary students. The vast majority of students of the Jacaranda School are orphaned by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as featured on 2008 CNN Heroes. St Patricks academy & primary The Joyce Banda Foundation The Joyce Banda Foundation is a foundation that runs schools for primary and secondary schools in Malawi. Raising Malawi Academy for Girls The Raising Malawi foundation is in the process of building a school aimed at female education in Malawi. The Legson Kayira Primary School and Community Center The Youth of Malawi foundation has built a solar-powered, rainwater harvesting primary school in the village of Chimphamba, in the Mchinji district of rural Malawi. University system The university sector in Malawi is composed of four public universities and several private universities. The public universities are (in order of founding): = University of Malawi = Malawi's first and largest tertiary educational institution is the University of Malawi. It was founded in 1964 and operates on several campuses. = Mzuzu University = Mzuzu University was founded in 1997 and is one of the principal universities of Malawi. The school is located in Mzuzu city in the northern region of the country. Malawi is a very poor place with kids all around playing and adults farming. Some kids help the adults with farming but most goes to school. = Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources = Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources is a university outside Lilongwe, Malawi. It was formed in 2011 by a merger between Bunda College of Agriculture of the University of Malawi and Natural Resources College (NRC). = The Malawi University of Science and Technology = The Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST), sometimes referred to as the University of Southern Malawi, was established on 17 December 2012 by the Malawi University of Science and Technology Act No. 31 of 2012 as the fourth Public University in Malawi. It was officially opened in 2014 by Professor Peter Mutharika, LL.B(Hons), J.D.S. It's situated in the prestigious shire highlands in Thyolo, Malawi. This institution is occupying a total plot area of and has total building area of . The seating capacity of this university is 3000 but can accommodate about twice that seating capacity. Evidently, this University will hugely contribute to the government of Malawi's efforts to widening access to higher education. Once fully operational, the University will have the Malawi Institute of Technology, Ndata School of Climate & Earth Sciences, Academy of Medical Sciences and the Bingu School of Culture and Heritage. The Malawi Industrial Research and Technology Development Centre will be part of the MIT. Private universities in Malawi include the following: = Central Christian University = Central Christian University (CCU) CCU is Research-Based Private-Not-Profit University dedicated to provide Open and Distance Learning programmes in Malawi = Catholic University of Malawi = The university is located in Montfort campus in Chiladzulu District in Malawi. It was established in 2004 and opened in 2006, with faculties of social science and education. It now additionally offers economics, marketing, business administration, and accounting. University fees recently increased sixfold to about ¬£380 per year, more than double Malawi‚Äôs legal minimum wage. Teaching and education profession The Ministry of Education develops the curricula used in Malawi's schools and oversee teacher training. Teachers take both pedagogical and academic courses. Supervised practical teaching is expected before teaching independently. Most teachers begin as primary school teachers in a demonstration school adjacent to teacher training facilities. Later, block teaching is tried during which the teacher trainee tries teaching a class on their own for six weeks. Three types of lecturers educate potential teachers. Graduate teacher educators chair most departments, aided by diplomate and non-diplomate assistants. =Primary teachers= Malawi has four professional teaching Grades (PT) of primary school teachers. The PT4 teacher holds a Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE) which is four years of secondary school education, and a two-year Teachers Certificate. PT3 is obtained after going through interviews after serving for fours at PT4 Grade. PT2 and PT1 they are also obtained through interviews. However, PT2 is an administrative grade (Deputy Head teacher) while PT1 is reserved for the head teacher, primary education advisors and field supervisors. =Secondary teachers= Secondary school teachers are trained at the School of Education. This school awards three types of professional qualifications, which are: Diploma of Education, Bachelor of Education and the University Certificate of Education. =University lecturers= Malawi citizens who serve as professors constitute 30 percent of the university's faculty. In 1977, a total of 87 of the 199 working faculty or 87 percent were expatriates. While 27 percent of the professoriat were from Malawi and a further 48 percent were pursuing advanced degrees abroad. There is a need both to upgrade or develop personnel currently serving as professors and to train many more Malawians to fill these posts. =Non-governmental organisations= DAPP Malawi operates 4 teacher training colleges to meet the need for more primary school teachers in rural areas. Wungwero Book Foundation trains teacher librarians at the DAPP teacher training college. AYISE, a large non-governmental organization based in Blantyre, Malawi, provides education at its youth center and works with local schools.

This article incorporates text from this source which is in the public domain. There are approximately 1900 schools in Namibia of which 100 are privately owned. Namibian subjects' syllabi are based on the International General Certificate of Secondary Education which is part of Cambridge International. The Constitution directs the government to provide free primary education; however, families must pay fees for uniforms, stationery, books, hostels, and school improvements.  Educational strategies  =Before independence= Before Namibia's independence, the country's education system was designed to reinforce apartheid rather than provide the necessary human resource base to promote equitable social and economic development. It was fragmented along racial and ethnic lines, with vast disparities in both the allocation of resources and the quality of education offered. This article incorporates text from this source which is in the public domain. =After independence= The new Government of the Republic of Namibia (GRN) set about to create one unified structure for education administration. Currently, Namibia allocates more than 20% of its national budget to education. This represents six to seven percent of Namibia's total GDP and is one of the three countries with the highest percentage of GDP directed toward education in the world. Educational institutions in Namibia and their portfolio are accredited by the Namibia Qualifications Authority (NQA). This institution evaluates and accredits national institutions and degrees, as well as foreign qualifications of people who wish to demonstrate the national equivalence of their degrees earned abroad. Researchers from the United States Agency for International Development opine that the investment is paying off. A new, uniform and learner-centered curriculum for grades one through twelve, finalized in 1998, has received recognition beyond Namibia's borders and significant progress has been made in the use of English (which replaced Afrikaans as the nation's official language) as a medium of instruction. About 95 percent of school age children attend school and the number of teachers has increased by almost 30 percent since 1990. Over 3000 new classrooms have been built. As a result of these improvements, repetition rates in all grades have been reduced. Whereas in 1991, half the learners in grade 1 were repeating the grade, by 2003, over 84 percent of learners were earning their promotions on time. Dropout rates have also plummeted. On the other hand, Namibia's former Minister of Education Abraham Iyambo summarily described the Namibian education system as \\"crippled\\", citing dropout rates, lack of teaching facilities, financial difficulties, sub-standard vocational training, and absence of pre-primary development. A National Conference on Education, running from 27 June to 1 July 2011, was conferred to address the most pressing issues. The Namibian education system is experiencing many obstacles. It is faced with serious weaknesses in the provision of education to all. Additionally the quality of education, quality of teachers and the performance of learners is unsatisfactory. The Ministry of Education is drafting an improvement program that is known as the ETSIP (Education and Training Sector Improvement Program). The ETSIP aims to align the entire Namibian education system to Namibia's Vision 2030 and the needs of the Namibian population. In all government schools, primary education is free since 2013, and secondary education since 2016. Tertiary educational institutions, both private and public, charge tuition fees. Corporal punishment is not allowed. Education sectors The curriculum development, educational research, and professional development of school teachers is centrally organised by the National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) in Okahandja. =Pre-primary education= The Namibian government introduced a three-year pre-primary education pilot programme in 2008. This programme was subsequently given a two-year extension and will thus run until 2013. It aims at giving children from poor backgrounds access to pre-primary education and is aimed at children between the ages of five and six. The programme requires the implementation of pre-primary education at primary schools. The progress on the pilot programme thus far: * Khomas Region - 21 of the 67 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education. * «ÅKaras Region - 18 out of 38 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education. * Caprivi Region - 24 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education. * Ohangwena Region - 27 of the 138 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education. =Primary education= Compulsory education starts at primary education level at an age of 6. Primary education consists of seven years from Grade 1 to Grade 7 to prepare children for secondary education. The Namibian Government introduced free primary education in 2013. =Secondary education= Secondary education stretches over a period of 5 years from Grade 8 to Grade 12. Children are presented with a Junior Secondary School Certificate after successful completion of Grade 10. After successful completion of Grade 12 learners are presented with a Namibia Senior Secondary Education Certificate. This certification can either be the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) or the Higher International General Certificate of Secondary Education (HIGCSE). IGCSE exam papers are set and marked in Namibia, but moderated by Cambridge. HIGCSE question papers are set, marked and moderated by the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Grade 12 cannot be repeated on a full-time basis, for learners that wish to pursue further studies they need to obtain a good grade as per the requirements of tertiary institution both locally or abroad. The Evaluation Scale for Grade 12 is: *IGCSE grades: A B C D E F G *Equivalent points: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 *HIGCSE grades: 1 2 3 4 *Equivalent points: 10 9 8 7 =Tertiary education= Universities and colleges Namibia has two public tertiary institutions of general education, the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST) and the University of Namibia (UNAM) and one private University, the International University of Management (IUM). At NUST admission is based on grade 12 certificate with a maximum of five qualifying subjects with a total score of 25 points or more and a E symbol or better in English. At the University of Namibia's basic requirement for entrance to undergraduate degree programmes is a Namibia Senior Secondary Certificate (NSSC) with a pass in five subjects with a total score of 25 points, on the UNAM evaluation scale, or more in not more than three examination sittings. There are a number of specialised tertiary educational institutions such as the College of the Arts (Cota) in Windhoek, The University Centre for Studies in Namibia (TUCSIN) in Windhoek, Oshakati, Rundu, and Rehoboth, the Namibian Maritime and Fisheries Institute (NAMFI) in Walvis Bay, and the Namibian Institute of Mining and Technology (NIMT) in Arandis. Vocational education Namibian plumbing students The Namibian Training Authority (NTA) controls seven vocational centers and supports a number of other institutions like Namwater. They offer a range of courses for school leavers, including; Plumbing, Welding, Electrical general, Automotive electrical, Bricklaying, Cabinet making, Technical drawing, Dressmaking, Hospitality, Office management and Automotive mechanics. Vocational students in Namibia are given a small amount of money from the government to assist them in attending Vocational Training Centers. Statistics In 1997, the gross primary enrollment rate was 130.6 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 91.2 percent. According to the Ministry of Labor's child labor survey, 80 percent of working children between the ages of 6 and 18 continue to attend school while they are employed. In 1998, there were 400,325 Namibian students in primary school and 115,237 students in secondary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio in 1999 was estimated at 32:1, with about 8% of the GDP being spent on education. In 2011 the Namibian education system accommodated approximately 600,000 learners of which 174,000 were senior secondary students and below 10,000 were pre-primary pupils. While teachers are seen as generally adequately educated they lack specialised training. Schools consistently perform below expectation; failure and dropout rates are high. Only 12% of learners proceed into tertiary education of any kind due to limited places in universities and vocational training. In 2019 the number of learners at school had increased to 755,943.

Although education is compulsory between the ages of seven and fifteen, with primary and secondary school leading into optional higher education, Niger has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world. With assistance from external organizations, Niger has been pursuing educational improvement, reforming how schools utilize languages of instruction, and exploring how the system can close gender gaps in retention and learning.

Education for all in Niger. Last accessed on 11/2/2014 Enseignement, Formation, Recherche. Last accessed on 11/2/2014 Last accessed on 11/2/2014. The World Bank cites the UNESCO Institute for Statistics' current estimate of primary school enrollment at 71%, though this figure is inflated because it counts the many overage children who are still in primary school.  Languages of Instruction  French was adopted as Niger's only official language in its first constitution in 1960, and was therefore the only language permitted in schools for a decade after independence. While the number of recognized national languages expanded to include 8 local languages in 1989, and 2 more in 2001, Niger's schools have been slow to implement multilingual education. This created educational barriers for students in Niger who spoke other regional languages and often had a limited grasp of French, leading to difficulty understanding materials taught in schools. Following a 1965 world conference on education in Tehran, where evidence from around the world showed failings in literacy education not conducted in the learner‚Äôs fluent language, Mali demonstrated greatly improved outcomes in literacy using local languages as part of mother-tongue-medium-education (MTME). Programs like this one gained global traction in this period, leading Niger to begin using local languages for school instruction in some schools as early as 1972. In fact, Niger was among the first to incorporate such programs in West Africa. = Bilingual education reform = Even with early efforts being focused at multilingual and bilingual education in Niger, more consistent and widespread implementation of these methods has been decades in the making. In a 2005 study, experimental schools showed an exclusion or drop-out rate about 14 percent lower than traditional schools, and successful completion of primary education without repeats at a rate 17 percent higher than traditional schools. Following a 2008 curriculum reform initiative, Niger's Ministry of Education piloted a program in 500 schools featuring local languages for instruction in early grades and introducing French gradually in later years. This pilot was expanded to 5,000 schools for the 2017-2018 school year. Studies showed student performance was highest in bilingual schools and lowest in traditional (Francophone) schools. While evidence indicates favorable outcomes, bilingual and multilingual education has developed gradually in Niger, despite support for these programs originating in the early 1960s. Many complications remain in further implementing multilingual education in Niger, such as exclusively French-language national exams, French involvement in the language policy of former colonies, political motivations hindering more expansive programs, and financial limitations to successful implementation.  Gender Inequality  Niger is ranked close to the bottom of the Human Development Reports' Gender Inequality Index, placed at 151 out of 189 countries. Access to education makes up part of this index's criteria, with figures showing educational disparities among an already undereducated general population. While only 23 percent of boys complete secondary school, the figure is even lower for girls at just 17 percent. At all levels of schooling, girls attend less than boys. Literacy rates also reflect educational inequality, with 23 percent of girls over the age of fifteen demonstrating literacy, compared to 39 percent of boys of the same age group. This inequality can be attributed to several factors, including safety concerns, long distances and lack of access to schools, cultural norms that prioritize education less for girls, and child marriage. The impact of gender inequality in Niger, which is partially driven by unequal access to education, extends beyond just the educational sphere. The World Bank estimates that by giving women more equal spending and earning power‚Äì‚Äìspecifically through investments in girls' education and reducing child marriage‚Äì‚ÄìNiger's GDP per capita could increase by up to a fourth. Gender inequality in education is therefore more than just an issue of principle for the nation, since it impacts the economic well-being of all. = Efforts to close the gender gap = Both educational authorities in Niger and international organizations have taken steps to address gender inequality in education. For example, the United States Agency for International Development and UNICEF have both pledged to assist Niger's government in making education more accessible for girls. And Niger's government has laid out a ten-year plan for the education sector from 2014-2024 committing to, among other things, incentivizing girls' enrollment and retention. While it remains to be seen exactly how successful implementation of these strategies will be by 2024, the program has been endorsed and supported by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Tertiary education There are five universities in Niger. The first and biggest, the Abdou Moumouni University in Niamey was founded as the University of Niamey in 1974. The Islamic University of Niger in Say was opened in 1986. In 2008, two public universities, the University of Zinder in Zinder and University of Maradi in Maradi were created. In 2010, the University of Tahoua or Universite de Tahoua was created in Tahoua.

Pre-school education is usually for children five years or younger. Primary school education begins for children at age seven, at the end of which students take the external primary school certificate exam. Primary school is followed by junior secondary school which is three years. The final two years of secondary school lead to pre-university training. The final school exam is the Swaziland General Certificate of Education (SGCSE) or the International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE). A few schools offer the AS and A-levels or the International Baccalaureate. Tertiary education in Eswatini includes universities, technical and vocational colleges, teacher and nursing colleges and business colleges, located in various towns and cities around the country, with the biggest concentration being in the Manzini-Mbabane corridor. The University of Eswatini is the national university, and the only institution offering research level and post-graduate facilities in the country. Many students enroll in universities and colleges in neighboring countries such as South Africa. Early childhood to high school In Eswatini, early childhood care and education (ECCE) centers are in the form of preschools or neighborhood care points (NCPs). 21.6% of preschool-age children had access to early childhood education in 2015. Primary education in Eswatini begins at the age of six, and is a seven-year program that culminates with an end of primary school examination [SPC], in grade 7, which is a locally based assessment administered by the Examinations Council through schools. Primary education is from grade 1 to grade 7. The secondary and high school education system in Eswatini is a five-year program divided into three years of junior secondary and two years of senior secondary. There is an external public examination (Junior Certificate) at the end of the junior secondary years which students must pass in order to progress to the senior secondary level. The Examination Council of Swaziland (ECOS) administers this examinations. At the end of the senior secondary level, students take a public examination, the Swaziland General Certificate of Secondary Education (SGCSE) and International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), which is accredited by the Cambridge International Examination (CIE). A few schools offer the Advanced Studies (AS) programme in their curriculum. There are 830 public schools in Eswatini, including primary, secondary, and high schools. There also 34 recognised private schools, with an additional 14 unrecognised. The biggest number of schools is in the Hhohho region. Education in Eswatini, as of 2009, is free at the primary level, mainly grades 1 through 4, and is also free for orphaned and vulnerable children, though not compulsory. In 1996, the net primary school enrollment rate was 90.8%, with gender parity at the primary level. In 1998, 80.5% of children reached grade five. Swaziland is home to a United World College. In 1963, Waterford school, later named Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa, was founded as southern Africa's first multiracial school. In 1981, Waterford Kamhlaba joined the United World Colleges movement as the first and only United World College on the African continent. Adult and non-formal education centres include Sebenta National Institute for adult basic literacy and Emlalatini Development Centre, which provides alternative educational opportunities for school children and young adults who have not been able to complete their schooling. St Joseph's School is known for providing services for disabled students as well as vocational training for adults. In 2019, the Kirsh Foundation began installing \\"free fast Internet\\" to Emaswati primary schools, promoting parity in education with developed nations, with the target goal of 100 schools online that are already furnished with computer equipment by the foundation's computer education trust, with Philip Kirsh overseeing the installations.Magango, Mhlengi \\"Over 100 govt schools to have free, fast internet\\", beginning with Vulamasango High School, in January; Swazi Observer on PressReader.com; 14 Jan 2019.

In 1996, the gross primary enrollment rate was 119.6 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 81.3 percent. Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Togo as of 2001. (While enrollment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect children‚Äôs participation in school.) The education system has had teacher shortages, lower education quality in rural areas, and high repetition and dropout rates. In the north part of the country, 41 percent of the primary school teachers are remunerated by the parents compared with only 17 percent in Lome, where incomes are substantially higher. Despite the increase in number of school kids, education in Togo is insufficient. The number of adults that go to school is very low. The mean of adult learning from 2003 to 2013 was estimated to be only 3% of the adult population.Togo Education Stats, NationMaster. 13 March 2013. Nevertheless, there are attempts to improve the quality of education in Togo. A plan for free education has been put into action; tuition for primary schools has been forbidden.

Sustained structural reform efforts since the early 1990s, prudent macroeconomic policies, and deeper trade integration in the global economy have created an enabling environment for growth. This environment has been conducive to attain positive achievements in the education sector which placed Tunisia ahead of countries with similar income levels, and in a good position to achieve MDGs. According to the HDI 2007, Tunisia is ranked 90 out of 182 countries and is ranked 4th in MENA region just below Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan. Education is the number one priority of the government of Tunisia, with more than 20 percent of government‚Äôs budget allocated for education in 2005/06. As of 2006 the public education expenditure as a percentage of GDP stood at 7 percent. Literacy Literacy Rate of Tunisia population plus 15 1985-2015 by UNESCO Institute of Statistics Education Sector Reforms Tunisian education system was built on the French model, therefore, the focus of the education reformers was to Arabize curriculum and faculty at nation‚Äôs schools and universities. Tunisia adopted a phased approach towards Arabization. Given the number of Francophone nationals and the absence of qualified Arabized teachers to teach scientific subjects, policy makers maintained French both as a foreign language and as a medium of instruction for math and science in primary education. Humanities and social sciences were Arabized incrementally, initially in primary and subsequently in secondary education. In the 1970s, the decision was made to extend Arabization to all subjects in post-primary education, except vocational, professional, and technical tracks. At the university level, French was maintained as the language of instruction in technical institutes and science faculties. There have also been several other reforms since independence to further improve the education system at all levels: 1) Education is an important Law that actually passed in 1958 emphasized technical and vocational education, and the training of a new breed of educators who are qualified to teach the new curriculum emphasizing Arabic language, literature, Islamic thought and history and geography of the Tunisian and North African region. 2) Then a Higher Education Law was passed that placed all government recognized institutions of higher learning and scientific research under the umbrella of University of Tunis, an institute that was established in 1960, by incorporating several existing higher schools and institutes. 3) In the academic year of 1990-91, the New Education Act introduced an increased length of instruction at the primary and secondary levels from 12 to a total of 13 years. It also made it mandatory for students of ages between 6‚Äì16 years of age to attain basic education training. 4) Tunisia introduced competency-based approach in school curriculum in 2000, and revised textbooks accordingly. 5) The 2002 Education Act emphasized the importance of ICT in the education sector. Education System The academic year runs from September to June and examinations are held in late June or early July. =Early Childhood Care and Education(ECE)= The Tunisian government has shown strong commitment towards pre-school education. Pre- school education is to be imparted in establishments or specifically designated places to the children from three to six years of age. In Tunisia the pre-school education is provided primarily in three settings: Kindergartens- These are socio-educational institutions that come under the supervision of Ministry of Women, Family, and Childhood and they belong to either private sector, the quasi-public local authorities or specialist associations. There has been considerable improvement in the coverage of kindergartens from 7.1 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 2000.But this rate is still low primarily because most 3 to 6-year-olds do not attend kindergarten. Kouttabs - These religious institutions also cater for children between 3 and 5 years of age. Their task is to initiate them into learning the Quran as well as reading, writing, and arithmetic. They are under the supervision of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Reforms have enabled to increase the number of these schools from 378 in 1987 to 961 in 2007. These Kottabs host 25,194 children, 11,138 of whom are girls. They are run by mold dibs (teachers) among whom 121 hold degrees in Islamic Sciences, and 60 hold university degrees. A presidential project, ‚ÄúTomorrow Tunisia‚Äù, has been launched to further support Kouttabs so that they fulfill their education mission of consolidating values of religion. Preparatory year's is also an integral part of basic education but it is not compulsory. It is supervised by the Ministry of Education and Training and is provided in public, private and quasi-public primary schools. The gross enrollment rate at pre-primary has increased steadily since 2000 from 15 percent to 22 percent in 2003. =Basic Education= Enseignement de base consists of nine years of school education and is divided into two distinct stages: 6 years of primary and 3 years of preparatory education (lower secondary). At the end of 9 years students sit for examen national de fin d‚Äô√âtudes de l‚Äôenseignement de base, success in which leads to the Dipl√¥me de Fin d‚Äô√âtudes de l‚ÄôEnseignement. Students are required to score above 50 percent at the end of sixth grade to progress to the lower secondary level. Although there is a high percentage of students who fail the important grade 6 examinations. Now due to government efforts, the number of students who have to repeat grade 6 is decreasing. In 1991-92, 26 percent of students had to repeat grade 6. But in 1999-2000 that number has dropped to 18 percent. The drop out rate at the primary level is 6 percent and it halved from the drop out the percentage of 12 percent in 2000. The gross enrollment ratio at primary and secondary is greater than 1 which shows that more girls than boys are enrolled at these two education levels. The share of private enrollment at primary level has been slowly increasing from 0.7 percent in 2000 to 0.9 percent in 2003 and in 2007 the private enrollment share was 1.4 percent. The gross enrollment ratio at lower secondary level in 2007 stood at 113 percent, a jump of about 7 percentage points from the GER in 2006. Also at the beginning of the 2007/208 school year, 9 Pioneer middle schools were launched to offer gifted students early care that will allow them to pursue their studies in pioneer schools in scientific, literary and art fields, with competent and experienced teachers. =Secondary (upper) education= The four years of secondary education are open to all holders of Dipl√¥me de Fin d'etudes de l‚ÄôEnseignement de Base where the students focus on entering university level or join the workforce after completion. The Enseignement secondary is divided into two stages: general academic and specialized. In the academic stream all students follow a common curriculum for one year after which they choose one of the five specializations from language arts, sciences, and economics and management in case the student is specializing in science at the end of the second year he must choose again but this time between math, experimental sciences, computer sciences or technical sciences . The language of instruction in technical, scientific and mathematics fields is French. At the end of the fourth year of secondary studies, students take Examen National du Baccalaur√©at. Students are tested on average on six subjects. Those students who complete the secondary cycle, but fail the baccalaureate are awarded a certificate of completion that can later be used for entry into the workforce or for entry to further studies in a private school. In 1995 42.5 percent of baccalaureate takers were successful. However, Tunisia has been appearing in TIMSS since 1999 and has been one of the top performing countries in the Arab region. In 2007, Tunisia ranked second in mathematics and third in science in all of the Arab countries appearing in TIMSS , inInternationalwith scores 420 and 445 respectively. The gender parity index of gross enrollment ratio at the secondary level was 1.1 percent in 2006, implying higher female enrollment than male enrollment at the secondary level. =Technical and Vocational Track= Professional and vocational programs are administered by the Ministry of Employment, and in more specific disciplines by individual ministries such as agriculture and tourism. Students can opt to enroll in a two-year vocational program leading to the award of dice the Certificat d‚ÄôAptitude Professionnelle. These students who have completed the first two years of secondary education may enroll in two-year vocational programs leading to the award of the Brevet de Technicien Professionnel, which in turn gives access to two-year Brevet de Technicien Sup√©rieur programs. The enrollment in TVET at the secondary level has also been rising since 2004.The current(2007) enrollment ratio in TVET is almost 10 percent, with a higher percentage of males enrolled in these programs. =Higher education= The higher education system in Tunisia has experienced a rapid expansion and the number of students has more than tripled over the past 10 years from approximately 102,000 in 1995 to 365,000 in 2005. The gross enrollment rate at the tertiary level in 2007 was 31 percent, with gender parity index of GER of 1.5. The private university system in Tunisia, accounting for about one percent of students, remains small because the regulatory environment does not encourage foreign investment or the use of part-time teachers in private universities. In Tunisia in 2005‚Äì2006, there were 178 public institutions of higher education among which there were 13 universities, 24 higher institutes of technological studies and six higher institutes of teachers' training. The Higher Education Ministry (HEM) supervises 155 institutions and 23 are under the co-supervision of the HEM and other ministries. In addition HEM recognizes 20 university-level private institutions. The public university system is virtually free and student loans are not available for students enrolled in a private university, making it difficult for private universities to attract students who cannot afford to pay the fees. During the last decade, in addition to creating seven new universities, the Government of Tunisia (GOT) has made progress in i) in improving the internal efficiency of programs and pass rates in applied science programs and selected short-term programs such as at the higher institutes of technology (Instituts sup√©rieurs des √©tudes technologiques) (ii) introducing shorter term professional programs with more relevance; and (iii) granting greater autonomy to universities to give them the flexibility to respond to the changing environment and adapt academic programs to the needs of the economy. Access to post secondary education is guaranteed to all students holding a baccalaureate diploma. The admission process is centrally controlled through the national university orientation system. Although this centralized system has been criticized for its rigidity as it leaves students unsatisfied by the disciplines they have been placed in. The pass rate of the Baccalaureate is not very high in Tunisia. On average 60 percent of students fail the baccalaureate each year. Recently since 2005‚Äì06, the government has been trying to implement reform that is based on the European three-tier model of bachelor‚Äôs, master's and doctoral degrees. This reform is known as LCD :licence (three years) master‚Äôs (two-years), doctorate (five years). The new academic credit hour system is meant to give students greater flexibility in designing their study tracks, while allowing them to earn and transfer credits between institutions both domestically and internationally. At the university level the first cycle of studies in the academic stream is of two years, which leads to the award of Diploma d‚ÄôEtudes Universitaires du Premier Cycle. This first degree is regarded as a preparatory one. Then in most other fields, the second cycle leads to the award of Maitrise, which is considered the first degree in Tunisian university system. Later the Diplome d‚ÄôEtudes Approfondies (DEA) is awarded to Maitrise holders after a further two-year study and the preparation and defense of a thesis. DEA is also a prerequisite for entry into a doctoral program. Despite this progress, however, numerous challenges remain, as student enrollments in public universities are projected to increase by about 6.6 percent annually, reaching approximately 470,000 (all categories) in 2010, while at the same time, the quality and relevance of education are in need of updating. At 2 percent of GDP, public spending on higher education is already higher than in most countries in the world. Unemployment among university graduates is increasing and the employability of graduates in modern, export-oriented sectors is weak. Mechanisms and incentives to promote quality at the university level are for the most part inadequate and universities cannot fully exercise the autonomy that will help them to better respond to the changes in the labor markets and requirements of a global economy. In sum, due to the projected increase in enrollment, the GOT is faced with a challenge of meeting public demand for higher education in an equitable way, and improving quality in a cost-efficient manner, while responding to existing and new labor market needs. ICT Integration in Education Tunisia is supported by international organizations (e.g., the World Bank, Microsoft, and Apple in incorporating ICT at all levels of education. These organizations provide support to the government in implementing ICT staff training programs, supporting professional development, providing networking opportunities; researching, developing and evaluating new policy approaches in setting up ICT infrastructure in the country. Some of the innovative projects were the Mobile laboratories and Mobile Internet Buses connected to the internet via satellites to target schools in rural and remote areas so as to reduce the digital divide. Then launched in 1999Global. Teenager Project was launched that led to global classroom debates in cyber space. Tunisia also hosted the second phase of the world summit on information systems. In 2004, there were 22,000 computer (0.28 computers for every class), but by 2006 there were 57,000 computers (0.71 computers for every class). Although the presidential election program is working towards achieving 1 computer per class by 2009. It is foreseen that the number of trained teachers will increase to 80,000 in 2009 from 60,000 in 2006. All higher education institutes are connected to the internet by El Khawarizmi Calculus Center, which is the official public internet service provider to higher education institutes. The integration of ICT in education is further reinforced by Tunisian Virtual School and the Virtual University of Tunis. =TVS= Tunisia was one of the first countries in North Africa and Arab countries to pioneer in the field of distance education and e-learning through the launch of TVS in January 2002. It provides fee interactive courses, revision modules, assistance and ICT training. =Virtual University of Tunis= It was established as a government initiative in 2003, and it now provides 20 percent of the courses through e-learning. It does not cover all specialties but it does award diplomas and certificates. There are 207 modules, representing more than 8,000 hours, that are ready for use. The university currently has 10 functional access centers, and by 2009 there will be 200. Adult Education The Tunisian government introduced the National Program for Adult Literacy (PNEA) in April 2000. It is supervised by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity. To support this program various civil society organizations and NGO‚Äôs have contributed immensely to ensure that adults could gain skills useful in the current job market. For example, in 2006-2007, 5000 young people aged below 30, 40 of whom women, took part in introductory vocational training courses.

In 1998, the gross primary enrollment ratio was 110.5 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 99.4 percent. As of 2001, attendance was decreasing due to security concerns and the burden of school fees, often due to the cost of transport. Following the government coup in May 2000, more than 5,000 students were reported to have left school. Fijian Education is a combination of multiculturalism and multiracialism and allows for the guidance and administration of numerous religious organizations. The Ministry of Education in Fiji is taking major steps to subsidize the educational fees and other costs related to it and hence bringing it under the affordability of everyone. The ministry is concerned about all the aspects of education and it is putting all the efforts to judiciously allocate the educational resources to everybody and especially to the rural areas. Various education policies are formulated and it highlights the primary areas like in-service training, personnel management along with the budgetary features. The Fiji Education System is taken care of by the government but most of the schools are managed either by the local committees or by a single racial community. One can get admitted to the secondary schools by appearing in the competitive exams and the student has to pay a nominal fee, the balance being subsidized by the government. At tertiary level, there are three universities in Fiji: Fiji National University, University of the South Pacific and University of Fiji. Fiji National University is the main public university and comprises the colleges of medicine, business, agriculture, humanities and engineering. It is also home to Fiji's National Productivity Organization and the Fiji Maritime Academy. The University of the South Pacific is a regional Pacific university, with campuses on a number of Pacific islands. Its main campus is in Suva. The University of Fiji was set up by a church and is based in the West. Government has put in policies to try to improve ease of access to Tertiary education by implementing a student loans scheme called the Tertiary Education Loans Scheme (TELS), intended to provide financing to Fijian students who have qualified for higher education in approved institutions of higher learning but are unable to support themselves financially, increasing equitable access to higher education in the country in line with the Fijian Government‚Äôs vision of ‚ÄúBuilding a Smarter Fiji‚Äù. A free bus fare scheme for Primary and Secondary students for those who come from families with a combined income of less than $15,000 was also rolled out by the government to ease access of being able to go to school, and was extended to those traveling by minibus, boats, and carriers. School fees were also been removed to provide free school education and improve education access for all Fiji children.

Stands are emplaced inside of the \\"board\\" of the drilling rig. They are usually kept between \\"fingers\\". Most boards will allow stands to go ten stands deep and as much as fifty stands wide on land based rigs. The stands are further held in place using ropes in the board which are tied in a shoe knot by the derrickman. Stands are emplaced on the floor of the drilling rig by the chain hand. When stands are being put onto the floor the chainhand is said to be \\"racking stands\\". After the bottom of the stand is placed on the floor, the derrickman will unlatch the elevators and pull the stand in either with a rope or with just his arms. When stands are being put back into the hole, the derickman will slam the stand into the elevators to force them to latch. The chainhand will brace against the stand to control it when the driller picks it up.

In 1998, the gross primary enrollment rate was 84.4 percent, and net primary enrollment rate was 70.7 percent. School quality and access to education are better in urban areas; schools in small communities on isolated islands are expensive to maintain. Mission schools are slowly being absorbed into the government primary school system. There are primary schools on most of the inhabited islands. Secondary schools are located on some of the islands with students travelling to live at their school. For example, Abaiang, which is in the northern Gilbert Islands, has three secondary schools, in 2011 there were 212 students at the Ministry of Education school, Ueen Abaiang, which is located between the villages of Koinawa and Aonobuaka. A further 135 students are enrolled at St Joseph's College in Tabwiroa and 23 students at Steven Whitmee High School in Morikao, making 370 secondary school students in total. The two high schools at Morikao and Tabuiroa accommodate students from all over Kiribati who have passed the entrance examinations to get into the schools. St. Joseph's College was founded in 1939. Its alumni include both current President Anote Tong, and previous incumbent Teburoro Tito. There are primary schools and secondary schools operated by the Christian denominations including the Roman Catholic Church (such as St. Joseph's College) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, (such as Moroni High School in South Tarawa, of which Waitea Abiuta has been the headmaster). The Kiribati Teacher College and King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School, the Government High School, are in Bikenibeu in South Tarawa. Higher education is expanding; students may seek technical, teacher or marine training, or study in other countries. To date, most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji to attend University of the South Pacific, and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba.Pacific Magazine: I-Kiribati Students Perform Well In Cuba, Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association, 24 December 2007.

This is done by physically breaking out or disconnecting (when pulling out of the hole) every other 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe at a time (called a stand) and racking them vertically in the derrick. When feasible the driller will start each successive trip on a different \\"break\\" so that after several trips fresh pipe dope will have been applied (when running back in the hole) to every segment of the drill string. Pulling Pipe on the Derrick Floor preparing to trip into the hole Collection of 90 foot stands after tripping out of the hole for a bit trip The most typical reason for tripping pipe is to replace a worn- out drill bit. Though there are many problems that occur to warrant the tripping of pipe. Downhole tools such as MWD (measurement while drilling), LWD (logging while drilling) or mud motors break down quite often. Another common reason for tripping is to replace damaged drill pipe. It is important to get the pipe out of the wellbore quickly and safely before it can snap. Bit trip Vertical Drill Bit Drill bits wear and tear like most any other piece of equipment. Once a bit becomes too worn to drill at an adequate rate or make a full-gauge hole, or if the bearings are thought to be near failure, a trip is undertaken to replace the bit. A trip is not considered a bit trip when the purpose of replacing the bit is to change sizes. This is only done when the crew \\"sets surface, intermediate or longstring\\" as appropriate. Fishing trip A fishing trip is when a crew is forced to trip pipe to retrieve loose items in the wellbore. This can result from something being dropped in the hole, i.e. a tool, that would cause damage to the bit if the crew attempted to drill with it on bottom. =Twisting off= Another major cause is known as a \\"twist off\\". Twisting off is when the drill string parts by failing catastrophically under the torsional stress. This may happen if the drill string below is pinched in the wellbore, or as the result of a structural weakening of the pipe caused by a washout or a crack in a threaded connection member. =Broken string or broken bit= When pipe snaps or a part of the bit breaks off, the crew has to recover all of the separated items from the wellbore. Recovering snapped pipe usually involves placing a specialized tool (an \\"overshot\\") with grips set inside of it over the broken pipe in an attempt to capture it. The grip works in a manner similar to Chinese fingercuffs. Sometimes the jagged top of the fish must be milled back to a round outside shape before the overshot can slip over it. The overshot contains a packoff device to make a pressure seal so circulation can be reestablished through the bit to facilitate recovery of the fish. For a broken bit, a magnet is commonly used to remove all of the broken parts. =Cracked pipe or collar= A cracked pipe can lead to a broken string. Extra care is taken when tripping for one so that too much pull does not cause the cracked pipe to snap. Cracked pipes (i.e., washouts) are usually noticed by a sudden drop in pressure. The crew will usually pump \\"fastline\\" (small lengths of manila rope taken from unraveled catline) down the drill string to make a temporary plug and time the pressure to see when it rises back to normal. This enables the crew to know how far down to expect the cracked pipe to be within a few stands; also strands of these rope segments may be seen at the point of washout. Most trips for a cracked pipe are not complete trips like a fishing trip or a bit trip. These can be as simple as only going a few stands down, to pulling the drill collars. Logging Logging of the open hole may take place at various depths while drilling, and almost always at the end of the drilling operation. The drill string will be removed from the wellbore to allow a logging crew to conduct a survey of the well. After the logging is completed at total depth, the crew will run the drill string back into the well and then proceed to lay it down when coming out of the hole prior to installing the final set of casing (the \\"production casing\\"). Setting surface, intermediate and longstring These trips are routinely expected by the crew. Setting surface occurs after the wellbore is drilled to the predetermined surface depth (e.g., after drilling below fresh water strata). The crew will remove the entire drill string to allow surface casing to be emplaced. The procedure is similar for setting intermediate, only that it typically involves a much longer drill string to be removed. Setting longstring is usually a one time operation combining both surface and intermediate casing. This saves the time of only having to undertake one pipe trip as opposed to two pipe trips.

Biography  = Early life = Fonseca was born in New York to a family of artists. His father, Gonzalo Fonseca, was an Uruguayan sculptor. His younger brother Caio Fonseca is a well known contemporary painter. His sister Isabel Fonseca is a writer. Fonseca had dyslexia and a stutter, conditions so severe as a child he was treated by a psychiatrist. Fonseca was able to compensate for his verbal difficulties with a tremendous visual fluency, reproducing paintings by Michelangelo and other Great Masters at an early age. Raised in a house on West Eleventh Street in Greenwich Village, Fonseca studied at the Dalton School in Manhattan and St. Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights. Fonseca failed to graduate from high schoolBruno Fonseca: The Secret Life of Painting, p. 21 and at age 18, he moved to Barcelona, where he studied with Augusto Torres. Fonseca lived in Barcelona until 1993, when he returned to New York a few months before his death. Fonseca had what his sister called \\"a slightly perverse anti-taste for exquisite goods and 'luxuries' of all kinds.\\" He preferred old objects, old clothes and junk that he collected from the streets of Barcelona. He chose to live in Barcelona's red-light district, among the city's poor, cripples, addicts, street girls, and bohemians. = Career = Late in his life, Fonseca painted four large paintings known as \\"The War Murals\\" depicting scenes of warfare. The individual works are titled Tank (oil on canvas, 208.2 x 269.2 cm) Fire (oil on canvas, 207 x 284.5 cm), Bucharest (oil on canvas, 208.2 x 279.4 cm), and Timi»ôoaraTimi»ôoara is the city where the anti-Ceau≈üescu revolution began in 1989.

A public showing of \\"The War Murals\\" was the opening exhibition for the John McEnroe Gallery in SoHo in January 1994. Fonseca also had a solo show at New York's Salander-O'Reilly in 1993. After contracting AIDS, Fonseca returned to New York. He married his pupil, German painter Anke Blaue, shortly before his death. He died of AIDS in 1994 at age 36.

The focus is usually on developing approximate formulas for counting these objects in various contexts. The prime number theorem is a key result in this subject. The Mathematics Subject Classification for multiplicative number theory is 11Nxx. Scope Multiplicative number theory deals primarily in asymptotic estimates for arithmetic functions. Historically the subject has been dominated by the prime number theorem, first by attempts to prove it and then by improvements in the error term. The Dirichlet divisor problem that estimates the average order of the divisor function d(n) and Gauss's circle problem that estimates the average order of the number of representations of a number as a sum of two squares are also classical problems, and again the focus is on improving the error estimates. The distribution of primes numbers among residue classes modulo an integer is an area of active research. Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions shows that there are an infinity of primes in each co-prime residue class, and the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions shows that the primes are asymptotically equidistributed among the residue classes. The Bombieri‚ÄìVinogradov theorem gives a more precise measure of how evenly they are distributed. There is also much interest in the size of the smallest prime in an arithmetic progression; Linnik's theorem gives an estimate. The twin prime conjecture, namely that there are an infinity of primes p such that p+2 is also prime, is the subject of active research. Chen's theorem shows that there are an infinity of primes p such that p+2 is either prime or the product of two primes. Methods The methods belong primarily to analytic number theory, but elementary methods, especially sieve methods, are also very important. The large sieve and exponential sums are usually considered part of multiplicative number theory. The distribution of prime numbers is closely tied to the behavior of the Riemann zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis, and these subjects are studied both from a number theory viewpoint and a complex analysis viewpoint. Standard texts A large part of analytic number theory deals with multiplicative problems, and so most of its texts contain sections on multiplicative number theory. These are some well-known texts that deal specifically with multiplicative problems: * * See also * Additive number theory Category:Analytic number theory ","title":"Multiplicative number theory"},{"id":"18103576","text":"De abbatibus (fully Carmen de abbatibus, meaning \\"Song of the Abbots\\") is a Latin poem in eight hundred and nineteen hexameters by the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon monk √Üthelwulf (√Üdiluulf), a name meaning \\"noble wolf\\", which the author sometimes Latinises as Lupus Clarus. It recounts the history of his monastery (possibly at Bywell, or, less probably, Crayke, twelve miles north of York) from its foundation through its six first abbots and ending with √Üthelwulf's two visions. It is addressed to the Bishop of Lindisfarne, Ecgberht, and dates to between 803 and 821. The poem exists in three manuscripts: *L: British Museum, Cotton Tiberius D iv, vol. 2, ff. 158v-166r; originally in Winchester Cathedral I, f. 108v. This manuscript also contains a copy of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, assigned by Plummer to the Winchester group. *O: Bodleian Library, Bodley 163, ff. 209v-226v. *C: Cambridge University Library, Ff. 1.27, pp. 203‚Äì15. The poem was first edited by Wilhelm Wattenbach and Ernst D√ºmmler for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica (1881), but it was based on a bad text from Jean Mabillon. Thomas Arnold produced a superior edition in 1882, but from only two of the manuscripts. Ludwig Traube produced a respected edition of his own, but based on the poor version of D√ºmmler. The definitive critical edition, based on all three manuscripts, a reinterpreted manuscript history, and critical analysis of Traube's version, was produced in 1967 by Alistair Campbell and included an English translation. De abbatibus is, like all Anglo-Latin poetry, constructed out of borrowings and imitations, yet it is not completely unoriginal, and though history has at times been subordinated to a literary trope, it is not without eloquence. Prominent among the works on which √Üthelwulf relied are those of Virgil, though D√ºmmler also found references to Ovid and Cyprianus Gallus. The chief Anglo-Latin poets from which √Üthelwulf gleaned are Aldhelm, Bede, and Alcuin, whose Versus de Sanctis Euboricensis Ecclesiae may have inspired him to write the De abbatibus. The eighth-century Miracula Nyniae episcopi was also an influence. Literature *Campbell, Alistair, ed. and tr. (1967). √Üthelwulf: De Abbatibus.

A career journalist for over twenty years, Taneski was arrested in June 2008 in his hometown of Kiƒçevo for the murders of two women on whose deaths he had also written freelance articles; when arrested he was also being investigated over the death of an additional woman. These articles had aroused the suspicion of the police, since they contained information which had not been released to the public. After DNA tests connected Taneski to the murders, he was arrested and imprisoned on 22 June 2008 and was found dead in his cell the following day, after an apparent suicide. Personal life Vlado Taneski was born in 1952 in Kiƒçevo, SFR Yugoslavia, the second of three children. His parents were both conservative disciplinarians and he had a particularly tense relationship with his mother. His father was a World War II veteran. After studying journalism in Croatia, Taneski began an interest in poetry and writing. At age 21 he met his future wife, a law student named Vesna, with whom he had two children. Taneski worked at a radio station, while Vesna went on to become the city's first female lawyer. Taneski's journalistic career spanned over 20 years, and by the 1980s he worked as a reporter for Skopje- based newspapers Nova Makedonija and Utrinski Vesnik. In 2002, his father committed suicide, and, a few months later, his mother accidentally overdosed on medicine. In 2003, exacerbating the financial problems he was facing, Taneski was laid off from the newspaper, and in 2004, his wife received a promotion and moved to Skopje. Murders Taneski's victims were: * Mitra Simjanoska (64) - disappeared November 16, 2004 after a trip to the market; found January 12, 2005. She had been strangled, bound, tortured, and raped, and had been dead for less than two weeks. * Ljubica Licoska (56) - disappeared in early November 2007 after going to buy groceries; found on February 3, 2008. She had been strangled, bound, beaten, and raped, and had been dead for only a few days. * Zivana Temelkoska (65) - disappeared on May 7, 2008 after a hoax about her son being hospitalised; found on May 16. She had been tortured, raped, strangled, and was bound with telephone cords. All these women were poor, uneducated cleaners, which was also how Taneski's mother had earned a living. The victims had known Taneski's mother personally, which may have been the reason for their selection as victims. Investigation and suicide Taneski came under suspicion for murder after having written articles about the three murders, and was questioned on several occasions. According to police, Taneski's articles contained information which had not been released to the public. For example, differing from all other reports published in the Macedonian press on the murders, Taneski knew that the killer used a telephone cord to bind Temelkoska and that the same cord was left at the scene by the murderer. Taneski was arrested on June 20, 2008 after his DNA was matched to semen found on the victims. Examination of the Taneski family's rural cottage uncovered a cache of pornographic material, ropes and cords matching those used to tie the victims, and items belonging to the victims. Taneski was charged with the murder of two of the women, and the police were preparing to charge him with the murder of the third. Details of the case were printed on June 21, and police were also planning to question Taneski on the May 30, 2003, disappearance of the 73-year-old retired cleaner, Gorica Pavleska. After being transferred to Tetovo, Taneski was found dead in his shared prison cell on June 23. He had apparently drowned in a plastic bucket of water. An inquest concluded that, in the absence of other evidence, his death was suicide.

Making her maiden voyage from Middlesbrough to Quebec and Montreal in September 1897, she began regular service from Avonmouth to Montreal the following month.

She began her service between Liverpool and Montreal, Quebec on 20 April 1903.

One theory had the couple sailing from Dover on , but when inspected in New York on arrival, Crippen and Le Neve were not to be found. The fleeing couple had instead sailed on the Montrose from Antwerp on 20 July.

Kendall, who had been in command of the Montrose in 1910 but had ceased working as a ship's master following his involvement in the Empress of Ireland sinking, was working in the port as the CPR's marine superintendent. He arranged for coal to be transferred from the Montreal, filled both vessels with Belgian refugees and used the Montrose to tow the Montreal to England.Croall, James. Disaster at Sea.

He was the son of Prussian Lieutenant General Henning von Heydebreck (1828‚Äì1904) and his wife Anna von Colmar (1837‚Äì1879). Heydebreck was a member of the Grenadier-Regiment Prinz Karl, and in 1893 was sent to serve in colonial German Southwest Africa. He was in charge of an artillery division during the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, and in 1911 became commanding officer of the Schutztruppe.

The vernacular architecture of the Carpathians draws on environmental and cultural sources to create unique designs. Map of building types used in European farmhouses Vernacular architecture refers to non-professional, folk architecture, including that of the peasants. In the Carpathian Mountains and the surrounding foothills, wood and clay are the primary traditional building materials. Effect of culture and religion =Eastern Christianity= Kryvka Church (now on display at the Lviv Museum of Folk Architecture and Culture in Lviv, Ukraine) was originally from the Turka district, in the ethnographic territory of the Boyko people. Its tripartite, domed design and all-wooden construction are representative of the regional style. Because most Ukrainian, Rusyn, and Romanian people are Eastern Christians, their building techniques have traditionally incorporated religious considerations into their buildings that are distinct from their Western Christian and Jewish neighbours. Firstly, all churches are divided into three parts (the narthex, the nave, and the sanctuary) and include an iconostasis (a wall of icons). The outer shape is often cruciform (cross shaped), but will always include a central dome and often several other domes. Parishioners face east during worship and there are no pews. The main door and windows of the home face south (as in passive solar design), and icons and other religious paraphernalia are displayed in a special icon corner, usually on the east wall. =Judaism= East-Central European synagogues are noted for their unique all-wooden design. Materials and techniques A log cottage from an open-air museum in the Kysuce region of Slovakia. This foothills region is bordered by two Carpathian sub-ranges, the Maple Mountains to the west and the Moravian-Silesian Beskids to the north. Cold snowy winters and a relative abundance of timber combine to inform the use of log wall construction and wooden shakes. Details vary from locale to locale but the majority of homes in this area have traditionally been a single-storey rectangular plan; one or two rooms; a central chimney; a gable, hipped-gable or hipped roof; and plastered and limewashed exteriors. Materials used were those that could be procured locally, including wood (usually oak), mud, straw, fieldstone, lime, and animal dung. Roofs in densely wooded and hilly areas are typically clad in wooden shakes or shingles, while flatter and more open areas have traditionally used rye straw. In the late 19th century two types of construction predominated, horizontal log construction, and frame and fill construction. Log walls were common in areas where wood was available. In places with very poor timber or with an extreme timber shortage post and sill or wattle and daub techniques could also be used. For horizontal log construction, logs needed to be notched in order to hold together. The simple saddle notch is the easiest and therefore common. Dovetailing is used by people with more experience in woodworking. A house with a thatched roof and limewashed plaster walls from the Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum in Bucharest, Romania. The use of plaster and straw suggests it is not from the highlands of the Carpathians proper, but a nearby valley or plain.Many peoples in this area plaster their log homes inside and out to keep out moisture, improve insulation, to hide imperfections in construction, and for general aesthetic value. Traditional plaster is made of clay, water, dung, and straw or chaff. Several coats may be applied to create a smooth finish, and then coated with lime and water to produce a pleasing white colour and protect the clay from the rain. Thatched roofs are traditional, but have been declining in popularity for over a century because they may pose a fire hazard. Dirt floors are common, and are made hard by washing with a dung mixture, although wooden floors are preferred. Typically the long wall of a house is between and and the side wall between and .

It is also a resource guide for those working in public health and aged care. The book rates over 15 approaches to euthanasia according to reliability and peacefulness scales. Strategies covered by the books include: the use of gases (such as nitrogen), poisons such as carbon monoxide, non-prescription drugs such as chloroquine, prescription drugs such as insulin and the opiates and former prescription drugs such as the barbiturates. The book details lawful means of obtaining and administering the drugs and other peripheral issues such as drug storage, shelf life and disposal. The Swiss assisted suicide services are also covered in detail, as are issues such as the writing of wills, advance directives and issues of determining testamentary and decision making capacity.

Composed of slaves who had escaped from Patriot masters, it was led by British officers and sergeants. The regiment was disbanded in 1776, though many of its soldiers probably went on to serve in other Black Loyalist units. Unit formed In 1775, Lord Dunmore, Royal Governor of Virginia, issued a proclamation offering freedom to all slaves of revolutionaries who were willing to join him under arms against the rebels in the American Revolutionary War. Five hundred Virginia slaves promptly abandoned their Revolutionary masters and joined Dunmore's ranks. The governor formed them into the Ethiopian Regiment, also known as Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment. During the war, tens of thousands of slaves escaped, having a substantial economic effect on the American South. An estimated 25,000 slaves escaped in South Carolina; 30,000 in Virginia, and almost one-quarter of the slave population in Georgia. Slaves also escaped in New England and New York, often joining the British forces occupying New York for freedom. While thousands went to the British lines for freedom (and the British evacuated nearly 4,000 Black Loyalists to Nova Scotia and other colonies after the war), others took advantage of the wartime confusion to migrate to other areas of the colonies.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery 1619-1877, Hill and Wang, 1993 \\"Smallpox also ruined the British plan to raise an army of slave and indentured servants by promising them freedom after the war- the disease killed off most of the Ethiopian Regiment even as it assembled.\\"Mann, Charles C. 1491: New Revelations of the Americas before Columbus.\\" Vintage Press. 2005. Page 199. Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, composed of escaped slaves, was probably the first black regiment in the service of the Crown during the revolution. By December 1775 the regiment had nearly 300 black people, including its most famous member, an escaped slave called Titus, then known as Tye. In later years, he became known as Colonel Tye as an honorary title for his military skills. Private Tye and his comrades believed that they were fighting not just for their own individual freedom but for the freedom of enslaved black people in North America. Campaigns The Ethiopian Regiment saw service from 1775 to 1776. The Ethiopians perhaps saw action for the first time at the Battle of Kemp's Landing in November 1775. The Earl of Dunmore defeated the rebellious colonial militia. Two of its colonels were captured. One colonel was taken by one of his former slaves. The black regiment in British service was a symbol of hope for Americans of African descent. That black people were trained to bear arms and kill was a revolutionary idea at the time, especially as they were with one of the world's best armies. In 1775 the Queen's Own Loyal Virginia Regiment, the Ethiopian Regiment, and the 14th Regiment of Foot occupied Norfolk, Virginia, and Dunmore established his headquarters there. Virginia's Committee of Safety ordered Colonel William Woodford in command of 500 Virginia rebels to Norfolk to oppose Dunmore. His men and others gathered at one end of a key bridge (at Great Bridge), on a causeway that connected the mainland to the port of Norfolk. Dunmore's forces, including some of the Ethiopians, had constructed Fort Murray at the other end of the bridge, and Colonel Woodford entrenched on his side of Great Bridge. Woodford sent a black man to Dunmore as a double agent with false news of Woodford's strength (he was to report they had only 300 men.) The spy further said the force were \\"green\\" recruits who would be easily frightened off. Captain Samuel Leslie ordered Captain Charles Fordyce to lead 120 men of the 14th Foot down the causeway to attack the rebel position. The Ethiopian Regiment stood ready on Great Bridge supported by British cannon. Rebel sentries, notably the William Flora, slowed the British advance with \\"buck and ball\\". Alerted by the noise of battle, the rebels manned the breastwork. The Revolutionaries did not fire, and waited until the British were close. Emboldened by the lack of an all-out assault, the British rushed forward. \\"The day is ours!\\" declared Captain Fordyce. Silence was followed by gunfire. The Americans cut down Fordyce and 12 privates. Of the wounded, two were former slaves who belonged to the Ethiopian Regiment: James Sanderson was wounded in the forearm; and Cesar was wounded in the thigh. Woodford marched some of his men through the swamps and attacked the Ethiopian Regiment's flank, forcing them back in confusion. The revolutionaries seized two British cannon, and the British retreated back into their fort. In the following days, the British evacuated the fort and then Norfolk, which was then occupied by revolutionary forces including Woodford and his men. Colonel Tye Titus was a slave who had run away from his master in Monmouth County, New Jersey before Lord Dunmore's proclamation of emancipation to slaves of rebels who would join his ranks. He heard of Lord Dunmore's proclamation, and went to Virginia to enlist in Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment. Uniforms Ethiopian Regiment regimental uniforms had sashes inscribed with the words, \\"Liberty to Slaves\\". Although the men were often used for foraging and other labor, they also saw battle. Unit disbanded Dunmore's defeat was the first significant engagement of the American Revolutionary War in the South. Dunmore disbanded the Ethiopian Regiment in 1776 on Staten Island, although many of its members likely served as Black Pioneers during the occupation of New York. Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment was formed under white officers and noncommissioneds, although it is probable that some of the black recruits later became sergeants. Nothing is known of Tye's activities until he returned to New Jersey. He took part in the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778, and for the next two year was the Black Loyalist guerrilla leader called \\"Colonel\\" Tye. He led the Black Brigade, which served with the Loyalist Queen's Rangers in defending British-held New York in the winter of 1779. Tye led numerous raids in Monmouth County, New Jersey, disrupting American supply lines, capturing rebel officers, and killing suspected Patriot leaders. He died in 1780 of tetanus from a bullet wound in his last raid.

Outside of the pool, Monk gained attention in 2011 after he falsely claimed to have been involved in a deliberate hit-and-run accident. Early life Born in 1988 in Blacktown, New South Wales, Monk attended Quakers Hill High School. He started swimming at the age of four while in Blacktown, and at 14 he started training with coach Tony Shaw, who also trained Grant Brits. Swimming career Monk competed in his first Commonwealth Games in 2006, after being asked to fill in for Ian Thorpe. He finished seventh in the 100m freestyle event, and ninth in the 200m. As a member of the Australian men's relay team, he won gold in the 4√ó100-metre medley (as a heat swimmer) and bronze in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle. Later that year he competed in the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, finishing sixth in the 200-metre freestyle, and taking the bronze medal in the men's 4√ó100-metre and 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay events. Monk came fourth in the 200-metre freestyle at his first World Aquatics Championship in 2007, an achievement that he regarded as one of his best. He was part of the Australian team that won a silver medal in the corresponding relay event. In 2008, Monk won two gold medals at the FINA Short Course World Championships in the 200m freestyle individual competition and the men's 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay. This led to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, although there he was less successful, finishing 22nd in the 200-metre freestyle event. After the disappointment of the Beijing Olympics, Monk announced that he was moving to Brisbane to train with Olympic gold medallist and world record holder Stephanie Rice under coach Michael Bohl. Subsequently he finished third in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay at the 2009 World Aquatics Championship and fifth in the individual 200-metre freestyle. His second Commonwealth Games was the following year, in 2010, where Monk won silver in the individual 200 m freestyle and gold in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay. In 2012, in the 200-metre freestyle, Monk finished 2nd behind Thomas Fraser-Holmes at the Australian trials in Adelaide and qualified for the London Olympics. In London, he could not enter the final of the 200-metre freestyle, finishing 7th in his semi-final, and finished 5th in the final with the Australian 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay team. Accident and police investigation In September 2011, Monk was involved in an accident that put his 2011/2012 season in doubt, in which he fractured his elbow in two places during the leadup to the 2012 Olympic Games. Monk claimed to have been deliberately hit by a car while riding his bike, and a police investigation was launched. However, after a witness emerged who contradicted Monk's statement, it was revealed that he had not been involved in a hit-and-run, but had instead fallen off his skateboard and lied about the cause of the accident. Monk stated that his fabrication was to hide the true cause, as he was \\"not supposed to be engaging in dangerous or high impact sports\\". As a result of making a false statement to police, Monk faced a possible $10,000 fine, three-year jail term and disciplinary action from Swimming Australia. In late November, 2011, the Queensland Police Service announced that they would not be pursuing charges, but he was fined by Swimming Australia and received a letter of reprimand from the Queensland police. In response, the president of the Queensland Police Union spoke out against the decision, arguing against Swimming Australia's defence of Monk, and stated that \\"The public rightly expect that no one should deliberately waste the time of police, whether they be wannabe B-grade celebrity athletes like this modern-day 'boy who cried wolf', Kenrick Monk, or just regular people.\\" Facebook picture In June 2012, Kenrick Monk and Nick D'Arcy published a picture on Facebook where they were holding automatic pistols and pump-action shotguns, drawing extended criticism. After review by Swimming Australia, they were allowed to participate in the London Olympics but were asked to leave the Olympic village as soon as their swimming competition was over.Nick D'Arcy and Kenrich Monk punished for photos by AOC.

The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Akshay Kumar, Zayed Khan and Lara Dutta in lead roles, whilst Katrina Kaif stars in a cameo appearance. Kylie Minogue appears in a musical number in the film. Blue released during Diwali festival on 16 October 2009 and received mixed to positive response from critics. During the time of release, it was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release, produced with a budget of more than $25 million. Loosely based on the Hollywood film Into the Blue (2005), Blue failed to recover its high budget from the box office. Plot An opening scene shows a famous ship, Lady in Blue, sinking into a storm, and a lone survivor, Captain Jagat Malhotra (Kabir Bedi) emerging on the sea shore. Somewhere in the Bahamas, Aarav Malhotra (Akshay Kumar) runs a successful fishing company under the title of Blue Fisheries. He shares a good bond with Sagar Singh (Sanjay Dutt) who works as a diver for Aarav's fishing company. Sagar is in a relationship with Mahima \\"Mona\\" Dutta (Lara Dutta) and plans to marry her. Meanwhile, Sagar's younger brother Sameer \\"Sam\\" Singh (Zayed Khan) is based in Bangkok. Sam is a bike rider, and meets Nikita \\"Nikki\\" Malhotra (Katrina Kaif), a female biker who works for an underworld gangster named Gulshan Samnani (Rahul Dev). Sam is challenged by Gulshan to a bike race, and after Sam wins, he asks Nikki out for dinner. Before leaving, Gulshan asks Sam to work for him, but Sam refuses unless there's a large sum of money involved. During Sam's date with Nikki, Nikki explains to Sam that the job Gulshan proposed would pay with $50,000. Gulshan hires Sam to work for him, but Sam is set up by Gulshan in failing to deliver a package costing Gulshan $50 million. Sam must either pay his money back or die. Sam does not have the money so he explains to Nikki, whom he now loves, that he is going on holiday to the Bahamas to visit his brother Sagar and doesn't think Gulshan will find him there. Sam arrives at Aarav's company and Sagar welcomes him happily. In the Bahamas, one ill-fated day, when sitting in a restaurant, Sam receives a call from Gulshan on Nikki's phone, explaining that he has killed Nikki, and knows where Sam was. At the same time, as he gets out of the restaurant, Sam is confronted by Gulshan and his crew, who surround Sam, and chase him on bikes. Aarav enters and brings everyone to a halt by shooting the bike wheels, saving Sam's life. For now, Sam tells Aarav what he did wrong, and Aarav decides he needs to tell Sagar about the situation. When Sagar learns how much trouble Sam is in, Sam tries to convince Sagar to retrieve a famous treasure from Lady in Blue. Sagar refuses. The next day, Gulshan bombs Sagar's home, and kidnaps Mona, with a ransom of $50 million or Sam for her return. When Sagar tells Sam and Aarav, Sam decides that they need to go and rescue Mona as they already killed Nikki and will kill Mona too. But Aarav speaks up and says they don't know how far Gulshan is connected and they may all die, meaning the only option is to find the treasure, pay off Gulshan and use the rest of the money to live comfortably. Sagar is still hesitant and it is revealed that Sagar has a haunted and shocking past with Lady in Blue. Years ago, Sagar had to abandon his archaeologist father, Aadesh Singh, at the ship, to save his own life. However, after Aarav convinces Sagar that the treasure will save the lives of both Mona and Sam, Sagar finally agrees. The three of them bring the treasure up and find Gulshan sitting on the top of his ship that he and his gang have steered up next to the ship belonging to Sam, Sagar, and Aarav. He tells Sam and Sagar that Aarav hired Gulshan to do all of this. Soon there is a fight between Sagar and Aarav, and Aarav jumps into the ocean after killing Gulshan. Mona, Sam, and Sagar are forced to leave him there, and Sagar agrees never to come back to the Lady in Blue, after losing two people who were close to him there - his father Aadesh and his friend Aarav. Three months later, Sagar gets a call from Aarav. Talking to them, Aarav reveals that he survived his leap into the ocean, and reveals to them that his grandfather was Captain Jagat Malhotra, the traitorous captain of the ship, Lady in Blue, who committed suicide after he was court-martialed. Aarav never admitted to Sagar who his grandfather was, because he didn't want to dishonor his family. Aarav explains that finding the treasure of the Lady in Blue would help bring honor back to his family name, and he befriended Sagar, knowing he was the only one who could take him to the treasure. Throughout the phone call, a woman's arm is seen around Aarav, and later, the woman asks to speak to Sam. It is revealed that the woman is Nikki, and she is Aarav's wife. She asks Sam to forgive her for deceiving him, but it isn't revealed if Sam said yes or no. However, while Sam answers there is a smile on Nikki's face.

The semblance is made more joyful with the 'talla' attached externally to the mask giving the appearance of a toothless open mouth. Dancers also hold and manipulate long sticks of residuary agricultural produce called 'Kummattikali': it is from this that the dance derives its name. Their dance is related to Shaiva myth. 'Thamma' (an old woman) walks in front with the help of a stick. Thamma is symbolic of mother of every being and everything. Kummatti dancers are a sight to watch as they move around from house to house collecting jaggery, rice, or small amounts of cash.

The 4th generation (the Smithe Sisters), all daughters of Walter III, are Maureen Smithe (buyer), Meghan Smithe (director of marketing), Caitie Smithe (designer, design coordinator and stylist) and Colleen Smithe (director of advertising). History The company began in 1945 as Tone Appliances and Furniture, a single store on Belmont Avenue in Chicago. Walter E. Smithe and Bill Shanahan founded the store anticipating a booming economy in the wake of World War II. The two renamed the store Smithe and Shanahan, but Bill Shanahan eventually sold his share to Smithe's brother Charlie. Walter E. Smithe, Jr. joined the business in the 1960s with his brother Gary and Tom, and began phasing out appliances to focus on custom upholstery. In the 1970‚Äôs Walter left Smithe and Shanahan (His brothers remained with the original company) to start his own company - Walter E. Smithe.

The slogans \\"You dream it, we build it\\", or \\"That's Smithe, with an E\\" are commonly used. The company's commercials were originally straightforward descriptions of their products and services, but in 2003, the brothers decided to include outtakes from past filmings, which showed the brothers stumbling over words and laughing at each other. The Smithes had been encouraged to air their outtakes on television after Tim Smithe screened them at an interior design seminar and received a positive reaction from the crowd. This began a long series of lighthearted television commercials, which became increasingly elaborate over the next few years.William Hageman. \\"Sibling revelry ; Their offbeat commercials have made the Smithe brothers cult heroes.

Their paper A low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell based on dye- sensitized colloidal TiO2 films, published in 1991 in the journal, Nature, spawned a new research field and a new route to harvest electrical power from sunlight. Since that time Michael Gr√§tzel, now at Switzerland's √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL), has received numerous awards and accolades in relation to the invention of DSCs, and maintained close links to Dyesol as Chairman of Dyesol's Technical Advisory Board. Major differences between DSC & ssDSC From 1994, STI and Greatcell teams in Australia and Switzerland developed DSC technology and established the world's first DSC prototype manufacturing facility in Australia in 2000. Key to that development phase was the invention of processes, new materials, and equipment to manufacture DSC products. Dyesol acquired the laboratory, manufacturing equipment and intellectual property which has resulted in a large portfolio of patents. Dyesol further acquired STI in 2006 and Greatcell in 2007. Dyesol Limited was formed in 2004 to accelerate the commercial development of DSC technology and build on the DSC work of previous 14 years carried out by Sustainable Technologies International Pty Ltd (\\"STI\\"), Greatcell Solar S.A. (\\"Greatcell\\"), and Switzerland's √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL).

Transparent Tandem DSC on Glass In May 2013 Dyesol announced that Dye-sensitized Solar Cell (DSC) technology has achieved a technical breakthrough by achieving a solid-state DSC (ss-DSC) efficiency of 11.3% at full sun. The technology is particularly important in solar markets where light conditions are sub-optimal, such as Europe, North America and North-East Asia, or low-light conditions (such as indoor applications) where much higher efficiencies over 30% can be achieved. Solid State DSC efficiency against Liquid DSC On July 11, 2013 Dyesol /EPFL announced a new record DSC efficiency. Michael Gr√§tzel stated \\"Our research work on solid-state Dye Solar Cells (ss-DSC) is now achieving efficiencies exceeding 15%\\".https://actu.epfl.ch/news/dye-sensitized-solar-cells-rival-conventional- ce-2/ However, this is now considered a perovskite solar cell and the official accredited DSC solar cell efficiency is 11.9% determined by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/pdfs/pv- efficiencies-07-17-2018.pdf This efficiency is not expected to greatly increase as the DSC field has largely shifted to the development of perovskite solar cells which have achieved certified efficiencies over 23%.https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/pdfs/pv-efficiencies-07-17-2018.pdf Dyesol ssDSC on Steel (Solar Steel)  Subsidiaries and Partnerships  PV Accelerator Pilot Line 2 Subsidiaries * Dyesol-Timo Co Ltd ( ssDSC & Liquid DSC on Glass / Polymers / Steel ) South Korea * Dyesol Automotive Bavaria GmbH ( ssDSC & Liquid DSC for Automotive) Germany * Dyesol-Printed Power Pte Ltd (Research into Combined Energy Generation and Storage (CEGS)).

Sancaktar Hayrettin Mosque (; also Sancaktar Hayrettin Mescidi, where Mescit is the Turkish word for a small mosque, or Sancaktar Mescidi) is part of a former Eastern Orthodox monastery converted into a mosque by the Ottomans. It is generally believed that the small building belonged to the Byzantine Monastery of Gastria (, Monƒì t≈çn Gastr√≠≈çn, meaning \\"Monastery of the Vases\\"). The edifice is a minor example of Palaiologan architecture in Constantinople, and is important for historical reasons. Location The medieval structure, choked by artisan shops, lies in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood of Kocamustafapa≈üa (historically Samatya), on Teberdar Sokak, about five hundred meters north east of the Kocamustafapa≈üa station of the suburban railway line between Sirkeci and Halkalƒ±. History The origin of this building, which lies on the southern slope of the seventh hill of Constantinople and overlooks the Sea of Marmara, is not certain. The tradition says that in year 325 Helena, the mother of Constantine I, coming back from Jerusalem with the True Cross and entering the City through the Port tou Psomatheou, left in this place some vases (\\"Gastria\\") containing aromatic herbs collected on Calvary. Then she founded there a nunnery.Janin (1953), p. 72. In reality, no monastery was established in Constantinople before the last quarter of the fourth century, so this has to be considered only a legend. The southeast side with a particular of the brickwork. The nunnery of Gastria was first mentioned at the beginning of the ninth century.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 194. At that time Theoktiste, mother of Empress Theodora (wife of Emperor Theophilos and restorer of the cult of the icons)Mamboury (1953), p. 257. bought in the quarter of Psamathia a house from the Patrician Niketas (possibly Saint Nicetas the Patrician), and established there a nunnery. The title of Ktƒìtorissa (foundress), together with the property of the buildings, was inherited by her daughter Theodora. Together with her daughters Thekla, Anna, Anastasia and Pulcheria, Theodora was removed to the monastery by her brother Bardas after her deposition as regent for her son, Michael III, in 856. All of them were forced to accept the tonsure,Garland (1999), p. 105 although her eldest daughter, Thekla, was eventually recalled by Michael to serve as a mistress for his favourite, Basil the Macedonian. The 10th-century emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos writes in his book De Ceremoniis that the church of the nunnery served also as a mausoleum for the members of Theodora's family. The Empress, her brother Petronas, her mother and her three daughters were all buried there.According to Constantine VII, the mandible of Bardas was also kept in a marble casket in the church. Janin (1953), p. 73. The last mention of Gastria before 1453 comes from a Russian pilgrim, who visited the City during the second quarter of the fifteenth century. He remembers a nunnery placed near the Golden Gate, where the relics of Saint Euphemia and Saint Eudokia were venerated.Janin (1953), p. 73. This building could well be identified with Gastria. Shortly after the Fall of Constantinople, Hayrettin Effendi, Sancaktar (standard-bearer) of Sultan Mehmed II, converted the building into a mescit (oratory) and was buried there. The charter for this religious foundation has not survived. The 1894 Istanbul earthquake, which had its epicentre under the Sea of Marmara, partially destroyed the mosque, which was restored only between 1973 and 1976. Description Due to its small dimension, the building cannot be identified with the church of the nunnery, but rather with a martyrion (burial chapel) or a mausoleum, which can be dated to the Palaiologan period (14th century). The building had the shape of an irregular octagon with a cross-shaped interior and an apse oriented toward East. Light penetrates into the building through windows opened on alternate sides, which illuminate the arms of the cross-shaped interior. Each window is inside a blind arch which spans the whole side. The masonry uses alternate courses of brick and ashlar, giving to the exterior the polychromy typical of the Palaiologan period.Eyice (1955), p. 90. Remnants of walls still present in the northwest and south sides before the restoration showed that the building was not isolated, but connected with other edifices. A minaret has also been added to the restored building.

He founded the Nava Telangana Praja Party (NTP) to fight for separate statehood for Telangana region in Andhra Pradesh but later returned to his parent outfit. A backward classes leader, he served as a cabinet minister for BC welfare and Prohibition portfolios in N.T. Rama Rao's cabinet. He has also worked as a cabinet minister handling Revenue and Home portfolios under Nara Chandrababu Naidu. He was elected three times to the Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh from Medchal assembly constituency as a representative of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). He was a TDP politbureau member since 1991, deputy leader of TDP legislature party in the AP legislative assembly and was considered number two leader, next only to Nara Chandrababu Naidu in TDP before he resigned to fight for separate statehood of Telangana state. Personal details Tulla Devender Goud was born on 18 March 1953 at Thukkuguda village of Maheswaram mandal, in the Rangareddy district of Telangana, to Tulla Sayanna Goud and Sathemma. He did his bachelors in commerce from Badruka college at Hyderabad, Telangana. He married Vinoda in 1978, and together they had three sons Vijayender, Vinayender, and Veerender Goud. Political career Goud was elected as a student leader while at college. He then joined N.T. Rama Rao's new political party, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and was elected Chairman of the Zilla Parishad for Rangareddy district. He became the TDP candidate for Medchal assembly constituency six months prior to the scheduled elections of 1994 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, and was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for that constituency in 1994. Goud became a member of Rao's cabinet with responsibility for three independent portfolios: Backward Classes welfare, Co- operation, and Total Prohibition. He became Revenue Minister in Nara Chandrababu Naidu's cabinet after the latter rebelled against Rao in 1995. He was re-elected as MLA for Medchal in 1999 with a margin of over 77,000 votes. Subsequently, he became minister for Home, Jails, Fire services, NCC, Sainik Welfare, Film Development Corporation and Cinematography in Naidu's cabinet. In 2004 he won a record-third term from the Medchal constituency, despite a statewide wave of anti-incumbency against the TDP government, as well as in favour of a separate Telangana state. The TDP lost those elections to the Indian National Congress (INC), and Goud was appointed as TDP deputy leader in the legislative assembly. Subsequently, there were problems perceived in the Telangana regions by the diversion of water from the Krishna and Godavari rivers to other areas, and by the manner in which the INC sidelined its election promise to separate Telangana as an independent state. Furthermore, there were sales of public lands in the Telangana region and there was a lack of representation for the people of the region people in the local job market, including in administrative and bureaucratic posts. Goud believed that Telangana leaders should fight against these perceived injustices and organized a padayatra (procession on foot) from Pranahitha to Chevella in protest. This was well received in Telangana and forced the TDP to support the idea of separate Telangana statehood in the May 2008 by-elections. Following the by-elections the TDP retreated from its promise of separate statehood and instead constituted a committee to decide the issue. Goud now thought that both the INC and TDP were procrastinating and were not particularly in favour of the idea, so he resigned from his legislative assembly seat and from the TDP in June 2008 in protest. He then organized a Telangana Sadhana Samithi discussion with scholars and professors from the Telangana regions to discuss future action. This meeting was attended by 3000 delegates including Praja Gayakudu Gaddar, Konda Laxman Bapuji, Mallepalli Laxmaiah and Tirumali. On 9 July 2008 he organized a convention of Telangana students at Osmania University to explain his resignation from the TDP and his plans to lead non- violent agitation for statehood. He stressed the importance of participation of students in fighting for the statehood of Telangana without violence as happened between 1967 and 1971. On 11 July 2008 Goud announced a new political party, the Nava Telangana Praja Party, to fight for Telangana statehood. However, it was soon decided to merge this with the Praja Rajyam Party. While the official reason for the merger is said to be common ideology of the two parties‚Äîsocial justice and separate Telangana, the reality is that Goud has been finding it difficult to run the party as it had failed to create the kind of impact he expected before he quit TDP on 23 June 2008 therefore watching out for his political future the decision was made about the merger. Goud lost both the parliamentary and assembly elections in 2009. Then, on 3 August 2009, Goud resigned from the Praja Rajyam Party and announced that he would rejoin the TDP. In 2012, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a TDP candidate.

It is an analog of sildenafil (Viagra) which has been detected in numerous different brands of supposedly \\"herbal\\" aphrodisiac products sold to boost libido and alleviate erectile dysfunction. A range of designer analogs of licensed PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and vardenafil have been detected in recent years in over-the-counter herbal aphrodisiac products, in an apparent attempt to circumvent both the legal restrictions on sale of erectile dysfunction drugs, which are prescription-only medicines in most Western countries, and the patent protection which allows sale of these drugs by competitors only with permission from the patent holders (typically, under a license from the inventors) and to introduce efficacy into otherwise ineffective herbal products. These compounds have been demonstrated to display PDE5 inhibitory activity in vitro and presumably have similar effects when consumed, but have undergone no formal testing in either humans or animals, and as such may represent significant health risks to consumers of these products due to their unknown safety profile. Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs as unlicensed medicines, but progress has been slow so far, as even in those jurisdictions which have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogs of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogs of prescription medicines. However, at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market.

The reasoning is that any collection of random samples from a process must represent the average statistical properties of the entire process. In other words, regardless of what the individual samples are, a birds-eye view of the collection of samples must represent the whole process. Conversely, a process that is not ergodic is a process that changes erratically at an inconsistent rate.Originally due to L. Boltzmann. See part 2 of ('Ergoden' on p.89 in the 1923 reprint.) It was used to prove equipartition of energy in the kinetic theory of gases  Specific definitions  One can discuss the ergodicity of various statistics of a stochastic process. For example, a wide-sense stationary process X(t) has constant mean :\\\\mu_X= E[X(t)], and autocovariance :r_X(\\\\tau) = E[(X(t)-\\\\mu_X) (X(t+\\\\tau)-\\\\mu_X)], that depends only on the lag \\\\tau and not on time t. The properties \\\\mu_X and r_X(\\\\tau) are ensemble averages not time averages. The process X(t) is said to be mean-ergodicPapoulis, p.428 or mean-square ergodic in the first momentPorat, p.14 if the time average estimate :\\\\hat{\\\\mu}_X = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\int_{0}^{T} X(t) \\\\, dt converges in squared mean to the ensemble average \\\\mu_X as T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. Likewise, the process is said to be autocovariance-ergodic or d moment if the time average estimate :\\\\hat{r}_X(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\int_{0}^{T} [X(t+\\\\tau)-\\\\mu_X] [X(t)-\\\\mu_X] \\\\, dt converges in squared mean to the ensemble average r_X(\\\\tau), as T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. A process which is ergodic in the mean and autocovariance is sometimes called ergodic in the wide sense.  Discrete-time random processes  The notion of ergodicity also applies to discrete-time random processes X[n] for integer n. A discrete-time random process X[n] is ergodic in mean if :\\\\hat{\\\\mu}_X = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} X[n] converges in squared mean to the ensemble average E[X], as N \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty.  Examples Ergodicity means the ensemble average equals the time average. Following are examples to illustrate this principle. =Call centre= Each operator in a call centre spends time alternately speaking and listening on the telephone, as well as taking breaks between calls. Each break and each call are of different length, as are the durations of each 'burst' of speaking and listening, and indeed so is the rapidity of speech at any given moment, which could each be modelled as a random process. * Take N call centre operators (N should be a very large integer) and plot the number of words spoken per minute for each operator over a long period (several shifts). For each operator you will have a series of points, which could be joined with lines to create a 'waveform'. * Calculate the average value of those points in the waveform; this gives you the time average. * There are N waveforms and N operators. These N waveforms are known as an ensemble. * Now take a particular instant of time in all those waveforms and find the average value of the number of words spoken per minute. That gives you the ensemble average for that instant. * If ensemble average always equals time average, then the system is ergodic. =Electronics= Each resistor has an associated thermal noise that depends on the temperature. Take N resistors (N should be very large) and plot the voltage across those resistors for a long period. For each resistor you will have a waveform. Calculate the average value of that waveform; this gives you the time average. There are N waveforms as there are N resistors. These N plots are known as an ensemble. Now take a particular instant of time in all those plots and find the average value of the voltage. That gives you the ensemble average for each plot. If ensemble average and time average are the same then it is ergodic. Examples of non-ergodic random processes * An unbiased random walk is non-ergodic. Its expectation value is zero at all times, whereas its time average is a random variable with divergent variance. * Suppose that we have two coins: one coin is fair and the other has two heads. We choose (at random) one of the coins first, and then perform a sequence of independent tosses of our selected coin. Let X[n] denote the outcome of the nth toss, with 1 for heads and 0 for tails. Then the ensemble average is ( + 1) = ; yet the long-term average is for the fair coin and 1 for the two-headed coin. So the long term time-average is either 1/2 or 1. Hence, this random process is not ergodic in mean.

It was first named by Broom in 1913 Broom, R. \\"On the Gorgonopsia, a Sub-order of the Mammal-like Reptiles.\\" Proceedings of the general meetings for scientific business of the Zoological Society of London. (1913): 225-230., and contains two species, S. bigendens, and S. capensis. Its fossils have been found in South Africa and Zambia. It is believed to be closely related to the Gorgonopsian Sauroctonus progressus. Scylacops was a moderately sized Gorgonopsid . Scylacops is an carnivorous therapsid, existing from 259.0 to 254.0 Ma. S. bigendens was first described by Brink and James Kitching in 1953, although its original description was Sycocephalus bigendens Brink, A. S., and J. W. Kitching. \\"Studies on new specimens of the Gorgonopsia.\\" Palaeontologia africana 1 (1953): 1-28.. According to the paleobiology database Scylacops specimens have been found in the following locations in South Africa; Uitsspansfontein at Beaufort West, Dunedin, Wellwood, and Sondagsriviershoek. Scylacops is also known from Zambia.Battail, Bernard, and Mikhail V. Surkov. \\"Mammal-like reptiles from Russia.\\" The age of dinosaurs in Russia and Mongolia (2000): 86-119..  Systematics  Although there have been multiple alignments for Scylacops within Gorgonopsidae starting with Broom's original declaration that Scylacops is ‚Äúallied with Gorgonops torous,‚Äù morphological similarities point to it as a close relative of Sauroctonus progressus . Battail & Surkov described Gorgonopsinae a subfamily of Gorgonopsidae. However, now only Rubidgeinae is recognized as a sub-family of Gorgonopsidae Kammerer, Christian, F. \\" Systematics of the Rubidgeinae (Therapsida: Gorgonopsia).\\" PeerJ 4. 1608 (2016): 1-109.. Because Battail & Surkov diagnosed Scylacops as Gorgonopsinae, a description of Gorgonopsinae is warranted. Gorgonopsinae is diagnosed by a thin zygomatic arch, a ventrally extended edge of posterior cranial roof, an often present preparietal and a post temporal fossa oriented horizontally . Because of the research and analysis of Battail & Surkov, a phylogeny which includes Scylacops as sister Sauroctonus to can be inferred. Because of Scylacops‚Äô relationships in the Therapsid clade. Broom describes the key morphological differences between Gorgonopsia and Therocephalia. Gorgonopsia have a broad parietal region vs a narrow one in Therocephalians. Gorgonopsians have a preparietal while Therocephalians do not. Gorgonopsians have a large post frontal while Therocephalians have a small one. Gorgonopsians have a single true vomer while Therocephalians have a pair of prevomers. Gorgonopsians have strong mandible symphysis while Therocephalians have loosely articulated jaws. Gorgonopsians have an angular with a deep grove while they are perforated in Therocephalians . Analysis showing cyclical growth in cortical fibrolamellar bone tissue in Scylacops and gorgonopsians as a whole is one reason they are considered more distantly related to crown Mammilla. Early‚ÄìMiddle Triassic non-mammalian cynodonts Cynognathus and Early Jurassic Tritylodon exhibit rapid, sustained growth and are placed closer to crown Mammilla Botha, Jennifer, and Anusuya Chinsamy. \\"Growth patterns of Thrinaxodon liorhinus, a non‚Äêmammalian cynodont from the Lower Triassic of South Africa.\\" Palaeontology 48.2 (2005): 385-394..  Description/Morphology  A Lateral view diagnoses include a large septomaxilla, a large prefrontal which meets the post- frontal and shuts out the frontal from the orbital margin, and the increased forward extension of the zygomatic portion of the squamosal. Dorsal view diagnoses include a large frontal which does not reach the orbital margins, behind the frontal is a large postfrontal bounded by the prefrontal, the frontal, the parietal, and the postorbital . Scylacops has 5 incisors 1 canine and 3 molars . Scylacops has a similar occipital region to Lycaenops ornatus, another gorgonopsian discovered by Broom in 1920. Its occipital region is described with the following characteristics. The interparietal is a large broad bone between the parietal and supraoccipital. The interparietal is entirely on the occipital face. Below it lies a large broad supraoccipital forming the upper margin of the foramen magnum. The interparietal articulates inferiorly with the exoccipital and the opisthotic with the tabular forming the outer portion of the occiput. Above the interparietal is articulation with the parietal and the squamosal. As part of the articulation with the quadrate is a long process lying against the squamosal externally and the opisthotic internally. The exoccipitals are small and form the lateral walls of the foramen magnum Broom, R. ‚ÄúOn the Structure of the Mammal-Like Reptiles of the Sub-Order Gorgonopsia.‚Äù Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character 218 (1930): 345‚Äì371.. Sauroctonus progressus Battail & Surkov describe Scylacops as the closest overall morphological relative to the Russian gorgonopsine Sauroctonus progressus. Battail & Surkov diagnose S. progressus by small orbits, a skull narrow posteriorly, infraorbital and temporal widths are very narrow, the postorbital bar widens ventrally with transverse flanges of pterygoids, and has 4-6 upper post canine teeth. Like Scylacops it is considered a medium- sized gorgonopsid . Scylacops SAM-PK-10188 from the Iziko South African Museum has measurements as follows; Humerus 100 mm, Radii 83.25 mm, Ulna 99 mm, Femur 174.8 mm, Fibula, 96.67 mm Ray, Sanghamitra, Jennifer Botha & Anusuya Chinsamy. ‚ÄúBone histology and growth patterns of some nonmammalian therapsids.‚Äù Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 24.3 (2004): 634-648..  Histology  Therapsids have quick osteogenesis in the cortical fibrolamellar bone tissue. Analysis of Scylacops sp. specimen SAM-PK-10188 from Dunedin shows a cyclical and zonal growth pattern. This cyclical growth is a strong effect of Scylacops‚Äô environment. Scylacops‚Äô cortical fibrolamellar bone tissue shows a phylogenic relationship between Scylacops and the gorgonopsid from the Rubidgeinae sub-family Aelurognathus. However, there is a clear distinction between the two. Scylacops was distinctly cyclical with intermediate growth, where periods of fast growth were interrupted by periods of slow growth or halting of growth. Aelurognathus sustained fast growth early in ontogeny only to be interrupted at a later stage of growth . Aelurognathus tigriceps SAM-PK-10188‚Äôs histology shows wide zones separated by annuli and LAGs. These wide zones are composed of a woven-fibered bone matrix with mainly longitudinally oriented channels and osteonal deposits forming primary osteons and fibrolamellar bone tissue. The outer cortical periphery is irregular with few channels opening subperiosteally. The longitudinally oriented channels in this region show few osteonal deposits and are larger than well-developed primary osteons. Organization of primary osteons varies depending on the element and even locally within the same section. The medullary cavity in all the elements are lined by endosteally lamellated bone the extent of which varies depending on the position and type of element. Secondary reconstruction is prevalent in the inner cortex resulting in enlarged resorption cavities .  Stratigraphy  The Cistecephalus zone is regarding the biostratigraphy of a genus of burrowing dicynodont from the late Permian of South Africa Palmer, D., ed. The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals. London: Marshall Editions 1999.. The strata assigned to the zone is made from gray-green, bluish-green, purple and reddish mudstone with lenticular sandstone and siltstone beds. Fossils mostly are found in mudstone horizons lasting several miles. The Uitsspansfontein locality in Beaufort west is characterized by a low relief and small exposures covering strata immediately below the Cistecephalus band Kitching, James W. The distribution of the Karroo vertebrate fauna: with special reference to certain genera and the bearing of this distribution on the zoning of the Beaufort Beds. University of the Witwatersrand, 1977.. Beaufort biostratigraphy is made up of five zones, the Daptocephalus, Cistecephalus, Tropidostoma, Pristerognathus and Tapinocephalus. The Cistecephalus zone has an age range of around 257 to 255 ma. Beaufort West is lithographically siliciclastic. The Geologic age in which Scylacops lived across all sites, is the Wuchiapingian, Late Permian Groenewald et al. \\"Vertebrate assemblages from the north-central Main Karoo Basin, South Africa, and their implications for mid-Permian biogeography.\\" Lethaia 52 (2019): 486-501.. Parts of the upper Cistecephalus zone may be referenced as Endothiodon zone due to many endothiodont specimens found by Broom and Von Huene directly above the recognized Cistecephalus zone. However, there is no lithological distinction between the two rock beds. They both consist of the same identical gray-green and bluish-green and purple mudstone and shale sediments, interbedded with lenticular sandstone and siltstones. Kitching proposes that the varied color of mudstones and lenticular sandstones are not reliable markers of separation as they do not follow a consistent stratigraphical plane but are sporadic across the Beaufort series . The only location outside of South Africa where Scylacops has been found is the Madumabisa Mudstone formation in the Drysdall and Kitching locality 3‚Äì4, Upper Luangwa Valley, Zambia.

A skilled linguist, he was in later life an educator, serving as professor of English at Hindu College, where he inspired the Bengali poet Michael Madhusudan Dutta.Shastri, Shibnath (1903) Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Bangasamaj, (Bengali), p 104, New Age Publishers Pvt. Ltd. Early life David Lester Richardson was born in London and baptised at St. Marylebone on 15 February 1801, son of Sarah Lester and Lt Col David Thomas Richardson (1780‚Äì1808) of the Bengal Army. He appears to have been born out of wedlock; David Thomas Richardson married Violet Oliver (c1780‚Äì1808) in August 1801. He, Violet and their three surviving children died when their ship, the Lord Nelson was lost in a storm around 21 or 22 November 1808 en route from Madras to England. Career Sketch by Colesworthey Grant David Lester Richardson entered into the service of the East India Company in 1819, and from that time began to submit poems to James Silk Buckingham's Calcutta Journal under initials which were to become well known in British India circles; D.L.R. His work included English language translations of Indian poems. He appears to have been wealthy; an uncle, Colonel Sherwood, is reported to have commented in connection with Richardson's aspiration to visit England, \\"You are the richest ensign in India. If you go home, you will return a beggar.\\" In 1822, he published a slim volume of poems under his full name - a work he was later ashamed of, presumably for its callow elements. He was granted medical leave to visit England in 1824; this first return trip to the mother-country lasted until 1829. In London he pursued his literary muse, publishing Sonnets and Other Poems in 1825, apparently to warm reviews. It was reprinted a number of times and a third edition was published in 1827 within the Jones Diamond Edition series on British Poets; Richardson was the only living poet to have his work included in the series. In 1827, he founded the London Weekly Review, a literary journal which he edited with James Augustus St. John, and on which he expended a considerable amount of his patrimony. Contributors include William Hazlitt, William Roscoe, John Bowring and Thomas Pringle; the enterprise appears to have been successful, at least enough to encourage an offer from John Murray, scion of the John Murray publishing house to purchase a half-share in the business. The offer was rejected; but a downturn in publishing and hence in advertising revenue for literary journals, and a need on Richard's part to return to his employers in India led him to enter into an agreement under which Henry Colburn would assume control of the journal in return for Richardson receiving a share in the profits of sales of the London Weekly Review. Colburn ingeniously renamed the publication as the Court Journal, and Richardson's anticipated rewards evaporated. Richardson's compulsion to return to India arose out of a statutory five-year limit on absence-from-post for officers of the East India company; he was by late 1828 at risk of overstaying. In October 1828 he applied to the company's Board of Control to return to India, and was instructed to embark in November; however his passage was delayed until December, causing him to arrive in India in 1829 later than agreed; for this he was suspended by the company for the next eighteen months, until the Board of Directors could rule on his future. Secure that they would find in his favour, Richardson once again threw himself into literary pursuits and in 1830 re-joined the company, being made a member of the Arsenal Committee in Calcutta, and shortly after promoted to captaincy. His company status secure, Richardson immediately applied for and was granted a transfer to the invalid list. His time from 1829 to 1835 was for the most part spend editing journals, including seven volumes of the Bengal Annual, six volumes of the Calcutta Literary Gazette and twelve volumes of the Calcutta Magazine. In the same period he brought out two books of his poetry, Ocean, Sketches and Other Poems (1833) and Literary Leaves (1835), both regarded in 1839 as his principal works. In the early part of 1835 he was appointed aide- de camp to Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General of Bengal, but on Bentinck retiring from the post later in the year, Richardson was elected Professor of Literature at the Hindu College, apparently at the urging of Thomas Babington Macaulay; and at much the same time was commissioned by Macaulay and the Education Board to write a text-book - Selections from the British Poets... - to support his teaching, for which he was promised a subscription of 2,000 copies from the Board. In 1839 he was promoted to be principal of the Hindu College. In 1845 he became principal of Krishnagarh College (though not its collegiate school), and in 1848 principal of the Hindu Metropolitan College. Macaulay would no doubt have been delighted that Shibnath Shastri wrote: Richardson retired from Indian service in 1861, and returned to England where he became proprietor and editor of The Court Circular, and editor of Allen's Indian Mail. He died on 17 November 1865 at Clapham. Family Richardson married Marian Scott (c1801‚Äì1865), daughter of a Col Scott, in Danapur on 8 Jan 1821. They had four daughters and three sons: * David Charles Thomas Richardson (1822‚Äì?), born in Danapur * Lester Williams Richardson (1827‚Äì1835), born in St Pancras, died in Greenwich, Kent * Jessy Hay Richardson (1831‚Äì1834), born and died in Singapore * Isabella Caroline Richardson (1833‚Äì1903), born in Calcutta, married Rev John Reuben Hill (1838‚Äì1924) in Kanpur in 1872, died in Canterbury, Kent * Violet Richardson (1837‚Äì1857), born in India, died in Chinsurah * Marion Annie Richardson (1838‚Äì1914), born in Calcutta, married Adam Johnson (1838‚Äì1914) a Captain in HEICo Merchant fleet in Freemantle in 1859, died in South Australia. * William Scott Richardson (1840‚Äì1894), born in Bengal, Captain in the 25th Kings Own Borderers, died in San Francisco.

He was later hired by KESQ in Palm Desert, California as a weekend weather anchor and eventually morning weather anchor once KESQ launched its weekday morning newscast. Less than two years later, Mayeda joined KSBY in San Luis Obispo, California as a weekend weather anchor and news reporter. Mayeda took on the same role for KCRA in Sacramento, California in 1997. Mayeda earned an Emmy award in 2002 for \\"On Camera News: Weather\\" from the Northern California National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. He was also nominated for another Emmy in 2008 as segment producer for \\"From Dreams To Dust,\\" a documentary about the Japanese American internment camps during World War II. He worked as a weekday weather anchor for KIRO-TV in Seattle, Washington for two years before returning to California where he was hired at KNTV. Mayeda was recently assigned to weekend morning and evening newscasts while working on news special projects. Mayeda's work as a videographer/producer aired on NBC Bay Area for \\"On Thin Ice\\", a climate change special focusing on Alaska's melting glaciers. The American Meteorological Society awarded \\"On Thin Ice\\" its \\"Excellence in Science Reporting by a Broadcast Meteorologist\\" honor in October 2011.

He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987. Life He went to Douai College in 1574, as one of the earliest seminary students there, and studied theology. The next year he was made subdeacon, and accompanied Dominic Vaughan to England. In Essex they fell into the hands of the Government, December 1576, and under examination, Vaughan gave the names of Catholics both in London and Essex. They were then handed over by the Privy Council to the Archbishop of Canterbury for further examination, but nothing more was elicited, and they were afterwards set at liberty. Scott returned to Douai on 22 May 1577, and having been ordained priest at Brussels set out for the English mission on 17 June. The vessel in which he crossed to England was attacked by pirates, but he escaped with some loss of his goods. In 1578, he was captured at Cambridge and sent to London by the University's Vice-Chancellor \\"with all such books, letters, writings, and other trash which were taken about them\\", but eventually released. He is mentioned as having laboured in Kent (1580), Norfolk, Suffolk (1583), Lincolnshire and Yorkshire (1584). On 24 April 1584, John Nedeham and others were indicted at Norwich for having, on 1 June 1582, received blessed beads from him. In 1584 he was captured at York at brought to London, where he remained a prisoner for seven years. His release was procured by a money payment of one Baker, on condition of his leaving the country, but Richard Topcliffe immediately procured his re-arrest. Meanwhile he had visited the Catholics in Wisbech Castle. He was brought to trial at the sessions at Newgate, with George Beesley (30 June 1591), and was condemned on account of his priesthood and of his being in the country contrary to the statute. The next day he was drawn to Fleet Street, where he was executed.

It is the problem of optimizing (minimizing or maximizing) a function of two vector variables subject to certain requirements (constraints) which include: that the inner product of the two vectors must equal zero, i.e. they are orthogonal. In particular for finite-dimensional real vector spaces this means that, if one has vectors X and Y with all nonnegative components (xi ‚â• 0 and yi ‚â• 0 for all i: in the first quadrant if 2-dimensional, in the first octant if 3-dimensional), then for each pair of components xi and yi one of the pair must be zero, hence the name complementarity. e.g. X = (1, 0) and Y = (0, 2) are complementary, but X = (1, 1) and Y = (2, 0) are not. A complementarity problem is a special case of a variational inequality. History Complementarity problems were originally studied because the Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker conditions in linear programming and quadratic programming constitute a linear complementarity problem (LCP) or a mixed complementarity problem (MCP). In 1963 Lemke and Howson showed that, for two person games, computing a Nash equilibrium point is equivalent to an LCP. In 1968 Cottle and Dantzig unified linear and quadratic programming and bimatrix games. Since then the study of complementarity problems and variational inequalities has expanded enormously. Areas of mathematics and science that contributed to the development of complementarity theory include: optimization, equilibrium problems, variational inequality theory, fixed point theory, topological degree theory and nonlinear analysis.

His chemistry work of note largely involved wood and waterproofing. His only chemistry book was The chemistry of cellulose and wood, but he had 34 patents. In ornithology his first major paper came in 1929‚Äì1931. In 1951 he became a fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union. He also did some work in mammalogy. In 1958 he won the Brewster Medal. Biography Arlie William Schorger was born in Republic, Ohio, on September 6, 1884. He attended Wooster College, receiving a Bachelor of Philosophy in chemistry. He secured an assistantship at Ohio State University and later graduated there with a Master of Arts in 1908. He found a job with the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., testing materials to ensure they were adhering to national specifications. Schorger quickly tired of this work and took a job as an assistant chemist with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. He was transferred to the Forest Products Laboratory of the US Forest Service at Madison, Wisconsin. There, he analyzed wood samples from trees and attended graduate school at the nearby University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Schorger graduated with a Ph.D in 1916 with a thesis on coniferous tree oils. He was hired by the C. F. Burgess Laboratories as the Director of Chemical Research. Schorger was awarded several patents for his work on mucic acid and lignin production, wood gelatin, and waterproofing. He published his only chemistry book, The Chemistry of Cellulose and Wood, in 1926. When the company spun off the Burgess Cellulose Company in 1931, Schorger was named its president, overseeing its factory in Freeport, Illinois, and its offices in Madison. He retired from chemistry in 1950 with thirty-four patents to his name. A lifelong naturalist, Schorger decided to shift the focus of his career and pursue the wildlife management field. Schorger took field notes on birds from 1912 until 1971, making trips every Sunday. He became a member of the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) in 1913 and published his first ornithological paper in 1931. The AOU appointed him a Fellow in 1951, and Schorger would serve on its Council from 1959 to 1962. Schorger was appointed a Professor of Wildlife Management at Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison on November 10, 1951. He taught for four years until his retirement in 1955, upon which he was conferred the rank of professor emeritus. His collection of over 700 bird and animal skins, mostly from Dane County, were donated to Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison shortly before his death. He was the first to preserve the skin of a cougar found in Wisconsin and presented it to Lawrence College. Schorger also collected books on ornithology and mammalogy, eventually amassing 600 volumes. This collection was also donated to Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Schorger published The Passenger Pigeon: Its Natural History and Extinction in 1955 and The Wild Turkey: Its History and Domestication in 1966. The prior was the first book to be published on the species' history and extinction. From 1956 to 1959, Schorger served on the board of directors of the National Audubon Society. Schorger married Margaret F. Davison in 1912. They had two sons: William Davison, a professor at the University of Michigan, and John Roger, a professor at Metropolitan State University. After her death in 1962, Schorger changed his will to provide a bequest for a Margaret Davison Schorger Scholarship in Italian art. He went 90% blind after a retinal hemorrhage in 1971. Shortly thereafter, he was found to have inoperable bladder cancer, then broke his arm in January 1972. Schorger died on May 26, 1972.

Since its founding in 1978, it has played an important - though understated - role in the South African religious community. It is based in Glenhazel, Johannesburg. It was established and headed by Rosh Yeshiva Rabbi Azriel Goldfein until his death in 2007, and is now headed by his sons Rabbi Avraham and Rabbi David Goldfein. The Yeshiva accommodates students from across the spectrum of Orthodoxy. The Hirsch Lyons Primary and High Schools are associated with the Yeshivah. Rabbi Goldfein studied in Telz Yeshiva, under great rabbis who survived the Holocaust, and was a lifelong talmid muvhak (prominent student) of Rabbi Mordechai Gifter. During this time, he developed a \\"love of and profound knowledge of\\" the writings of the Maharal of Prague. With his wife Clarice Goldfein, he came to South Africa from the United States in 1972, \\"with a mission to establish an authentic, world-class yeshiva... for the training of South African rabbis for South Africa\\", and \\"Yeshivah Gedolah\\" was established the next year, originally based at the Yeshiva College of South Africa. Rabbi Avraham Goldfein studied at Telz in Cleveland for four years. In addition to studying at the Yeshivah Gedolah under his father, where he received semichah he also studied at Yeshivas Netzach Yisroel in Israel. Rabbi David Goldfein completed his schooling through correspondence and learnt under his father from the age of 15. The Yeshivah's derech (educational model) is built on two main approaches. Primarily, the Yeshivah follows the \\"Telshe derech\\", stressing Mussar (Ethics) and Derech eretz (character and behaviour) alongside Talmud study.‚ÄúThis derech is manifest in both the Talmudic lomdus (scholarship) and derech avoda (practice) in Machashava (\\"Jewish thought\\") and Mussar practiced in the Lithuanian Telshe‚Ä¶ a system unified and consistent across all areas of thought, analysis and endeavor.‚Äù Rabbi Yosef Gavriel Bechhofer, 120 Years Since the Founding of the Yeshiva. Secondly, and in complementary fashion, the derech of the Maharal influences the Yeshivah's approach to learning, and more particularly, its Hashkafa (\\"worldview\\", beliefs within Orthodox Judaism). Additional to these, there is a further and direct link to the Lithuanian yeshivas: In the 1980s, Rabbi Jacob SymanowitzSee Leon Feldberg, Editor.

He, in turn, had studied in Yeshiva Ohel Torah-Baranovich under Elchonon Wasserman, as well as in Mir and Slabodka and received semichah - Yadin Yadin - from Meyer Abovitz. Yeshivah Gedolah is known for its \\"uncomplicated approach to learning\\"Memorial article (consistent with the Maharal's approach to Torah study), and for its high standardsRabbinical Council of America List of Approved Yeshivot and thorough semichah programme, requiring that graduates \\"be talmidei chachamim (Talmudic scholars), and not just religious functionaries\\". The Yeshiva has trained dozens of South African rabbis, including Chief Rabbi Dr. Warren Goldstein. More than 50 shuls, 20 communal organisations and virtually all of South Africa's Jewish day schools have been served by its alumni. The yeshiva also provides learning opportunities and resources to the community. Over the decades, Rabbi Goldfein gave thousands of public lectures, including the very popular weekly Parashat ha-Shavua shiur, more than 1000 of which were recorded and are widely distributed.

He was apprenticed to a Liverpool cotton broker in 1853. By 1864 he was head of the Liverpool branch of James Finlay & Co., a large cotton business of Glasgow and Bombay. Smith was first elected to Parliament on 11 December 1882 in a by-election in Liverpool, following the Conservative MP Viscount Sandon's succession to the Peerage as Earl of Harrowby on 19 November 1882. The three-seat Liverpool constituency was split for the 1885 general election and Smith stood in the new Liverpool Abercromby seat. However, he lost to the Conservative candidate William Lawrence by 807 votes. He returned to Parliament in a by-election in Flintshire on 3 March 1886. This by-election followed the elevation to the Peerage of Lord Richard Grosvenor. Smith remained the seat's MP until he retired at the 1906 general election. He died later that year aged 70 at Calcutta, India. Edge Hill University has a hall of residence called Smith in honour of his contribution to the institution. He co-founded the university in 1885.

The battle took place during the period of increasing tension between France and China that eventually culminated in the Sino-French War (August 1884‚ÄìApril 1885).Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 166‚Äì7; Histoire militaire, 64‚Äì6  Background  The Battle of Palan was fought two weeks after the Battle of Ph·ªß Ho√†i, in which General Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87), the French commandant sup√©rieur in Tonkin, had failed to defeat Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army. Heavy flooding in mid-August had obliged the Black Flags to abandon their positions in front of the Day River and retreat behind the river. The key to their new positions were the villages of Phong (or Phung), commanding the main road to S∆°n T√¢y at its crossing of the Day River, and Palan (also known as Ba Giang), at the junction of the Red and Day rivers.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 64 Under pressure from Jules Harmand, the French civil commissioner general in Tonkin, Bou√´t attacked the new Black Flag positions at the end of August to clear the road to S∆°n T√¢y, the ultimate French objective. Bou√´t committed 1,800 French soldiers to this offensive. The French force consisted of two marine infantry battalions (chefs de bataillon Berger and Roux), each strengthened by contingents of Cochinchinese riflemen, one marine artillery battery (Captain Roussel) and a battalion of Yellow Flag auxiliaries.Roux's battalion consisted of the 25th, 26th and 27th Companies, 4th Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Drouin, Tacco√´n and Lancelot) and the 1st Annamese Rifle Company (Captain de Beauquesne). Berger's battalion consisted of the 26th and 27th Companies, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Doucet and Gu√©rin de Fontjoyeux) and the 2nd and 3rd Annamese Rifle Companies (Captains Boutet and Berger). The attackers were supported by the gunboats Pluvier, L√©opard, Fanfare, √âclair, Hache and Mousqueton from the Tonkin Flotilla, under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Morel- Beaulieu.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 65  The battle  Liu Yongfu (1837‚Äì1917) On 31 August the village of Palan, bombarded from the rear by the gunboats and attacked frontally by Berger's battalion, was captured without difficulty, and its defenders fled in disorder along the dyke. At dawn on 1 September the column advanced along a two-metre wide dyke which ran along the bank of the Day River towards its main objective: Phong, a principal point on the road to S∆°n T√¢y. Its front and left were screened by heavy skirmish lines of Tonkinese and Cochinchinese riflemen. Meanwhile, the gunboats ascended the Red River. Pluvier and Fanfare remained at the confluence of the Red and Day rivers to support an infantry company guarding Palan, while Mousqueton, √âclair and Hache moved up the Day to support the attack column. General Alexandre- Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87) Three kilometres from Palan, the French began to exchange fire with the Black Flags, who numbered around 1,200 and were supported by 3,000 Vietnamese. The Black Flags, armed with modern Winchester rifles, displayed the greatest courage, and only gave ground foot by foot. The Vietnamese, by contrast, held back. Although they made a lot of noise, yelling and waving their flags and beating their gongs and drums in a warlike manner, they showed little enthusiasm for actually fighting. Finally the French reached a pagoda at the base of the dyke. The Black Flags had evacuated the pagoda before the French arrived, and fallen back to the centre of their position, which lay behind the earth embankment of a dyke four hundred metres further on. The Black Flags had crowned this embankment with a bamboo fence, and seven large and conspicuous black flags, embroidered in silver, flew side by side at regular intervals along the fence. Behind the dyke Liu Yongfu had his headquarters in a small pagoda with a blue tiled roof. The Black Flags had placed their few artillery pieces along the left and centre of this line, so that their fire could sweep the dyke path that led to their defences. In this position the Black Flags were almost invisible. The French could only see their large bamboo straw hats. They were firing from cover, with admirable discipline and stubbornness. Casualties began to mount in the French ranks. Bou√´t attempted to beat down the enemy fire. Mousqueton, √âclair and Hache took up positions on the Day River behind the dyke, and fired into the unprotected rear of the Black Flag line. Roussel's battery deployed along the dyke, behind the pagoda, and also attempted to bombard the embankment, but with little effect. Most of the French shells had been soaked by the rain which had been falling strongly since the previous evening, and buried themselves without exploding in the soil of the embankment. French marine infantryman in Tonkin, 1883 Eventually Bou√´t ordered Berger to assault the enemy centre, and sent over Tacco√´n's company from Roux's battalion to reinforce the attack. Berger directed Gu√©rin de Fontjoyeux and Tacco√´n's marine infantry companies to lead the attack, supported by a company of Cochinchinese riflemen, while the other two companies of his battalion gave covering fire from the pagoda. The assault was made across a stretch of flooded rice paddy. The three attacking companies advanced across the 600-metre gap between the pagoda and the dyke in skirmish order through breast-high water, holding their rifles above their heads to keep them dry. The Black Flags soon distinguished the dark blue blouses of the marine infantry from the black jackets of the Cochinchinese riflemen, and concentrated their fire on the French troops.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 66 Tacco√´n's marine infantry company storms the dyke at Palan When the attacking wave was twenty metres from the dyke the bugles sounded the charge, and the two marine infantry companies stormed the embankment. Tacco√´n's company, leading the way, lost 5 men killed and 10 wounded in its approach. Gu√©rin de Fontjoyeux's men suffered almost as heavily, and two lieutenants were also killed during the assault. But the attack was so rapid that around fifty Black Flags, who had been lying on their backs asleep, did not have time to get to their feet, and were pinned to the ground with bayonet thrusts. The surviving Chinese fled across the rice paddies. The French killed many of them with rifle fire as they fled. While Berger was storming the centre of the Black Flag line around Phong, Roux attacked and routed the Vietnamese on the left, burning down the straw huts nestling in the middle of the bamboos. The attack was led by his own Cochinchinese riflemen and the Yellow Flags, with Drouin's marine infantry company deployed behind them to stiffen their resolve. The defenders gave way rather than face the ferocious Yellow Flags, and the attackers were able to take advantage of the collapse of Liu Yongfu's right wing to sweep in towards the centre, where they captured the seven Black Flag standards. As usual, the Black Flags carried off most of their dead, but sixty bodies were abandoned, along with several hundred rifles. Before the scandalised French could stop them, the jubilant Yellow Flags beheaded the corpses, stuck the heads on long bamboo poles, and planted them on the embankment of the dyke. French casualties in the Battle of Palan were 16 dead and 43 wounded, mostly in the two marine infantry battalions that had stormed the embankment. The Black Flags abandoned 60 bodies on the battlefield, and their total casualties were probably several hundred dead and wounded.Barbou, 304‚Äì23; Bastard, 197‚Äì205; Duboc, 180‚Äì91; Huard, 131‚Äì5; Lonlay, 88‚Äì92; Nicolas, 285‚Äì95; Sarrat, 81‚Äì94  Aftermath  The Yellow Flag auxiliaries plundered a peaceful Vietnamese village shortly after the battle, and Bou√´t was forced to disband them. Many of the discharged Yellow Flags promptly joined Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army at S∆°n T√¢y. Three months later they would be fighting against their former paymasters.  Significance  A panoramic view of the battle of Palan Although the battle was a clear tactical victory for the French, it brought little strategic gain. Liu Yongfu's Black Flags escaped to fight another day, and Liu Yongfu showed his disdain for the French by fortifying yet another defensive position a few kilometres back from the Day River. The French were no nearer to S∆°n T√¢y than they had been before the battle. Bou√´t was criticised for failing to win a victory of annihilation, and resigned shortly after the battle. Many of his officers regretted his departure, recognising that he had inflicted two defeats upon the Black Flags in difficult circumstances and had avenged the French defeat at the Battle of Paper Bridge in May 1883. But public opinion in France was anxious for a resolution of the Tonkin Campaign, and although the French now installed a post at Palan, enabling their gunboats to patrol the Red River as far as S∆°n T√¢y, this limited advance hardly satisfied Bou√´t's critics. More importantly, the battle hardened attitudes both in France and China, and hastened the slide into war. The French premier Jules Ferry substantially reinforced the Tonkin expeditionary corps, while the Chinese stepped up their covert support for the Black Flags in Tonkin.

History It is unclear when Eastern Christians first settled in Canada. Russian Orthodox missionaries from Alaska definitely traversed parts of present-day Canada (they reached Fort Ross, California in 1812), but they do not seem to have created any lasting missions. It is clear that by the 1890s Eastern Christian immigrants began arriving in Western Canada from Eastern Europe. In 1891, Ukrainian immigrants began to settle in Canada, and they were either Ukrainian Catholic (mostly from Galicia) or Eastern Orthodox (mostly from Bukovina a region under the Romanian Orthodox Church). Very few priests accompanied the settlers, however, \\"out of deference to the jurisdictional claims of the Russian Orthodox Church\\" over North America among the Orthodox, and because in 1894 the Catholic Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith issued a decree forbidding married priests in North America; consequently there are a shortage of Ukrainian priests in Canada. In 1896, a group of Russophile Ukrainians from Wostok, Northwest Territories wrote to the Russian Bishop of Alaska asking for a priest. In 1897, the first recorded Orthodox service was held in Canada at Wostok. Subsequently, Russian Orthodox priests were active in the Ukrainian community, and attracted many converts. The Greek Catholic church's few priests often clashed with Latin administrators such as Bishop Legal. An independent movement separate from the Catholic and Orthodox was founded in Winnipeg around 1903. This movement, backed by the Presbyterian Church, became the Seraphimite Church, and set up the Tin Can Cathedral in Winnipeg. After 1895, Romanians also began arriving in numbers to the Canadian West, and in 1902 St. Nicholas Romanian Orthodox Church was built in Regina, NWT; it remains standing as one of the oldest buildings in Regina and the oldest Romanian church in North America.http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/romanian_settlements.html By the turn of the 20th century, immigration from traditionally Eastern Christian countries included not only settlers moving to Western Canada looking for farmland but also those going to Eastern cities, primarily Toronto. The first Byzantine Rite church in that city was the Greek Orthodox Community of St. George, founded in 1909.Dr. Peter Jeffreys.

Cyril and Methody Macedono-Bulgarian Church, founded one year later in 1910 and the Russian Orthodox Church of Christ the Saviour in 1915. The coming of World War I dramatically affected the Eastern churches in Canada. The Russian Church lost the prestige of government support and in fact came under suspicion of being controlled by the Bolsheviks. Non-Russian ethnic groups set up their own churches in North America. In 1921, Serbian Orthodox parishes in the United States and Canada were reorganized into the Serbian Orthodox Diocese of America and Canada. The Russian church split into the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America, the Russian Orthodox Church in America, and some parishes who maintained links with Moscow. In June 1918, a group of disgruntled Ukrainian Catholic laypeople met to create the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Brotherhood, which became the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.

In other words, the matrix has the form : A=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! *&*&*&*&* \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,\\\\\\\\! *&*&0&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,\\\\\\\\! *&0&*&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,\\\\\\\\! *&0&0&*&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,\\\\\\\\! *&0&0&0&* \\\\end{bmatrix}. Any symmetric permutation of the arrowhead matrix, P^T A P, where P is a permutation matrix, is a (permuted) arrowhead matrix. Real symmetric arrowhead matrices are used in some algorithms for finding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Real symmetric arrowhead matrices Let A be a real symmetric (permuted) arrowhead matrix of the form : A=\\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cc} D & z \\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{T} & \\\\alpha \\\\end{array} \\\\right], where D=\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{diag}}(d_{1},d_{2},\\\\ldots ,d_{n-1}) is diagonal matrix of order n-1, z=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\zeta _{1} & \\\\zeta _{2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\zeta _{n-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}^T is a vector and \\\\alpha is a scalar. Let : A=V\\\\Lambda V^{T} be the eigenvalue decomposition of A, where \\\\Lambda =\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{diag}}(\\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2,\\\\ldots ,\\\\lambda_n) is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of A, and V=\\\\begin{bmatrix}v_{1} & \\\\cdots & v_{n} \\\\end{bmatrix} is an orthonormal matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors. The following holds: * If \\\\zeta_i=0 for some i, then the pair (d_i,e_i), where e_i is the i-th standard basis vector, is an eigenpair of A. Thus, all such rows and columns can be deleted, leaving the matrix with all \\\\zeta_i eq 0. * The Cauchy interlacing theorem implies that the sorted eigenvalues of A interlace the sorted elements d_i: if d_1 \\\\geq d_2\\\\geq \\\\cdots\\\\geq d_{n-1} (this can be attained by symmetric permutation of rows and columns without loss of generality), and if \\\\lambda_is are sorted accordingly, then \\\\lambda_1\\\\geq d_1\\\\geq \\\\lambda_2\\\\geq d_2\\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq \\\\lambda_{n-1} \\\\geq d_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\lambda_n . * If d_i=d_j, for some i eq j, the above inequality implies that d_{i} is an eigenvalue of A. The size of the problem can be reduced by annihilating \\\\zeta_j with a Givens rotation in the (i,j)-plane and proceeding as above. Symmetric arrowhead matrices arise in descriptions of radiationless transitions in isolated molecules and oscillators vibrationally coupled with a Fermi liquid. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors A symmetric arrowhead matrix is irreducible if \\\\zeta_i eq 0 for all i and d_{i} eq d_{j} for all i eq j. The eigenvalues of an irreducible real symmetric arrowhead matrix are the zeros of the secular equation : f(\\\\lambda )=\\\\alpha -\\\\lambda -\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\\\frac{\\\\zeta _{i}^{2}}{ d_{i}-\\\\lambda }\\\\equiv \\\\alpha -\\\\lambda -z^{T}(D-\\\\lambda I)^{-1}z=0 which can be, for example, computed by the bisection method. The corresponding eigenvectors are equal to : v_{i}=\\\\frac{x_{i}}{\\\\ x_{i}\\\\ _{2}}, \\\\quad x_{i}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left( D-\\\\lambda _{i}I\\\\right)^{-1}z \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\quad i=1,\\\\ldots ,n. Direct application of the above formula may yield eigenvectors which are not numerically sufficiently orthogonal. The forward stable algorithm which computes each eigenvalue and each component of the corresponding eigenvector to almost full accuracy is described in. The Julia version of the software is available.\\"Arrowhead.jl\\" Inverses Let A be an irreducible real symmetric arrowhead matrix.

He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987. He is not to be confused with his relative, also a priest, George Leo Haydock (1774‚Äì1849). Life He was the youngest son of Evan Haydock of Cottam Hall near Preston, Lancashire, and Helen, daughter of William Westby of Mowbreck Hall, Lancashire. After his wife died, Evan Haydock took up studies at the English College, Douai, and was ordained. He returned to England, where he worked for some years before becoming agent or procurator of the college. His sons Richard and George followed him to Douai. Richard became a doctor of divinity in Rome.Challoner, Richard. Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Thomas Richardson & son, 1843, p. 155 From Douai, George Haydock went to the Rome. He was ordained priest (apparently at Rheims), 21 December 1581.Wainewright, John. \\"Ven. George Haydock.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 25 March 2016 Cottam: St. Andrew's & Blessed George Haydock's Catholic Church. Built during the Recusant era in 1790 and still in operation. Haydock's name was added after his beatification in 1987. He arrived in England in mid-January 1582 and was arrested around 4 February while visiting an old acquaintance named Hawkinson. In the five years since they'd last met, Hawkinson, a former Catholic, had apostatised and having then encountered Haydock in London, informed the priest hunters Norton and Sledd. Haydock spent a year and three months in confinement in the Tower of London, suffering from a malarial fever he first contracted in the early summer of 1581 when visiting the seven churches of Rome. About May 1583, though he remained in the Tower, his imprisonment was relaxed to \\"free custody\\", and he was able to administer the Sacraments to his fellow-prisoners. During the first period of his captivity he was accustomed to decorate his cell with the name and arms of the Pope scratched or drawn in charcoal on the door or walls, and through his career he remained faithful to the spiritual authority of the Papacy. On 16 January 1584, he and other priests imprisoned in the Tower were examined at the Guildhall by the recorder, touching their beliefs. He frankly confessed, with reluctance, that he was eventually obliged to declare his treason in claiming that the queen was a heretic, and so seal his fate. Plaque honouring Blessed George Haydock in St. Andrew's & Blessed George Haydock's Catholic Church, Cottam, Lancashire, UK. On 5 February 1584, he was indicted with James Fenn, a Somersetshire man, formerly fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, William Deane who had been ordained priest the same day as himself, and six other priests, for having conspired against the queen at Rheims, 23 September 1581, agreeing to come to England, 1 October, and setting out for England, 1 November. In point of fact he arrived at Rheims on 1 November 1581. On the same 5 February two further indictments were brought, the one against Thomas Hemerford, a Dorsetshire man, sometime scholar of St John's College, Oxford, the other against John Munden, a Dorsetshire man, sometime fellow of New College, Oxford, John Nutter, a Lancashire man, sometime scholar of St John's College, Cambridge, and two other priests. The next day, St Dorothy's Day, Haydock, Fenn, Hemerford, Munden, and Nutter were brought to the bar and pleaded not guilty. Haydock had for a long time shown a great devotion to St Dorothy, and was accustomed to commit himself and his actions to her daily protection. It may be that he first entered the college at Douai on that day in 1574-5, but this is uncertain. The Concertatio Ecclesiae says he was arrested on this day in 1581-2, but the Tower bills state that he was committed to the Tower on the 5th, in which case he was arrested on the 4th. On Friday the 7th, all five were found guilty, and sentenced to death. The other four were committed in shackles to \\"the pit\\" in the Tower. Haydock, perhaps in case he should die by a natural death, was sent back to his old quarters. Thomas Hemerford Thomas Hemerford was born about 1553 in Dorsetshire, and studied at St John's College, Oxford. On 30 June 1575 he obtained a Bachelor of Civil Law degree from Hart Hall. In October 1580 he entered the English College at Rome. Hemerford is described as \\"a short man with a dark beard, severe of look but of a sweet disposition\\".Burton and Pollen, p.72 Ordained in Rheims in March 1583, he arrived in Hampshire in June. He was obliged to stay in a village while the blacksmith replaced a shoe on his horse, and a passerby denounced him as the priest who had preached in the barn. He was imprisoned at Winchester and then brought to the Marshalsea where he was indicted for conspiring with John Mundyn for the death of the Queen. From there he was committed to the Tower. Hemerford was tried and found guilty, despite a defective indictment, on 7 February 1584, and hanged, draw, and quartered at Tyburn on 12 February.Challoner, p. 167 John Mundyn John Mundyn or Munden was born in the Manor of Coltley in Dorset. He entered Winchester College in 1555 at the age of twelve, and the attended New College, Oxford, but was deprived for failing to communicate since the accession of Elizabeth. He then became for a time a schoolmaster in Dorset. In 1580 he left to study civil law at Douai, then at Rheims. In October 1581 he entered the English College in Rome. By June 1582 he was back at Rheims and left for the English Mission the following August.Burton and Pollen, p.95 In February 1583, while riding from Winchester to London, he happened on Hounslow Heath a magistrate from Dorset who recognised him. Mundyn was then arrested. Walsingham was so dissatisfied with Mundyn's answers when questioned that he gave the priest a blow to the face that affected Mundyn's hearing for several days.Burton and Pollen, p.98 Mundyn was remanded to the Broad Arrow Tower at the Tower of London. Mundyn was tried for conspiring against the Queen and condemned on 6 February 1584. James Fenn and Thomas Hemerford were beatified by Pope Pius XI in December 1929. Their feast day is 12 February.Bunson, Matthew et al., \\"Thomas Hemerford\\", Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints, OSV Publishing, 2003 Death Early on Wednesday the 12th the five priests were drawn to Tyburn on hurdles; Haydock, being probably the youngest and certainly the weakest in health, was the first to suffer.

He was the brother of the Roman Catholic priest and writer John Fenn and also had another brother named Robert Fenn. All three brothers were choristers and scholars. Before becoming a priest at around the age of 40, Fenn married and fathered a son and daughter and became a widower. He was executed for his loyalty to the Roman Catholic faith, which was contrary to the demand to recognize supremacy of the Church of England in preference to the Church of Rome. Life Born about 1540 in Montacute, Somersetshire, Fenn became a chorister in 1544 at the New College, Oxford, where his singing won him a place at Corpus Christi College. Although eligible for a Bachelor's degree in November 1558, he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy that would swear allegiance to the monarch Queen Elizabeth I as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. As insistence on the oath at that time would have affected the status of the majority of the Fellows and most of the Heads of Colleges, the requirement was temporarily suspended by the Privy council for candidates of degrees at the University of Oxford. Fenn took his degree on 22 November 1559, but he was expelled and his degree was revoked a year later in November 1560.Wainewright, John Bannerman. \\"Venerable James Fenn\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, (Edwin H. Burton and J. H. Pollen eds.), London. Longmans, Green and Co., 1914 He remained a while longer at the university and became a tutor to students at Gloucester Hall, but deciding that it was no longer safe for him there withdrew to Somersetshire.Challoner, Richard. Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Thomas Richardson & son, 1843, p. 161 There he became a tutor, married, and had children. While visiting his father in Wells, Bishop Gilbert Berkeley had him arrested for again refusing to take the oath, but released him when it was pointed out that there had been no occasion for exacting it. His father had given him the house in Montacute and he moved there with his family. The local vicar wanted him charged under the Act of Uniformity for not attending services. On advice of a relative, he went into hiding for two months, during which his wife died. Making provision for his children, he left the area and took a job as agent for Sir Nicholas Poynta of Gloucestershire. While there he met a priest, probably John Colleton, who suggested Fenn consider the priesthood. Fenn left for Rheims in 1579 and was ordained at Ch√¢lons in April 1580. He returned to Somersetshire the following month, where he worked unmolested for over a year. In July 1581, Edmund Campion and Father Colloton were arrested at Lyford Grange, along with some prominent people of Somersetshire. In the general excitement this caused, Fenn was arrested as a suspected recusant and eventually wound up at the Marshalsea. Given relative freedom, Fenn ministered to the other prisoners for about two years before he was recognized, possibly by the spy Thomas Dodwell.Fenn, Michael. \\"The Witness of Blessed James Fenn\\", Church of the Holy Ghost, Yeovil, June 18, 2014 On 7 February 1584, Fenn and George Haydock (whom Fenn had only met the day before in the dock) were tried and convicted of conspiracy and sedition, among other charges. Fenn was executed at Tyburn on 12 February 1584, along with George Haydock, John Munden, John Nutter and Thomas Hemerford. Noticing his daughter Frances in the crowd, he attempted to bless her as well as his pinioned hands would allow. His head was mounted on London Bridge and his quarters displayed above the four main gates of London. Beatification James Fenn was beatified on 15 December 1929 by Pope Pius XI.

He founded the Anjuman-i-Watan Baluchistan, which was allied with the Indian National Congress.  Early life  \\"I am told that I was born on July 7th, 1907 in the village Innayatullah Karez, Gulistan, district Quetta, and reside there till this day the July 2nd, 1959, while I write these lines in District Jail, Multan\\". Thus begins the autobiography of Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, Khan Shaheed as he is reverently known by his people. He lost his father early in life. He and his brother, Abdul Salam Khan were raised by the matriarch Dilbara. Achakzai received his early education at home, and was well versed in the classical Pashto, Arabic and Persian texts. He joined the local middle school and proved an outstanding student, earning a scholarship. \\"He completed his education, from middle to graduation, in prison and taught his illiterate jail mates. During his years in jail, he penned Tafseer and translated various books ‚Äì ‚ÄòThe future of freedom‚Äô into Urdu and Maulana Shibli Naumani's Seerat- un-Nabi into Pakhtu. Khan also authored a biography \\"Zama Jowand Aw Jowandun‚Äô (the way of my life) in three volumes\\".  Career  ‚ÄúThe struggle for independence, democracy and equal constitutional rights for his people resulted in his spending more than half of his adult life in various prisons of British India and Pakistan\\". Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai was imprisoned in May 1930 for the first time, as earlier he was warned by the rulers for his lectures to the villagers at the mosque. In his political struggle he founded Anjuman-i-Watan on 30 May 1938 (Khan Shaheed though remained in alliance against British colonialism in India, but never merged his led Anjuman-i-Watan in the Indian National Congress), which opposed the partition of India. In 1954, after the creation of Pakistan, he founded \\"Wror Pashtun\\" movement, later merged with the Pakistan's largest progressive alliance that became National Awami Party (NAP), as he was believer of the Pashtun unified geographical unit in Pakistan. Separated ways with the later after merging the Pashtun lands into Balochistan province that violated the NAP manifesto to form national units of Pashtun, Baloch, Sindhi, Siraiki, Bengali and Punjabis. ‚ÄúHe spent the last four years of his life (1969‚Äì1973), the longest spell in his political life out of prison, struggling for universal franchise, one-man one-vote in Balochistan and the tribal areas where only members of official Jirga were entitled to vote\\". Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai believed in equity, was staunch advocate of women rights, and challenged taboos for women voter registration for the general election in 1970. He was member of the Balochistan Provincial Assembly at the time of his assassination in December 1973. After Samad Khan's demise, his son Engineer Mahmood Khan Achakzai was elected the chairman of the party.  Literary life  Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai reformed the Bayazid Roshan Pashto script by excluding the Arabic alphabets that his fellow Pashtuns could not pronounce, and was the advocate to have a script of Pashto the way it is pronounced. Though, Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai had command over Arabic, Persian, English, Urdu, Balochi and Sindhi languages but loved his mother tongue Pashto the most and believed in its core importance in the nationalist struggle. He translated several books to Pashto, including, Tarjuman-ul-Quran of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Gulistan-i-Saadi of Sheikh Saadi and Future of Freedom of Dotson Carto, ‚ÄòSeerat-ul-Nabi of Shabli Numani. Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai succeeded in publishing the first ever newspaper in the province history ‚ÄúIstiqlal‚Äù from Quetta in 1938 after his 7 years hard struggle to get the Indian Press Act extended to the region. He was no doubt a pioneer journalist in the region.  The way I lived  Abdul Samad Khan began writing his memoirs in jail, covering the period of his birth in 1907 to serving sentence at district jail, Lahore in 1952. Originally written in Pashto, the memoirs entitled, ‚ÄòZama Zhwand aw Zhwandoon‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Way I Lived‚Äô unfurls to the birth of Khan Abdul Samad Khan quickly taking the reader to the patrilineal labyrinth of his ancestry. He introduces his great grandfather, Inayatullah Khan, son of Bostan Khan and finally Barkhurdar Khan the founding patriarch of his family. He writes: ‚ÄúOur ancestors since the time of Barkhurdar Khan remained connected to the national Afghan court and government and were apparently educated and well versed in the ways of courts and governance‚Ä¶. It is being related that Burkhurdar Khan was a contemporary of Ahmed Shah Baba (Durrani) the founder of present day Afghanistan.‚Äù ‚ÄúMore than his style of writing, Samad Khan‚Äôs unreserved thoughts on religion, jargas, drug addiction, pedophilia and other afflictions violating his beloved Pukthun and Pukhtun society force the reader to hasten to the next page‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn the year 1928 I got married. To get married was a thing to be done so did I. The truth however is that for many years I did not understand the profound and lasting value and meaning of marriage,‚Äù writes Khan Abdul Samad Khan. ‚ÄúHis memoirs are replete with similarly unexpected personal revelations, not ascribed usually to a Pukhtun‚Äù. Zama Zhwand aw Zhwandoon‚Äô (The way I lived) were transliterated into English by Samad Khan's son, Mohammad Khan Achakzai who also served as governor Balochistan from 2013 to 2018. It took Mohammad Khan Achakzai more than seven years to translate his father's opus written in haute Pashto into English. Later, the original Pashto edition was also translated into Ukrainian by high ranking diplomats, Mr Vasili Ivashko and Dr Ghulam Sarwar. Both of the versions, English and Ukrainian, will out of press by the end of November.

Currently President of the Tribunal de Grande Instance (Civil and Criminal Court) in √âvry, France, he was the first Registrar of the International Criminal Court, a post he held from 3 July 2003 to 9 April 2008. The Registry is responsible for the non-judicial aspects of the administration and servicing of the Court. As the first incumbent of the post of Registrar, Bruno Cathala set up a strategic plan making it possible to ensure the quality and fairness of justice at the ICC, the safety and security of victims and witnesses, the competence of Defence counsel ‚Äì in particular by establishing a list of counsel authorised to practice before the Court, public information and outreach, and the Court‚Äôs presence in the field through its field offices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, the Central African Republic and Chad. Biography = Education= An alumnus of the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais of Belgium, Bruno Cathala studied law in Paris. He earned a Ma√Ætrise de Droit (Law diploma) from the Universit√© de Paris XI in 1978, and a post-graduate Dipl√¥me d‚Äô√©tudes approfondies in civil law in 1980. He entered the √âcole Nationale de la Magistrature (National Magistracy School) in January 1981 (class of 1981 A). He then rounded out his training as a judge through continuous professional development, with a view, in particular, to understanding common law practices, through an internship with the Irish judicial authorities in 1986, and mediation, through an internship in Quebec in 1989, and within the context of a training course for officials of the Ministry of Justice. He also holds a diploma from the Institut des hautes √©tudes de la d√©fense nationale (IHEDN ‚Äì 51st national session ‚Äì 1998/1999) and from the Institut des hautes √©tudes de la s√©curit√© int√©rieure (IHESI ‚Äì 8th national session‚Äì 1996/1997). =Activities in France= Bruno Cathala began his judicial career as a judge in training in La Rochelle and went on to be a juvenile judge, first at the Tribunal de Grande Instance (Civil and Criminal Court) in Rouen and then in N√Æmes from 1981 to 1987. He was assigned to the √âcole Nationale de la Magistrature (National Magistracy School) from 1987‚Äì1990) to teach future judges how to be juvenile judges. It was during his tenure as President of the Tribunal de Grande Instance (Civil and Criminal Court) of Montargis from 1990 to 1994 that he became interested in court management and administration, and in the practical aspects of being a judge. His move to the Ministry of Justice as Associate Director of Protection Judiciaire de la Jeunesse (Judicial protection of youth) from 1994 to 1996 allowed him to acquire greater in-depth experience of managing a public administration and defining public policy in the field of child protection and juvenile delinquency. After a short spell in court as the Vice-President of the Tribunal de Grande Instance (Civil and Criminal Court) in Cr√©teil from 1996 to 1999 where he presided over the family and criminal chambers, he was appointed Inspector of Judicial Services, a post he held from 1999 to 2001. This position gave him the opportunity to participate, inter alia, in auditing the operations of courts and drafting a joint report with the Inspectorate of Social Affairs on provisional accommodation and placement of children and adolescents. This was in 2000. =Overseas activities= Prior to May 2001 Bruno Cathala did his military service from 1978‚Äì1979 in the area of military cooperation as a national service volunteer and was in charge of the academic cycle at the Ecole Nationale d‚ÄôAdministration in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire. This was his first contact with Africa. He subsequently participated in many missions abroad. First, in Asia. He made three trips to Phnom Penh, Cambodia ‚Äì the first after the Paris agreement and before the elections organised by the UN in 1993, during which time, he organised a training course for judges and shared his expertise in order to set up a training structure in Cambodia. He returned on two other occasions to continue the training and to accompany the Director of the √âcole Nationale de la Magistrature (National Magistracy School) who brought the project to fruition. He also travelled to Vientiane, Laos in 1992, also as part of a training programme for judges and prosecutors Later, in Eastern Europe, he took an active role in a training course on professional ethics for judges as part of training sessions organised in Varna in Bulgaria in July 2000, and in Sarajevo, Bosnia- Herzegovina in September 2000. That same year, he also took part in a Franco- Qu√©b√©cois seminar in Qu√©bec comparing judicial administration systems. Lastly, he travelled to Africa in 1991 for a symposium organised in Abidjan on the duties of judges and for a training course on professional conduct and ethics of judges in Madagascar in 1998. International courts After holding the post of Deputy Registrar of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia from 2001 to 2002, Bruno Cathala continued his international career at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague in the Netherlands. On 9 September 2002, he was appointed by the first session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Statute of the Court as Director of Common Services, thereby becoming the first official recruited by the organisation. Accordingly, he was called on, pursuant to decision ICC-ASP/1/Decision 2, \\"on an interim basis, [to] perform the functions and responsibilities of the Registrar\\" pending the Registrar‚Äôs taking up office. With the small group of staff members he recruited, in concert with the Host State and the President of the Assembly of States Parties, His Excellency Prince Zeid Ra‚Äôad Zeid Al- Hussein from Jordan, he went on to lay the foundations of the new organisation and to prepare the swearing-in ceremony of the judges who were elected in early 2003 and of the Prosecutor who was elected in April 2003. He was subsequently elected Registrar of the ICC for a term of five years by an absolute majority of the judges meeting in plenary session on 24 June 2003. He made the solemn declaration on 3 July that same year. During his term, he laid the foundations for the administration of the organisation, whose purpose, he recalled, was \\"to produce quality decisions throughout a fair trial\\", that is, from referral to the Prosecutor through to enforcement. As such, his main areas of focus were the respective requirements of defence counsel, counsel for victims and protected witnesses, and the need to ensure that the trial is made public, particularly in the interests of the victims of the crimes. Together with other registrars, he is one of the founding organisers of an annual meeting of registrars of international criminal courts, the first of which was held in Freetown, Sierra Leone in 2004. In 2008, Silvana Arbia succeeded Cathala as the Registrar of the ICC.

Trust works along with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) which is an elected body of city representatives (Corporation). NIT itself is not a democratically elected civic body and has members appointed in it from various levels like Government of Maharashtra, NMC and other representatives of Nagpur city. NIT thus has a small management body as compared to NMC. NIT holds the planning and development authority for Nagpur city but does not receive any funds from state government. Funds needed for development work are raised by NIT through the auction of newly developed areas. Overview NIT has played a major role in the expansion and maintaining Nagpur in its past 65+ years of work. However, the existence of NIT alongside NMC has been criticized several times as a violation of constitution of India. Several Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and former Governor of Maharashtra tried to abolish this agency but did not succeed. The Argument is that the Constitution of India allows only democratically elected bodies to carry out the work of civic administration. Since NIT is not such a body, it has been demanded by several political bodies to abolish the NIT Act of 1936 or to merge NIT with NMC. It has been claimed that due to political reasons state government has failed to take any action till now. However, there are similar organizations like the Mumbai Metropolitan and Area Development Authority (MMRDA), Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and several such agencies that are functioning in the country today and the argument of NIT not fulfilling Constitutional Requirements has not been substantiated in the Courts of Law. NIT has also faced criticism from those farmers which had to hand over their lands as per NIT directives and Urban land ceiling act. History Nagpur is an important city in central India and during days of British Raj two separate committees were formed to look after city's development. The Nagpur Municipal Committee was established in 1864. The Civil Station Sub-Committee was established in 1884. In 1928, the Municipal Committee passed a resolution for creating an \\"Improvement Trust\\" for Nagpur which was established in 1937 under the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936. NIT began functioning in 1937 and has collateral jurisdiction over the areas within the limits of the town wherever schemes are prepared by the trust and approved by the government. After Indian independence, the Town Planning Department was established in 1947 under Central Provinces and Berar State Town Planning Expert with head office at Nagpur. The Department functioned under the administrative control of the local Self-Government Department. The Central Provinces and Berar Town Planning Act was enacted in 1948 and the Central Provinces and Berar Regulation of Uses of Land Act was also enacted in the same year to provide for the making and execution of town planning schemes and to regulate the development of areas with the object of securing proper sanitary conditions, amenities and convenience to persons living in such areas and in neighboring areas. Later with creation of Maharashtra, Nagpur became part of Maharashtra state. A new branch office of this department came into existence at Nagpur for the four districts of Nagpur, Chandrapur, Wardha and Bhandara. Nagpur department continued to function along with NMC.  Organization  NIT board members include - # A Chairman, who is a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer (currently Dr.Deepak Mhaisekar ) # Commissioner of Nagpur Municipal Corporation. # Deputy Director of Town Planning for Nagpur Division. # Chairman of Standing Committee. # One Corporation elected by NMC. # A member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly who is a resident of Nagpur City. # Three members appointed by the State Government of Maharashtra.  Work  Nagpur Improvement Trust has played a major role in transforming Nagpur into a mega city. Its major responsibilities include - housing schemes, rebuilding of certain city pockets, maintaining city streets, drainage and sanitation and city improvement schemes. NIT act of 1936, allows NIT to acquire land from surrounding rural areas to develop into new urban layouts. Money needed to acquire these lands and develop them is recovered back by the auction to general public when they are ready. Once a new area of the city is developed by NIT it is handed back to NMC for maintenance. NMC then recovers the money in form of various taxes from the residents of which two percent is given back to NIT. NIT in turns has the responsibility to provide drinking water and sewage disposal for these areas. NIT also distributes significant land acquired to weaker sections of the society at considerably lower rates. NIT also undertakes the work of regularization of unauthorized residential zones. NIT is also responsible for maintaining the 8 major gardens and 40 mini gardens in Nagpur. Various lakes and city monuments that come under the jurisdiction of local bodies are maintained by NIT. It has recently started a project to rejuvenate the Futala Lake in city. NIT is also working on rejuvenating the Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur on a Build-Operate-Transfer basis. In 2007, NIT unveiled the plans for setting up the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority(NMRDA). NIT was given the status of development authority by the state government and it has identified a total area of 3780 km2 for the Greater Nagpur Metropolitan Area excluding the area under NMC limits. The first phase of this Nagpur Metropolitan Region is to cover 1, 520 km2 of area. NIT is also planning to build a monorail in Nagpur. Maharashtra Airport Development Company ( MADC ) which is currently building MIHAN in Nagpur has also shown keen interest in the project.

Much of the impetus came from problems in using JAL: labor unions were unwilling to put aircrews at risk in missions to evacuate Japanese citizens from overseas, and often objected to transporting members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces overseas for political reasons. The privatization of JAL in the mid-1980s hastened the process. The Cabinet of Japan decided to purchase two Boeing 747-400 aircraft in 1987 in order to have aircraft with worldwide operating range. Another goal of the 36 billion yen purchase was to counterbalance the growing trade deficit between Japan and the US. Both aircraft were delivered in the fall of 1991 (though one source has the second delivery as being in April 199220-1101 Japan Air Self- Defence Force (JASDF) Boeing 747-47C (Planespotters.net)). Kiichi Miyazawa was the first prime minister to use the 747 when he visited the US in 1993; the Emperor used the aircraft for the first time later that year. German chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der joined Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi aboard the aircraft in 2002 in order to attend the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals in Yokohama, to which Germany advanced while Schr√∂der was attending a G8 summit in Canada. The operation, hastily improvised due to difficulties in flying the German government's Airbus A310 aircraft from Canada to Japan, was called \\"hitchhiking diplomacy\\" in the Japanese media. This was the first time a foreign head of government had flown on the aircraft.http://www.weblio.jp/content/ÊîøÂ∫úÂ∞ÇÁî®Ê©ü The aircraft were used to transport relief workers to the area of the 2010 Canterbury earthquake in New Zealand. Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara offered use of the aircraft to evacuate Japanese nationals on the return flight, but was forced to withdraw this offer when the foreign ministry pointed out that there was not enough space for all of them on board.ÊîøÂ∫úÂ∞ÇÁî®Ê©ü„Å´Ë¢´ÁÅΩËÄÖÂÆ∂Êóè‰πó„Çå„Åö„ÄåÂ∏åÊúõÂãü„Å£„Å¶„Åä„Åç„Å™„Åå„Çâ„Äç, Asahi Shimbun, Feb 24, 2011 In January 2011, Prime Minister Naoto Kan was criticized for using the aircraft for a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos while 500 Japanese nationals were stranded in the midst of civil unrest in Cairo. The Weekly Asahi tabloid newspaper stated that the Foreign Ministry had requested use of the aircraft for evacuation purposes but that Kan had rejected the request citing the priority of the Davos mission. Kan denied that such a discussion had taken place, and the Foreign Ministry stated that the aircraft was not used because of the difficulty of getting landing and transit permits from various governments on short notice.http://www.j-cast.com/2011/02/25089076.html Kan later considered using the aircraft for a trip to Germany to watch the Japanese team play in the finals of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, but advisors dissuaded him from doing so due to the high cost and possibility of public outcry in the wake of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.ÂëÜ„Çå„ÅüËèÖ„ÅÆ„Äå„Å™„Åß„Åó„ÅìË¶≥Êà¶„ÄçË®àÁîª‚Ä¶ÊîøÂ∫úÂ∞ÇÁî®Ê©ü„ÅßÂºæ‰∏∏„ÉÑ„Ç¢„Éº , ZAKZAK, Jul 16, 2011. The Democratic Party of Japan government requested public comments about the Japanese government budget in 2011, and many responses criticized the aircraft as wasteful, suggesting that the government should switch back to charters of private aircraft as required; however, following a hostage crisis in Algeria in 2013, the Shinzo Abe government determined that the aircraft should be maintained for national security purposes. As of August 2013, the aircraft had completed 269 missions. Layout Boeing 747 Japan Air Self-Defense Force seal mounted inside the L-1 door The aircraft are painted with red and gold stripes along the fuselage and red sun insignia on the tail and wings. The aircraft contains an office area in the front-most section of the lower level, ordinarily for use by the Prime Minister, which may be repurposed for use by the Imperial family or other VIPs. The next cabin toward the front has lie-flat seating for senior officials (2-3-2 configuration), a separate enclosed VIP cabin with two seats, a conference table with seats that fold down into beds, and a secretarial area with office equipment. The main cabin normally functions as a seating area for reporters, with seating equivalent to airline short-haul business class seating (also 2-3-2 configuration), and has a table at the front to be used for press conferences. These cabins may be used as passenger seating on evacuation missions. The upper deck has seating equivalent to airline economy class seating (3-3 and 2-3 configuration), which is used for communications and crew rest.http://www.fushou-miyajima.com/gekisya/080523_02.html Operation JASDF Boeing 747-400 landing at Santiago de Compostela Airport Although the aircraft were initially operated by the Prime Minister's Office as civil aircraft, they were transferred to Japan Defense Agency control in April 1992 and re- registered as defense aircraft. They are currently operated by the of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, and are based at Chitose Air Base in Hokkaido. Each aircraft operates with a standard crew complement of 17 to 19 personnel, consisting of two to four pilots, three communications operators and twelve flight attendants. For shorter VIP flights, the government also uses Eurocopter EC225 helicopters (GSDF 1st Helicopter Brigade) and Gulfstream IV business jets (ASDF, known as U-4 in Japanese defense parlance). The Gulfstream IV was only used as a prime ministerial aircraft once, by Yasuo Fukuda to travel from Beijing to Nagasaki at short notice when the 747 was unavailable. Unlike the American Air Force One, the Japanese government aircraft may only be used for government business, and cannot normally be used for personal travel by the Imperial family or the Prime Minister. During emergency evacuations of Japanese citizens from particularly dangerous areas overseas, personnel from the Guide Unit of the 1st Airborne Brigade, along with officials from the MOFA will travel on the aircraft, in order to assist with the retrieval and transport of evacuees to evacuation points. Japan Airlines provided ground support services for the aircraft until December 2010, shortly prior to JAL's retirement of its 747 fleet. Since December 2010, these services have been provided by Nippon Cargo Airlines. In July 2019, both aircraft were sold to American company CSDS Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of CSDS Aircraft Sales & Leasing Inc, based in Rolling Hills Estates, California. 20-1102 became N7477C and 20-1101 is slated to become N7474C. Both aircraft are being considered for Cargo conversion by Bedek/ IAI. Second generation Japanese Air Force One parked (Boeing 777) in 2018 While the Boeing 787 was reportedly a leading candidate to replace the 747s at one point due to its fuel efficiency and its large proportion of Japanese components, and the Airbus A350 was also raised as a candidate by some officials, the Ministry of Defense favored the 777 due to its capabilities being closer to those of the 747. The aircraft were replaced by Boeing 777-300ER aircraft in the fiscal year 2019, with maintenance outsourced to All Nippon Airways. The first 777-300ER arrived at Chitose Air Base to commence testing and training on August 17, 2018, while the second is scheduled to arrive in December 2018. The Boeing 747-400 were taken out of service, stored at Sapporo for a period of time, then ferried to Marana for short term storage under new registrations N7474C and N7477C. It is currently being planned to convert the two aircraft to carry cargo.

It is in charge of enhancing the employability of offenders and preparing them for their reintegration into the national workforce. Their services include training, work, employment assistance for offenders and community engagement.  History  SCORE's origins date back to 7 November 1975, when it was established under the provisions of the SCORE Act, as a statutory board to bring about the rehabilitation of offenders. It took over the functions of the prison industries, which were then operating traditional services like book-binding, woodwork, cane work, tailoring and footwear manufacturing.  Activities  SCORE provides on-the-job training to offenders in market-relevant commercial services such as laundry and linen leasing, central kitchen, bakery, food catering, subcontracting, industrial space leasing and digital media. Revenue generated from these services goes back to funding rehabilitation programmes for offenders such as training and employment assistance. It offers nationally accredited training to offenders. Apart from purely vocational training, SCORE has now included employability skills, such as IT and job readiness preparation training. It also makes use of an online job portal to facilitate the job matching of offenders with potential employers in its job bank. In 2018, SCORE will provide job profiling for inmates for more effective assessment and coaching. Job retention support increase from 6 to 12 months. Advanced Training provided under the Workforce Skills Qualifications under Culinary Skills framework. SCORE is part of the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-offenders (CARE) network, which spearheaded the Yellow Ribbon Project in 2004 to raise awareness on the reintegration needs of ex- offenders and their families.

The party was formed in 1988, and dissolved in 1996. It was formed by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah's \\"Team B\\" faction of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), as a challenge to prime minister Mahathir Mohamad and UMNO. Razaleigh had the personal support of former UMNO prime ministers Tunku Abdul Rahman and Hussein Onn, both of whom had also fallen out with Mahathir. Establishment The idea of Semangat 46 first came about in 1985 or 1986 when Malaysia was experiencing an economic recession. In 1987, Razaleigh's \\"Team B\\" faction challenged Mahathir's \\"Team A\\" faction for control of UMNO. Mahathir won the party election with a slim 41 votes majority,Yahaya(2003), p. 135 and removed all Team B members from the cabinet. Team B leaders claimed many party delegates were improperly elected, and filed suit to overturn the election. This led to UMNO being declared illegal on technical grounds in 1988. Mahathir immediately reconstituted UMNO, with only Team A members.Rodan (1996), p. 138 Razaleigh and Team B formed their own party. They tried to register as \\"UMNO 46\\" (alluding to the party's founding in 1946. This was an attempt to invoke the nostalgic spirit of the old UMNO. \\"UMNO 46\\" was rejected as a duplicate name, so Razaleigh chose the name \\"Semangat 46\\".Tan (1989), p. 38-40 On 3 June 1989, Semangat 46 was officially registered with the electoral college.Hwang (2003), p. 182 The first party's general meeting was held on 12 October 1989, officiated by Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al- Haj.http://theindiestory.blogspot.com/2008/05/parti-melayu- semangat-46-penghormatan.html Among notable leaders that joined Semangat 46 were Marina Yusoff, Ilyani Ishak, Harun bin Idris, Suhaimi Kamaruddin, Ahmad Shabery Cheek, Othman Saat, Salleh Abas, Mohd Radzi Sheikh Ahmad, Tengku Azlan Sultan Abu Bakar, and Ibrahim Ali. General election In 1990, Semangat 46 formed two coalitions with other opposition parties to contest the 1990 Malaysian general election. The Gagasan Rakyat (GR) coalition was with the multi-racial Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Parti Rakyat Malaysia (PRM). The Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah (APU) coalition was with the Muslim parties Pan- Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), Pan-Malaysian Islamic Front (BERJASA), Parti Hizbul Muslimin Malaysia (HAMIM) and the newly formed Malaysian Indian Muslim Congress (KIMMA).Hwang (2003), p. 184 Despite these alliances, Semangat 46 did poorly in the 1990 federal election, winning only 8 of 180 seats. However, the Angkatan alliance swept the state election in Razaleigh's home state, Kelantan, winning all 39 seats. Semangat 46 won 15, PAS won 24.Francis Kok et al. (2002), p. 95 For the first time in UMNO history, the party failed to win any seats in a state level.Yahaya (2003), p. 5 Over the next few years, Semangat 46 lost support; many of its members defected to UMNO, including the party's youth chief Ibrahim Ali. Others remained as members but withdrew from political activity. In February 1994, Semangat 46 decided to challenge UMNO on Malay communal issues. The party was renamed Parti Melayu Semangat 46, and thus renounced its multi-ethnic stance. In the mid-1990s, Semangat 46's relationship with DAP deteriorated, which eventually led to the breakup of the Gagasan Rakyat coalition, shortly before the 1995 Malaysian general election. At the same time, Semangat 46 had increasingly strained ties with PAS over power-sharing in Kelantan state, though they still managed to retain control of Kelantan and worked together in the 1995 election. By this time, the party's credibility was severely compromised by winning so few electoral victories and the loss of many key figures. The deputy president, Rais Yatim, lost his parliamentary seat in the 1995 election, though Tengku Razaleigh was re-elected. In the end, Semangat 46 won six parliamentary seats, with support coming mainly from Kelantan.Hwang (2003), p. 260-1 Dissolution By May 1996, Semangat 46 was greatly reduced in size and influence. Razeleigh was finally worn out after spending millions of ringgit to upkeep the party. Razaleigh officially announced to the remaining 200,000 members that he would disband the party, which was done in October. Razaleigh rejoined UMNO with most of the party members.

Background Taumata was born in Wellington, New Zealand to MƒÅori parents. He has four brothers and three sisters. Playing career Originally from Wellington, Taumata of MƒÅori descent was brought to Australia as a 15-year-old to join the Brisbane Broncos. He was sacked by the Broncos for disciplinary breaches and also spent time at the Sydney Roosters before making his first grade debut with the Bulldogs in Round 16 2008, against his former club the Roosters.Bad boy Taumata taking steps to redemption stuff.co.nz, 19 June 2012 In January 2009, Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy announced his plan to promote Taumata to a playmaking role with the Storm. In early February however, Taumata was dismissed by the Storm after a \\"physical altercation\\" off-field, his fourth dismissal in four years. It was stated that the NRL was unlikely to register a contract for Taumata for the 2009 season, even if he found another club. Taumata signed with the Wests Tigers for the 2010 season. In June 2010, Taumata was released mid-season from his contract with the Wests Tigers after spending most of the year in the New South Wales Cup, to sign with the North Queensland Cowboys. He made his debut for the Cowboys that weekend, coming off the bench in their 20-19 loss to the Cronulla Sharks. It was his first NRL game in almost 2 years. In October 2010 he played for the New Zealand MƒÅori in their 18-18 draw with England prior to the 2010 Four Nations tournament. After being released by the Cowboys at the end of the 2010 season, Taumata signed by the Penrith Panthers on a one-year deal for 2011. He played for the Panthers feeder club, the Windsor Wolves, in the NSW Cup. In June 2011 he was involved in a police investigation into prescription fraud. After the police investigations, Taumata was found guilty of stealing a prescription pad from the Panthers club doctor, and using it to attempt to buy Valium. As a result, Taumata had to comply with an 18-month good behaviour bond. However Panthers General Manager Phil Gould offered Taumata a lifeline in the off-season and signed Taumata for another year, stating that it was his final chance to stake a claim for a first-grade jumper, with the condition that he undergo intensive counselling and labouring work. After a stint in the Penrith Panthers feeder club, the Windsor Wolves in 2012, with the team reaching second on the NSW Cup ladder, Taumata played his first rugby league game at the top grade level in almost two years, on 17 June 2012, for the Penrith Panthers against the Gold Coast Titans. Taumata scored a try in the 59th minute of the Round 15 game - his first try at the top grade level for the Panthers. This was also Taumata's debut appearance for the club at first grade level. In 2013, Taumata said that he left the Panthers and was not playing rugby league. He said had received, \\"no support from the club... I felt let down in many ways.\\" Phil Gould said of Taumata's period with the Panthers, \\"At the time I feared he would kill himself or kill someone else the way he was living his life. That's why I stepped in to get him the help he needed. Thankfully I think those days are now well behind him. I have not heard from Arana for some time.\\" Taumata played for the Newtown Jets in 2014 before moving to Tumut in 2015. Taumata was removed as Captain Coach of Tumut after round 10 of the group 9 season for disciplinary reasons. Taumata had broken the clubs '3 strike policy' and was told his services were no longer required. Taumata was mentioned in July 2017 to be playing with Moore Park Broncos in a local Sydney A-Grade competition, in an article comparing State Of Origin players to local competitors. In 2018, Taumata joined Intrust Super Premiership NSW side the Wentworthville Magpies.

Social networking is one of the most active web-based activities in the Philippines, with Filipinos being declared as the most active users on a number of web-based social network sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. The use of social networking website has become so extensive in the Philippines that the country has been tagged as \\"The Social Networking Capital of the World,\\" and has also become part of Filipino cyberculture. Social networking is also used in the Philippines as a form of election campaign material, as well as tools to aid criminal investigation. History Friendster is one of the first social networking websites in the World Wide Web when it was introduced in 2002. However, its popularity in the United States plummeted quickly in 2004 due to massive technical problems and server delays. But as it was losing its American audience, Friendster slowly gained users from Southeast Asia starting in the Philippines. Friendster director of engineering Chris Lunt wondered why its web traffic was spiking in the middle of the night, and noticed that the traffic was coming from the Philippines. He then traced the trail to a Filipino-American marketing consultant and hypnotist named Carmen Leilani de Jesus as the first user to have introduced Friendster to the Philippines, where a number of her friends live. Statistics A study released by Universal McCann entitled \\"Power To The People - Wave3\\" declared the Philippines as \\"the social networking capital of the world,\\" with 83 percent of Filipinos surveyed are members of a social network. They are also regarded as the top photo uploaders and web video viewers, while they are second when it comes to the number of blog readers and video uploaders. With over 7.9 million Filipinos using the Internet, 6.9 million of them visit a social networking site at least once a month. At times, Friendster has been the most visited website in the Philippines, as well as in Indonesia, according to web tracking site Alexa. David Jones, vice president for global marketing of Friendster, said that \\"the biggest percentage of (their site's) users is from the Philippines, clocking in with 39 percent of the site's traffic.\\" He further added that in March 2008 alone, Friendster recorded 39 million unique visitors, with 13.2 million of whom were from the Philippines. Meanwhile, Multiply president and founder Peter Pezaris said that the Filipino users of their site comprised the largest and most active group in terms of number of subscribers and of photographs being uploaded daily. About 2.2 million out of more than nine million registered users of Multiply are Filipinos, outnumbering even nationalities with a bigger population base like the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil. Also, one million photographs are uploaded by Filipinos to Multiply every day, which is half of their total number worldwide. Sixty percent of Filipino users of Multiply are female, while 70 percent are under the age of 25. In comparison, Filipino Friendster users are between the ages 16 to 30, with 55 percent of them female. Application in Filipino culture and society The popularity of social networking in the Philippines can be traced in the Filipinos' culture of \\"friends helping friends.\\" For Filipinos, their friends and who they know can become more valuable than money, especially when what they need can be achieved through nepotism, favoritism, and friendship among others. Social networking has extensive uses in the Philippines. It was used to promote television programs like Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus with its two profiles on Multiply. A call center company posted job openings on its Multiply community site and was able to attract recruits. The power of social networking was tested in the country's 2007 general elections when senatorial candidate Francis Escudero created his own Friendster profile to bolster support from Filipino users. He eventually won a seat in the Senate. Local celebrities and politicians have since created their own profiles on Friendster as their medium to communicate with their fans and constituents. Friendster was also used as a tool for police investigations. Local police in Cebu City were able to track down the suspects for the robbery and murder of a female nursing student in March 2008. After receiving information and tips from the public and other police operatives, the local police searched through the suspects' profiles in order to get a closer look at their faces. The police printed the pictures of the suspects and launched a series of police operations, which led to their arrest. Meanwhile, Manila Police District arrested a suspect for the murder of two guest relations officers in Tondo in January 2007 after they were able to find the suspect's whereabouts through his Friendster profile. Social networks also became a source of high-profile cyberwars, notably between actors Ynez Veneracion and Mon Confiado against Juliana Palermo. The two accused Palermo of creating a fake Friendster profile of her ex-boyfriend Confiado, which is uploaded with photos of Confiado and his girlfriend Veneracion but laden with profanities in each caption. For his bid for the Philippine Presidency in May 2010, then Secretary of National Defense, Gilberto Teodoro launched an aggressive campaign via the social media. He capitalized on networks such as YouTube and Facebook. He reportedly spent nearly a quarter of his campaign budget on the social media in the Philippines; in comparison to the 15th Philippine president's Benigno Simeon Aquino III ‚Äì 9%. Criticism Filipino- American Internet personality Christine Gambito, also known as HappySlip, criticized Friendster for displaying what she described as \\"inappropriate advertisements\\" that appear on her profile. She posted a message on the site's bulletin board addressing her fans that she contemplated deleting her account. Gambito had earlier deleted her MySpace account because she objected to the Google-powered online advertisements that she said \\"were in direct conflict with the HappySlip brand and especially misrepresentative of Filipino women.\\" She particularly criticized the posting of advertisements of international dating websites that supposedly target Filipinas. Meanwhile, Philippine National Police Director General Avelino Razon ordered the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group to find out who created a fake account on Friendster using his identity. The profile was laden with false information about him, saying that he \\"wants to meet traitors, corrupts, criminals so he could crush them.\\" As of December 2008, there have been cases of spam comments in Friendster profiles, most of which are in the form of a JPEG image masquerading as an embedded YouTube video, with a thumbnail of a sexually explicit video clip, such as a girl undressing herself or something similar. Clicking on the image usually results in a redirect to a dubious or disreputable website, or worse, a drive-by download of malware, such as the Koobface worm. Because some of the users, especially teenagers, who usually log on to the site in an Internet cafe, have only limited knowledge about malware and/or computers in general, such social engineering attacks can be a significant risk. The site had received considerable criticism due to this issue.How to stop Friendster spamYouTube Virus?

Hartley was sent to Marshalsea Prison, London. Here he was detected saying Mass in a cell before Lord Vaux, and for this he was laid in irons on 5 December 1583. He was indicted for conspiracy, despite the fact that he had already been imprisoned in the Marshalsea at the time the alleged conspiracy took place.Dunn, Henry E., \\"Venerable William Hartley\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, (Edwin Hubert Burton and John Hungerford Pollen, eds.) Longmans, Green and Co., 1914, 522. In January 1585, he was sent into exile and put on board a ship at Tower Wharf bound for Normandy. He then spent some little time at Reims, recovering his health, and made a pilgrimage to Rome on 15 April 1586, before returning to the English mission. In September 1588, he was arrested in Holborn, London, and, as his friend Father Warford said, incurred the suspicion of having apostatized.Hungerford Pollen, 1891, page 272 In the aftermath of the Armada, Hartley was executed at Shoreditch on 5 October 1588. Companions Less is known of Hartley's companions. *John Hewitt was son of a draper at York and a student at Caius College, Cambridge. He had once been in York prison, but was arrested in Grey's Inn Lane, London, 10 March 1857, going under the name of Weldon, and died under that name; this had led several early martyrologists into the mistake of making him into two martyrs, Hewett dying at York, and Weldon at London. *Robert Sutton was a tutor or schoolmaster, born at Kegworth in Leicestershire, who had practiced his profession in Paternoster Row, London. Sometime prior to June 1586, he met there a Mr. Blythe (aka Oliver Heywoode), an old priest working in the area of Newgate, and converted to Catholicism. He was soon arrested and incarcerated. He was executed at Clerkenwell 5 October 1588.\\"Venerable Robert Sutton\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, (Edwin Hubert Burton and John Hungerford Pollen, eds.) Longmans, Green and Co., 1914, 531. *John Harrison, alias Symons, had carried letters from one priest to another. As he had before \\"been slandered to be a spy\\", his fame suffered some obscurity. It is also hardly doubtful that his name, Harrison, was confounded with that of either Matthias or James Harrison, priests, who suffered martyrdom in 1599 or 1602 respectively. This perhaps explains why his name has fallen out of the process of the English martyrs, and in its place was inserted that of Richard Williams, a \\"Queen Mary priest\\" who really suffered four years later. John Robinson John Robinson was born in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He married and had a son named Francis, born in 1569. Upon the death of his wife, he entered the English College at Rheims. He returned to England briefly in mid-August 1584 to visit his son, who was the fifteen. The following April, Harrison was ordained and went on the English mission in June. Upon arriving, he immediately took ship for the North. His ship, likely bound for Newcastle, put in at Yarmouth Roads, where he was arrested and sent to The Clink, where he remained for three years. The persecution that broke out after the failure of the Armada brought him to the scaffold. The place set for his execution was Ipswich; Harrison chose to walk. He was hanged, drawn, and quartered on 1 October 1588. His son was ordained five years later.Clayton, James. \\"Venerable John Harrison\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, (Edwin Hubert Burton and John Hungerford Pollen, eds.)

They most often occur as pairs of devilish characters who exert their perfidious influence on the main character of the drama.W.M.H. Hummelman (1958). \\"De sinnekens in het rederijkersdrama.\\" Groningen. The word sinnekin comes from the Dutch word sinneken which, by 1604, connoted the words \\"senses\\" or \\"meanings\\". The word's alternative meaning, drawn from sixteenth- century Dutch rederijker drama, was \\"a symbolic or allegorical person in a spel van sinne,\\"Middelnederlandsch Handwordenboek, vII, 1158. an allegorically fashioned dramatic exposition of an argument on an ethical, ideological, political, or religious issue. Like the fool with his bauble, the sinneken functioned as had the Devil in earlier medieval drama; by their costumes, actions, and words these characters usually supplied examples of foolish behavior.On the function and role of the sinneken, see the summary in J. J. Mak, De rederijkers (Patria vaderlandsche cultuurgeschiedenis in monografieen, xxxiv), Amsterdam, 1944, 58-78; and esp. W. M. H. Hummelen, De sinnekens in het rederijkersdrama, Groningen, 1958. Sinnekins, then, are allegorical characters who, in some way, instruct the audience on folly through their temptation of the main character. Indeed, sinnekens often argued for rational behavior (i.e. the repentance and salvation of the audience) while acting in just the opposite manner (i.e. foolishly).

The line had been opened in 1839 by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway from Derby, to a south-facing junction with the London and Birmingham Railway just north of Hampton-in-Arden. Due to increasing traffic, and the inconvenience of having to reverse trains at Hampton-in-Arden to reach Birmingham Curzon Street, a branch was built in 1842 west from Whitacre to a new Midland Railway passenger station at Birmingham Lawley Street. The Midland Railway generally used the London and North-Western Railway Trent Valley Line and Great Northern Railway tracks to reach London, so the line south to Hampton faded into obscurity. In 1864, the Midland built a new line eastwards to Nuneaton.
