The culture was bordered to its northeast by the Elp culture, to which it may have been related, and to its north by the Hoogkarspel culture.

An urn found there, initially classified as being of the Deverel‚ÄìRimbury type, was found to be older than was expected: radiocarbon dating pointed to 3450 BP (1770 +/-250 cal BC).

The SAFOS is second in prestige to the President's Scholarship. 292 of such scholarships have been awarded as of the year 2013. SAFOS scholars are groomed for the highest levels of command and management in the SAF and beyond. They generally do another post-graduate degree in Master of Business Administration or Master in Public Policy overseas in the middle of their careers to prepare themselves for appointments beyond the Singapore Armed Forces. Upon graduation, SAFOS scholars go through different tour of duty from other cadet officers. Selection The scholarship is awarded to outstanding officer cadets with excellent A level/IB results, impressive co-curricular activities and outstanding performance in Officer Cadet School. Candidates must also graduate from Basic Military Training (BMT) with an acceptable leadership score and excel in their individual fitness test (IPPT). After they are selected through rigorous rounds of interviews, scholars must complete and pass the 9-month Officer Cadet Course and receive their commission, before leaving for undergraduate studies. Medical/Dentistry candidates will disrupt from their cadet course for studies before returning for a 3-month Medical Officer Cadet Course (MOCC). Upon graduation, they return to serve in the Singapore Armed Forces. Their overseas studies typically takes place in the United Kingdom or United States. Popular choices amongst scholars include universities such as Imperial College London, Cambridge University, Oxford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Princeton University, University of Chicago, and University of California, Berkeley. Career prospects Graduates receive their promotion to the rank of Captain (CPT) after a year of returning to service, thereafter serve 2-year command/instructor/staff tours, typically reaching the rank of Lieutenant- Colonel (LTC) and receive their battalion command by their 12-year of service. The rapid promotion and high salaries is to maintain competitiveness for the best minds in a highly educated society. Most scholars will achieve post- graduate qualifications in Public Administration or Engineering from Ivy- League or top British Universities. It is also common for these scholars to be headhunted to join the private sector or inducted into political service.

The species is known only from the Early Eocene, Ypresian stage Oise amber from the Quesnoy locality, Oise Department, France. History and classification Ordralfabetix sirophatanis is known only from one fossil, the holotype, number \\"PA. 2378\\". It is a single partial adult preserved as an impression on the surface of a clear orange amber specimen. The fossil was recovered from an outcrop of Oise amber which was discovered in 1997 at Quesnoy, near the Oise River in Northern France. The type specimen is currently preserved in the entomology department of the French Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. Ordralfabetix was first studied by Jacek Szwedo of the Mus√©um with his 2011 type description for the genus and species being published in the journal Zootaxa. The generic name was coined by Szwedo in reference to The Adventures of Asterix character Ordralfabetix, the village fishmonger. The etymology of the specific epithet sirophatanis is a combination of two proto-Celtic word cores, \\"siro\\" which translates to \\"long\\" and \\"phatano\\" meaning \\"wing\\". This is a reference to the length of the fore wing. When Ordralfabetix sirophatanis was described, it was one of three hundred identified arthropod species that have been found in the Oise ambers. Of the three hundred arthropod species, seven planthopper families are represented: Achilidae, Dictyopharidae, Lophopidae, Ricaniidae, Nogodinidae, and Tropiduchidae plus another family which has not been formally described. O. sirophatanis was the second Lophopidae species to be described from the fossil record of Europe. The first species Baninus thuringiorum was described by Szwedo and Wappler in 2006 from specimens found in the Messel fossil site. Description The O. sirophatanis type specimen is a well-preserved almost complete adult left fore-wing, called a tegmen, plus portions of the head and pronotum, the right clavus and portions of the left hind-wing. The tip of the left fore-wing is still covered in a small amount of amber. The fore-wing has a total length of and at its widest it is . Shorter than the fore-wing, the hind wing has an estimated length of while the width is not known. Similar to members of the Sarebasa+ group of genera in Lophopidae, such as Serida and Pyrilla, Ordralfabetix is separated from the other genera by the several characters. The distinct shape of the shallowly concave fore-wing with an elongated postclaval margin, called the tornus, and a rounded wing tip. The venation of the wing tip has distinct oblique subapical line of veinlets. The narrow costal area of the wing has veinlets running almost the entire length, excluding the base region, and is longer than the clavus.

He was highly regarded for his commitment to international understanding and peace.  Biography  = Early years = Wagenfeld was born to Bauhaus designer Wilhelm Wagenfeld and Elsa n√©e Heinrich. He attended the Volksschule (primary school) in Oberweimar (1935 to 1938) and in Berlin Schlachtensee (1938 and 1939). From 1939 to 1943 he attended the Dreilinden Oberschule (high school) in Berlin Wannsee until his mother sent him out of Berlin due to the escalating bombing raids. He briefly attended high school in Weimar but his openly anti-Nazi attitude made the situation unsafe and he returned to live with his mother in Berlin. In Berlin in 1944 he received secret tuition in English and Mathematics from a retired Jewish teacher named Dr. Skutsch. In September 1944, Himmler, Reichsfuehrer of the SS, issued the decree that all men between 16 and 60 enter the Volksturm. When Wagenfeld turned 16 that December, he avoided the Volkssturm by enlisting in an Air Force Auxiliary unit and managed to survive the months till the end of the war without significant combat experience. From the age of 16-18 Wagenfeld was held British prisoner of war in the Munster Training Area (Munsterlager) in the L√ºneburg Heath. He ‚Äòdoctored‚Äô his discharge papers and discharged himself from prison camp in March 1947. From 1947-1948 he continued his schooling at the Lilienthal High School in Berlin Lichterfelde where he completed his Abitur (Matriculation). In October 1948 Wagenfeld commenced studying Ancient Languages and Philosophy at the Philosophical Faculty of the Free University Berlin but switched to the Science Faculty in 1949 with Physics as his major subject. He completed his Vordiplom (Bachelor of Science equivalent) in Physics in 1952. From October 1952 to 1958 he held a position of Assistant at the Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG in Berlin, in the department of Professor Dr. Kurt Moli√®re, while continuing to study Physics part-time at the Free University. Wagenfeld‚Äôs Diplom thesis (Masters of Science equivalent) was for a project carried out at the Fritz-Haber-Institute under supervision of Professor Moli√®re (‚ÄúUntersuchung √ºber die Feinstrukturen der Elektronenbeugungsreflexe durchstrahlter Mikrokristalle‚Äú / Investigation of the fine structures in electron diffraction patterns of irradiated microcrystals). The Institute recommended Wagenfeld turn this thesis into his PhD. Wagenfeld did so, and in 1958 was awarded the degree Dr. rer. nat. (Experimental Physics) for the inaugural dissertation ‚ÄúInterferenzbrechung von Elektronenwellen in durchstrahlten Mikrokristallen bei simultaner Anregung mehrerer Interferenzen‚Äù (Interference diffraction of electron waves in irradiated microcrystals with simultaneous excitation of multiple interferences). = Career = In 1956 Wagenfeld married doctoral student and chemistry graduate Elma Hohlweg, with whom he had three children. Wagenfeld continued working at the Fritz Haber Institute on techniques based on the Nobel Prize winning discovery of his mentor, Prof. Max von Laue. At a conference in celebration of von Laue‚Äôs 80th birthday in 1959, Wagenfeld met a great pioneer in the field of crystal diffraction, Prof. Paul Peter Ewald, Head of the Physics Department at Brooklyn Polytechnic in New York City. In 1962-1963 Wagenfeld moved to the UK and worked as a research assistant at Bristol University. Following a meeting at a conference in Rome, he was invited by Prof. John Cowley to take the position of Senior Lecturer in the School of Physics at the University of Melbourne from the beginning of 1964. Here Wagenfeld worked with David Cockayne (later Professor at Oxford University) and supervised several Masters and Ph. D. students. In 1966 Wagenfeld organized a Summer School for the International Union of Crystallography in Warburton near Melbourne, where he consolidated his relationship with Paul Ewald who was attending as an international guest. In 1967 Wagenfeld was promoted to Reader in Physics at University of Melbourne but instead accepted an appointment as Associate Professor at New York‚Äôs Brooklyn Polytechnic, on the Ewald‚Äôs recommendation, now Professor Emeritus. Moving to the United States, Wagenfeld worked in Prof. Dick Stern‚Äôs research group on Low-energy electron diffraction and X-Ray Diffraction. He became good friends with the new Head of Department, Prof. Helmut Juretschke. One of the attractions of living in New York was the opportunity to develop the friendship and working relationship with Ewald. The Ewalds lived in New Milford, Connecticut, and the Wagenfeld family would visit regularly. In 1969, Wagenfeld met and established a relationship with Ewald‚Äôs son-in-law, the theoretical physicist Hans Bethe, who had won the Physics Nobel Prize for his work on stellar nucleosynthesis in 1968. During this time Wagenfeld also worked as a consultant at IBM‚Äôs component division in East Fishkill, NY; amongst other projects he consulted on electron and Xray diffraction. In 1972 Wagenfeld returned to Berlin‚Äôs Fritz Haber Institute as Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter (Research Scientist) of the Max Planck Society and worked in Dr. Gerhard Borrmann‚Äôs group on X-Ray absorption (cf. the Borrmann Effect) until 1975. In that year he was awarded his Habilitation in Theoretical Physics by the Technical University Berlin. Attracted by the prospect of helping transform the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) into a research university, Wagenfeld returned to Australia in 1975, accepting a Professorial appointment in the Applied Physics Department. He was appointed Head of the Applied Physics Department in 1978. Wagenfeld was influential in the establishment of RMIT‚Äôs Research Committee in 1977 under the chairmanship of (then Dr. later Prof.) Brian Smith and was the first editor of RMIT‚Äôs research report. He was a strong promoter of post-graduate research degrees before they were officially sanctioned by the Victoria Post Secondary Education Commission. Under his leadership the Applied Physics Department enrolled some of RMIT‚Äôs first Masters students and its second PhD candidate and established collaborative research programs with other University departments. His collaboration with David Beanland and the Department of Communications and Electronic Engineering was decisive in establishing the Microelectronics and Materials Technology Centre. Wagenfeld promoted collaboration between RMIT and industrial and government research laboratories (including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Australian Defence Services Laboratory) in the form of jointly supervised post-graduate programs. The Professional Experience program allowed undergraduate students to participate in research in those laboratories. Wagenfeld also persuaded the Australian Institute of Physics to fund the first Australian Conference on Applied Physics in Rockhampton Australia in 1979 and held the second Applied Physics Conference at RMIT in 1981. Wagenfeld‚Äôs contributions to industrial research extended far beyond RMIT. In discussions with the Australian Federal Ministers Barry Jones and John Button, Wagenfeld advocated for greater scientific and industrial research collaboration. He also initiated contact with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and hosted the Australia China Workshop on Advanced Materials at RMIT in 1984. Wagenfeld had deep concern for issues of environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, social responsibility and the arms race. Wagenfeld influenced RMIT‚Äôs decision not to accept research funding from the United States Strategic Defence Initiative (‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù) Missile Defence program in the 1980s. He played a major role in establishing RMIT‚Äôs Context Curriculum, a general education program designed to stimulate students‚Äô awareness between their professional specialty and larger world issues. As President of the Australian branch of Scientists against Nuclear Armament, Wagenfeld attended domestic and international conferences and had contact with eminent peace advocates in Australia and overseas. Concerned by the escalating arms race in the 1980s, and with the strong belief that young people can change the world, Wagenfeld established the Youth Building the Future Conference, a series of conferences uniting young people from a wide range of cultures. The inaugural Youth Building the Future Conference, held in 1987 at Lorne, Victoria, was attended by students from 15 countries of Europe, America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Subsequent conferences were held in Canada, Argentina, Egypt, Norway, Jordan and again in Australia in 1997. When he retired in 1993, he was appointed RMIT‚Äôs first Professor Emeritus. He continued his research work at the university for the next years. He died after a long illness in 2005.  Awards  In 1990 Wagenfeld was appointed the first Institute Fellow of RMIT in recognition of his role in expanding research at RMIT, especially in Applied Physics.

G. Grace played in 32 matches in the 1871 English cricket season, 25 of which are recognised as first-class. His main roles in 1871 were as captain of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and as both match organiser and captain of the United South of England Eleven (USEE). In addition, he represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture and the South in the North v South series. 1871 was a cold, wet summer but nevertheless one of Grace's best seasons as a batsman for he scored 2,739 runs including 10 centuries in first-class matches at an average of 78.25, the first time anyone had scored over 2,000 runs in an English season. It was arguably his most successful season and was described by a leading cricket historian as his annus mirabilis. Background Having begun his top-class career in 1864 at the age of 15, Grace had by the 1871 season established himself as the sport's outstanding player.Rae, p.78. He was unmarried and still living with his parents and his younger brother Fred Grace at the family home in Downend, near Bristol.Rae, p.102. Grace turned 23 in July 1871 and was a medical student at Bristol Medical School, having enrolled there in October 1868. Derek Birley records that it was at this time, \\"scorning the puny modern fashion of moustaches\\", that Grace grew the enormous black beard that made him so recognisable. In addition, his \\"ample girth\\" had developed for he weighed 15 stone (95 kg) in his early twenties.Midwinter, p.31. Grace was a non-smoker but he enjoyed good food and wine.Birley, p.148. Grace in 1871 was principally involved with four teams: the Gentlemen, Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the United South of England Eleven (USEE). Gloucestershire was then a new club, generally understood to have been formally constituted in 1870 and had played its first two first-class matches that season.Birley, p.104. Grace had joined MCC in 1869.Rae, pp.78‚Äì79. The USEE had been founded in 1865 and Grace had played for it occasionally but he formally joined the club in 1870 as its match organiser, for which he received payment, though he played for expenses only.Birley, p.105. 1871 was a wet summer and, even when the rain relented, there was a persistent chilly wind.Midwinter, p.32. Grace, however, had the skill and resilience to cope with adverse conditions and some of his best batting performances were achieved on wet wickets. May: the season begins Grace began the season on 8 May playing for MCC against a Colts XV at Lord's. He took 7/56 in the Colts' first innings and then scored 44 and 31, but the Colts won by 34 runs. In the opening first-class fixture, Grace played a brilliant innings of 181 for MCC against Surrey at Lord's, enabling MCC to win by an innings and 23 runs. A week later, playing for MCC against Yorkshire, also at Lord's, his second innings of 98 (run out) in a low scoring game effectively decided the match which MCC won by 55 runs. After scoring another century (118) in an all- amateurs match, he played for South v North at Lord's and scored 178, enabling his team to win by an innings and 49 runs. June On 1 June, Grace scored his fourth century in five matches with 162 for the Gentlemen against Cambridge University, following up with bowling figures of 7/103 in the University's second innings. In his next match, he made his first appearance of the season for Gloucestershire, this time playing against MCC and, though he made relatively modest scores of 49 and 34 not out, he still finished on the winning side, by 5 wickets. Apart from an innings of 88 for MCC against Middlesex, Grace had low scores in the rest of June and no great success as a bowler either. Gloucestershire defeated Surrey at The Oval by an innings and 60 runs, a significant victory for the new county club against one of the established counties. Surrey batted first and were bowled out for 161, largely due to George Strachan who took 5/45. Grace opened the Gloucestershire first innings with his brother E. M. but both were dismissed cheaply and Gloucestershire had to recover from a position of 7‚Äì2 to make 315, half- centuries being scored by Charles Gordon, Fred Grace and Robert Miles. James Street took 7/141 for Surrey. Batting again, Surrey needed 154 to avoid the innings defeat but were bowled out for 94 by E. M. and W. G. Grace who took all ten wickets between them, brother Fred helping the cause by holding three catches. Following successive matches for MCC at Lord's against Cambridge University and Oxford University, Grace travelled up to Grantham with the United South of England Eleven (USEE), his first engagement with them in 1871. It was a match scheduled for three days with the USEE playing 11 against 22 and winning by five wickets. Grace did not bowl, leaving that to James Lillywhite, James Southerton and Ned Willsher. He scored 13 and 56 not out including the winning hit. Grace travelled back to London from Grantham to play at The Oval for Gentlemen of the South against Players of the South. Although it was a relatively high-scoring match, he could only make 4 and 11, his team losing by just 3 runs. Players struggled on the first day and were dismissed for 173, Grace taking 3/50, the innings bolstered by Henry Charlwood's 77. Gentlemen reached 187‚Äì6 by the close and finished at 323 on the second day. 150 behind, Players now began a recovery and amassed 278‚Äì4 at close of play with Ted Pooley 93 not out after Harry Jupp had been dismissed for 97. Pooley went on to 125 on the final morning and Players were eventually dismissed for 398 (Grace 1/32). Needing 248, Gentlemen were dismissed for 245 having reached 239‚Äì7, Southerton taking 6/95. July The first two Gentlemen v Players matches of 1871 were held in early July at Lord's, starting Monday, 3 July, and the Oval, starting on Thursday, 6 July. The Lord's fixture was drawn as a result of rain. Gentlemen won the toss and batted first, scoring 208. Grace, who opened with A. N. Hornby, scored 50. Players responded with 180, Grace taking 1/16, and Gentlemen then scored 146 all out, Grace making 37. There was no time left for the second Players innings to begin. At the Oval, there was better weather and the match was completed, Gentlemen winning by 5 wickets. They batted first and totalled 299. Grace made only 16 and the outstanding innings was 97 by Walter Hadow. Players struggled and only the efforts of Robert Carpenter, who was 72 not out, enabled them to reach 182. Following on, Players were better in the second innings and scored 260 to leave Gentlemen needing 144 to win. Grace scored 43 as they easily reached 145‚Äì5. Then Grace cut loose again with an outstanding innings of 189 not out (carrying his bat) in a Married v Single game at Lord's, his Single team winning by an innings and 73 runs. This innings was played on a \\"sticky wicket\\" after rain and many people considered it the finest of Grace's career, though Grace himself disagreed.Rae, pp.96‚Äì97. In his Reminiscences, he modestly says he \\"played for the Single side and made 189 (not out)\\". The match was a benefit for Ned Willsher and the second day was rained off so Grace helped to arrange another match for Willsher, played at Mote Park, Maidstone in September.Grace, pp.114‚Äì115. Grace began the innings cautiously and took fifteen minutes to score his first run but then, records Rae, he \\"scored at a cracking pace\\".Rae, p.96. MCC Secretary Harry Perkins had no doubts and insisted that it was Grace's greatest-ever performance with rain frequently stopping play and making the wicket at times \\"unplayable\\". When MCC played Kent at Lord's, Grace scored 51 out of 183 as MCC won easily by an innings and 9 runs within two days. He scored 146 21 for MCC against Surrey at the Oval, but his team lost by just one wicket despite having had to follow on. Grace took 4/48 in the Surrey second innings as they struggled to reach their target of 111. MCC then played Sussex at Lord's, winning a low-scoring game by 8 wickets in only two days. Grace batted once and scored 59, the only half-century in the match. Grace produced his season highlight in another South v North match, played at the Oval, when he made his highest career score to date of 268, having been dismissed by Jem Shaw for nought in the first innings. It was to no avail as the match was drawn. The occasion produced a memorable and oft-quoted comment by Jem Shaw who ruefully said: \\"I puts the ball where I likes and he puts it where he likes\\". The match was a benefit for H. H. Stephenson.Grace, p.115. During July, Grace made two appearances for the USEE at Uppingham and Broughton, both being \\"odds\\" matches with 11 against 22. At Uppingham, Grace scored only one run but took 25 wickets. The match was drawn. At Broughton, the match was ruined by rain and Grace made 18 in his sole innings. August Beginning on 3 August, Grace captained Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire at the Clifton College Close Ground in Bristol. He scored 78 and 55 against an attack consisting mostly of Alfred Shaw and Jem Shaw. The match was drawn. Next came a North v South match at St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury which the South won by 100 runs, Grace scoring 31 and 40 including the 2,000th run of his first-class season so far. After another century for the MCC Gentlemen against Kent, he played for Gentlemen v Players at the Royal Brunswick Ground, Brighton, in August and, for the second time, followed a first innings \\"duck\\" with a double century. As on the previous occasion, the feat was achieved in a benefit match, this time for John Lillywhite.Grace, pp.116‚Äì117. In the second innings, Grace and his brother Fred shared a second wicket partnership of 241 till Fred was out for 98, W.G. going on to score 217.Grace, p.117. Beginning on 17 August, Grace captained Gloucestershire against Surrey at Clifton College Close and was for once overshadowed by a teammate as he scored only 23 while Thomas Matthews compiled 201. Gloucestershire totalled exactly 400 and won the match by an innings and 9 runs. Grace took four wickets in Surrey's first innings. When Gloucestershire went to Trent Bridge to play Nottinghamshire, Grace scored 79 and 116 but his team lost by 10 wickets after Jem Shaw took 13 wickets in the match. It was the first time that anyone had scored a century on the ground and Grace's presence ensured a bumper crowd with over ¬£400 being taken at the gate. This money went a long way towards the ¬£1500 that Nottinghamshire needed to erect the Trent Bridge Pavilion. September Grace played 4 matches in September including three for the USEE in Birmingham, Chichester and Chesterfield. His final first-class match of the season was at Mote Park, Maidstone where his own select team played Kent in a benefit match for Ned Willsher. The match was drawn; Grace scored 81 not out and 42 not out and took ten wickets in the match with 6‚Äì67 and 4‚Äì83. Gloucestershire Gloucestershire played four county matches in 1871. They twice defeated Surrey by an innings margin but had less success against Nottinghamshire, drawing with them at Clifton College Close Ground and then losing by 10 wickets at Trent Bridge. The team had certain regulars but tended to include occasional and even guest players, some of whom weakened the side, whereas Nottinghamshire generally turned out a full-strength eleven. The key Gloucestershire players were the three Graces, batsman Thomas Matthews, wicket-keeper James Bush (who was also an England rugby union international), slow left-armer Robert Miles and all-rounders George Strachan and Frank Townsend. Newcomers in 1871 were Frederic Carter and George Wyatt who both made a number of appearances over the next few seasons. Season summary In all first-class matches in 1871, a total of 17 centuries were scored and Grace accounted for 10 of them, including the first century in a first-class match at Trent Bridge.Rae, p.99. He averaged 78.25 and the next best average by a batsman playing more than a single innings was 39.57, barely more than half his figure. His aggregate for the season was 2,739 and this was the first time that anyone had scored 2,000 first-class runs in a season; Harry Jupp was next best with 1,068. Grace's highest score was 268 for South v. North at The Oval. He took 79 wickets at 17.02 with a best analysis of 7‚Äì67. He claimed five wickets in an innings 5 times and twice had 10 in a match.Rae, p.495. Besides Grace and apart from Jupp and Ted Pooley who were the highest runscorers, other leading batsmen in 1871 were Richard Daft, Robert Carpenter, Fred Grace, Henry Charlwood and Ephraim Lockwood. The leading bowlers were James Southerton, Alfred Shaw, Jem Shaw, Frank Farrands, Grace, Ned Willsher, James Street and Tom Emmett. Aftermath According to Harry Altham, 1871 was Grace's annus mirabilis, except that he produced another outstanding year in 1895.Altham, p.126. Grace summarised it as \\"one of my best seasons\\" as he scored 10 centuries.Grace, pp.118‚Äì119. He later told Bernard Darwin that he had needed to apply great patience when batting in 1871 because of the generally wet weather which produced poor wickets and difficult batting conditions.Darwin, p.42. Simon Rae remarked that cricket enthusiasts still argue about Grace's \\"greatest season\\" and that 1871 features in any such discussion. Grace had numerous nicknames during his career including \\"The Doctor\\", after he achieved his medical qualification; \\"The Old Man\\", as he reached the veteran stage; and most auspiciously \\"The Champion\\".Altham, p.122.In the famous poem At Lord's by Francis Thompson, Grace was hailed as \\"The Champion of the Centuries\\". He was first acclaimed as \\"the Champion Cricketer\\" by John Lillywhite's Cricketer's Companion (aka \\"Green Lilly\\") in recognition of his exploits in 1871.Midwinter, p.34. But Grace's great year was marred by the death of his father in December. Grace and his younger brother Fred still lived with their mother at the family home in Downend and they had to increase their involvement with the USEE to pay for their medical studies.Midwinter, p.35.Rae, pp.102‚Äì105.

His work also attracted much attention in the Netherlands in the middle of the 17th century among those concerned to limit state power; the Bedekte konsten (Hidden Arts) (1657) of Gerard van Wassenaer, and almost identical Nauwkeurige consideratie van staet (Close Consideration of the State) (1662) attributed to Pieter de la Court, were heavily influenced by Clapmarius.Willem Frijhoff, Marijke Spies, Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1650, hard-won unity (2004), p. 327; Google Books.Menno Spiering, Machiavelli: figure-reputation (1996), p. 140; Google Books. Another work was Nobilis adolescentis triennium, first published in Christian Becmann's Manuductio ad Latinam linguam (1611) and often reprinted. In it Clapmarius made the humanist case for mastery of the Latin language, as preparation for a career for example in diplomacy or the law.Jill Kraye (editor), The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism (1996), p. 208; Google Books.

It holds the head, legs, wings and abdomen. It is also called mesosoma or cephalothorax in other arthropods. It is formed by the prothorax, mesothorax and metathorax and comprises the scutellum; the cervix, a membrane that separates the head from the thorax; and the pleuron, a lateral sclerite of the thorax. In dragonflies and damselflies the mesothorax and metathorax are fused together to form the synthorax. In some insect pupae, like the mosquitoes', the head and thorax can be fused in a cephalothorax. Members of suborder Apocrita (wasps, ants and bees) in the order Hymenoptera have the first segment of the abdomen fused with the thorax, which is called the propodeum. The head is connected to the thorax by the occipital foramen, enabling a wide range of motion for the head. In most flying insects, the thorax allows for the use of asynchronous muscles.

Fairway was the best horse of his generation in Britain at two, three and four years old, winning the St Leger Stakes, the Champion Stakes (twice) and the Eclipse Stakes. He retired as a five-year-old in 1930 and went on to become a successful and influential sire., pp.206 Background Lord Derby Fairway was bred in England by his owner Lord Derby who also bred both of his parents. His sire Phalaris was an outstanding sprinter who went on to become the most influential stallion of the 20th Century. His dam, Scapa Flow, also produced Fairway's sister Fair Isle who won the 1000 Guineas and his brother Pharos who finished second in The Derby and sired Nearco. As a two-year-old, Fairway was trained by George Lambton at Lord Derby's Stanley House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. When Lambton became Lord Derby's racing manager at the end of 1927, Frank Butters took over as the colt's trainer. He was ridden in most of his races by Lord Derby's Dewsbury-born stable jockey Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Weston. Racing career =1927: two-year-old season= Fairway began his racecourse career when he ran unplaced in a maiden race at York in May. He won his remaining three races in 1927; the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot, the July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in September. By the time of his Doncaster win he was being talked of as a potential Derby winner. He sustained a minor injury in the last-named race however, and did not appear again that season. In the Free Handicap, he was rated the joint-best colt of the year. =1928: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1928, Fairway developed a mouth abscess (or \\"boils\\") which forced his late withdrawal from the 2000 Guineas. He was then aimed at the Derby, running his trial in the Newmarket Stakes. Fairway impressed observers before the race and won very easily by two lengths after \\"sailing past\\" the strongly fancied Black Watch. At Epsom Fairway was made favourite, but the highly-strung colt became upset by the huge crowd when going down to the start. He was never a threat in the race and finished ninth behind the 33/1 outsider Felstead. After the race, Tommy Weston said \\"he was beaten after six furlongs, probably because he had so much taken out of him before the actual start.\\" Fairway returned to his best in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown which he won by eight lengths from Royal Minstrel in record time In September he started 7/4 favourite for the St Leger, despite concerns that, as the son of sprinter, he would lack the stamina for the one and three quarter mile race. He was ridden with great confidence by Weston, coming from well off the pace to take the lead in the closing stages and win by one and a half lengths from Palais Royal and Cyclonic On his final start of the year he won the Champion Stakes at Newmarket by one and a half lengths \\"without being in any way hard pressed.\\" =1929: four-year-old season= At four, Fairway began with a one length win over three rivals in the Burwell Stakes at Newmarket and then took the Rous Memorial Stakes at Royal Ascot. At the July meeting at Newmarket he won the Princess of Wales's Stakes to take his winning run to six. In his next race he started favourite for the Eclipse Stakes but failed to show his best form and was beaten four lengths by Royal Minstrel. He was then off the course for three months before returning in October to win the Champion Stakes for the second time from Cyclonic. On his final start of the year he stepped up to two miles and a quarter to win the Jockey Club Cup, \\"cantering\\" to a three length victory over Palais Royal. =1930: five-year-old season= Fairway was kept in training at five with the intention of winning the Ascot Gold Cup, but was retired without running after sustaining a tendon injury. Assessment At the end of his four-year-old season the Bloodstock Breeders' Review described Fairway as \\"far and away the best horse in England, and probably in the world.\\"Randall, J. and Morris, T., A Century of Champions, Portway Press, Halifax, 1999, p. 80-81 In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Windsor the thirty-fifth best horse of the 20th Century and the twelfth best to be trained in Britain. Stud career Fairway stood as a stallion at the Woodlands Stud at Newmarket from 1931.Anne Peters,\\"Fairway\\", Thoroughbred Heritage. Retrieved 2019-10-05. He was Champion sire four times and three times second. He sired the Classic winners Blue Peter, Watling Street, Pay Up, Kingsway, Garden Path and Tide-way. His most influential son however, was the Champion sire Fair Trial. Since 1946 Fairway suffered from hindquarters problems and retired stallion. He died in November 1948. Pedigree *Fairway was inbred 3 √ó 4 to St. Simon. This means that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

He helped form the alternative rock band Aloysius in 2004, and was vocalist for an early line-up of what would later become the progressive metal band Garden Of. He was also one of four thereminists in Trondheim Thereminorkester. From 2008 until 2009 he hosted an experimental radio show called \\"Fluxusboks\\", that aired on Radio Revolt. He runs a label called Eonel Sound.  Early work  Eth first came to be known when his vocals were featured on the Monophobe single \\"Metermind\\", that gained significant rotation in July 2004 on NRK P3. Emerging from the \\"Klubb Kanin\\" club concept in Trondheim, where he performed under the moniker of Little Horse Deep, Eth provided music for a sound installation at Stor√•sfestivalen in 2007. The year before he took part in founding Trondheim Thereminorkester, Norway's only theremin orchestra. Historian Ola Nordal, writing in late 2006, dubbed Trondheim Thereminorkester's debut concert \\"legendary\\", and during 2007 the ensemble became a prominent part of the Trondheim music scene. In 2008, Eth Eonel played at the St√∏y P√• Landet festival, as Little Horse Deep.  Solo album  Eth Eonel's first solo album, Drawing Lines (1989) was released in 2011. It marked the first in a series of albums comprising his compositions from 1989 to the present. The album also made up the main part of a master's degree assignment in Music Technology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, in which the main goal was to produce an album \\"with an 80's sound\\", but with the means of new technology. While the label simply presented the album as being \\"alternative pop\\", as evidenced in his master's degree report, Eth Eonel draws a lot of influence from the 80's synthpop, with elements as well from progressive rock and avant-rock (odd time signatures, fusion of different genres). The album was furthermore mastered by the avant-rock musician and recording engineer Bob Drake.

The role of CAP in EBPR was elucidated using culture-independent approaches such as 16S rRNA clone banks that showed the Betaproteobacteria dominated lab-scale EBPR reactors. Further work using clone banks and fluorescence in situ hybridization identified a group of bacteria, closely related to Rhodocyclus as the dominant member of lab-scale communities. Phylogeny Currently, no cultured isolates of CAP exist, so the phylogeny of CAP strains is based purely of molecular biology techniques. To date, the polyphosphate kinase (ppk1) and the PHA synthase (phaC) genes have been used to characterise CAP populations at a higher resolution that 16S rRNA. The ppk1 phylogeny is more frequently used and groups CAP into two major divisions: type I and type II. Each of these types has a number of clades that are given a letter designation, e.g. IA, IIA, IIB, IIC. An environmental survey of wastewater treatment plants and natural waterways in California and Wisconsin in the USA revealed at least five CAP I (IA .. IE) clades and seven CAP II (IIA .. IIG) clades. Metabolism CAP has yet to be cultured, but the ability to enrich lab-scale EBPR communities with up to 80% CAP has enabled research into its metabolism using meta-omic approaches. EBPR is generally associated with three stages: anaerobic, aerobic, and settling. For CAP to dominate in EBPR reactors, they must be able to thrive under these conditions. During the anaerobic phase, CAP can take up volatile fatty acids and store these simple carbon sources intracellularly as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). At the same time, intracellular polyphosphate is degraded to form ATP, releasing phosphate into the medium. During the subsequent aerobic phase, PHAs are used for energy production and phosphate is taken up from the medium to form polyphosphate. Genomic reconstruction from an EBPR reactor enriched with CAP IIA revealed it to contain two different types of phosphate transporters, the high-affinity Pst and low-affinity Pit transporters, as well as using the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) glycogen degradation pathway. Furthermore, the CAP IIA genome contains nitrogen and CO2 fixation genes, which indicate CAP has adapted to environments limited in carbon and nitrogen. A discrepancy between the genomic data and reactor performance data was the lack of a functional respiratory nitrate reductase gene. Previous work had shown CAP could use nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, but the genomic data indicate the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene could not function in the electron transport chain, as it lacked the necessary quinol reductase subunit. To resolve these issues, lab-scale EBPR reactors enriched with CAP IA and CAP IIA were tested for their nitrate-reduction capabilities. CAP IA was able to couple nitrate reduction to phosphate uptake, while the genomically characterised CAP IIA could not.

One of Odoevsky's lines, \\"Iz iskry vozgoritsa plamya\\" (–ò–∑ –∏—Å–∫—Ä—ã –≤–æ–∑–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—Å—è –ø–ª–∞–º—è, One spark will start a flame), has come down in history as a long-lasting slogan of the Russian revolutionary movement. It was chosen as a motto (signed as: the \\"Decembrists' reply to Pushkin\\") for the Lenin-founded newspaper Iskra, also giving the magazine its title, which means \\"spark\\". Biography Alexander Odoevsky was born in Saint Petersburg, to an old family of Russian aristocrats. He received a high quality home education and in 1821 joined the military. One of his best friends and a major influence was his relative, the playwright Aleksander Griboyedov. By 1825 Odoevsky had begun writing poetry, but few of his early works remained, The Ball (1825), a critique of high society life, being one of them. In late 1824 Odoevsky joined the secret Northern Society and became part of its most radical contingent. On December 13, 1825, he supported Kondraty Ryleev who expressed the Society members' will to \\"give their lives to the first attempt at bringing freedom to Russia\\". On December 14 (25) Odoevsky was one of the commanders of the mutineers in the Senate Square where three thousand military men gathered to refuse to swear allegiance to the new Tsar, Nicholas I of Russia, proclaiming instead their loyalty to Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and the Russian Constitution. After the coup's failure he was arrested, sent to the Petropavlovskaya fortress, later convicted, sentenced to hard labour, and deported to Siberia. Odoevsky's best-known poems, including Prophetic strings' igniting sounds (Strun ve‚Ä≤shchikh pla‚Ä≤mennye zvu‚Ä≤ki) where his famous line \\"One spark will start a flame\\" comes from, were written in the late 1820s - early 1830s, first in prison in Petersburg, then at a Siberian factory he was sent to work in. In the early 1833 Odoevsky was relieved from his sentence of hard labour and sent to a settlement in Irkutsk, then moved to Tobolsk. In August 1837 he found himself amongst several Decembrists who, by a special decree of Nicholas I, had been transferred to serve in the Caucasus. As a sentry in a Nizhegorodsky dragoon regiment, he forged close friendship with Mikhail Lermontov, an officer there, who responded to the news of Odoevsky's death in 1839 with a tribute (\\"I knew him. We wandered side by side...\\") that became famous in its own right. In Odoevsky's lifetime only the play Saint Bernard was published (in Sovremennik 1838, Vol.X). In 1862 a volume of his collected poetry was published in Leipzig. Its expanded version came out in 1883 in Saint Petersburg.

After his defeat, Dur√°n retired, and became a supporter of √Ålvaro Uribe. Death After his retirement from politics, Dur√°n moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in order to visit his daughter Sonia, the wife of the Colombian ambassador to Malaysia. Dur√°n died in Kuala Lumpur of a respiratory infection in 1998 at the age of 78. His remains were returned to Colombia.

It stars G√©rard Depardieu, Gis√®le Casadesus, Claire Maurier, Maurane, and Fran√ßois-Xavier Demaison. The film tells the story of an illiterate man who bonds with an older, well-read woman. Plot Germain is a 45-year-old, illiterate handyman. As a child, he was bullied at school for being a slow reader, by both the teachers and other students. His mother kept reminding him that he was clumsy and an unwanted child, and did not give him much love. He is a loyal man, with a good heart. He lives in a trailer he parks close to his mother's house, where he cultivates a vegetable garden. He earns some extra money by selling his vegetables at the weekly farmers' market, borrowing a truck from the bar where he is a regular customer with his friends. His girl friend Annette is a younger woman who drives the local bus; she truly loves this sweet, simple and loving man. One afternoon Germain meets Margueritte, a delicate, 95-year-old woman who sits on the same bench with him to feed pigeons. He has observed the 19 birds so often that he knows each and has named them. He sees that she is highly educated, and learns she had worked as a scientist with the World Health Organization. She lives in a retirement home in the village and reads frequently. They connect over a text from The Plague by Albert Camus. Because Germain is barely literate, Margueritte starts to read the book aloud to him. Slowly he starts to appreciate the beauty of words and sentences, because he is a good listener and he has a vivid imagination. Germain is affected by the symbolism Camus uses in this philosophical novel, expanding his horizons. The pair meet every day to continue their reading sessions. A friendship develops. Margueritte eventually gives him her old dictionary. In it he tries to find words that he's interested in, but because he can't spell, he finds the dictionary too frustrating. He decides to return it when Margueritte invites him to her place for tea. She tells him that her eyesight is gradually fading, and that she will soon no longer be able to walk unassisted. Germain decides to reverse roles and try to read to her, but first he must improve his reading skills. With Annette's support he learns to read a story aloud to Margueritte. Shortly thereafter, Germain finds his mother dead at home, and is distraught. At the notary, he learns that his mother owned her house, which he had thought she rented. She had accumulated a sizeable fortune from strict saving, and always intended to bequeath that to him, but had never told him. Meanwhile, Annette announces she is pregnant. Germain had hesitated to have children, believing he could not offer them enough. Annette tells him not to worry: he can give love. When Margueritte is forced to leave her retirement home for a lesser one in Flanders, she puts aside her dictionary for Germain. He traces her down and brings her back to live with him at his mother's house. On their return, he reads her a poem written for her.

Two putti engage in no holds barred wrestling Giovanni di Ser Giovanni, known as Lo Scheggia, or \\"the Splinter\\" (1406 in San Giovanni Valdarno -1486 ) was an Italian painter, brother of the famous Masaccio. Biography Born in San Giovanni in Altura, now San Giovanni Valdarno, he moved with his family to Florence in 1417 . Between 1420 and 1421 he came into relationship with Lorenzo Bicci, probably as an assistant in his workshop. In 1426 he was registered in Pisa as a guarantor for his brother Masaccio, and he refused his brother's inheritance in 1428, for the inconsistency. In 1429 the artist had his own workshop in Florence in the parish of Sant'Apollinare. In 1430 he joined the Guild of Saint Luke. He joined the \\"Guild of the Legnaioli\\" as a \\"forzerinario\\", or chest maker; then in 1433 he matriculated in the Art of Doctors and Apothecaries. Between 1436 and 1440 he provided the cartoons for the inlays of the Sacristy of the Florentine Cathedral. In these years, he manufactured luxury furniture especially for the clients in town and in the country he produced altarpieces and frescoes, a signed fragment of the latter being the Martyrdom of San Lorenzo in church of San Lorenzo in San Giovanni Valdarno. In 1449 on the occasion of the birth of Lorenzo de' Medici Lo Scheggia painted the Desco da parto with the Triumph of Fame now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Lo Scheggia died in 1486 and was buried in the basilica of Santa Croce. Also included in his catalog of works are: a Madonna and Child (1450), originally in the church of San Lorenzo in San Giovanni Valdarno and a tempera on panel depicting a Choir of Angel Musicians, part of the door from the vestry of the organ Oratory of San Lorenzo. In the former Abbey of Vallumbrosan Order in Soffena is also preserved a fine Annunciation, while in the Accademia Gallery in Florence is the so-called Adimari Cassone, a panel with a party scene set in a city landscape in perspective, in which the Florence Baptistery is recognisable.

Xylooligosaccharides have been commercially available since the 1980s, originally produced by Suntory in Japan.

His main interest was in the history of Medieval philosophy.Mark Montebello, Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f‚ÄôMalta (A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, pp. 64-65. Life =Beginnings= Callus was born at ≈ªebbuƒ°, Malta, on January 20, 1888.Biographical data from Daniel Callus: Historian & Philosopher (1994) by Mark Montebello, Malta University Press, Malta, pp. 21-49. =Formation= Callus joined the Dominicans in 1903 at 15 years of age, and studied with them at Rabat, Malta (1905‚Äì08). In 1906, after receiving his Minor Orders, he was sent to Fiesole, Italy, to pursue his studies there. Four years later, in 1910, he obtained the degree of Lector in Theology and Philosophy from the University of Florence. At the same university Callus undertook studies in philosophy, history of art, and Semitic languages. In 1910 Callus was sent to Rome where he was ordained to the priesthood on November 6 and pursued postgraduate studies at the Angelicum in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. In 1912 Callus was assigned to Rabat, Malta where he remained until 1921. At Rabat, Malta, he was appointed Acting Regent of Studies of the Studium Generale. In 1914 he was also appointed Professor of Dogmatic Theology at the bishop‚Äôs major seminary at Mdina, Malta. =Commitments= In 1921 Callus went to England for two years. He settled at Hawkesyard, Staffordshire as Acting Regent of Studies. Here, he gave lectures and prepared the examination ad gradum for the Master of Sacred Theology degree which he obtained in 1924 at Rome‚Äôs Pontificium Collegium Internationale Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, (the degree was officially conferred a year later). That same year, Callus was sent to Viterbo, Italy, as Regent of Studies. He stayed here just over a year. On May 1, 1924, was honored with the title \\"Master of Sacred Theology\\" bestowed by Procurator General of the Dominican Order. He then returned to Malta and was appointed Professor of Holy Scripture and Hebrew at the University of Malta (1924). He was also appointed Regent of Studies at the Dominicans‚Äô Studium Generale at Rabat, Malta. =At Oxford= In 1931 Callus resigned from all of his offices in Malta and permanently left for Hawkesyard, and then, a year later, for Oxford, England, where he stayed until his death. Here he was engaged in predominantly academic and intellectual work. At first he became a research student, exercising himself further in paleography. Later, he became part of a group of distinguished scholars and intellectuals so as to study Medieval Theology and Philosophy. Callus thus continued to mature his philosophical views and to extend his already wide horizon of knowledge. In 1938 he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy being the first Dominican since the reformation to take a degree at Oxford. Two years later in 1940 he was appointed Regent of Studies at Blackfriars, Oxford, an office he held for twelve years. That same year, the University of Malta awarded him the title of Emeritus Professor. In 1943 he was elected Member of the Medieval Academy of America, and in 1946 he was elected Member of the Committee of the Medieval Latin Dictionary of the British Academy. A year later, in 1947, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and the following year he became the first editor of Dominican Studies. In 1953 the University of Oxford conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts, and in that same year he was appointed Member of the Congregation of the University of Oxford. In 1962 he was also conferred the degree of Doctor of Literature ‚ÄòHonoris Causa‚Äô by the University of Malta. =Death= Callus traveled far and wide lecturing and addressing seminars and conferences on Medieval philosophers, and expounding his own philosophy. On March 25, 1965, he was in Malta celebrating his diamond jubilee as a Dominican. A month later, while still in Malta, he was taken ill, and died on May 26 at the Dominican hospital of St. Catherine‚Äôs in Attard. He was buried at the cemetery of ≈ªebbuƒ°, Malta, his birthplace, following an impressive funeral at the church of St. Dominic‚Äôs in Valletta. Works According to scholarly analysis and criticism, Callus‚Äô academic and intellectual endeavour is divided between his ‚ÄòMalta Period‚Äô (1912‚Äì1931) and his ‚ÄòOxford Period‚Äô. His publications from the first period, though interesting, are not of much interest to philosophy.Classified in Daniel Callus: Historian & Philosopher, Mark Montebello, Malta University Press, Malta, p. 141. His best scholarly contributions are all part of the latter period. They are not very numerous in number ‚Äì just 40 contributions ‚Äì but all of a very high calibre, both scientifically and, sometimes, philosophically.

The first church in the vicinity was established by St Cynfarwy (a 7th-century saint about whom little is known) in about 630, but no structure from that time survives. The present building contains a 12th- century baptismal font, indicating the presence of a church at that time, although extensive rebuilding in 1867 removed the datable features of the previous edifice. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is \\"a simple, rural church of Medieval origins\\". The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, one of nine in a combined parish, although there has not been an incumbent priest since September 2009. History and location St Cynfarwy's Church is set within a churchyard at the side of the road in the centre of Llechgynfarwy, a hamlet in Anglesey, north Wales. The settlement is in the countryside about to the north-west of Llangefni, the county town, and about from the port of Holyhead. According to the 19th-century Anglesey historian Angharad Llwyd, the first church was established here by St Cynfarwy in about 630. The date of the present structure is uncertain, although one 19th-century historian suggested that it might be from the 15th century. There was a church here before the 15th century, however, since the font is from the 12th century and a church was recorded in this location in the Norwich Taxation of 1254. On 5 November 1349, the possessions of the deceased clergyman who had been the incumbent priest of Llechgynfarwy were dealt with by an inquisition at Beaumaris, Anglesey ‚Äì one of several dead clergymen whose goods were considered that day. According to the historian Antony Carr, the timing suggests that the priests had been victims of the Black Death, and he notes that \\"the clergy as a class were hit particularly hard\\" by it. A chapel was added on the south side of the building in 1664. St Cynfarwy's was largely reconstructed in 1867 under Henry Kennedy, the architect of the Diocese of Bangor. Kennedy's work, which rebuilt the church \\"almost from the foundations\\" in the words of a 2009 guide to the buildings of the region, left no datable features. When Llwyd described the church in 1833, she called it a \\"spacious and handsome cruciform edifice\\", with transepts on the north and south sides; there is nothing on the north side of the present building apart from the porch in the north-west corner, added by Kennedy in 1867. St Cynfarwy's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, and is one of nine churches in the combined benefice of Bodedern with Llanfaethlu. As of 2012, the nine churches do not have an incumbent priest, and the position has been vacant since September 2009. The church is within the deanery of Llifon and Talybolion, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. People associated with the church include Owen Humphrey Davies, a 19th-century composer, conductor and quarry worker, who became a clergyman in his late forties. He was rector of the church from 1895 until his death in 1898. Architecture and fittings St Cynfarwy's is built in Early Decorated style using rubble masonry dressed with freestone. The roof is made from slate and has a stone bellcote decorated with Tudor roses at the west end. The arched inner door of the porch (which was added by Kennedy in 1867), with its \\"ornate hinges\\", leads into the north-west corner of the nave. Inside, the 19th- century roof with its exposed woodwork can be seen above the nave and chancel, which together measure 40 feet 3 inches by 16 ft 9 inches (12.3 by 5.1 m). There is no structural division between them, apart from two steps that lead up into the chancel. The 17th-century chapel is on the south side of the church, and the wooden trusses of its roof can also be seen. There are external buttresses to support the structure at the north-east corner and alongside the porch. The north wall of the church has a window of two lights (sections of window separated by mullions; the Perpendicular-style window in the south wall has three lights topped with trefoils (a pattern of three overlapping circles) set in a rectangular frame. The south wall of the chapel has a two-light window in an arch. Above it, there is a stone with the date \\"1664\\" and the initials \\"W B\\". These are the initials of William Bold, a member of the family owning an estate and house about from the church. The east window has two lights with three trefoils in the decorative stone tracery at the top, set in an arched frame with a hoodmould on the outer wall. Geometric patterns of stained glass, dating from about 1860, decorate the east window. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also noted a brass plate by the north nave window commemorating the 18th-century bequest of a Catherine Roberts to \\"two old housekeepers of unblemished character\\". The 12th-century stone font, which is in diameter and high, has a small circular bowl decorated with four panels carved with saltire crosses; a fifth panel is plain. It is set on a 19th-century base at the west end of the church. Monuments include one in the south chapel to Helen Bold (died 1631), the mother of William Bold. It has a large inscribed brass plate set in marble showing the genealogical links between the Bold family and the Tudor dynasty. There are two 18th-century memorials on the north wall of the nave, less elaborate than the Bold memorial. A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 said that the church's chalice, dated 1632, was \\"an interesting and very rare example\\" from the time of King Charles I (reigned 1625‚Äì1649), and had \\"a mixture of characteristics of different periods.\\" It has a hexagonal stem engraved in medieval style, with a base depicting the Crucifixion and a more modern \\"engraved feather-like decoration\\". The inscription and coat of arms record that it was donated by William Bold. It measures just under high and is about in diameter. The survey also noted a 19th-century silver eight-sided paten, decorated with similar engravings to the chalice. Assessment St Cynfarwy's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 12 May 1970, and has been listed because it is regarded as \\"a simple, rural church of Medieval origin.\\" Cadw (the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that although the church retains some medieval fabric and has some features that date from the 17th century, it \\"is largely of 19th-century character\\", calling it \\"a simple vernacular building\\".

Five trails are included in the National Register of Historic Places district: the Navajo Loop Trail, the Queen's Garden Trail, the Fairyland Trail, the Peekaboo Loop Trail and the Rim Trail. Mainly built between 1917 and 1935, these trails intersect to create a continuous network of trails. Portions of the trails were constructed by Civilian Conservation Corps labor from CCC Camp NP-3. Description The Navajo Loop Trail closely follows its original alignment, leading to the \\"Wall Street\\" section of the amphitheater. The Queen's Garden Trail covers the area between Sunrise and Sunset Points, leading to the Queen Victoria rock formation. The trail includes two tunnels. The Peekaboo Loop Trail is about long, starting at Bryce Point. The eastern portion of the loop enters Peekaboo Canyon, then crosses to Bryce Canyon, then back into the Peekaboo Canyon drainage along the base of the Wall of Windows formation. The trail returns through a tunnel. The Fairyland Trail is about long, running through Fairyland and Campbell canyons. The Rim Trail follows the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau for between Fairyland Point and Bryce Point. Portions of especially heavy use have asphalt paving. The Under-the-Rim Trail and the Riggs Spring Fire Trail connect to the day-hike trail system to provide access to the park's backcountry. Both are separately listed on the NRHP. The Bryce Canyon trail system was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 25, 1995. History Early trail construction focused on the area adjacent to the Bryce Canyon Lodge between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. It is believed that what is now the Navajo Loop Trail incorporates sections from 1917, immediately after the National Park Service took over administration from the U.S. Forest Service, and may include some earlier USFS-built paths. The Queen's Garden Trail, the Navajo Trail and the Peekaboo Loop Trail were completed about 1929, most for foot traffic, with horse and foot traffic for the Peekaboo trail. This trail featured a spring with a horse trough and water fountain. Additional connecting trails were built at this time. The remainder of the trails in the district were completed between 1929 and 1935. Portions of the Rim Trail and the Fairyland Trail were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934-35.

Such an arrangement is not stable on its own, and most bumpy torus designs use secondary fields or relativistic electrons to create a stable field inside the reactor. The main disadvantage of the classic magnetic mirror design is excessive plasma leakage through the two ends. The bumpy torus addresses this by connecting multiple mirrors together so fuel leaking from one mirror ends up in another. It is described as \\"bumpy\\" because the fuel ions comprising the plasma tend to concentrate inside the mirrors at a greater density than the leakage currents between mirror cells. Bumpy torus designs were an area of active research starting in the 1960s and continued until 1986 with the ELMO (ELectro Magnetic Orbit) Bumpy Torus at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. One, in particular, has been described: \\"Imagine a series of magnetic mirror machines placed end to end and twisted into a torus. An ion or electron that leaks out of one mirror cavity finds itself in another mirror cell. This constitutes a bumpy torus.\\" These demonstrated problems and most research on the concept has ended. Background =Simple mirrors= The magnetic mirror is among the simplest magnetic fusion energy machines in terms of physical complexity. It consists largely of a cylinder with powerful magnets at each end, although in practice the cylinder is lined with less powerful magnets to better shape the field. The resulting magnetic field has a shape roughly like the outside of a cigar, wide in the center of the cylinder and necking down at either end. Plasma consists of a gas of charged particles, electrons and the nuclei (ions) of the fusion fuel being used. In the presence of a magnetic field, charged particles orbit the lines of force. They also carry whatever momentum they had along the line of force, so in practice, the resulting motion is a spiral centered on the magnetic line. The mirror works by the way this motion is \\"trapped\\" at either end of the cylinder. As the ions approach the ends, other magnetic lines are converging on the same location, creating a rising field. Given the correct set of conditions, the ion will reverse its motion, essentially bouncing off the increasing field, thus the name mirror. Over a macroscopic time, individual ions bounce back and forth between the two mirror coils, remaining confined within the device. For any given field arrangement, there always remains some lines of force that are not curved as they approach the ends, most notably, the lines down the center of the mirror. Ions circling these lines may escape. Additionally, for any given magnetic strength, there are always some particles that will have enough energy that they will not reflect, and these two will escape. Calculations suggested that the rate of escape would be low enough to allow a long-running reactor. =Minimum B= It was pointed out very early in the controlled fusion program that such a device has a natural instability in the magnetic field arrangement. In any area where there is convexity in the field, there is a natural tendency for the ions to want to move to the outside of their original trajectory when they undergo collision. As a result of this motion, they wander outwards through the confinement area. When enough ions do this in any particular area, their electric charge modifies the magnetic field in such a way to further increase the curvature, causing a runaway effect that results in the plasma pouring out of the confinement area. This issue became known as the interchange instability and was found to be endemic to all mirrors of the late 1950s. The interchange instability was caused by convex areas of magnetic fields, and it was quickly shown by researchers in the UK that the opposite was also true: in a concave field, with the plasma on the \\"inside\\" of the concavity, would be naturally stable. This became known as the \\"minimum B configuration\\". Actually making such a field arrangement that does not leak fuel for other reasons is difficult, but by the mid-1960s several promising designs had emerged, notably the \\"tennis ball\\" or \\"baseball\\" configuration, and later, the yin-yang concept. All of these had the disadvantage of being much more complex, as well as larger for any given volume of plasma, which has a negative impact on the price performance of the design. =Bumpy torus= The bumpy torus is an attempt to correct the mirror's problems both with the interchange instability as well as its natural leakage out the ends. To control leakage, a number of mirrors were connected together end-to-end. This did not, by itself, reduce leakage, instead, it meant that particles leaked into another mirror. This may seem obvious at first glance, but the problem with this approach is that the resulting magnetic field is no longer linear down the axis, but curved, which increases the rate of interchange instability. However, when the machine as a whole is considered, as opposed to examining a single mirror cell, the overall field can be arranged as a net minimum-B configuration. Unfortunately, the bumpy torus' resulting field is subject to another problem, the resistive ballooning mode. The ELMO team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory proposed controlling this by injecting high- energy (\\"hot\\") electrons into the space between the outside of the mirror confinement field and the outside of the reactor itself. These electrons would produce a second magnetic field that would force the mirror's natural field away from the walls of the reactor, and modify the field as a whole to reduce the ballooning mode. =ELMO= The first example of the bumpy torus design was built as the ELMO at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1972. At first, the design demonstrated promising results, but as new diagnostic systems were added it became clear the system was not working as designed. In particular, the electron shell concept was nowhere near as powerful as predicted, and to add to the problems, the microwave heating system proved to have far lower efficiency than expected. A similar system was built in Nagoya, where direct measurement of the magnetic field demonstrated that only a few percent of the field created by the electrons was reaching the inside of the confinement area, not nearly enough to offset the instabilities. In 1988, a review of the entire field suggested that the electron confinement simply did not create the conditions needed, and further interest in the concept ended.

One of six churches of that denomination in the city, it was built in 1938 for the Congregational Church, which became part of the United Reformed Church in 1972. Its name commemorates William Allin Hounsom, a local man and longstanding member of the Congregational church in central Hove, who had wide-ranging business interests and landholdings across Sussex. The red-brick building, one of many local works by Brighton-based architect John Leopold Denman, is embellished with carvings that have been called \\"quite startling for a Nonconformist church\\". History Hove was a village and parish that developed rapidly as a residential area in the 19th century in response to the growth of neighbouring Brighton. The Union Chapel, founded in the 17th century in Brighton, extended its mission to Hove in 1823, when some members established a Sunday school and temporary place of worship in a building belonging to local resident John Vallance. The congregation grew, and land was bought in 1861 for a permanent church in the rapidly developing Cliftonville area of Hove. Cliftonville Congregational Church was designed by Horatio Nelson Goulty and opened in 1870 as the first Nonconformist church in the town. The church's local influence grew, and in 1899 it expanded its reach by opening a mission church, Rutland Hall, in the Aldrington area of Hove. A major benefactor of this new place of worship was William Allin Hounsom (1848‚Äì1934), a longstanding member of Cliftonville Congregational Church: he raised funds, gave land for the church and donated a house. Described as \\"a stalwart figure in Congregationalism in Sussex and beyond\\", Hounsom had also contributed money to the founding of a Congregational chapel at Horsted Keynes in West Sussex. In 1909, he was living at 41 New Church Road in Hove and was recorded as owning much land in the West Sussex parish of Yapton, near Arundel. He also held land in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex. Later in the 20th century he moved to 29 New Church Road, where he died on 28 January 1934. In the meantime, Rutland Hall's fortunes were declining: it was requisitioned for wartime use and most of the male members of the congregation were called up for military service. Rutland Hall was sold to finance the Hounsom Memorial Church. Small clerestory windows light the interior of the church. During the interwar period, Hove experienced rapid residential development, mostly northwards on to the southern slopes of the South Downs. Before the mid-1920s, the Old Shoreham Road to Shoreham-by-Sea formed the boundary of the urban area; thereafter, housing estates such as Hangleton grew rapidly (especially after it became part of the Borough of Hove in 1928). From the beginning, it was expected to be a large suburb; by 1935, houses covered . A group called the Sussex Pioneers, associated with the Sussex Congregational Union, was formed in the early 1930s with the aim of finding sites to establish new Congregational and Free churches. Its members included Congregational ministers and church laymen, including Hounsom himself. As a \\"quickly developing district\\" where no Nonconformist church had yet been founded, Hangleton was considered ideal, and in 1936 the Sussex Pioneers advised Cliftonville Congregational Church that a new place of worship should be founded there. Both parties started raising funds towards this, as did the Sussex Congregational Union; the Cliftonville Church made the largest contribution by selling Rutland Hall for ¬£2,000. (It continued in religious use‚Äîfirst by Plymouth Brethren until 1947 or later, and as of by Baptists as the West Hove Community Baptist Church.) The congregation also raised a further ¬£1,000, and ¬£50 was promised annually for three years to pay the minister's stipend. Several sites in the new suburb were considered, including Applesham Avenue, Hangleton Road and Nevill Avenue. The last named was found to be best, as the building could be set back from the road in a quiet setting, and a plot of land was purchased. Around this time, Rev. Jason S. Wright became the minister of the new church, and two local residents started a Sunday school in their house. They and the minister built up support for the church by visiting people in their houses and publicising it. Attendance at the Sunday school increased, and many people expressed an interest in attending services when the church opened. Some members of Cliftonville Congregational Church also decided to support the new venture by worshipping there when it opened. The name Hounsom Memorial Church was agreed upon in memory of William Allin Hounsom's life and activities, and the church was founded with that name on 16 March 1938. At the ceremony, William Allin Hounsom's niece, Rev. Stanley Blomfield (representing Cliftonville Congregational Church) and Scott Graves (representing the Sussex Pioneers) each laid a foundation stone. Other local Christian groups were also represented: The Salvation Army provided music, and the nearby Bishop Hannington Memorial Church (Anglican) hosted a party afterwards. Cliftonville Church formed a committee to supervise construction work and manage the affairs of the new church; members included Revs Blomfield and Wright and a member of the Sussex Congregational Union. Local architect John Leopold Denman, \\"the master of ... mid-century Neo-Georgian\\" architecture, was commissioned to design the church; in a presentation at the founding ceremony, he discussed his proposed plan. \\"There [are] aisles and clerestory windows without those divisional units which usually separate aisles from the central part of the church. As to the tower ... cost meant that it could not be too imposing.\\" The church would be heated by panels and flat radiators which were designed as part of the ceiling. Local firm Braybon & Son built the church, and it opened for worship on 17 September 1939. J. Ernest James , the Chairman-Elect of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, conducted the first service. The church had 70 members at this stage; when the membership roll was inaugurated in 1938 there were 52. It was officially constituted as a Congregational church on 22 October 1939, and on 8 November 1939 it was registered for marriages. After being constituted, the original administrative committee was replaced by a conventional diaconate of six members, and the church quickly became independent from the Cliftonville Congregational Church (although close links were maintained). The new church had its own schoolroom, which enabled the Sunday school to grow significantly: by 1939 there were 98 members, and the roll increased further when Hangleton received wartime evacuees from London and elsewhere. A church hall was built in 1951. Financial difficulties during World War II were overcome with the help of grants from the Sussex Congregational Union and the Congregational Central Fund, and the church was debt-free by July 1947. The congregation then began to raise money to build a church hall; the ¬£500 cost was met in May 1948, and construction work started on a site to the east of the church. Work was completed in 1951; John Leopold Denman was again responsible for the design. Having its own hall enabled the church's many groups and organisations to thrive: in 1938 a Women's Fellowship was formed, followed by the Girls' Brigade (1939; still extant), Boys' Brigade (1941; disbanded in the 1990s), Life Boy Team (1941), Young People's Fellowship (1943), and a Men's Fireside Group (1944). After observing \\"Junior Churches\\" set up for children at the Clermont Congregational Church in Preston Village and another church in Beckenham, members of the congregation set one up in 1944. The hall also served as Hangleton's original community centre and library: the suburb did not get a purpose-built library until 1962. Other innovations included \\"Dramatic Services\\" (worship in the form of plays) from 1945 onwards‚Äîthese attracted interest from across Brighton and Hove and further afield‚Äîand screenings of religious films. The church bought a Kawai grand piano with money left as a bequest. In April 1990, Tony Bennett was due to perform a concert at the Brighton Dome. During his warm-up, he broke the venue's piano, putting the show in jeopardy. An employee who looked after the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra's pianos when they played at the Dome mentioned the Hounsom Memorial Church's instrument‚Äîand it was brought to the Dome in time for Bennett's performance. Along with most Congregational and Presbyterian churches in England, Hounsom Memorial Church became part of the United Reformed Church in 1972. It is designated as a \\"local congregation\\" of that denomination. As of , it is one of six belonging to that denomination in the city of Brighton and Hove. As well as the former Cliftonville Congregational Church (now styled the Central United Reformed Church), the others are at North Road in central Brighton (Brighthelm Church and Community Centre), Lewes Road, Portslade and Saltdean (St Martin's Church). Proposals to change the name of the church to St Christopher's Church, referring to the bas-relief depiction of that saint on the front of the building, were put forward in the 1950s but were not acted upon. The church is licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and has the registration number 58318. Architecture Saint Christopher is represented in bas-relief form at the top of the tower. The brief given to John Leopold Denman by the founders was specific: the new church had to be \\"...unlike a 15th-century church or a Nonconformist chapel or a cinema, but [instead] a modern type of building in keeping with the area\\". His design has elements of the Vernacular and his favoured Neo-Georgian style, with some elements of Modernism. The 350-capacity church has a single internal space measuring lit by small clerestory windows at the top of the aisles. The walls are of \\"mottled\\" red brick made at the Ringmer brickworks in East Sussex; the red roof tiles were also produced there. A stubby tower topped with a shallow pantile-covered spire stands at the north end; this has three \\"startling\\" bas- relief representations of Saint Christopher, a pelican and a lamb‚Äîthe latter two representing sacrifice and the Lamb of God. Such allegorical depictions are unusual for a Nonconformist church.

Origins The Seminar was the brainchild of Margaret Knox Goggin, on the faculty (and formerly dean) of the School of Librarianship at the University of Denver. The first session, held at the University in December 1977, was primarily intended for librarians who wished to improve their skills in buying used, out-of- print, and rare books.AB Bookman's Weekly, June 23, 1980, p. 4886. Twenty-five registrants heard lectures by Goggin, Jacob L. Chernofsky (Editor and Publisher of AB Bookman's Weekly), Lee Ash, and Harry U. Mooney (Collection Development Coordinator, Denver Public Library). The success of the venture encouraged Goggin and Chernofsky to offer an annual seminar beginning in 1979 on the out-of-print and antiquarian book market, \\"designed to help librarians throughout the country with a working knowledge of the out-of-print and antiquarian book trade and the role of that market in acquisitions procedures and collection development.\\" AB Bookman's Weekly, June 18, 1980, p. 4664. Nearly 50 students attended the 1979 Seminar, which was oriented toward the needs of librarians; nevertheless, \\"a half dozen booksellers also registered ‚Äî pointing up the need for such a course for booksellers as well as librarians.‚Äù AB Bookman's Weekly, June 23, 1980 p. 4886. Faculty members at the 1979 Seminar included the autograph dealer Mary A. Benjamin, Franklin Gilliam (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco), Edwin V. Glaser (a dealer specializing in rare medical books, based in Sausalito, CA), Katharine Kyes Leab (Editor of American Book Prices Current), Murray S. Martin (Penn State), Bernard M. Rosenthal (a San Francisco-based dealer specializing in early printed books), and Florian Shasky (Stanford University Libraries). Early years The Seminar became an annual event held in August at the University of Denver under the co-directorship of Goggin and Chernofsky, its title settling down as \\"A Workshop-Seminar on the Out-of-Print and Antiquarian Book Market for Booksellers and Librarians,\\" designed \\"to meet the needs of acquisitions librarians, those responsible for developing collections, rare book librarians, as well as booksellers and prospective booksellers.\\".AB Bookman's Weekly, 23 June 1980, pp. 4886-89; July 7, 1980, p. 5 The Seminar lecturers varied somewhat from year to year, but a core faculty emerged that included, besides Jake Chernofsky and Margaret Goggin, Michael Ginsberg (an Americana dealer based in Sharon, MA), Ed Glaser, Robert W. Topp (Hermitage Book Shop, Denver), and Jake Zeitlin (Zeitlin & Ver Brugge, Los Angeles). Other stalwart faculty members were to include Mary Francis Ciletti, Lois Harvey, Jennifer Larson, Jean Parmer, and Richard Weatherford. Though there were always a few librarians in attendance, by the mid-1980s, the typical Seminar student was a used, out-of-print, or rare bookseller (or someone who wished to become one). Success The Seminar was soon attracting over 100 registrants annually. It ran extra sessions at the University of Florida in March 1988 and March 1994, in addition to the annual sessions in Colorado each August. Its success was chronicled in a series of annual articles by AB Bookman's Weekly's Associate Editor, Rebecca Myers, often titled with some variant of \\"Book is a four- letter word.\\"\\"Antiquarian Book Seminar Entering Its 2nd Decade,\\" May 29, 1989, pp. 2397-2402; \\"Antiquarian Book Seminar Launches Second Decade,\\" May 28, 1990; \\"Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book,\\" June 24, 1991, pp. 2619-24 and May 11, 1992, 1929-32; \\"Sharing the Fingerspitzengefuehl,\\" May 17, 1993, pp. 2091-94; \\"Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book,\\" May 16, 1994, pp. 2155-58 and Jan 9, 1995, pp. 9=-98. Beginning in 1985, a keynote speaker began the proceedings on Sunday night. Notable keynoters included John Y. Cole (1985; Center for the Book, Library of Congress); Marcus A. McCorison (1987; Director and Librarian, American Antiquarian Society); Robert Rosenthal (1989; head of special collections, University of Chicago); and Louis Weinstein (1999; Heritage Book Shop, Los Angeles). By the late 1980s, the Seminar had established a tradition of asking a different specialist dealer to join the faculty each year: Diane deBlois in 1988 (aGatherin', Wynanskill, NY; printed ephemera); Patterson Smith in 1990 (Montclair, NJ; true crime); John Crichton in 1991 (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco: literature); Priscilla Juvelis in 1996 (Boston; artists' books); and so on. Transition Years Margaret Knox Goggin stepped down as co-director of the Seminar after the 1994 Gainesville and Colorado Seminars, and the Denver connection weakened. The 1993 Seminar was hosted by the Colorado School of Mines in Golden; in 1995 the Seminar moved to Colorado College, in Colorado Springs, Colorado (where it has been, ever since). Chernofsky continued as director, with Jennifer Larson as unnamed co-director; but in the later 1990s his magazine, AB Bookman's Weekly, was faltering, unable to cope with the rise of internet bookselling; AB ceased publication in 1999, and Chernofsky sold the Seminar to faculty members Michael Ginsberg, Edwin Glaser, Lois Harvey, and Jennifer Larson (later, Daniel De Simone and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. jointly purchased a 1/5 share of the Seminar from the other shareholders). The Seminar was slow to refocus its presentations on what students most wanted to learn: more about researching and pricing used general-interest books; more about selling on eBay and the internet; less about older and more valuable antiquarian books. Attendance declined; by 2004, the average number of participants had fallen to well under 50. CABS Becomes a 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Corporation The Seminar reinvigorated itself in the mid-2000s, with faculty additions Terry Belanger, Thomas E. Congalton (Between the Covers Rare Books, Gloucester City, NJ), Daniel De Simone (Rosenwald Curator, Library of Congress), internet specialist Dan Gregory (Between the Covers), Kevin Royal Johnson (Royal Books, Baltimore), and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. (Rulon-Miller Books, St Paul, MN) joining Seminar stalwarts Ginsberg and Glaser. Participant response was enthusiastic,See, for example, comments by Kenny Parolini, https://web.archive.org/web/20080704124325/http://ioba.org/newsletter/archive/7%282%29/toolbox2.php, accessed 2011-11-01; by Maria Hutchison, http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2007/08/08/update-from-the-colorado- antiquarian-book-seminar, accessed 2011-11-01; and by Joel Perlman (in the newsletter of the Independent Online Booksellers Association, http://ioba.org/standard/2011/06/2009-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar-cabs- journal-or-teaching-an-old-dog-some-new-tricks/, accessed 2011-09-18. and attendance began to climb. The Seminar's title was given its present form: Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar (CABS) and a new website, and the proprietors relinquished their shares to a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation called the Antiquarian Book School Foundation. The current director of CABS is Rob Rulon-Miller and the current local coordinator at Colorado College is Kathy Lindeman; the chairman of the Foundation's board is Rob Rulon-Miller. The ongoing faculty comprises bookseller Lorne W. Bair (Winchester, VA); Terry Belanger (Charlottesville, VA); Brian Cassidy (Silver Spring, MD), Maria Lin (Saint Paul, MN); Katherine Reagan (Curator ofRare Books and Manuscripts, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), Rob Rulon-Miller (Saint Paul, MN) and Garrett Scott (Ann Arbor, MI). Since 1980, nearly 3,000 persons have attended the Seminar, which throughout its existence has had the strong support of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America (ABAA): CABS board and faculty members over the years have included ABAA Presidents Thomas E. Congalton, Edwin V. Glaser, Michael Ginsberg, Bernard M. Rosenthal, Robert Rulon-Miller Jr, John Thomson, and others. In recent years, scholarships to CABS have been provided not only by ABAA (Woodburn Scholarships) but also by AbeBooks, Biblio.com, Bibliopolis, IOBA Independent Online Booksellers Association, and the Rocky Mountain Antiquarian Booksellers Association (RMABA) as well as by the faculty themselves. Most of the current attendees are booksellers (or prospective booksellers), but librarians and book collectors sometimes attend, as well. Now in its 40th year, the Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar is the oldest, continuously operated educational institution in the world for the antiquarian book trade, predating Rare Book School in Virginia, which was partially modeled on the Colorado Seminar, by nearly five years. Of the nearly 3,000 or so graduates of the Seminar, a remarkably high percentage of them are still involved in books, either as booksellers, librarians, and/or collectors.

Knapp: China's living houses: folk beliefs, symbols, and household ornamentation, University of Hawaii Press, 1999, pp. 68-70 and could be richly decorated. Common decorations include symbols of good luck, such as the character for good fortune (). Particularly ornate spirit screens featuring a dragon motif are the Nine-Dragon Walls that can be found in imperial palaces and gardens. Spirit screens are tied to the belief that evil spirits () cannot move around corners, hence the spirit screen blocks them from entering through the gate they shield.Jeanne Boden: The Wall Behind China's Open Door: Towards Efficient Intercultural Management in China, Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2008, pg. 17 Practically, they allow natural light and air circulation to enter a room, while obstructing vision.

Archaeological evidence has established the existence of spirit screens back to the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046‚Äì771 BCE).Women of China, Foreign Language Press, 2007, p. 43 During the times of the Western Zhou, spirit screens were a privilege reserved for palaces and the mansions of noblemen such as dukes or princes.

Life Joseph Drew was born in Deptford, son of Joseph Drew (1779‚Äì1846) of the Royal Navy dockyard service and Martha Gale (1781‚Äì1854). The family probably came to London from Dorset shortly before Joseph was born, as his elder siblings Sarah and Henry had been baptised in Wyke Regis. Following the shutting down of Deptford Dockyard in 1830, his family moved to Melcombe Regis where he worked in his father's confectionery business. He later started a grocery business (with a partner Joseph Maunders) which went bankrupt. In about 1838 he moved to Guernsey with his wife and their four young children and set up his own confectioners in St. Peter Port, but returned to Weymouth a few years later. Drew founded the newspaper The Southern Times, published in Weymouth in 1850, which he edited until 1862.Attwooll, p.50 For most of his life he was active in local affairs, becoming a JP and town councillor. In 1852, by reason of his wealth and influence as a newspaper proprietor, Joseph Drew became a partner in the company Cosens & Co. which operated paddle steamers from Weymouth. He became chairman of Cosens in 1874.Clammer p.29 et seq. A print after the Zuccari portrait of Shakespeare Drew was, from 1854, proprietor of the Victoria HotelBradshaw's Guide, 1861 (at Augusta Place on Weymouth Esplanade), where in 1857 he opened a refreshment room and art gallery (the Great Western Picture Saloon) displaying his valuable collection of works 'by the great Masters and modern artists'.Jeffrey's Illustrated Weymouth Guide, 3rd ed., 1861 Drew's collection included 'the equestrian Vandyke' (sic); and there were pencil sketches by Turner, Rembrandt, Rubens, Paolo Veronese, Andrea del Sarto and Titian. Mentioned is 'Dana√´ and her golden shower'. There were also paintings by Sir David Wilkie, Danby, Niemann, Webster and Wilson. Joseph Drew sold, from his collection, Nicholas Poussin's The Testament of EudamidasWikiart: Poussin's The Testament of Eudamidas to the Rev.

Thomas Mawkes was the son of watch and clock maker Thomas Mawkes of Derby for ¬£2000.Dorsetshire County Chronicle and Somersetshire Gazette, 30 April 1857 In 1859 it was reported that he had purchased a portrait of Shakespeare by 'Zucchero'.Dorsetshire County Chronicle and Somersetshire Gazette, 20 October 1859 Drew's wide knowledge of art and his concern for it is shown in his 1871 address to the British Archaeological Association, Art Treasures and their Preservation, published fully in his Synopsis of Fourteen Popular Lectures. Joseph Drew died at Weymouth in 1883 and was buried in Melcombe Regis Cemetery. There is a memorial to him, his wife and two children near the west wall of the cemetery. Works Drew wrote and lectured on a wide range of subjects in the fields of art, science, history and religion. In 1851 he strongly criticised Pope Pius IX with an essay Popery against the Pope, an Appeal to Protestants and satirical verse The Vision of the Pope; or A Snooze in the Vatican. These works were prompted by the re-establishment of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850, when the pope created 12 Catholic dioceses in England and appointed diocesan bishops. Between 1866 and 1872 he delivered a series of free lectures which he described in A Synopsis of Fourteen Popular Lectures. In 1871 he gave a lecture to the British Arch√¶ological Association on Art Treasures and their Preservation. He ventured into historical fiction with his short novel The Poisoned Cup, published in many editions between 1876 and 1962. His last written work, The Rival Queens, factually written in a popular style, is an account of the eventful but troubled life of Mary Queen of Scots, and her unhappy fate in the hands of her English cousin Queen Elizabeth.  Family  Fiat justitia ruat c≈ìlum When he was only 18 Joseph Drew married Eliza Monday (1808‚Äì1846), six years his senior, at St Bride's Church, Fleet St, London. They had four children: Mary Jessie Drew (1833‚Äì1872), Joseph William Drew (1834‚Äì1859), Alice Martha Drew (1836‚Äì1897) and Fanny Eliza Drew (1839‚Äì1871, maternal grandmother of Agnes Humbert). His wife died at the age of 38, and two years later he married her younger sister Caroline Agnes Monday (1820‚Äì1893), a school teacher, at St Mary Magdalen Bermondsey, by whom he had two children Caroline Agnes Drew (1850‚Äì1933) and musician Harry Drew (1851‚Äì1895).Harry Drew was a teacher and organist at St. Thomas' College then at Mutwal, Colombo, CeylonFree scores by Harry Drew at the International Music Score Library Project Drew's daughter Fanny Eliza married organist William James Rooke and their daughter Mabel Wells Annie Rooke was the mother of the heroine of the French Resistance Agn√®s Humbert.

Research areas  Research at CeSOS focuses on the creation of fundamental knowledge about the design and operation of future ships and ocean structures, using analytical, numerical and experimental studies. The centre has furthermore made it its responsibility to integrate marine hydrodynamics, structural mechanics and automatic control in its research.Det Norske Veritas (19.06.2006): Maritime research finds new applications, 42-44 The knowledge that is being produced by this kind of research is vital, both now and in the future, for the design of safe, cost effective and environmentally friendly structures as well as in the planning and execution of marine operations.NTNU (2011): Olje og gass, sentre, 3-5 The importance of such work cannot be over-emphasised: In tonnage terms, 95 per cent of all international transport is by sea, and 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs oil and gas is produced from subsea reservoirs via offshore structures and pipelines. In the future, food production in aquacultural plants and the exploitation of renewable energy from the oceans is expected to play a growing role.

In 1990-1996 Count Raven released four studio albums, then broke up in 1998. In 2003 the band reunited and in 2009 released their fifth album, Mammons War. Band history The band, formed in 1987 by vocalist Christian Linderson, guitarist Dan Fondelius, bassist Tommy Eriksson and drummer Christer Pettersson, was called originally Stormvarning. In 1989 they changed their name to Count Raven. A year later, the group released its first album, Storm Warning, for the Hellhound label, which received positive reviews from the European metal press (4 K's in Kerrang!, 10/10 in Rock Hard, 6/7 in Metal Hammer) Then Linderson left to join Saint Vitus (in 2007 he became the member of Lord Vicar), and Fondelius became the frontman, beginning with 1992's Destruction of the Void, released by Nuclear Blast Records to be declared 'Doom Album of the Year' by Rock Hard magazine. Third album High on Infinity appeared one year later, after which the band took a three-year break before returning in 1996 with Messiah of Confusion which dealt with the band's outlook on society and its dubious ways. \\"The album's name is our bass player's nickname, but when the album began to see the light of day, we thought the title was a good idea. There's a lot of 'messiahs of confusion' out there\\", drummer Pettersson explained. In 1998 Count Raven broke up. Fondelius formed a new doom metal band Doomsday Government, Eriksson joined Semlah in 2001. In 2003 the trio reformed, broke up again in 2006 and revived instantly with Fondelius at the helm, Fredrik Jansson (ex-Abramis Brama) on bass and Jens Bock on drums. In 2009 Count Raven's fifth album Mammons War produced by Zeb King and released by I Hate came out, \\"a killer rebirth\\", \\"timeless\\" and living up \\"to this outfit's reputation as doom metallers par exellence\\", according to Kerrang! which gave it a 4K rating.Olly Thomas.

XiaoQing is about to get married with her boyfriend of 10 years,Jiang Cheng. She had been working very hard to save money to buy her own house. But Jiang Cheng not only hung around everyday, but was also cheated and lent all of XiaoQing's saving to an unreliable friend. XiaoQing was too angry to leave Jiang Cheng and felt desperate to keep their love alive. She applied for many credit cards and dressed herself like a high- class lady so that she could get a rich man to marry her. On the other side, Xiaohong has been in love with her boss for 10 years; waiting ruined all her hope for love. She decided to evaluate men according to their credit cards. Then she met Zhang Quan who could shop without limits. She believes the reason she made friends with Zhang Quan is solely because she loves his money. But is this really true?

The band has had a long career with numerous lineup changes, all centered on vocalist Hikage. Biography The Star Club was the first punk band in Nagoya, when they formed in April 1977. Their first release was a live 7-inch vinyl record in 1978 which was \\"heavily English influenced punk with a rock and roll edge\\". Into the early 1980s, the band went through several lineup changes while releasing a string of singles, gradually increasing in popularity, with singer Hikage becoming an icon of Japanese punk. The group released their first full-length album in 1983, the live Hot & Cool. By 1984, the group was topping the independent charts, and signed to the independent Tokuma label, with whom they released the LPs Hello New Punks in 1984 and \\"Punk! Punk! Punk!\\" in 1985. The records sold well, and the band was signed to the major label Victor. The band has been productive over the years, releasing an album of new material every year or so, sometimes dabbling in hardcore punk, sometimes returning to their punk rock roots. The Star Club is still active today, with Hikage as the sole remaining original member.

All 231 aboard survived without serious injuries. A leak in one of the aircraft's hydraulic systems occurred shortly after takeoff, resulting in the loss of all of the hydraulic fluid supplying the primary landing gear system. History of the flight LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16 was scheduled to arrive at Warsaw Chopin Airport from Newark Liberty International Airport on 1 November 2011 at 13:35 CET with 220 passengers and 11 crew on board. The aircraft operating the service was a Boeing 767-35DER, registered SP-LPC, named Pozna≈Ñ, serial number 28656. It was first delivered to LOT in 1997. Within 30 minutes of departing from Newark, the crew received a warning that the center hydraulic system had malfunctioned. The decision was made to continue to Warsaw in order to use up the heavy load of fuel needed for the transatlantic flight. The aircraft proceeded to approach as normal, but aborted when the landing gear failed to deploy. The crew informed Warsaw air traffic control (ATC) that they were unable to lower the landing gear due to a hydraulic system failure. The captain decided to circle the airport for over an hour, to consume excess fuel and to allow time for ground emergency services to prepare for the landing. Visual observation by two Polish Air Force F-16 fighter jets verified that none of the landing gear were down; attempts to lower the landing gear by alternative means failed. =Preparation for landing= The airport was evacuated for the arrival of the aircraft, and roads around the airport were closed to accommodate emergency services. Other flights which were due into Warsaw were diverted or returned to their point of departure. At 14:40 CET the crew made a successful gear-up landing on Runway 33, with no injuries to anyone. The aircraft however, sustained substantial damage, resulting in a hull loss. All of those on board were evacuated within 90 seconds. The airport remained closed to traffic until 16:00 CET, 3 November 2011, to enable removal of crash debris and then a final inspection of runways and aprons. Shortly after the evacuation, a team from the Polish State Commission on Aircraft Accidents Investigation (SCAAI) arrived, and discovered that the C829 circuit breaker, which protects a number of systems including the alternate landing gear extension system was \\"popped\\". The C4248 breaker for the alternate landing gear remained closed. After the plane was lifted off the runway, the C829 circuit breaker was closed, and the landing gear was extended, using the alternate system. The plane was then towed to the LOT maintenance hangar, for further investigation. Flight crew Tadeusz Wrona in 2012 The captain of flight 16 was Tadeusz Wrona, a 57-year-old veteran pilot with twenty years of experience on the 767. Both the captain and first officer Jerzy Szwarc held Airline Transport Pilot Licenses, accumulating over 25,000 hours of flying time between them, of which 15,000 were on 767 aircraft. Investigation The preliminary report by the SCAAI found that a hydraulic leak occurred shortly after takeoff, after the landing gear and flaps were retracted.Preliminary report. 30 November 2011 The leak was from a flexible hose in the center hydraulic system, resulting in the loss of all fluid in that system. The drop in pressure was indicated by the EICAS and recorded by the flight data recorder. Later investigation indicated a popped circuit breaker just to the right of the F/O at floor level would have enabled the electric motor for releasing the undercarriage. The breaker was reset after landing and the undercarriage extended normally. The final report of the accident was released in 2017. The causes of the accident were the center hydraulic hose leak, the popped circuit breaker, and pilot error due to the flight crew failing to detect the breaker. Aftermath Polish President Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski praised the crew and thanked them for their successful landing. The Boeing 767, registration SP-LPC, was damaged extensively to the point that LOT deemed the aircraft a hull loss.Boeing 767 SP-LPC zostanie sprzedany ‚Äì Press information The accident represents the 14th hull loss of a Boeing 767. Two years after the incident, in November of 2013, the aircraft was scrapped. As of February 2020, the flight is operated by Airbus A340 and Boeing 787 of Air Belgium and LOT Polish Airlines respectively. The airline ended its Boeing 767 service by 2013 and was replaced by the Boeing 787.

The park's centerpiece is the Hehuachi, or Lotus Pond. Hehuachi Park's history can be traced back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The park plays an important role in the daily life of Yangzhou people, providing a quiet environment for people's recreation. The park is open to visitors free of charge.  Introduction  A night view of the Hehua Pond Hehuachi Park is located at the southwestern corner of Yangzhou's historic center (formerly, the walled city). The park occupies an area of 11 ha, including 5 ha of water.ÂÖ¨Âõ≠Âª∫ËÆæËøΩÊ±Ç\\"ÁâπËâ≤\\"--Êâ¨Â∑ûËç∑Ëä±Ê±†ÂÖ¨Âõ≠Âú®Ëç∑Ëä±‰∏äÂ§ßÂÅöÊñáÁ´† Hehuachi is part of Yangzhou's intricate network of lakes and canals. The Erdaohe () Canal, running along the western edge of Yangzhou's old city, comes to the Hehua Pond from the north, connecting it with the Thin West Lake at the city's northwest. The short (300-meter long) Erdaogou () Canal runs east from the Hehua Pond, linking it with the nearby old channel of the Grand Canal of China, which forms the old city's southern and eastern borders.Âè§ËøêÊ≤≥‚ÄîËç∑Ëä±Ê±†‚ÄîÁò¶Ë•øÊπñÊ∞¥‰∏äÊ∏∏ËßàÁ∫øÂÖ®ÈÉ®Ë¥ØÈÄö (The Old Grand Canal - Hehua Pond - Thin West Lake tourist waterway is fully open), 2010-09-20 It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.ÁªøÊù®ÂüéÈÉ≠Ê∞¥‰∏äÊ∏∏4¬∑18‰∫ÆÁõ∏ , 2011-3-29; see the map in this article The park is a combination of modern style and the traditional style as a park in the city. It was regarded as the second rank garden of Jiangsu for the first batch. Its original names are Nanchi and Yanchi. Because there are many lotuses planted in the pond, then it was renamed as Hehuachi park. Hehuachi is one of the most eight famous scenic garden spots of Yangzhou. The scenes where the garden overlooks Inkslab Pool with Wenfeng tower on the other side, is titled of \\"Yanchi Ranhan\\".  History  In a quiet corner of the park The owner of the Garden brought in many precious rocks from lake Taihu in the past, some of those rocks were very big, and others were quite small. It is said that those rocks were the remains of the Huashi Gang of the Song dynasty. The owner placed those beautiful rocks together as man-made hills to decorate the Garden. With those rare artificial hills, the park took on a fantastic view. Additionally, the whole park were surrounded by different kinds of green trees. Inside the park, there were several flower houses built. A great variety of flowers were planted in those houses and they bloomed throughout the seasons. The whole park is filled with sweet fragrance . In spring, the rhododendron, the camellia and the jasmine were planted in the flower house; in summer, the broad-leaved epiphyllum, the lotus and the oleander, and so on, were planted in it; in autumn, the sweet-scented osmanthus and the chrysanthemum were cultivated in the flower rooms, besides the wintersweet and cypress which were cold-resistant were cultivated in winter. Inside the flower house were arranged small artificial hills, with a pool next to them, and springs would trickle down from the hills. It took on lively pictures. However, in the late Ming dynasty and early Qing dynasty, the park has Ying garden and Jiufeng garden. After the war, it was badly destroyed. At the beginning of the 1990s, the main problems of Hehua pond park surroundings are \\"dirty, disorder, low and wet\\".  Reconstruction  In order to improve the environment, the city government decided to use the advantages of the Hehua pond's topography for the construction of the whole park. In 1981, the water park was being built at the north of Hehua pond, namely Hehuachi Park. A few years later, the classical styles of garden group, such as Yanchi Ranhan and Jiufeng Stone, together with the revetments of Hehua pond and outdoor swimming pool were finished. It looked like a half-bird. In 1997, the park was completely opened to the public. The reconstruction of park changed greatly to the southwest appearance of the city. The park has become an ideal place for leisure, entertainment and exercise site for people there.

History  Hitchin Museum was founded in 1939 by the Hitchin & District Regional Survey Association in a house given by Ralph & Hubert Moss, grocers in the town. The house, formerly known as AgadirFoster, A M 1981 The Book of Hitchin. Barracuda, p 40 and subsequently as Charnwood, was built in 1825 and has a south front dating from c 1840. The building opened in 1939 as a Public Library and in 1941 the top floor opened as a Museum. The Library, run by Hertfordshire County Council since the late 1960s, is now in an extension next door. Although it was initially run by Hitchin Urban District Council, since its dissolution in 1974, the Museum has been run by North Hertfordshire District Council, together with Letchworth Museum and Art Gallery and, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Royston Museum and the First Garden City Heritage Museum. = Closure = In 2004-5, North Hertfordshire District Council undertook a Fundamental Service Review of its Museum Service.North Hertfordshire District Council: Art, Museums and Heritage Forum , retrieved 2 November 2011 Although it found that visitors greatly valued all aspects of the service (Hitchin Museum & Art Gallery, Letchworth Museum & Art Gallery, the Education Service with its School Loans scheme, the Archaeology and the Natural History Services), the two museums were both described as unfit for purpose and the Museums Resource Centre at Burymead Road in Hitchin as outdated and inefficient. The Review had five main recommendations, one of which was to close the two existing museums at Letchworth Garden City and at Hitchin, and instead run a museum and gallery on a single town-centre site. A Feasibility Study was commissioned to investigate the possibility of converting Hitchin Town Hall to museum use. Hitchin Museum closed to the public on 1 September 2012, and the town hall site was opened as the North Hertfordshire Museum in 2019.

Smith (born 1938 in Tipton, Indiana) is an American artist and author. He has taught at the Visual Studies Workshop, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and the University of Illinois. He is a recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships, a National Endowment of the Arts grant and a Pollock- Krasner Foundation grant. Smith creates books as works of art, as well as instructional texts on how to make books. Permanent collections which hold works by Smith include the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Canada, and the Center for Creative Photography. Education and teaching Following military service in Vietnam where Smith was a chaplain's assistant for the US Army, Smith attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1963 to 1967. He received a master's degree in Photography in 1968 from the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1971, Smith returned to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago to teach in the printmaking and photography departments at the invitation of Ken Josephson. While continuing to teach, in 1974 Smith became an adjunct faculty member at Visual Studies Workshop, founded by curator and artist Nathan Lyons. Early recognition and exhibitions Keith Smith first met the artist and curator Nathan Lyons while in his second year at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Lyons, then head of exhibitions at George Eastman House, included work by Smith in the exhibition ‚ÄúSeeing Photographically‚Äù in October 1966. Also in 1966, Smith met John Szarkowski at New York's Museum of Modern Art. Szarkowski was impressed by the young artist and purchased a photograph and photo-etching for the Museum's collection. Smith was included in several group exhibitions at the Museum in the early 1970s: ‚ÄúPhotography: New Acquisitions‚Äù in 1970, and ‚ÄúUnique/Multiple: Sculpture/Photographs‚Äù in 1973. Smith's first solo exhibition ‚ÄúPhotographs by Keith Smith‚Äù was held at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1968, while Smith was still a student at the School there. The show was organized by the Institute's Curator of Prints and Drawings, Hugh Edwards. In 1974, Keith Smith and Sonia Landy Sheridan collaborated on work using the 3M Color-in-Color process to reproduce the human form for the Museum of Modern Art's ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù series, which reported on recent developments in art. The pair collaborated on nine new works for the show, including three extremely large pieces up to 47 feet in length. The largest work, a nude figure, was constructed entirely of copies of 8 ¬Ω x 11 inch prints of sections of the model's body enlarged and transferred to fabric. Smith's 1966 photo-etching titled ‚ÄúFigure in a Landscape‚Äù was included in the landmark 1978 exhibition ‚ÄúMirrors and Windows: American Photography since 1960‚Äù at the Museum of Modern Art. Curated by John Szarkowski, head of the Department of Photography, the show and accompanying catalogue featured the work of artists such as Diane Arbus, William Eggleston, Elliott Erwitt, Lee Friedlander, Stephen Shore, Ed Ruscha, Robert Rauschenberg and Garry Winogrand, among others. Artistic practice and bookmaking Keith Smith is primarily known for his bookmaking, both as an artist and as a teacher. In addition, Smith is a printmaker, draftsman and photographer. His artwork and books are often unconventional in form, incorporating stitching, cutouts, holes and string, along with text, collage, drawings and prints. In Book 95 ‚ÄúStructure of the Visual Book,‚Äù Smith said ‚ÄúAll living things are in change. The finished book is a corpse. The observer views the remains, but the bookmaker has known the book while it was living and has seen many possibilities not told.‚Äù To date, Smith has created over 280 books, including textbooks on bookmaking theory and techniques, poetry books, and unique artist's books, categorized by the artist as 1-picture books, no-picture books and conceptual books. Smith emphasizes the ‚Äúbook experience‚Äù as the interaction the viewer has with the art object; viewing a book is a time-based experience that changes as the viewer moves through the sequence of the book by turning pages. Book Number 1 Smith created his first book in 1967 while still a student at Art Institute of Chicago. ‚ÄúBook 1‚Äù is one-of-a-kind, with 32 photo-etchings and cased-in codex. The images in the book came from photographs Smith took during his commutes on buses and trains in the Chicago area, influenced by the subway photographs of Walker Evans. Book Number 200 ‚ÄúBook 200‚Äù was written by the artist as an annotated bibliography documenting his previous 199 books. ‚ÄúBook 200‚Äù includes many examples from one-of-a-kind books that may not be seen elsewhere (other than the original), along with illustrations and photographs from the whole of Smith's bookmaking practice to that date. Textbooks Smith has written eight books on book theory and bookmaking techniques: Structure of the Visual Book; Text in the Book Format; Bookbinding for Book Artists; five volumes of Non-Adhesive Binding: Books without Paste or Glue; 1- 2- & 3-Section Sewings; Exposed Spine Sewings; Smith's Sewing Single Sheets; and Quick Leather Bindings. These books are standard texts for book artists. Recent exhibitions Bruce Silverstein Gallery, New York, presented a solo exhibition by Smith titled ‚ÄúBook by Book‚Äù in 2011. A second exhibition at the gallery in 2013 presented Smith's early photo-based works alongside prints and collages. In 2014, Smith's exhibition ‚ÄúBook by Book: 2nd Edition‚Äù was presented at the Printed Matter NY Art Book Fair at MoMA PS1. His work was also included in the Morgan Library's exhibition \\"A Collective Invention: Photographs at Play\\". In 2018, the retrospective exhibition Keith Smith at Home was organized by the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Lex and Terry is Based in Dallas, Texas, the show is distributed by United Stations Radio Networks. It is heard during weekdays on radio stations throughout the US. The current Lex and Terry team consists of show hosts Lex Staley and Terry Jaymes, plus longtime staff member Dee Reed as executive producer/air talent, and Sarah B. Morgan.  History  Prior to the show, Jaymes gained popularity as an actor on Santa Barbara and also as a stand up comedian, including on the Fox network on the critically acclaimed The Sunday Comics. Jaymes also hosted mornings at KTYD in Santa Barbara and was a member of the Blaze and Bob morning show on KOME \\"the kome spot on your dial\\". Staley was on his second tour as program director at WFYV-FM \\"Rock 105\\" in Jacksonville, Florida, where he brought Jaymes to join him to do mornings in 1992. Staley had met Jaymes in California earlier and promised if he was ever in charge of a radio station again, Jaymes would be his first and only choice to host mornings. Staley had enjoyed a successful first stint as a program director in the mid '80s at WFYV before he left for a four-year stint at the Album Network in Los Angeles as VP of Syndication for World Premiere events for major music acts, such as Robert Plant, Guns N' Roses, Bruce Springsteen, Van Halen, and John Mellencamp. He said his coolest moment was as co-producer alongside soon to be world renown producer Brenden O'Brien at The Black Crowes Live at the Greek Theatre in the summer of 1992. Staley was also the executive producer for the weekly syndicated show hosted by Redbeard called In the Studio. Years later, Staley and Jaymes would be working on a daily basis with Redbeard at KTXQ \\"Q 102\\" in Dallas. On December 16, 1992, Staley and Jaymes began collaborating in the morning on WFYV. The first show was a whirlwind of controversy in and out of the building as the phones exploded concerning Ross Jeffries, the author of How To Get The Women You Desire Into Bed. His interaction with WFYV's new morning duo was unlike anything the city had ever experienced. It was so uncomfortable for management that Staley was asked to put Jaymes on a plane back to California if that was what the show was going to be. Unbeknownst that this irreverence would set the tone for years to come, Lex and Terry served notice that things had changed for Jacksonville, WFYV-FM, and its two hosts. The show took a while to succeed; some people did not like the \\"two punks in a locker room\\" attitude. Eventually, Lex and Terry had the number one morning show in Jacksonville, with a mix of frank relationship talk, sports (including Sam Kouvaris of WJXT), and sometimes music from such artists as AC/DC and Danzig. WFYV general manager Mark Schwartz said, \\"Unlike a lot of other morning shows that rely on tired bits and material that's stolen from other radio stations, these guys are 100 percent unique. They don't rely on joke services. They're extraordinarily topical.\\" In 1997, Lex and Terry first went into syndication as the show moved to Dallas, Texas, at KTXQ \\"Q-102\\" and remained on WFYV-FM Rock 105 in Jacksonville. This was the catalyst for the start of the duo's successful syndication career that continues today. In May of that year, Lex and Terry began airing on KTXQ in Dallas. By the end of the year, Lex and Terry were also on WFXH in the Savannah, Georgia, market. Promotion of the show included showing the duo with milk mustaches, a blonde stripper with large breasts between them, and the tagline \\"Got Milk?\\" Peter Welpton of KTXQ called Lex and Terry an \\"affordable major market radio show\\" which gave smaller markets the talent and advantages of a large-market show, along with promotion help, and breaks for news and local information. Celebrity guests included Howie Long, Alan Thicke, Denis Leary, David Lee Roth, Norah Jones, and Bill O'Reilly, as well as porn actress and call-in host Juli Ashton. The \\"Telecom Bill\\" was a huge factor of what happened next for Lex and Terry as broadcasting companies were able to buy many more properties than they were before, and the duo got caught up in a whirlwind of acquisitions that eventually swallowed up their host station KTXQ. Despite the show's positive impact on its ratings, KTXQ changed formats as the result of the station's sale and dropped Lex and Terry on September 1, 1998. A firing story that is still told until this day. Lex and Terry moved their show back to Jacksonville, where it was the top morning show among rock radio stations. By this time, the show could also be heard in Key West and Bluefield, West Virginia. On September 11, Lex and Terry debuted in Augusta, Georgia. Gainesville, Florida, and two other markets also planned to add the show, according to Schwartz. He also said the show would likely be added to other stations of WFYV owner Capstar Broadcasting. = 2005-present = By 2005, Lex and Terry were heard on 22 radio stations, with an XM channel added late in November. Also that year, the show's contract with WFYV owner Cox Radio ended, and Staley and Jaymes signed with Clear Channel Communications, hoping to promote the show. A reason for the change was that Cox Radio would not allow the show to run on stations that competed with its stations while Clear Channel would. Despite being the number one morning show for years in the market the hosts called \\"Freakville\\", Lex and Terry was off WFYV and not heard in Jacksonville until February 2006, returning on Planet Radio 107.3. The show remained on Planet Radio until a format change in 2010. University of Florida radio station WRUF-FM stopped airing the show on Fridays in April 2005 because of a feature called \\"Drunk Bitch Friday\\". Cox Radio decided the station had violated its contract and dropped WRUF as an affiliate. Staley and Jaymes both disagreed with the university's decision, with Staley claiming this action violated the First Amendment. The Federal Communications Commission had never found the feature to be indecent, but the university did not want to appear to condone drinking excessively. On Drunk Bitch Friday, \\"a female participant is chauffeured to the station, drinks to 'a state of inebriation that is entertaining,' and provides commentary and advice to callers.\\" Welpton called the feature, a part of the show for two years at the time, a \\"good educational tool to demonstrate the effects of alcohol, and why drinking responsibly is important.\\" The announcement was made on January 20, 2006, that the feature was being dropped. As a result, WRUF brought back the show. Although Lex and Terry held the number one position among men 18-34 for eight straight Arbitron ratings periods, WRUF changed to country music in October 2010, dropping the show. Active rock WHHZ picked it up on November 29, but dropped the show in mid-2015. In the Dallas radio market, Staley and Jaymes returned to live in Dallas, Texas, and KDGE \\"The Edge\\" became the flagship station for the Lex and Terry radio network. It took less than two years for Lex and Terry to establish ratings dominance in the Metroplex with 18-34 adults in morning drive in the nation's number four market. The move to Dallas was explained by the duo as necessary because the Charlotte's and Nashville's of the world questioned the credibility of Jacksonville, Florida, success as not being a good enough market to roll the dice on the show to be cleared in the larger medium markets. Lex & Terry decided to rip the band aid off and take care of business in a major market to lay that concern to rest. Which as stated earlier, they did. Soon markets like Oklahoma City, Tampa, and more had no reason not to accept the show, in addition to their 2004 Marconi nomination as the best syndicated show. They eventually lost out to The Tom Joyner Show. In 2008, on a trip with the NHL's Dallas Stars, the duo were notified that they were being moved to another signal in Dallas to accommodate the feelings of upper management that they would be better served on the hard-leaning classic rock format of KEGL 97.1, \\"The Eagle\\". This decision did not sit will with the duo, but it was done. After Bain Capital acquired Clear Channel and the station became part of IHeartRadio, Lex and Terry and numerous other shows, in budgeting moves by the company, went without renewed contracts, and eventually, Staley and Jaymes went in business by themselves. The show is now without a flagship station in Dallas. Later that year, United Stations Radio Networks replaced Clear Channel as the show's distributor. = Personnel = Kim McCafferty served as news director from the time the show was in Jacksonville but left in April 2007 to return to Florida. Scott Richards was producer of Lex and Terry until November 2008, when he also decided to return to Florida. Jason Carr of WZZR in West Palm Beach became executive producer in 2008, eventually replacing Welpton as director of network operations in September 2010. At the end of 2010, Carr also went back to Florida. Devell Reed took on the position of Executive Producer/Air Talent where he remains presently. Ian Gleason, a show regular with the Pub Quiz, was brought in from New York City in January 2012 to serve as the news director following the departure of Welpton and Tyler \\"Taint\\" Baker the previous year. In July, 2019, Gleason was let go due to budgetary reasons and a shift away from news programming. In 2016, longtime phone screener and on-air personality Sarah Morgan left the show to pursue a career in the cruise ship industry and was replaced by Krystina Byford, a Texas native who did promotions for The Ticket in Dallas. Byford left in June 2018 and was replaced by Morgan, who returned as a full-time on-air personality.

He is best known as a vocalist and lyricist, but also played drums and guitar. He was the second drummer for Crime (1976‚Äì77), the original singer for Flipper (1979) and The Sleepers (1977‚Äì81), and vocalist for Toiling Midgets (1981‚Äì83). He has been credited with giving Flipper their band name, although he was fired before they made any recordings. Williams died at the age of 36 on November 21, 1992, of a heroin overdose. Biography Williams was born in Palo Alto, California, on 4 October 1956. His father was Robert Williams, and he had one sister, named Kathie Lee. His father was gay, and according to The Sleepers' guitarist Michael Belfer, his father's homosexuality had a huge impact on Williams, as he was bisexual. He was also known to indulge in substance abuse throughout his life, including speed, LSD and alcohol. In 1976, Williams was the drummer and an early member of Crime (where he was called \\"Ricky Tractor\\"), until he was kicked out in 1977 for his \\"inconsistencies\\" both on his instrument and in his personality. In 1979, he was a founding member of Flipper. He sang vocals, and was the one who named the band, but was fired \\"for being too weird\\" before the band had released any recordings. He was invited that year by Michael Belfer to become the vocalist for The Sleepers, which released one EP, one single and one album before breaking up in 1981. After the breakup of The Sleepers, he joined Toiling Midgets as vocalist from 1981 until 1983. Towards the end of his life, Williams lived with his mother in Mountain View, CA, where they would drink and watch TV all day. His mother was run over and killed, and a year and two months later Williams himself was dead. At the time of his death, he was remastering his recorded work for re- release. He had been suffering from respiratory disease and died in his sleep on November 21, 1992.

Biography K≈çno was a native of Mutsu Province (modern-day Fukushima Prefecture), where his father, Iwamura Hidetoshi, was a samurai in the service of Miharu Domain, who supplemented his 100 koku income through trade in clothes, sake brewing and wholesale of marine products. K≈çno was sent to Edo for studies in Confucianism and was drawn into the sonn≈ç j≈çi movement. During the Boshin War, he fought against his family, whose Miharu Domain remained loyal to the Tokugawa shogunate and which was a member of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. Following the Meiji restoration, he served as an administrator in many locations in northern Japan for the new Meiji government, and became associated with Itagaki Taisuke and the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. With the Satsuma Rebellion, K≈çno resisted attempts to recruit him to the side of Saig≈ç Takamori, but instead joined Itagaki in forming the Aikokusha movement, pushing for the creation of a national assembly. He was one of the founding members of the Jiy≈´t≈ç political party in 1881. He was leader of the Jiy≈´t≈ç in Fukushima Prefecture from 1882‚Äì1883, during the time of the Fukushima Incident, when conservative forces within the government sought to curb the growing power of the Jiy≈´t≈ç through illegal means. K≈çno won a seat in the Lower House of the Diet of Japan in the 1890 General Election, and was subsequently reelected fourteen consecutive times to the same seat through the 1920 General Election . In 1898, he became a member of the Kenseit≈ç. Over the course of his career, he migrated from the Rikken Seiy≈´kai to the Rikken Kokumint≈ç to the Rikken D≈çshikai and finally to the Kenseikai. K≈çno was briefly (for a six-day period) Speaker of the Lower House in December 1903, causing an uproar for calling for the impeachment of Prime Minister Katsura Tar≈ç during his inaugural speech in front of Emperor Meiji. In 1909, he supported the Pan-Asian Movement creating a group dedicated to the liberation of Asia from Western colonialism.

It was the original headquarters of the British garrison in Newfoundland. A second fort, known as Fort George was situated at the east end of the harbour connected by a subterranean passage with Fort William. On the south side of the Narrows, there was a third fortification called the Castle. Garrison headquarters were later moved to Fort Townshend, which was built between 1775-1779. The Fort was demolished in 1881 to make room for a railway yard, the barracks being used as the station. This was demolished in 1910 and urban development now occupies the site. Fort William was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1952. As there are no visible remains, the site is marked by a Historic Sites and Monuments Board plaque located on a retaining wall at the corner of Cavendish Square and Duckworth Street in downtown St. John‚Äôs  Second and Third Anglo-Dutch War  The Second Anglo-Dutch War brought about a renewal of naval warfare with the Dutch Republic and Newfoundland. Meeting little opposition, a Dutch fleet captured St. John's in 1665, burning shipping and property on shore. Still without naval or military defences, the English merchants of St. John's did what they could for their own defence. After the Dutch attack Christopher Martin, a Devon merchant captain, built and maintained defensive batteries, King William‚Äôs Fort, at the entrance to the harbour at his own expense. Martin landed six cannon from his vessel, the Elias Andrews, and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. During the Third Anglo- Dutch War, in 1673 Martin, with fewer than thirty men, successfully defended the harbour from a second Dutch attack and a separate raid by four pirate vessels.  King William's War  The accession of William III and Mary II in 1688 brought about a reversal of British foreign policy, but although war was formally declared with France in 1689, little was achieved to give the English in Newfoundland better security from attack. From the French stronghold of Placentia, the French had been making successful yearly assaults on the English settlements and fishing stations. The winter of 1696-7 brought the most ambitious attempt to date by the French on the English settlements in Newfoundland in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. This force, under the command of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, destroyed all of the English communities on the Southern Shore without serious opposition, but, marching on St. John's, it was engaged. They then withdrew to the small fortification which had been prepared in the city, where they held out for a further 48 hours. They were forced to surrender the town and fort, which was burned to the ground. This signal disaster, and especially the consternation it caused in New England, at last stimulated the British government to provide a permanent defence force for the island. A strong British relief force of 1500 troops reoccupied St. John's in the summer of 1697: they found the town abandoned, pillaged and every building destroyed. That winter, 214 of 300 soldiers perished due to lack of provisions and shelter. The following year construction was begun on a well-engineered fortification - Fort William - which, when completed in 1700, had brick-faced ramparts, bomb-proof parapets, powder magazines and proper barracks.  Queen Anne's War  Peace had been established in 1697, but at the time of the accession of Queen Anne in 1702, war with France was renewed. In January 1705, St. John's was again attacked overland from Placentia. On this occasion, Daniel d'Auger de Subercase, the French commander, had a force of almost 500 regulars, French Canadians and Indians. He took the town, but the Fort William garrison held out and refused terms. After the five-week Siege of St. John's, Subercase retired to Placentia with all the booty his men and several hundred captive townspeople could carry. Sporadic attacks continued throughout 1706, despite British reinforcement of the St. John's garrison. Yet another overland attack on St. John's by St. Ovide de Brouillon in January 1709 (Battle of St. John's), met with complete and immediate success. The British garrison, demoralised and badly led, surrendered the fort after only a brief resistance, and the French, taking upwards of 500 prisoners with them, withdrew to Placentia after destroying all the fortifications around the harbour. The following year the British began rebuilding Fort William and emplaced stronger armament, however, the garrison did not return and the fort began to fall into disrepair. By 1712, British victories in Europe had brought about an armistice and, in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the French yielded all rights in Newfoundland to Britain.  King George's War  Subsequently, the British fortifications in Newfoundland were neglected and fell into decay. Hence a major reconstruction was hastily begun in 1743 in the lead up to war with France. During King George's War (1744‚Äì48) although no military action occurred in Newfoundland itself, the British had maintained a strengthened naval force in the colony as a counter to the fortress then established by the French at Louisbourg in Cape Breton, and Fort William was completely rebuilt by 1749.  The French and Indian War  The final military engagement in Newfoundland occurred in the fall of 1762 and was the final action in the Anglo-French war of 1756-63 known as Battle of Signal Hill. British victories at Louisbourg (1758), Quebec City (1759) and Montreal (1760) virtually eliminated the French presence in North America and led to the opening of peace negotiations under conditions of great disadvantage to France. Desperate to recover a bargaining counter, the French government dispatched a naval force with 800 troops to attack Newfoundland. Following earlier French-Canadian strategy, Comte d'Haussonville, the French commander, marched overland on St. John's from a landing in the undefended harbour at Bay Bulls. The British garrison in Fort William, few in numbers and without well- prepared defences, made no resistance and surrendered on June 17. The British Command in New York quickly organized a counterstroke. By September, 1500 regular and New England troops had been convoyed to the Avalon Peninsula and, on September 13, their commander, Lt. Col. William Amherst, made a landing at Torbay eight miles north of St. John's. Marching overland, Amherst drove the French from their outer defences at Quidi Vidi Pass and on the 15th captured the high ground of Signal Hill in a surprise dawn assault. With the French force now confined to Fort William, Amherst occupied the following two days bringing up heavy guns to reduce the fortifications: meanwhile the French warships which had convoyed d'Haussonville's force and which remained in St. John's harbour, escaped under cover of a thick fog. Amherst's batteries - one on the lower slope of Signal Hill and another north of the Fort on high ground along King's Bridge Road - were ready by the 17th and began an intensive bombardment of Fort William that day. Surrounded and unsupported, d'Haussonville's force capitulated on September 18.Bernard Ransom 1982  Demolition  Fort William was poorly situated and was not able to effectively protect the harbour or the settlement at St. John‚Äôs. Because of its location, it was vulnerable to land attack. Finally, in 1779, the British deemed Fort William to be too susceptible to attack and built Fort Townshend slightly further to the west. Fort William became a minor defence and one part of a larger system of forts and batteries that defended St. John‚Äôs and the harbours of Quidi Vidi and Torbay. In 1881, it was demolished and its site cleared to accommodate the Newfoundland Railway hotel and rail yard.Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, Minutes, 1952, 1953, 2007  References   Bibliography  * A Century of Armed Conflict in Newfoundland By Bernard Ransom Winter 1982 * * National Historic Sites Directorate, Documentation Centre, 5th Floor, Room 89, 25 Eddy Street, Gatineau, Quebec * Library and Archives Canada, Acc.

Ossoli≈Ñski was a Calvinist, and a leader of Protestants in the province of Ma≈Çopolska during the reign of king Zygmunt August. Ossoli≈Ñski was also one of the leaders of the Executionist movement, which sought to reform 16th century Polish politics. Early life In his youth, Hieronim was sent by his family to study abroad. During this time, most likely in Germany, he became familiar with Calvinism, converted, and would remain a faithful adherent and advocate for Protestantism throughout his life. He also served under Gian Giacomo Medici in Italy and participated in the taking of Siena. Executionist movement and Union of Lublin Ossoli≈Ñski was one of the leaders of the Executionist movement, which sought to reform 16th century Polish politics. As an \\"Executionist\\", Ossoli≈Ñski promoted the return of state lands illegally seized by some magnates back to the crown, an increase in the powers of the lesser and medium nobility (szlachta), a curtailment of the rights of the Catholic clergy, enforcement of separation of powers in regard to the holding of public offices, religious tolerance, and reform of public finances. Ossoli≈Ñski, like most other Executionists was also a strong proponent of the unification between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Crown of Poland. He was considered a main force behind the treaty of unification (Union of Lublin) which was established at the 1569 Sejm. Before the treaty was implemented, Ossoli≈Ñski argued that Poland and Lithuania were already technically united through the agreements made between Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (originally from Lithuania) and the Grand Duke Vytautas, and was probably the author of a political pamphlet De unione Lithwaniea (\\"On the Lithuanian Union\\"). He was one of the signatories of the treaty. Continuing this political line, Ossoli≈Ñski and other Executionists sought closer political integration between the various provinces of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that had been established by the 1569 Sejm; Prussia, Lithuania, Ruthenia and \\"Korona\\". Protestant leader and advocate for religious toleration Along with Rafa≈Ç Leszczy≈Ñski, the voivode of Brze≈õƒá Kujawski, Ossoli≈Ñski proposed the establishment of a national church in Poland, with king Zygmunt August as its head. The original proposal envisioned the establishment of such a Church with approval from the Papacy, although both Ossoli≈Ñski and Leszczy≈Ñski were willing to cut all ties with Rome if such approval was not granted. The two politicians made the motion at a Sejm of Piotrk√≥w in 1555, but it was not accepted. Three years later, at another sejm, Ossoli≈Ñski unsuccessfully proposed that Catholic bishops were to be prohibited from sitting in the Polish Senate. In 1573, Ossoli≈Ñski was one of the signatories of the Warsaw Confederation. The confederation issued a document which formally and legally established freedom of religion in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. While previously religious tolerance was a de facto policy of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Confederation made it constitutionally de jure. In the same year Ossoli≈Ñski supported the election of Henry of Valois to the throne of Poland and took part in the coronation. Soon, however, Ossoli≈Ñski came to oppose the king and supported his dethronement. Family and personal life Hieronim was the son of Pawe≈Ç Ossoli≈Ñski and Zbigniewa S≈Çupecka. Probably circa 1546 he married Katarzyna Zborowska (of the Zborowski family). They had eight surviving children: * Jan Ossoli≈Ñski (1576) ‚Äì Starosta of P≈Çock * Hieronim Ossoli≈Ñski (died 1581) * Piotr Ossoli≈Ñski (died 1580) * Miko≈Çaj Ossoli≈Ñski (died 1598) ‚Äì Lord of Klimontow * Zofia, married Stanis≈Çaw Drohojowski * Jan Zbigniew Ossoli≈Ñski (1555‚Äì1623) ‚Äì Starosta of Sandomierz, chancellor to the King of Poland. * Andrzej Ossoli≈Ñski (1616) ‚Äì ≈ªupnik of Ruthenia * Marcin Ossoli≈Ñski ‚Äì Crown Rotamaster He most likely forced his son, Jan Zbigniew Ossoli≈Ñski, to convert to Calvinism. After his father's death, Jan, as well as several of the other children reverted to Catholicism. He died around 1576 and was buried in Go≈∫lice, in a church which he had converted into a Calvinist Zb√≥r (in Poland- Lithuania and Bohemia a type of Protestant place of worship). His tombstone was sculpted by the Italian-Polish architect Santi Gucci, and had been commissioned by Hieronim himself. It was destroyed during World War I, in 1915, and restored after World War II on the basis of archival photographs.

History The restaurant, initially called Osteria da Cencio (Cencio's Eatery), was opened in 1941 by the couple Vincenzo \\"Cencio\\" and Renata de Santis, who decided, following an episode involving the actor Massimo Serato, to combine traditional food with a form of entertainment based on folk songs often seasoned with risque jokes and profanities in the Romanesco dialect. The establishment became popular with the public and so in 1951, it officially took the name \\"La Parolaccia\\" and became a place for special dinners for actors and people in the show business. Film references Vittorio Caprioli, Marcella Valeri, and Mickey Fox at \\"La Parolaccia\\" in a scene from the film Trastevere (1971) Thanks to its peculiarity, La Parolaccia has inspired the mention of fictitious restaurants in various comedy films such as Made in Italy (1965), Simpatici & antipatici (1998), and in 1981, Fracchia la belva umana (where it is renamed \\"Da Sergio e Bruno - Gli Incivili\\") as well as in the 1977 poliziottesco La banda del trucido with Tomas Milian (here the restaurant is called \\"La Pernacchia\\" - The Raspberry).

Accessed November 2011. Walt Disney, Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Flatley.Huggard family and hotel register November 1947 But it has a written history closely linked with the history of Ireland that extends back to 1884. In that year the Commercial Cable Company established a transatlantic cable station in the village while the Direct United States line had already one at Ballinskelligs and the first cable had been laid into Valentia Island a quarter of a century before. Overview =Golf and Angling= J B Hayens, Leamington, arrived on 20 March 1884. Spent eight weeks in the Butler Arms and found everything as comfortable as any angler could wish for. Sport on the lake very good. Caught salmon of an average weight of 13 lbs. T. C. Kingsmill Moore, who later became Justice of the Supreme Court stayed in the hotel in 1932 to fish on the lake and feature his experience in his acclaimed angling book, A Man May Fish.Hotel register 1932; Supreme Court list of judges; Saracen Books In previous times the course designer, Lionel Hewson, came to the Butler Arms for golf and peace. While he was laying out Tralee Golf Course at Oakpark he was unsettled by men watching him from the fence. =Historic guests= Beside Hewson's name on his first visit to the Butler Arms in 1916 is that of Captain Richard Aramberg Blennerhassett Chute and Mrs Chaloner Chute of Chute Hall and Blennerville in Tralee. And Mrs Chaloner Chute and her children, Desmond and Chaloner, returned to the hotel without the captain the following year. Sir Horace Plunkett came to the hotel twice in 1891, immediately after his appointment to the newly formed Congested Districts Board. From there he saw the conditions of the people and formulated his vision of setting up the cooperative societies and creameries of Ireland.Hotel register July and September 1891; Plunkett, Sir Horace. Ireland In the New Century (1904;) Breathnach, Ciara. The Congested Districts Board 1891-1923 (2005) In August 1899 the hotel register was graced with the name of Roland Allanson Winn. He was an engineer who had built roads in India and designed coastal defences at Bray in Wicklow and Youghal in Cork along with coast protection in his home territory of Glenbeigh. The following year, as a new century began and a new Land Act was widely anticipated, James Burns Hartopp of Scraftoft Hall in Leicestershire came to the hotel. Lord Dunraven, who chaired the Land Conference of 1902, was a frequent visitor to the hotel. =Women of great influence and wealth= Women of great influence and wealth also came to the Butler Arms, amongst them, in 1937, the Countess of Lauderdale of Thirlstane Castle in Berwickshire, then one of the grandest private residences in Scotland. Lady Maud Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marchioness of Lansdowne of Bowood House in Wiltshire also spent time at the hotel in 1903. As the daughter of the first Duke of Abercorn and Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Alexandra of Denmark, she held extensive influence in her own right, while her husband, the fifth Marquess of Lansdowne held numerous posts including Viceroy of India and Governor General of Canada. =The scenery= Lady Maud Landsdowne or The Countess of Lauderdale, like many others, didn't come to the hotel for golf or fishing but rather to relax in its comforts and enjoy the scenery as described in Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay's The History of England from the Accession of James the Second 'Capes stretching far into the Atlantic.' > The south western part of Kerry is now well known as the most beautiful > tract in the British Isles. The mountains, the glens, the islands, the capes > stretching far into the Atlantic, the crags on which the eagles build, the > rivulets brawling down rocky passes, the lakes overhung by groves in which > the wild deer find covert, attract every summer, crowds of wanderers sated > with the business and pleasures of great cities. The beauties of that > country are indeed too often hidden in the mist and rain which the west wind > brings up from a boundless ocean. But on the rare days when the sun shines > out in all his glory, the landscape has a freshness and warmth of colouring > seldom found in our latitude.The myrtle loves the soil. The arbutus thrives > better than on the sunny shores of Calabria. The turf is of livelier hue > than elsewhere. the hills glow with richer purple, the varnish on the holly > and ivy is more glossy; and berries of a brighter red peep through foliage > of a brighter green. . , 'Freshness and warmth of colouring seldom found in our latitudes'..the islands..too often hidden in the mist and rain which the west wind brings up from a boundless ocean'. =The Railway leads to Expansion of Tourism= Bradshaw's Railway Guides would also promote the scenery and fishing but not in such unique words as Lord Macaulay's and the coming of the railway to Killarney in 1853 was of great benefit to the Butler Arms Hotel and to Kerry in general. When the Butler Arms opened in 1884 it not only benefited from the cable companies but nine years later the railway was extended to Cahersiveen and Renard Point opposite Valentia Island. The Huggard family, who had bought the hotel from the McElligotts soon spread their wings along the railway lines and came to own the Royal Hotel in Valentia, The Caragh Lake Hotel and the Lake Hotel in Killarney, the last of which is still in their possession. =Writers and Film Stars= In the 1960s business was at a peak and Charlie Chaplin and his family were almost turned away; but the owner stepped forward and gave them his private suite. It was the beginning of a great relationship, as they returned for long holidays several times after that. Walt Disney and his wife and daughters had stayed there in 1947 and with them was Dr James Delargy, the man who had set up the Irish Folklore Commission. Song of the South, from the Uncle Remus stories of Joel Chandler Harris of Georgia (1946) was a box office success at the time Disney met Dr Delargy and Dr Delargy had taken down more folklore from Sean O Connell in Ballinskelligs, across the bay from the hotel, than had ever been collected from one source at any time. Famous writers such as Alfred Perceval Graves, Virginia Woolf and John Steinbeck also stayed in the Butler Arms but Chaplin is remembered best of all. A statue of him stands, life size on the street, and a festival runs for his honour. But a young Miss Blake who holidayed in the hotel with her parents and throughout her married lifetime remembered a moonlit night in 1932 when John McCormack sang his best from the steps of the hotel stairs.Hotel register 1932 and 1947; Peter Huggard, Monica Fitzgerald and Dr Tim O'Connor, son of Mrs O Connor. The Butler Arms register The hotel register wasn't preserved so well from the end of the 1950s and it hasn't been relied on for the article. But its quality and neatness until then allows for a unique summary regarding those who once graced the hotel carpets. The very first guest in the Butler Arms left an account of what he hoped for and what he found in the hotel and in Lough Currane. But his address, Leamington, is so broad that it allows no enquiry into his own story. Hundreds of entries in the register have similarly broad addresses. The finding of such precise addresses as Scraftoft Hall or Thirlestane Castle has been great, and only equalled by finding the inclusion of double barrel and treble barrel Christian names that link the guests unmistakably with their positions and stories.

The capital letters \\"K,\\" \\"W\\" and \\"S\\" in the name KWS stand for Klein Wanzlebener Saatzucht, which means seed breeding from Klein Wanzleben. The company‚Äôs original headquarters were in Klein Wanzleben, an East German town located near the city of Magdeburg. Its main markets are in Europe, North and South America as well as Asia. KWS has breeding and distribution activities in more than 70 countries. In 1954, the company went public on the Hamburg-Hannover Stock Exchange and has been on the SDAX list of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since June 2006. In addition, the shares are listed in the Nisax20 index of shares in Lower Saxony. History In 1838 the Kleinwanzleben Zuckerfabrik (Kleinwanzleben Sugar Refinery) was founded as a stock company.Detlef Diestel, \\"Sugar Refinery Klein Wanzleben from Foundation to 1917/18,\\" in Landwirtschaft und Kapitalismus, Bd. 1, Teil 2, Berlin 1979, p.63 In 1856 the majority of its shares were acquired by the sugar beet grower and farmer Matthias Christian Rabbethge, one of the pioneers of the German sugar industry. In the same year he and his then future son-in-law Julius Giesecke founded a general commercial partnership (OHG). In 1885 the Rabbethge & Giesecke OHG became a joint stock company (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Zuckerfabrik Klein Wanzleben formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke Aktiengesellschaft (AG). In 1937 it was changed into Rabbethge & Giesecke AG because the Reichsn√§hrstand did not want any anonymous investors in the agriculture and forestry sector. After the Second World War the company was relocated to the Lower Saxonian city of Einbeck which has been its headquarters since then. In 1946 a rescue company was established under the name Rabbethge & Giesecke Saatzucht GmbH. The foundation of this rescue company was necessary in order to continue the Western activities of the original joint stock company, which was still based in Klein Wanzleben.Betina Mei√üner, \\"Planting Seeds for Success,\\" Wallstein Publishing House, G√∂ttingen, 2007, pp. 90-91. In 1951 the two companies were merged and took the title Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke AG. In 1975 it was changed into KWS Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke and then finally reduced to KWS SAAT AG in 1999.In spring 2015, KWS SAAT AG was renamed the European stock corporation KWS SAAT SE. At the beginning of July 2019, KWS completed a transformation of its legal form into KWS SAAT SE & Co. KGaA. The first international branch of KWS was established in 1900 in the Ukrainian town Vinnytsia to meet the demand of sugar beet farmers in Russia. In 1920 the company began to expand its business into corn, fodder beet and potato breeding. Following the relocation to Einbeck, KWS focused on the breeding of sugar beet, corn, rapeseed, sunflower, cereals and potatoes. In the years directly after the war, the company became an important supplier to the West German sugar beet industry. Since 1963 it has established subsidiaries in Europe, North and South America, Asia and North Africa. Expansion and acquisitions In the 1950s the company began intensifying its business in Western and South European countries. At the same time it also started to expand its activities in the US sugar beet market. In 1956 KWS acquired the company Segenta in Chile and Pan Tohum Islah ve √úretme A.S. in Turkey. In 1967/68 it began merging its cereal breeding activities with the companies Heine-Peragis and Lochow-Petkus GmbH. In 2008, KWS acquired Lochow- Petkus GmbH which was subsequently renamed KWS LOCHOW GMBH.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=118953744.

In the 1990s the company acquired the Argentinean breeding company Trebol Sur which was then renamed KWS Argentina in 1997. In 2000 the French plant breeding group Limagrain and KWS decided to merge their corn business in North America and formed the joint venture AgReliant.

Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544 (1980), was a United States Supreme Court case that determined \\"seizure\\" occurs when an officer uses displays of authority to detain a person.. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit heard the appeal of Ms. Sylvia Mendenhall as pertaining to Ms. Mendenhall's alleged unconstitutional seizure by two DEA agents at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The court ruled against the defendant in a 5‚Äì4 majority, though the court's Dissent shows confusion as to the majority vote. The decision notably set a standard by which a valid consensual stop could be converted into an unconstitutional Terry stop, such as by \\"the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled.\\" Background On the morning of February 10, 1976, Sylvia Mendenhall was walking through the concourse of Detroit Metropolitan Airport after disembarking a commercial flight returning from Los Angeles. During her walk through the airport, she was noticed by two Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents. The two agents grew suspicious, later stating that she appeared to have the characteristics of a person unlawfully transporting narcotics. The agents approached Mendenhall and identified themselves as federal agents. Following procedure, they began to question Ms. Mendenhall; their questions included, \\"How long were you in California?\\" to which she responded by stating that hers was a short, two-day trip. The agents later asked her to present identification and an airline ticket. She presented her driver‚Äôs license and the airline ticket to the agents. The name on the driver‚Äôs license said ‚ÄúSylvia Mendenhall‚Äù, yet the name on the airline ticket was ‚ÄúAnnette Ford‚Äù. Upon questioning, she responded, ‚Äú[I] just felt like using that name.‚Äù \\"Agent Anderson then specifically identified himself as a federal narcotics agent and, according to his testimony, the respondent \\"became quite shaken, extremely nervous. She had a hard time speaking.\\"Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 548. The agents requested that the respondent accompany them to the DEA office at the Airport; she did so willingly. At the office, the agents asked for permission to inspect her handbag and her person and informed her of her right to decline. She responded, \\"Go ahead,\\" while handing her purse to the agent. A female police officer arrived at the office to conduct the search. The officer also proclaimed that the respondent had the right to decline to the search. When asked to remove her clothes, she explained that she had a flight to catch, but was assured that if she had no narcotics on her, that there would be no issues. Without further comments, she began to disrobe. Two packages were found beneath her undergarments and were handed to the policewoman. One package appeared to contain an illegal substance. The respondent was arrested for possession of heroin. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan denied the motion to suppress the evidence. The court concluded that the agents' actions were permissible in investigating suspicion of criminal activity. The respondent voluntarily accompanied the agents to the DEA office. The court convicted Sylvia Mendenhall. The court of appeals reversed the decision, stating that the respondent did not properly consent to the search. =Drug-courier profile as testified by DEA Agent= \\"The agent Manuel Lopez testified that the respondent's behavior fit the 'drug courier profile'‚Äîan informally compiled abstract of characteristics thought typical of persons carrying illicit drugs. In this case, the agents thought it relevant that (1) the respondent was arriving on a flight from Los Angeles, a city believed by the agents to be the place of origin for much of the heroin brought to Detroit; (2) the respondent was the last person to leave the plane, 'appeared to be very nervous,' and 'completely scanned the whole area where [the agents] were standing'; (3) after leaving the plane, the respondent proceeded past the baggage area without claiming any luggage; and (4) the respondent changed airlines for her flight out of Detroit.\\"Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 547 n.1. Conflict The issue requesting clarification was whether or not the respondent's Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The court failed to construct a majority defining \\"seizure\\". Whether or not the respondent voluntarily consented to the search or was coerced into it, there is sufficient evidence that the respondent was given the option to go on her way. According to Justice Stewart, evidence that the respondent was not asked to go to the DEA office with the agents is not enough to dismiss that the respondent gave consent.. There was no evidence of force, and the respondent's voluntary accompanying the agents is sufficient to side with the District Court. Evidence that she was a 22-year-old Negro with no high school diploma and was being apprehended by white agents, though not completely irrelevant, was held as not being decisive evidence. The Fourth Amendment serves \\"to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.\\" United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554. As long as the person being questioned has the right to disregard the questions and has the right to vacate, then a search does not impede on a person's liberty or privacy. Police questioning is an effective manner of enforcing criminal law. The questioning of Sylvia Mendenhall furthered the compelling interest of the DEA. \\"Without such investigation, those who were innocent might be falsely accused, those who were guilty might wholly escape prosecution, and many crimes would go unsolved. In short, the security of all would be diminished.\\" Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. at 225. Because the respondent was not held by force and could have walked away, she was not technically \\"seized\\" by the DEA agents. Since there is no constitutionally protected interest in regard to the \\"seizure\\" of a person, we are left with the precedent in Terry v. Ohio. In Terry, a police officer identified himself and the three gentlemen in question mumbled something leading Officer Mcfadden to believe they were dangerous. The officer grabbed Terry and threw Terry between the officer and the other two suspects. Terry was lawfully \\"seized\\" under the impression he was dangerous. In this case, Terry was unable to walk away and forced to a search. Based on the precedent provided by Terry, the search and seizure of Mendenhall was lawful. Historical significance =State v. Cook, 107 Ohio App. 3d 154 (1995)= \\"Applying United States v. Mendenhall, defendant was seized when four officers approached and ordered [the defendant's] companion, then the defendant, to step out of [the defendant's] parked truck.\\" =United States v. Drayton (2002)= In United States v. Mendenhall, the court determined that \\"seizure\\" occurs when an officer uses physical force or displays authority to detain a person. In United States v. Drayton, the court determined that the Fourth Amendment does not govern consensual encounters.. In Drayton, a police officer identified himself and asked a passenger on the bus if the police had consent to perform a drug and illegal weapon search. Another officer stood at the front of the bus but did not block the exit. The court ruled that this did not violate constitutional rights. Based on Mendenhall case, a law enforcement officer publicly approaching an individual and asking such individual questions is not a violation of the individual's Fourth Amendment rights. As long as the officer does not imply that compliance is mandatory, the officer may question or ask to examine the identification of an individual. Powell's Concurrence \\"Mr. Justice Powell, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. \\"I join Parts I, II-B, II-C, and III of the Court's opinion. Because neither of the courts below considered the question, I do not reach the Government's contention that the agents did not \\"seize\\" the respondent within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In my view, we may assume for present purposes that the stop did constitute a seizure. I would hold‚Äîas did the District Court‚Äîthat the federal agents had reasonable suspicion that the respondent was engaging in criminal activity, and, therefore, that they did not violate the Fourth Amendment by stopping the respondent for routine questioning.\\" White's Dissent \\"Mr. Justice White, with whom Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice Stevens join, dissenting. \\"The Court today concludes that agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) acted lawfully in stopping a traveler changing planes in an airport terminal and escorting her to a DEA office for a strip-search of her person. This result is particularly curious because a majority of the Members of the Court refuse to reject the conclusion that Ms. Mendenhall was \\"seized,\\" while a separate majority decline to hold that there were reasonable grounds to justify a seizure. Mr. Justice Stewart concludes that the DEA agents acted lawfully, regardless of whether there were any reasonable grounds for suspecting Ms. Mendenhall of criminal activity, because he finds that Ms. Mendenhall was not \\"seized\\" by the DEA agents, even though, throughout the proceedings below, the Government never questioned the fact that a seizure had occurred necessitating a [display] of antecedent reasonable suspicion. Mr. Justice Powell's opinion concludes that, even though Ms. Mendenhall may have been \\"seized,\\" the seizure was lawful, because her behavior while changing planes in the airport provided reasonable suspicion that she was engaging in criminal activity. The Court then concludes, based on the absence of evidence that Ms. Mendenhall resisted her detention, that she voluntarily consented to being taken to the DEA office, even though she, in fact, had no choice in the matter. This conclusion is inconsistent with our recognition that consent cannot be presumed from a showing of acquiescence to authority, and it cannot be reconciled with our decision last Term in Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200 (1979).\\" =Summary of Dissent= Mr. Justice White's reason for dissent is based on the contradiction that the majority does not refute that a \\"seizure\\" did occur, while at the same time a majority was unable to justify that the \\"seizure\\" was necessary. Mr. Justice Powell strongly believes that Ms. Mendenhall was forced into the search, even though there is a lack of evidence that she did not have the opportunity to leave.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The inn originated from two former houses, their undercrofts now forming the inn's cellars. The older house, on the east side, is dated 1637, and the west house dates probably from the early 18th century. Part of Chester Rows formerly passed through the buildings, but this was enclosed in 1711. The inn also incorporates a former cottage to its rear built on a burgage plot. When it opened as an inn it was called The Star Inn, but later changed its name in the late 18th century because the custom house of the port of Chester stood opposite. The building has been altered on a number of occasions, most recently in the 1990s when an extension was added to the rear of the former west house. Architecture The former east house is constructed with sandstone in the lower storey, and timber framing above. It has an undercroft, and two storeys plus an attic. On the side facing Watergate Street is a gable, an entrance door, a beer-drop door, and a five-light transomed window in the lower storey. Between the storeys is a bressumer carved with vine leaves, grapes, and the initials \\"T.W.A.\\". The upper storey contains a seven-light transomed oriel window, with a small two-light window on each side. Around these windows are panels, some of which are plain, the others arched. The gable is jettied and carries the date 1637. It contains a three-light mullioned casement window with herringbone struts at the sides and above it. The bargeboards are plain. The former west house has a rendered lower storey, and a brick upper storey. It has a doorway and two three-light windows in the lower storey, and sash windows above. The former cottage at the rear is in Georgian style. It is constructed in brick on a sandstone plinth, with a grey slate roof. It contains sash windows, and two dormers in the gables above. Many alterations have been carried out to the interior of the inn, but it does retain oak beams dating from about 1642, and a carved stone fireplace.

He continued his philosophical studies in Jersey, France, and his theology in Posillipo, Naples, in Italy, both centres of Jesuit teaching. He was ordained a priest in 1922. Afterwards, he taught ethics in Ireland, and history of philosophy in Catania, Sicily. In Malta he taught philosophy, apologetics, mathematics, physics, and sociology. Between 1928 and 1945 Busuttil was Prefect of Studies at St. Aloysius College, Malta. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Busuttil would go around cities and villages gathering people in public squares and introducing them to the social teaching of the Catholic Church. After the war he was than especially close to workers who were part of the newly founded General Workers Union, particularly at the shipyards. To people like Busuttil, the main worry in those days was the infiltration of the communist ideology within the workers‚Äô movement. In 1947 he was appointed Spiritual Director of the union, an office he held up till 1951. He died in 1956. Works Busuttil brought together his philosophical erudition and prowess, and his interest in mass education, particularly of workers. To this effect, he published a large number of pamphlets ‚Äì more than sixty ‚Äì which could serve as pocket-guides to the themes he chose to deal with. Though adopting a popular style and common language, he backed any of his arguments with a philosophical line of reasoning. Amongst his most worthy of consideration to philosophy, and also the most representatives of Busuttil‚Äôs thoughts and style, are the following: * 1945 - Dokumentazzjoni Nisranija-Kommunista (Christian-Communist Documentation). * 1946 - Dostoievsky: Habbar tal-Bolxevizmu (Dostoyevsky: The Harbinger of Bolshevism). * 1946 - That il-Hakma tal-Mingel u tal-Martell (Under the Yoke of the Sickle and Hammer). * 1946 - It-‚ÄòTest Case‚Äô Jew Il-Kalvarju tal-Polonja (The Test Case or Polond‚Äôs Calvary). * 1946 - Il-Gwerra, il-Paci u l-Knisja (War, Peace and the Catholic Church). * 1946 - Responsabbiltajiet u Rikostruzzjoni Socjali (Responsibilities and Social Riconstruction). * 1946 - Zewg Gganti: USSR - USA (Two Giants: USSR - USA). * 1946 - Demokraziji u Partit (Democracies and Political Parties).

He studied at the Academy of Performing Arts, Bratislava, Slovakia, and is deemed one of the most influential modern Slovak composers. He died of heroin overdose at the age of 20. Life and career Marek Brezovsk√Ω was the son of Ali Brezovsk√Ω, a well-known Slovak music composer. He started taking piano lessons at the age of 5 and later studied composition at the Bratislava Music School (Konzervat√≥rium). From 1993, he continued his composition studies at the Bratislava Academy of Performing Arts up until his untimely death in 1994. Music was the essence of Brezovsk√Ω's life. During his studies at the Music School, he founded S√∫bor s√∫ƒçasnej hudby (The Contemporary Music Ensemble) where he was engaged as both a composer and a piano player. The Contemporary Music Ensemble performed Brezovsk√Ω's classical music pieces (Miniat√∫ra pre sl√°ƒçikov√Ω orchester ‚Äì Miniature for String Orchestra, Venovan√© ne≈°≈•astiu ‚Äì Dedicated to Sorrow and many more). He also founded the Art-M Trio, an art rock band (Marek Brezovsk√Ω ‚Äì keyboards, vocals; Marek Min√°rik ‚Äì bass guitar; Michal Kres≈•anko ‚Äì drums). The band's live performances accrued plaudits from both critics and audiences. It was then that Brezovsk√Ω made his first studio recordings. Many songs and pieces from this period later appeared on albums (Hrana ‚Äì The Edge, 1999) and (Komorn√° Hudba ‚Äì Chamber Music, 2004). Brezovsk√Ω was also a member of a punk rock group, Avanavany. Brezovsk√Ω composed a soundtrack to the musical film, Muzik√°l (produced by the Slovak Television). In 1994, he wrote scores for the Pressburger Blut performance (a play staged by the GUnaGU Theater). His music was also used in Chekhov's The Seagull (ƒåajka ‚Äì performed by the Nitra Theater, Slovakia). In 2000, the performance received the Dosky Award (The Slovak Theatre Awards) for best score. His classical music compositions are performed at numerous classical music festivals. In 1999, Brezovsk√Ω's close friend, Oskar R√≥zsa, put together a band to produce and record the album Hrana (The Edge) with Brezovsk√Ω's compositions. The album contains 14 original tracks, 2 of which are re-mastered versions of rare recordings Brezovsk√Ω had performed at the age of 17. The album has since become legendary and is considered one of the masterpieces of the Slovak music scene. In 2011, Oskar R√≥zsa et al. commenced the \\"Hrana Tour\\" (The Edge Tour). Live performances introduced all tracks from the original CD as well as several thus far unknown compositions from Brezovsk√Ω's legacy. The tour was very successful. In 2014, Slovak director Patrik Lanƒçariƒç released Hrana: 4 filmy o Marekovi Brezovskom (The Edge: 4 Films About Marek Brezovsk√Ω), a documentary on Brezovsk√Ω's life and work. In the near future, a new CD with Brezovsk√Ω's unreleased tracks is expected to be produced.

On October 20, 2010, Yao Jiaxin, a 21-year-old music student from Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, ran down and injured a restaurant waitress, Zhang Miao, while driving, then got out of his car and stabbed her to death when he saw her memorizing his license plate number. Yao was put on trial on March 23, 2011, was sentenced to death on April 22, 2011, and executed on June 7, 2011. This case brought much public attention because of Yao‚Äôs family background and whether the death penalty was improper.  Summary  On the night of October 20, 2010, Yao Jiaxin, a pianist studying at Xi‚Äôan Conservatory of Music, hit cafe waitress Zhang Miao with his Chevrolet Cruze as she was riding her bicycle. When he got out of the car, he found Zhang trying to memorize his license plate number. As he was afraid that Zhang would get him in trouble or ask for compensation over this accident, he took out a knife and stabbed her eight times until she died. When he was trying to escape, he hit two other people on the road and was eventually apprehended. However, the police released him because of lack of evidence. The police did not manage to properly connect the two accidents and charge him with murder until October 22. Yao confessed on October 23, and was put on trial on March 23, 2011 at the Xi‚Äôan Intermediate People‚Äôs Court. Since he had shown remorse for the murder, it was quite likely that he would escape the death penalty. However, after this case was exposed by the media and discussed heatedly on the internet, most netizens demanded Yao receive the death penalty. Using Human Flesh Search, people were able to discover that Yao's father was a well-placed military representative in Xi‚Äôan, which added to popular resentment of him. On the other hand, a crime psychologist, Li Meijin, made controversial comments on the case in an interview on China Central Television, which were also maligned by netizens. She posited that Yao‚Äôs behavior in stabbing the woman eight times was related to his miserable experience of playing piano during his childhood. ‚ÄòHis behavior of stabbing the victim eight times could have been a mechanical repetition of him hitting the piano keys‚Äô, said Li. However, she was seen as an unabashed apologist for Yao. Netizens called her the 'defender of a murderer' and also launched a Human flesh search engine to discredit her. Many people also thought that the state media coverage of the case was biased, as it covered only the murderer without any empathy for the victim.  Discussion  = The Education System = During the trial, Yao's lawyer pleaded for leniency by saying Yao was a 'model student', with many awards for academic excellence. This was very ironic and led to heated discussion over the Chinese education system. While most parents only care about children's grades, they care less about their character and moral compass. Such a rigid education deprives children of their natural development and makes them indifferent about life. = Abolition of Death Penalty = There was a heated debate on the internet by many public figures about whether capital punishment in China should be abolished. The debate was triggered by the murder case of Yao. According to an online Yahoo survey about whether Yao should get the death penalty, 96.5% (10,710 out of 11,100) of the respondents said that he should. One of the reasons for the widespread public outrage towards Yao is that they were afraid that China would be controlled by jungle law.  Result of Trial and Responses  Yao was found guilty by the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court, and sentenced to death on April 22, 2011. He appealed the court's decision to the Shaanxi Provincial Higher People's Court, which rejected his appeal on May 20. The Supreme People's Court reviewed the case and upheld the death sentence, concluded that the first and second trials were without error. 'The motive was extremely despicable, the measures extremely cruel and the consequences extremely serious,' said the SPC. Yao was executed on June 7, 2011. Public reaction towards the execution varied on the internet. Some claimed that it was a victory for public action over the privileged class, while others considered Yao a victim of cyberstalking/online mobs.

This technique was introduced by Hugues Hoppe in 1996. This method uses saving a model to the structure - the progressive mesh, which allows a smooth choice of detail levels depending on the current view. Practically, this means that it is possible to display whole model with the lowest level of detail at once and then it gradually shows even more details. Among the disadvantages belongs considerable memory consumption. The advantage is that it can work in real time. Progressive meshes could be used also in other areas of computer technology such as a gradual transfer of data through the Internet or compression. D. Luebke, M. Reddy, J. D. Cohen, A. Varshney, B. Watson, R. Huebner: Level of Detail for 3D Graphics, Morgan Kaufmann, 2002, Basic principle A progressive mesh is a data structure which is created as the original model of the best quality simplifies a suitable decimation algorithm, which removes step by step some of the edges in the model (edge-collapse operation). It is necessary to undertake as many simplifications as needed to achieve the minimal model. The resultant model, in a full quality, is then represented by the minimal model and by the sequence of inverse operations to simplistic (vertex split operation). This forms a hierarchical structure which helps to create a model in the chosen level of detail. ECOL VSPLIT =Edge collapse= This simplistic operation - ecol takes two connected vertices and replaces them with a single vertex. Two triangles {vs, vt, vl} and {vt, vs, vr} which were connected by the edge are also removed during this operation. =Vertex split= Vertex split (vsplit) is the inverse operation to the edge collapse that divides the vertex into two new vertices. Therefore, a new edge {vt, vs} and two new triangles {vs, vt, vl} and {vt, vs, vr} arise.

It has a max. length of 0.85 kilometres and max. width of 0.76 kilometres. Etymology, geography Gadsar Lake from the Gadsar Pass at mount Vishnu Gadsar in Kashmiri means the lake of fishes, a natural habitat of trout and other types of fishes among of which is the brown trout. The lake freezes in the month of November to April and is mostly covered by snow during these months, the floating ice bergs are seen even in summer. It is surrounded by alpine meadows full of various kinds of wild alpine flowers, therefore the lake is also called as the valley of flowers. The lake is mainly fed by melting of glaciers. The Gadsar Lake outflows through a stream flows north westwards and joins Neelum River at Tulail.  Access  The Gadsar Lake is situated 108 kilometres northeast from Srinagar city. From Naranag a 28 km alpine track leads to the lake. Another track of 41 km northwest from Shitkadi Sonamarg via Vishansar Lake and Krishansar Lake leads to the Gadsar Lake crossing two mountain passes of Nichnai and Gadsar of more than 4100 meters above sea level. The best time to visit is from the month of June to September. Gadsar, the lake of death The Gadsar Lake is also named as Yemsar which means the lake of demon and is referred as the lake of death. A myth still unresolved. Shepherds grazing their flocks in the outskirts of Gadsar lake during summers believe that, there lives a Lake Monster, a freshwater Octopus which drags the creatures from shores by its tentacles into the water. There is an uncertainty in the minds of visitors, a kind of threat which prevents them going near the shores. The shepherds also chose otherwise grazing their flocks at the shores of the lake. The fishes are being caught outside the lake in a stream from which it flows out.

The ship entered service with the Department of Transport Marine Service in 1959 and transferred to the newly created Canadian Coast Guard in 1962, active until 1986. The icebreaker was sold to private interests in Newfoundland and the ship sat idle after 2001 until resold in 2009 to GTX Technology Canada Limited and renamed Polar Prince. Rebuilt, the icebreaker is now plying the waters of the Arctic Ocean. In 2017, the vessel was temporarily rechristened Canada C3 and used for a high-profile voyage around Canada's three maritime coasts as part of the nation's 150th anniversary. Design and description The icebreaker is long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The ship has a fully loaded displacement of and a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 2,153 and as built. The vessel is powered by diesel-electric engines (DC/DC) driving two shafts turning fixed-pitch propellers creating . This gives the vessel a maximum speed of . The vessel can carry of diesel fuel and had a range of at and could stay at sea for up to 30 days. The vessel was remeasured as with a in 1985. Construction and career =Government service= The icebreaker was constructed by Davie Shipbuilding at their yard in Lauzon, Quebec with the yard number 614 and was launched on 29 October 1958. Sir Humphrey Gilbert, named for an early explorer of the Northwest Passage, was commissioned into the Department of Transport's Marine Service in June 1959. In 1962, all Marine Service icebreakers were transferred to the newly formed Canadian Coast Guard. The vessel was registered in Ottawa, Ontario and homeported at St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador in the Newfoundland Region. On 20 December 1963, the French vessel Douala transmitted a distress signal off the coast of Newfoundland. Sir Humphrey Gilbert had already been detailed to aid a fishing vessel in the Atlantic, but was redirected to Douala as the French ship was in danger of foundering. While heading to Douala a barge broke loose aboard the Coast Guard vessel, causing damage to the ship and it was some time before the barge could be secured due to icing conditions. The Coast Guard vessel was delayed in arriving on the scene by the barge and on 21 December, Douala sank. 19 crew members of Douala were rescued on 22 December, of which two died while returning to Newfoundland. 13 members of the crew died in the water. In 1983, Sir Humphrey Gilbert became the test vessel for the Coast Guard's lay day crewing system. Under the lay day system, each ship has two crews which rotate on a 28-day interval. While on board the ship, the crew perform 12-hour work shifts, seven days a week. At the end of the 28-day interval, the crew rotates off the ship for a four-week break. The trials proved a success and the system was adopted fleet-wide. =Post government service= Bella Bella, British Columbia in 2017 The ship was taken out of service in 2001 and handed over to Crown Assets Distribution. The vessel was renamed 2001‚Äì06 in 2001 and in 2002 Gilbert 1. Polar Prince In 2002, the icebreaker was sold to Puddister Trading Co. Ltd of St. John's and renamed Polar Prince. In 2002, the vessel was acquired by Star Line Inc. In 2005, the vessel was laid up at Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador and put up for sale by Star Line on eBay. The vessel was later sold to GX Technologies of Calgary, Alberta in 2009 and modernized. Canada C3 In 2017, Polar Prince was chartered and (temporarily) rechristened Canada C3 for a high-profile summer-long, 15-leg cruise around Canada in celebration of Canada's 150th anniversary. The ship departed on 1 July from Toronto, Ontario, and sailed down the Saint Lawrence Seaway and St. Lawrence River to Halifax, Nova Scotia via the Northumberland Strait and the Canso Canal, then travelled north around Newfoundland, the Labrador coast, around Baffin Island and through the Northwest Passage, then around Alaska and down the Pacific coast through the Inside Passage, to Victoria, British Columbia. The journey lasted 150 days and included stops at numerous Aboriginal communities along the way.

The site was a spin-off and expansion of Bleszinski's Oakland Athletics-focused blog Athletics Nation, which sought to provide coverage of the baseball team from a fan's perspective. The popularity of the site led to other sports blogs being incorporated. In 2008, SB Nation hired former AOL executive Jim Bankoff as CEO to assist in its growth. He showed interest in SB Nation goal of building a network of niche-oriented sports websites. By February 2009, the SB Nation network contained 185 blogs, and in November 2010, ComScore estimated that the site had attracted 5.8 million unique visitors. The 208 percent increase in unique visitors over November 2009 made SB Nation the fastest-growing sports website the company tracked at the time. = Continued growth and expansion into other content areas = In 2011, Bankoff hired a number of former writers from AOL's technology blog Engadget, including former editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky, to build a new technology- oriented website that was in the same network as SB Nation. These writers had originally left AOL following a series of conflicts between Topolsky and Michael Arrington, author of TechCrunch (which AOL had recently acquired), and the leak of an internal training document that outlined a content strategy for AOL's blogs that prioritized profitability. Bankoff felt that a technology- oriented website would complement SB Nation due to their overlapping demographics. In November, the renamed Vox Media officially launched The Verge, with Topolsky as editor-in-chief. In 2012, Vox Media launched a video gaming website, Polygon, led by former Joystiq editor Christopher Grant. In November 2013, Vox Media acquired Curbed Network, which consisted of the real- estate blog network Curbed, the food blog Eater, and the fashion blog Racked. In April 2014, the company launched a news website, Vox. Led by former Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein, Melissa Bell and Matthew Yglesias, Vox was positioned as a general interest news service with a focus on providing additional context to recurring subjects within its articles. In May 2015, Vox Media acquired Recode, a technology industry news website that was founded by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, the former editors of The Wall Street Journals All Things Digital. In May 2017, Vox Media announced that it had entered into an agreement to provide technology and advertising sales for Bill Simmons' sports website The Ringer, as part of a revenue sharing agreement. In February 2018, it was reported that Vox Media would be laying off around 50 employees, particularly surrounding video production. CEO Jim Bankoff stated previously that the company planned to exit native video for Facebook due to \\"unreliable monetization and promotion\\". The memo announcing the layoffs argued that despite its success, native video \\"won't be viable audience or revenue growth drivers for us relative to other investments we are making\\", and that the company wanted to focus more on podcasting and Vox Entertainment. The layoffs represented around 5% of Vox's workforce. In April 2019, Vox Media acquired magazine Epic, which would become part of a new division called Vox Media Studios, which had also absorbed Vox Entertainment and the Vox Media Podcast Network. In September 2019, Vox Media agreed to acquire and merge with New York Media, the parent company of New York magazine. The California Assembly Bill 5 was passed in September 2019, and the bill aimed at improving the working conditions for contract workers. In response to this bill, Vox Media announced in December 2019 that it would terminate more than 200 contracts of California-based freelance writers for SB Nation, and replace these writers with 20 full-time staff writers. On April 17, 2020, Vox Media announced it would furlough 9% of its workforce from May 1 to July 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Corporate affairs  = Funding = In December 2014, Vox Media raised a round led by the growth equity firm General Atlantic, estimating the media company's value at around .

According to sources, the Series C in May 2012, valued Vox Media at $140 million. A Series D valued the company north of , raising an additional . In August 2015, NBCUniversal made a equity investment in Vox Media, valuing the company at more than . Comcast, which owns NBC, additionally already owned 14% of Vox through other subsidiaries. = Union = In January 2018, Vox Media agreed to recognize a labor union, the Vox Media Union, which had been formed by its editorial staff with help from the Writers Guild of America, East. On June 6, 2019, more than 300 employees under the Vox Media Union staged a walkout over failed labor agreements between the union and Vox Media, leading to most Vox Media websites without operation. The Vox Media Union negotiated with management during the widespread furloughs caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. The union \\"won a guarantee of no layoffs, no additional furloughs, and no additional pay cuts through July 31, along with enhanced severance for any layoffs that occur in August-December.\\" = Litigation = In September 2017, Vox Media was sued by Cheryl Bradley, a former manager of the \\"Mile High Hockey\\" site for SB Nation, which covered the Colorado Avalanche team. The suit alleged that Bradley, despite being an employee of the company working 30‚Äì40 hours (and sometimes up to 50 hours) a week, was only paid a stipend per month, wherefore Vox Media had failed to reach obligatory wage and hour protections. Fellow former site managers John Wakefield and Maija Varda were later added to the suit as plaintiffs, and Vox Media unsuccessfully tried to have the case dismissed. The suit was granted class action status by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in March 2019. A second labor suit was filed as a class action lawsuit in California in September 2018, citing the Fair Labor Standards Act. Because this lawsuit could have covered 258 plaintiffs and damages of up to , Vox Media had the suit moved to the United States federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act. In several cases, plaintiffs represented by the attorney Richard Liebowitz sued Vox Media over copyright infringement claims.

Developed specifically for SB Nation, it facilitates content creation, and implemented commenting and forums, which allowed for company growth, later evolving to analyze viewership and distribute content via various multimedia platforms. In 2014, Ezra Klein and Melissa Bell left The Washington Post to join Vox Media, in part because of the publishing platform. Additionally, the founders of Curbed, Eater, and The Verge said Chorus was a key reason for partnering with Vox Media.

It was co-founded by Tyler Bleszinski and Markos Moulitsas in 2005. The blog from which the network formed was started by Bleszinski as Athletics Nation in 2003, and focused solely on the Oakland Athletics. It has since expanded to cover sports franchises on a national scale, including all Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League, and National Hockey League teams, as well as college and soccer teams, mixed martial arts and professional wrestling, totaling over 300 community sites. In 2011, the network expanded into technology content with The Verge, leading to the parent company Sports Blogs Inc. being rebranded as Vox Media. SB Nation operates from Vox Media's offices in New York City and Washington, D.C.  Corporate affairs and business model  From 2005 to 2011, the sports blog network SB Nation (originally known as Sports Blog Nation) operated under the parent company SportsBlogs Inc., which was headquartered in Washington, D.C.. Since Sports Blogs was rebranded as Vox Media, the network has also operated from the digital media company's offices in Manhattan. Vox Media's chief executive officer, Jim Bankoff, has served as SB Nation CEO since 2009. Elena Bergeron serves as editor-in-chief. Many contributors to SB Nation work as part-time contractors, and are paid a stipend each month. The network generates revenue through advertising.  History  SB Nation was co-founded by friends Tyler Bleszinski and Markos Moulitsas in 2005. The single blog from which the network formed was launched by Bleszinski as Athletics Nation in November 2003, and covered only the Oakland Athletics baseball team. Athletics Nation quickly became Blogads's second largest website, following Daily Kos, where Moulitsas served as an editor. Following the blog network's creation, six additional writers were hired to join Bleszinski in creating content, and Daily Kos' platform was implemented to encourage online community growth. Established bloggers were selected to contribute articles, and sports fans could leave comments. After sites were created for all Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and National Hockey League (NHL) franchises, along with some college and other teams, Bleszinski focused on company growth and making money. In 2008, SB Nation raised $5 million in a Series A round of financing with Accel Partners, Allen & Company, and Ted Leonsis contributing. Jim Bankoff, who was advising the company during the venture round, became SB Nation CEO in January 2009. The network had approximately 1 million unique users, and nearly 185 blogs by February. The NHL sanctioned and began linking to SB Nation content on its official website in April, when the network was averaging 5 million unique monthly visitors across nearly 200 sites. In July, Comcast's venture capital branch, Comcast Interactive Capital, spearheaded a nearly $8 million second round of financing. In September 2009, SB Nation was re-launched to serve as a nationally focused portal for the network's blogs. Revenue generated by the network increased by four times in 2009. In 2010, the network launched 20 regional sites, bringing the total number of sites to nearly 275. SB Nation had 31 full-time employees and was receiving 40 million monthly page views by approximately 8 million unique users, as of mid 2010. Comcast SportsNet and SB Nation agreed to a content sharing partnership in shared markets in June 2010. In November, Khosla Ventures led a third round of funding for SB Nation. The $10.5 million received brought the company's total funding to approximately $23 million. SB Nation acquired the blog networks FanTake and The Offside in March 2011, expanding its coverage of college sports and soccer, respectively. The network hired several Engadget employees to launch its first major expansion outside sports. SB Nation parent company, SportsBlogs Inc., rebranded as Vox Media in October, and The Verge launched in November. In late 2011, MMAFighting.com was integrated into SB Nation after Vox Media acquired the mixed martial arts site from AOL. MMA Fighting produces The MMA Hour and The MMA Beat, which continue to stream on SB Nation and social media outlets, as of 2017. In September 2012, SB Nation introduced a major redesign codenamed \\"SB United\\", which introduced a new \\"magazine-style\\" layout with a larger focus on long-form content and digital media, and redesigned logos for each of the network's approximately 300 blogs. The redesign was overseen by Spencer Hall, the site's first editorial director. The LGBT sports website Outsports was acquired by Vox Media and integrated into SB Nation in March 2013. The site's founders retained editorial control, and the purchase marked the first time a major sports media company acquired an LGBT-focused website. SB Nation was averaging approximately 50 million unique visitors by mid 2013, and had approximately 800 contributing bloggers by the end of the year. Elena Bergeron was named SB Nation editor-in-chief in 2017. In mid 2017, the sports and culture website The Ringer transferred its publishing platform from Medium to Vox Media's Chorus platform. The site's founder, Bill Simmons, retained ownership and editorial control. The Ringer parent company, Bill Simmons Media Group, and Vox Media agreed to share revenue generated by advertisements sold by Vox Media. Vox Media began sharing audience traffic between SB Nation and The Ringer. In February 2018, Vox Media laid off 50 employees, including some members of the SB Nation social video team. In August 2019, after closing its national college football blog Every Day Should Be Saturday (which joined the platform in 2010 after originally being established in 2005 as an independent website), SB Nation announced a new college football vertical known as Banner Society, which will aim to \\" keep expanding, warping, and sharpening the conversation around college football in all its bizarre, corrupt, colorful elements\\", and \\"find new and different ways to connect with our audience directly, all over the internet\\". In December 2019, Vox Media announced that in order to comply with California Assembly Bill 5, SB Nation would \\"end our contracts with most contractors at California brands\\" over the coming months, and transfer their roles to a new group of employees. The company stated that this would be an extension of investments that have seen more full-time employees working for the network's largest sites, and that former contractors would be able to contribute as unpaid \\"community insiders\\". On April 17, 2020, in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, parent company Vox Media announced it would furlough 9% of its workforce starting May 1, 2020, including SB Nation. = Video content = In May 2016, SB Nation created an online video series for NBC Sports around NBC Sunday Night Football.

The piece, which was seen as sympathetic to Holtzclaw, was heavily criticized and was taken down within hours of publication. SB Nation's editorial director Spencer Hall apologized for \\"a complete breakdown\\" of SB Nation editorial process, and described the story and its publication as a \\"complete failure\\" of site standards. SB Nation subsequently cut ties with the story's author, freelance journalist Jeff Arnold, and put its longform program on hiatus pending a peer review of the editorial process that led to the Holtzclaw piece being published. The head of the longform program, veteran sportswriter Glenn Stout, was suspended and later fired. In May 2016, Vox Media published the results of the peer review. It found that the longform program was isolated from the rest of SB Nation in a way that made it impossible for stories to be properly vetted. It also harshly criticized SB Nation for not giving individual editors the authority to review stories about sensitive topics. At the time, sensitive stories were reviewed by the newsroom's two most senior women, senior editor Elena Bergeron and senior content producer Sarah Kogod. The reviewers found that this practice made it appear that an individual editor did not have the responsibility to \\"care to the fullest extent about matters of ethics, integrity, and accuracy.\\" It also raised concerns about the lack of diversity in the newsroom.Peer review of Holtzclaw story Based on the review, SB Nation permanently shelved the longform program, replacing it with a features program. SB Nation also announced it would take steps to diversify its newsroom. In a statement, SB Nation said that the Holtzclaw situation revealed that \\"an organization cannot afford to wait to be diverse, particularly if that organization is one that wants to tell stories.\\"  Recognition  In 2011, Time included SB Nation in their list of \\"50 Websites That Make the Web Great\\". SB Nation was a finalist in the seventh annual Shorty Awards \\"fansite\\" category (2015), and received a National Magazine Award (or Ellie Award) in the \\"Digital Innovation\\" category in 2018 as the publisher of Jon Bois narrative, 17776.

Congress adopted legislation establishing the memorial on October 23, 2000, authorizing the Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial Foundation to design, raise funds for, and construct the memorial. The fundraising goal was reached in mid-2010, and ground for the memorial broken on November 10, 2010. The memorial was dedicated by President Barack Obama on October 5, 2014. Genesis of the memorial =Legislative approval= In 1995, Lois Pope, widow of National Enquirer owner Generoso Pope Jr., met a disabled American veteran at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and realized there was no memorial in the city which honored disabled veterans. Although she did not know him, Pope called the office of United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown to plead for a memorial. Pope called every day for the next six months, until finally Brown's secretary put her call through. Brown agreed to support legislation establishing a memorial. Because the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 (P.L. 99-625) barred the expenditure of federal funds for memorials, a foundation needed to be established to oversee private fundraising. Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson, the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), an organization founded in 1920 to assist disabled veterans. The DAV was itself not a nonprofit, and thus Pope and Wilson agreed that a new foundation, the Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial Foundation (DVLMF; also known as the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation) should be created. Brown (who left office in 1997), Pope, and Wilson incorporated the foundation in 1998, and Wilson was named its president. The three individuals and their supporters began lobbying Congress to win passage of the necessary federal legislation. The effort was announced on November 9, 1998.; ; They received the support of Senators John McCain (R-Arizona), Max Cleland (D-Georgia), and John Kerry (D-Massachusetts), who introduced legislation authorizing a memorial in the United States Senate in January 1999 (106th Congress). Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative John Murtha (D-Pennsylvania). The CWA proved to be an obstacle for the memorial foundation. The Commemorative Works Act barred construction of any memorial on the National Mall or its immediate environs unless 25 years had passed since the event, or the last surviving member of the group had died. Exemptions could be made for events or individuals of singular importance or long-lasting historic significance. That exemption could only be issued by the National Capital Memorial Commission (NCMC). The memorial foundation sought just such an exemption, but in November 1999‚Äîjust before Veterans Day‚Äîthe NCMC denied the exemption. Veterans groups were outraged, and Pope declared that \\"bureaucracy\\" was standing in the way of honoring people who had \\"taken a bullet\\" for the nation. The NCMC defended its decision, pointing out that Congress enacted the law to slow the rapid proliferation of memorials on the Mall. The agency also noted that there were already many memorials to veterans and to several wars on the National Mall. Since very little space remained for memorials, what was left should be kept open for future generations, NCMC officials argued. In the wake of this decision, the legislation's backers in Congress quickly added new language to their bill exempting the memorial form the CWA's National Mall ban. The National Park Service and the United States Department of the Interior now opposed the legislation because of this exemption. But Congress quickly approved the bill, and President Bill Clinton signed it into law (Public Law 106-348) on October 24, 2000. Most of the rules of the CWA still applied to the disabled veterans' memorial, however. The memorial foundation was required to raise enough private funds to design and build the memorial, and an amount equal to 10 percent of the memorial's construction cost also needed to be raised and placed in a trust fund for the memorial's maintenance and operation. The CWA gave the foundation seven years to begin construction, or its authorization would expire. =Site selection= Parcels of land (A, B, and C) allotted to the American Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial. The first site selected by the memorial foundation was disapproved. The foundation asked for a site within the Reserve, an area which included the National Mall and its immediate surroundings (as defined by federal law and regulation). On January 16, 2001, the NCMC voted 6-to-0 (with one abstention) to deny approval for a memorial anywhere in the Reserve. Foundation executives were angered. Jesse Brown, now executive director of the foundation, said the NCMC was declaring that \\"2.3 million disabled veterans are not good enough\\" to be on the Mall. Lois Pope took issue with the NCMC's conclusion that the memorial was not of lasting importance or historic significance, arguing, \\"We wouldn't have freedom if it wasn't for these men and women.\\" Two weeks after the ruling, The Washington Times published an editorial by Art Wilson which attacked the NCMC's decision. The DVLMF considered asking Congress to overturn the NCMC's ruling, but decided against doing so. Extensive controversy surrounded the decision of the National World War II Memorial Advisory Board to seek an exemption for its memorial, which led to expensive lawsuits and significantly delayed the National World War II Memorial construction. \\"We [didn't] want to go down that road,\\" said Brown. Following the siting guidelines and maps provided by the NCMC, the DVLMF looked at more than 50 potential memorial sites throughout the National Capital Area. Foundation leaders worked closely with D.C. government officials to identify a site. Ten sites were short-listed by the city and foundation, although the DVLMF only seriously considered six of these. The District pushed for the memorial to be located in an existing park-like triangle of land bounded by Washington Avenue SW, C Street SW, and 2nd Street SW. The site was southwest and across the street from the United States Botanic Garden's Bartholdi Fountain Park, and less than two blocks from the United States Capitol. The site was man-made, built using air rights when the tunnel carrying Interstate-395 was constructed from 1965 to 1973. The lot was city-owned, but the city was willing to transfer it to the National Park Service. Robert Hansen, the foundation's chief operating officer, praised D.C. officials for their assistance. Lois Pope personally agreed to the site selection. Key considerations for the DVLMF were the site's proximity to Capitol Hill, the museums of the Smithsonian Institution, and Washington Metro subway stations. The foundation submitted its site selection report to NCMC in August 2001. On August 30, NCMC voted unanimously to approve the memorial foundation's preferred site on Washington Avenue SW. NCMC gave active consideration to six of the sites proposed by the foundation. District of Columbia officials strongly supported the preferred site in their testimony before the commission. D.C. officials expressed concern about two issues, however. The first was the number of pedestrians crossing 2nd Street SW to the east and Independence Avenue SW to the north to reach the memorial. The second was the weight of the planned memorial. The man-made below-ground structure supporting the existing parkland and streets was not designed to carry a heavy granite or bronze memorial, nor the weight of a fountain. They cautioned that the District of Columbia supported the preferred site only because they understood that the memorial would consist of a garden rather than sculpture or a monument. City officials, however, pledged to work with memorial designers to overcome these problems. Brown testified that the DVLMF supported the site because it had a direct line of sight with the U.S. Capitol, and would remind members of Congress of their weighty responsibilities when considering issues of war and peace. The memorial site also required approval from the National Capitol Planning Commission and the United States Commission of Fine Arts. But no significant opposition was expected from either body, since representatives from both agencies served on the National Capital Memorial Commission. The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) quickly approved the site as well. The memorial foundation said its proposed memorial would cost $35 million in August 2001. If design approval and fund-raising went as expected, the foundation said it would begin construction by spring 2005. Fundraising and extension of deadline =Early fundraising efforts= Section 10(b) of the Commemorative Works Act, as amended by Public Law 102-216 (December 11, 1991), limited the legislative authorization for memorials in the National Capital Region to seven years unless otherwise specified by the memorial's enacting legislation. A memorial's site and design must be approved; the memorial foundation must show that art, architectural, and historic preservationists were consulted in the memorial's design and siting; contracts for construction must be signed; and sufficient funds to complete construction of the memorial must be in hand before the seven-year deadline was reached.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 8(a)(1) through 8(a)(4); An Act to lengthen from five to seven years the expiration period applicable to legislative authority relating to construction of commemorative works on Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs, Public Law 102-216 (December 11, 1991). In 2003, Congress relaxed this standard slightly. The Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the General Services Administration, in consultation with NCMC, had the discretion to issue a construction permit if both the NCPC and CFA had issued final (not preliminary) design approval and the foundation had 75 percent of the construction funds in hand.Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108‚Äì126 (November 17, 2003), Title II‚ÄîCommemorative Works, Section 203-Clarifying and Conforming Amendments, (c) Authorization. Furthermore, Section 8(b) of the Commemorative Works Act required that each memorial foundation raise an amount equal to 10 percent of the total construction cost, and to deposit these monies into a trust fund administered by the Department of the Interior to pay for the cost of perpetual maintenance and preservation of the work.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 8(b). The foundation did not begin fund-raising until August 2002. Just how much money the foundation needed was unclear, with some sources claiming $35 million but others $60 million. One of the first fund-raising efforts involved the sale of a gold- plated commemorative medallion priced at $29.95 each. To urge the public to donate, Pope herself paid for advertisements which featured General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, poet Maya Angelou, and National Football League star Michael Strahan. On Veterans Day in 2002, the Lois Pope LIFE Foundation donated $2 million to the project. The same day, the Disabled American Veterans said its chapters would also begin fund-raising for the memorial. Shortly thereafter, the DVLMF launched a direct mail fund-raising effort as well. By 2004, despite the passage of four years, the memorial's cost was still being pegged by the DVLMF at $60 million. About $20 million was budgeted for restoring C Street SW to its traditional east-west alignment so that a unified plot of land could be created for the memorial. Fundraising also continued. The DVLMF contracted with Tom Brokaw, former NBC News anchor and author of the book The Greatest Generation (1998), to host a fundraiser in New York City in April 2004, and the estate of Jesse Brown (who died in 2002) agreed to donate the proceeds of Brown's book The Price of Their Blood: Profiles in Spirit (which documented the lives of 10 disabled veterans) to the memorial construction fund. But one fundraising effort was stalled. Senator Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota) introduced legislation in July 2003 to authorize the United States Mint to manufacture commemorative coins which would be sold to raise money for the memorial. The coins would sell for $10 each (with a legal tender face value of $1). The cost of manufacturing the coins would come from the sale price, with the remainder going to the memorial construction fund. Johnson submitted additional legislation in 2004 after the 2003 bill stalled. This legislation passed the Senate, but stalled in the House.\\"Sen. Johnson Bill to Honor Disabled Veterans Passes Senate.\\" Press release. Office of Senator Tim Johnson. U.S. Senate. October 12, 2004. Johnson's bill died at the end of the 108th Congress, locked in a House committee. Nevertheless, the DVLMF said in April 2004 construction on the memorial would begin in the spring of 2005. =Second wave of major donations= By November 2005, the DVLMF acknowledged that the cost of the memorial had risen to $65 million. To boost fundraising efforts and national awareness of the memorial, the DVLMF hired actor Gary Sinise, who played the crippled Vietnam War veteran Lt. Dan Taylor in the 1994 film Forrest Gump, to serve as the memorial's national spokesman. Pope was personally responsible for inviting Sinise to join the effort. The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) became the first large national veterans' organization to make a donation to the memorial effort when it gave $100,000 on December 28, 2005. Another major donation announced the same day came from the Fifth Third Bank Foundation, which said it would match donations to the DVLMF up to $100,000 a year for five years. These donations brought the total amount of funds raised to more than $10 million.\\"Philanthropist Lois Pope Challenges States To Raise $5 Million, Which She Will Match, For American Veterans Disabled For Life Memorial.\\" Press release. Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation. December 19, 2005. Additionally, Lois Pope made her own personal donation to the DVLMF when she provided a matching donation of $5 million. But despite these major donations, overall fundraising was still slow. This began to delay the construction start date. By December 2005, the groundbreaking date for the memorial had slipped to 2010. (One newspaper reported that Pope hoped to break ground in 2006, and dedicate it in 2011.) Funds continued to arrive in 2006. By March, Pope's donations and matching donations totaled $2 million. The following month, Leo Albert, the former chair of the board of directors of Prentice Hall, donated $1 million to the memorial fund. Lois Pope agreed to match the donation. Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi was added to the memorial's advisory board to help with fund-raising, and the president and CEO of Fifth Third Bank, George Schaefer Jr., was added to the same body in April. DVLMF planners still insisted that the memorial would open in 2009 or 2010. In October 2006, a second national spokesperson, the comedian Phyllis Diller, was added to the memorial foundation's fundraising efforts. =Financial problems= Comparison of the memorial's original site (left) and the site after modification by P.L. 109-396, which truncated the southern portion of the proposed grounds. In March 2005, Senator Johnson re-introduced his American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act (S. 633). The Senate adopted the bill in the summer of 2006. Companion legislation (H.R. 1951) was introduced in the House in April 2005 by Representative Sue W. Kelly (R-NY). But the bill stalled in the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology. The Disabled American Veterans (DAV) railed against the congressional inaction to its membership in November 2006. But once more legislation died at the end of the congressional session. Still, memorial planners were optimistic, saying they expected the bill to pass early in the next session‚Äîwhich would enable them to raise funds much faster and dedicate the memorial in 2010. Jurisdiction over the memorial site was transferred from the District of Columbia to the Department of the Interior (National Park Service) by the Federal and District of Columbia Government Real Property Act of 2006 (Public Law 109‚Äì396). Title II, Section 201(a)(2) gave the federal government control over the site, barred the realignment of C Street SW without the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, and required an east-west pedestrian walkway across the southern part of the site. Jurisdiction over the subsurface (footings, soils, tunnels, walls, and related items) was retained by the District of Columbia. Sources differ as to how much money the foundation had raised by 2007. The Palm Beach Daily News said just $20 million in April 2006. The Philadelphia Inquirer quoted Pope, who claimed $35 million in July 2007, and the Kansas City Star suggested the foundation had raised about $32 million. But a report released by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources put the figure at just $26 million in September 2007. By this time, the Newark Star-Ledger said in May 2007, Pope had pledged $8 million of her own (not LIFE Foundation) money, the DAV had pledged another $3 million, and the DAV's affiliates were raising contributions. It was also unclear just how much money was needed. Sources continued to put the figure at $65 million in 2006 and early and mid-2007, although that figure had not risen appreciably in nearly five years despite inflation. Nevertheless, the ADVLMF continued to claim it would have enough money on hand to break ground on the memorial in 2008 and dedicate it in 2010. { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"width: 30%; border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" + Income and Expenditures of the DVLMF, 1998‚Äì2005 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: lightblue; color: black\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: lightblue; color: black\\"  Income ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: lightblue; color: black\\"  Expenditure - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  1998  $50,000  $36,760 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  1999  $50,240  $46,283 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  2000  $50,307  $38,741 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  2001  $70,600  $366,452 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  2002  $4,663,383  $444,300 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  2003  $1,799,217  $2,498,734 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  2004  $2,078,566  $3,328,008 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  2005  $5,660,984  $7,918,068 - align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: lightyellow; color: black\\"  Total  $14,423,297  $14,677,346 } In April 2007, the Palm Beach Post newspaper broke a story in which it suggested the DVLMF was in serious financial trouble. The memorial foundation was running a deficit of almost $255,000, the newspaper said, and had more than $2 million in unpaid debts. The paper suggested that the foundation's spending was the problem. Nonprofit \\"watchdog\\" groups said charities should spend 75 percent on their mission program, 15 percent on administration, and just 10 percent on fundraising. But the DVLMF was spending 88 percent of its money on fundraising. The memorial foundation was strongly criticized on this point by watchdog groups. Charity Navigator Sandra Miniutti said her group gave the foundation zero out of four stars (its lowest rating) and scored DVLMF's operations: \\"Their finances are out of whack, and it appears they are not adhering to their mission\\". Charity Brands Marketing, a group which helps match donors to charities, was also highly critical. Their chief executive officer, Stephen Adler, warned DVLMF was spending too heavily on fundraising: \\"The numbers tell the story, and that's not an acceptable number for a nonprofit\\". The Palm Beach Post also reported that Lois Pope had used money from her LIFE Foundation to keep the DVLMF afloat. The DVLMF was $267,089 in deficit by the end of 2001, and the LIFE Foundation's 2002 donation of $3.5 million had kept it afloat. Rick Fenstermacher, an DVLMF consultant, admitted that Pope had pledged even more, but declined to say how much the additional donation was worth. The DVLMF categorically denied it was in any financial difficulty. It admitted spending $4.9 million on fundraising in 2005, most of it to purchase personalized items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, stadium blankets, and umbrellas to mail to potential donors. But such expenditures were paying off, it said. The foundation had mailed 8.5 million letters to potential donors by March 2007, and received 749,306 donations with an average value of $16.58. Fenstermacher asserted that steep initial investment costs were to be expected, and that non-final 2006 fundraising figures were \\"stellar\\". Bob Montgomery, Pope's attorney, also justified the fundraising strategy. \\"You have to have parties...,\\" he told the Palm Beach Post, noting that people gave money at these types of events. He pointed to a gala hosted in 2006 by the DVLMF in Palm Beach which raised $500,000. Another scandal hit the DVLMF in 2007 when Lois Pope was sued by her son, Paul D. Pope. Tensions between mother and son had simmered for years, driven largely by financial issues. Paul Pope contended that his mother promised him a $1 million a year income as well as a home and luxury automobile, and then reneged on the promises. He claimed that his mother's support of the DVLMF was to blame for the broken agreement, and asserted that the memorial foundation had squandered $14 million on high staff salaries, parties, and expensive trinkets. He also alleged that the DVLMF had commissioned two reports from consultants, and that these reports accused the foundation of \\"poor financial performance and a lack of accountability\\". Montgomery labelled his claims \\"baseless\\". Lois Pope counter-sued Paul Pope, demanding repayment of a $340,000 personal loan. She also accused him of squandering the $20 million which he inherited from his father, and lavishly spending $840,000 a year. These legal issues were subsequently settled when an agreement was reached in which Lois Pope gave Paul and his five siblings a combined $12 million. Despite the negative press, major donations continued to come in. Donald Trump gave $25,000 for an illuminated flag and flagpole at the memorial in late August 2007. =Authorization extension= With nowhere nearly enough money on hand to begin construction by the legislatively mandated deadline, the memorial foundation petitioned Congress for an extension, arguing that fundraising would be complete by 2010. Legislation to extend the deadline was introduced in the House of Representatives (H.R. 4275) in 2006 and passed, but received no consideration in the Senate. The legislation died at the end of the 109th Congress on December 8, 2006. Representative Phil Hare (D-Illinois) introduced similar legislation (H.R. 995) in 2007, which passed the House on March 5, 2007. A companion measure (S. 824) was introduced in the Senate by Senator John Thune (R-South Dakota). S. 824 passed on October 24, 2007, and a day later President George W. Bush signed P.L. 110-106 into law. The law extended the deadline for construction to begin to October 24, 2015. =Commemorative coin fundraising= The memorial foundation next asked Congress to assist with its fundraising through the issuance of a commemorative coin. Since the passage of the United States Commemorative Coin Act (P.L. 104-329) in October 1996, many groups (including those building federal memorials) had raised funds by paying the United States Mint to manufacture commemorative coins. To participate in the commemorative coin program required an act of Congress, however. This time, the DVLMF commemorative coin act originated in the House of Representatives. Representative Dennis Moore (D-Kansas) introduced H.R. 634 in January 2007, and it passed the House 416-to-0 in May. Senator Tim Johnson then introduced companion legislation (S. 2119) in the Senate in October 2007. The DVLMF told members of Congress that the foundation had raised roughly $43 million of the $65 million needed to build the memorial, and that commemorative coin sales would allow it to complete fundraising in 2008. The Senate Banking Committee favorably reported the legislation on May 20, 2008, with clarifying legislation from Senator Johnson. The Senate adopted the amended bill by a unanimous vote on June 10, and the House adopted the Senate bill on June 18. On July 17, 2008, President George W. Bush signed the American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act (Public Law 110‚Äì277) into law. Although the coin had a face value of $1, it sold for $10 (the standard surcharge), with the entire amount of the surcharge (less costs) going toward construction of the memorial and the creation of the maintenance trust fund. Just 350,000 coins were made. The commemorative coin was released on February 25, 2010, and 190,000 were sold within the first two months. A total of 281,071 coins were sold by the end of 2010. =Post-commemorative coin fundraising efforts= Fundraising improved markedly after passage of the commemorative coin act. As the commemorative coin act legislation was pending, the DAV announced in March 2008 an additional donation of $600,000‚Äîhalf of which came from the state chapter in California, and half of which was a matching donation by the DAV. But although the national DAV had pledged to match state donations up to $3 million (for a total DAV state and national contribution of $6 million), $2.4 million of the pledge was still unfulfilled by early 2008. A second major memorial donation came in April 2008 when businessman H. Ross Perot agreed to give three annual payments of $1 million each to the DVLMF. Perot's contribution (the largest yet from an individual or group not already associated with the memorial foundation) brought the total amount of funds raised for construction and maintenance to $55.1 million. At this point, the DVLMF still claimed they only needed $65 million to begin construction. News sources reported that the foundation intended to begin and finish construction in 2010. By November 2008, however, the published cost of the memorial had risen sharply to $86 million. (The $86 million figure included the maintenance trust fund donation.) The DVLMF accepted another $200,000 combined donation that month from the DAV, which reported that it had contributed less than $2 million of its $3 million matching-fund commitment. The DAV's donation pushed the total funds raised for the memorial past the $70 million mark. On December 1, Lois Pope made good on her matching-grant pledge and presented the DVLMF with a check for $5 million.\\"Lois Pope Presents Check for $5 Million to American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.\\" Press release. Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation. December 1, 2008. By this time, Pope's total contributions to the memorial foundation totaled $8.6 million. Fundraising continued in fits and starts. By April 2009, the DVLMF still had only about $70 million on hand. But just a month later, donations reached $80.1 million. By October 2009, with the memorial's cost still pegged at $86 million, the DVLMF was predicting a 2010 dedication. Rick Fenstermacher, who had now joined the DVLMF as its chief operating officer, said the foundation would begin the process of obtaining a construction permit from the U.S. Department of the Interior. Building the memorial =Groundbreaking= By early 2010, the Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation had about $2.0 million to $2.5 million still to raise to complete its $86 million campaign. By this time, Lois Pope had donated between $8.5 million and $9 million of personal and LIFE Foundation money (sources vary), and the DAV and its members had donated another $10 million. Major corporate sponsors included AT&T; and Ford Motor Company. Although it was short of its total fundraising goal, the memorial foundation had 75 percent of construction costs in-hand and final approval of the memorial design, so it successfully petitioned the Department of the Interior to issue a construction permit. Ground was broken on the memorial site on November 10, 2010. Attending the groundbreaking were Lois Pope, Art Wilson, and Gary Sinise, all representing the DVLMF; Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki; former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi; and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California). More than 400 members of the public, most of them disabled veterans, watched the ceremony. The DVLMF said the memorial would be dedicated on Veterans Day in 2012. =Final fundraising= Just how much money remained to be raised after the memorial's groundbreaking was not clear. Some sources said $2.5 million, another reported $3.2 million, while another claimed $3.5 million. To raise the final funds needed for the memorial, the DVLMF relied heavily on commemorative coin sales. Also unclear is how costly the memorial now was. One source said $86 million, but other sources said the cost was just $85 million and the DVLMF claimed in May 2011 that it had dropped to $82 million.\\"Reflecting on Memorial Day, Philanthropist Lois Pope Makes an Additional $1 Million Gift to Building of American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.\\" Press release. Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation. May 23, 2011. In February 2011, Pope announced she would match donations to the memorial foundation up to $500,000. The next May, Pope made a final, $1 million contribution to the DVLMF. The memorial foundation said that her total giving now topped $10 million. By October 2011, the DVLMF needed just $250,000 to reach its fundraising goal, which foundation officials felt might be reached by selling the last remaining commemorative coins. Just how close the DVLMF was to its fundraising target can be seen in the activities of some of its most active donors. Pope's LIFE Foundation held its 18th and final \\"Lady in Red\\" gala event in Palm Beach in November 2011. According to Pope, \\"This gala will be the last to raise funds for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial as we have reached [the LIFE Foundation's] fundraising goal.\\" =Construction= Construction proceeds on the foundations for the star- shaped fountain at the memorial site. The southern segment of the memorial's \\"Wall of Gratitude\\" (left) is ready for cladding, while wooden forms surround the northern section (right), which is still curing. Fabrication of elements of the memorial, preparation of the site, and memorial construction began in 2011. Bronze artworks were part of the memorial design, and in May 2011 the DVLMF announced that sculptor Larry Kirkland, who designed the bronze panels, had been also commissioned to fabricate them. Washington, D.C.-based Tompkins Builders was chosen in June 2011 to oversee the memorial's construction. Construction was to have begun in June 2011, but problems emerged. Five utilities (including four communications lines and one electrical line)\\"PEPCO Begins Work At Disabled Veterans Memorial Site.\\" Press release. American Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial Foundation. December 18, 2012. were discovered to have lines running below the site. While the utilities that owned these lines could move them quickly, the cash-strapped District of Columbia required federal funds to assist it in managing the street closures and infrastructure improvements that would be made during the relocations. Because of this, the National Park Service declined to issue a construction permit until a program had been worked out to move these utilities and obtain these funds. Construction of the memorial subsequently occurred in two phases. Phase I consisted of removing and rerouting fiber optic cables, broadband computer lines, telephone lines, and other communication lines from beneath the memorial site. Phase II consisted of realigning the city streets and relocating traffic signals. Work began on Phase I in the fall of 2011, but the communications lines were not rerouted until fall 2012. By November 2012, granite for the memorial was being quarried, and work on the bronze statues was under way. With Phase II construction to take 12 months, DVLMF officials said they hoped for a November 2013 dedication. Throughout the latter half of 2011 and the first half of 2012, memorial foundation and D.C. officials sought the necessary highway construction funds. The fund worked closely with Senator Patty Murray (D-Washington), then-chair of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs; Representative Nancy Pelosi; Representative Tom Latham (R-Iowa), chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies of the House Committee on Appropriations; then-Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood; and Victor Mendez, Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, to secure the funds. Their efforts were successful, and in mid-2012 the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) received a $6 million grant from the Public Lands Highway Discretionary Program to construct the street realignments and complete Phase II. Work on the glass panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates to assist with the selection of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them‚Äîrepresenting a wide diversity of voices spread through time‚Äîwere used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water jet cutter to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass fabricator (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized bus shelter glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art abrasive blasting to etch the photo-realistic images into the glass. Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, to laminate the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size. Technifex, a special effects company located in Valencia, California, was hired in 2011 to design and fabricate the one-of-a- kind steel system providing natural gas to the eternal flame. Technifex also designed the electronically controlled ignition system that would keep the flame lit. Work on the bronze panel artworks was under way by mid-2012. These panels were fabricated at the Walla Walla Foundry in Walla Walla, Washington. The process was much simpler than creating the glass panels. Sculptor Kirkland created a silhouette of the figures he wanted for the panels. Red wax slabs in size were created, and the shape cut into them by a computer-controlled router. The shapes did not need to be perfect, as Kirkland preferred a slightly imperfect image that gave the viewer the impression that the \\"artist's hand\\" was still crafting the work. The bronze panels were then cast using the lost-wax method. By November 2012, all utilities except the electricity had been relocated. In mid-December 2012, Pepco began relocation of the electrical line. DDOT said it would call for proposals to do the street work later that month, award a contract in January or February 2013, and begin construction work in March. By this time it was not exactly clear what the DVLMF's construction timeline was, however. In November 2012, the DAV reported that the memorial would be completed and ready for dedication in early 2014. But the DVLMF said in December 2012 that the dedication would be in October 2014. By March 2013, the DAV also reported the dedication date as October 2014. Finally, in March 2014, the DVLMF set the dedication date for October 5, 2014.\\"The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, D.C. Sets October 5, 2014 Dedication Date.\\" Press release. Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation. March 18, 2014. Design of the memorial =Design competition= The design of memorials on federal property in the District of Columbia are subject to the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts (CFA), and the D.C. Historic Preservation Office. The first design element imposed on the memorial regarded the site. In approving the memorial foundation's preferred site in October 2001, the NCPC said that the site should be configured to allow C Street SW to be restored to its historic alignment. This changed slightly the geometry of the memorial site, and restricted the amount of on-site parking which the memorial planners desired. To design the memorial on the slightly restricted site, the memorial foundation held a design competition. On November 11, 2002, the DVLMF invited about 20 architects and landscape architects to submit design proposals for the memorial. Six firms responded with a proposal. The DVLMF established a nine-member design committee consisting of members of the foundation's Board of Directors as well as architects, artists, and landscape architects. In February 2003, the six proposals were presented anonymously to the design committee. Two firms, Michael Vergason Landscape Architects and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, were asked to submit a refined proposal. This second proposal included, among other things, cost estimates, a project schedule, and a scale model. The design committee submitted a list of questions to each firm, and asked them to address the questions in their second submission. Each firm was also asked to discuss possible design alternatives. In July 2003, the design committee selected Michael Vergason Landscape Architects as the memorial designer. The DVLMF Board of Directors affirmed the choice. Vergason's winning design envisioned a plot that formed a right triangle, with the right angle in the southwest corner of the site. Along the sidewalks that formed the legs of the triangle were dense rows of trees. Slightly inward from the right angle was a pentagon-shaped paved area whose tip was aimed at the southwest corner of the site. Within this paved area, two walls formed a partial top of another pentagon, while two walls formed complete sides to it. The base of this shape, which faced northeast, was open to provide a view of the U.S. Capitol. Within the pentagonal area bounded by these walls was a fountain with a pentagon- shaped bowl. Aligned with the base of the paved pentagonal area was the edge of the reflecting pool. Beginning near the tip of the pentagonal paving area were stone walls, approximately high, which extended to the northern and southeastern tips of the site. These walls had rectangular windows in them, and they were inscribed with quotations about democracy, sacrifice, and honor. Paralleling the stone wall, creating a path about in width, were glass walls approximately high on which images of disabled veterans were inscribed. The glass walls were also to carry stories about disabled veterans and quotations from them about the meaning of their military service and the sacrifices they made. The northeastern side of the right triangle site formed the base of a trapezoidal reflecting pool. Its sides were the glass wall, and its top the edge of the paved area. Trees partially lined the northeastern side of the site, with a gap in them to permit views of the Capitol. =Initial design= Original design proposal for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. Vergason's initial design underwent changes before being submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts for approval. It now consisted of five elements. The first was the fountain. The fountain, intended to be the center of the memorial, was still located near the southwestern corner of the site. But instead of pentagonal shaped, the fountain was now a circular granite basin which contained both water and an eternal flame. The flame was about high, and was designed to gout higher during times of war or national emergency. A circular area around the fountain was paved with specially colored stones to emphasize its centrality to the site. The second element were the stone walls and trees. The white, marble-faced stone walls were now called the \\"Walls of Loss\\", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them. Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness (as opposed to being walled in). The west and south sides of the site continued to be lined with trees, but the stone walls no longer connected with the paved area around the fountain. The stone walls were also no longer continuous, so as not to create the sense that the memorial was walled off from the surrounding area. The third element was the triangular reflecting pool, which extended south and east from the fountain, with trees at the north end emerging from the water at seemingly random points. An opening in the grove on the northeast portion of the site still permitted views of the U.S. Capitol. The fourth element was the glass walls. These were moved inward, away from the stone walls, to form trapezoidal paved areas that formed paths guiding the visitor between the various groves of trees. These trapezoidal, paved areas were oriented toward the north, or main, entrance to the memorial. They also created partial walls forcing visitors to use one of the memorial's three entrances. (In addition to the memorial's primary entrance on the north end, entrances existed in the southeast and southwest corners.) The glass walls were now called the \\"Walls of Light\\". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism. The fifth element consisted of the masses of trees around the site. Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to view the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. The memorial also had a flagpole, and Vergason intended for \\"works of art\\" to be placed around the memorial site (although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined). CFA members were, on the whole, positive and enthusiastic about the memorial design, but they also had a number of criticisms. First, the memorial seemed to be merely a collection of elements rather than a unified design. The memorial designers were asked to simply and harmonize the design, and reduce the number of elements if possible. Member Diana Balmori, a landscape architect, made the specific suggestion that the fountain and pool be combined, and the flame placed in the pool. Second, the large number of interior walls on the site created areas that ignored the street alignments which gave the site shape. While the DVLMF believed nearly all visitors would come from the north (with pedestrians coming from the Capitol, United States Botanic Garden, and the National Museum of the American Indian), the CFA questioned this assumption and asked that pedestrian flow be studied. Finally, CFA members thought that raising and lowering the flame would trivialize the memorial, the flagpole should be located in less intrusive place, and that the trees in the reflecting pool would create serious maintenance problems. Nonetheless, the CFA approved the memorial's preliminary design on March 18, 2004. The National Capital Planning Commission approved the preliminary design concept of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial on April 1, 2004. However, the NCPC made three requests of the memorial's planners. First, they asked them to continue to study vehicular movement around the memorial and refine the design and site plot accordingly. Second, they asked the planners to study the ways pedestrians would cross busy Independence Avenue SW, 2nd Street SW, and Washington Avenue SW, and to make design refinements based on these studies. Third, the NCPC asked that the circular holes in the stone walls, which disconcertingly looked like gun ports, be redesigned. =First revised design= The first revised design for the memorial. A revised design was submitted to the CFA as well as to the NCPC in June 2005. In the revised design, the fountain was now a simple basin (without water jets) in the shape of a star, with the eternal flame at its center. A thin scrim of water surrounded the flame, making it appear as if the fire were emerging from the water itself. The northeastern sides and arms of the star spilled water over into a reflecting pool. Extending northwest and southeast from the star-shaped basin was a triangular reflecting pool whose long edge bordered Washington Avenue. Both the star-shaped basin and the reflecting pool were intended to be of black granite. Both the basin and the reflecting pool were designed to have as little rippling water as possible, so as best to reflect both the eternal flame and the Capitol building. Trees lined the edges of the reflecting pool, except for an opening on the northeast portion of the site (which permitted views of the U.S. Capitol). The length of the stone and glass walls was now much reduced, and they were set near the trees on the western and southern edges of the site. The memorial's primary entrance was still considered to be on the north end, but stone walls came close together in the southwest corner of the site to create a major secondary entrance. The white marble-faced stone walls were called the \\"Walls of Loss\\", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them. Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness rather than being walled off. The glass walls were called the \\"Walls of Light\\". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism. Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. Vergason also intended for \\"works of art\\" to be placed around the memorial site, although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined. The revised design still returned C Street SW to its original configuration in the L'Enfant Plan. All steps and grade changes were eliminated and special-needs parking along C Street SW increased to make the memorial more handicapped-accessible. The CFA received an update on this first revision in July 2005. The DVLMF had hired sculptor Larry Kirkland as the designer of the artworks, and Vergason emphasized strongly that Kirkland was very much a member of the design team. These artworks were to be bronze panels, tall, Neoclassical in style but with some abstraction, and life-size human bodies with missing limbs. Each panel featured a counter-relief image of a human body, each missing one or more limbs. Sample panels included full human bodies, headless bodies, and single body parts. One statue would be female. Three of the sculptures would be associated with the eastern wall and one with the north wall, be placed between the glass walls (which were envisioned to be in height) and the taller marble-clad walls. The DVLMF had also contracted with Kirkland to assist with the inscriptions on the glass and stone walls. Kirkland reported that the northern wall was intended to express gratitude toward disabled veterans, while the eastern wall would provide quotations from disabled veterans themselves. More than 700 quotations had been collected, he said. Although no quotations had yet been selected, the designers were mindful of picking text that related to the statues. Each glass wall would consist of five layers of glass, laminated together. Quotations would be inscribed on an inner layer, so that the exterior remained smooth. Inscriptions would be placed at different layers at different points within the wall, and the number and grouping of quotations would be varied. Both elements would help to achieve a diverse appearance. CFA members generally applauded the revisions and were positive about Kirkland's preliminary statue and glass wall designs. But they emphasized that the memorial still lacked a hierarchy of design and was too complex. \\"There were too many elements ‚Äì fire, a star, water, two kinds of walls, writing, sculpture, landscaping ‚Äì but there was no clear hierarchy,\\" said one member of the CFA. =Second revised design= The first revised design was being tweaked in March 2006 when a major design change occurred. Because of concerns expressed by the Architect of the Capitol and the United States Capitol Police that a realigned C Street SW might provide an easy route for a truck bomb to be used against one of the House of Representatives' office buildings, C Street was now designed to dead-end at 2nd Street SW. This radically altered the site's southern boundary, extending it southward and forcing a reconsideration of the memorial's entire design. However, since a portion of the site was also given to the Architect of the Capitol, the site's size was reduced to just . The second revised design was submitted to the CFA in November 2006. This new design moved the five-pointed star-shaped basin to the northern tip of the site. The eternal flame remained at the center of the basin. To provide an unobstructed view of the Capitol, no trees would line the northern half of the northeastern side of the site. The stone walls were reduced so that they now only occurred in two long sections on the western side of the site, and a pedestrian walkway was added in the much-expanded southern grove of trees to allow office workers to move through the site. To maintain handicapped-accessibility, the new plan widened 2nd Street NW and added a lane nearest the memorial for bus and special-needs parking. The range of quotations on the stone wall were now limited only to expressions of loss and the nation's gratitude. Because of the diminution of the screening walls and a more limited number of trees, which reduced traffic noise, the star- shaped basin was now raised to a height of about . A cascade of water high led from the basin to the tree-lined reflecting pool. This cascade, it was hoped, would make white noise which would reduce the intrusiveness of the traffic noises. The reflecting pool was now capable of being drained quickly to be used as a platform for events, rallies, or commemorations. Changes were made to the glass walls as well, which were now scattered in the larger grove of trees on the southern portion of the site. Vergason said that the glass panels (confirmed to be high) would reflect the trees and visitors reading their inscriptions. The bronze panels were reduced in number to four, each one depicting the silhouette of a veteran with missing body parts. Addressing landscape concerns, Vergason said the large, southern grove of trees would consist of ginkgo, with bald cypress along 2nd Street. Disease-resistant American elms would be planted in a double-row along Washington Avenue. Vergason confirmed that grey granite would be used for the plaza, and black granite for the bottom of the basin and pool. Lighting would be provided by standard CFA-approved single-globe or double-globe lighting standards. Spotlights on poles would illuminate the bronze sculptural panels, and the glass panels would be lit from behind and below by ground lamps. Some elements were still in flux, however. Ground plantings had not been selected yet, and the depth of the reflecting pool and the direction of its water flow were undecided. Also not yet finalized were how to handle the water features in winter. The National Park Service wished to drain both water elements, but memorial planners were hoping to maintain a low level of water in the star- shaped basin year-round. The height and style of the reflecting pool's edge was also unclear, as it depended on the direction of the water flow and other details. Among the designs being considered were a low, flat edge which could serve as seating; a low, angled edge which discouraged seating; and no edge, in which case the reflecting pool would be nearly level with the plaza. The design of benches, and their placement, was also still under discussion. Although the Commission of Fine Arts still expressed some concerns with the memorial's design, it approved the second revised concept on November 16, 2006. The National Capital Planning Commission approved the second revised concept on November 30, 2006. The NCPC expressed concern that the water features either provide for year-round operation or be aesthetically pleasing when drained. The group also asked the memorial planners to consider not just physically handicapped individuals but also those with visual and hearing impairments when designing the memorial's accessibility features. These elements should not be added later, but incorporated into the design, NCPC members stressed. Finally, the agency expressed its ongoing concern over pedestrian access. =Third revised design= Both the CFA and NCPC still needed to give their final approval to the design, however. The third revised design was presented to the Commission of Fine Arts on July 17, 2008. Two firms had been hired by the memorial planners to assist the design team: Fluidity Design Consultants, which helped with the design of the star-shaped fountain; and Cloud Gehshan Associates, which worked on the glass panels and artworks. The first major change to the memorial design involved the star- shaped basin, which no longer overflowed into the triangular reflecting pool. Now the fountain overflowed itself, with water passing down its sides into a trough at the base of the structure. The overflow was designed to be a quiet one. The basin's underlying stone was no longer black granite, but the same grey granite as the rest of the plaza. The height of the star-shaped basin was also raised to above the plaza, to make it a more visible and dramatic part of the memorial's design. (The height of the fountain permitted someone in a wheelchair to see the flame, but was also high enough to discourage a person from climbing into the water and approaching the flame.) The fountain was designed to be turned off in winter, although the basin would not be drained. A sensor system would detect if anyone climbed into the fountain's basin, and turn off the flame as a protective measure. The nature of the eternal flame had also been further refined. The new plan called for five stones to protrude slightly above the water. Just out of sight below the surface of the water, jets would allow natural gas to bubble to the surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, igniters hidden in the stones would cause the gas to burst into a high flame. Sensors would adjust the flow of gas and the operation of the igniters to accommodate weather (such as wind or rain). The second major change to the memorial's design involved the glass walls and bronze artwork. Placed on the northern edge of the southern gingko tree grove, these four freestanding glass walls‚Äînow called \\"Voices of Veterans\\"‚Äîwould not only contain quotations and other inscriptions but also photo-realistic images of disabled veterans. Each glass \\"wall\\" consisted of 17 or 18 panels, with each panel wide, high, and thick. A gap between each panel permitted the movement of air. About 30 quotations would be used. The images would depict disabled veterans from the American Civil War to the present, although the quotations extended back to the American Revolutionary War. The number of rectangular bronze panels now numbered five, and they were to be placed behind some of the glass walls. These artworks passed light through to the glass walls as well as helped create a stronger visual element than glass alone. Trees in the grove would have their limbs removed up to a height of about to provide visibility, and a planting bed about deep behind the glass panels would discourage anyone from approaching them from behind. Kirkland said that as the bronze panels evolved, both veterans and DVLMF board members began questioning whether they effectively depicted the experiences of disabled veterans. It became clear that a more photo-realistic approach was needed, but this could only be accommodated by the glass panels. The designers realized that glass panels with only quotations was not dynamic enough, and that the bronze elements would help present the idealized elements that the photo-realistic images could not. Several small changes were also made to the rest of the memorial. The overall size of the reflecting pool was reduced to just in length. The height of the pool was raised so it was about off the ground, which gave the pool a more \\"honorific\\" quality. The reflecting pool was designed to be drained in winter, leaving a flat expanse of stone. The \\"Walls of Loss\\" was now called the \\"Wall of Gratitude\\", and designers said it would be high. The northern segment of this wall would not only contain the name of the memorial, but also include several quotations and the seals of each branch of the armed services as well. The CFA requested a site visit to see in-place mock-ups for the stone and glass walls and their lighting. The effectiveness of the photo- realistic elements were questioned by some members of the CFA, who pointed out that they created a time-bound (rather than timeless) memorial and had proven ineffective at the Korean War Veterans Memorial. Several commissioners also expressed very strong concern over the significant changes in the bronze panels. But CFA chair Earl A. Powell III (himself a Vietnam War veteran) strongly endorsed it, which appeared to mute these concerns. United States Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gordon H. Mansfield, a Vietnam War veteran who was paralyzed in combat, spoke movingly before the CFA in favor of the revised bronzes. Mansfield's testimony, given as a paralyzed individual and not in an official capacity, also helped to win over the CFA. The CFA also asked that the designers study the spacing and placement of the glass panels, the size of the gap between the two segments of the stone wall, and whether the stone wall might be broke into three or more sections. Commission members noted that the spotlights on poles might be eliminated, suggesting that light from surrounding buildings and street lights made them unnecessary. They requested a nighttime lighting study from the memorial planners to help decide the issue. The Commission approved the third revised concept on July 17, 2008. =Final design= National Capital Planning Commission architectural drawing of the layout of the memorial's final design. As requested, the DVLMF manufactured mock-ups of the glass and bronze panels. The site visit was held in early March 2009. Mock-ups of the glass panels were placed in their planned locations, and various sticks and flags indicated the position and height of other memorial elements. CFA members made minor suggestions regarding the opacity of the lettering and the typography on the glass panels, and expressed ongoing concern about the site's accessibility. Commission members also asked that the memorial planners to study whether the \\"Wall of Gratitude\\" was so high as to block views of the U.S. Capitol from points east, to consider widening the pedestrian access points in the wall, and to reduce further the size of the reflecting pool. Another site visit, with more details about the water elements and lighting scheme, was planned. The second site visit was held in May 2009. The memorial's designers had once more reduced the size of the reflecting pool and also widened the walkways and access points. Commission members stressed that art was more important than the quotations on the glass panels, and made two suggestions: First, that more images be added, and second, that the images be made more complex to heighten their impact. The memorial planners discussed the \\"Wall of Gratitude\\" height study and the nighttime ambient street lighting study with the commission. The decision was made to limit the wall's height to , and to eliminate the pole lights. The members of the CFA said they believed that, pending resolution of these issues, the memorial was ready for final approval, and requested a final design approval submission (complete with a description of all materials and plantings as well as material samples). The Commission of Fine Arts reviewed the final site design on July 16, 2009. A nearly complete mockup of the artwork was prepared and viewed by the commissioners prior to the meeting. The commission was extremely pleased with the final site plan and made a single minor suggestion (ensure even distribution of illumination along the Wall of Gratitude). CFA staff were delegated to work with the memorial planners on final details. In its last action regarding the memorial, the Commission of Fine Arts approved the final design. The final design was then submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission on June 24, 2010. By this time, the southernmost glass wall had been eliminated to provide for better east-west pedestrian flow through the site (leaving the memorial with just three glass panels). The placement of the remaining glass walls was adjusted, and the number of glass panels reduced from 70 to 49. Per the request of the Commission of Fine Arts, the height of the \\"Wall of Gratitude\\" was reduced from to . At the request of the National Park Service, this wall was now composed of granite, which was more durable than marble. The American elms planned for Washington Avenue were replaced with gingko, and the pole-mounted lights and ground-level lighting for the glass panels eliminated. Small LED lights were added to the top and back of each glass panel, and LED lights were used to underlight each granite bench. Accessibility elements for special- needs individuals were also incorporated into the submitted final design. All crosswalks now had tactile paving and audible crosswalk signals. Seating height within the memorial was adjusted to be more accessible to the physically impaired, and the memorial planners had reached an agreement with the Architect of the Capitol to provide special needs parking south of the memorial site. To assist those who were visually impaired, the memorial now also provided an audio tour, accessed for free via cell phone, which described the memorial's art and components and provided an interpretive description of them. On July 1, 2010, the National Capital Planning Commission gave its approval to the memorial's final site design. Dedication The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial was dedicated on October 5, 2014. President Barack Obama addressed a crowd of about 3,100 visitors and guests, many of them disabled veterans, who witnessed the memorial's unveiling. \\"In the United States of America, those who have fought for our freedom should never be shunned and should never be forgotten,\\" Obama said. \\"When our wounded veterans set out on that long road of recovery, we need to move heaven and earth to make sure they get every single benefit, every single bit of care that they have earned, that they deserve.\\" Also in attendance at the event was Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald and Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. Actor Gary Sinise spoke at the event as national spokesperson for the memorial foundation. Speaking to the crowd, McDonald said, \\"Few have given more to America. This imposing memorial stands as a powerful reminder of their service and their sacrifice.\\" About the memorial The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial is located on a parcel of land (roughly in the shape of a right triangle) bounded by 2nd Street SW, Washington Avenue SW, and the on-ramps from both streets to I-395. The site is adjacent to and east of the Hubert H. Humphrey Building, headquarters of the United States Department of Health and Human Services; adjacent to and northeast of the Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Federal Building; and southeast and adjacent to the Bartholdi Fountain portion of the grounds of the United States Botanic Garden. The site is federally owned, and under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service. The memorial was designed by Michael Vergason of Michael Vergason Landscape Architects, with sculptor Larry Kirkland consulting. Architectural services were supplied by Shalom Baranes Associates, and engineering services by RK&K; Engineers. Technical assistance for the fountain and reflecting pool were provided by Fluidity, Inc. Technical assistance in graphic design was provided by Cloud Gehshan Associates, and consultant Claude Engle assisted with the lighting design. The memorial consists of five elements: *The first element is a fountain in the shape of a five-pointed star, in height and set on the northern end of the site. The fountain is clad in a nearly black granite known as St. John's Black. Water in the basin overflows the sides of the fountain, and is collected in a small trough at the base of the structure. In the center of the fountain is an eternal flame. Jets below the surface of the water generate bubbles of natural gas, which rise to the surface. Two igniters, hidden among five decorative stones which just break the surface, ignite the gas, which rises to a flame about high (although this varies due to weather). Sensors monitor the flame to ensure a smooth flow of gas and that the igniters function properly. Pressure sensors in the basin automatically stop the flow of gas should anyone attempt to climb into the fountain. The system is monitored and controlled remotely via the Internet, allowing both the operator (the National Park Service) and the fabricator (Technifex) to operate the system. The fountain is designed to remain filled but not overflow during winter months. *The second element is a reflecting pool which extends south and southeast from the star-shaped fountain. The reflecting pool rises from the plaza and is also made of St. John's Black granite. The memorial is designed so the water in both the fountain and the reflecting pool reflect the nearby United States Capitol building. *The third element is a \\"Wall of Gratitude\\", which consists of two long, walls of reinforced concrete clad in an almost pure white granite known as Bethel White (quarried near Bethel, Vermont). This wall extends along the western wide of the site, and inscriptions are carved into the east face of both segments. On the northern segment are quotations from General George Washington and General Dwight Eisenhower, and the name of the memorial. Quotations expressing gratitude for the sacrifices of disabled veterans are inscribed on the southern segment of the wall. A passage between the two segments is cut so that it orients visitors toward the Capitol dome. *The fourth element is the \\"Voices of Veterans\\" area, which forms the southern portion of the site. This exhibit consists of three staggered glass walls consisting of a total of 49 panels. Each panel is high, wide, and thick; weighs ; and consists of five sheets of Starphire glass laminated together. On the interior sheets of glass are inscribed photo-realistic images of veterans and quotations from veterans describing their devotion to duty, what it was like to be wounded, and how they came to terms with their disability. Four bronze panels, with silhouettes of soldiers cut from their center, stand behind some of the glass panels. The four bronze panels feature a saluting soldier in full dress uniform, a soldier rescuing a wounded comrade (who is slung over his shoulders), a running soldier bowed beneath a full pack, and a soldier with an amputated leg using crutches to hold himself upright. *The fifth element consists of a grove of memorial trees. The \\"Voices of Veterans\\" element is set among the trees of the northern part of this grove. A pedestrian walkway passes through the grove south of the \\"Voices of Veterans\\", to give local workers a means of passing through the site. Landscaping elements form an integral part of the memorial design. A row of gingko trees lines the side of the site west of the \\"Wall of Gratitude\\", as well as both sides of the wide sidewalk on the Washington Avenue side of the site. Planting beds approximately deep exist behind each glass wall. Ground cover consists of mondo grass and lily turf. Shrubs used at the site include Carolina allspice (Calycanthus floridus), dwarf sweet pepperbush, Harry's garnet sweetspire, \\"Gulftide\\" holly osmanthus, and Burkwood viburnum. Perennial plantings at the site include marginal wood fern, autumn fern, lenten rose (Helleborus orientalis), Virginia bluebell, and woodland sedge. Most of the memorial is paved using a type of gray granite known in the stone trade as Virginia Mist. All paving stones have been treated with a thermal coating to help them resist weatherization. Perimeter lighting along city sidewalks bordering the site is provided by standard single- or double-globe D.C. standard streetlights. Metal halide lights illuminate the eastern side of the \\"Wall of Gratitude\\", the flagpole, and the memorial grove. LED lights are used to backlight each glass wall, and for under-lighting the granite benches at the site. The Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation raised the funds for, oversaw the design of, and constructed the memorial. After the memorial is dedicated, the memorial will become the property of the U.S. federal government and will be administered by the National Park Service.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is also known as St Michael's Rectory. History The building was originally a town house, but in 1659, soon after it was built, it was bequeathed to the parish of St Michael for use as a rectory. It ceased to be used as a rectory in 1907, and was converted into a shop by an antique dealer named Crawford. It was restored in the late 20th century. Architecture Constructed in timber framing with plaster panels, the shop has a grey slate roof. It has four storeys, and consists of a single, narrow bay. A portion of the Chester Rows passes through the first floor. At street level is a modern shop front, behind which is the former undercroft. At the front of the first floor is a rail on balusters, behind which is a stallboard, the paved walkway of the Row, and a modern shop front. Above this is a row of five ornately shaped panels. The second floor contains a three-light mullioned and transomed casement window, with two panels on each side. The top storey is jettied and gabled. It contains a row of six plain panels, above which is a small three-light casement window with two panels on each side, and a queen post gable with patterned bargeboards and a finial. The interior has retained part of a 17th-century moulded ceiling, the form of the galleried former great hall, and an 18th-century staircase. In also contains four panels depicting the Stations of the Cross. These appear to be medieval, but are in fact plaster panels painted to resemble wood that were installed by Crawford when the rectory was converted into a shop.

Sergius then began his own piano study at the age of nine and soon entered the St. Petersburg Conservatory. But in 1920 his family fled the Revolution, moving to Berlin, and a year later he studied with Leonid Kreutzer and Paul Juon at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik.Baker's Biographical Dictionary, p. 878 He and his family moved again, to the United States in 1925, and in 1930 he entered the Juilliard School in New York city, studying with piano with Carl Friedberg, composition with Rubin Goldmark and singing with Marcella Sembrich, and earned his diploma in 1934. After Sembrich's death in 1935, he took over the training of many of her students, and he formally joined the faculty at Juilliard in 1940. There he taught singing and vocal literature from 1940 to 1964, and at the Union Theological Seminary, from 1957 also until his death. He married soprano Genevieve Greer in 1937. He became an American citizen in 1930. He became influential and important to the field of singing and voice pedagogy through his own teaching, as well as his writings and editions of a wide variety of vocal works. One of his students at Juilliard was the important American mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani. As a pianist, he specialized in accompanying singers, especially important artists such as Povla Frijsh, Ezio Pinza and Mack Harrell. In the late 1940s he appeared with the newly formed Bach Aria Group, an ensemble of singers and instrumentalists that presents the works of J. S. Bach. Music and writing He began his work as a composer later in life, after 1949.Villamil, p. 248 He wrote somewhere between 50 and 70 songs, and about 20 of them were published.Villamil, p. 249 They are written in a chromatic idiom with careful attention to text declamation. His three-act opera Hamlet, in a lyrical style ranging from tonal to 12-note, was first performed in Baltimore on 9 November 1962. A second opera, The Suitor (based on Moli√®re‚Äôs Monsieur de Pourceaugnac), was never completed. As an editor, he prepared 39 volumes of songs and arias for the International Music Company. These editions cover a wide range of historical eras and vocal styles: opera arias, Baroque works by Purcell, Handel, and Scarlatti, German Lieder by most of the important composers, and many French m√©lodies by both familiar and less-familiar composers. As a writer on singing, he published his important catalog of vocal literature Music for the Voice in 1949. A year later he wrote a second book for voice teachers, On Studying Singing. These books and musical editions are still in print and are still widely used by American singers and voice teachers today. Kagen died in New York, New York.

Protesters set up camp at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama and continued until March.

Death On April 2, 2011 Al-Ashiri was arrested and charged with providing false news, inciting hatred towards the regime and calling for an overthrow of the government.

Photos later surfaced of Al-Ashiri's corpse, which displayed cuts and gashes, and added further evidence that Al-Ashiri had been beaten to death. As a result, the Committee to Protect Journalists called on Bahraini authorities to conduct a thorough investigation on his death.

Two policemen are accused of the death beating and could be sentenced to up to seven years in prison. Reactions In response to his death, the Newseum in Washington, D.C. will be adding his name along with other journalists who have died while reporting to the Journalists Memorial Wall.

While Savannah's minor league teams sported at least ten nicknames during the century, the predominant nickname was the Savannah Indians, which was used for 27 seasons (1906‚Äì1912; 1926‚Äì1928; 1936‚Äì1942; 1946‚Äì1954; 1970).

In 1955‚Äì1960, 1962, and from 1968‚Äì1995, the Savannah team was named after its Major League parent. After 1926, the club played at Grayson Stadium. For much of their existence, the Indians played in what is now the Double-A Southern League, known before 1964 as the original South Atlantic (\\"Sally\\") League. In 1926‚Äì1928, they competed in the Southeastern League. The Sally League franchise was founded as the Pathfinders in 1904 and dubbed the Colts from 1913‚Äì1915. From 1971‚Äì1983, Savannah's Southern League team was called the Savannah Braves, reflecting its link to the Atlanta Braves' organization. When this franchise relocated to Greenville in 1984, it was replaced by the Savannah Cardinals of the contemporary Single-A South Atlantic League; the Savannah team, known as the Savannah Sand Gnats since 1996, moved to Columbia, South Carolina in 2016, and was in turn replaced by a new, independent franchise, the Savannah Bananas.

Kromer lost many hats to the wind while working on trains, and in 1903 he asked his wife Ida (1877-1960) to make him a warm hat that would stay on more securely. She modified a baseball capWisconsin life into what became the Stormy Kromer cap by sewing on a pair of ear flaps.

In 1919, due to ever increasing demand, the Kromers opened a factory in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. George Kromer sold the company in 1965 to Richard Grossman. In 2001, the Kromer Cap Company planned to cease production of Stormy Kromer caps. The rights to the caps were purchased by Bob Jacquart, owner of Jacquart Fabric Products, and production moved to Ironwood, Michigan.

Background  Brockhausen was born in Fredericia, Denmark on May 20, 1858. He attended public schools and became a journeyman cigar maker in 1877. While working on the German island of F√∂hr in North Frisia, he joined both the Social Democratic Party and the cigarmakers' union. He migrated to the United States in 1879, and to Milwaukee soon after; but later spent some time in New York, Iowa, Montana, Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and St. Paul, Minnesota, before finally settling permanently in Milwaukee in 1894. He joined the Cigar Makers' International Union in 1890 while working in St. Paul, and in 1897, after participating in the People's Party during the 1896 election, joined the Milwaukee branch of the Social Democracy of America. He was an associate of fellow Socialist Frank J. Weber in the early years of the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor, and served as its unpaid secretary-treasurer from 1900‚Äì1912; the Wisconsin Historical Society's Dictionary of Wisconsin History describes him as \\"in effect, its executive officer and legislative representative\\".\\"Brockhausen, Frederick Carl Jr. 1858 - 1929\\" Dictionary of Wisconsin History Wisconsin Historical Society; accessed November 1, 2011 In 1903 he was among the leaders of the push for worker's compensation: statutory recognition of an injured worker's right to compensation without court action.  Legislative service  He was first elected to the Assembly from Milwaukee County's 11th Assembly district (the 11th Ward of the City of Milwaukee) in 1904, defeating former Assemblyman Republican Herman Pomrening by 9 votes in a three-way race, with 1924 votes for Brockhausen, 1915 for Pomrening, and 1163 for Democrat Charles Miksch. (Democratic incumbent Frank Haderer, who had ousted Pomrening in 1902, was not a candidate.) Brockhausen was assigned to the standing committee on manufactures.Erickson, Halford, ed.

The blue book of the state of Wisconsin Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1907; pp. 627, 645, 1088, 1162 In 1908, with no Republican in the race, he defeated Miksch 1575 to 1288, and moved to the committee on municipalities.Beck, J.

After the Assembly  In 1912, his Assembly district had been merged with part of that represented by fellow Socialist James Vint. Rather than run against Vint (who won re-election) he ran for the Wisconsin State Senate, losing to Democrat Alexander E. Martin by a narrow margin in a five-way race. After his loss, he relinquished his union and party responsibilities to devote his time to his cigar business, but retained his Socialist and labor zeal. In 1916 he ran again for the Assembly's 14th Milwaukee County district, losing by 29 votes to Democrat Thomas Szewczykowski.The Wisconsin blue book, 1917 Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1917; pp. 297, 491 He served on the State Council of Defense (chairman of its labor committee) during World War I, and on the board of trustees of the Milwaukee County Institutions (1921‚Äì1929).

Barcoding blood and other products may allow for reduction of medical error and increase patient safety.

(2006). \\"Bar Code Requirements for Blood Banks.\\" Retrieved from https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/NewsEvents/WorkshopsMeetingsConferences/ucm113326.htm This is used to minimize the risk of patients receiving the wrong treatment in healthcare facilities. According to the FDA, a minimum of four information pieces are required for the label, which includes the following: * Unique identifier for the facility from where the blood is coming from; * Lot number identifying blood donor; * Product code; and * Blood type (ABO,O,A and Rh). =Surgical Instrument Identification & Sterilization= Barcodes may be used to identify the instruments and supplies in kits for surgical procedures. Barcodes on instruments and surgical kits may be used to ensure compliance with surgeons' preferences for what their kits contains. Using barcodes to track what is and what is not used on a regular basis may allow for hospitals to optimize kit contents for each surgeon. This provides opportunities to reduce costs since surgeons' preferences may change over time.Nicolaos, G., Tournoud, M., Hassani, Y., Mignon, J., Fr√©mont, F., & Fabrequette, A. (2009). \\"Unique device identification of surgical instruments by DataMatrix 2D barcodes.\\" [Case Study]. GSI Healthcare Reference Book, 1-3. With the lack of updates to kit and cart contents, it may result in the purchase of supplies that are never used. Barcodes on surgical instruments can also be used to uniquely identify each instrument that is sterilized individually.Flynn, S. (2007). Documenting the steam sterilization process. Healthcare Purchasing News, 31(1), 50. =Patient Identification= Barcode technology can help prevent medical errors by making accurate and reliable information readily available at the point-of-care. Information, such as the drug identification, medication management, infusion safety, specimen collection, etc. and any other patient care activity can be easily tracked during the patient stay. Wristbands with barcodes that contain the information of the patient's medical record or visit number, and any other identifiers have been proven effective to provide proper patient care.Niceware International.

However, there are concerns with the use improper of barcoding technology in healthcare. * From a technological standpoint, linear barcodes (1-D symbologies) have their limitations with regards to their size, memory capacity to store data, and standards that are put in place (e.g. the 10-digit National Drug Code). * There is an escape with 2-D symbologies providing smaller barcodes for healthcare materials and tools or with a larger amount of data stored on them.HIMSS10 NewsWire (2010). ‚ÄúeMix Presents Cloud Technology for Image Sharing,‚Äù Healthcare IT News, 23 February 2010. Retrieved on 12 July 2010. As a result, there has been a lot of attention on the use of two dimensional barcode labels. * However, older models of barcode scanners that exist in the healthcare setting today are unable to read reduced space symbology, RSS composite, or two dimensional symbologies. * The simple fact is that recent models of smart phones are capable to read all known barcodes using respective applications. Looking at barcoding technology in healthcare from a clinical professional standpoint * Barcoding technology shall impact the workflow process positively.Poon, E.G., et al.

(2003). \\"Barcoding makes its mark on daily practice.\\" [Electronic Version]. Journal of Nursing Administration, 33, 18-20. The stated concerns of 2003, as e.g. *Formalizing clinical professional autonomy to document decisions; *Support is too slow to respond in clinical routine, especially emergencies; *Software limits in flexibility with dosing orders; *Sequencing the monitored medication delivery window and prioritizing other patient care activities; *Equipment problems such as missing armbands, illegible barcodes, and others summarized as insufficient data quality All concerns may be traced to inadequate methods or insufficient tools with a non covered demand for support by modern information technologies. Actualized decision making in 2016 for equipping the mobile work serves to overcome limitations originated from legacy equipment. Future of Barcoding in Healthcare Given barcoding's history as a mature reliable technology, barcoding will continue to be adopted within the healthcare setting to improve the quality of patient care. However, growing attention on radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems are expected to be the future competitor for barcoding. Nevertheless, barcoding will continue to play a prominent role with RFID and will likely collaborate with RFID to form a hybrid system.Health Industry Business Communications Council (HIBCC). \\"Radio frequency identification (RFID) in healthcare.\\" [White Paper]. Retrieved from http://www.hibcc.org/PUBS/WhitePapers/RFID%20in%20Healthcare.pdf In this regard, barcoding (1-D and 2-D) will continue to have advantages over RFID (specifically passive RFID) for the following two reasons:Dzik, S. (2007). \\"Radio frequency identification for prevention of bedside errors.\\" [Electronic Version]. Transfusion. 47(s2), 125S-129S. *Barcoding is cheaper than RFID (passive RFID must lower its price to become competitive); *Barcode technology is ideally suited for tasks in which a human being is stationary and objects are moving (e.g. blood sample collection and labeling). Barcoding technology in healthcare will eventually begin to shift over to the use of 2-D symbologies to accommodate size restrictions and the growing need for large amounts of data. This is already becoming a reality with the use of mobile phones and is bound to play an important role in the development of mHealth.

A native of Transylvania region and a veteran of World War I, he is best known for taking the only photographs of the Great National Assembly at Alba Iulia that proclaimed the Union of Transylvania with Romania on December 1, 1918. The day is celebrated as Romania's national holiday, and, with time, M√¢rza's images acquired political and documentary significance. Biography Born to peasant parents »òtefan and Ana in Galtiu village, S√¢ntimbru Commune, Alba County, M√¢rza attended a Greek-Catholic primary school in the village and high school in Alba Iulia. \\"SamoilƒÉ M√¢rza\\" at the Lucian Blaga Alba County Library site; accessed November 1, 2011 \\"Pozele Unirii\\" (\\"The Pictures of the Union\\"), Evenimentul Zilei, December 1, 2007; accessed November 1, 2011 Cristina Diac, \\"Fotograful Marii Uniri\\" (\\"The Photographer of the Great Union\\"), Jurnalul Na≈£ional, November 25, 2008; accessed November 1, 2011 Between 1909 and 1911, his parents sent him as apprentice to a photographer in Sibiu, where he learned the profession. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was mobilized and sent into battle as a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army, where he served first on the Austrian front in Galicia, reaching as far north as Riga, before being transferred to the Italian Front in 1916. As part of the army's topographic and photographic service for over three years, he took pictures of fighting soldiers and scenes of the war's devastation, likely making him the first Romanian war photographer. As the war drew to a close in late 1918, M√¢rza was in Trieste, whence he left for Vienna together with many other Transylvanian Romanian soldiers. He arrived there in early November, planning to head home. That month in the Austrian capital, he took three pictures depicting the blessing of the first tricolor flag belonging to the Central National Romanian Council, in the presence of General Ioan Boieriu, of political leader Iuliu Maniu and the assembled troops. Together with several thousand soldiers, he returned to Transylvania from Vienna in order to participate at the Alba Iulia assembly. The road through Budapest and Arad was blocked by Hungarian forces hostile to the Council, so they went instead via Zagreb, Belgrade and Timi»ôoara, where Serbian forces allowed them to pass provided they were disarmed. The Great National Assembly at Alba Iulia proclaimed the Union of Transylvania with Romania on December 1.Irina Livezeanu, Cultural Politics in Greater Romania, p.132. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 2000. That morning, M√¢rza took three pictures of his fellow villagers before heading for the city. Arriving with a delegation from Galtiu around 11 a.m. on a cloudy day, he carried his camera, then about fifteen years old, Dorin Timonea, \\"Povestea soldatului rom√¢n din armata austro-ungarƒÉ ajuns fotograful Unirii de la 1918\\" (\\"Story of the Romanian Soldier from the Austro-Hungarian Army Who Became the Photographer of the 1918 Union\\"), AdevƒÉrul, November 30, 2012; accessed December 1, 2012 in a sheepskin bag, his tripod and glass plates on a bicycle. Not being accredited, he was not admitted into the hall where the act of union was signed, and the photographer hired for the occasion did not show up. (According to local legend, he was an ethnic Hungarian who did not wish to participate at the event.) Despite the bad weather and the difficulty of using the camera, M√¢rza managed to take five pictures of the assembly. Three showed the assembled crowds, and the other two the podium from which the act was read in public by the politician Aurel Vlad and the Greek-Catholic Bishop Iuliu Hossu. These are the only pictures of the assembly. That day, he took fourteen pictures in all; he later explained that he was unable to take more because the glass plates were expensive and heavy, and the poor light required people to stand still for his shots. At the beginning of 1919, he included the pictures in an album called Marea Adunare de la Alba Iulia √Æn chipuri (\\"The Great Assembly at Alba Iulia in Pictures\\"), mentioned in the newspaper Alba Iulia on March 10. This album was presented by the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and during negotiations on the Treaty of Trianon as part of its attempt to justify the country's incorporation of Transylvania, stating the pictures indicated ethnic Romanians' self-determination to unite with Romania. Other copies were sent to leading figures such as King Ferdinand, Prime Minister Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, Maniu (by then president of the Directing Council of Transylvania) and General Henri Mathias Berthelot. The album met with appreciation, including from Nicolae Iorga, who made a note of receiving it in his diary. Copies of the pictures were also owned by numerous peasant households in the vicinity of Alba Iulia. M√¢rza continued to travel around his county and further afield in Transylvania on his bicycle, photographing other patriotic events, including the 1919 visit of King Ferdinand to Alba Iulia, Abrud and C√¢mpeni; the October 1922 coronation of Ferdinand and Queen Marie at Alba Iulia; the 1924 celebrations at ≈¢ebea marking the centenary of Avram Iancu's birth; and the 1929 festivities at Alba Iulia marking a decade of union, where he was decorated by officials. His photographs included both dignitaries and ordinary people in traditional costumes, weddings, baptisms and traditional celebrations. In 1924, following an audience with BrƒÉtianu, he managed to obtain funding for continuing the painting at the Alba Iulia Orthodox Cathedral, which had been abandoned after the coronation in 1922. In 1967, the head of the National Museum of the Union bought from M√¢rza the camera he used and the pictures he took at the assembly. The photographer noted that he had been forced to sell other pictures due to financial need, earning money from the special glass they were made of. He planned to design a new album for 1968 and with funds from the museum purchased a working camera that he intended to use at the upcoming semicentennial. However, he died at the end of 1967 and was buried in Alba Iulia. In 2003, a monument was erected over his grave, a bust of him unveiled in his native village, and a biography published.

History During the Angolan Civil War, Yugoslavia heavily aided the MPLA, providing military supplies, financial aid, and education for Angolan students and diplomatic training in Belgrade.

Each show also features an element of live music, most often hip hop, rap and R&B.; Airing Since the creation on the show Nat & Marie have successfully channelled their brand as a commentator for online culture for Huffington Post and presenters. History Nat & Marie premiered on Ustream on October 21, 2010, starring Anastasia ‚ÄúNat‚Äù Tubanos and Marie Nicola. It focuses on Internet Online Culture, sharing a format that's most often referred to as Internet Aftershow and/or ‚ÄúThe Female Diggnation. While both Nat & Marie were working creatively together for some time, the concept for Nat & Marie began as an entry for \\"Best travel Job Ever\\", an online travel contest. After failing to make the final round for the competition Nat and Marie took a break before launching Nat & Marie as a live- streaming talkshow in October 2010. According to Nat & Marie, prior to the launch of the live-format talkshow, they were actively creating and pitching shows to networks in Canada but the process was slow moving. In the interest of continuing to produce and have controle over their own content, they chose to explore online as the main distribution channel for their show. Format Each episode begins with a cold open of a clip from on online video that was featured in the previous week's \\"Will it Go Viral?\\" segment. The opening clip usually earned the most viewer votes in order to be selected. Following the opening video, the show goes directly into the \\"411 in 140\\" segment where Nat & Marie report online news as if they were tweets. They noted that they \\"can never stop ourselves from going over '140' characters\\" because \\"it (Twitter) works different with voice\\". The \\"411 in 140\\" then ends with the girls saying \\"That's it for the 411 now let's get into it!\\" before the show credits roll. Other Nat & Marie segments include: * \\"The Hot 5\\" a somewhat humorous look at the best/worst the web has to offer, including DIYs, websites, blogs, videos, phone apps, games, etc. * \\"Will it Go Viral?,\\" showing two potentially viral video clips as chosen by both Nat and Marie. Viewers vote for the video they think is more viral by using either #NatVideo or #MarieVideo on Twitter. Voting continues for the week in between shows with the winning clip opening the show. * \\"Trending Topics,\\" a look at what people are talking about and what's trending in different parts of the world, includes hashtags and videos. * A live musical performance in studio with different bands, DJ's, rap artists, etc. Normally perform twice, once after \\"The Hot 5\\" and once to play out the show. * An interview with an online celebrity. Occasionally \\"The Hot 5\\" is followed up with \\"The Not 5\\" on the Nat & Marie tumblr page as a comical antithesis of the content that aired on the show. During each show viewers are invited to interact and be a part of the live broadcast by reaching out to Nat & Marie via their Twitter https://www.twitter.com/natandmarie account or call in using Skype. Viewers are encouraged to call in with questions for guests and thoughts on a \\"Question of the Night\\" (a topical and slightly controversial question related to online culture).

History The area was once located in the suburbs of the seat of the State of Yan of the Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period, hence the town's name. Before the establishment of the People's Republic, the area was administered by Tong County (present-day Tongzhou District), then in 1950 was ceded to Sanhe County; from 1958 to 1961, as part of the greater collectivization of agriculture, it was a part of Hongxing People's Commune (); 1962 saw Hongxing being split into three smaller communes, amongst them Yanjiao itself. Economic reforms led to the abolishing of the commune and the establishment of Yanjiao as a town in March 1983. Geography Yanjiao is located in the extreme western end of Sanhe City and in the northwest of the Sanhe-Xianghe-Dachang exclave of Hebei.

It developed from a small provincial university library into a major research library.East, John W.: A Brief History of the University of Queensland Library, 2006. It was first housed in the Old Government House building of George Street from 1911-1923. From 1923-1948, it was housed in the Art Block of the Central Technical College in George Street, next to the University. In late 1948, the library moved to the new St Lucia campus, residing in the Duhig Building. By 1954, it had already exceeded its capacity. For decades the library suffered from neglect. Some of this was due to the lack of a formal librarian, and other problems were due to the lack of funds during the early decades of the University's history. The early building in George Street was riddled with white ants and borers, and later lack of space. After the move to St Lucia, the Duhig building was expanded in 1964, and smaller libraries sprang up to support Department needs. In 1974, the Duhig building had exceeded its capacity and hence the Central Library was built, under the direction of then University Librarian, Derek Fielding. A four-storey Biological Sciences Library building, to accommodate the growing science collections, was built in 1976. The same year, the Architecture and Music libraries were amalgamated into one place, the Zelman Cowen building, named for the Vice-Chancellor and soon-to-be Governor-General of Australia, Sir Zelman Cowen. The Herston Medical Library was opened in 1984 at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, an amalgamation of many smaller medical libraries. The Physical Sciences and Engineering Library was opened in 1990, and the Law Library gained another floor that same year. After the closure of the Thatcher Memorial Library and Ringrose Libraries in 1993, which specialised in distance education resources, the University acquired the library of the Queensland Agricultural College at Gatton, as part of its amalgamation with the University in 1989. Today the UQ Library is the University of Queensland's network of libraries, encompassing thirteen distinct branches.

There are different types of cajones, namely the caj√≥n tumbadora, the caj√≥n bajo and the cajita, all of which are hand-struck. Cajones arrived to the docks of Matanzas and Havana in the 19th century. They were full of imported fish, mainly cod, but quickly repurposed as drums by the Afro-Cuban dockworkers. The big boxes were the precursors of the modern tumbadora and the small ones corresponded to the modern quinto (the smallest, lead conga drum). The equivalent of claves were two wooden spoons. Although cajones were mostly replaced by tumbadoras by the early 20th century, they are played in contemporary styles such as guarapachangueo.

As a member of the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, Sugar Loaf Farm maintains the only surviving brick grist mill in Augusta County, Virginia. The brick grist mill on the property combines the mechanical principles of Oliver Evans, a prominent mill designer of the late eighteenth century, with the engineering craftsmanship and building detail of molded brick cornices, a vernacular architecture in the upper Shenandoah Valley in the early 1800s. The Farm's three original buildings, the farmhouse, grist mill and miller's house, were all constructed by David Summer at a time when Augusta County had emerged as the center of one of the most dominant wheat-growing and flour-processing regions in the South. Sugar Loaf Farm serves as a valuable reminder of the wheat-based agriculture that persisted in this region well into the twentieth century. Today, Sugar Loaf Farm is a privately run farm that specializes in raising Black Angus cattle.Compiled Plat of the J. Gray Ferguson property, Riverheads District, Augusta County, Virginia. Prepared by R.E. Funk, Land Surveyor. October 19, 2000. Revised January 24, 2001. History Sugar Loaf Farm is named after the distinctive cone-shaped hill on the property that has been a local landmark for centuries. The main portion of Sugar Loaf Farm was owned by John Summers as early as 1773. By 1830, John Summers's son, David, had built the three original buildings‚Äîthe farmhouse, the grist mill and the miller's house. After David Summer's death in 1857, the farm was purchased by Jacob Bowman and remained in the Bowman family until the twentieth century. Since the Bowman ownership, Sugar Loaf Farm has passed through a variety of owners and is currently owned by a large, privately run cattle operation.

The major buildings were constructed within one decade, as parts of a whole. However, changes in family size, architectural tastes, economic markets and agricultural technologies have had a significant impact on the appearance of these structures and on the surrounding landscaping. The property embraces approximately in area, including an area of occupied by the buildings included in the National Register of Historic Places designation; this includes the brick grist mill, miller's house, and stone springhouse. =Brick Grist Mill= Brick gristmill The design of the mill is based on the principles of mill construction developed by Oliver Evans (1755‚Äì1819). Evans was a leading figure of the time is designing alternatives to the overly complex methods for operating water-powered mills. The mills he designed could be operated by one person, using a single continuous production line and can be found in his book, The Young Mill-Wright and Miller's Guide. The brick grist mill on Sugar Loaf Farm is a four-story masonry structure. Each level of the grist mill served a different purpose. Controls for the machinery were located on the first level, the grinding process took place on the second level and sifting and grain storage were located on the third and fourth levels. Very little of the original mill machinery is left in the grist mill, but the original hurst frame, which precisely follows Oliver Evan's design, is still there. =Miller's House= Miller's house The miller's house and the mill have remained relatively original since their construction in the 1820s. The miller house is a two-story home with two rooms on each level, a north exterior chimney and a corbeled cap. In keeping with the architecture of the main farmhouse at the time, the miller's house included decorative brick cornice molding, oak window and doorframes and a hall-parlor floor plan that was similar to the main farmhouse but at a smaller scale. =Stone Springhouse= Stone springhouse The limestone springhouse is located east of the main farmhouse near Eidson Creek, the primary water source of the original enterprise and the controlling utility for the grist mill. The building was probably constructed along with the primary buildings (1820s) as evidenced by the method in which its gable roof rafters and the door and window frames are fashioned after the other primary buildings on the complex.

It sometimes, but not always, relates to a time in a person's retirement after previous service to the public or private sector, opposing \\"active public life\\". Otium can be a temporary time of leisure, that is sporadic. It can have intellectual, virtuous or immoral implications. It originally had the idea of withdrawing from one's daily business (negotium = neg-otium) or affairs to engage in activities that were considered to be artistically valuable or enlightening (i.e. speaking, writing, philosophy). It had particular meaning to businessmen, diplomats, philosophers and poets.Garrison, p. 282 Etymology and origin Representation of ancient Roman soldiers at rest In ancient Roman culture otium was a military concept as its first Latin usage. This was in Ennius' Iphigenia.Andre, pp. 17‚Äì24 According to historian Carl Deroux in his work Studies in Latin literature and Roman history, the word otium appears for the first time in a chorus of Ennius' Iphigenia.Deroux, p. 13 Ennius' first use of the term otium around 190 BC showed the restlessness and boredom during a reprieve from war and was termed otium negotiosum (free time to do what one wanted) and otium otiosum (idle wasteless free time).Leisure, Idleness and Virtuous Activity in Shakespearean Drama by Unhae Langis, p. 2 Aulus Gellius, while discussing the word praeterpropter (\\"more or less\\") quotes a fragment of Ennius's Iphigenia, which contrasts otium with negotium repeatedly.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 19, 10. For this fragment as the first instance of otium in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, \\"Otium as Luxuria: Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's Letters,\\" Arethusa 36 (2003), p. 148. Ennius imagined the emotions of Agamemnon's soldiers at Aulus, that while in the field and not at war and not allowed to go home, as \\"more or less\\" living.Barton, p. 97 The earliest extant appearance of the word in Latin literature occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the Iphigenia of Ennius, where it is contrasted to negotium.Ennius, frg. XCIX in the edition of Jocelyn, otio qui nescit uti  plus negoti habet quam cum est negotium in negotio, rendered by Jocelyn: \\"the man who has no job to do and does not know how to employ the resulting leisure has more difficulty than when there is difficulty in a job on hand\\". For this fragment as the first instance of otium in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, \\"Otium as Luxuria: Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's Letters,\\" Arethusa 36 (2003), p. 148. Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of otium was never a direct translation of the Greek word \\"schole\\", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. Otium is an example of the usage of the term \\"praeterpropter\\", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war.Sadlek, p. 33 In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (i.e., winter months, weather not permitting war). This was associated with otium otiosum (unoccupied and pointless leisure ‚Äì idle leisure). The opposite of this was otium negotiosum (busy leisure) ‚Äì leisure with a satisfying hobby or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was otium privatum (private leisure), equal to negotium (a type of business).\\"Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium\\" by Brian Vickers, p. 6 The first recorded use of the term is in a fragment from a soldiers' chorus in Ennius' Iphigenia (c. 190 BC), whose preservation we owe to that philologian's ragbag, the Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius (c. 150 AD) ‚Äì he cites it as an example of the usage of the word praeterpropter (19.10.12). The soldiers are unoccupied, resting and bored, wanting to return home. They distinguish between otium negotiosum, leisure with a satisfying occupation, which takes place in the city, around the hearth, and otium otiosum, unoccupied and pointless leisure, such as their prolonged stay in the countryside, which they find disorientating. Andre argues that otium originally had military, not pastoral associations, referring to the enforced inactivity that coincided each year with the dead months of winter (especially January and February), unsuitable for war, farming or fishing. The oldest citation for otium is this chorus of soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, in an otherwise lost Latin tragedy by Ennius.Andre, pp. 17‚Äì24, The tragedy is Ennius's Iphigenia, apud Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 19, 10 (a discussion of a different word in the same fragment). Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (otium) than to be idle doing nothing.Andre, p. 17 Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weaponsBernard, p. 16 ‚Äì a time for peace.Bright, p. 217 Even though originally otium was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons,Bright, p. 217 it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for oneself.Stiegler, pp. 53‚Äì54 The ancient Romans had a sense of obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of otium as a waste of time.Andre, pp. 27‚Äì30 Historians of ancient Roman considered otium a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties.Toner, p. 147Paoli, p. 183 Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and Brian Vickers point out the only legitimate form of otium was transpired with intellectual activity.Almasi, p. 115 Otium was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (negotium) and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.Taplin, p. 493  Greek philosophers  Epicurus The favorable sense of otium in Ciceronian Latin reflects the Greek term (skholƒì, \\"leisure\\", a meaning retained in Modern Greek as œÉœáœåŒªŒ∑, sch√≥lƒì); \\"leisure\\" having a complex history in Greek philosophy before being used in Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure was one of the marks of the Athenian gentleman: the time to do things right, unhurried time, time to discuss in. From there it became \\"discussion\\", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. Plato (and his contemporaries, if the Greater Hippias be not authentic) brought schole into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted on both sides of the question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the Greater Hippias, it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the Apology, has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue.Brian Henry Smith, The new nobility: A prolegomenon to Plato's \\"Greater Hippias\\" 2007; pp. 45‚Äì46. However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the Academy, they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the New Academy of Carneades practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.The Academy lasted nearly a thousand years; different authors divide its history differently. For the text, see, inter permulta alia, R.J. Hankinson, The Skeptics, pp. 86‚Äì87. Theophrastus and Dicaearchus, students of Aristotle, debated much on the contemplative life and the active life. Roman Epicureans used otium for the quiet bliss promised by Epicurus.Haase, p. 2265 An Epicurean proverb The phrase \\"to be at ease\\" can have the meaning \\"to be of good cheer\\" or \\"to be without fear\\" these being interdependent. The Epicurean idea of otium favors contemplation,Dillion, p. 48 compassion, gratitude and friendship. The Epicurean view is that wisdom has as much to contribute to the benefit of the public as does that of contributions of politicians and laborers (i.e. sailors). The rustic otium concept incorporates country living into Epicureanism. The active city public life of negotium and an otium of reserved country life of reflection have been much written about by Cicero and Seneca the Younger. Epicurus's philosophy was contrary to Hellenistic Stoicism. Epicurus promised enjoyment in retirement as a concept of otium. The concept of the Epicurean otium (private world of leisure) and the contemplative life were represented in Epicurus' school of philosophy and his garden. The portraits of the Garden of Epicurus near Athens represented political and cultural heroes of the time. Twenty-first‚Äìcentury historians Gregory Warden and David Romano have argued that the layout of the sculptures in \\"The Garden\\" were designed to give the viewer contrasting viewpoints of the Epicurean otium and the Hellenistic Stoic viewpoint of otium (i.e. private or public; contemplation or \\"employment\\"; otium or negotium).Dillon, p. 48  Roman Republic  In early and colloquial Latin, despite the etymological contrast, otium is often used pejoratively, in contrast rather to officium, \\"office, duty\\" than to negotium ('business\\"). There was a difference established in ancient Roman times (second century BCE and forward) developing the idea elite social status was when one fulfilled one's duties in business and then otium meant \\"leisure\\" while negotium meant \\"non-leisure\\" (work duties still needed to be done). This new time of otium was filled by Greek scholarly pursuits and Greek pleasures. The time environment within which a person existed had sides to it that were filled with Greek customs such as pastimes, hobbies, interchanges of thoughts and ideas, and private bathing. Otium and negotium was then a new social concept which has perpetuated to our own time.Zanker, p. 11 Historian J.M. Andre concludes that the original sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness that happened in the winter,Andre, pp. 20‚Äì22, 35‚Äì36, 79‚Äì81, 421, 434‚Äì37 as opposed to the business (negotium) of the rest of the year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium.Andre, p. 21 Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest.Andre, p. 514 beaute de l'otium individuel poesie du repos. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).T. Maccius Plautus, Mercator (3.2) Cicero busy at work Cicero speaks of himself, with the expression otium cum dignitate, that time spent in activities one prefers is suitable for a Roman citizen who has retired from public life.Auctoritas, Dignitas, Otium When he was ousted from each office, this forced an inactive period, which he used for \\"worthy leisure\\". During this time he composed Tusculanae Disputationes, a series of books on Stoic philosophy. Cicero saw free time as a time to devote to writing.Stroup, p. 61 Cicero defines otium as leisure, avoiding active participation in politics. He further defines it as a state of security and peace (pax) ‚Äì a type of \\"public health\\". It is often associated with tranquility. Cicero advises in his third book On Duties that when the city life becomes too much, one should retreat to the country for leisure.Prosperetti, p. 47 The term otium cum dignitate in Cicero's Pro Sestio was to mean peace (pax) for all and distinction for some.Wirszubski, pp. 93‚Äì94 Cicero says in Pro Sestio, XLV., 98 Cicero explains that, while not necessarily his cup of tea, he recognized many different ways to spend leisure time and otium. In one passage of De Oratore he explains that Philistus spent his retirement writing history as his otium.Cicero, De Oratore, Book ii. 13.57 He goes on to say in De Oratore Book iii that other men passed their otium of leisure due to bad weather that prevented them from doing their daily chores to playing ball, knucklebones, dice games or just games they made up. Others that were \\"retired\\" from public life for whatever reason devoted their otium cum seritio (leisure with service) to poetry, mathematics, music and teaching children.Cicero, De Oratore, Book iii.15.57 German historian Klaus Bringmann shows in Cicero's works that one can not characterize him as a hypocrite while in otium because of his sense of duty to serve the state.Colish, pp. 77‚Äì78 Cicero on \\"otium\\"... Bringmann presents a view of Cicero in which his unwavering sense of duty ... can all be accommodated without the need to depict him as a mediocrity, a hypocrite or a schizophrenic. (Klaus Bringmann ‚Äì Untersuchungen zum spaten Cicero (pp. 229‚Äì32) ‚Äì G√∂ttingen 1971) Cicero's concept of otium does not mean selfish pursuit of pleasure. It means the well- earned leisure which is a culmination of a long career of action and achievement. It's a reward. Idleness (desidia) had derogatory implications and unqualified otium was a problem for Cicero's elite group of followers. Its break away from civic affairs contrasted with negotia publica, participation in civic affairs of the republican aristocracy.Cicero, off. 3.1; Brut. 7‚Äì9 To distinguish between plain \\"idleness\\" and aristocratic otium homestum, otium liberale or otium cum dignitate, writers of the day said that literary and philosophical pursuits were worthwhile activities and that they had benefit to res publica (the general public). These pursuits were a type of 'employment' and therefore not mere laziness.Cicero, Tusc. 1.5; 5.105; fam 1.9.21Sallust, Cat. 3‚Äì4 Cicero praises Cato the Elder for his respectful use of otium in his expression non-minus otii quam negotii (\\"no less for doing nothing than business\\"). Cicero was associating otium with writing and thinking when he admires Cato for pointing out that Scipio Africanus claimed he was \\"never less idle than when he was at leisure, and never less lonely than when he was alone.\\"Beck, p. 42 Cicero in his De Officiis (book III, 1‚Äì4) further says of Scipio Africanus \\"Leisure and solitude, which serve to make others idle, in Scipio's case acted as a goad.\\" Cicero's idea of otium cum dignitate (\\"leisure with dignity\\") is considerably different from today's version of the concept. In his time, this kind of \\"free time\\" was only for the few privileged elite and was mostly made possible by the toil of slaves. It was associated with an egotistic and arrogant lifestyle, compared to those who had to earn their own living with no slaves. Today technology and educational systems enter into the equation on making leisure time (otium) available to almost everyone, not just the privileged elite, which enables the pursuit of hobbies.Bereday, pp. 60 & 156 Cicero has a number of different concept versions for otium. In one concept he feels that a lifetime of loyalty attending one's duty (maximos labores) should be rewarded with some form of retirement. This then promotes great sacrifices which promotes civic peace with honor within the state. He points out that the tranquillity one enjoys is due to the efforts of the majority. This concept of retirement through a lifetime of work was enjoyed only by the ruling class and the elite. The common people could only hope to enjoy a leisurely retirement with dignity as an inheritance.Vasaly, p. 235 Catullus, a late Roman Republic poet, in his poems shows that the significance of otium of the middle Republican time of autonomy into the concept of how, why, and when a member of the patronal class might exchange political activity for literary leisure. He tended to mark otium with erotic influence. = Imperial Rome = A modern reconstruction of a Roman villa The imperial dictatorship by Augustus during the fall of the Roman Republic put the Roman ruling classes into a state of change as their traditional role as always being in town was no longer needed. They were given much leisure time (otium) because of their wealth. The wives of wealthy men were known to write poetry in special rooms devoted to education of the entire family (except the master of the house as it would have been below his dignity).Zanker, pp. 123, 125 The home of choice (domus) then became the countryside villa as the rise of the Roman Empire made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could dream up in the way of a residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners.Webster, p. 19 Greek-style architecture became their new villa otium outside of town. In ancient Roman times the \\"otium villa \\" was a Dionysian idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (otium) in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (negotium).Frazer, p. 86 The \\"villa with a garden\\" and \\"villa by the sea\\" was associated with otium.Zanker, p. 12 The life at the Roman villa was associated with Greek culture in rooms which had Greek themes indicating a \\"superior world\\" of living.Zanker, p. 33 The Imperial Roman poet Statius writes of a \\"otium villa\\" that he planned to retire to in Naples in his work Silvae: It has secure peace, an idle life of leisure, non-troubled rest and sleep. There is no madness in the market-place, no strict laws in dispute...Statius, Silvae 3.5.85‚Äì87 Pliny the Younger exemplified the philosophy of the Roman elite in otium of the time by the life he lived from his \\"otium villas\\". He would dictate letters to his secretary, read Greek and Latin speeches, go on walks on the villa's grounds, dine and socialize with friends, meditate, exercise, bathe, take naps and occasionally hunt. Tibullus was an Augustan elegiac poet who offered an alternative lifestyle to the Roman ideal of the military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his existing first two books of poetry he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus as a commander and soldier to that of a farmer.Cairns, p. 146 Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, adsiduus labor, and military service (militia). He shows in his poetry that originally otium was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons. Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (interdum) and therefore inserts otium (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life.Myers, p. 73 He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism ‚Äì religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of ignobile otium (mean leisure) ‚Äì peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldly ambitions.Lee-Stecum, p. 265 Seneca compares the difference in the Epicurean and Stoic choice of otium. He confesses that classic Stoicism urges active public life while Epicurus has a tendency not to advance public life unless forced to. Seneca views Stoicism and Epicureanism as legitimate to inaction in the proper situations. He defends the Stoic philosophy as leaning toward otium. The main responsibility for the Stoic is to benefit the public in some manner. This could be done by the cultivation of virtue or the research of nature in retirement. This would mean a life of meditation and contemplation rather than an active political life. Seneca shows that otium is not really \\"free time\\", but a study of other matters (i.e., reading, writing) other than political and career gains.Trapp, pp. 220‚Äì21Cancik, p. 69 The increase of retirees retreating to rural villas became more attractive as writers of the day wrote that Stoic ways included pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. This meant that the work of public duties was replaced by otium liberale (liberal leisure) and was sanctified if the retiree did pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy.Seneca, De otio, De brevitate vitae, De tranquillitate animi, ep. 82.3Pliny, epp. 1.22; 9.3 The benefits of the simplicity of rustic country life was reinforced in the intellectual legitimacy of otium ruris (rural leisure) because it drew out the spiritual implications of Horatian and Vergilian images of this type of life.Horace, epod. 2Vergil, g. 2.475‚Äì540Tacitus, dial. 13 Seneca's doctrine of De Otio describes retirement from public life.Erskine, p. 68 The contemplative life that Seneca revised was a Roman debate on otium (a productive peaceful time) and at some point in the evolution of the term was later contrasted to negotium. These are some of the elements in Seneca's doctrine of De Otio: # virtue, freedom and happiness by reasoning. # the military metaphor. # that the virtuous person chooses statio, a specific place for doing one's 'employment'. # otium (leisure) is still negotium (business) even if withdrawal from public activity. # that the virtuous person's otium, as a citizen of the universe, is the field for the performance of his duty.Motto, pp. 160‚Äì61 = Later writers = Augustine studying While Seneca's doctrine appears to be close to the doctrine of Athenodorus's De Tranquillitate it is basically different. In De Otio 3.5 Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in De Tranquillitate the theme is peace of mind.Motto, p. 161 Saint Augustine of Hippo reminded Romans of otium philosophandi, a positive element, that life was happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that otium was the prerequisite for contemplation.Cavadini, p. 618 It was because of otium that Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described Christianae vita otium as the Christian life of leisure.Ferguson, p. 208 Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of otium as the deadly sin of acedia (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated otium as meaning to serve God through deep thought. Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify otium.Hilary, Trin. 1.1‚Äì2 These same Christian writers also showed otium ruris (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic propositum.Paulinus of Nola, ep. 5.4; carm. 10.166 Augustine describes the monastic life as otium sanctum (sanctified leisure or approved leisure). In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions ‚Äì one to be a worthy Christian (vacation ‚Äì negotium) and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion ‚Äì otium).Prosperetti, p. 48 Petrarca Petrarch, 14th-century poet and Renaissance humanist, discusses otium in his De vita solitaria as it relates to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint. Like his favorite Roman authors Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and Livy, he sees otium not as leisure time devoted to idleness, passion, entertainment or mischievous wrongdoing; but time ideally spent on nature appreciation, serious research, meditation, contemplation, writing and friendship. Petrarch considered solitude (i.e., rural setting, \\"villa otium\\", his Vaucluse home) and its relationship to otium as a great possession for a chance at intellectual activity, the same philosophy as Cicero and Seneca.Beck, pp. 43‚Äì44 He would share such a precious commodity with his best friends in the spirit of Seneca when he said \\"no good thing is pleasant to possess without friends to share it.\\"Kleist, p. 136 Historian Julia Bondanella translates Petrarch's Latin words of his own personal definition of otium: Petrarch stressed the idea of an active mind even in otium (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's Vetus Itala in De otio religioso where in Christianity it was associated with contemplation and vacatio (vacate ‚Äì be still). He points out that this is associated with videre (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of otium as vacate et videte (be still and see ‚Äì a form of meditation, contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.Maggi, p. 202 Andrew Marvell's seventeenth-century poem The Garden is a lyric of nine stanzas in which he rejects all forms of activity in the world in favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirementan ancient Roman concept related to otium. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows otium to mean peace, quiet and leisure ‚Äì a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized otium with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.; page 5 Part of Marvell's poem \\"The Garden\\" below: Brian Vickers, a 20th-century British literary scholar, points out an expression made by Friedrich Nietzsche, a 19th-century German philosopher, on scholars' opinion of otium in his 1878 publication Menschliches, Allzumenschliches: , in Friedrich Nietzsche, S√§mtliche Werke, ed. G. Colli and M. Montinari (15 vols., Berlin, 1967) ) II (1967). 132.HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN, 'A Book For Free Spirits' Part I (1914), by Friedrich Nietzsche, translated by Helen Zimmern, FIFTH DIVISION: The Signs of Higher and Lower Culture, IN FAVOUR OF THE IDLE: As a sign that the value of a contemplative life has decreased, scholars now vie with active people in a sort of hurried enjoyment, so that they appear to value this mode of enjoying more than that which really pertains to them, and which, as a matter of fact, is a far greater enjoyment. Scholars are ashamed of otium. But there is one noble thing about idleness and idlers. If idleness is really the beginning of all vice, it finds itself, therefore, at least in near neighbourhood of all the virtues; the idle man is still a better man than the active. You do not suppose that in speaking of idleness and idlers I am alluding to you, you sluggards? }}  Private life and public life meanings  Private life meaning of otium meant personal retirement ‚Äì the opposite of business. It meant leisure only for one's own pleasure with no benefit to the state or public. Examples here is where one attends only his own farm or estate. Another is hunting. It was the opposite of \\"active public life\\". One would not be a historian in this case. In public life otium meant public peace and relief after war. It meant freedom from the enemy with no hostilities. It was not only freedom from external assault (the enemy), it was also freedom from internal disorder (civil war). This then had the meaning of leisure, peace and safety at the homeland. This eventually became the status quo: acceptance of existing political and social conditions of the local laws, the custom of the ancestors, the powers of magistrates, authority of the senate, religions, the military, the treasury, and the praise of the empire.Cicero Pro Sestio 98; cf. 137 Other uses Villa Otium Norway US embassy residence * The term cum dignitate otium (\\"leisure with dignity\\") is found in Cicero's writings and refers to an aim and purpose of the Optimates.Nietzsche, p. 46 * \\"Leisure without literature is death and burial for a living man.\\" ‚Äì a quote from Seneca the Younger. * \\"Leisure is a system of symbols which acts to establish a feeling of freedom and pleasure by formulating a sense of choice and desire.\\"Toner, p. 17 * \\"Mr. Morgan was enjoying his otium in a dignified manner, surveying the evening fog, and smoking a cigar ...\\"Thackeray, p. 349 * The Art nouveau or Jugendstyle residence of the United States Ambassador to Norway is called the Villa Otium.By Norwegian architect Henrik Bull.

Active with trade unions for all his life, he was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1892 by the Liberal Government to achieve a Government majority, and he served until 1914. Early life Jenkinson is a son of John Hartley Jenkinson, who emigrated to Dunedin in the early 1840s. Jenkinson senior was the first jettykeeper at the harbour of that city. Subsequently, he moved to Balclutha, where, at various times, he was chairman of the road board, school committee, and county council. His mother was Jane Jenkinson (n√©e Mathews). Jenkinson junior was born in Dunedin in 1858 and appears on the Presbyterian baptism roll of that year. He was educated at various schools in the Otago region, and completed his studies under J. B. Park, of the South School, Dunedin. On leaving school in 1875, he was employed by Sparrow and Co., at the Dunedin Foundry, and served an apprenticeship of five years to boilermaking and iron shipbuilding. Jenkinson occupied rooms on the third floor of a building in The Octagon, Dunedin where a fire on 8 September 1879 killed thirteen people, and after narrowly escaping through the staircase, he returned upstairs with his roommate, where they found a woman and brought her out. Union activity Three months after joining the Dunedin Boilermakers' Union he was elected president of that body, and visited Australia to represent New Zealand at a conference with New South Wales, Victorian, and South Australian representatives, concerning the formation of an Australasian Federation of Boilermakers' Unions. After returning to New Zealand in 1884, Jenkinson turned his attention to farming, and later on to gold digging. Subsequently, he went to Wellington, where he engaged in his trade, and assisted to form the first Wellington Boilermakers' Union. On returning to his old employers in Dunedin he was re-elected president of the Dunedin Boilermakers' Union, and assisted in forming the Trades Council. In 1886, he accepted employment in the Addington Railway Workshops, but left in the following year as a protest against the system of piecework, which was shortly afterwards abolished. Jenkinson returned to the Addington Workshops in 1888, and took an active part in the formation of the Christchurch Boilermakers' Union, of which he was secretary for several years, and afterwards president and also treasurer. He advocated and inaugurated scientific lectures under the auspices of the Union, and was successful in having the study of boilermaking promoted in the Canterbury School of Engineering. Jenkinson assisted in forming the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, and was a delegate from the Canterbury branch, at the first conference. He was one of the founders of the Canterbury Trades Council, and was successively its vice-president, president, and treasurer. Jenkinson helped to form the first Labour Day Demonstration Committee, of which he was treasurer for many years and a trustee. He was the first president of the Kingsley Club, which was formed for social unity, and he is president and honorary life member of the Tailoresses' Union. Legislative Council Jenkinson was appointed to the Legislative Council on 15 October 1892. He was one of several appointees by the Liberal Government to achieve a Government majority. He resigned on 27 May 1893, but was reappointed only two weeks later on 6 June. Appointments were for seven-year periods, and he was reappointed on 6 June 1900 and 1 July 1907. He retired from the Legislative Council on 30 June 1914. Jenkinson unsuccessfully contested the Clutha electorate for the Liberal Party in the 1914 general election against the incumbent, Alexander Malcolm. Private life He was married on 3 July 1890 at Church of St Michael and All Angels, Christchurch to Annie, daughter of James Eaton of Christchurch and his wife Harriett Eaton (n√©e Miles). John Hay, who successfully lobbied for the establishment of Fiordland National Park, was a brother in law. Annie Jenkinson died aged 50 years, and was buried at Karori Cemetery on 3 November 1915. He remarried on 30 September 1919, to Nellie McCredie, the daughter of Colonel Matthew McCredie. He was a Justice of the Peace and also an Official Visitor to the Sunnyside Asylum. In 1901, Jenkinson lived in Wellington, where he owned the New Zealand Cycle Works. He later lived in Feilding, but returned to Wellington for the last three years of his life. He died in Wellington on 29 November 1937, aged 79. He was buried at Karori Cemetery next to his first wife on 30 November. He was survived by his second wife and his son Edgar, whilst his son Horace (1893‚Äì1917) was killed in action in France in World War I.

It is the type species of the genus Serpula and was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1767 12th edition of Systema Naturae. It lives in a tube into which it can retract. Description Serpula vermicularis lives in a calcareous tube which is attached to a rock, boulder or other hard surface. The tube is often curved, but is not tightly coiled as in some other related species. It can grow to a length of , but is usually shorter than this. The anterior part of the worm protrudes from the tube and has a plume of about 40 feather-like radioles projecting from the second segment, or peristomium, which also houses the two eyes and the mouth. The radioles are bipinnate and covered with fine cilia. They are commonly red, orange or pink and are usually banded with white. A funnel-shaped lid or operculum covers the entrance to the tube when the animal retracts inside. This lid has up to 160 fine creases around its edge and is symmetrical and usually red. It is sometimes divided into two. The yellow-coloured body has seven thoracic segments and up to 190 abdominal segments which are protected by the tube. At least four segments with setae (bristles) are found in the thoracic region.Serpula vermicularis Linnaeus, 1767 Walla Walla University. Retrieved 2011-10-30. Distribution Serpula vermicularis is cosmopolitan in distribution. It is found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the European seaboard of the Atlantic Ocean, but not on the North American coast. It occurs in the intertidal zone and at depths down to . Also along Southern African coast from Olifant's River to Maputo.Branch, G.M., Branch, M.L, Griffiths, C.L. and Beckley, L.E. (2010). Two Oceans: a guide to the marine life of southern Africa Struik Nature, Cape Town. Habitat Serpula vermicularis grows on hard substrates. It favours shells of bivalves, boulders and man-made structures. Around the United Kingdom, juveniles were found to be plentiful growing on the bryozoan, Flustra foliacea. Large colonies sometimes form, but these are seldom on rocks. Larvae may settle on the tubes of other worms and their subsequent development can form reefs. These reefs are very fragile and often break up. This is sometimes due to the activity of certain boring sponges, such as Cliona celata (red boring sponge).Biogenic Reefs UK Marine SAC's Project. Retrieved 2011-11-01. Biology The tube of S. vermicularis is made from calcite and aragonite. Calcium for its manufacture is stored in two white sacs on the ventral side of the peristomium. The tube is fabricated by the glandular ventral shields on the other thoracic segments, where calcium is mixed with an organic secretion to make a paste. This is formed into shape by a collar found just behind the first segment, the prostomium. Serpula vermicularis is a filter feeder and extends its radioles to catch phytoplankton and detritus. The radioles also act as gills. Blood is pumped in and out of these with the flow direction alternating in a single set of vessels. The blood is then pumped through a ventral blood vessel to the tip of the abdomen before returning through a sinus adjoining the gut. The blood of S. vermicularis contains the oxygen-binding pigment chlorocruorin. As well as transporting oxygen to the tissues, this binds carbon monoxide much more efficiently than does human haemoglobin. This may be the reason why the worm may settle and grow on brown seaweeds such as Fucus, but avoids giant kelp, Nereocystis. The latter uses carbon monoxide to inflate its pneumocysts, and this would be toxic to the worm. Life cycle In the United Kingdom, spawning takes place between June and September. The larvae form part of the plankton for up to two months before settling on the seabed. Growth is fairly rapid with tubes extending by 1 cm (0.4 in) in a month. The worms mature in about 10 months and may live for several years. Ecology Coldwater reefs built up by S. vermicularis take many years to develop and provide a hard substrate which other organisms use. The reefs around the United Kingdom support a diverse community of sessile invertebrates, including sponges, hydroids, ascidians, bryozoans, the worm Pomatoceros triqueter, the sea anemone Metridium senile and bivalves such as Chlamys spp., Modiolus modiolus and queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis. Macrofauna include crabs such as Cancer pagurus, the sea urchins Echinus esculentus and Psammechinus miliaris, the brittle star Ophiothrix fragilis, the starfish Asterias rubens and the whelk Buccinum undatum. Red algae grow on the reef in shallow water. The tunicate Pyura microcosmus occurs on these reefs, but is seldom seen in other habitats. A large number of cryptic species of microfauna shelter among the tubes. Predators of the worm include sea urchins, starfish, and the wrasses Crenilabrus melops and Ctenolabrus rupestris.

After leaving the group in 2009, he launched PokerXtrem.fr, an ISPT company in partnership with Laurent Tapie. In 2014, he approached the CEO of GiFi about launching Marketluck, which would be France's first free online poker website. In August 2016, he launched the Bravoloto application that became a big success across Europe with more than 6 million players.  Early life  He was born on March 19, 1981 in Montpellier, France. He is the son of Marl√®ne Partouche, a member of the Partouche family and owner of Brasserie du Th√©√¢tre in Montpellier, France; and Jean-Marc Masquelier, director of the Palavas-les-Flots and Grande-Motte casinos, owned by the Partouche group. After graduating from high school in Montpellier he enrolled at the Cours Florent acting school in 2001. After training for a year at Cours Florent he continued his studies in London.  Career  Masquelier returned to workein the family-owned brasserie in Montpellier before participating in a French reality TV series called Nice People, produced by So Nice Productions and Endemol and broadcast on TF1. This series ran from April 26, 2003 until July 5, 2003. The show concept is based on the story from the film, L‚ÄôAuberge espagnol (known as Pot Luck in Britain and Euro Pudding in the US). In the show, Masquelier shares a house with eleven other young people from different European countries in a villa on the French Riviera. The show attracted nearly 5 million weekly viewers. The final episode aired on prime time on Saturday April 26, 2003 and attracted nearly 7 million viewers. After Nice People, Masquelier began work as a television producer and created Sogimage Productions company. The concept of the company was to organize concerts with ex-reality TV stars to be performed in French overseas territories. These events were sponsored by Orange, the French telecommunications company. Presented by Elodie Gossuin from 2003 to 2004, these concerts drew an average audience of 5,000‚Äì7,000 people. On January 22, 2005 Masquelier introduced the first French TV show dedicated to poker. Produced in partnership with PartyGaming this was the first of its kind on French television. Twenty-two episodes were made. The show received sponsorship from PartyGaming, an English company operating in the gambling sector. In 2006, Masquelier joined the Partouche group and became the director of the newly created Partouche Interactive. In parallel, Masquelier launched the Charity Poker Festival, a poker tournament that brought together cinema celebrities including from Hollywood. Tournament participants included, Salma Hayek, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Tim Robbins, Woody Harrelson and Dennis Hopper. Created in 2008, the Charity Poker Festival awarded one million dollars to a celebrity's charity of choice. The tournament was held at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, and was won by Woody Harrelson and Alice Taglioni. Their prize money went to the Enfants et Sant√© child cancer foundation and Oasis Preserve International. In 2009, Masquelier left the family company to start Full Fun, an online poker company in partnership with Georges Djen, the director of Live Poker. With new French legislation authorizing online gambling, Full Fun applied for a license to operate its online poker website. On July 26, 2010 the Full Fun company received approval from ARJEL and launched the PokerXtrem.fr website. The site went live on October 1. At the end of 2010, Masquelier teamed up with Bernard and Laurent Tapie to create the ISPT (International Stadium Poker Tour) production company. ISPT is the largest poker tournament in the world organized exclusively in football stadiums. The ISPT draws poker players from across the world and holds the Guinness World Record for the largest poker tournament, held at Wembley Stadium on June 5, 2013. At the end of 2011, Masquelier approached the Socodem group about merging PokerXtrem.fr and Mypok.fr. The two websites were merged on August 1, 2011 with approval from ARJEL (French online gaming regulatory authority). At the end of 2013, Masquelier approached the JOA group, the third largest casino operator in France about operating the Mypoke.fr website in partnership. In 2015, he met Philippe Ginestet, the founder and owner of the Gifi retail chain. Together on August 15, 2016 they launched the Bravoloto app. Three months later, nearly one million people had downloaded the app, which led to nearly 200,000 daily users. To boost its development and visibility, Masquelier partnered with French comedian, R√©mi Gaillard. The result of this partnership with Bravoloto, \\"I Give You Money\\", was posted on Gaillard's YouTube channel. The video created buzz with over 15 million views. The partnership between Bravoloto and R√©mi Gaillard included a charity operation to raise money for the SPA (the French SPCA). People could help raise money for the animal protection society by playing the Bravoloto app. For each grid played, Bravoloto promised to donate 1 centime (euro) to the SPA. In total nearly 200,000 euros were raised through this operation. Masquelier continued to support animal welfare through Bravoloto by contributing funds to Gaillard's \\"ANYMAL\\" foundation. He is a co-founder of ANYMAL. In August 2018, he entered into history by sending the first mojito into space. The video delivered more than 1 million views.

In philosophy he was mostly interested in epistemology. He held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Malta between 1953 and 1971. Life Sapiano was born at Balzan, Malta, in 1911. He began his studies at the Lyceum, where he showed special interest in literature, and was also awarded prices for it. Afterwards, he pursued his studies at the Gregorian University in Rome (1928‚Äì39). He was ordained a priest in 1934. At Rome he obtained a doctorate in philosophy, another in theology, and a licentiate in Church history. Back in Malta in 1944, Sapiano was appointed Professor of Patrology and Liturgy at the University of Malta. In 1950, for the next year and a half, he held the Chair of Philosophy at the same university on a pro tem basis. After becoming, in 1951, a Professor of Philosophy he continued some studies for another year and a half, and then, in 1953, he was finally appointed to the Chair of Philosophy, an office he kept for the next twenty years, up till 1971. Here, of course, he had a full complement of courses. Simultaneously, between 1944 and 1952, he also taught dogmatics, patrology, and liturgy at the bishop‚Äôs major seminary, and Latin at the minor seminary. Furthermore, he was theologian of the Metropolitan Chapter (1952), and prosynodal examiner and judge at the bishop‚Äôs curia. He died in 1985. Works Sapiano was an Aristotelico-Thomist Scholastic. All his writings bear witness to such a philosophical character. Though his academic and intellectual career spans over many decades, his philosophical publications are sporadic. He published some articles in Maltese periodicals such as Melita Theologica, Seminarium Melitense, and Scientia, but they are not of much significance. More interesting than these are his unpublished manuscripts containing his class notes. Although none of them are dated, they presumably go back to around 1951.

Posted online on Reddit under his handle Prufrock451 on August 21, 2011, it describes what might happen if a United States Marine Corps expeditionary unit were somehow transported back to the time of the Roman Empire under Augustus Caesar. The first few installments were published on Reddit, corresponding to the first eight days of the Marines' arrival. The full story is not publicly available because the rights were bought by Warner Bros., which announced the production of its movie adaptation. Several years later, the hosts of the National Public Radio program Endless Thread call the short story \\"one of the most famous creative anachronism ever made by the Internet... an anachronism that was going to be huge, like a Ridley Scott movie huge,... plucked from obscurity, optioned by Hollywood, and then never to be heard from again.\\" Background The story was inspired by a hypothetical question Erwin had read on the social news website Reddit about whether or not a modern U.S. Marine battalion could completely wipe out the entire Roman Empire. Erwin, an author from Cedar Rapids, Iowa and two-time Jeopardy! champion, responded to the question by offering online a short fiction account about how a unit of Marines accidentally traveled back in time and ended up battling with Roman legions during the reign of Augustus. Respondents to his post dubbed his story \\"Rome, Sweet Rome\\" and \\"demanded\\" more details. Erwin responded to their wishes and expanded on his original story, and with input from other Reddit users, eventually completed a short story. A growing fan base mocked up book covers, movie posters, and posted related music videos to YouTube. Others have created dramatic readings. Plot The story is a fictional account of what might happen if a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) of 2,200 men were to be somehow transported through time from their base in modern-day Kabul, Afghanistan to the time of the Roman Empire when being ruled by Augustus Caesar, appearing near the Tiber River in 23 BCE with their full allotment of equipment - M1 Abrams battle tanks, bulletproof vests, M249 SAW light machine guns, M16A4 rifles, and grenades, but with no way to resupply with fuel or ammunition when depleted. =Plot analysis= Popular Mechanics spoke with Erwin about his story concept of a modern Marine unit confronting Roman legions in battle, and then discussed the concept with Adrian Goldsworthy, an expert on Roman history. In comparing a Marine Mechanized Infantry Unit, typically containing about 2,200 troops, along with associated artillery and vehicles, to that of the Roman legions, which at that time consisted of nearly 330,000 men armored in either heavy leather or in metal, carrying swords and javelins as weapons, and operating ballistae and crossbows as their long distance weapons, Goldsworthy noted that Roman armor would be useless against rifle rounds and grenades: :\\"Obviously, there is a massive difference in firepower.\\" He expanded that, while Marines would begin with a huge advantage, their inability to be resupplied as they depleted their ammunition and fuel would result, after a few days of devastating the Romans, in a complete reversal of fortune. The original advantage of superior technology would vanish and the Marines would then have to deal with a massively superior opposing force after themselves being reduced to that force's level of weapon technology. Goldsworthy concluded in his analysis, that without resupply and in lacking access to modern navigation aids such as GPS, the Marines would lose over the long term. He granted, however, that modern knowledge of strategy and tactics could allow a knowledgeable, mobile, and quickly-moving Marine force to \\"destabilize the Roman Empire, encourage civil war, and initiate regional fracturing.\\" Since they nonetheless would lack the necessary manpower, the Marines could not expect to \\"control Rome itself‚Äîwith a population of a million or so‚Äîlet alone the wider empire.\\" Film adaptation Among those who read the story online was Adam Kolbrenner of Beverly Hills- based production company Madhouse Entertainment. Liking the story concept, he made a deal to represent Erwin and then optioned the movie rights to Warner Bros. Erwin was hired to write the first version of the screenplay. Gianni Nunnari, founder and owner of Hollywood Gang Productions and producer of the action adventure motion pictures 300 and Immortals, had been announced as co- producer of the project. The film was to be produced by Kolbrenner and Nunnari, with Robyn Meisinger as executive producer. John Ridley, also of Hollywood Gang, was slated to oversee the project for the company. In 2013, Warner Brothers hired screenwriter Brian Miller to rewrite the script. Miller was the writer for the film Apollo 18, his most significant writing and production credit at that time. Other than the general concept, Miller did not use Erwin's work as the basis for his script. In Miller's version of the story, U.S. Special Forces would replace the Marine unit as the modern time- traveling fighting force. By 2018, the screenplay had been languishing in development hell for five years since the most recent script rewrite of 2013 and has yet to be picked up for further development. =Licensing issues= Techdirt reported that due to Reddit's licensing terms, Erwin may not have had full ownership of the story he wrote, and may not have been able to fully transfer those rights to Warner Bros. Concerns were raised due to Erwin's creation of the story in the Reddit forums occurring with and through participation and input from other Reddit users. The issues then became those of whether or not Erwin had the right to grant exclusivity to Warner, and that Reddit may own rights to those portions of the story created and shared on their website. While the concept of modern military forces involving themselves in conflicts with less advanced cultures is a common theme in science fiction (e.g., G.I. Samurai), in order to claim exclusivity, Erwin may have been required to rewrite the story to remove those portions created through input of Reddit users. On October 21, 2011, Reddit administrators explained that the licensing terms were designed to protect the site from potential legal action, and that they did not intend to block the production of the movie.

Simon Tharakan, an NRI who came to know about a news article of mechanical robot founded by Sreekuttan's friend V.S Sabu travelled to India to meet the inventor and he decided to produce a film. Sabu and Tharakan decided to have Sreekuttan to handle the direction after observing his work on the sets of Sargam. Sreekuttan expressed his interest to do a live-action animated film to which they agreed. Tharakan came up with a concept based on character Fagin from Oliver Twist. Tharakan's son Roquey was chosen to portray the film's main protagonist. = Filming = To make actors react and emote to the animated character, Sreekuttan chosen Raghu of Mela to play human version of Faby and a costume was created to resemble the sketches of Faby and given to Raghu. After this, the scenes were shot again leaving spaces to be ‚Äúfilled in later‚Äù with the animated figures. For the post-production to include animation, makers met Ram Mohan, father of animation who scolded them for making a film without employing an animator for pre-production and for not story boarding the film however he then gave them drawings for the cartoon characters along with a template of expressions for each situation. Makers had problems in including the animated sequences to the footage so a basic Click 3 camera was bought and a halogen light was fixed onto it, \\"Each film from O‚Äô Faby's reels was then fixed onto the Click 3 camera for the image to get magnified, making the tracing simpler\\". Around 50 artists too were hired full-time to sketch the cartoon characters into cel sheets which went on for more than a year. The film's budget was around 1.4. crores.  Soundtrack  Soundtrack was composed by Johnson. *O Faby - K. J. Yesudas *Rajapakshi - K. J. Yesudas *Dingara Dinga - S. P. Balasubramaniam *Thaaazhathum - K. S.

It claims, in a nutshell, that the result of syntactic transformation must be structurally identical to a structure that can be generated without transformations. For example, the by then popular passive transformation derives :Prince Jamal was strangled by Fabio. from the active :Fabio strangled Prince Jamal. But the syntactic structure of the passive sentence, Subj Aux V-Particple Prep NP is by and large the same as that found in an active sentence like :Prince Jamal has dined at Fabio's. This did not follow from general properties of syntactic transformations at the time. In principle, these could have generated e.g. passive sentences that look nothing like any active sentence (e.g. was by Fabio strangled Prince Jamal). The Structure Preservation Principle thus restricted the generative power of transformations by restricting the output of transformations to those kinds of structures that could also occur in simple, non-transformed sentences.

They are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The building was erected in about 1670, possibly above earlier undercrofts. The name reflects the trade undertaken with the Low Countries around that time. At the time it was built, it was the tallest and most impressive building in Bridge Street, and remained so for over 200 years. By the 1970s the building was in a state of decay, and it was restored and rebuilt in 1973‚Äì75 by Chester City Council. The rebuilding involved removing the whole of the fa√ßade and rebuilding it, and replacing the internal timberwork with steel. In the process many of the internal features were lost. Architecture The Dutch Houses are constructed on sandstone piers, probably originating from the medieval period, with timber framing from the late 17th century, and rendered brickwork from the late 17th or the 18th century. It consists of three bays in four storeys plus an attic. The bottom storey incorporates the undercrofts, and a portion of the Chester Rows passes through the first floor. The lowest storey, at street level, includes modern shop fronts. At the level of the Row are painted wood barley sugar balusters with rails. Behind these are stallboards, the paved walkway of the Row, and more modern shopfronts. The third and fourth storeys are jettied, both containing barley sugar pilasters and casement windows of varying sizes. The attic storey is set back, each bay containing a three-light mullioned and transomed window.

Along with the Galaxy Nexus and Droid RAZR, it was expected to be a major competitor to the iPhone 4S. It was released on November 14, 2011. It is also the first phone to use Beats Audio technology, and comes with a special pair of the Beats by Dr. Dre's iBeats earphones with black earpieces and red wiring. Before its initial release, the phone was rumored to be the replacement for the ThunderBolt, and even nicknamed the \\"Thunderbolt 2\\" in the enthusiast community. The HTC Rezound is the second Verizon Wireless phone available that allows simultaneous surf and talk on the Verizon Wireless 4G LTE network. This capability is due to the duplication of some functions between the Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 MSM8660 SoC (System on Chip) and the Qualcomm MSM9600 modem chip. The Snapdragon SoC provides all CDMA2000 functionality, including voice, while the MSM9600 duplicates CDMA2000 data functionality with the addition of GSM-derived LTE (Long Term Evolution) functionality.This also gave the HTC Rezound the ability to simultaneous surf and talk in 3G environments.This arrangement also calls for radio antenna redundancy. The phone has a 4.3 inch 1280x720 display and was tied with the Sony Xperia S for the highest pixel density in any smartphone released (342 PPI) until the arrival of HTC Butterfly/Droid DNA with a 5-inch 1920x1080 resolution screen (440 PPI).

The organization published a document calling for a \\"National General Assembly\\" to be held beginning the week of July 4, 2012 in Philadelphia, which was rejected by the general assemblies of OWS and Occupy Philadelphia. The Declaration includes demands for an immediate ban on all monetary and gift contributions to all politicians, implementation of a public financing system for political campaigns, and the enactment of an amendment to the United States Constitution overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. FEC decision.Walsh, J. (October 20, 2011) \\"Do we know what OWS wants yet?\\" Salon Background The Occupy Wall Street movement began as an advertised demonstration which posed the question \\"What is our one Demand?\\", inviting protesters to identify and rally around a particular cause. This led several individuals and groups to propose various demands including the 99 Percent Declaration. \\"Occupy\\" protesters from across the country have said that the 99 Percent Declaration group \\"is simply co-opting the 'Occupy' name\\", and Occupy Wall Street has not endorsed the 99% Declaration, which reportedly \\"generated more controversy than consensus\\" at the New York General Assembly and was \\"flat out rejected by the Philadelphia General Assembly.\\" The Occupy Philadelphia General Assembly stated that \\"We do not support the 99% Declaration, its group, its website, its National GA and anything else associated with it.\\"LaIntelligencia \\"99% Declaration Receives a Vote of ‚ÄúNo Support‚Äù from OP GA\\" Occupy Philly Media, 15 December 2011 Occupy Wall Street released a statement indicating that \\"[t]he group's plans blatantly contradict OWS' Statement of Autonomy, as passed by the General Assembly at Occupy Wall Street,\\" and clarifying that any statement issued outside of the New York City General Assembly's website \\"should be considered independent of Occupy Wall Street.\\" A Washington Times editorial criticized the group's proposed restrictions on political contributions and speech, saying they \\"would leave us less free and show a woeful contempt for the First Amendment.\\" Attorney Michael Pollok had issued a press release representing himself as the group's co-founder and publicizing its plans, also expressing understanding that the NY General Assembly \\"fears 'co-opting' by Occupy spin-off groups like ours\\", but indicating his belief that \\"occupations and protests will not end the corporate state\\" and that a petition for redress of grievances is the best way to achieve the \\"dismantling [of] corporate control of our country\\". Michael Pollok has stated on his earliest websites and Facebook pages (since deleted or edited) that he came into contact with OWS through providing legal representation to several of the people who were arrested on September 30, 2011 during a march of 700 protesters across the Brooklyn Bridge. None of those protesters has ever come forward to verify this. Very early on, the group was fraught with contention among participants and went through several incarnations of leadership before the actual event that took place the weekend of July 4, 2012. Little is known about how the actual voting process was conducted, how many voters or delegates there actually were, or whether the group exists any longer. The document and national general assembly A national general assembly, the Continental Congress 2.0, was announced in March 2012. It was organized by the 99% Declaration working group. The Congress was to comprise 878 delegates, from all 435 Congressional districts, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia; however not every district was represented though about 836 contributed to topics to be included and voting on their selection for inclusion in the petition. Only about 76 delegates were finally elected and present at the gathering, which lasted from July 2 to 4. The Congress drafted and ratified a 21st-century petition for the redress of grievances, in accordance with the right to petition guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution. The petition was to be publicly presented to the American people and copies were to be served to the United States Congress, Supreme Court and President Barack Obama.

CARECEN was founded in 1981 to protect the rights of refugees arriving from conflict in Central America and to help ease their transition by providing legal services. CARECEN provides direct services in immigration, housing and citizenship while also promoting empowerment, civil rights advocacy and civic training for Latinos. Another CARECEN is also located in Los Angeles and which was established two years after the D.C. location.  History and mission Established in 1981 and incorporated in 1982, the Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), originally named the Central American Refugee Center, was founded to protect the rights of refugees from Central America's wars and provide direct legal services that would ease their transition to their new home. During the 1980s and 1990s, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala suffered from civil wars, while Honduras suffered more than a decade of civil strife in the form of a dirty war.Ferris, Elizabeth G., The Central American Refugees, Praeger, 1987, 159 pages This period also saw mass migration from Central America to neighboring countries, Mexico and the United States. Prior to 1980, the United States limited its recognition of refugees and asylees to those fleeing from communist governments, while the 1951 United Nations Convention and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees more generally accepted the definition of refugees and asylees as those fleeing their country from political oppression. The Refugee Act of 1980, signed into law by Jimmy Carter, established the definitions of asylum and refugee status in line with those of the United Nations. However, the United States was still in the midst of the Cold War, which strongly influenced public recognition of civil war and political oppression around the world. For example, 98% of Salvadoran requests for asylum were denied, while approximately the same percentage of Nicaraguans who claimed to be fleeing from a far leftist government was granted political asylum.  CARECEN in Los Angeles  CARECEN in Los Angeles is located in the Westlake, Los Angeles neighborhood in where it was founded in 1983. While it was formed independently from CARECEN-DC, it was modeled after the DC organization. The original name of the Los Angeles CARECEN was Central American Refugee Center as it addressed the needs of the arriving refugee immigrants that hoped to get asylum certificationNora Hamilton and Norma Stoltz Chinchilla, Seeking Community in a Global City: Guatemalans and Salvadorans in Los Angeles. (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001), 122 The organization opened under its doors to the Central American community of Westlake under the leadership of Linton Joaquin as the Executive Director. In the 1980s, CARECEN focused primarily on garnering attention to the violence and human rights violation occurring in Central America, with a special focus on El Salvador. In 1984, CARECEN members went on a 15-day hunger strike to renounce the deportation of Salvadoran immigrants by the Reagan administration The following year, CARECEN co-counseled a class action lawsuit, Orantes- Hernandez vs. Meese which disputed the INS practices towards Salvadorans and in the process discouraging them from applying for asylum. It was not until 1988 when CARECEN gained a victory in the lawsuit as the court issued an injunction to protect the due process rights of Salvadoran refugees and have a right to seek legal asylum. In 1991, CARECEN sent two of its staff members, along with four attorneys from Gibson, Dunn, & Crtucher law firm, to investigate the massacre at El Zapote. Under the leadership of Roberto Lovato, a Salvadoran-American, the Central American Refugee Center officially changed its name to Central American Resource Center. This shift marked the different direction that the organization took. While still catering the needs of immigrants in Los Angeles, CARECEN adapted to the new needs of immigrants whom were permanently establishing homes in Los Angeles. Its name change came along with a reshaping and addition of community services and expansion of a focus from Salvadoran immigrants to the greater Latino community. It began to place emphasis on the legal, educational, and social services geared towards the immigrant communities. In 1994, it was among the leading organizations coming together to oppose the California Proposition 187 which barred immigrants from social services. In 1996, it joined other civil rights organizations in against California Proposition 209 which threatened affirmative action in the state. Most recently, in 2006, along with other immigrant advocacy organizations such as Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, CARECEN organized the march against the bill H.R. 4437, also known as the Sensenbrenner Bill, that would have criminalized all undocumented immigrants. CARECEN-LA continues to support the needs of the immigrant community of Los Angeles and remains expanding its services, which now include youth services & tutoring and Day labor Center, to meet the evolving needs of its constituents. In the Legal Department, the center offers U visa and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) services and Temporary protected status (TPS) renewals. It has recently begun processing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals petitions and Unaccompanied minor screening from the 2014 American immigration crisis. CARECEN also established a parent center called Centro de Padres de CARECEN \\"Raul G. Borbon\\", named after an education community activist who fought for equity and quality in the public education system of Los Angeles. In the parent center, it offers English classes to Spanish-speaking immigrants as well as a new addition called Plaza Comunitaria/Casa Universitaria that allows adults to continue their education by elementary and middle school curriculum. It has also established a Youth Center where it offers students from low income and immigrant families apply to college and a leadership program to get youth to know about organizing and civil engagement. CARECEN continues to be involved in the surrounding community through different actions and campaigns. The active campaigns that CARECEN is either spearheading or is involved with are TPS for Residency, Fix L.A., and ICE out of LA among many others.  Central American Wars  The CARECEN Program of 1981, which sought to protect the rights of immigrants fleeing from their respective countries, came into effect after the influx of immigration caused by various civil wars faced by a number of Central American countries, specifically Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. In the 1950s decade, prior to the civil war era which erupted in Guatemala, a governorship of communist ideals had ruled over the country. Country leaders, Jacobo Arbenz and Juan Jose Arevalo were very prominent pieces of the communist party that governed Guatemala. Though these leaders were democratically elected, it had become evident that communist governing strategies had become a focal point of their political agendas. Such political agendas had now caught the attention of the United States, who had recently begun assisting in destroying communist ideals in the Cold War. President Dwight D. Eisenhower advocated that the government must back the Guatemalan rebels in what is known as coup d'√©tat which worked to overthrow the country's communist regime by instilling a right wing, authoritative and conservative governorship in Guatemala. The Guatemalan civil war was divided into several phases of violence and resistance. Through widespread human rights violations in which the people of Guatemala suffered, a three-decade long civil war erupted that spanned from 1960 to 1996. Though a peace treaty was later signed, ending the Guatemalan civil l war in the late 1990s, an influx of immigration to the United States in the prior three and a half decades became imminent as the masses fled to the United States in search of an improved environment of livability and freedom. The 1970s found the country of El Salvador mobilized politically against a reformed government. Laborers who had been employed in the agricultural industry had embarked on a massive strike in efforts to earn more pay for their work as well as improved working conditions. As government officials became increasingly involved, the strikes were met with brutal consequences which led to violence and bloodshed with tens of thousands of Salvadorians perishing in the military led conflict. Much of the atrocities that added to the conflict included death squads which would mercilessly murder large groups of people, as well as requirement of underaged soldiers, both incredible violations of human rights. These civil conflicts and others were the cause of a substantial influx of war related death in the 1980s in El Salvador. Through all the rummage and chaos that had plagued the citizens of El Salvador, The United States became a pivotal part in aiding the Salvadorian government in keeping control against the militias. The United States bridging the presidential periods of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan at times financially aided El Salvador at a makeable rate of around 50 million dollars a month. In the early 1990s a peace treaty was signed ending the conflict, but a big question was raised about the need for human rights organizations. The CARCEN program which was established in 1981 is one among many that today protects the right of the Salvadorian immigrants who are currently living in the United States. The 1960s and 1970s in Nicaragua was the start of a very bloody revolution which was led by the Nicaraguan people against Nicaraguan right wing dictator, Anastasio Somoza. The violent outburst happened in response to the oppressive dictatorship forced upon the people of Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan revolution was responsible for taking the lives of tens of thousands of individuals and had no shortage of violence and bloodshed. The rebels, famously known as the FSLN (Sandinista National Liberation Front) carried out a highly coveted arrangement to overthrow the dictatorship which had been in play for almost half a century. Through a number of very strategic and merciless methods of fighting, such as kidnapping and ransom, Somoza finally opted to resign his power and gave the control of the country to the FSLN. Although the United States did not necessarily back the rebels in their fight to overthrow their government, President Carter did release around 100 million dollars to Nicaragua in aid. This came as many of the citizens of Nicaragua were living in immense poverty at the end of the regime.  Central Americans in the United States  Much of the issues that Central Americans endure in the United States is well documented. Over the last few decades, immigration from Central America is grown exponentially. Programs like CARECEN have aided these migrants in fitting in to Los Angeles in efforts to give them a sense of identity and self-development in the United States. Much attention has been given to the manner in which Central American students have fared in the inner city school systems. While many flourish in their new schools, the dropout rates exceed the national average. According to HPDP, the year 1982 saw a dropout rate of 11.4% of Central American migrants. Many of the students who do graduate, continue to college or pursue a job in the workforce. With the help of CARECEN many of the Central American migrants have a higher chance in securing a job and receiving legal aid if necessary. The program also gives many of its members a platform to do volunteer work as they please to help the community with any issues that may arise. There are currently roughly 600,000 Central Americans living in Los Angeles while there are roughly 3,500,000 million Central Americans countrywide.

Percival's work influenced Robert Bruce Foote. Percival began his career in British held Sri Lanka and Bengal as a Wesleyan Methodist missionary. He was instrumental in starting and upgrading a number of Christian schools within the Jaffna peninsula. After returning to England, he converted to Anglicanism. Subsequent to his posting in South India, he severed his association with the Anglican Missionary Society that had sent him to India and worked as an educator in Presidency College in Madras Presidency. He published English-Tamil and English-Telugu dictionaries as well as a number of books on Indian culture and religion. He died in 1882 in Yercaud in present-day Tamil Nadu. Career =Sri Lanka= Peter Percival, aged 23, was sent to Jaffna peninsula in Sri Lanka in 1826 by the Wesleyan Methodist Mission, with concerns whether his appointment is risky in \\"an atmosphere of immoral heathenism\\". At his arrival the missionary society and its efforts had not produced results expected by their original expectations and goals. A number of previous missionaries had returned to Europe after short stints due to illness. Percival spent most of his early adult life in Jaffna peninsula until 1851, with a short stint in Bengal (1829‚Äì32). Percival's views and style brought him conflict with fellow missionaries such as Joseph Roberts. After Roberts left, Percival led the missionary efforts in Jaffna district. Percival, states Findlay's records of the mission, then had conflicts with Ralph Stott. Percival favored Christian schools rather than the direct evangelization approach of Stott. Between 1834 and 1836, his efforts led to the opening of religious schools ‚Äì including those for girls ‚Äì and the building of St. Paul's chapel in Jaffna. Some of these schools were later upgraded to colleges. As a Protestant missionary, Percival favored the teaching of Christian texts in the local vernacular (Tamil) rather than English or Portuguese. During his tenure as the principal of Jaffna Central College, he hired his former student Arumuka Navalar as a teacher. They worked together between 1841 and 1848, and collaborated with him to translate the Bible into Tamil. Percival's preference of education over evangelism created friction with other Wesleyan missionaries but it also influenced the educational practices of all those who were trying to improve the literary levels of 19th-century Sri Lankan Tamil society. =England= In 1851, he returned to England with the intention of coming back to Sri Lanka but due to differences with the Methodist hierarchy in London, he renounced Methodism. In 1852, he was ordained deacon by the Anglican Bishop of London. During the next two years, he worked as a lecturer at St Augustine's College, Canterbury, teaching a course about India and its religions. =India= In 1854, he went to Madras in South India with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, an Anglican missionary society. He became an Anglican priest ordained by Bishop of Madras in 1855. In 1856 after becoming the Registrar of Madras University and Professor of Sanskrit and Vernacular Literature in Presidency College, he severed his relationship with the missionary society. Later life In India he was known a scholar in Tamil and Telugu. After having published the Tamil translation of the Bible, he wrote the book Land of the Veda: India Briefly Described in some of its Aspects, Physical, Social, Intellectual and Moral. His other publications include, a book on Tamil proverbs in English, English-Tamil and English-Telugu dictionaries, and a bilingual Tamil and Telugu journal Dinavartamani. He also translated into English, Tamil proverbs and the literary work of Avvaiyar, a Tamil poet. His daughter married pioneering geologist and archaeologist Robert Bruce Foote. Peter Percival and Robert Bruce Foote were lifelong friends and shared their interest in Indian culture, history and linguistics. He retired to the hill station town of Yercaud and died in 1882. Graves of both Peter Percival and Robert Bruce Foote were found in the cemetery of the Holy Trinity Church at Yercaud in 2009.

The episode features a rock opera based on songs written by Charlie Kelly. The episode was later adapted into a short- lived stage musical in 2009.  Plot  With a spring in his step, Charlie notifies the gang that he's written a musical. Dennis and Mac quiz Charlie over his motivations, but ultimately want to play the parts that Charlie has written for them. Charlie enlists the help of Artemis to transcribe the script into words and the gang squabble over which parts to play. Initially, Mac is excited to play The Dayman, but Dennis goads him into trading parts. Frank is cast as the troll and Dee is picked to play the princess. Dee is concerned over the subject matter of her song's lyrics, contending they sound like she molests children with a rusty fork. Charlie also tries in vain to get Frank to say \\"boy's soul\\" rather than \\"boy's hole\\" in his song. Charlie tracks down The Waitress, giving her a ticket and telling her that he will never bother her again if she attends. On the night of the show, the gang is excited to perform for an audience. However, some drama ensues when Dee ad-libs a song clarifying that she's not interested in children, much to Charlie's chagrin. Mac gets laughs when he comes on stage as The Nightman, much to his dismay. The Troll sings to The Nightman that he has to pay the Troll Toll to get the boy's soul, although Frank's pronunciation results in him saying \\"hole\\" instead of \\"soul.\\" Mac hops onto Dennis in bed, who points out that Mac has an erection. Dennis transforms into the Dayman and kills the Troll with a handgun. The Dayman fights the Nightman and pulls his heart out. The remaining cast members then join together for an ensemble reprise of \\"Dayman,\\" which Dennis and Charlie came up with in the earlier episode \\"Sweet Dee's Dating a Retarded Person\\" Following \\"The Dayman\\" reprise, Charlie swoops down from a sun from above the stage, wearing a yellow outfit, singing \\"Marry Me\\" to The Waitress as a wedding proposal to her. However, Charlie's gambit is all for naught, as she declines his proposal and storms out. Production The Dayman was first introduced on the show as lyrics envisioned by Charlie Kelly after a night of huffing spray paint from a sock in the ninth episode of the third season, \\"Sweet Dee's Dating a Retarded Person.\\" \\"Scott Marder and Rob Rosell wrote the episode and the lyrics: 'Dayman, fighter of the Nightman, champion of the sun / He's a master of karate and friendship for everyone,'\\" Glenn Howerton explained, \\"Which are just the worst fucking lyrics ever, which is exactly what we wanted.\\" The unexpectedly enthusiastic reception of the Dayman song inspired the cast to devise a musical episode, but one \\"organic to the tone of the series.\\" One of the initial ideas was the musical being an elaborate prank with a rival bar but that concept was eventually abandoned. \\"We finally realized: Maybe Charlie writes the musical and our characters are just so fucking vain that we can't stomach the thought of Charlie getting other people to do it,\\" said Howerton. \\"Any time we deal with that kind of subject matter, I like to think it's coming from a more intelligent place,\\" Charlie Day explained. \\"A rape joke is not remotely a funny thing; a man writing a musical that he thinks is about self-empowerment, and not realizing that all his lyrics sound like they're about a child being molested, is a funny thing. The joke is coming from confusion and misunderstanding, which are classic tropes of all comedy.\\" Most of the music in the episode was written by Day and composer Cormac Bluestone. \\"I said, 'Let me go off and write some of the songs and lyrics,' and I went to the piano,\\" Day said. \\"We'd already had the Dayman song, so I pulled out the 'Troll Toll' and 'Tiny Boy, Little Boy' songs.\\" The episode was performed in front of background actors who didn't have any context for the musical so their bemused reactions were genuine. Director Matt Shakman told the cast, \\"Just do it all the way through.\\" \\"I got Artemis Pebdani to act like the stage manager of the event and actually come out and do the speech that you always hear in shows about where the fire exits are,\\" Shakman said. \\"I remember a lot of confused faces as we were performing,\\" Rob McElhenney recalled. \\"People [who weren't familiar with the show] were wondering why it was funny‚Ä¶ But I always go back to Glenn and Charlie; if they're still laughing, then I know it's funny.\\" Stage adaptation Glenn Howerton in costume as The Dayman. In September 2009, the cast took their show live. The \\"Gang\\" performed the musical The Nightman Cometh in New York City, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. Mary Elizabeth Ellis and Artemis Pebdani also appeared in the performance as The Waitress and Artemis. Actress Rhea Perlman (wife of Danny DeVito) assumed the role of Gladys. McElhenney said that Live Nation originally approached the cast about doing the show at 30 cities, but in the end the cast settled on 6. Howerton described the show as \\"essentially an expanded version of the actual episode of \\"The Nightman Cometh\\", which was the final episode for season four. There are some added moments, added scenes, added songs, and extended versions of songs that already existed.\\" Two new songs were included in the performance and a longer running time allowed for greater improvisation by the actors. The performance was also preceded by a preview screening of a season five episode. The Los Angeles performance, filmed at The Troubadour, was included as a bonus feature on the season four DVD box set.  Trivia  The title of Charlie's play is a reference to Eugene O'Neill's classic play The Iceman Cometh. O'Neill's play is described as being about \\"dead-end alcoholics who spend every possible moment seeking oblivion in one another's company and trying to con or wheedle free drinks from Harry and the bartenders\\", which is a good description of the gang.

It consists of a selection in chronological order of authentic footage, mostly newsreels and documentaries, shown on cinema screens in France between 1940 and 1944. Intertitles or a narrator occasionally add linking or supplementary information. The bulk of the material was produced under the Vichy r√©gime and the aim of the film is to show the worldview which the collaborationist government of P√©tain promoted to its population. Themes The main messages conveyed by this Vichy propaganda were: *That the elderly P√©tain was a father to his people, incarnating the true France and heading its legitimate government. The unnamed de Gaulle was therefore a traitor and his pretensions to lead an alternative government false. *That the destiny of France lay in co-operation with the German occupiers to build a new Europe which excluded Britain and the USA to the west and the USSR to the east. *That collaboration with Nazi Germany included supplying workers of both sexes to its factories and sending soldiers to fight communism on the Eastern Front. *That the German armed forces were France's protectors against the Western Allies, who only brought destruction by bombing and invasion. Coverage of Anglo-American attacks emphasised the civilians killed and dwellings demolished. *That after resounding victories at El Alamein and Stalingrad, the invincible German forces made strategic withdrawals from North Africa and Russia. *That those who actively resisted the security forces of Vichy and the German occupiers were terrorists to be exterminated and that for every German killed innocent hostages would be shot. *That Jews were aliens and enemies, to be rounded up and deported.

Although his thoughts remained philosophically grounded in the Christian tradition, he was primarily interested in Existentialism.Mark Montebello, Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f‚ÄôMalta (A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, pp. 35-36; Mark Montebello, Malta‚Äôs Philosophy & Philosophers, PIN Publications, Malta, 2011, pp. 118-201. Life Micallef was born in Victoria, Gozo, one of Malta's subsidiary islands, in 1923. After completing his studies at the Lyceum in Malta, he continued studying at the Gregorian University of Rome. From Gregorian, he acquired a Masters in Philosophy. He also studied philosophy at Heythop College in London, England. From the University of London he acquired a Bachelor of Arts in Italian Language, and another Master‚Äôs degree in Linguistics. He completed \\"3rd cycle\\" studies at Laval University in Quebec City, receiving a Doctorate in Philosophy. From the University of Western Colorado in the United States of America he acquired, in 1973, a second Doctorate in Arts. In 1980, he also acquired a Masters in Christian Studies from Regent College of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In addition to his prior studies, he pursued further coursework at the University of O√±a, in Spain, and at the University of Innsbruck, in Austria. During the fifties, Dr.John Micallef was a teacher of languages. He was elected and he served for some time as Member of the Malta Legislative Assembly before he emigrated from Malta to Canada in 1964. He eventually settled in Nelson, British Columbia, and then in Oregon, United States. In Nelson, he was Associate Professor of Philosophy at Notre Dame University of Nelson. He was also Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Portland, and at Mount Angel College, both in Oregon. Micallef died in 2003 in Vancouver, BC Canada. Work Philosophy of Existence,Ibid., Vol. I, p. 155 was published in 1969 (Philosophical Library, New York, U.S.A.). As its title indicates, in this 225-page composition, Micallef reveals his thorough Existentialist perspective. The book is basically divided into four parts, each one sub-divided into chapters. The composition is a highly elaborate philosophical exercise into the nature of existence. Successively, Micallef deals with the affirmation of existence, the process of existence, the properties of existence, and the dialectics of existence. Unfortunately, since the book was issued abroad, it has been seldom read in Malta. Consequently, its influence on the Maltese philosophical tradition has been relatively slight. Additional publications by John Micallef are: \\"No Destination- A Travellers Way\\" - a collection of poems and \\"Joy is my Gift\\" a collection of poems. Dr. Micallef was a prolific writer who produced numerous finished manuscripts and plays most of which remain unpublished to date.

Early life and career Dixon was born in Milton, Vermont, the son of Luther and Sarah (Seeger) Dixon. After obtaining a common school education, he studied law under Luke P. Poland, a judge on the Supreme Court of Vermont, who would later represent Vermont as a United States Senator and Congressman. Dixon was admitted to the bar in 1850. In 1851, Dixon traveled to Wisconsin and settled in Portage, in Columbia County, and started a legal practice. In 1852, Dixon was elected District Attorney of Columbia County, for a two-year term commencing January 1, 1853. He was re-elected for another two year term in 1854. =State of Wisconsin vs. John B. DuBay= In the year after his term as District Attorney expired, Dixon earned wide recognition for his prosecution of John Baptiste DuBay in his murder trial. DuBay had been involved in a property dispute with William Reynolds, and killed him after a confrontation. DuBay was a prominent character in the Wisconsin Territory and the early years of statehood. He was a celebrated pioneer character, connected to the American Fur Company, which was one of the most powerful businesses in the Wisconsin Territory. He was part French Canadian, part Menominee Indian, and served as an interpreter for many important negotiations with Wisconsin's Native American communities. DuBay's attorneys were both esteemed lawyers and prominent politicians--Moses M. Strong had been Speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, and had famously secured the acquittal of James Russell Vineyard after he had killed a fellow representative on the floor of the territorial legislature; Harlow S. Orton had been an attorney for Governor Coles Bashford when he successfully challenged the results of the 1855 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. The judge in the case, Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Alexander L. Collins, gave wide deference to the defense to bring in a number of prominent Wisconsin pioneers and statesmen to testify to the character of the defendant. DuBay was ultimately acquitted, but Dixon's reputation was secure. Within a year, he would take the place of the judge who had presided over the case, and within two years he would be Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Dixon later summarized that the real defendant in the trial was the \\"pioneer spirit,\\" and that DuBay's crimes went unpunished due to a parade of prominent Wisconsin pioneer character witnesses, which muddied the facts of the crime. Wisconsin judiciary Bust of Justice Dixon at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin. In 1858, Alexander Collins resigned his seat as Judge of the 9th Circuit. The new Governor, Alexander Randall, appointed Dixon to the seat, which had jurisdiction over Columbia, Dane, Jefferson, and Sauk counties. Less than a year later, in April 1859, Chief Justice Edward V. Whiton died suddenly. Governor Randall again turned to Dixon, naming him Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court at the age of 33. Only months after his appointment as Chief Justice, Dixon ran into controversy when he dissented from the majority of the court which had voted to ignore the ruling of the United States Supreme Court in the case of _Ableman v. Booth_. The Wisconsin Supreme Court had previously ruled that the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was unconstitutional, a position which was popular with the ascendant abolitionist Republican party in Wisconsin. The Supreme Court overruled the Wisconsin Court, ruling that state courts could not annul federal laws. Dixon wrote in favor of accepting the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that while he personally believed the Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional, he agreed with the federal court's interpretation of their jurisdiction. His dissent resulted in him losing the support of the Republican Party for his re-election in 1860. Nevertheless, he was able to obtain re-election as an independent. And was re-elected two more times after that. Dixon resigned from the court in 1874 to return to private legal practice. He distinguished himself again in this phase, representing the State of Wisconsin in upholding the constitutionality of the state's railroad regulation \\"Granger\\" laws. Family and personal life Luther Dixon married Mary Eliza Woods. They had five children together, though only four survived to adulthood. Dixon suffered from asthma and moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1879 for the health benefits, though he maintained a home in Wisconsin as well. He died in 1891 while visiting Milwaukee on his way back from a trip to Washington, D.C.

The vertebral column is the defining characteristic of a vertebrate in which the notochord (a flexible rod of uniform composition) found in all chordates has been replaced by a segmented series of bone: vertebrae separated by intervertebral discs. The vertebral column houses the spinal canal, a cavity that encloses and protects the spinal cord. There are about 50,000 species of animals that have a vertebral column. The human vertebral column is one of the most-studied examples.  Structure  In a human's vertebral column, there are normally thirty-three vertebrae; the upper twenty-four are articulating and separated from each other by intervertebral discs, and the lower nine are fused in adults, five in the sacrum and four in the coccyx, or tailbone. The articulating vertebrae are named according to their region of the spine. There are seven cervical vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae and five lumbar vertebrae. The number of vertebrae in a region can vary but overall the number remains the same. The number of those in the cervical region, however, is only rarely changed, while that in the coccygeal region varies most. There are ligaments extending the length of the column at the front and the back, and in between the vertebrae joining the spinous processes, the transverse processes and the vertebral laminae. =Vertebrae= Numbering order of the vertebrae of the human spinal column The vertebrae in the human vertebral column are divided into different regions, which correspond to the curves of the spinal column. The articulating vertebrae are named according to their region of the spine. Vertebrae in these regions are essentially alike, with minor variation. These regions are called the cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, sacrum, and coccyx. There are seven cervical vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae, and five lumbar vertebrae. The number of vertebrae in a region can vary but overall the number remains the same. The number of those in the cervical region, however, is only rarely changed. The vertebrae of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spines are independent bones and generally quite similar. The vertebrae of the sacrum and coccyx are usually fused and unable to move independently. Two special vertebrae are the atlas and axis, on which the head rests. Anatomy of a vertebra A typical vertebra consists of two parts: the vertebral body and the vertebral arch. The vertebral arch is posterior, meaning it faces the back of a person. Together, these enclose the vertebral foramen, which contains the spinal cord. Because the spinal cord ends in the lumbar spine, and the sacrum and coccyx are fused, they do not contain a central foramen. The vertebral arch is formed by a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, and supports seven processes, four articular, two transverse, and one spinous, the latter also being known as the neural spine. Two transverse processes and one spinous process are posterior to (behind) the vertebral body. The spinous process comes out the back, one transverse process comes out the left, and one on the right. The spinous processes of the cervical and lumbar regions can be felt through the skin. Above and below each vertebra are joints called facet joints. These restrict the range of movement possible, and are joined by a thin portion of the neural arch called the pars interarticularis. In between each pair of vertebrae are two small holes called intervertebral foramina. The spinal nerves leave the spinal cord through these holes. Individual vertebrae are named according to their region and position. From top to bottom, the vertebrae are: * Cervical spine: 7 vertebrae (C1‚ÄìC7) * Thoracic spine: 12 vertebrae (T1‚ÄìT12) * Lumbar spine: 5 vertebrae (L1‚ÄìL5) * Sacrum: 5 (fused) vertebrae (S1‚ÄìS5) * Coccyx: 4 (3‚Äì5) (fused) vertebrae (Tailbone) The combined region of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is known as the thoracolumbar division, or region. =Shape= The upper cervical spine has a curve, convex forward, that begins at the axis (second cervical vertebra) at the apex of the odontoid process or dens and ends at the middle of the second thoracic vertebra; it is the least marked of all the curves. This inward curve is known as a lordotic curve. A thoracic spine X-ray of a 57-year-old male. The thoracic curve, concave forward, begins at the middle of the second and ends at the middle of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Its most prominent point behind corresponds to the spinous process of the seventh thoracic vertebra. This curve is known as a kyphotic curve. Lateral lumbar X-ray of a 34-year-old male The lumbar curve is more marked in the female than in the male; it begins at the middle of the last thoracic vertebra, and ends at the sacrovertebral angle. It is convex anteriorly, the convexity of the lower three vertebrae being much greater than that of the upper two. This curve is described as a lordotic curve. The sacral curve begins at the sacrovertebral articulation, and ends at the point of the coccyx; its concavity is directed downward and forward as a kyphotic curve. The thoracic and sacral kyphotic curves are termed primary curves, because they are present in the fetus. The cervical and lumbar curves are compensatory, or secondary, and are developed after birth. The cervical curve forms when the infant is able to hold up its head (at three or four months) and sit upright (at nine months). The lumbar curve forms later from twelve to eighteen months, when the child begins to walk. =Surfaces= ;Anterior surface When viewed from in front, the width of the bodies of the vertebrae is seen to increase from the second cervical to the first thoracic; there is then a slight diminution in the next three vertebrae. Below this, there is again a gradual and progressive increase in width as low as the sacrovertebral angle. From this point there is a rapid diminution, to the apex of the coccyx.Gray's Anatomy (1918) ;Posterior surface From behind, the vertebral column presents in the median line the spinous processes. In the cervical region (with the exception of the second and seventh vertebrae), these are short, horizontal, and bifid. In the upper part of the thoracic region they are directed obliquely downward; in the middle they are almost vertical, and in the lower part they are nearly horizontal. In the lumbar region they are nearly horizontal. The spinous processes are separated by considerable intervals in the lumbar region, by narrower intervals in the neck, and are closely approximated in the middle of the thoracic region. Occasionally one of these processes deviates a little from the median line ‚Äî which can sometimes be indicative of a fracture or a displacement of the spine. On either side of the spinous processes is the vertebral groove formed by the laminae in the cervical and lumbar regions, where it is shallow, and by the laminae and transverse processes in the thoracic region, where it is deep and broad; these grooves lodge the deep muscles of the back. Lateral to the spinous processes are the articular processes, and still more laterally the transverse processes. In the thoracic region, the transverse processes stand backward, on a plane considerably behind that of the same processes in the cervical and lumbar regions. In the cervical region, the transverse processes are placed in front of the articular processes, lateral to the pedicles and between the intervertebral foramina. In the thoracic region they are posterior to the pedicles, intervertebral foramina, and articular processes. In the lumbar region they are in front of the articular processes, but behind the intervertebral foramina. ;Lateral surfaces The sides of the vertebral column are separated from the posterior surface by the articular processes in the cervical and thoracic regions and by the transverse processes in the lumbar region. In the thoracic region, the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae are marked in the back by the facets for articulation with the heads of the ribs. More posteriorly are the intervertebral foramina, formed by the juxtaposition of the vertebral notches, oval in shape, smallest in the cervical and upper part of the thoracic regions and gradually increasing in size to the last lumbar. They transmit the special spinal nerves and are situated between the transverse processes in the cervical region and in front of them, in the thoracic and lumbar regions. Ligaments There are different ligaments involved in the holding together of the vertebrae in the column, and in the column's movement. The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments extend the length of the vertebral column along the front and back of the vertebral bodies. The interspinous ligaments connect the adjoining spinous processes of the vertebrae. The supraspinous ligament extends the length of the spine running along the back of the spinous processes, from the sacrum to the seventh cervical vertebra. From there it is continuous with the nuchal ligament. =Development= The striking segmented pattern of the spine is established during embryogenesis when somites are rhythmically added to the posterior of the embryo. Somite formation begins around the third week when the embryo begins gastrulation and continues until all somites are formed. Their number varies between species: there are 42 to 44 somites in the human embryo and around 52 in the chick embryo. The somites are spheres, formed from the paraxial mesoderm that lies at the sides of the neural tube and they contain the precursors of spinal bone, the vertebrae ribs and some of the skull, as well as muscle, ligaments and skin. Somitogenesis and the subsequent distribution of somites is controlled by a clock and wavefront model acting in cells of the paraxial mesoderm. Soon after their formation, sclerotomes, which give rise to some of the bone of the skull, the vertebrae and ribs, migrate, leaving the remainder of the somite now termed a dermamyotome behind. This then splits to give the myotomes which will form the muscles and dermatomes which will form the skin of the back. Sclerotomes become subdivided into an anterior and a posterior compartment. This subdivision plays a key role in the definitive patterning of vertebrae that form when the posterior part of one somite fuses to the anterior part of the consecutive somite during a process termed resegmentation. Disruption of the somitogenesis process in humans results in diseases such as congenital scoliosis. So far, the human homologues of three genes associated to the mouse segmentation clock, (MESP2, DLL3 and LFNG), have been shown to be mutated in cases of congenital scoliosis, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in vertebral segmentation are conserved across vertebrates. In humans the first four somites are incorporated in the base of the occipital bone of the skull and the next 33 somites will form the vertebrae, ribs, muscles, ligaments and skin. The remaining posterior somites degenerate. During the fourth week of embryogenesis, the sclerotomes shift their position to surround the spinal cord and the notochord. This column of tissue has a segmented appearance, with alternating areas of dense and less dense areas. As the sclerotome develops, it condenses further eventually developing into the vertebral body. Development of the appropriate shapes of the vertebral bodies is regulated by HOX genes. The less dense tissue that separates the sclerotome segments develop into the intervertebral discs. The notochord disappears in the sclerotome (vertebral body) segments but persists in the region of the intervertebral discs as the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus and the fibers of the anulus fibrosus make up the intervertebral disc. The primary curves (thoracic and sacral curvatures) form during fetal development. The secondary curves develop after birth. The cervical curvature forms as a result of lifting the head and the lumbar curvature forms as a result of walking.  Function  =Spinal cord= The spinal cord nested in the vertebral column. The vertebral column surrounds the spinal cord which travels within the spinal canal, formed from a central hole within each vertebra. The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system that supplies nerves and receives information from the peripheral nervous system within the body. The spinal cord consists of grey and white matter and a central cavity, the central canal. Adjacent to each vertebra emerge spinal nerves. The spinal nerves provide sympathetic nervous supply to the body, with nerves emerging forming the sympathetic trunk and the splanchnic nerves. The spinal canal follows the different curves of the column; it is large and triangular in those parts of the column that enjoy the greatest freedom of movement, such as the cervical and lumbar regions, and is small and rounded in the thoracic region, where motion is more limited. 3D Medical Animation still shot of Spina Bifida The spinal cord terminates in the conus medullaris and cauda equina. Clinical significance =Disease= Spina bifida is a congenital disorder in which there is a defective closure of the vertebral arch. Sometimes the spinal meninges and also the spinal cord can protrude through this, and this is called Spina bifida cystica. Where the condition does not involve this protrusion it is known as Spina bifida occulta. Sometimes all of the vertebral arches may remain incomplete. Another, though rare, congenital disease is Klippel‚ÄìFeil syndrome, which is the fusion of any two of the cervical vertebrae. Spondylolisthesis is the forward displacement of a vertebra and retrolisthesis is a posterior displacement of one vertebral body with respect to the adjacent vertebra to a degree less than a dislocation. Spondylolysis, also known as a pars defect, is a defect or fracture at the pars interarticularis of the vertebral arch. Spinal disc herniation, more commonly called a \\"slipped disc\\", is the result of a tear in the outer ring (anulus fibrosus) of the intervertebral disc, which lets some of the soft gel-like material, the nucleus pulposus, bulge out in a hernia. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal which can occur in any region of the spine though less commonly in the thoracic region. The stenosis can constrict the spinal canal giving rise to a neurological deficit. Pain at the coccyx (tailbone) is known as coccydynia. Spinal cord injury is damage to the spinal cord that causes changes in its function, either temporary or permanent. Spinal cord injuries can be divided into categories: complete transection, hemisection, central spinal cord lesions, posterior spinal cord lesions, and anterior spinal cord lesions. Scalloping vertebrae is the increase in the concavity of the posterior vertebral body. It can be seen on lateral X-ray and sagittal views of CT and MRI scans. Its concavity is due to the increased pressure exerting on the vertebrae due to a mass. Internal spinal mass such as spinal astrocytoma, ependymoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, and achondroplasia causes vertebrae scalloping. =Curvature= Diagram showing normal curvature of the vertebrae from childhood to teenage Excessive or abnormal spinal curvature is classed as a spinal disease or dorsopathy and includes the following abnormal curvatures: * Kyphosis is an exaggerated kyphotic (convex) curvature of the thoracic region in the sagittal plane, also called hyperkyphosis. This produces the so-called \\"humpback\\" or \\"dowager's hump\\", a condition commonly resulting from osteoporosis. * Lordosis is an exaggerated lordotic (concave) curvature of the lumbar region in the sagittal plane, is known as lumbar hyperlordosis and also as \\"swayback\\". Temporary lordosis is common during pregnancy. * Scoliosis, lateral curvature, is the most common abnormal curvature, occurring in 0.5% of the population. It is more common among females and may result from unequal growth of the two sides of one or more vertebrae, so that they do not fuse properly. It can also be caused by pulmonary atelectasis (partial or complete deflation of one or more lobes of the lungs) as observed in asthma or pneumothorax. * Kyphoscoliosis, a combination of kyphosis and scoliosis. =Anatomical landmarks= Surface projections of organs of the torso. The transpyloric line is seen at L1 Individual vertebrae of the human vertebral column can be felt and used as surface anatomy, with reference points are taken from the middle of the vertebral body. This provides anatomical landmarks that can be used to guide procedures such as a lumbar puncture and also as vertical reference points to describe the locations of other parts of human anatomy, such as the positions of organs. Other animals =Variations in vertebrae= The general structure of vertebrae in other animals is largely the same as in humans. Individual vertebrae are composed of a centrum (body), arches protruding from the top and bottom of the centrum, and various processes projecting from the centrum and/or arches. An arch extending from the top of the centrum is called a neural arch, while the haemal arch or chevron is found underneath the centrum in the caudal (tail) vertebrae of fish, most reptiles, some birds, some dinosaurs and some mammals with long tails. The vertebral processes can either give the structure rigidity, help them articulate with ribs, or serve as muscle attachment points. Common types are transverse process, diapophyses, parapophyses, and zygapophyses (both the cranial zygapophyses and the caudal zygapophyses). The centrum of the vertebra can be classified based on the fusion of its elements. In temnospondyls, bones such as the spinous process, the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum are separate ossifications. Fused elements, however, classify a vertebra as having holospondyly. A vertebra can also be described in terms of the shape of the ends of the centrum. Centra with flat ends are acoelous, like those in mammals. These flat ends of the centra are especially good at supporting and distributing compressive forces. Amphicoelous vertebra have centra with both ends concave. This shape is common in fish, where most motion is limited. Amphicoelous centra often are integrated with a full notochord. Procoelous vertebrae are anteriorly concave and posteriorly convex. They are found in frogs and modern reptiles. Opisthocoelous vertebrae are the opposite, possessing anterior convexity and posterior concavity. They are found in salamanders, and in some non-avian dinosaurs. Heterocoelous vertebrae have saddle-shaped articular surfaces. This type of configuration is seen in turtles that retract their necks, and birds, because it permits extensive lateral and vertical flexion motion without stretching the nerve cord too extensively or wringing it about its long axis. In horses, the Arabian (breed) can have one less vertebrae and pair of ribs. This anomaly disappears in foals that are the product of an Arabian and another breed of horse.Edwards, The Arabian, pp. 27‚Äì28 =Regional vertebrae= Vertebrae are defined by the regions of the vertebral column that they occur in, as in humans. Cervical vertebrae are those in the neck area. With the exception of the two sloth genera (Choloepus and Bradypus) and the manatee genus, (Trichechus), all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae. In other vertebrates, the number of cervical vertebrae can range from a single vertebra in amphibians to as many as 25 in swans or 76 in the extinct plesiosaur Elasmosaurus. The dorsal vertebrae range from the bottom of the neck to the top of the pelvis. Dorsal vertebrae attached to the ribs are called thoracic vertebrae, while those without ribs are called lumbar vertebrae. The sacral vertebrae are those in the pelvic region, and range from one in amphibians, to two in most birds and modern reptiles, or up to three to five in mammals. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum. The synsacrum is a similar fused structure found in birds that is composed of the sacral, lumbar, and some of the thoracic and caudal vertebra, as well as the pelvic girdle. Caudal vertebrae compose the tail, and the final few can be fused into the pygostyle in birds, or into the coccygeal or tail bone in chimpanzees (and humans). =Fish and amphibians= ray-finned fish The vertebrae of lobe-finned fishes consist of three discrete bony elements. The vertebral arch surrounds the spinal cord, and is of broadly similar form to that found in most other vertebrates. Just beneath the arch lies a small plate-like pleurocentrum, which protects the upper surface of the notochord, and below that, a larger arch-shaped intercentrum to protect the lower border. Both of these structures are embedded within a single cylindrical mass of cartilage. A similar arrangement was found in the primitive Labyrinthodonts, but in the evolutionary line that led to reptiles (and hence, also to mammals and birds), the intercentrum became partially or wholly replaced by an enlarged pleurocentrum, which in turn became the bony vertebral body. In most ray-finned fishes, including all teleosts, these two structures are fused with, and embedded within, a solid piece of bone superficially resembling the vertebral body of mammals. In living amphibians, there is simply a cylindrical piece of bone below the vertebral arch, with no trace of the separate elements present in the early tetrapods. In cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, the vertebrae consist of two cartilaginous tubes. The upper tube is formed from the vertebral arches, but also includes additional cartilaginous structures filling in the gaps between the vertebrae, and so enclosing the spinal cord in an essentially continuous sheath. The lower tube surrounds the notochord, and has a complex structure, often including multiple layers of calcification. Lampreys have vertebral arches, but nothing resembling the vertebral bodies found in all higher vertebrates. Even the arches are discontinuous, consisting of separate pieces of arch-shaped cartilage around the spinal cord in most parts of the body, changing to long strips of cartilage above and below in the tail region. Hagfishes lack a true vertebral column, and are therefore not properly considered vertebrates, but a few tiny neural arches are present in the tail. =Other vertebrates= Vertebral anatomy of a human spine The general structure of human vertebrae is fairly typical of that found in mammals, reptiles, and birds. The shape of the vertebral body does, however, vary somewhat between different groups. In mammals, such as humans, it typically has flat upper and lower surfaces, while in reptiles the anterior surface commonly has a concave socket into which the expanded convex face of the next vertebral body fits. Even these patterns are only generalisations, however, and there may be variation in form of the vertebrae along the length of the spine even within a single species. Some unusual variations include the saddle-shaped sockets between the cervical vertebrae of birds and the presence of a narrow hollow canal running down the centre of the vertebral bodies of geckos and tuataras, containing a remnant of the notochord. Reptiles often retain the primitive intercentra, which are present as small crescent-shaped bony elements lying between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae; similar structures are often found in the caudal vertebrae of mammals. In the tail, these are attached to chevron-shaped bones called haemal arches, which attach below the base of the spine, and help to support the musculature. These latter bones are probably homologous with the ventral ribs of fish. The number of vertebrae in the spines of reptiles is highly variable, and may be several hundred in some species of snake. In birds, there is a variable number of cervical vertebrae, which often form the only truly flexible part of the spine. The thoracic vertebrae are partially fused, providing a solid brace for the wings during flight. The sacral vertebrae are fused with the lumbar vertebrae, and some thoracic and caudal vertebrae, to form a single structure, the synsacrum, which is thus of greater relative length than the sacrum of mammals. In living birds, the remaining caudal vertebrae are fused into a further bone, the pygostyle, for attachment of the tail feathers. Aside from the tail, the number of vertebrae in mammals is generally fairly constant. There are almost always seven cervical vertebrae (sloths and manatees are among the few exceptions), followed by around twenty or so further vertebrae, divided between the thoracic and lumbar forms, depending on the number of ribs. There are generally three to five vertebrae with the sacrum, and anything up to fifty caudal vertebrae. =Dinosaurs= The vertebral column in dinosaurs consists of the cervical (neck), dorsal (back), sacral (hips), and caudal (tail) vertebrae. Saurischian dinosaur vertebrae sometimes possess features known as pleurocoels, which are hollow depressions on the lateral portions of the vertebrae, perforated to create an entrance into the air chambers within the vertebrae, which served to decrease the weight of these bones without sacrificing strength. These pleurocoels were filled with air sacs, which would have further decreased weight. In sauropod dinosaurs, the largest known land vertebrates, pleurocoels and air sacs may have reduced the animal's weight by over a ton in some instances, a handy evolutionary adaption in animals that grew to over 30 metres in length. In many hadrosaur and theropod dinosaurs, the caudal vertebrae were reinforced by ossified tendons. The presence of three or more sacral vertebrae, in association with the hip bones, is one of the defining characteristics of dinosaurs. The occipital condyle is a structure on the posterior part of a dinosaur's skull that articulates with the first cervical vertebra.

He remained there until October 1632, thus negotiating an end to the conflict between the Mughals and the Safavids.

After celebrating the new year at Tabas Gilaki in southern Khorasan, Abbas joined with his army and marched on Kandahar where he arrived on 20 May and immediately began the siege.

After some time, in 2015, GigaTribe announced collaborative storage with \\"GiGa.GG\\". They created a cloud service with a capability of sharing files with anyone by uploading them on the servers of the company. The amount of storage in free accounts was limited by 100 GB at first, but then, GiGa.GG decided to switch to a paid distribution model. Now, it is available to purchase an account with 100 GB, 1 TB or 2 TB (1.99 ‚Ç¨, 5.99 ‚Ç¨ and 9.99 ‚Ç¨ respectively) with a possibility to get a free account for a month. History On its way to the latest version, GigaTribe has undergone many changes. At first, this software was known as TribalWeb until 2.4.4.0, which was then followed with the redesign of the product in 3.00.002. Many updated versions have been released over the years, including the newer Mac and Linux versions. As of May 2020, the latest version (3.06.004) runs on the three main operating system series (Windows ‚Äì MacOS ‚Äì Linux) and now enables users to find other users with similar interests (via the recent introduction of # hashtags). Design In GigaTribe, there is a P2P connection between users, however the files are not being shared in public. You can choose to whom you need to send the files and they will be transferred directly to the computer of that particular user. Files may go through the servers of GigaTribe company (if VPN connection is chosen), but they are still being encrypted on the way to the receiver. API Gigatribe API is a collection of HTTP GET/POST services exposing Gigatribe functions to developers. The purpose is to help developers build their Gigatribe applications with less effort. The applications will be able to perform inviting users, joining tribes, reading contacts information, etc, outside the desktop version of Gigatribe software, for example, in a web forum. So as to enable developers to compose less code to call an API, GigaTribe team developed a customer library, which embodied the code for requesting for authorization code, access token and the code for calling an API, that works on PHP. In terms of security, these services use OAuth 2.0, which is an open-standard protocol for authorization.

G. Grace‚Äôs career occurred in the 1876 season, beginning with his career highest score of 344 for MCC v Kent at Canterbury in August. Two days after his innings at Canterbury, he made 177 for Gloucestershire v Nottinghamshire; and two days after that 318 not out for Gloucestershire v Yorkshire, these two innings against counties with exceptionally strong bowling attacks including Alfred Shaw, Fred Morley, Tom Emmett and Allen Hill. Thus, in three consecutive innings Grace scored 839 runs and was only out twice. His innings of 344 was the first triple century scored in first-class cricket and broke the record for the highest individual score in all classes of cricket, previously held by William Ward who made 278 in 1820.

His successful representation of Ezekiel Gillespie in the 1866 case of Gillespie v. Palmer resulted in the legal recognition of voting rights for African Americans in Wisconsin. Early life and career Paine was born in Painesville, Ohio, to General James H. Paine and Marilla Paine. He moved to Milwaukee in 1847 with his father and studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1849, and entered a legal partnership, Jas. H. Paine & Sons, with his father and his brother, Hortensius. As a young lawyer, he was a close friend of the abolitionist Sherman Booth. And in 1854, when Booth was on trial for violating the Fugitive Slave Act, Paine represented him as his lawyer without compensation. Paine argued on his behalf in front of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, in the case of Ableman v. Booth. At Paine's funeral, Justice Harlow S. Orton remarked that he had, \\"made one of the clearest, most conclusive and most eloquent arguments against the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law made in any court in the country.\\" Paine won the case and became the only lawyer to successfully argue that fugitive slave laws violated the sovereignty of the northern states. Although the United States Supreme Court did eventually overrule the Wisconsin decision. Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Edward George Ryan, who had opposed Paine in the Booth case as attorney for the United States, said of him, \\"The first opportunity I had of forming an estimate of his high ability, was in the famous case under the fugitive slave act, in 1854 and 1855. He was employed for the defendant; I, for the United States. We both brought to the case, not only ordinary professional zeal, but all the prejudices of all our lives. He was a frank and manly abolitionist. I was as decidedly what was called pro-slavery. We were both thoroughly in earnest...I thought him a fanatic. He probably thought me one. Possibly we both were.\\" In the 1856 session of the Wisconsin State Senate, Paine served as Chief Clerk. In 1857 he was elected Judge in Milwaukee County, where he served until his election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1859. Civil War Service Paine's term on the Supreme Court was set to expire in 1865, but in the midst of the American Civil War, in 1864, Paine chose to resign from the Court and enlist with the Union Army. He was commissioned as lieutenant colonel for the newly raised 43rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, serving under Colonel Amasa Cobb. The regiment was assigned to Tennessee, and saw some combat during the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign near the end of the war. Later years and 2nd Supreme Court term After the Civil War, Paine returned to Milwaukee and resumed practicing law. During this period, he participated in another significant civil rights case, when he represented Ezekiel Gillespie in the 1866 case of Gillespie v. Palmer. Gillespie was a former slave who attempted to vote in Milwaukee in 1865, but was turned away. Paine argued that Wisconsin had granted voting rights to African Americans through an 1849 law and referendum, which had been ignored for the previous 17 years. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in Gillespie's favor, ruling that African Americans had the right to vote in Wisconsin. In 1867, Jason Downer, who had succeeded Paine on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, resigned. Wisconsin Governor Lucius Fairchild appointed Paine to fill the vacancy. Paine served on the Supreme Court until his death in January 1871. Family and personal life Paine married Clarissa Wyman. They had five sons, though only three survived infancy. He was an avid reader and enjoyed studying theology. Paine died on January 13, 1871, in Monona, Wisconsin.

Over the previous few years, divisions had emerged within the Whig party between the 'court' supporters of the junto and the 'country' faction, who disliked the royal prerogative, were concerned about governmental corruption, and opposed a standing army. Some contests were therefore between candidates representing 'court' and 'country', rather than Whig and Tory. The Whigs made gains in the counties and in small boroughs, but not in the larger urban constituencies. Increasingly, however, the Tories and the country Whigs managed to wear down the government's resolve and win over dissident Whig MPs.

In 1986 the organisation was involved in a protest in the town of Monmouth when it became apparent that developers had not only discovered important archaeological remains but had already destroyed them. Members of the society anticipated that more damage was to follow and the local council were implicated. One of the archaeologists was made an MBE for their part in this work. The society ran the largest long standing urban amateur excavation in the UK, at 22‚Äì24 Monnow Street, Monmouth from 1990‚Äì2000. Objects unearthed ranged from the Mesolithic period to the present day. These included coins, pottery, bones, and glass. The excavation found a medieval defensive castle ditch, a well with cesspit nearby, a Roman grave with standing stone marker, and possible evidence of a building along Monnow Street during the Dark Age. The current chair of Monmouth Archaeological Society is Stephen Clarke. Members include Stuart Wilson, Arthur Sockett and Dave Jemmett. The society won the Pitt Rivers Award in 1988 and the Silver Trowel Award for the greatest initiative in Archaeology. The constitution still states the membership fee to be 5 shillings.

Ryyty Apparel Resources India is a rebrand of Butonia (India) Ltd. The Butonia group originated in mid-19th century Germany and spread throughout Western Europe and Asia in the 20th century. Ryyty offers a range of buttons, zippers, fastenings, click-locks, buckles, cord ends etc. for the garment, backpack, textile and related industries. Ryyty also specialises in providing support to textile companies worldwide, from initial design to final manufacture. The original company was founded in 1865 by Zadok Alexander Frankel in Frankfurt, Germany under the name Z.A. Frankel GmbH. Zadok Alexander Frankel's widow, Regina Frankel, continued to run the company for over 40 years, after his early demise. The company was then jointly run by Max Frankel, Regina's son, and Salomon Stiebel, her son-in-law, until the 1930s-1940s. Subsequently thereto, the greatly expanded corporate group was managed from London by Ernest Frankel, Max's son, and Richard Stiebel, Salomon's son, until the late 1980s-1990s. The company expanded outside Germany under the name Butonia in the early 20th century to Britain, Switzerland and the Netherlands and after the Second World War to Sweden, Belgium and Finland. In the 1930s the original German company was expropriated from its German-Jewish owners, the Frankel-Stiebel family, by the Nazi regime and renamed KHG - Knopf Handelsgesellschaft GmbH, a formal name that the German Butonia company still bears today. In the 1930s, the Frankel-Stiebel family relocated to London, England and the British company, Butonia (London) Ltd., became the main group company. In the Netherlands, the Guggenheim family were partners in Butonia BV with the British shareholders prior to the Second World War, became joint shareholders of the entire group in 1994 and bought out the European companies from the Frankel-Stiebel families in 2002. In 1997 and 2000, respectively, Butonia opened subsidiaries in Bangalore, India and Hong Kong. These businesses were taken over by the Ruby Enterprises group in late 2002, headed by Ilan Shavit, the son of Richard Stiebel, the grandson of Salomon Stiebel and the great-grandson of Zadok Alexander Frankel. Ilan Shavit serves as the current Chairman of Ryyty. Butonia India was rebranded as ryyty in 2011. The source of the name is \\"fashion\\" in Sanskrit and \\"spice\\" in Finnish. One such spice is Saffron, an important colour in India and Hinduism, known in Hebrew and Arabic as Zafran, evocative of the original name of the company, Z.A. Frankel, founded in Germany in 1865.

This measure helped to fuel partisan rivalry over the coming decades, with the electorate in a constant state of excitement and the Whigs and Tories continually trying to gain the upper hand. Despite the potential for manipulation of the electorate, as was seen under Robert Walpole and his successors, with general elections held an average of every other year, and local and central government positions frequently changing hands between parties, it was impossible for any party or government to be certain of electoral success in the period after 1694, and election results were consequently genuinely representative of the views of at least the section of the population able to vote. The election of 1695, however, was comparatively quiet, being fought mainly on local issues. The new government led by the Whig junto made gains in most contested constituencies, and their party was returned with a narrow majority. The junto's support was not certain, however, as their policies increasingly alienated backbench 'country' Whigs, who were willing to co-operate with the Tories, and the government frequently ran into trouble in the House of Commons.

Dheevaras receive a mention in the Mahabharat, where they are said to be a tribe of fishermen. In the Dogri language, the term jheer was often used for a cook. This community may have acquired the name Jheer on account of the fact that members of the community were employed as cooks. The Jheer are a caste associated with water carrying and may be connected with the Jhinwar caste of Indian Punjab. Like the Jhinwar and the Kahar of North India, the Jheer were also employed as palanquin bearers.People of India Jammu and Kashmir Volume XXV edited by K.N Pandita, S.D.S Charak & B.R.

They speak the Dogri language, and their customs and traditions are similar to the locally dominant Dogra community.  Present circumstances  Like most other North Indian Hindu castes, the Jheer consists of number of clans, with strict rules of clan exogamy.

They are also strictly endogamous, and occupy their own quarters in villages. This was historically a landless community, traditionally associated with fishing, water carrying and palanquin bearing. Many were granted lands as part of the land reform carried out by the Government of India, just after independence in 1947. Most of them are involved in small businesses, especially restaurant /dhaba business, a trade in which the Jhinwar/Dhimar/Jheer have a monopoly in North India.

Although officially named the Jackson Light Artillery, it was the practice in the Confederate Army to refer to a battery by the name of its current commander; thus, it is variously identified in most contemporary records as McCown's Battery, Hubbard's Battery, and Thrall's Battery.

Many Confederate artillery units seem to have begun the war named for the city or county that sponsored their organization. In the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, artillery units are most often referred to by the name of their battery commander. During the war, efforts were made to organize artillery units into battalions and regiments, but the battalions seldom functioned as a consolidated organization, in fact batteries were often broken out and fought as one or two gun sections. Shoup's battalion would be an exception to this rule.Confederate military history: a library of Confederate States history, Volume 10, Page 334, Accessed 21 February 2013, https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ9YAAAAMAAJ&pg;=RA1-PA327&lpg;=RA1-PA334&dq;=Shoup's+Arkansas+Artillery+Battalion&source;=bl&ots;=5cqzLPSpO0&sig;=w_JxMQTxP2Wp2WOErXC1Wb390Dc&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=ZKEmUbGyIMWs2wXGnoCwBA&sqi;=2&ved;=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;=Shoup's%20Arkansas%20Artillery%20Battalion&f;=false Service A 3 Inch Rifled GunThe battery, as part of Shoup's Battalion moved to central Kentucky with Hardee's forces.United States.

In response, an angry Forrest threatened to kill Bragg if he attempted to give him any further orders. This dispute compelled Confederate President Jefferson Davis to transfer Forrest to Mississippi to raise a new corps from western Tennessee; this transfer placed him under the command of Stephen D. Lee's Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. In December 1863 Forrest led a raid/recruiting mission into Western Tennessee and eventually organized his recruits into two divisions commanded by James R. Chalmers and Abraham Buford number over 3000 men.Wills, pp. 142-157, 169-171. Forrest moved his newly recruited force to Commo, Mississippi, which is probably where Thrall's battery joined the new command. By January 25, 1864, Thrall's Battery was assigned to Forrest's command. In February 1864. Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman launched a two pronged attack eastward toward Meridian, Mississippi.Meridian, Mississippi, Official Website Meridian was an important railroad center and was home to a Confederate arsenal, military hospital, and prisoner-of-war stockade, as well as the headquarters for a number of state offices.History of Meridian, Mississippi Sherman planned to take Meridian and, if the situation was favorable, push on to Selma, Alabama, and possibly even threaten Mobile, Alabama. While Sherman set out on February 3, 1864, with the main force of 20,000 men from Vicksburg, he ordered Brig. Gen. William Sooy Smith to lead a cavalry force of 7,000 men from Memphis, Tennessee, south through Okolona, Mississippi, along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to meet the rest of the Union force at Meridian. As the campaigned opened, Thrall's battery was mentioned is several dispatches. On January 19, 1864, Lieutenant General Lineous Polk wrote to Major General Forrest and inquired, \\"Have you ordered Thrall's battery at Columbus over to General Chalmers?

Smith never reached Meridian; he and his troops encountered resistance from Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest at West Point, Mississippi. Forrest and his army forced Smith to begin to retreat to Tennessee. When Forrest saw Smith's army retreating, he ordered his troops to chase the army down. Forrest, with Thrall's battery, caught up with Smith and defeated them in the Battle of Okolona on February 22, 1864, which ultimately resulted in General Sherman's entire left flank being eliminated during the campaign.American Civil War - Destruction of Meridian The battery participated in the Battle of Okolona, Mississippi, on February 22, 1864. Next the battery, or at least the rifled section of the battery, was involved in the Affair at Yazoo City. Brigadier General R. V. Richardson filed a report on March 7, 1864, that described the battery's part in this action: The battery is included in a May 10, 1864, report of the organization of Forrest's Cavalry, as being assigned to Brigadier General Abraham Buford's Division.United States.

In June Union General Samuel D. Sturgis led an expedition into northern Mississippi to keep Forrest from raiding Union supply lines during the Atlanta Campaign. On June 10, Forrest, with Thrall's battery, attacked Sturgis in the Battle of Brice's Crossroads and routed the Union force. Despite losing nearly 500 men, he inflicted over 2,200 casualties and captured 16 cannons, 176 wagons, and 1,500 small arms.National Park Service, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System, Confederate Arkansas Troops, Thrall's Battery, Arkansas Light Artillery, Accessed Jan 14, 2011, Wills, pp. 174-179, 199-214. During the Battle of Brice's Crossroads, the gunners of Thrall's battery unlimbered their guns and pushed them by hand behind the advancing lines of infantry. In late June, Union Major General Andrew J. Smith launched another expedition into Mississippi to tie down the Confederate forces in the region. Forrest united with an infantry force commanded by Stephen Lee and attacked the Union forces near Harrisburg, Mississippi, on July 14; uncoordinated Confederate attacks on the Union right wing resulted in a Union victory. Only 3,500 of Forrest's and Lee's 7,000 men joined in the attack and 1,300 became casualties; Smith lost only 674 men. Despite his victory, Smith retreated from the field towards Tupolu, where Forrest attacked again the next day and was again defeated. During the battle, Forrest was wounded in the right thigh and was forced to turn command over to Chalmers.Hurst, pp. 198-208. During the Battle of Tupelo, Captain Thrall's Battery was ordered by Captain Morton to support Captain Rice's battery, and did effective service in saving Rice's Battery and protecting the withdrawal from the field of the shattered Kentucky Brigade.Morton, John Watson. The Artillery of Nathan Bedford Forrest's Cavalry, \\"the Wizard of the Saddle,\\". Nashville, Tenn: Publishing house of the M.E. church, South, Smith & Lamar, agents, 1909, 218. In mid-September, Forrest launched a raid into northern Alabama and central Tennessee to disrupt Sherman's supply lines, returning to northern Mississippi in early October. Although he was able to capture nearly 2,400 Union soldiers and many supplies, Sherman captured Atlanta in early September, before Forrest had started his raid. In Lieutenant General Richard Taylor's September 30, 1864, report of the troops in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana, the battery is still listed as belonging to Buford's Division of Major General Nathan B. Forrest's Cavalry Corps. During the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign, Thrall's Battery accompanied Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest on a 23-day raid through western Tennessee which culminated in an attack on the Union supply base at Johnsonville.Wills, pp. 250-272. On the evening of November 3, 1864, Forrest positioned his guns across the river from the Federal supply base at Johnsonville. On the morning of November 4, the Confederate batteries were attacked by three Union gunboats from Johnsonville and by six Paducah gunboats. The Confederate artillery was completely effective in neutralizing the threat of the Federal fleets. One of the vessels was hit 19 times, and returned to Johnsonville. Thrall's battery assisted in bombarding the Union supply depot and the 28 steamboats and barges positioned at the wharf. All three of the Union gunboats‚ÄîKey West, Tawah, and Elfin‚Äîwere disabled or destroyed. The Union garrison commander ordered that the supply vessels be burned to prevent their capture by the Confederates. Forrest observed, \\"By night the wharf for nearly one mile up and down the river presented one solid sheet of flame. ... Having completed the work designed for the expedition, I moved my command six miles during the night by the light of the enemy's burning property\\"Wills, Brian Steel. The Confederacy's Greatest Cavalryman: Nathan Bedford Forrest. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1992. , p.270-73. While assigned to General Forrest's command the battery had been given the nickname, the \\"Arkansas Rats\\". Following the success at Johnsonville, General Forrest announced that he was re-baptizing the unit as the \\"Arkansas Braves\\". One sergeant listening to the General's complements allegedly responded \\" General, talking may be very good, but something to eat would be a heap better: we have been living on wind for two days.\\" General Forrest responded by providing the battery with a feast of ham and hard tack from the stores of his own headquarters.Wyeth, John A. Life of General Nathan Bedford Forrest. New York, N.Y.: Harper & Bros, 1899, page 528. The battery is included in a November 20, 1864, abstract of Confederate forces in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana as being assigned to Chalmer's Division. At this time, Forrest was ordered to move into northern Alabama to unite with the Army of Tennessee, now commanded by John B. Hood. Hood was launching an invasion of central Tennessee and wanted Forrest's corps to replace the cavalry corps of Joseph Wheeler, who was on detached duty in Georgia. Thrall's Battery did not accompany Forrest to join Hood's army, but was assigned as part of the garrison of Corinth Mississippi. On November 27, 1864, Major J.W. Eldridge reported from Corinth, Mississippi, that the only battery currently present at Corinth was Thrall's Battery of four bass pieces. Eldridge indicated that at least 16 guns were needed to defend the fortifications around CorinthUnited States. War Dept..

The unit participated in the Battle of Spanish Fort, part of the Mobile Campaign, in April 1865. Union forces embarked on a land campaign in early 1865 to take Mobile from the east. Maj. Gen. E.R.S. Canby's XIII and XVI corps moved along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay forcing the Confederates back into their defenses. Union forces concentrated first on Spanish Fort, five miles to the north. On March 27, 1865, Canby's forces undertook a siege of Spanish Fort, which consisted of a semi-circular line of five redoubts stretching almost two miles long. The Union had enveloped the fort by April 1, and on April 8 captured it.

On April 12, 1865, Mobile was declared an open city and the remaining Confederate garrison retreated with the intention of joining the remains of the Army of Tennessee, then in North Carolina. The surrender of the Army of Tennessee to General Sherman on April 26, 1865, prevented that option and surrender of the Mobile garrison soon followed.

He is believed to have lived for a time in Boston and while there was found guilty of receiving stolen goods. His punishment was a flogging. He then moved to the New Haven Colony, and continued to be a \\"habitual troublemaker\\". He was open about his lack of faith, never praying in the years of being in Connecticut and only reading the Bible when forced to by his master.Cressy, David. Coming over: migration and communication between England and New England in the seventeenth century. Cambridge University Press. 1987. p.101. Accessed November 1, 2011.  Trial and execution  When a sow gave birth to a malformed, one-eyed piglet it was considered a manifestation of God's proof of Spencer's sins. Spencer was arrested, and the Puritan authorities deemed the birth a work of God. They believed that this was irrefutable evidence that an act of bestiality had taken place.Chapin, Bradley. Criminal Justice in Colonial America, 1606-1660. University of Georgia Press. 2010. pp.38‚Äì39. Accessed November 1, 2011. He was charged with \\"prophane, atheistical carriage, in unfaithfulness and stubbornness to his master, a course of notorious lying, filthiness, scoffing at the ordinances, ways and people of God\\". Spencer was told that \\"he that confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall finde mercie\\", but it was never made clear to him whether this mercy related to the proceedings of the court or those of God. Having witnessed a repentant child molester being whipped for his crime Spencer believed that his best option was to confess. On the realisation that this might lead to a death sentence he retracted his statement. He repeated this confession and retraction again, trying to find the best solution to his situation.Dikes, Jason. Massachusetts Sex Ways: Puritan Ideas of Flesh and the Spirit . Austin Community College. p.4. Accessed November 1, 2011. When the trial began the magistrates knew the necessity of having two witnesses to the crime. They used Spencer's retracted confessions as one witness and the stillborn piglet as the other, ruling that this was sufficient to determine his guilt. On April 8, 1642, the sow was put to death by the sword and Spencer was hanged. Spencer's death was early in the history of Connecticut and is reported to be only the second execution to take place in Connecticut and the first of a non-Native American.Executions is the U.S. 1608-2002: The ESPY File. Death Penalty Information Center. p.1. Accessed November 1, 2011.  Similar case  In 1645, Thomas Hogg, another servant in New Haven, was imprisoned for several months for very similar crimes.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The hall was originally a town house built in 1676 for Lady Mary Calverley. She had petitioned the City Assembly for permission to demolish her house, which contained a section of the Chester Rows, and replace it with a new house. This was granted, but as it led to the loss of a portion of the Rows she was fined ¬£20 (). It was the first building in central Chester to be designed in classical style. During the early 18th century the house was occupied by John Williams, a local attorney general. Since that time the building has been used for various purposes, including a school, a club, offices, and shops. The access to the building was altered in the late 19th century. Also in that century a sixth bay was added to the north, and in the later part of the century the ground floor was projected forward to incorporate shops. As of 2011 it is in use as a restaurant and hotel called Oddfellows Chester and a part of the Oddfellows hotel group of boutique hotels. Architecture The building is constructed in brick, rendered at the front, and it has a grey slate roof. It is in three storeys and has six bays. On the street level, the third bay from the south has a projecting entrance porch. On each side of its arched doorway is a pilaster, and above the doorway is a broken pediment, over which is a frieze inscribed with ODDFELLOWS HALL. The other bays in the ground floor contain modern frontages. The first and second floor bays are linked and articulated by a colossal order formed of superposed Doric pilasters, and each bay contains a sash window. At the top of the building a cornice is supported on square brackets. The interior contains richly ornamented baroque decoration.

Geographic distribution  Wandara has 23,500 speakers in Northern Cameroon and 20,000 speakers in Nigeria. The Malgwa dialect is distinct.  Phonology  Wandala is reported to have no phonemic vowels, a rarity among the world's languages. An alternative analysis is that it has three underlying vowels a i and u and six phonetic vowels [a], [i], [u], […ô], [e] and [o]. It has a rich consonant inventory, with more than forty consonantal segments. There are two tones, with their functions differing among different morpheme classes. = Syllable structure = Some possible syllable structures are V, N (nasal consonant), CV, Glide V, VC, CVC. Consonant clusters are not permitted in the coda. To avoid breaking this constraint, a central vowel may be inserted in word-final position. The consonant r may act as a syllabic peak, meaning the structure Cr is a possible syllable structure.  Grammar  = Lexical categories = Wandala has the lexical categories of noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and predicator. = Morphology = Reduplication is a major morphological process in Wandala, with different forms and functions that may be limited to one lexical category or shared across lexical categories. Partial reduplication gives the plural form of verbs and adjectives, while complete reduplication gives aspectual and modal forms of verbs, or derives adverbs from other lexical categories. Phrases can also be reduplicated. All lexical categories can have suffixes. On verbs, suffixes have many functions, such as marking semantic and grammatical relations, directionality and point of view. Suffixes on nouns mark plural number, genitive relation and pronominal possession. Nouns can be derived by adding suffixes to numerals and adjectives. Wandala also has limited prefixes for nouns and one infix. The vowel a acts as an infix in the verbal system to encode verb plurality. = Syntax = In the noun phrase, the head precedes modifiers, determiners and quantifiers. The grammatical relations subject and object are distinguished, with distinct pronouns. However, lexical properties of verbs determine how the grammatical roles of nominal arguments are coded, with some verbs taking the controller as the unmarked argument, and others the affected entity. A nominal object or nominal subject can occur after the verb, but cannot both occupy this position, so if they co-occur, one must be fronted. This encodes information structure such as topicalization, focus or switch-reference.

David Soll was married for 30 years to Michele Morice and has three children, Jacob Soll, Samantha Soll and Benjamin Soll. Career From 1965 to 1970, he worked on the germination of Blastoclandiella emersonii under the mentorship of David Sonneborn and discovered that complex differentiations can be preprogrammed and occur without RNA or protein synthesis. From 1972 to 1978, he and colleagues worked on the \\"accumulation and erasure of morphogenetics information\\" in Dictyostelium discoideum. In 1979, he formulated the first model and conditional methods to analyze timer pathways in developing systems. From 1977 to 1984, he developed pH-regulated dimorphism and applied it to study the regulation of the bud-hypha transition in Candida albicans In 1985 and 1987, he and colleagues discovered the first high frequency switching system in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Next to this phenotypic, morphological switching system he and his co-workers also discovered the epigenetic, phenotypic white to opaque switching system. In 1989, he and Dr. E Voss finished and licensed the Dynamic Motion Analyses System (DMS), to Motion Analyses Corporation of Santa Rosa, CA. In 1997, Soll and Voss obtained the patent for DIAS, the next generation of DMS. In 1992 Soll founded the company Solltech, Inc., a computer software and hardware development company to develop and distribute DIAS. From 1987 to 1995, he and co-workers developed the first DNA fingerprinting probes for studying the population structure of infection fungi, and in 1995 received a patent for the software DENDRON, which analyzed DNA fingerprints. In 1995, Soll formed the company Caviforce Technologies to develop a method of using ultrasound for seed germination. From 1995 to 2004, he and colleagues developed the first 3D Dynamic Image Analysis System (3D-DIAS) for cells and embryos, describing how embryos form and amoeboid cells crawl. Ultrasound Solutions Inc., was formed in 1999 to develop the technology to use ultrasound in waste management.http://www.news- releases.uiowa.edu/2000/may/0526swineodor.htmlhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/05/000531072419.html In 2003 Soll founded the company Solltechnologies Inc., to sell DIAS and Dendron software. From 2005 to present, he and colleagues discovered that Candida albicans forms a \\"pathogenic\\" biofilm and a \\"sexual\\" biofilm, depending on the configuration of the mating type locus and identified the alternative pathways regulating each biofilm. From 2011 to present, he and colleagues developed a 4D model for reconstructing and motion analysing cancer tumors, the formation of cancer tumors in 3D, and the software to reconstruct and motion analyze the 3D tumors.

The property originally extended south to Q Street, but the other houses were divided from the property. History In 1792-1794 Samuel Davidson bought a portion of the 795-acre tract called the \\"Rock of Dumbarton\\" from Thomas Beall. Davidson was one of the owners of the land on which the White House and the National Mall are currently located. The house was built in 1801 at a cost of $2,302.82 with proceeds from the sale of the White House land to the Federal government of the United States. It was designed by British architect Nicholas King, the first surveyor of Washington, D.C. and founder of its first library. The house underwent interior renovations until 1818. Davidson was not married and had no children and upon his death, his nephew, Lewis Grant, inherited the property. Lewis Grant's daughter married Charles Dodge. In 1877, the Dodges sold the property to John D. McPherson. McPherson added a porch and converted the house to the Victorian architecture style. Henry Hayes Lockwood lived at the property and died there in 1899. In 1919, developer Francis H. Duehey bought the property and planned to demolish the house and build a hotel on the site. The citizens of Georgetown rallied to pass an ordinance forbidding construction taller than 40 feet. Diplomat F. Lammot Belin and his wife bought the property in 1924. Belin came from a family of French immigrants who married into the du Pont family and made a fortune in the gunpowder industry. As part of extensive renovations and enlargements, he removed Victorian elements at the house to restore its Georgian simplicity. He owned the property until his death in 1961, when it was inherited by his son, Peter Belin. In 1961, Peter added the brick orangery on the east front. In 1973, Evermay was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1996, the house was inherited by Peter's son, Harry Belin. In 1999, Harry formed the Evermay Society and began renting the estate for corporate events, weddings, anniversary parties, even fundraisers for President George W. Bush, all for tens of thousands of dollars apiece. He also let nonprofits such as Bible study groups, local preservation groups, human rights advocates and environmentalists use Evermay for free.

An Ethnologue survey in 1999 identified about 30,000 speakers of P√©v√© in the Republic of Chad and 6,000 speakers in the North and Far North regions of Cameroon (www.ethnologue.com). Like most speakers of Chadic languages, P√©v√© speakers tend to be fluent in their language of heritage as well as well as the vehicular languages of their respective areas. These include the Mundang and Fula languages, both of which are members of the Niger-Congo language family, as well as French, English, and other languages. Unlike many neighboring languages, the number of speakers of P√©v√© appears to have increased over the past two decades. This is in part due to the Comit√© pour le Promotion de la Langue et de la Culture Lam√© (CPLCL), an organization based in Cameroon and Chad whose goal is to share and preserve cultural customs and traditions, including language use. Like other Chadic languages, P√©v√© has a rich set of grammatical forms and functions that differ from those of closely related languages, even though the related languages may be spoken just a few kilometers away. For example, P√©v√© differs from many Chadic languages in having a copula corresponding to ‚Äòto be‚Äô. Unlike most languages with an inherent copula, the copula in P√©v√© can be used in reference to past or future time but not in reference to present time. Another interesting feature of P√©v√© is the use of pronouns to mark tense, mood, and aspect, along with the grammatical functions of subject and object. These and other unusual form-function relationships make P√©v√© a likely source for future linguistic studies. One unusual feature of Peve is that it contrasts voiceless and voiced glottal fricatives ( vs. ). Publications concerning P√©v√© The grammatical and semantic forms and functions of P√©v√©, along with many cultural features, are described in detail in A Grammar of P√©v√© (see below), published in January 2020 by Brill Publishers (Wikipedia Link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_Publishers). The volume, based on data gathered from 2012 to present, is written by Erin Shay, professor of Linguistics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in collaboration with Lazare Wambadang, a native speaker of P√©v√©, professional educator and president of Comit√© pour le Promotion de la Langue et de la Culture Lam√©.

The siege lasted three years from May 2011 to May 2014, and resulted in an opposition withdrawal from the city. Nationwide anti-government protests began in March 2011, and clashes between security forces and protestors in Homs intensified in April. In early May 2011, the Syrian military conducted a crackdown against anti-government protesters in Homs, some of whom were armed and fired on security forces. While the Syrian government had succeeded to temporarily quell the March‚ÄìApril Daraa protests with a large scale military operation, this early May military operation in Homs failed to succeed likewise. By September, sectarian clashes and bloodshed in Homs between Alawites and Sunnis played a larger role in Homs than in the rest of Syria. In late October 2011, a Free Syrian Army brigade built around defected army officers repeatedly ambushed government's security forces around the Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs and through early November successfully defended the Baba Amr neighborhood. In late December 2011, an Arab mission was sent to monitor the situation following the Arab League plan.The Independent, 'Arab league observers arrive in Syria to monitor crackdown', 27 December 2011 Following the abortive mission, the Syrian Army in February 2012 launched an offensive against Baba Amr, shelling the entire district and blocking all supply routes. In early March, government forces launched a ground assault into Baba Amr, forcing the rebels to withdraw from the neighborhood. By early May 2012, following a UN brokered cease-fire, only sporadic street fighting and shelling occurred. During this time, the government was in control of most of the city. The opposition held between 15% and 20% of Homs while fighting for control of a similar-sized area was still ongoing. In December 2012, the Syrian Army captured the district of Deir Baalba, leaving only the Old City, Khalidiya district, and a few other areas under rebel control. In early March 2013, government forces launched an assault into several rebel-controlled neighborhoods, but the rebels, reinforced by units that arrived from the nearby rebel-controlled town of al-Qusayr, managed to repel the attacks. In mid-March, rebels attempted to retake Baba Amr, but were forced to pull back later in the month. In March and early April 2013, the Lebanese Hezbollah militia moved fully into the Homs' fighting, in assistance to the Syrian government forces. In late July, government forces captured the Khalidiya district. In early May 2014, following an agreement reached between the government and the rebels, rebel forces were allowed to evacuate the city, leaving Homs under full government control.  Background  On 15 March 2011, a protest movement against the Syrian government began to escalate, as simultaneous demonstrations took place in major cities across Syria. Major issues included government corruption and repression. The protests spread to Homs on 18 March, after online calls for a \\"Friday of Dignity\\" (). Thousands of protesters took to the streets after Friday prayers. Attempting to disperse the crowds, police conducted many arrests and assaulted protesters. As protests continued into April, security forces fired on demonstrators, resulting in dozens of deaths. Homs became one of the most restive cities in Syria, with some activists labeling it the \\"Capital of the Revolution\\". The siege = May 2011 protests = On 6 May, following the successful operation against protestors in Daraa, the Syrian military confronted and clashed with protesters, after Friday prayers, in Homs. During the fighting 15 protesters were killed, according to the opposition, while the government stated that 11 soldiers and policemen were killed, including five at one checkpoint, after they were attacked by unknown gunmen. On 8 May, following the deadly clashes two days before, tanks rolled into several districts of Homs and started a manhunt for all known opposition activists and supporters. The night before the start of the operation, the military cut electricity to the city. During the assault, Army units entered the districts of Baba Amr and Bab Sebaa. On 8 May, unidentified gunmen attacked a bus, carrying workers who were returning from work in Lebanon to Homs, killing 10 people and wounding three. By 10 May, total control was established over the city by the military. However, the next morning, tank and machine gun fire was heard in the Bab Amr district of Homs and some nearby villages. Five to nine people were reported to have been killed in the clashes. On 11 May, Bedouin villages in the area of Homs were also targeted by the military operation. On 12 May, it was reported that security forces arrested a veteran human rights campaigner, Naji Tayara. On 20 May, anti-Assad protests were met with machine gun fire from security forces leaving 11 people dead. One week later, on 27 May, another protest was attempted by the opposition. This was again suppressed by the military in clashes that left 3 people dead. On 30 May, seven protestors and one member of the security forces were killed in clashes in Homs. = July‚ÄìOctober 2011 = On 17 July 2011, tanks and troops of Syrian security forces took up position in Dawar Al Khalidya in Homs and killed at least 30 people. The operation was apparently prompted after three government supporters were kidnapped a week prior and killed, with their dismembered bodies being returned to their relatives on 17 July. , sectarian bloodshed, such as assassinations on academics without clear ties to protestors nor to government, played a larger role in Homs than in the rest of Syria. (page 17) All through September and October there were reported clashes in the northern section of the city, especially the neighborhood of Dayr Baalba. There was also occasional violence in Bab al-Sebaa, Baba Amr and other places. In late September, fighting in the nearby town of Rastan forced several rebel groups to flee to Homs. In late October 2011, the Khalid bin Walid Brigade of the Free Syrian Army, built around defected Syrian army officers, having fled from the nearby town of Rastan to the Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs, repeatedly ambushed government's security forces around this neighborhood, (page 13) and through early November effectively defended the Baba Amr neighborhood. (pages 17+19) On the night of 28 October, fierce clashes involving the Free Syrian Army broke out in Bab al- Sebaa. The next day, these clashes spread to Baba Amr and al-Qusur. During the street fighting in Bab al-Sebaa district, 17 soldiers were killed, while in Baba Amr 20 soldiers were killed and 53 wounded. = November 2011 operation = The early November government's clearance operation in Homs was a response against the armed resistance in the Homs area. On 3 November 2011, tanks opened fire on the Baba Amr district, where the soldiers were killed several days before. More than 100 people, including civilians, were reportedly killed by the next day. It was reported that several tanks were destroyed by the Free Syrian Army. On 8 November, it was reported that the Syrian Army took firm control of the Bab Amr quarter in Homs and that the armed defectors went into hiding. On 24 November 2011, defecting soldiers were killed and four wounded during clashes on the western outskirts of Homs. Later, the military conducted raids against farms further to the west killing another 15 people. = Escalation of the fighting and rebels gaining ground (November and December) = On 25 November 2011, six elite pilots, one technical officer and three other personnel were killed in Homs in an ambush. The Syrian government vowed to \\"cut every evil hand\\" of the attackers as a result. The Free Syrian army claimed responsibility for the attack on the air base staff. In early December a Sky News correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, was able to smuggle himself and his crew, with help of defectors from the FSA, into Homs where he reported heavy fighting each day despite the heavy presence of Syrian army checkpoints. Moreover, the Free Syrian Army was able to build up checkpoints in the city as well aimed at protection of civilians during demonstrations in suburbs and city alleys after the central square became too dangerous. Video surfaced that purportedly showed defectors in control of Bab Amr again, with a checkpoint at the entrance to check for \\"Shabiha infiltrators\\". According to his account, Homs was clearly a war zone which had already slipped into full-scale civil war. On 4 December, heavy fighting raged during which at least five FSA insurgents were killed and one wounded. Around 5 December 61 people were reported to be dead, 34 Sunnis and 27 Alawites. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said an activist on the ground reported seeing \\"the bodies of 34 civilians, in a square in the pro-regime neighbourhood of Al-Zahra, who had been abducted by the shabiha [pro-government militia] on Monday\\", according to the AFP news agency. The civilians, the group said, had been seized from several \\"anti-regime neighbourhoods\\" in Homs, probably meaning Bab Amr. The Observatory also reported the \\"shabiha\\" abducted a bus driver and his 13 passengers in Homs province on the 5th. Both sides blamed each other for the killings, but both the pro- and anti-government forces stated that each side had enough motive for the killings of the Sunnis and the Alawites, showing the beginning of possible sectarian violence in the conflict. On 8 December, a pipeline carrying oil from the east of the country to a refinery in Homs was blown up, an activist group said. \\"This is the main pipeline that feeds the Homs refinery,\\" said Rami Abdulrahman of the British- based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The group said flames could be seen at the site of the explosion. Video footage on the Internet of the purported blast site showed black clouds of smoke rising above a built-up area. One military tank was destroyed and seen burning on a city street. On 9 December, fears of a massacre by government forces were building, due to a build up of troops, government militia (Shabeeha) and 500 tanks on the outskirts of the city and an increasing number of checkpoints. On 18 December, fierce fighting between regular army units and defectors near the town of al-Qusair in Homs, six soldiers were killed in the clashes, including an officer. According to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, \\"Three armoured vehicles were destroyed and those inside were wounded and killed,\\" a civilian was also apparently killed in the violence. In mid-December Der Spiegel crew managed to smuggle themselves inside the city of Homs where they witnessed the Baba Amr district being completely under control of FSA fighters with checkpoints erected at the edge of the district. According to local FSA commander Shabeeha and army snipers were positioned in approximately 200 places in Homs and were shooting on everything that moved in designated zones like Cairo street which runs through the center of the city. Although FSA defectors did not have power to stand against the all-out assault on Baba Amr by Syrian Army they revealed that they plan to withdraw from district and wait for main bulk of Syrian army forces to withdraw from district as they did in October. On 24 December, thousands of troops poured into the city and around 4,000 soldiers surrounded the Baba Amr district, digging trenches. The military started an attack on five neighbourhoods and heavy shelling was reported deep into the night. The military continued their shelling until 26 December, killing 33‚Äì34 people on the third day of the bombardment. By the end of 2011, the Khalid bin Walid Brigade of the Free Syrian Army controlled the Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs. = Arab League mission and decrease in fighting = In early December 2011, the Syrian government accepted an Arab League plan to send observers to monitor the situation on the ground and agreed to withdraw army equipments from cities. On 27 December, activists told al arabiya that at least 61 civilians had died in the shelling of Homs in recent days but reported withdrawal of Syrian army tanks and halt of ongoing military operations by Syrian army in the city. Some 70,000 protesters gathered in central Homs during the official visit of Arab League observer mission and were later dispersed by tear gas. The head of the Syrian National Council (SNC) Burhan Ghalioun said that the Syrian government will not permit the Arab observers in Homs to tour the streets or to visit Baba Amr neighborhood.30,000 70,000 Syrians rally as Arab monitors visit Homs; tanks seen leaving flashpoint city On 28 December, the head of the Arab League observers said that the situation was calm in Homs and that there were no clashes. He said that they saw some armored vehicles but no tanks. Overall he judged the situation \\"reassuring so far\\". He said \\"there were some places where the situation was not good\\", and called for further inquiry. However, one of the monitors spoke to Al Jazeera from Syria on the condition of anonymity said the situation in Homs is \\"very dangerous\\" and that it is under constant shelling, and many videos posted online by activists seems to show the orange vested monitors under fire in Homs. He said that some areas are under the control of the Free Syrian Army, army defectors. Human Rights Watch later accused Syria's government of hiding hundreds of prisoners held in its crackdown from Arab observers visiting the country, saying Syrian authorities have transferred perhaps hundreds of detainees to off-limits military sites to hide them from Arab League monitors in the country. Human Rights Watch interviewed a Syrian security officer in Homs, who said that he received orders from his prison director to assist with irregular detainee transfers. He said the orders came after President Bashar al-Assad's government. \\"He estimated that on 21 and 22 December approximately 400 to 600 detainees were moved out of his detention facility to other places of detention.\\" \\"The transfers happened in installments,\\" the unidentified official was quoted as saying. \\"Some detainees were moved in civilian jeeps and some in cargo trucks. My role was inside the prison, gathering the detainees and putting them in the cars. My orders from the prison director were to move the important detainees out,\\" he said. He said they were being taken to a military missile factory in Zaidal, just outside Homs. Human Rights Watch said his account was corroborated by other witnesses, including a detainee who said that among 150 people being held at one site were people who worked with journalists, defectors, and protesters. Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW's Middle East director, said the security officer also told HRW that the Syrian government was issuing police identification cards to its military officials, which the rights watchdog said was in violation of the Arab League accord. \\"Dressing soldiers in police uniforms does not meet the Arab League call to withdraw the army,\\" said Whitson.\\"The Arab League needs to cut through Syrian government deception by pushing for full access to anywhere Syria is holding detainees.\\" Activists and human rights groups have strongly criticized the head of the Arab League monitors, Omar Idilbi of the Local Coordination Committees, described Dabi as a \\"senior officer with an oppressive regime that is known to repress opposition\\", adding that there are fears he might not be neutral. Haytham Manna, a prominent Paris-based dissident, urged the Arab League to replace Dabi or reduce his authority. \\"We know his history and his shallow experience in the area,\\" he said. Amnesty International also criticized Dabi, saying that he led Bashir's military intelligence service until August 1995, when he was appointed head of external security in Sudan. \\"During the early 1990s, the military intelligence in Sudan was responsible for the arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearance, and torture or other ill-treatment of numerous people in Sudan,\\" it said in a statement. \\"The Arab League's decision to appoint as the head of the observer mission a Sudanese general on whose watch severe human rights violations were committed in Sudan risks undermining the League's efforts so far and seriously calls into question the mission's credibility,\\" Amnesty said. \\"He won't be neutral, and would sympathise with those in similar positions, thus it won't be surprising if he supports and sympathises with the Syrian regime and its henchmen who are committing crimes against humanity round the clock in Syria,\\" the head of the Syrian League, Abd-al-Karim al-Rayhawi, told the BBC. General Dabi is wanted by the ICC as they have linked him to genocide against opposition in Darfur. = January 2012 fighting and clashes = Situation in Homs, mid-January 2012 The exiled spokesman of the armed rebels regrouped under the Free Syrian Army. In early January 2012 they called the Arab League mission a failure and stated that they did not want them to stay in Syria even though the Syrian Army withdrew its heavy weapons from the city. The mission was finally ended at the end of the month. On 4 January, Basil al-Sayed, who regularly filmed security forces cracking down on anti-government protesters in his neighbourhood of Bab Amr in Homs, died in a local hospital of gunshot wounds on 27 December, according to news reports. He was reportedly shot by security forces. His footage appeared on the sites of loose-knit citizen news organisations. The Committee to Protect Journalists says it is investigating the circumstances surrounding the death. On 11 January, A France 2 journalist Gilles Jacquier, who covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Algeria among others, was among several people killed in Syria's central city of Homs, becoming the first Western reporter to have died in the unrest in the country. A witness in Homs, who asked not to be named, said the casualties were caused by rocket-propelled grenades fired during a pro-Assad rally, while according to a journalist who was quoted by CNN Nic Robertson, with Jacquier in Homs, said that the attack was carried out by mortar. Rami Abdul Rahman, of the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, quoted activists in Homs as saying the journalists had been near the Akrama neighbourhood of Homs at the time. State TV SANA later claimed a colonel was captured by an \\"armed terrorist group\\" in Homs. A BBC journalist told Le Figaro that the journalist was killed when a rocket targeted a pro-Assad rally in an Alawi quarter of Homs, although another journalist said that Jacquier had been travelling in a vehicle with other journalists that had been hit by an RPG. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, and Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, condemned the killing and called on Syrian authorities to shed \\"full light\\" on the circumstances of his death. Meanwhile, The SNC denounced the \\"murder\\" of Jacquier, saying it was a \\"dangerous sign that the authorities have decided to physically liquidate journalists in an attempt to silence neutral and independent media.\\" Anti-government activists in Homs also said the authorities had orchestrated the attack, and Wissam Tarif, an Arab campaigner with international activist non-governmental organization Avaaz, undermined the government's claims. \\"The journalists were attacked in a heavily militarized regime stronghold. It would be hugely difficult for any armed opposition to penetrate the area and launch such a deadly attack,\\" he said. Tarif also said the incident was an \\"unacceptable breach of the Arab League protocol\\", to which Syria has committed itself and which requires journalists to have freedom to report across Syria. \\"The regime has denied journalists free access to the country, forcing them to join press tours organized by the ministry of information and chaperoned closely by regime minders,\\" he said. However, Arab League mission reports from Homs indicate that Gilles Jacquier was killed by mortar shells fired by opposition forces.League of Arab States Observer Mission to Syria: Report of the Head of the League of Arab States Observer Mission to Syria for the period from 24 December 2011 to 18 January 2012. Point 44, page 6. On 22 January, two Swiss journalists blamed Syrian authorities for the death of their French colleague killed in Homs. Patrick Vallelian and Sid Ahmed Hammouche told the Associated Press that they believe the attack was part of an elaborate trap set up by Syrian authorities. The two Swiss reporters and Jacquier were part of a group of foreign journalists being escorted through Homs by Syrian soldiers and intelligence officials. Vallelian, of the weekly L'Hebdo, and Hammouche, of the daily La Liberte, newspapers said the soldiers appeared to know in advance that the attack was going to happen. On 23 January, a military officer at the main city hospital claimed to foreign journalists that rebels have taken control over two-thirds of the city with army casualties being at 4 to 5 dead and 10 to 50 wounded soldiers and security officials per day. This claim was backed up by the opposition forces stating that they had indeed managed to wrestle control of over half the city. Residents of Homs also largely corroborate these reports. Protest in the Bab Dreeb district of Homs On 24 January, the LCC reported that at least 18 people were killed when the army shelled two buildings in the district of Bab Tadmor in Homs. A resident said \\"The buildings were six-story buildings. Many families remain missing. It is hard to confirm the exact number of those killed. A video posted on the internet shows two destroyed buildings, reduced to rubble said to have been the two attacked buildings.\\" On 27 January a brutal attack took place against Sunni Muslims in Homs killing at least 30 people. Firstly, the Syrian government fired heavy mortar rounds on the Karm al-Zeitoun neighborhood of Homs, killing at least 16 people. Then Pro-assad militia called \\"shabiba\\" entered a building in the neighbourhood, and killed 14 members of a Sunni family. The Bahader family was found shot and hacked to death, the dead included 8 children under the age of 9. YouTube video footage was taken by activists, showing the family members dead bodies, with wounds to the head and neck including children. There was no comment from the Syrian authorities, but a doctor in Homs said \\"Alawites who had remained in Karm al-Zeitoun mysteriously left four days ago, and the rumor was that they did so on orders by the authorities. Today we know why. We also have seventy people wounded. Field hospitals themselves are coming under mortar fire.\\" Activists reported that the Syrian army killed eight civilians and that 15 government soldiers were killed by defectors while the Syrian army entered the Al-Adawiya district, driving out the FSA rebels. The Syrian Al-Watan newspaper reported that 37 rebel fighters were killed in the fighting in Homs. Video footage was posted online reportedly showing a captured government BMP-1, being used in Homs by the FSA's forces. It bears two flags of the Syrian opposition, and is seen firing with armed men in civilian clothes backing it up, and taking cover behind it. The Free Syrian Army assaulted on, 1 February, the government- controlled district of Bab Drib, which was used as a staging post for Syrian army raids and shelling of other districts such as Karm Al Zeitoun. France 24 journalist saw on the ground at least four FSA vehicles making their way to the frontline. Video obtained by France 24 later showed the FSA overrunning the former military base in Bab Drib district. At least four government soldiers were killed in the assault. The next day, it appeared that another military checkpoint fell to the FSA. = February 2012 army offensive = Attack 300px Following the killing of 10 Syrian Army soldiers at a checkpoint and the capture of 19 by the Free Syrian Army, during the night hours of 3 February 2012 and into the early hours of the following day, on the 30th anniversary of the Hama massacre, government forces began an artillery bombardment of Homs, particularly the Khaldiyeh neighborhood, with opposition activists claiming that it led to over 200 deaths. According to the opposition activist group SOHR, after more than two hours oov, his colleague Peter Beaumont and Syrian self-described 'citizen journalist' Omar Shakir all tweeting that the Syrian Army had not entered the district. 300px The opposition Syrian National Council claimed the death toll was at 416 residents of the city. They also cited residents as saying at least 36 houses were completely destroyed with families still inside. According to an Al Arabiya correspondent in Homs, the district hospital was also destroyed. The correspondent claimed that at least 337 people had been killed and over 1,600 people were injured in the shelling. However, the SNC and Al Arabiya figures were not independently confirmed and several international media outlets including Reuters, France 24, BBC and CNN still reported the toll of around 200. The FSA vowed to fight back with intense operations against the governments' forces and claimed to have destroyed an air intelligence building in Homs. Opposition activists posted many videos of burning buildings and dead bodies that they claimed occurred in Homs. Some footage showed buildings reduced to rubble from shelling. At least 30 buildings, including a hospital, were destroyed or severely damaged in the shelling. According to SOHR, in addition to the civilian deaths, 14 soldiers and five army defectors were also killed in the shelling and fighting. The Local Coordination Committees also initially claimed that the death toll was more than 200 people, saying that they were working to confirm the number of deaths. They later revised their figures with a confirmation of 55 deaths. On 5 February, the LCC stated that 181 people had been killed in Homs. On 6 February, there were reports of new shelling in Bab Amr, an opposition quarter of Homs. A death toll of 12 people killed was given by activists. Other activists gave a different death toll of 50. Residents called as witnesses said that 150 armored vehicles were on the outskirts of the quarters On 8 February activists reported an unverified death toll of 48 people killed. They also reported that tanks entered the Inshaat neighborhood. In Bayyada quarter of Homs, a bomb placed in a car killed several people, with civilians and security forces being among the casualties. On 9 February, activists said 93 people were killed in Homs by artillery shelling. Another group of activist gave a lower death toll of 57 dead. On 10 February an FSA spokesman reported that Ahmed Jumrek, an FSA colonel, died in the shelling along with four other rebel fighters. Activists stated that tanks of governments forces were stationed in the Inshaat quarter, firing on Bab Amr from a bridge. They also reported that soldiers were damaging stores and cars while conducting a house-to-house sweep. On 11 February activists reported that Syrian Army tanks started moving from the Inshaat quarter to the edge of the Bab Al Amr district. An FSA fighter told British journalist Paul Wood, that they summary executed 11 prisoners of war under the pretext that they were Shabiha, following an ambush of armored vehicles in December, during which eight other soldiers were also killed. He also showed him video which he claimed was from one of the Shabiha cellphones showing beheading of opposition prisoners. On 14 February an FSA commander told reporters that his men had repelled a ground assault on Bab amr district, saying that four government tanks had been destroyed when they tried to enter, although his claims could not be verified. On 22 February 2012, American journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer R√©mi Ochlik were killed when a rocket hit their safe house. The day before her death one of them, Colvin, had spoken to CNN and others of the \\"absolutely sickening\\", indiscriminate attacks on civilians as the government pursued its objectives. Another photographer, Paul Conroy, and French journalist Edith Bouvier (Le Figaro) were also injured during the attack. Nicolas Sarkozy described the killing as assassination. It is believed possible the journalists were targeted. The editor of The Sunday Times also said he believed his reporter had been targeted. Seven civilian activists were found executed by the Syrian government because they had been collaborating with the Avaaz action group. The group had been delivering medical aid to Homs. Two others, including a foreigner, remained missing. The foreigner was a paramedic with the group when Avaaz did not reveal his name or nationality, but alerted the country's embassy. \\"They carried a respirator and medicines,\\" An Avaaz activist said. After losing contact with them, a member of the network on Wednesday \\"found seven of them shot dead, with hands tied behind their backs... just before the entrance to Baba Amr,\\" the activist told AFP. \\"Those were civilian activists, unpaid volunteers,\\" he said, accusing the \\"Shabiha armed forces\\" of killing the men whose ages ranged between 16 and 24. On 27 February 2012, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 68 bodies were found between the villages of Ram al-Enz and Ghajariyeh and were taken to the central hospital of Homs. The wounds showed that some of the dead were shot while others were killed by cutting weapons. The Local Coordination Committees, another opposition group, reported that 64 dead bodies were found, all adult men. These two sources hypothesized that the victims were civilians who tried to flee the battle in Homs and were then killed by a pro-government militia. However, other activists reported another version of the killings, saying that the victims were Alawites, from the same sect as the president. The bodies were recovered in pro-government areas. An injured British photo- journalist, Paul Conroy, was successfully smuggled into Lebanon by Syrian rebels from the Farouk Brigade of the Free Syrian Army and volunteers who were local Baba Amr activists ( from city of Homs, Syria). It is claimed by Avaaz that this rescue attempt cost the life of between 13 to 23 volunteers, out of the 35 that the Avaaz group sent. This claim is disputed by Paul Conroy in the book Under the Wire. Paul states that activist group Avaaz charged $3000 to reporters Remi Ochlik and Edith Bouvier to enter Baba Amr a week earlier (in the city of Homs), using the same route and tunnel that he used to escape. The death toll was later stated as 23 deaths of the 50 (people), by Ricken Patel, of the activist group Avaaz.  Fall of Baba Amr  Burning building in Homs after Syrian Army bombardment. On 28 February 2012, reinforcements from an elite Syrian military unit, directed by the brother of the Syrian president, took positions in Homs. They managed to completely seal off the city, notably by destroying a tunnel. On the morning of 29 February, an activist claimed that the Syrian Army had launched a ground assault with infantry on the rebel-held district of Baba Amr. A Syrian official who spoke on condition of anonymity appeared to confirm that the security forces were advancing on this district, were \\"cleaning\\" it from rebel fighters, and that the operation would be over in a matter of hours. However, as more reports started to emerge in the late afternoon, it seemed that a ground invasion had not taken place after all, with The Guardian Middle East correspondent Martin Chulov, his colleague Peter Beaumont and Syrian self-described 'citizen journalist' Omar Shakir all tweeting that the Syrian Army had not entered the district. Heavy shelling reportedly continued, meanwhile. Although the FSA Farouq Brigades defending Baba Amr stated that they would fight to the last man, it was reported that some of the FSA leaders already made an escape from the district. On the morning of 1 March, the situation was very confused due to a total information blackout from Baba Amr. Two opposition groups said that the Syrian Army did not take the quarter, while according to another the army took a portion of the quarter, Avaaz group reported. The Revolutionary Council of Homs said that they had no news on the situation in Baba Amr. Later in the day, the Syrian Army took full control of the quarter of Baba Amr according to a Syrian official. Rebel leaders reported that they pulled out of the quarter and that some fighters stayed to cover the retreat. During their retreat, 17 rebels were captured by the military and executed on the spot. The activist group Avaaz, for its part, claimed they were civilians and that they were beheaded, but this was not confirmed by other sources. Aid groups said they had received the green light from the army to deliver the needed supplies and treatments though government soldiers then held them up, amid suspicions this was to cover up crimes they were in process of committing. ICRC then reported it had been denied access to Baba Amr, calling it 'unacceptable'.BBC Five Live News, 2 March 2011 The UN High Commission for Human Rights (UNHCR) said it had received reports of executions in Homs. At a later date, an FSA commander stated that out of 250 rebel fighters defending the district 114 were killed in the fighting. The conquest of the quarter of Baba Amr by the Syrian Army provoked multiple reactions from analysts and officials. An analyst close to the Syrian government named Taleb Ibrahim commented that it was the beginning of the victory, commenting that the army had broken the back of the armed opposition. Free Syrian Army commander Riad al-Asaad vowed to continue to fight until the fall of the government and said that his troops had to leave because of the poor conditions of the civilians. A Lebanese official said that the Syrian Army wanted to retake Homs at all costs and noted that such an outcome would leave the opposition without a stronghold. Ayham Kamel, a Middle East analyst, analyzed that the Syrian Army used Baba Amr to send the message that it was still the dominant force on the battleground. He noted in addition that Baba Amr was a significant base for the organization and weapons supplies of the opposition. The first March the opposition was able to smuggle French journalists, the last who remained in the city, Edith Bouvier and William Daniels, into Lebanon in an operation which cost the life of 6 Free Syrian Army members. British journalist Paul Conroy, who escaped the city a few days ago, described the situation as an \\"indiscriminate massacre\\" and \\"slaughter\\" and compared Homs to the Battle of Grozny. Fleeing residents gave reports to a BBC journalist of atrocities in Homs. Fleeing refugees said that Government loyalists had rounded up 36 men and boys in the district and killed them. Witnesses said that the loyalists had been cutting the throats of prisoners. This is while men from an elite army division defected and said that they defected because they had received orders to shoot everything, military and civilian alike and one said he witnessed his commander executing an old man. On 5 March 2012, Channel 4 News showed film from the military hospital in Homs showing evidence of covert abuse, of injured civilians being subjected to torture - electrocutions, leg breaking, beatings with whips and electrical cable, shackled to beds, penises tied to prevent urination, gangrene left untreated by antibiotics. Residents of Bab Amr were very angry about the Free Syrian Army decision to withdraw, and one of them said that rebels were cowards to leave, and added that if they were to withdraw, they should have done it the first day and not after one month of siege. The rebels pulled back again, leaving in a hurry a village just outside Homs. The Syrian newspaper Al-Watan reported that bodies of foreigners were found, including the body of a European, who allegedly carried the passport of the journalist Espinoza, and the government claimed he \\"was suspected of commanding a group of rebels\\". An FSA commander stated that five Libyans among the rebels had been killed in the fighting in Homs. UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos has said that the Syrian city of Homs had been \\"completely devastated\\" and heard gunfire there during a visit on 7 March, her spokeswoman had told the AFP news agency. Amos was also stopped from going into areas in Homs still held by the opposition after Syria's foreign minister had told her she could go to any part of the country, UN humanitarian affairs spokeswoman Amanda Pitt said. A BBC journalist, Paul Wood, returning to Homs in early March, reported that he encountered many groups of women and children, without men, who told stories of raids and of massacres and of a populace terrified of what the government forces are doing now they are back in control. = Karm al-Zeitoun massacre = On 9 March 2012, 30 tanks of the Syrian Army entered the quarter of Karm al-Zeitoun. After this, it was reported that the Syrian Army had massacred 47 women and children in the district (26 children and 21 women), some of whom had their throats slit, according to activists. The opposition claimed that the main perpetrators behind the killings were the government paramilitary force the Shabiha. The Syrian National Council (SNC), the main opposition group, called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to discuss the \\"massacre\\", which it said took place on 11 March. Hadi Abdallah, a Syrian activist, said: \\"Some of the children had been hit with blunt objects on their head, one little girl was mutilated and some women were raped before being killed,\\" he said. Video footage was made of the bodies. The Syrian government acknowledged that the massacre had indeed taken place, but claimed as usual that \\"armed gangs\\" in the district killed them. On 13 March, opposition activists posted a video on the internet purporting to show the army shelling the district of Karm al- Zeitoun. = March 2012 shelling and fighting = Situation in Homs, mid-March 2012 On 20 March 2012, 14 were reported killed from a new round of shelling, which continued into the next day, hitting the opposition stronghold neighborhoods of Khalidiya, Qussor, and Bayada in northern Homs. The military also reportedly entered Khalidiya. The opposition activist group, the L.C.C., stated that another 40 people were killed on the second day of the bombardment, including 25 in Khalidiya. On 24 March, most rebel forces retreated from the Bab Sbaa district, under intense shelling, as the military moved in and a number of civilians were also attempting to leave the neighborhood. However, activists reported the neighbourhood was still under bombardment of heavy shelling as of 26 March. Still, an activist stated that the FSA presence in the district was small and they were not in a position to do anything. Another activist also later confirmed the capture of the district. On 2 April, about 40 FSA members captured the National Hospital in Juret al-Shayah district. They found 78 corpses \\"stacked in a hospital refrigerator\\". In renewed fighting on 8 April, mortars were described as falling \\"like rain\\" on the opposition-held neighbourhood of Khaldiyeh, according to an activist. A makeshift hospital was allegedly stacked with 40 bodies which the opposition were desperately trying to keep cool with fans. According to the activist, they may have to be buried \\"in public gardens\\" due to a lack of other feasible options. =During the UN brokered cease-fire= On 14 April 2012, into the morning major shelling happened in the districts of Juret al-Shayah and al-Qarabis that violated the Kofi Annan truce that was implemented the same day. On 15 April, the Syrian Army was reported to be shelling the neighborhood of al-Waer from the nearby military academy. SANA also reported that terrorists killed 12 civilians in the Alawite, pro-Assad, neighborhood of al-Zahra in what seemed like an FSA attack on the neighborhood. On 16 April, heavy shelling was coming from three sides into al- Khalidiya. The government also stormed al-Bayada and took control of half of it. They were also trying to storm Juret al-Shayah and al-Qarabis, but were being repelled by the FSA. On 20 April, a rebel leader stated that 2,000 rebels fighters of the Farouq Brigades had been killed in Homs province since August 2011. By this point, there were talks among the rebels in Qusayr, where most of the surviving Baba Amr rebels fled, of Homs being abandoned entirely. Sky News correspondent, Tim Marshall, was in the rebel-held al-Khalidiya district. Marshall claimed that the FSA still controlled large areas of the city. Hundreds of civilians still lived in Khalidiya, despite heavy shelling. The Homs National Hospital in Juret al-Shayah district, captured by the FSA weeks before, had been reportedly badly damaged by government artillery shelling. Marshall's report, on 1 May, stated that Army snipers were still active in the city. In many streets, sheets of tarpaulin hang from one side to the other and concrete walls had been put up to prevent the snipers from having a clear line of sight into Khalidiya. In some smaller streets, which the snipers can see clearly, people had to break into a sprint to cross. The Homs FSA commander, Abdul Razzack Tlas, pointed to the sniper activity as a violation of the UN ceasefire, even though the UN said that neither side is completely abiding by the ceasefire. By late April, UN military observers noted a rare lull in the fighting in Homs and by early May, military offensive operations in the city had ceased although sporadic street fighting and shelling continued. The government controlled most of the city, however, the opposition still held onto 15 to 20 percent of the city, with a similar area still being contested. In May, the Armenian Church reported that the Armenian Apostolic Church in the Hamida district of Homs had been seized by opposition forces, who then set up a hospital inside the church's Isahakyan school.PanARMENIAN.Net, \\"Catholicos Aram I condemns Armenian church attack in Homs\\" On 24 May, a UN panel reported that, beside a number of human rights violations committed by the Syrian military, observing that \\"state security forces continued to use lethal force against anti-government demonstrations in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo, Hama, Damascus - \\" and that \\"too often civilians bore the brunt of the violence\\" - the rebel FSA was also responsible for the torture and execution of a number of captured soldiers. The sources for the panel's report included eyewitness accounts from FSA fighters who were involved in the killings. One defector belonging to the Farouq Brigades stated that they executed government soldiers after they confessed, during torture, to crimes against civilians. Among those killed were allegedly three Iranian snipers. In the Jabal al Zawiya and Deir Sinbal districts, FSA makeshift prisons were reportedly set up for captured soldiers. On 26 May, British foreign secretary William Hague said Britain would co-ordinate a \\"strong response\\" to the massacre in Houla, a town near Homs, and a U.N Security council statement, approved also by Russia and China, condemned the killings - \\" the result of government artillery and tank shellings on a civilian neighbourhood.\\" The government's alleged use of heavy weapons in civilian areas was condemned. On 29 May, a young Syrian filmmaker Bassel Shahade who had filmed Homs during the conflict and appeared on a new show talking about how the army had besieged the city was killed in Homs. On 30 May, opposition video allegedly showed the restart of shelling of the city by the military. On 6 June, a CNN report showed Cairo St. (Al-Qahira St.) being a frontline between the FSA who controlled the district of al-Kalidiya and the Syrian government who controlled the district of al-Bayada. Several of the FSA fighters were former civilians and some were army defectors. The video showed them coordinating via radio and had made holes connecting one building to the next so they would not have to use the open streets. =June 2012 army offensive= On 8 June 2012, it was reported that shelling had picked up in the FSA-held al-Kalidiyah, at a rate of 10 shells per minute. Following the shelling, the Syrian Army made an attempt to storm the district. On 9 June, the Syrian Army stormed the rebel- held neighborhood of al-Ghouta and started conducting raids. Shelling was reported in several parts of the city during which 25 people died, including the mayor of the rebel-held neighborhood of al-Khalidiyah, which had been under heavy bombardment since the day before. With the capture of al-Ghouta the Army had completely encircled the city's rebel-held areas and cut them off from the outside world. Early on 10 June, rebels captured an Air Force missile base north of Homs, with the help of 22 soldiers from the unit stationed there. They looted a number of assault rifles and rocket-propelled-grenades and threatened to fire the missiles at the presidential palace in Damascus if president al-Assad did not surrender. However, soon after, government artillery hit the base and an Army counter-attack recaptured it. The rebels were not able to take with them the large and heavy SA-2 surface-to-air missiles, which were fixed to the launchers. A satellite imagery provider showed the al-Ghanto base in flames following the artillery strikes. Opposition activists also reported a more intensified campaign of bombardment of Homs. On 12 June, residents of the rebel-held neighborhood of al-Khalidiyah told Al Jazeera English that they had been trapped in their homes for three days with no electricity or water. Other neighborhoods were targeted by shelling as well. In the district of Bab Amr, which had been retaken by the Army in early March, videos appeared showing two government tanks getting blown up at the Kafar Aya checkpoint, one of the largest in the district. Local FSA units reportedly had relaunched attacks in the neighbourhood to decrease the pressure on al-Khalidiyah and other areas which were being shelled. On 15 June, more fighting erupted with the Army reportedly shelling, among other rebel-held districts, Baba Amr. The FSA Baba Amr brigade claimed to had taken control over a checkpoint leading to the city two days before.

However, this was not independently confirmed. The same day, an activist stated that the Army stepped up its offensive on the city, shelling neighbourhoods systematically. It was reported that the Shabiha took over all the city's hospitals, thus dozens of wounded were without treatment, and that the Army had cut each of Homs's districts from each other. An opposition campaigner claimed that \\"85% of Homs is now under shelling or bombardment with mortar rounds and heavy machine guns.\\" The shelling was primarily hitting the remaining rebel-held areas in the neighborhoods of Old Homs, al-Khalidiya, Jourat al-Shayyah, Qarabis and al-Bayada. The Syrian opposition said that, at that point, 30,000 soldiers and pro-government militiamen had amassed at the city. The SNC claimed there was a \\"looming massacre\\" approaching by claiming that the government was \\"getting ready to carry out a savage attack that might massacre the city's remaining residents.\\" On 19 June, widespread clashes around Baba Amr were reportedly continuing and black smoke was seen rising from the area after an oil pipeline was said to have been destroyed in the fighting. Around 20 June, rebels launched a full-out offensive on Baba Amr district after rebels reportedly drove hundreds of soldiers from a pair of bases in the district. As a response, the military started using helicopter gunships in the city for the first time while rebel fighters were still holding out against military assaults on districts in Old Homs.Syrian rebels launch offensive to retake key Homs neighborhood By this time, the city's remaining Christians were trapped by the fighting in the rebel-held districts of Hamidiyeh and Bustan Diwan. A fourth attempt at a negotiated ceasefire, to evacuate the trapped civilians, was underway. However, the chief negotiator felt hopeless. He said that in past attempts the Army had agreed to a two-hour truce to allow the mediators to evacuate the besieged people but they were blocked by the rebels. This was confirmed by at least on Homs resident, who stated that he feared the rebels wanted to keep the Christians trapped in the city as a bargaining chip while the Army's bombardment and ground attacks on Homs intensified. Those who managed to sneak out settled in an area outside the city, dubbed as Valley of the Christians.Christians vulnerable in Syria On 28 June, SANA claimed a number of violent incidents around Homs. In one, a group of rebels reportedly opened fire and killed a professor of al-Baath University in Homs. She was killed along with her mother, father and three of her sister's children.

On 8 October, government forces advanced into the rebel-held Khalidiya district amid heavy fighting and what was described as the most vicious attack by the Army yet. The advance was confirmed by the rebels who stated they were forced to retreat due to the artillery fire destroying several buildings that were being used by the opposition fighters as a barrier between them and the military.Syrian forces advance into rebel-held part of Homs By October 2012, Hezbollah openly operated in the area of the neighbouring city of al-Qusayr, in conjunction with Syrian military forces. A military source said in October that the Army launched a broad offensive to take control of all remaining Homs quarters and the neighbouring city of Al Qusayr as well. The source expected the operation to take one week to be completed. However, Al Qusayr remained in the hands of rebels, who reported to have killed 60 Hezbollah fighters in the city. Another 16 were captured in the Sayida Zeinab and Qabboun districts of Homs, according to senior FSA members.Syria: FSA kill 60 Hezbollah fighters, retake town Asharq Alawsat Newspaper (English) A Homs resident living in a rebel-held neighbourhood said that the shelling was very heavy. He added that the Syrian army was currently controlling 75% of the city and that the rest could fall at any moment because of the strength of the Army attack. On 9 October, a resident living in rebel-controlled Hamidiya district described the Syrian army offensive as psychological warfare, saying that the Syrian army made little to no gains in Old Homs districts, being repeatedly repelled by rebel forces. This was in contrast with an opposition activist's confirmation that the army had \\"stormed part of Khaldiyeh\\" and the reported rebel retreat the previous day within the district, which was confirmed by rebel fighters. Also, the Army reported continued advances in the area, where they were reportedly pursuing rebel remnants. On 10 October, the pro-government \\"Al Watan\\" newspaper said that the Syrian army controlled all of Homs except for a few neighborhoods still being held by the rebels. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in an email that the Syrian army renewed shelling of the Khalidiya, Jouret Shiyah and Old Homs neighborhoods. Opposition activist Abu Bilal al-Homsi said via \\"Skype\\" to \\"AFP\\", from Old Holms, \\"We are surrounded completely, we have no outlet.\\" He also called on non-governmental organizations to send aid, pointing out that \\"the hospitals overwhelmed with the wounded who need surgery and should be evacuated.\\" Activists rejected Government claims about districts in the city of Homs and an FSA colonel pointed out that the Government hadn't seized control of any districts but \\"they are advancing in some districts and retreating in others.\\" he stressted that \\"al-Assad's forces are able to do nothing more than storm the entrance of a district and then immediately withdraw, despite the magnitude of the destruction they are causing.\\"Al-Assad forces - FSA contest over control of Homs Asharq Alawsat Newspaper (English) On 12 October, the Syrian military launched another series of intense aerial and artillery bombardments on Homs and its surrounding towns.

There are many dead from both the regime and the FSA.\\" He added that \\"very few civilians remain in the neighborhoods around Homs.\\" There was intense fighting in the Bab Hud and Bab al-Turkman districts with an unknown number of people on both sides being killed. By late October, a Syrian army officer in Homs estimated that 1,500-2,000 rebels were left inside the Old City district. At this time, government troops cleared the Bab al-Sebaa area by capturing a school that was being used as a rebel stronghold. =December 2012 situation= By mid-December 2012, the military had regained control of almost all of Homs, except the Old City and Khalidiya district, where rebels were still holding out under siege by the Army. The rebels continued to exchange sniper and mortar fire with government forces, but for the most part the city was calm and most of the city shops and markets were open and traffic was flowing freely. One bus driver stated \\"Homs is now safer than Damascus\\". One of a few areas where life still had not gone back to a full normal was the Armenian area, which reportedly was hit by several shells fired by the rebels from the Old City. On one occasion, a four-story building collapsed, killing five people and injuring 37 others. Fighter jets continued to bomb the rebel- held areas and Sky News described the scene in rebel-held areas and its frontlines as brutal low-tech guerrilla war. On 23 December, opposition activists claimed that the Syrian army launched bombs containing poisonous gas against rebel positions in the Bayada district, and that six or seven rebels were killed from it with up to 70 others hurt. Residents said that they did not know the nature of the gas. The claim of the nerve agent use was supported by Maj-Gen Abdoul-Aziz Jassius al-Shallal, the former chief of the Syrian military police, who had defected to the opposition. A U.S. official told Danger Room that, based on the video of the victims, \\"It just doesn't jibe with chemical weapons\\". The Israeli vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon, also voiced doubt at the rebel claims, citing the lack of corroboration to them. On 24 December, the Syrian Army attacked the rebel-held district of Deir Baalba and by 29 December, after several days of heavy fighting, the military had captured the district as rebel forces retreated from the area. The neighborhood had been under siege for months. With the loss of Deir Baalba, rebel forces were left only with Khalidiya and the Old City as the last remaining neighborhoods under their control. The next day, the military launched barrages of rockets into the remaining rebel-held neighborhoods. Following the capture of the district, opposition activists made claims that up to 150‚Äì220 people were rounded up by the military, taken to a petrochemical university and executed, with their bodies being burned or taken away. The opposition Shaam news network reported that about 150 charred bodies were found in the Deir Baalba neighborhood. However, there was no independent verification of the claims and one opposition activist was able to count only 27 bodies. =January‚ÄìFebruary 2013 army offensive and rebel counter- offensive= On 15 January 2013, government troops overran the village of Basatin al-Hasawiya on the edge of the city. Opposition activists claimed that during the operation pro-government militiamen and soldiers massacred 106 civilians, including women and children, by shooting, stabbing or possibly burning them to death. On 20 January, following rebel attempts to advance into new areas of Homs from the countryside, the Army launched a retaliatory offensive, to halt the rebel infiltration. Over three days, between 20 and 22 January, heavy fighting erupted in the western areas of Homs, where 130 soldiers and pro-government militiamen were killed or wounded, with 23 of them being confirmed as dead. By 25 January 120 civilians and 30‚Äì40 rebels were also reported to had been killed. Opposition activists claimed 10,000 pro- government militiamen were brought in as reinforcements from Tartous for the offensive. The Army was focusing on securing a vital a road junction on the outskirts of the city, which is on a supply line to government forces further in the interior of the country. On 26 January, more than 20 additional rebels and civilians were killed in fighting in the Jobar-Kafraya farm area on the south-western edge of Homs. A doctor from a makeshift underground hospital reported that opposition forces and civilians were surrounded. Rebels from the nearby town of Qusair were attempting to relieve the pressure on opposition forces on the western edge of Homs and in a counter-offensive two days previously managed to push back government forces slightly. However, the military continued to pound the area with artillery and air-strikes and the armed opposition had been weakened in the city after a drop in ammunition supplies in the weeks before due to a tightening of the Army siege on western areas. At the same time, BBC News reported that in the rest of the city, which is government-controlled, a 'fragile calm' had returned. On 14 February, the Syrian army captured the southwestern Jobar district, after rebels withdrew from the area. A week before, the military had also seized the southwestern Kafraya district.

By 6 March, government forces were bombarding the Old City and Khaldiyeh for four straight days. Situation in Homs, mid-March 2013 On 10 March, rebels infiltrated the Baba Amr area of Homs under the cover of night. The next morning, they launched an attack on government positions within the district. According to an opposition activist, Army checkpoints barely had time to realise that an attack was under way. Army troops sealed off several roads around Baba Amr and the Air force conducted air strikes on the district. The purpose of the rebel raid was reportedly to relieve pressure on the remaining rebel-held areas of the city that were still under siege by the military. At the same time, fighting was still ongoing in the rebel areas of Old Homs and Khaldiyeh, where the military was pressing its offensive. By 12 March, heavy fighting was still ongoing in both Khaldiyeh, where government tanks were in action, and Baba Amr, which was being hit by Army rocket fire. It remained unclear how much of Baba Amr the rebels had captured or continued to hold after the latest fighting in the area.Battle for Aleppo international airport in Syria‚Äôs north intensifies Civilians were forced to flee, as the army fired heavy machine guns into the district.

The district is located in-between the rebel-held Old Homs and Khalidiya districts, thus with its capture government forces had cut the link between those two areas and they had become completely separated and surrounded. =June‚ÄìJuly 2013 army offensive and capture of Khalidiya= On 28 June 2013, the Army captured the town of Al-Qariatayn near Homs. On 29 June, government troops launched an offensive on several rebel- held parts of Homs city, pounding the districts with air raids and mortar fire. \\"Military operations never stopped in Homs, but their pace increases according to priorities,\\" an Army officer told AFP. The military bombardment started at nine in the morning and lasted for three hours before the Army deployed ground troops. Syrian state TV was quoted as saying the Army had \\"great success\\" in the battle for Homs, \\"killing many terrorists in the Khalidiya district\\". Fighting raged around the Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque in Khalidiya, which had earlier caught fire. An activist in the Old City of Homs stated that the Army had \\"used rocket launchers for hours\\". He also commented that all water, phone and power had been cut off or blocked, save satellite communications. \\"The only thing they haven't blocked is the air we breathe\\" the activist reported. On 30 June, the second day of the offensive, government forces were attacking the old covered market which links the Old City with the Khalidiya in an attempt to cut the link between the two areas. Fighting was also ongoing in the Bab Hud district of Old Homs. On 3 July, an opposition activist stated that the fighting had become from building to building and the military was trying to take the rebel areas a block at a time. He said government forces were \\"cleaning\\" the areas of rebel fighters by firing mortar shells at buildings. During the evening of 5 July, government forces managed for the first time to breach Khalidiya, capturing several buildings in the district after breaking the rebel's first line of defenses. During the first two days of the offensive, according to SOHR, 32 government soldiers and militiamen had been killed, of which 24 died on the first day. Another eight government fighters were killed on 4 July. The number of rebels killed was unknown, but eight were reported killed on 5 July. On 6 July, it was reported that the battle was swinging in favor of the Army, as rebels were running low on weapons.

Meanwhile, most civilians had fled Khalidiya, with only rebel fighters and their families remaining, according to an opposition activist. By 11 July, rebel forces were preparing to retreat from the city, citing attrition of manpower and overwhelming military bombardment from government forces. Diplomats and opposition sources reported that the last opposition-held areas of Homs were set to fall within days to the Syrian army after the rebel forces decided to \\"sacrifice\\" the country's third-largest city to the government. On 22 July, opposition activists claimed Army shelling had destroyed the historic mausoleum of a companion of the Prophet Mohammed in the Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque. On 24 July, it was reported that government bombardment of rebel areas had abruptly ceased \\"in recent days\\" in response to rebels firing Grad rockets at government-supporting civilian areas in other parts of the city the previous week. However, on 25 July, more artillery attacks on Khalidiya were reported.Syria Lashes Out At US Move To Arm Rebels On 26 July, government forces advanced further into Khalidiya and the district of Jouret el-Shayah. Soldiers had reached 50 meters from the Khalid ibn al- Walid Mosque. By the next day, soldiers had entered the mosque area from the eastern side and the Army captured the mosque itself. Government and Hezbollah forces had also taken control of 60 percent of Khalidiya. That night, state TV broadcast a report with footage from inside the heavily damaged mosque. The footage showed the tomb's dome knocked out and a portion of the mosque appeared to have been burned. By 28 July, most of Khalidiya, estimated to be 70 percent, was under Army control, with fighting continuing on the northern and southern outskirts of the district. According to an Army officer, rebels were still controlling the northern part of Khalidiya. The military advances left only the Old Homs area under rebel control, where an estimated 1,000 rebel fighters remained. The next day, opposition activists confirmed 90 percent of the district had been captured by the Army, with scattered fighting continuing in the southern areas.

Government forces ambushed them near Khalidiya leaving at least 45 rebel fighters dead in fighting that lasted into the next morning. The remaining 18 fighters were missing. After the ambush, the Army launched an assault in an attempt to push into the Matahan area of Old Homs, where 150 rebels were putting up resistance, but their attack was beaten back. However, armoured Army reinforcements were sent from Damascus towards Homs. = Humanitarian operation = On 7 February 2014, a three-day truce was signed between the Syrian government and the rebels, under the auspices of the UN to allow the evacuation of civilians from the besieged neighborhoods of Homs.

On 6 April, it was initially reported a car-bomb that the rebels were preparing exploded prematurely in Old Homs killing 29 rebel fighters and leaving dozens missing. Later, reports suggested either an ambush by government forces or a Grad missile that hit a rebel ammunition depot in the Jourat al-Shayyah area left 50‚Äì75 rebels dead, including dozens of senior officers. Among those killed was also the FSA provincial commander, Abdul Qadir al-Homsi.

According to a pro-government source, the Army had breached the rebel defense line in the Bab Houd district. By 16 April, an estimated 300‚Äì1,000 rebel fighters had surrendered since March. Some of the remaining rebel fighters in Old Homs were getting ready for a fight to the death, preparing suicide belts for use in case the Army breaches their lines, as the opposition All4Syria news site predicted that the remaining rebel-held areas of the center of the city would fall within a week. During this time, the Syrian Opposition Coalition issued an urgent appeal as fears of a new massacre grew. On 18 April, a car-bomb exploded in a government-held district near a mosque killing 14 people, while Army troops captured a church in Old Homs and were continuing to advance. On 19 April, rebels launched a counter-offensive, which started with a suicide car-bomb attack on an Army checkpoint at the entrance of the government-held Jeb al-Jandali neighbourhood. Right before the attack, which killed five soldiers, other soldiers at the checkpoint defected and abandoned their positions. By the next day, opposition forces captured several buildings in the Jeb al-Jandali area. Two of the buildings that were captured were the Al Jala'a swimming pool and a school which government forces attempted to recapture during the day.

At this time, dozens of rebel fighters in Old Homs were trying to surrender, while others wanted to make a last stand and were sending suicide bombers against districts under government control, primarily the ones with an Alawite majority. At least five such bombings during the month killed more than 60 people. Fighters were also turning on comrades they suspected of a desire to desert, pushing them into battle. According to an opposition activist: \\"We expect Homs to fall. In the next few days, it could be under the regime's control.\\" On 29 April, a double rebel car-bomb attack in the Abbasiyeh neighbourhood of the government-held Zahra district left 168 people dead. Among those killed were 147 civilians, including 46 children, and 12 pro-government fighters. Nine fatalities were unidentified. =Rebel retreat from Homs= On 2 May 2014, a ceasefire agreement had been reached, under which the remaining 1,000 rebel fighters would be allowed to leave Homs and head to the rebel-controlled countryside north of the city. The evacuation was scheduled for the next day.Cease-fire, evacuation deal in Syria's Homs A matter of dispute remained in the agreement on whether the rebel-held al-Waer district, which is not connected to Old Homs, would be included in the deal.Cease-Fire, Evacuation Deal In Syria's Homs On 3 May, talks on the rebel withdrawal from Homs entered their final phase. According to the provincial governor, the deal \\"will be applied first in the Old City, then in Waer. The goal is to reach a peaceful solution that brings back security and government institutions.\\"Jihadist battle sparks exodus, Syria rebels on way out of Homs On 4 May, talks entered the implementation phase. Under the agreement, relief would be allowed into two Shiite pro-government towns in the northern province of Aleppo besieged by rebels. Also, Iranian and Lebanese prisoners held by the rebels would be released. On 7 May, the evacuation of rebels from Homs started with two buses transporting the first group of fighters toward rebel-held areas of northern Homs province. In all, more than 960 rebels were evacuated during the day, with another 250 scheduled to be transported out the next day.Syrian rebels claim massive Aleppo hotel bombing On 8 May, the final batch of 270 rebel fighters was expected to leave the city. However, rebels in Aleppo province blocked aid convoys that were supposed to bring food and medical supplies to two besieged government-held Shiite towns per the established agreement. Due to the failure of the rebels to uphold their side of the agreement, government forces blocked the remaining rebels in Old Homs from leaving. The convoys were not allowed to enter the towns the previous day as well by the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. During the afternoon of 9 May, the last of the rebels retreated from Homs after the aid convoys were allowed to enter the Shiite towns. Shortly after, hundreds of residents of Old Homs started to return to the area. =Siege of al-Waer neighbourhood= Rebels and civilians prepare to evacuate the Waer neighbourhood of Homs and head to Jarabulus after an agreement to surrender the area to government forces Rebels and civilians who rejected the retreat deal in May 2014 concentrated in the Al-Waer neighborhood of Homs which continued to be besieged. A new surrender deal was announced 12 September 2016, that was to bring the al-Waer neighborhood under government control while evacuating about 300 rebel fighters to the northern Homs countryside. The rebels began the execution of the deal on 22 September. However, the deal was put on hold in November 2016, with Syrian Army resuming its assault on the district. On 13 March 2017, the first batch of remaining rebels in the Waer neighbourhood agreed to leave Homs with their families and depart to Jarabulus. The evacuation of rebels along with their family members began on 18 March. On 27 March, 1,850 rebels and residents departed the neighbourhood in 45 buses. A final batch of 3,000 people, including 700 rebels, left Homs on 21 May. 1,150 rebels chose to stay and surrendered their weapons. With this, the Syrian government regained full control of Homs. Tactical considerations During the siege, some analysts have noted a shift of tactics informing the Syrian Army's subsequent general approach to war: while the army had been on the front lines during the early stages of the conflict, after the 2012 Baba Amr offensive ‚Äìwhere it experienced heavy casualties‚Äì the new approach (tested with the Khalidiya offensive, 2013) consists of charging the militias with dislodging the rebel forces, with the army supporting from behind with their superior armaments and air power, then asserting control once the fighting is over.  International reactions  * United Nations The U.N. Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon says he has received \\"grisly reports\\" that Syrian government forces are arbitrarily executing, imprisoning and torturing people in Homs after opposition fighters in Bab Amr retreated. > \\"A major assault on Homs took place yesterday,\\" Ban told the U.N. General > Assembly in New York City on 2 March 2012. \\"Civilian losses have clearly > been heavy. We continue to received grisly reports of summary executions, > arbitrary detentions and torture. This atrocious assault is all the more > appalling for having been waged by the government itself, systematically > attacking its own people\\". Activists said that government forces were > rounding up people aged between 14-50 and executing them in batches. * France Assad's government had \\"broken all the limits of barbarism\\". French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said. \\"And when I see the Syrian president paraded around this voting station in Damascus for this phony referendum, it makes you deeply indignant,\\" he told RTL radio. Juppe said he felt \\"immensely frustrated\\" at difficulties in obtaining security guarantees to enable wounded civilians and Western journalists to be evacuated from Homs. In April 2012, French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, accused Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of seeking to \\"wipe Homs from the map\\", comparing his campaign to the Libyan government's attacks on the city of Benghazi. \\"Bashar al-Assad is lying in a shameful way, he wants to wipe Homs from the map like (former Libyan leader Muammar) Gaddafi wanted to wipe Benghazi from the map,\\" Sarkozy said.

The clan predominantly resides in the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The name originates from Mankot, which is now known as Ramkot. The chain of rulers who ruled ramkote descended from Raja Sarbahladhar(765-801 AD).He was a religious ruler and a great devotee of sadhus and saints. According to Nargis, a Peer Roshan Shah Vali reached Jammu and told this king that he will have to face mohammaden invaders but finally he will remain unhurt and safe.Therefore upon his death Raja built a tomb for the Peer. One of his descendants, Raja Bajjrala Dhar found this venerth town in northeast of Jammu. At that time it was part of Jasrota Kingdome founded by Raja Jasdev and handed it over to Raja Karandev. However Karandev's eldest son Raja Bhuj Dev extended his rule upto Surinsar and established a new kingdom of Babbarhgar known as Bhabbapur in Rajtrangani.This place is known as Bhabore in moderen times.Raja karan dev gifted this kingdom to his grandson Raja Manak Dev in the name of Manipur who built a fort on the bank of Basanter Nallah and named this capital as Mankote. After the death of Raja Bhoj Dev in the battle with Nasar- ul-Din I Bikrami 1032, his eldest son Bhrorak became Raja of Mankot and his descendants sobriquet as Mankotia Rajputs. The 2nd son Raja Avtar Dev sat on the throne of Jammu kingdom. The 3rd son was given Jasrota kingdom. In the olden times Jasrota had been a very flourishing town and the Jasrota was named after the name of his son Jas Dev and the descendants of Raja Karan Dev established their capital in Jasrota. The descendants of this clan sobriquet as Jasrotia Rajputs.In the times of Maharaja Ranjeeet Singh of Punjab, Jasrota was given to Raja Hira Singh, a one time very close confidante of the Maharaja. With the killing of Raja Hira Singh, Jasrota turned into ruins and became a jungle. The palaces of repute in the past were demolished.His descendants are known as Mankotias. It was renamed by Raja Suchet Singh (1822-43) as Ramkote.

Her mixed- media paintings have been acclaimed for their symbolic imagery, rich colors, textures, and devotion to the written word.  Early years  Alexandra Eldridge was born in Mountainside, New Jersey and spent her childhood in a large Victorian house as one of seven children of Harry and Wende Devlin who wrote and illustrated 27 children's books and collaborated on two nationally syndicated comic strips: Fullhouse, which was based on the life of their busy household; and Raggmopp, which told the family's story through their dog's eyes.Lynn Cline.Isolation in Europe unifies art and life, p. 26. The New Mexican, August 21, 2006. Eldridge's parents were both portrait painters and Harry wrote and illustrated books on American architecture.  Golgonooza  Eldridge attended Ohio University, where she was in the Honors Cutler Program majoring in fine arts and creative writing and graduated summa cum laude. In 1969, she married her art professor, Aethelred Eldridge, and settled into a 70-acre farm near Athens, Ohio that was based on the writings, teachings and philosophy of Romantic-era poet and painter William Blake. The farm and arts organization which also included an establishment for the handmade book, was called Golgonooza after Blakes‚Äô visionary city of art. During that period at Golgonooza, Eldridge gave birth to two boys, Saxon and Sebastian. She painted, ran the arts program, grew organic vegetables and became immersed in reading Blake's works. On weekends, students and travelers came for readings, plays, pageants and outdoor performances. ‚ÄúIt was our land and our property, but was somewhat communal. Our life was about the discussion of art, and the discussion of art and spirituality‚Ä¶People came from all over just to be in the midst of this sort of thing.\\" Richard Garriott-Stejskal.Artisan finds beauty in chaos has ethereal effect, p. 41. The Albuquerque Tribune, June 21, 2002. Her life at Golgonooza lasted 17 years. ‚ÄúI had to leave that situation --- the community and my husband. I had to leave to become my own teacher. I went to see a psychic for the first time in my life. She told me that I was going to the Southwest. I said that I knew nothing about it. She said that the Southwest is where you need to be.‚Äù  Santa Fe  In 1987, following her divorce, she moved to Santa Fe to raise her children and pursue her career in art with studies at the Santa Fe Institute of Fine Art and workshops in Florence, Cambridge, and New York. She continues to reside in Santa Fe. Influences Eldridge has described her work as metaphorical and mytho- poetic. She says she is influenced by mysticism and has adopted many of Blake's views of spirituality and its connection to art. She has also cited influences such as Carl Jung, the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke, filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky and the teachings of Rumi. Style Eldridge works in mixed media on paper or panel. She uses Venetian plaster and creates images with pigment, pencil, and elements of collage. She rarely uses paint, instead she scratches through layers of the plaster to make lines. She burnishes the final layer to make the work shine and reveal the colors beneath. The colorful surfaces are distressed and incised with symbols, words, phrases and collage. Eldridge has said her paintings have a narrative, but without a beginning or end.Bill Ward. Artist Spotlight, p. 11. The Magazine, November 1999. Eldridge has described the process as an attempt to seek the unknown, \\"to go deeply in to the heart of the mystery, to make the soul fly out of things. I‚Äôll go into the studio and begin. I may be in some curious state of being. I'll paint for a number of hours, and then, all of a sudden it reveals itself to me -- what's going on with me. Tears start coming up and all the other strong feelings. All this conspires and works together. I'm in a state of joy -- near ecstasy -- when I'm painting. Art is about an encounter with something -- whether it be the unseen, an emotion, a feeling -- and then you have to have the courage to collaborate with that. My work also has a lot to do with the need to sensually connect to another or to my own deepest regions. Love motivates me enormously.\\"Evan West. Finding Blake in the Symbology of Alexandra Eldridge, p. 7. The Bachelor, February 1999. Symbolism Eldridge has been credited with creating her own vocabulary of symbols. Ordinary objects like birthday cakes, rabbits, ladders, and eggs often appear in her works. After the death of close friend in 2011, Eldridge said she found significance an image of a triptych of ladders. ‚ÄúEach ladder came into being as a revelation to me, each offering a deeper understanding of self-exploration, of death, of rebirth, and of the existence of eternity.‚Äù After spending three-weeks in India, she returned to Santa Fe where a friend was dying from a terminal illness. ‚ÄúI spent three weeks in India --- slowing down, getting very still. Boats and water appeared in my painting when I returned. I see the boats as symbols of being guided on the waters of the collective unconscious. There is a watery feeling to the work in the technique as well as in the images. Everything is dissolving as the new self insists on being born.‚Äù . Previews, pgs. 48,65. The Magazine, September 2011. Although her images are infused with meanings, Eldridge has said, \\"It is tempting, perhaps even comforting, to want to nail images down with meaning. But that can kill an image's ability to grow and to instruct.‚Äù Eldridge says much of her work is spontaneous. \\"It's amazing how much the unconscious is always at play. This self-discovery is always going on. This stuff comes through and then you stand back and you look and say, 'Look at who you are now.'\\" Travel Eldridge has said travelling is an important part of her creative process. She has had artist residencies on the Island of Elba, Italy and the Valparaiso Foundation in Almeria, Spain. While spending a month in Paris, she said she took on the role of a wanderer. ‚ÄúI came to see that this sensibility of the ‚Äòaimless stroller‚Äô---vigilant, alert, with no destination, moving easily from the interior to the exterior worlds--- was my sensibility.‚Äù. Previews, p. 7. The Magazine, September 2011. During her time in Paris, she was invited to paint a mural in the city‚Äôs 17th century Palace des Vosges. While elements of her travels appear in her work, Eldridge says she does not paint pictures of foreign lands. Rather, her images are of inner landscapes, to look at her paintings is as if to interrupt a fairy tale or dream. Often, parts of the places she visits emerge in her work. For example, when she was staying in a medieval monastery on the Island of Elba off the coast of Italy, she mixed the beach‚Äôs black sand into the plaster of one painting. In Morocco, she bought pigments at a marketplace and stirred them into a new work. Other bits of Morocco began to appear in her work in the colors of pink and red, as well as the inclusion of old doors.

Eldridge acquired the plates from a friend, and once cleaned from 100 years of dust, they revealed images of fairy-like children from a Texas portrait studio from around 1900. Eldridge partnered with London artist Predrag Pajdic on a project called \\"There Is No Such Thing As The End,\\" which re-imagined those images on vintage Chinese scrolls through a palimpsest of painting, printing, collage and drawing.

Geography Trevaunance Cove is on the north Cornish coast and is sheltered to the west by a headland but is open to sea and wind from the north and north-east. The cove is linked to St Agnes by road and footpaths through Travaunance Coombe. To the east, within 500 m, is Trevellas Porth and the Blue Hill mines, which are within the St Agnes Mining District in the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cove is of national importance for its geology, because it is part of a classical site for granite mineralisation and two ore-bearing mineral veins can be seen in the cliff. It is listed in the Geological Conservation Review and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is also within the St Agnes heritage coast and the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. History There use to be a small market which does not appear on any charter, although it was said to have been held from time immemorial for all wares and provisions except corn. A local land-owner, Mr Tonkin was given the right for a weekly market and two fairs via a Queen's patent in 1706. It was revoked following a petition from the inhabitants of Truro. The market survived and was still being held on Thursday's in 1838. The Tonkin family attempted to create a harbour in the cove in 1632 and again in 1684. A third attempt in 1699 was made with the assistant of the engineer Henry Winstanley, who died in 1703 on the Eddystone Lighthouse. His harbour was destroyed by a violent storm in 1705. Five years later, at a cost of ¬£6,000, Mr Tonkin built foundations of imported Lyas stone from Aberddaw, south Wales which was laid in hot lime. Following further damage and erosion, by 1794 a ‚Ä≥jetty pier‚Ä≥ of local ‚Ä≥moorstone‚Ä≥ was built costing ¬£10,000, with the expenses being covered by a company of gentlemen which traded in coal, lime, slate, etc. References External links * Cornwall online Category:Populated coastal places in Cornwall Category:Ports and harbours of Cornwall ","title":"Trevaunance Cove"},{"id":"33609124","text":"Fern√£o de Oliveira (1507 - c.1581), sometimes named Fernando de Oliveira, was a Portuguese grammarian, Dominican friar, historian, cartographer, naval pilot and theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding.

While the battery was under heavy fire during the Battle of Buena Vista, on February 23, 1847, General Zachary Taylor road up to Captain Bragg's guns. When Bragg asked the General what he should do, the general allegedly replied, \\"A little more grape, Captain Bragg.\\" This event first raised the young captain to national prominence. The very guns were lying in the Little Rock Arsenal when it was seized by the Arkansas State Militia before the state seceded. Two of the guns were issued to the Crawford Artillery, a battery organized in Crawford County by James T. Stewart.

Pearce. Pearce's Division, comprised one part of the Southern force under the overall command of Confederate Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch. The other two components of the Southern force were McCulloch's own Western Army, consisting one Louisiana regiment, one Texas regiment, two Arkansas regiments and one battalion of Arkansas Confederate Troops, and Major General Sterling Price's Missouri State Guard.Piston, William Garrett & Richard W.

The battery elected David Provence as captain on September 17, 1861. On March 7 and 8, 1862, during the Battle of Pea Ridge, the battery was assigned to Major General Benjamin McCulloch's Division of Major General Earl Van Dorn's Army of the West. Following the Confederate defeat at Pea Ridge, Van Dorn's Army retreated first to Van Buren and then moved east before boarding river boats and beginning a move to link up with Confederate forces massing near Corinth Mississippi. The Fort Smith Battery was sent east of the Mississippi River and served there for the rest of the war. Captain Reid would later command yet another battery during the Battle of Prairie Grove, but that organization bore no relation to the Fort Smith Battery. Captain David Provence was elected commander of the re-organized battery. Most of the men originally assigned to the Fort Smith Artillery subsequently reenlisted in Confederate service in Provence's Arkansas Battery (1st Arkansas Light Artillery). The battery retained the name and battery colors of the Fort Smith Artillery, but it was officially referred to as Provence's, and later Rivers', Battery Arkansas Light Artillery. A comparison of enlistment documents between the two units indicates that about three fourths of the original Fort Smith Artillery Battery continued to serve with the battery in Confederate service.

The army withdrew to winterquarters near Dalton Georgia, where the temporary commander, Lieutenant General William Hardee attempted to rebuild the wreckage of the army. On December 6, 1863, five of the hardest hit batteries, Scogins, Massenburg's, Waters, Baxters and Rivers Batteries were stripped of their remaining horses and assigned to garrison duty at Atlanta. On February 16, 1864, Captain Rivers signed a voucher for clothing received at Dalton Georgia, including 75 Jackets and 75 Pants. The battery muster roll for March and April 1864 show the unit's station as Atlanta Georgia, and the comments on the roll state \\"the battery has been stationed at this place since last mustered the men have been sober and soldierly in their conduct.\\" Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman invaded Georgia from the vicinity of Chattanooga, Tennessee, beginning in May 1864, opposed by the Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston. Johnston's Army of Tennessee withdrew toward Atlanta in the face of successive flanking maneuvers by Sherman's group of armies. In July, the Confederate president replaced Johnston with the more aggressive John Bell Hood, who began challenging the Union Army in a series of damaging frontal assaults. Atlanta was ringed with formidable earthworks, including which were armed with an array of guns including 6 and 12 pounder howitzers, Wiard rifles, 24 pounder rifles and several other heavy cannon brought north from the defenses at Mobile. These guns on Atlanta's perimeter were manned by a collection of six depleted batteries from the Army of Tennessee, including Rivers' Arkansas Battery. These batteries were placed under the command of the Georgia militia.Daniels, Larry. Cannoneers in Gray: The Field Artillery of the Army of Tennessee, 1861-1865. (Tuscaloosa, AL: Fire Ant Books, 2005), page 168.

The right wing of Sherman's force was the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick was ordered to threaten Macon in order to screen the movements of Howard's column. By demonstrating against Macon, Kilpatrick and his cavalry were able to pin down a significant number of Confederate troops in the city. Unable and unwilling to leave the important industrial city undefended, Southern commanders were prevented from moving aggressively against General Sherman's main columns. This prevented them from attacking and harassing his main columns during the early stages of the March to the Sea when his units were strung out and his supply trains were vulnerable.Cox, Dale, \\"Battle of Walnut Creek - Macon, Georgia\\", ExploreSouthernHistory.com, Accessed 10 February 2014 The Battle of Walnut Creek, or Second Battle of Dunlap Farm as it is also known, developed when Kilpatrick was ordered to sweep in close to Macon to screen the movements of Sherman's right column, which was starting its turn to the east after appearing to threaten Macon. Kilpatrick's forces threatening Macon included the 10th Ohio Cavalry, 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry, 92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry, and the 10th Wisconsin Battery. The Confederate defenders at Macon included, among others, the 1st and 2nd Convalescent Regiments, from the hospital located there. General Howell Cobb, who commanded the Confederates in Macon, was blessed with an abundance of artillery, totaling 39 guns. The defense was lucky to have several battalions of artillery, known as the Reserve Artillery, Army of Tennessee, which were left by General Hood when he began his invasion of Tennessee after the fall of Atlanta. The entire Reserve Artillery was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Hallonquist. This force included the reserved artillery battalions of Waddell, Martian, and Palmer. Waddell's men had a full complement of ammunition for their guns, but not horses to pull them. Palmer's force had both ammunition and horses, while Martians battalion had a full complement of ammunition, but no horses; as a result most of the artilleryman fought as infantry. The artillery units included troops from Curry's, Bellany's, Guist's, Howell's, Plamers, Rivers, and Captain Edmund D. Baxter's Light Artillery Companies, deployed as infantry. These men were commanded by Captain Albrough. The batteries of Rivers and Prichard were consolidated and the consolidated unit manned four twelve-pounder howitzers. Rivers' guns responded to an attack by at 3:30 p.m. by the Beebe's Battery.Iobst, Richard W. Civil War Macon: The History of a Confederate City. Macon, Ga: Mercer University Press, 1999, page 348 Confederate forces brought at least nine cannon into action, some of them firing from the heights at Fort Hawkins, Cobb's forces pounded the Federals on Dunlap's Hill. Confederate reinforcements poured to the front. As fighting swirled around Dunlap's Hill, so named because it was part of the Dunlap Farm and the location of the Dunlap house, Kilpatrick launched a second attack against the Central of Georgia railroad trestle over Walnut Creek. This advance was quickly blunted by Confederate defenders. As a Confederate counterattack retook the guns on the crest of Dunlap's Hill, Kilpatrick decided that he had accomplished his mission and began to fall back. Confederate cavalry under General Joseph Wheeler was now on the field and shadowed the Union withdrawal. The battery's muster rolls show that they remained on station a Macon Georgia through at least December 1864.Content Source: The National Archives, Publication Number: M317, Publication Title: Compiled Service Records of Confederate Soldiers Who Served in Organizations from the State of Arkansas, Content Source: NARA, National Archives Catalog ID: 586957, National Archives Catalog Title: Carded Records Showing Military Service of Soldiers Who Fought in Confederate Organizations , compiled 1903 - 1927, documenting the period 1861 ‚Äì 1865, Record Group: 109, State: Arkansas, Short Description: NARA M317.
