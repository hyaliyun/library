He was one of the leaders of the opposition of the nobility against King Gustav III of Sweden in 1789. He also authored a critical book about Gustav III: Anekdoter till svenska historien under Gustaf III:s regering.Nordisk familjebok  Biography  Adolf Ludvig Hamilton was the son of Gustaf David Hamilton. He became an ensign in 1759 and in 1766 he became chamberlain for the then crown prince Gustav III (later King Gustav III of Sweden). In 1771 he became chamberlain for Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. He resigned from this later post in 1782 and moved to the Blomberg estate in V√§sterg√∂tland, Sweden. Count Hamilton was initially in favor of King Gustav III. However, he gradually developed a considerable hatred against the king, and after his resignation as chamberlain he joined the opposition in the Riksdag of the Estates. He was the first to proclaim in the Rikssalen at Stockholm Palace that the Act of Union and Security proposed by King Gustav III needed to be discussed separately by the four Estates. The act essentially provided King Gustav III tremendous power and simultaneously dramatically reduced the rights and privileges of the nobility. Hamilton was initially much in favor of the French revolution, however, after observing the tyranny during the Reign of Terror his feelings towards Jacobinism became lukewarm and in 1800 he had reversed his position and became a royalist. Hamilton had a French education and his writings and speeches often included satire. He was known and feared for his epigrams. After his resignation as a chamberlain he kept a diary, which is kept at the Hamiltonian archive at Barseb√§ck Castle. At older age, probably in the year 1795, he completed the book Anecdoter till Gustaf III:s och Gustaf IV Adolfs historia, which contains many anecdotes about the influential people in the mid-18th century Sweden. He was the father of Gustaf Wathier Hamilton.

Mendis had arrived in the UK in October 1973 on a twelve-month student visa but overstayed his visa. He was an active supporter of the Tamils and, in the UK, the Revolutionary Communist Group and claimed danger of death if he was sent back to Sri Lanka. Following a march to protest against his deportation on 20 December 1986 he ran into the Church of the Ascension and claimed the right of sanctuary. He stayed in the church for the next two years with the help of the rector John Methuen. The church became the focus of the \\"Viraj Mendis Defence Campaign\\" against his deportation. In late 1988 his supporters were invited to address an assembly at Burnage High School, Pupils were encouraged to enlist the help of parents to his cause. One parent took exception to this and contacted the Manchester Evening News, the story was then picked up on by The Daily Telegraph, shortly after Mendis was removed. On 18 January 1989 police raided the church and arrested Mendis, which led to a large demonstration and questions in the House of Commons. He was deported back to Sri Lanka and his fears did not materialize. Mendis claimed his case had received so much publicity that the Sri Lankan government did not dare to harm him. He later moved to Germany and became chairperson of the International Human Rights Association in Bremen (Internationaler Menschenrechtsverein Bremen) and worked defending refugees facing deportation, and on Tamil liberation. In 2010 he was refused permission to enter Britain for the funeral service of John Methuen.

It chronicles the National Hockey League's (NHL) Philadelphia Flyers from their beginnings as an expansion team in 1967, to their back-to-back Stanley Cup championships (1974, 1975), and three straight Finals appearances (1974‚Äì76). The film includes clips and photos from the era, along with interviews with players, writers, broadcasters, and other individuals involved with the Flyers and/or NHL hockey during that period. It is narrated by Liev Schreiber.  Overview  Broad Street Bullies begins with the line, \\"In any great drama, you need heroes and villains. The Flyers were both.\\" The film then gives a brief history of ice hockey and the National Hockey League. It tells of founder Ed Snider's quest to bring an expansion team to Philadelphia, then follows the creation of the team and the city's initial unenthusiastic response to the new team. The documentary shows how the early Flyers were physically beaten by the St. Louis Blues, and their consequent decisions to bring in bigger and tougher players, so as not to be pushed around in the post season. This resulted in an aggressive team that bent rules, and used fighting and intimidation as a tactic ‚Äì nicknamed the \\"Broad Street Bullies\\". Broad Street Bullies profiles Dave \\"The Hammer\\" Schultz, his impact on the team, and influence on the development of a new attitude towards ice hockey in Philadelphia. Schultz was critical in the team's first post-season series win. The documentary then describes the re- acquisition of goaltender Bernie Parent, with a minor biographical section on him. It then illustrates the talent on the Philadelphia roster, and examines the relationship between the Flyers organization and the city of Philadelphia, highlighting the problems, both economic and sports-related, of the city and its new love affair with the team. After a brief look at the Flyers' success in the 1973‚Äì74 regular season, head coach Fred \\"the Fog\\" Shero is introduced. It then looks at the Flyers-Rangers series that resulted in the first expansion team defeating an original six team in a playoff series. The film then examines the Flyers' Stanley Cup Finals series against the Boston Bruins. The documentary also covers the odd relationship between singer Kate Smith and the Flyers' team. It then focuses on the final game of the series, which culminated in the Flyers' first Stanley Cup championship, as well as the response by fans. The documentary explores the dichotomy between the love of the team in Philadelphia and the hate it generated in other cities, epitomized by Flyer great Bobby Clarke. A brief mention is made of the LCB line (Reggie Leach-Clarke-Bill Barber). The post-season title defense of the Stanley Cup begins with a section on the Islanders coming back from a 3‚Äì0 deficit to tie the series, and the Flyers' favorite bar, Rexy's, burning down. It moves on to the Flyers' second Stanley Cup Finals series against the Buffalo Sabres and the oddities of the series, including a game played in fog, and a bat flying around the ice. Several clips are shown of the Flyers winning their second Cup, and of the players' fathers being on hand to celebrate the championship with their sons. The documentary then returns to Schultz and a song he recorded, and examines his fighting tendency and the impact it had on other teams around the league. It also looks at how the game itself was affected by the Flyers' aggressive style. The film then turns its attention to an exhibition game against the Russian Red Army team, examining the importance of the game, both in terms of culture and sport, and highlighting the Flyers' victory. The film then shows how the Flyers forced the NHL to institute new rules to clean up the game. In covering the \\"Bullies\\" third Stanley Cup Finals appearance against the Montreal Canadiens, the film illustrates the differences between the Flyers' aggressive, physical style, and the Canadians' traditional skill game; and looking at the impact Larry Robinson had in the series as a physical force for Montreal. After discussing the Flyers' defeat, the documentary wraps up with players from the team talking about their legacy and how they would not change the way they played. This is followed by a summary of the \\"Bullies\\" era, and the team's lasting impact in Philadelphia.  Reaction  Broad Street Bullies received several positive reviews. Senior NHL writer Chris Botta called the documentary \\"outstanding\\" and said, \\"What Boogie Nights was to the adult film industry, HBO's doc is to the most notorious team in NHL history.\\" Yahoo's Greg Wyshynski provided 10 top reasons to watch the documentary and gave it an overall grade of B. Wyshynski stated that the grade was only a \\"B because the film loses a bit of steam at the end and fails to carry some of the more interesting aspects of its narrative through the story. For Philly fans, it may not offer more than you already know about the Bullies, and there's hardly any connection to the current team.\\" Keith Groller called the film \\"the latest in a long line of well-done sports documentaries by HBO\\". He further states, \\"this hour-long production provides a great trip down memory lane\\". Steve Lepore of Puck the Media called it unfocused at times, but \\"overall a fantastic, gritty, winning production.\\" Flyers Chairman Ed Snider refers to the film as \\"an excellent and well- produced documentary that portrays the evolution of the Philadelphia Flyers\\", and states that \\"It brings back many wonderful memories for me, and it uncovers some new insights into the great story of our two Stanley Cup championship teams. We are truly honored that this part of Philadelphia Flyers' history will be seen nationally on HBO.\\" Snider was not the only former member of Flyers' personnel to be moved by the film. Former goalie Bernie Parent was brought to tears during an advance screening at the Wells Fargo Center. When asked about his emotions, Parent said, \\"We're getting older. With the sadness, there's joy involved. It's difficult to share the feelings right now.\\" The positive reviews were not limited to sports fans. The New York Post's TV critic, Linda Stasi states, \\"You don't have to be a hockey fan to love Broad Street Bullies or the team that inspired this hilarious, hell-raising hockey doc.\\" Stasi, who says she doesn't understand the fascination with watching sports, further said, \\"I am not the audience and yet, I couldn't stop watching it, couldn't stop laughing and couldn't stop rooting for the most ill-mannered, unsportsmanlike, toothless and ruthless team ever to take the ice.\\" Cast (Interviews) Larry Robinson was interviewed for the documentary.The HBO film's producer George Roy conducting one of its two dozen interviews with hockey historian Bruce \\"Scoop\\" Cooper.

In this case, the tool bits are of the brazed carbide type. Boring bar marked B A boring bar is a tool used in metalworking and woodworking. Boring is a technique used in many aspects of building. Woodworkers have used boring as a form of drilling for centuries. In woodworking, the boring tool is static in size and used to form circular plunge cuts. In metalworking, boring is slightly different in that the hole that results need not be circular. In metal boring the tool can be plunged and dragged on the X or Y axes to create a slot or asymmetrical hole or channel, or it may be moved only in an up-and- down motion (on the Z axis) to create a perfect circular hole. Components Modern boring tools have three primary components although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (bar holder) is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the dial screw. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if the cutting tool is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called unbalanced gyroscope precession.http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/mech.htm Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the boring tool. Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs. Boring machines Boring can be done on mills, lathes or drill press machines, either with a boring head or with just a boring tool. The shorter the distance between the tool holder and the material, the less distortion created from vibration or unbalanced gyroscopic effects. The greater the distance (static or dynamic mounts) the more flex in the tool or an increase in the imbalance of a moving tool. Use of a boring head increases the mass of the tool holder and decreases the distance. If a vibration is created it will be at a higher frequency and the deflection of the tool from the desired path will be much smaller and easier to erase through repetitive tool passes. In the case of a dynamic tool (mill or press), the balance of the tool can be adjusted with counterweights if the tool is mounted perpendicular to the shaft or the tool length can be decreased.

They record and release music through their own label, Rosemont Recordings. They're noted for their unique sound which combines the elements of \\"traditional\\" improvisational blues and jazz with the \\"non traditional\\" styles of heavy metal, ambient, progressive rock and electronica. The majority of their music is performed together live in a studio without any prior rehearsals or sharing of musical thoughts before the recording process begins. This gives their recordings an overall warm organic feel that creates a completely refreshing listening experience. Although the band rarely plays live in front of an audience, they've been known to perform one-off shows over the past 15 years. History =Formation (1995)= The 16 Deadly Improvs were originally conceived in 1995 as a studio project involving musicians from the New Brunswick, New Jersey alternative rock scene of the early 1990s: Nick Bohensky, Jeff Bridi, Mark Nowak and Dave Wilson of prog-metallers Bald Red Lady; Gene Bohensky of alt rock band Three Islands; Vin Villanueva from hardcore outfits Headstrong and Vision. Their aim was to experiment as an improvisational unit using the well-honed skills of each band member, while allowing for randomness in execution by encouraging members to play out of their comfort zone. This meant, at times, for certain members of the band to play completely different instruments other than their specialty. Musically, John Wetton era King Crimson was a major influence and starting point for the improvisational approach. Other notable artists that influenced their sound include Brian Eno, Rain Tree Crow, Yes, Gong, The Legendary Pink Dots, Porcupine Tree, Radiohead, Rush and Pink Floyd. After recording in July 1995, the resulting session became The 16 Deadly Improvs, so named because of the editing of the sessions into what turned out to be 16 distinct tracks. While deemed a success by the unit, it was believed at the time that the project had run its course as Villanueva relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan and began concentrating more on jazz music and Nowak settled in Brooklyn, New York. =The Return and The Challenge (2005‚Äì2006)= Nearly a decade had passed, with each of its members involved in other musical projects including Bridi, Bohensky and Wilson forming the hard-edged metal outfit, To The Bone. The relocation of Villanueva back to the east coast of the US in 2004 prompted the group to rejoin forces and adopt the moniker The 16 Deadly Improvs, recording 2005's The Return of The 16 Deadly Improvs. In January 2006, the band recorded what was to become The Challenge of The 16 Deadly Improvs. While largely instrumental, it was the first album to feature the addition of vocals by Nowak and Bridi, who took two songs each on which to overdub their parts; a trend that has continued through each subsequent album. The Challenge would also become the first release to be made available to the public. =The Revenge and the Hospitality soundtrack (2007‚Äì2009)= 2007 brought another unexpected relocation, with the departure of Nowak to Australia. However, the band found ways to continue to work, setting up one day sessions when all six members were available. During this time, the focus began to shift towards more overdubs of the raw tracks and additional production, all along retaining the original concept of improvisational music to the core. In 2008, the band released The Revenge of The 16 Deadly Improvs with original artwork commissioned exclusively for the project by New Jersey-based graphic artist Keith Smerak of E6 Creative Group.Element Six Creative Group The album features guest vocalist Jenn Weiss on the jazzy track \\"2/9\\" as well as additional lyrics being provided by Smerak on \\"In The Black\\" and the aforementioned \\"2/9\\". The Revenge was almost instantly well received in prog- circles. Progressive rock site dprp.net stated \\"that some of the pieces aren‚Äôt a million miles removed from, say, Red-era King Crimson or even the instrumentals on Bowie‚Äôs Berlin albums (Low, \\"Heroes\\", Lodger). Most impressive is the way the improvisations often build and then devolve: this group (there are six members) can turn or stop on a dime, and they obviously are good at cueing each other when it‚Äôs time to take a new tack.\\"Dprp : Cd & Dvd Reviews Sea of Tranquility.org called The Revenge \\"a rock solid, seventy minute plus effort from top to bottom that is both full of risk and reward.\\"Review: \\"16 Deadly Improvs, The: The Revenge of the 16 Deadly Improvs\\" ‚Äì Sea of Tranquility ‚Äì The Web Destination for Progressive Music! During this time, an instrumental version of the track \\"2/9\\" from The Revenge was included in the soundtrack for the direct to DVD release of the indie horror film Hospitality directed by Tony Ducret.http://www.hospitalitythemovie.com The same year, the band recorded another session, which after being shelved for over a year, was edited and produced during 2009 for a 2010 release. =The Triumph (2010‚Äì2011)= The results from the 2008 session and the mixing, editing and production of 2009 became the band's fifth studio album, The Triumph of The 16 Deadly Improvs.The Triumph of the 16 Deadly Improvs ‚Äì The 16 Deadly Improvs  Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards  AllMusic Keith Smerak once again provided the exclusive artwork and design from his E6 studio.

The Reichswald in the winter near Kleve. The Klever Reichswald is an Imperial forest in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) between the Rivers Rhine and Meuse at the German Dutch border. The forest is located in the municipal territory of Kleve, Goch, Kranenburg and Bedburg-Hau. It is the largest coherent wooded area of the lower Rhine and the largest coherent public state forest of North Rhine- Westphalia with an area of 51 km2 (5100 ha).City Cleve: The Reichswald Landscape and forest The Reichswald is on the ridge of the lower Rhine, which was created by glaciers. In the Ice Age a range of hills were created, which contrasts the flat Rhine plain. 31 of the hills reach heights above 50 meters. One of the highest hills is the Rupenberg with 95 meters,see Photo of the marking stone with inscription ‚Äû95 m‚Äú located at the eastern end of the Reichswald. The forest is a closed mixed deciduous forest dominated by copper beech. For some areas the oak is predominant; for some other parts conifer forest is dominant. In the west the Reichswald merges into woodland of the province Gelderland in the Netherlands. These are almost closed over the municipalities of Milsbeek, Mook en Middelaar, Berg en Dal and Heumen to Nijmegen. Protected area Except small subareas the complete Reichswald is under landscape and nature protection. The majority is in areas of outstanding natural beauty: at AONB Waldgebiet Reichswald (ca. 3875 ha, in Kleve, Kranenburg and Goch), at AONB Reichswald (ca. 166 ha, in Bedburg-Hau) and at AONB Pfalzdorfer H√∂henrand and Nierstal (only subareas at Reichswald, in Goch). The northern forest areas near the core of Kleve could be counted to the Reichswald as well. They are at AONB Standort√ºbungsplatz einschlie√ülich der Umgebung westlich Kleve (ca. 126 ha) and at AONB Waldgebiet des Tiergartenwaldes (ca. 295 ha). In the northwest area of the Reichswald the protected areas 'Quellen am Stoppelberg' is (ca. 2,9 ha, in Kleve) and in the middle of the forest the protected area ‚ÄòGeldernberg‚Äô (ca. 580 ha, in Kleve, Kranenburg and Goch). ‚ÄòGeldernberg‚Äô is known as the core area of the Reichswald and is stated as the FFH-Area DE-4202-302 Reichswald, which puts it in the European network of protected areas Natura 2000. The AONB Geldenberg is of particular importance because it is the largest, largely closed, predominant hardwood old-growth forest in the Reichswald and is home to endangered species like the golden oriole, black woodpecker, honey buzzard and stag beetle. History In the Second World War, Klever Reichswald was the location of the Battle of the Reichswald, also known as Operation Veritable, in February and March 1945. In this protracted battle against British and Canadian troops on Germany's Western Front, German lines under General Alfred Schlemm (of the Luftwaffe) had been reequipped. The Siegfried Line was the most fortified in this area, and the troops were re-enforced by elite and experienced soldiers well prepared for protracted fighting. =Military manpower= The terrain largely nullified the Anglo-Canadians' advantages in equipment, armament and munitions, and manpower. On the German side, over 90,000 men fought in this battle, and 52,000 were taken prisoner. On the Anglo-Canadian side, nearly 200,000 men were engaged in the fighting, with 23,000 casualties. Geology As the Reichswald is on a glacial ridge, it is not subjected to flooding. The glacial gravel contains much loam from the northern German plain and this makes the surface extremely muddy when using the unmetalled roads during a rainy period.

It is important to remember that current, i, is charge (or electrons passed) per unit time. In cyclic voltammetry, the current passing through the electrode is limited by the diffusion of species to the electrode surface. This diffusion flux is influenced by the concentration gradient near the electrode. The concentration gradient, in turn, is affected by the concentration of species at the electrode, and how fast the species can diffuse through solution. By changing the cell voltage, the concentration of the species at the electrode surface is also changed, as set by the Nernst equation. Therefore, a faster voltage sweep causes a larger concentration gradient near the electrode, resulting in a higher current. Uses Using the relationships defined by this equation, the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species can be determined. Linear plots of ip vs. ŒΩ1/2 provide evidence for a chemically reversible redox process vs the cases where redox causes major structural change in the analyte. For species where the diffusion coefficient is known (or can be estimated), the slope of the plot of ip vs. ŒΩ1/2 provides information into the stoichiometry of the redox process.

Novillo scored the winner against Wellington Phoenix to send City through to their first ever A-league semi-final. As his short-term was about to expire, Novillo's contract with Melbourne City was extended for two years, taking a foreign visa slot. =Manisaspor= On 22 June 2016, it was announced that Melbourne City FC had agreed to transfer Novillo to Turkish second division club Manisaspor, for an undisclosed fee. Novillo made only six appearances for Manisaspor in an injury-plagued season with the club and left the club in the January 2017 transfer window. =Baniyas Club= In January 2017, Arabian Gulf League side Baniyas Club announced it had acquired Novillo for the remainder of the 2016/17 season. =Johor Darul Ta'zim FC= In May 2018, Novillo moved to Malaysian Super League club Johor Darul Ta'zim FC, the reigning league champions. He made an immediate impression at the club, scoring in his debut match against Selangor FA. But in the end of May, Novillo was dropped from JDT squad due poor performances after three matches, announced by TMJ itself. TMJ said, ‚ÄúEven after signing players for millions, if I see that those players aren‚Äôt performing after a few games, they can leave and I will look for their replacements for JDT. That‚Äôs never happened in Malaysian football, but this is JDT.‚Äù He also said, that Novillo had done well by scoring on his debut against Selangor (on May 12), but failed to replicate that form against Negeri Sembilan FA and PKNS FC. =Montreal Impact= On December 5, 2018, Novillo signed with the Montreal Impact that is managed by his former coach R√©mi Garde. On July 22, 2019, Montreal and Novillo agreed to terminate his contract with he club. International career Born in Lyon, France, Novillo is a France youth international, having earned caps at under-17 level. He has also represented the Martinique national football team.

Life He was son of John Sparke or Sparkes of Peterborough. Having been educated in his native city under a Mr. Warren, he was admitted a pensioner at St. John's College, Cambridge, on 11 July 1699, and graduated B.A. in 1704. Returning to Peterborough, he became registrar of Peterborough Cathedral. He devoted much time to antiquarian studies. In 1719, in a letter of Maurice Johnson to William Stukeley, he is mentioned as having lately arranged on a new method Lord Cardigan's library at Dean in Northamptonshire. He was also entrusted with the care of White Kennett's collection of early historical and theological documents that passed to the cathedral library, which he was to supply daily and augment. Kennett's biographer William Newton describes Sparke as ‚Äòof very good literature and very able to assist in that good design‚Äô. Together with his friend Timothy Neve, Sparke was the founder of the Gentleman's Society of Peterborough, and prevailed on Bishop Robert Clavering to allow it to meet in a room over the Saxon gate-house. In October 1722 he had become a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society, on which it was modelled. Sparke died on 20 July 1740, and was buried in Peterborough Cathedral, where there is a monument to him in the retro-choir. His wife Rebecca died on 27 March 1747, aged 56. Works In 1723 he edited two folio volumes entitled Histori√¶ Anglican√¶ Scriptores varii, e codicibus manuscriptis, of which both large and small paper editions were published. They contained the Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense, which later was attributed erroneously to John, abbot of Peterborough (1250‚Äì1262), by Simon Patrick and Henry Wharton. This was printed by Sparke from a transcript furnished to him by John Bridges of Lincoln's Inn, and, not having been collated with the original (among the Cotton. MSS. in the British Museum), contains errors. It was re-edited in 1845 for the Caxton Society by John Allen Giles. The Histori√¶ Anglican√¶ Scriptores included also William Fitzstephen's Life of St. Thomas Becket, the History of Peterborough Abbey by Hugh Candidus, Walter of Guisborough's Vita Eduardi, and the chronicles of Ralph of Coggeshall, Benedict of Peterborough, and others. Another volume contemplated by Sparke was to contain Whittleseye's Hereward of Peterborough.

The name originally stood for \\"Technology of Object-Oriented Languages and Systems\\" although later it was usually no longer expanded, the conference being known simply as \\"the TOOLS conference\\". The conferences ran from 1988 to 2012, with a hiatus in 2003-2007, and was revived in 2019. The first conference was held in Paris in 1988, organized by Eiffel Software. The TOOLS conference series started next year, in 1989. Over the following 15 years it held 45 sessions: TOOLS EUROPE (usually in Paris), TOOLS USA (usually in Santa Barbara, California), TOOLS PACIFIC (usually Sydney), TOOLS ASIA (Peking) and TOOLS EASTERN EUROPE. TOOLS has played a major role in the development of object technology; many seminal software concepts now taken for granted were first discussed at TOOLS. Invited speakers have included countless luminaries of science and industry such as Kent Beck, Robert Binder, Peter Coad, Alistair Cockburn, Steve Cook, James Coplien, Brad Cox, Miguel de Icaza, John Dvorak, Martin Fowler, Erich Gamma, Adele Goldberg, Richard Helms, Tony Hoare, Ivar Jacobson, Philippe Kahn, Alan Kay, Bertrand Meyer, Jim Miller, Robin Milner, David Parnas, Trygve Reenskaug, Michael Stal, Dave Thomas, David Taylor, Tony Wasserman and many others. In 2007, after an interruption of four years, TOOLS started again as an annual conference with an extended scope, encompassing not only objects and components but all modern approaches to software technology. TOOLS turned at that time from a single conference to a federated event hosting other conferences listed below. For these later editions of the conference, see the TOOLS page. In 2012, in its 50th edition, The Triumph of Objects was declared and the series provisionally closed.http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/#Personal In 2013, after the temporary end of TOOLS, the STAF conference, Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF)STAF 2013 was established to host some of the conferences previously hosted by TOOLS. In 2019, the TOOLS conference series restarted with TOOLS 50+1[http://tools2019.innopolis.ru/ organized by Innopolis University near Kazan, Russia. Goals and scope TOOLS is devoted to the study and application of advanced software development methods, techniques, tools and languages, with a special emphasis on object-oriented techniques, component-based development, model-based development and design patterns. The conference distinguishes itself by combining selective peer review process, as in academic conferences, with a strong practical slant and concern about relevance to industry.

Written by series creator Eric Kripke and directed by Kim Manners, the episode was first broadcast on May 15, 2008. The narrative follows the series' protagonists Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles)‚Äîbrothers who travel the continental United States hunting supernatural creatures‚Äîas they attempt to save the latter's soul from damnation. Having made a year-long demonic pact in the previous season finale, Dean has just one day left to live. The brothers must track down the demonic overlord Lilith, who holds Dean's contract. Lilith, meanwhile, is entertaining herself by possessing a young girl (Sierra McCormick) and terrorizing her family, a homage to the Twilight Zone episode \\"It's a Good Life\\". Marking the final appearance of Katie Cassidy as the demon Ruby, the episode was originally intended to feature the return of Samantha Ferris as recurring character Ellen Harvelle. The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean by giving in to his demonic abilities, but the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented the development of that storyline throughout the season. Dean is instead killed; the final scene of him in Hell was the \\"most complicated shot [the] visual effects department has ever done\\". The episode received high ratings for the season, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. The decision to follow through with Dean's Hell-bound contract was praised, as were the performances of Padalecki and Ackles. General consensus was that McCormick was \\"creepy\\" as Lilith, but lacked the menace of Fredric Lehne's Azazel of the second season. Background Supernatural follows brothers Sam (Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Ackles) as they travel the continental United States hunting supernatural creatures that pose a threat to society. At times, they are assisted by fellow \\"hunter\\" and family friend Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver). Their greatest enemies come in the form of demons, corrupted human souls that have escaped from Hell. A cloud of black smoke in their true form, they take possession of human hosts. Twenty-two years earlier than the series' main storyline, the demonic tyrant Azazel fed his blood to Sam and other infants, to imbue them with demonic abilities. He gathers them together in the second-season finale \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\" and coerces the young adults into a fight to the death to determine a leader for his demonic army. Sam is killed by the super-strong Jake Talley, but Dean sells his own soul to a crossroads demon in exchange for Sam's resurrection, a contract that leaves Dean with only a year to live. The Winchesters, Bobby, and fellow hunter Ellen Harvelle kill Jake and Azazel, but are too late to prevent the release of hundreds of demons from Hell. One of the freed demons is Ruby (Cassidy), a former witch who claims to oppose the demonic world. She frequently helps the brothers throughout the third season with her demon- killing knife and knowledge of witchcraft, but Dean mistrusts her manipulative nature. As the deadline approaches, the Winchesters learn that Azazel's successor, Lilith, holds the contract to Dean's deal. He now only has one day remaining before he is sent to Hell. Plot The episode begins with Dean Winchester (Ackles) being chased through a forest by a hellhound; as it mauls him, he awakens from his dream. His brother, Sam (Padalecki), tells him that Bobby has devised a way to locate Lilith, but unconvinced that it will succeed, Dean suggests he live up the rest of his time. Sam insists that he will be saved, but Dean feigns reassurance as he hallucinates a demonic- looking Sam. Bobby tracks Lilith to New Harmony, Indiana. Dean does not want to attack unprepared, but he refuses to seek help from Ruby. Sam secretly summons her and asks for her knife, and Ruby tells him that his dormant psychic abilities could easily kill Lilith, whose guard is down as she is on \\"shore leave\\". Sam considers the alternative, but Dean shows up and tricks Ruby into a devil's trap‚Äîmystical symbols capable of rendering a demon powerless‚Äîand the brothers take her knife and leave. Despite Dean's objections, Bobby insists that he accompany them, and draws attention to Dean's hallucinations. With his demise rapidly approaching, Dean has begun \\"piercing the veil\\", allowing him to glimpse the demons' true forms. When the trio arrive in New Harmony, they discover that Lilith is possessing a young girl (McCormick) and terrorizing her family. Pretending to be their daughter, Lilith kills the family dog when it is \\"mean\\" towards her and snaps the grandfather's neck after he seeks help from neighbors. As Bobby blesses a waterline running to the sprinklers of the family's home, Sam and Dean dispatch some of the demons who have taken over the neighborhood. Ruby appears and angrily confronts them, but is stopped short by an oncoming horde of demons. The three of them run into the house as Bobby activates the sprinklers, creating a barrier of holy water. While Dean takes the girl's father to safety in the basement, Sam and Ruby go upstairs and split up in search of Lilith. Sam finds the possessed girl in her bedroom, and although initially hesitant he prepares to strike until he is stopped by Dean, who reveals that Lilith has left her. As midnight approaches, they take the rest of the family into the basement. Sam begs Ruby to teach him how to use his abilities, but she tells him that it is too late. Dean accepts his fate as the clock strikes midnight, but runs from the approaching hellhound. The three barricade themselves inside a room, but Dean quickly realizes that Lilith has taken over Ruby's host. Claiming to have sent Ruby \\"far, far away\\", Lilith telekinetically pins the brothers down and lets in the hellhound. As Dean is mauled to death, Lilith blasts Sam with white energy from her hand. Horrified to see that it has no effect, she flees her host before Sam can retaliate. A devastated Sam cradles Dean, whose soul is then shown in Hell hanging from a vast landscape of chains and meathooks while fruitlessly screaming for Sam to help. Production =Casting= \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" marked the final appearance of Katie Cassidy as the demon Ruby. Dismissed for budgetary reasons, the actress was replaced by Genevieve Cortese for the fourth season. The writers intended Samantha Ferris to return as hunter Ellen Harvelle, a guest stint Ferris believed would have ended in her character's demise. She ultimately declined the offer because it \\"could cost [her] money and work\\". Following the mythological Lilith's role of \\"destroyer of children\\", the demon takes on a child host portrayed by Sierra McCormick. Series writer Sera Gamble commented that it was an \\"interesting\\" choice because it presented Lilith as \\"creepy and kind of molesty\\".Knight, p. 99 =Writing= Originally entitled \\"No Quarter\\", the episode was written by series creator Eric Kripke. Much of the storyline served as a homage to the Twilight Zone episode \\"It's a Good Life\\", in which a powerful child terrorizes his town.Knight, p. 97 Although Kripke found it difficult to write many of the episode's scenes, the terrorizing sequences \\"just came right out\\" because they were \\"just so fun\\".Knight, pp. 97‚Äì98 The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean from Hell, possibly even before \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\", by giving in to his demonic powers and becoming \\"this fully operational dark force\\" who would then want to go after Lilith. The battle would have been \\"much more climactic\\", with the Winchesters \\"going to war to save Dean's life\\". By the middle of the season, however, the writers realized the costs associated with depicting such an engagement and scaled it down. To make matters worse, the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented them from fleshing out Sam's evolving abilities throughout the season, and his entire story arc was pushed back into the fourth season. With Sam's storyline no longer dovetailing with Dean's, the writers \\"[never had] any doubt in [their] minds\\" to send Dean to Hell. Kripke disliked that the second-season finale \\"just ended\\", and he felt that this episode provided a cliffhanger ending that had people \\"biting their nails\\".Knight, p. 95 Although the viewers' expectations that Dean would be saved was \\"reason enough\\", his imprisonment in Hell also served as a \\"turning point\\" for both the character and the series. Kripke commented, \\"You need huge moves to happen that can cause radical shifts in the characters, that set them off in a new direction. So what happens to Dean in Hell and how Dean gets out become primary concerns of season four.\\" =Hell= The episode's final moments linger on Dean \\"meat-hooked in the center of what looks like a thousand mile spiderweb of rusty chains\\", a scene Kripke described as \\"M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser\\". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a \\"really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks\\". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him.Knight, p. 100 Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present \\"one epic glimpse\\" of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals.Knight, p. 101 Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of \\"chains and people being ripped apart\\", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it \\"a little more mysterious and dark\\". He commented, \\"My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment.\\" In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the \\"waiting room\\"‚Äîthe place \\"they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet\\"‚Äîa far cry from what he will experience \\"once he gets into the first chamber of Hell\\". The sequence was miserable for Ackles, who spent four hours in make-up having the various hooks and other prosthetics applied. Wired cuffs around his wrists and ankles, as well as a harness around his waist, were used to lift him 13 feet into the air in front of a green screen. To his discomfort, the harness slipped, causing its buckle to continuously dig into his hip throughout the scene's three or four takes. The actor, who \\"had tears rolling down [his] face\\" as he was lowered down,Knight, p. 103 deemed it the most physical pain he has endured for a single shot.Knight, p. 102 The visual effects department also found it quite a challenge, often referring to the ten-day process as the \\"Hell Shot\\".Knight, pp. 101‚Äì102 Initially planned as 12‚Äì13 seconds, the shot ended up running 35 seconds, a huge feat to render on high-definition film. They were also required to digitally remove the wires attached to Ackles, and add in chains. Lightning strikes occur throughout the scene, based on practical lightning effects done during the shoot to meet Manners' and cinematographer Serge Ladouceur's demands. This \\"[slaved the department] into the frequency of the lightning\\", forcing them to \\"reverse-engineer the randomness\\". Because of the vast complications and expenses in presenting Hell to such an extent, future representations are restricted to \\"very tight angles\\". =Filming= Principal photography took place in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from inside one of the houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside the house in the same scene made use of one of the basements.Knight, pp. 99‚Äì100 =Music= The episode's synthesized orchestral score was written by Jay Gruska, who especially enjoyed working on the episode due to his friendship with an actor from \\"It's a Good Life\\".Knight, p. 98 The music, however, was not influenced by The Twilight Zone, as Gruska prefers to base his scores on an episode's visuals. The terrorizing scenes thus featured child sounds such as the high register of a toy piano, which used a \\"low approach underneath it\\" to make it \\"absolutely sinister\\". In addition to the score, the episode followed the series tradition of a rock soundtrack. On their drive to New Harmony, Sam and Dean sing along to Bon Jovi's \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\". To mask Ackles' \\"very impressive singing voice\\", Kripke asked the actor to sing off-key. Reception Ackles (left) and Padalecki (right) for their performances as Dean and Sam Winchester. On its initial broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.998 million viewers. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of \\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\\". BuddyTV's Don Williams deemed the finale \\"absolutely fantastic\\", and ranked it tenth on his list of the top Supernatural episodes of the first three seasons. Although he \\"respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [Dean's] deal\\"‚Äîthe ending was a \\"complete jaw-dropper\\"‚Äîhe pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as \\"creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome\\", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale \\"Devil's Trap\\". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki \\"totally stepped up to the plate and knocked one out of the park\\", and Ackles was \\"nine kinds of awesome\\". On the latter, Charles noted, \\"From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all.\\" McCormick was described as \\"creepy\\", leading to Charles' \\"huge compliment\\" of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the \\"totally unexpected\\" Bon Jovi sing-along \\"totally rocked\\" and has \\"instantly become a classic\\". Her main disappointment with the episode, however, was the lack of Sam \\"going dark side\\". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the episode as one of the \\"gems\\" of the third season, and believed it likely to end up as one of her \\"Favorite 'Supernatural' Episodes of All Time\\". The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson agreed, giving the episode a grade of A-. Although it \\"got off to a shaky start with some weirdly paced scenes\\", it ended up a \\"finale that wrapped us in sticky threads of old fears, mind-bending new business and one awesome Bon Jovi song\\".

Moyaliffe Castle While this was a Butler castle, it was in the possession of the O'Dwyer clan by 1654 as evidenced by the Civil Survey of that year. While the Butlers had been in occupation, it had been under constant attack by the O'Dwyers and their neighbours, the Ryans. An record of 1500 AD records that Sir Pierce Butler was in possession of the castle and lands of Moyaliffe when a serious territorial quarrel broke out with Turlough O'Brien of the O'Brien dynasty of Thomond, (with whom the O'Dwyers were traditionally allied). The fight reached its climax when Moyaliffe Castle was surrounded by the O'Briens. The Butlers immediately sent reinforcements from their main stronghold of Kilkenny under the leadership of Robert Shea, to relieve their besieged brethren.

Jonathan D. Glater, \\"Joseph H. Flom, Pioneering Deal Lawyer, Dies at 87\\", The New York Times, Feb. 23, 2011. By the 1980s, he had acquired a reputation of being \\"Mr. Takeover\\" (whereas Martin Lipton was known as \\"Mr. Defense\\"). Flom became a partner at what is now known as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in 1954, and helped transform it from a four-lawyer firm into one of the largest law firms in the United States. In 1999, The American Lawyer named him one of their \\"Lawyers of the Century\\".The Lawyers of the Century: The American Lawyer Names Thurgood Marshall, Richard Posner, Ralph Nader, Ruth Bader Ginsberg to Its List  Early life  Flom was born in Baltimore, Maryland on December 21, 1923, the son of Itzak (Isadore) Flom, a labor organizer in the Garment District, Manhattan, and the former Fannie Fishman. Both parents were Jewish immigrants from a shtetl in the Ukraine, and‚Äîalthough they were already married‚Äîcame to United States separately, shortly after World War I. Three years after Joe Flom was born in Baltimore, the family moved to Borough Park, Brooklyn, New York City, where Joseph Flom grew up.  Education  After graduating from Townsend Harris High School, Flom worked as an office boy in a law firm during the day, while attending City College of New York on a pre-law major at night. Two years into his studies, World War II broke out and Flom was drafted into the Army. However, he never saw any fighting, as he was part of a group of 20 soldiers that were sent to a radar repair school. After the war ended, despite not having graduated from college, he enrolled at Harvard Law School on the G.I. Bill, where he was classmates with Charlie Munger and graduated in 1948.  Career  After law school, Flom joined a law firm run by Marshall Skadden, Leslie Arps, and John Slate. He eventually became a partner in 1954, effectively taking over leadership of the firm a couple years later. By the time of Flom's death, Skadden Arps was one of the largest and most profitable law firms in the world. Flom was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch as chairman of the New York City Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution in 1987, a post he held till the commission completed its work, issued its report, and was dissolved in early 1990. The commission's efforts included an extensive civic-education campaign and the creation of a celebratory re-enactment on 30 April 1989 of the inauguration of George Washington as the first president of the United States. Malcolm Gladwell devoted a chapter to Flom in his book Outliers, crediting him with building out and diversifying the firm and anticipating the rise of mergers and acquisitions as a specialty. \\"For 20 years, he perfected his craft at Skadden,\\" Gladwell wrote. \\"Then the world changed and he was ready.\\" Flom was also mentioned in Jeffrey Madrick's book Age of Greed for his contribution to the world of hostile takeovers in the American economy. Madrick wrote, \\"his interest in the takeover gave his firm the lifeline they needed to survive.\\"  Personal  On February 23, 2011, Flom died in New York City from heart failure. His wife, Judi Sorensen Flom, also an attorney, was at his side. He has two children: Jason Flom, a music executive and advocate of prison reform and Peter, a statistician and an advocate for people with learning disabilities.

Today the Tax Collector's main office is in the building.Pensapedia: Escambia County Tax Collector History =F. C. Brent's tenure= In 1892, Francis Celestino Brent purchased a controlling interest of the Sullivans' bank and merged it with his own bank, keeping the First National Bank name. As the bank's operations and assets grew, Brent planned a nine-story office tower that would house both the bank and other businesses. However, with the construction of the Brent and Blount Buildings after the Halloween Night Fire of 1905, the need for office space was greatly reduced and the tower plans were scrapped. At this time, due to the demands of his other interests, Brent retired as president of the bank, passing control to his longtime officer, William H. Knowles. =Failure= On February 1, 1914, the Liverpool-based firm Crow, Rudolf & Company, which managed much of Pensacola's timber exports and in which the First National Bank had invested nearly a half million dollars, announced it could not meet its debts. Soon thereafter a federal receiver named R. W. Goodhart was sent to audit the bank. Despite having more than $400,000 on-site in its vault, the First National Bank was ordered to close. =Other history= The First National Bank Building In 1906, Knowles arranged the construction of another building on South Palafox Street. The First National Bank Building, built in neo-Grecian style with rows of Ionic white marble columns, was completed on May 23, 1908. Knowles sold his interest in 1909, and William K. Hyer, Jr. became president. Control changed hands again two years later, with Brent and Knowles coming out of retirement to become president and vice-president, respectively. A report released on December 1, 1912 stated the bank's earnings since its establishment in 1880 at $1,114,671.

He played as a left winger in England and later South Africa. He briefly returned to England as a coach, but then emigrated to Australia, where he spent the remainder of his life. Career Born in Bushey, Bunce grew up in the local area, representing Hertfordshire as a schoolboy. He joined Watford as an amateur in September 1955, turning professional later in the year. His first competitive appearance came on 22 October 1955, in a 2‚Äì0 Football League Third Division South defeat at Southampton. Bunce's first goal came three days later, in a Southern Floodlit Cup fixture against Aldershot Town, and his first Football League goal on 29 October against Shrewsbury Town. Despite this early form, Bunce's appearances in his first three seasons at Watford were limited; he made twelve in 1955‚Äì56, two in 1956‚Äì57, and none in 1957‚Äì58. Nonetheless, during this period Bunce became the first Watford player to play for England at youth level since Fred Fayers in 1910. Bunce established himself as a frequent member of the first team squad in 1958‚Äì59, making 26 appearances in all competitions. He followed this up with 32 appearances in 1959‚Äì60, as Watford secured promotion from the Fourth Division. After missing the first three games of the following season, Bunce scored his first career hat-trick, in a 6‚Äì1 win over Brentford at Vicarage Road on 30 August 1960. He played in all of Watford's remaining league games, finishing the season with 16 goals from 43 appearances. The club finished the season in 4th position, at the time their highest ever Football League placing. He followed this up with 11 goals from 51 appearances in 1961‚Äì62. After making seven appearances in the first four months of the following season, Bunce transferred to Cambridge United, and shortly afterwards also played for their rivals, Cambridge City. Bunce emigrated to South Africa in February 1964, joining Highlands Park. His one season there was successful, as the club won the National Football League. He then spent two years at Germiston Callies, before returning to England to coach Bedford Town in 1967. By 1969 he had emigrated to Australia, where he played for Whilmena and Ringwood. He remained in the country after his retirement as a player, coaching youth players. Bunce died on 9 October 1991, aged 53.

They are named after the American mathematician Hassler Whitney. Construction Let M and N be two real, smooth manifolds. Furthermore, let C‚àû(M,N) denote the space of smooth mappings between M and N. The notation C‚àû means that the mappings are infinitely differentiable, i.e. partial derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous. =Whitney Ck-topology= For some integer , let Jk(M,N) denote the k-jet space of mappings between M and N. The jet space can be endowed with a smooth structure (i.e. a structure as a C‚àû manifold) which make it into a topological space. This topology is used to define a topology on C‚àû(M,N). For a fixed integer consider an open subset and denote by Sk(U) the following: : S^k(U) = \\\\\\\\{ f \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(M,N) : (J^kf)(M) \\\\subseteq U \\\\\\\\} .

Let us denote by Wk the set of open subsets of C‚àû(M,N) with respect to the Whitney Ck-topology. Then the Whitney C‚àû-topology is defined to be the topology whose basis is given by W, where: : W = \\\\bigcup_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} W^k .

It was built as \\"Nelson Place\\" in the early 19th century, and the suffix \\"West\\" was added to avoid confusion with Nelson Place East on the other side of the city. The end houses (Nos. 1 and 9) have Ionic pilasters and there is a wrought iron balcony on the second floor of Nos. 2‚Äì8. These features match the adjacent Norfolk Crescent, which was built as part of the same urban development. On the western end of the Georgian terrace there is a 1970s block of flats called Nelson House and further down the street (to the west) there is a row of Victorian houses called Nelson Villas. History =Original design (c. 1792-c. 1817)= A drawing of the intended facade for Nelson Place, dated 1807. Nelson Place, which was named after Admiral Nelson, was part of a larger development that also included Nile Street (named after the Battle of the Nile, one of Nelson's victories) and Norfolk Crescent (the centrepiece of the development, named after Nelson's home county). The architect who designed the matching facades of Nelson Place and Norfolk Crescent was probably John Palmer. Palmer's design for Nelson Place was a terrace of 23 houses, each 3 windows wide. The two end houses were to have ionic pilasters and the central houses were to have a pediment, identical to the facade of Norfolk Crescent. The terrace was to be completely level, but the ground slopes down towards the river (at the west end of the row) so the street would have been built up on vaults, as at the south end of Norfolk Crescent. Each house was five storeys high (basement, ground floor, piano nobile, second floor and attic). Unlike many other Bath houses, the attic windows are in the main facade, not in the roof. This makes the building look taller and more impressive. The first two houses (Nos. 1 and 2) were built in the early 19th century and completed c. 1817 but a financial crisis (resulting from the Bath Bank crash in 1793) meant that Bath developers were struggling to raise money for new houses. =Reduced design (c. 1820-c. 1835)= No. 2 (left) and No. 5 (right) Nelson Place, showing the reduction in width from Palmer's design (left) to Pinch's design (right). Nos. 1 and 2 Nelson Place were first leased c. 1817,Rate books for 1810 to 1820 at Bath Record Office show these houses are occupied from 1817. but it was no easy task to raise funds for the other planned 21 houses in the terrace. As a result, it was decided that the terrace could be continued with smaller houses. The new design, probably the work of John Pinch the elder, had houses that were 2 windows wide, to attract middle class rather than upper class occupants. The ground floor window (which is larger than the others) and the door are offset from the upper windows. Pinch designed very similar terraces elsewhere in Bath, such as Raby Place (Bathwick Hill). Four houses (Nos. 3‚Äì6) were built in this style and completed c. 1827Rate books for 1827 at Bath Record Office show some of these houses to be occupied. and a further two houses (Nos. 7 and 8) were built slightly later and completed c. 1835.Rate books for 1827 to 1835 at Bath Record Office. By this time the demand for town houses was dropping and no more houses were built in Nelson Place. =Nelson Villas (19th century)= The Georgian terrace was left uncompleted and in the second half of the 19th century a row of Victorian terraced houses called Nelson Villas was built at the west end of the street. These houses, two storeys high with front gardens, are very different to the Georgian terrace with its tall imposing facade. =Nelson House and No. 9 (c. 1973)= Palmer's plan for Nelson Place (top) compared with the terrace that exists today (bottom). In the 1970s a modern block of flats (Nelson House) was built in the gap between the Georgian and Victorian terraces. As part of this block of flats a single house (No. 9) was added to the end of Nelson Place, with a facade matching No. 1. This pilastered end house lends the Georgian terrace visual symmetry and gives the false impression that the truncated Georgian terrace was the intended final form of the street. Today Nos. 1 and 2 have been combined into a single house, which contains flats. The door to No. 1, which faced onto Nile Street, has been replaced with a window and the staircase inside No. 1 has been removed, so the flats in both houses are accessed via the door and staircase of No. 2. Nos. 3 and 4 have also been combined for conversion into flats, the door and staircase of No. 3 having been removed. The outline of the old doorways to No. 1 and No. 3 can still be made out.Letter to Bath & North East Somerset Council re: Planning Application for St Georges Place, available at bathnes.gov.uk Notable residents In 1839 Sir Isaac Pitman, the inventor of shorthand, moved into No. 5 Nelson Place West. He set up a printing press there and used the house for his phonetic institute. In 1851 he moved to a larger house elsewhere in Bath. In 1859, he moved his printing press to a factory on Lower Bristol Road, not far from Nelson Place. The company he set up, called LIBERfabrica is still located on these premises. Vice-Admiral Henry Gordon (d.1856) lived at No. 1 Nelson Place from 1829 until his death in 1856. Gordon was present at the Glorious First of June naval battle and (as a lieutenant) he was in command of HMS Wolverine when she was captured by the French in 1804.

It was active in the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil during the 1940s. Refusing to believe the news of Japan's surrender at the end of World War II, some of its most fanatic members used violence against those who did surrender. Shindo Renmei killed at least 23 people, all of whom were Japanese- Brazilians, and wounded 147 others. Background The first Japanese emigrated to Brazil in 1908 with the intention of amassing wealth and returning to Japan. They found themselves in a completely different country, with different languages, religions, climate, food, and customs. Consequently, they lived in relative isolation from the culture around them and few learned Portuguese. They were generally viewed with suspicion by the populace as a result. By the 1930s, Brazil had the largest community of Japanese immigrants in the world. The Estado Novo regime established by Get√∫lio Vargas, aiming to promote Brazilian nationalism, repressed the Japanese Brazilians, Italian Brazilians and German Brazilians. The decree 383 of April 18, 1938 mandated that foreigners were not allowed to take part in political activities or speak foreign languages in public. Additionally, the first language taught to children had to be Portuguese. Radio broadcast in foreign languages was also forbidden. Publishing in foreign languages was only allowed in bilingual editions. At the time, almost 90% of the Japanese immigrants were subscribers of Japanese language newspapers, which indicates a much higher literacy rate than the general populace at the time. Decree 383, which made bilingual editions obligatory, in effect required such newspapers to stop printing due to the resulting high costs. As a significant number of Japanese immigrants could not understand Portuguese, it became exceedingly difficult for them to obtain any extra-communal information. When Brazil sided with the Allies in 1942, all communication with Japan was cut off and the entry of new Japanese immigrants was forbidden. Letters from Japan would no longer arrive to their recipients. Japanese-Brazilians were unable to travel freely or live in certain regions, such as coastal areas, without safe conduct from the authorities. Radio receivers were also confiscated, making it almost impossible for Japanese-Brazilians to listen to shortwave transmissions from Japan. Even bilingual newspapers were prohibited during this period. Foundation Shindo Renmei was not the only, nor the first, political organization founded by Japanese-Brazilians. Most of these organizations provided mutual support for the community. None of them, except for Shindo Renmei, was ever involved in terrorism. The Japanese Catholics, Keizo Ishihara, Margarida Watanabe, and Massaru Takahashi founded the Pia (\\"pious\\"), a charity created with the approval of the church and the Brazilian government to help the poorer members of the diaspora. A former Japanese army colonel, Junji Kikawa, was active in the Pia. In 1942, after a violent altercation between Japanese and Brazilians in Mar√≠lia, Kikawa founded Shindo Renmei, and campaigned for the Japanese community to commit acts of sabotage. He distributed pamphlets urging Japanese-Brazilian farmers to cease producing silk (used at time to make parachutes) and peppermint (menthol was used in the production of explosives). As Pia's directors opposed this campaign, Kikawa left Pia in 1944. Shindo Renmei had its headquarters in S√£o Paulo, with 64 local offices in the states of S√£o Paulo and Paran√°. It was sponsored by donations from its affiliates. With the end of World War II, Shindo Renmei refused to believe the official news of Japan's defeat. Believing it to be nothing but American propaganda, Shindo Renmei's members established new goals: to punish the defeatists, to declare that Japan had won or was winning the war, and defend the emperor's honor. In Shindo Renmei's eyes, the Japanese-Brazilian community was divided in two groups: * Kachigumi, or \\"the victorious\\", who believed the war was still going on, or that Japan had won. They were the majority mostly from the poorer members of the community and those who still intended to return to Japan. * Makegumi, or \\"the defeated\\" pejoratively called \\"dirty hearts\\", who had accepted the news of Japan's defeat. They were usually the wealthier members of the community who were more informed and better adapted to Brazilian society. Compounding the confusion, a number of deceivers produced fake Japanese newspapers and magazines with news stories about the \\"great victory\\" and started selling land in the \\"conquered territories\\". Others sold yen, the Japanese currency nearly worthless at the time, to those who intended to return to Japan. This drove many Kachigumis into bankruptcy and even to suicide in some cases.Gargantas Cortadas in Isto√â Online (visitada em 17 de agosto de 2008) Terrorist actions Shindo Renmei's members believed that the news regarding Japan's defeat was false, and they created a communication system to spread to declare that Japan had actually won. Underground Japanese-language newspapers and magazines were published and secret radio stations were established to push this view. The group also wrote lists with the names of makegumis who should die for betraying the emperor. Kamegoro Ogasawara, owner of a dry cleaner in S√£o Paulo, coordinated the punitive actions. Many Japanese-owned boarding houses served as hideouts for the killers after their actions. Shindo Renmei's killers, or tokkotai, were always young people. They sent letters to their intended targets before a murder, urging them to commit seppuku ‚Äì ritual suicide by sword ‚Äì so that they could \\"regain their lost honor\\". The letters started by saying: \\"You have a dirty heart, so you must have the throat washed\\", this essentially means to be cut by a katana. Not one of those who received such a letter complied with the request. Thus, they were killed with firearms or katanas. From 1946 to early 1947, Shindo Renmei killed 23 and wounded 147 Japanese-Brazilians, according to official data. The killers often surrendered to the police soon after their crimes, explaining that they had nothing against Brazil or its people, and that they were not common criminals, for they killed only as part of their duty. Repression and end Tales of murder, especially by katana sword, spread fear among Japanese-Brazilians. The general Brazilian population was not directly affected, however, it was left with the impression that all Japanese were nationalist fanatics. Bursts of violence against Japanese immigrants, belonging to Shindo Renmei or not, occurred mostly in towns on the countryside where they had large communities, such as in the region of Tup√£, S√£o Paulo. After two attacks by Shindo Renmei and the murder of a Brazilian truck driver by a Japanese truck driver on 31 July 1946, a massive crowd in Osvaldo Cruz rioted and was willing to lynch any Japanese they found. The riot was contained only with the arrival of army troops.SUZUKI Jr, Matinas. Hist√≥ria da discrimina√ß√£o brasileira contra os japoneses sai do limbo in Folha de S.Paulo, 20 de abril de 2008 The army and the (DEOPS - State Department of Political and Social Order) investigated the case in the states of S√£o Paulo and Paran√°. According to the police of S√£o Paulo, 31,380 Japanese-Brazilians were suspected of having connections to the organization. DEOPS also investigated 376 Japanese-Brazilians. Ultimately, the leaders of Shindo Renmei and most of the tokkotai were arrested. About 155 Japanese immigrants were to be banished from Brazil in 1946, but this never happened, and the time for punishment elapsed. Only 14 tokkotai were convicted of murder. After many decades, Shindo Renmei is still somewhat of a taboo among Japanese-Brazilian immigrants.

Geography Residence and St Lawrence Church Located within the former Duchy of Swabia, the princely abbey was the second largest ecclesiastical principality of the Swabian Circle by area, after the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg. It stretched along the Iller River in the Allg√§u region, from Waltenhofen (Martinszell) in the south to Legau and Gr√∂nenbach in the northwest, and up to Ronsberg and Unterthingau in the east. The Imperial city of Kempten itself formed a self- ruling city its own right, enclaved within the abbey's territory. The Princely Abbey of Kempten covered approximately and included some 85 villages and hundreds of hamlets and farms. At the time of its annexation to Bavaria in 1802, it had some 42,000 subjects.http://www.historisches-lexikon- bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45400 History According to the 11th-century chronicles by Hermann of Reichenau, the monastery of Kempten dedicated to Virgin Mary and Gordianus and Epimachus was established around 752 under its first abbot Audogar. According to other sources, it was however erected by two Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Saint Gall, Magnus of F√ºssen and Theodor, who also founded the St Mang's Monastery in F√ºssen. Audogar, first abbot of Kempten The abbey had financial and political support from the ruling Carolingian dynasty, mainly from Hildegard of Vinzgouw, the second wife of Charlemagne, and her son Louis the Pious. It soon became one of the more prominent monasteries in the Carolingian Empire. It was rebuilt in 941 by the abbot Ulrich of Augsburg after Magyar raids. =Imperial Status= The status of Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit) was confirmed by King Henry IV of Germany in 1062. The Kempten abbots assumed the title of a Prince-abbot (F√ºrstabt) in the 12th century. In 1213 the Hohenstaufen king Frederick II of Germany vested them with comital privileges in the abbey's territory and in 1218 also ceded the rights of a secular Vogt protector, confirmed by his son King Henry VII in 1224. Several attempts under their successors Conrad IV and Rudolph I to regain the secular lordship ultimately failed. The abbey's development of an Imperial estate was accomplished with the bestowing of a single vote in the Imperial Diet in 1548. By a privilege granted by King Rudolph I, the town of Kempten had freed itself from the authority of the abbot and became a Free imperial city, starting a long rivalry. When during the German Peasants' War in 1525 the Kempten Prince-abbot had to seek shelter within the city walls, he was forced to sell his last property rights inside the imperial city in the so-called ‚ÄúGreat Purchase‚Äù, marking the start of a tense co-existence of two independent estates bearing the same name next to each other. =Thirty Years' War= Abbey complex More conflict arose after the Imperial city of Kempten from 1527 onwards converted to Protestantism in direct opposition to the Catholic monastery. The citizens signed the 1529 Protestation at Speyer and the 1530 Augsburg Confession. In turn, Kempten Abbey joined the Catholic League in 1609. During the Thirty Years' War, the monastery buildings were burnt to the ground by Swedish troops in 1632. From 1651, the Kempten Prince-abbot Roman Giel of Gielsberg commissioned a princely residence and the new abbey church St. Lorenz Basilica, one of the first major churches to be built after the war in Germany. Still in 1706, Kempten was the center of a religious controversy, when the abbot confiscated a Reformed church, which provoked King Frederick I of Prussia to confiscate all Benedictine properties until the church was returned. =Secularisation= Honorius Roth von Schreckenstein, Prince-Abbot of Kempten (1760-1785) Emperor Charles VI granted the monastery complex town privileges in 1728, however, an autonomous municipality was not established. In 1775 the abbey ordered the last witchcraft trial in the Holy Roman Empire, when Anna Maria Schwegelin was sentenced to death by decapitation, though the verdict was not enforced. During the Napoleonic Wars the abbey's territory was occupied by Bavarian troops in 1802 and was formerly dissolved in the subsequent German mediatization (Reichsdeputationshauptschluss). The abbey's territory as well as the Imperial city of Kempten were annexed by Bavaria, in 1819 both territories were merged into a single communal entity within the Kingdom of Bavaria.

The organization was founded in 1900, in connection with the funeral of Pyotr Lavrov. The Agrarian Socialist League emerged as the most prominent of the revolutionary exile groups, as it gathered several prominent figures amongst its ranks. As the Agrarian Socialist League assembled both the older generation of Narodnik revolutionaries as well as younger Socialist- Revolutionaries, it became a key constituent in forming the Socialist- Revolutionary Party. Members of the organization included Volkhovskii, Chaikovskii, I. A. Rubanovich, Lazarev, Chaim Zhitlowsky, Shishko, D. A. Khilkov, D. A. Klements, S. M. Kliachko, Rappoport, Victor Chernov, M. R. Gots, Sletov, and Serebriakov.Hildermeier, Manfred. The Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party Before the First World War.

The Third Revolution: Popular Movements in the Revolutionary Era. London: Cassell, 1996. p. 58 During 1900‚Äì1901 the Agrarian Socialist League issued various publications: two editions (1,000 copies each) of the manifesto \\"The immediate question of the revolutionary cause\\" and five propaganda pamphlets intended to be distributed amongst peasants (\\"How the Minister takes care for the peasants\\", \\"How the Hungarian peasants are fighting for their rights\\", \\"Peasant unions in Sicily\\", \\"Sketches from Russian history\\", and \\"Conversations about the land\\", each between 1,000 and 2,000 copies). This literature was well received in Russia (particularly amongst a group of Socialist-Revolutionary intellectuals in Saratov), but smuggling the texts into the country was a hazardous task. By late 1901 the organization uncovered that the comrade in charge of the smuggling efforts (N. K. Pauli) was a police infiltrator and that most of the smuggled literature had been seized at the border.Perrie, Maureen.

Traditional sour beer styles include Belgian lambics, gueuze and Flanders red ale, and German gose. Brewing Unlike modern brewing, which is done in a sanitary environment to guard against the intrusion of wild yeast, historically the starter used from one batch to another usually contained some wild yeast and bacteria. Sour beers are made by intentionally allowing wild yeast strains or bacteria into the brew, traditionally through the barrels or during the cooling of the wort in a coolship open to the outside air. The most common microbes used to intentionally sour beer are bacteria Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, while Brettanomyces can also add some acidity. Another method for achieving a tart flavor is adding fruit, which directly contributes organic acids such as citric acid. Additionally, acid can be directly added to beer or added by the use of excessive amounts of acidulated malt. Depending on the process employed, the uncertainty involved in using wild yeast may cause the beer to take months to ferment and potentially years to mature. However, modern methods allow sour beer to be created within a typical timeframe for ales, several days. Breweries The Rare Barrel sours Making sour beer is a risky and specialized form of beer brewing, and longstanding breweries which produce it and other lambics often specialize in this and other Belgian-style beers. Established in 1836, one of the oldest breweries still in operation that produces sour beer is the Rodenbach Brewery of Roeselare, Belgium. Sour beer has also spread outside Belgium, to other European countries, the United States and Canada. Sour beer styles While any type of beer may be soured, most follow traditional or standardized guidelines. =American wild ale= Beers brewed in the United States utilizing yeast and bacteria strains instead of or in addition to standard brewers yeasts. These microflora may be cultured or acquired spontaneously, and the beer may be fermented in a number of different types of brewing vessels. American wild ales tend not to have specific parameters or guidelines stylistically, but instead simply refer to the use of unusual yeasts. =Berliner Weisse= At one time the most popular alcoholic beverage in Berlin, this is a somewhat weaker (usually around 3% abv) beer made sour by use of Lactobacillus bacteria. This type of beer is usually served with flavored syrups to balance the tart flavor.The World Guide to Beer, Michael Jackson, Mitchell Beazley, =Flanders red ale= Flanders red ales are fermented with brewers yeast, then placed into oak barrels to age and mature. Usually, the mature beer is blended with younger beer to adjust the taste for consistency. This is also sometimes referred to as \\"flemish red\\". =Gose= Gose is a top-fermenting beer that originated in Goslar, Germany. This style is characterized by the use of coriander and salt and is made sour by inoculating the wort with lactic acid bacteria before primary fermentation. =Lambic= Lambic is a spontaneously-fermented beer made in the Pajottenland region around Brussels, Belgium. Wort is left to cool overnight in the koelschip where it is exposed to the open air during the winter and spring, and placed into barrels to ferment and mature. Most lambics are blends of several season's batches, such as gueuze, or are secondarily fermented with fruits, such as kriek and framboise. As such, pure unblended lambic is quite rare, and few bottled examples exist. =Oud bruin= Originating from the Flemish region of Belgium, oud bruins are differentiated from the Flanders red ale in that they are darker in color and not aged on wood. As such this style tends to use cultured yeasts to impart its sour notes.

Islamic fiction is different than Muslim fiction, which may refer to any and all works of fiction produced by Muslims.  Islamic fiction established  While fiction has been produced throughout the entirety of Muslim history (such as One Thousand and One Nights, the term Islamic fiction has not been used until recently. In 2005 and 2006 the Islamic Writers Alliance (IWA), a professional Muslim organization based in the US with an International membership, took on the work of defining Islamic fiction and determining the criteria to establish it as a fiction subcategory of adult and juvenile fiction. The membership then began the process of identifying published Islamic fiction books that were at that time described as Muslim authored books or children's books in the Muslim book industry. This was done because so many books were getting lost in the previously established classification methods from the BISAC system, that a need for establishing a clear and distinct classification of specialization for this style of literature was realized, and thereby action taken towards a unification of the definition. Islamic fiction defined Islamic fiction refers to creative, imaginative, non-preachy fiction books written by Muslims and marketed primarily to Muslims. Islamic fiction may be marketed to mainstream markets as well. The content of these books will likely incorporate some religious content and themes, and may include non-fictionalized historical or factual Islamic content with or without direct reference to the Qur'an or the Sunnah of Mohammed. The stories may also include modern, real life situations and moral dilemmas. Authors of Islamic fiction intend for readers to learn something positive about Islam when they read Islamic fiction stories. Islamic fiction cannot include harmful content: vulgar language, sexually explicit content, un-Islamic practices that are not identified as un- Islamic, or content that portrays Islam in a negative way. Issues which may impact Muslim evaluation of Islamic fiction story content While Islamic knowledge presented in Islamic fiction may be taken directly from the Qur'an and traditions of Muhammad, as well as from Islamic history, not all of the Islamic content in these books will be considered factual or acceptable by all Muslim readers. This is due to differences between a Muslim reader and the writers, editors, and publishers with respect to personal practices, beliefs and knowledge, as well as the influence of his school of thought, culture, and tradition. Determining the accuracy and permissibility of Islamic content is the responsibility of every adult Muslim reader. This may differ according to individual differences in school of thought and practice. All Muslim parents, guardians, teachers, and school administrators must determine whether a book's content is halal for their children and students. This Islamic Reminder holds true for all materials a Muslim reads. Emergence as a literary form Currently Islamic fiction is not recognized as a category by the Book Industry Standards and Communications (BISAC) coding system; however works from other mainstream fiction genres are found to meet the criteria. For example, Leila Abouzeid‚Äôs The Year of The Elephant (Arabic version 1983, English translation 1989), the first work written by a Moroccan woman to be translated to English, has been identified as falling into the sub-categories of being both a feminist novel, and because of its depiction of the protagonist and other characters practicing Islam, qualifying as Islamic fiction. Amongst the first wave of Islamic fiction (as defined here) written in English specifically for Muslim audiences was juvenile fiction, including the series Invincible Abdullah originally published from 1993-1995 by Aziza and Uthman Hutchinson, and the Ahmad Deen Series (1996) by Yahiya Emerick. The first two English language series of Islamic fiction novels written for teens and adults is Umm Zakiyyah‚Äôs Tamika Douglass Trilogy beginning with If I Should Speak (2001) and the Echo Series written by Jamilah Kolocotronis beginning with Echoes (2006).Ren√©e Warner Syed \\"Realistic Portrayals\\" Azizah Magazine, Volume 5 Issue 2 Kolocotronis‚Äô first Islamic fiction title, Innocent People was self- published in 2003. In 2004, Irving Karchmar published the Sufi novel, Master of the Jinn. Linda D. Delgado, prolific author of Islamic fiction in addition to other various works, began writing and publishing the award-winning Islamic Rose series in 2005, with the latest edition of this series last published in early 2012. Subgenres Works of Islamic fiction have been written in several fiction genres. Maryam \\"Umm Juwayriyah\\" Sullivan's teen/adult novel The Size of a Mustard Seed (2009) is the first known Urban Islamic fiction title.Diana \\"Urban Islamic Fiction: A New Genre in Muslim Lit\\" Muslimah Mediawatch 15 July 2002 retrieved 8 August 2010 Najiyah Diana Helwani's juvenile Islamic fiction title Sophia's Journal: Time Warp 1857 (2008) has been classified as both a historical fiction novel as well as science fiction. The seminal juvenile fiction series Invincible Abdullah and Ahmad Deen are both written in mystery styles. MuslimMatters.org, a popular multi-author Muslim blog, has published a series of genre-blending novels by Wael Abdelgawad that draw from the Islamic fiction, action, mystery and thriller categories. Short stories Some Islamic fiction shorts can be found amongst other works in mainstream or special-interest anthologies, such as collections of Arab or South Asian writers, but very few anthologies and venues exclusively feature Islamic fiction shorts and poetry. The Islamic Writers Alliance (IWA) has produced two anthology titles of Islamic fiction and poetry, Many Poetic Voices, One Faith (2008) and Many Voices, One Faith II ‚Äì Islamic Fiction Stories (2009).IWA projects IWA also produces a quarterly online magazine, IWA Magazine (formerly known as Islamic Ink) which features Islamic fiction. Another anthology, Between Love, Hope and Fear published in 2007 by An-Najm Publishers of UK, is a collection of short stories, poetry and essays written by Muslims from around the globe. The American Muslim women's magazine, Azizah, regularly features original short works of Islamic fiction and poetry. Damazine is a quarterly online literary journal which publishes Muslim-related fiction (including Islamic fiction), creative nonfiction and poetry. Awards Several Muslim organizations encourage the creation of Islamic fiction and other creative writing by hosting annual awards for Islamic literary arts. The Islamic Writers Alliance (IWA)Islamic Writers Alliance began sponsoring poetry contests for children and adults in 2005. As part of its efforts in the cause of promoting literacy with an emphasis on Islamic literature, the IWA also traditionally grants annual awards in the form of book donations to libraries of Islamic Schools.Islamic Writers Alliance Book Awards In 2009, IWA added an Islamic fiction section for teens and adults to its contest, and in 2011, it added a non-fiction Essays section which was co-sponsored by Zakat Foundation of America in association with the IWA.Islamic Writers Alliance Contests & Awards Since 2006, the Muslim Writers Awards hosts an annual Muslim Writers contest which accepts submissions for poetry, fiction, screenplay and other literary forms, including young Muslims categories. Select winners of the Muslim Writers Awards have their work published at IslamOnline. Authors of Islamic fiction Although the term \\"Islamic fiction\\" is rather new in circles of literature and Muslims alike, the art of Islamic fiction is not really so new. Muslim Narratives and the Discourse of English, a study written by Amin Malik and published by State University of New York Press, Albany, in 2005, documents that the first ever work of fiction in English language by a Muslim author was published as early as 1905. Some of these authors write Islamic fiction exclusively for children, while others direct their work to an older audience of Young Adults. Although more authors are being discovered daily as to having written and published works to come under the classification of Islamic fiction, and so no list is extensively exclusive, to view a more comprehensive listing of these authors, please refer to the external links listed in the External links section of this page. *Ahmed Ali (writer) *Jamilah Kolocotronis *Leila Aboulela *Leila Abouzeid *Samina Ali *Wael Abdelgawad *Yahiya Emerick Controversy There are conflicting views amongst Muslims as to whether reading and writing fictional stories is or is not halal (permissible) within Islam. In fiqh, although not outright considered haram (impermissible), ‚Äúabandoning busying oneself with [fiction stories] is preferable‚Äù and fiction stories are seen as a frivolous way for a Muslim to use their time. Another interpretation is that fictional stories are permissible and even encouraged for purposes of dawah, to help people to learn about Islam, as long as the author has made clear that the story is not true. As well, the writing should be in the style of Islamic fiction.

It opposed the autocratic rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the militancy of the Razakars.HSC was formed in 1938. Background Although technically outside British India, Hyderabad State was closely allied with the British government, with its Nizam having the title of the \\"Most Faithful Ally of the British Government.\\" The Nizam gave patronage to the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, a party dedicated to preserving Islamic rule in the state, and allowed its militant wing, the Razakars, to operate freely. Its leaders Bahadur Yar Jung and Qasim Razvi became close advisers to the Nizam. Up to 1920, there was no political organisation of any kind in Hyderabad. In that year, following British pressure, the Nizam issued a firman appointing a special officer to investigate constitutional reforms. It was welcomed enthusiastically by a section of the populace, who formed the Hyderabad State Reforms Association. However, the Nizam and the Special Officer ignored all their demands for consultation. An organisation called Andhra Jana Sangham (later renamed Andhra Mahasabha) was formed in November 1921, and focused on educating the masses of Telangana in political awareness. With leading members such as Madapati Hanumantha Rao, Burgula Ramakrishna Rao and M. Narsing Rao, its activities included urging merchants to resist offering freebies to government officials and encouraging labourers to resist the system of begar (free labour requested at the behest of state). Alarmed by its activities, the Nizam passed a powerful gagging order in 1929, requiring all public meetings to obtain prior permission. But the organisation persisted by mobilising on social issues such as the protection of ryots, women's rights, abolition of the devadasi system and purdah, uplifting of Dalits etc. The Andhra Mahasabha's move towards politics also inspired similar movements in Marathwada and Karnataka in 1937, giving rise to the Maharashtra Parishad and Karnataka Parishad respectively. Following the Government of India Act 1935, British India introduced major constitutional reforms, with a loose federal structure for India and provincial autonomy. In the provincial elections of February 1937, the Indian National Congress emerged with clear majority in most provinces of British India and formed provincial governments. The Andhra Mahasabha passed a resolution in favour of responsible government and the parallel organisations of Maharastrha Parishad and Karnataka Parishad were formed in their respective regions. The Nizam appointed a fresh Constitutional Reforms Committee in September 1937. However, the gagging orders of the 1920s remained curtailing the freedom of press and restrictions on public speeches and meetings. In response, a 'Hyderabad People's Convention' was created, with a working committee of 23 leading Hindus and 5 Muslims. The convention ratified a report, which was submitted to the Constitutional Reforms Committee in January 1938. However, four of the five Muslim members of the working committee refused to sign the report, reducing its potential impact. Formation and Satyagraha In February 1938, the Indian National Congress passed the Haripura resolution declaring that the princely states are \\"an integral part of India,\\" and that it stood for \\"the same political, social and economic freedom in the States as in the rest of India.\\" Encouraged by this, the standing committee of the People's Convention proposed to form a Hyderabad State Congress and an enthusiastic drive to enrol members was begun. By July 1938, the committee claimed to have enrolled 1200 primary members and declared that elections would soon be held for the office- bearers. It called upon both Hindus and Muslims of the state to \\"shed mutual distrust\\" and join the \\"cause of responsible government under the aegis of the Ashaf Jahi dynasty.\\" The Nizam responded by passing a new Public Safety Act on 6 September 1938, three days before the scheduled elections, and issued an order that the Hyderabad State Congress would be deemed unlawful. Negotiations with the Nizam's government to lift the ban ended in failure. The Hyderabad issue was widely discussed in the newspapers in British India. P. M. Bapat, a leader of the Indian National Congress from Pune, declared that he would launch a satyagraha (civil disobedience movement) in Hyderabad. The Arya Samaj leaders hoped to capitalise on the communal tensions that had been on the boil since early 1938. Perhaps in a bid not to be outdone, the activists of the Hyderabad State Congress formed a 'Committee of Action' and initiated a satyagraha on 24 October 1938. Members of the organisation were fielded, who openly declared they belonged to the Hyderabad State Congress and courted arrest. The Arya Samaj-Hindu Mahasabha combine also launched their own satyagraha on the same day. The Indian National Congress refused to back the satyagraha of the State Congress. The Haripura resolution had in fact been a compromise between the moderates and the radicals. Gandhi had been wary of direct involvement in the states lest the agitations degenerate into violence. The Congress high command was also keen on a firmer collaboration between Hindus and Muslims, which the State Congress lacked. Padmaja Naidu wrote a lengthy report to Gandhi where she castigated the State Congress for lacking unity and cohesion and for being 'communal in [her] sense of the word'. On 24 December, the State Congress suspended the agitation after 300 activists had courted arrest. The response from the state's Hindus was lacklustre. Eventually, the Nizam government reached a compromise with the Hindu organisations, setting up a Religious Affairs Committee and announcing constitutional reforms by 20 July. Subsequently, the Hindu organisations suspended their campaigns and all their imprisoned activists were released. However, the Hyderabad State Congress continued to be banned till 1946 and its jailed activists remained behind bars. Activity in 1940s In 1942, the leaders of the Hyderabad Congress launched a non-violent campaign of civil disobedience, a satyagraha, for civil rights, representative democracy alongside the Quit India movement led by the Indian National Congress. The Nizam's government finally ended the ban on the State Congress in April, 1946 after the end of the Quit India struggle in British India and the beginning of the process of granting independence to India from British rule. Union with India The Hyderabad State Congress began actively campaigning for the state of Hyderabad to join the Union of India upon independence, which the Nizam was resisting. The State Congress called for 7 August 1947 to be observed as \\"Join Indian Union\\" Day. Protests, strikes and flag-hoisting broke out across the state, and the Nizam's government banned the Congress again and conducted mass arrests. The Razakars in turn threatened to mass pogroms against Hindu civilians in Hyderabad and provoke violence across India. The crisis continued until September, 1948 when the Indian government unfortunately authorized the Indian Army to annex Hyderabad that led to massacre of many civilians.

The concept notably appears as a key characteristic of market socialism, where it takes the form of a dividend payment to each citizen derived from the property income generated by publicly owned enterprises, representing the individual‚Äôs share of the capital and natural resources owned by society.The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism, by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: \\"The term ‚Äòsocial dividend‚Äô was introduced in 1936 by Oskar Lange in his milestone essay ‚ÄòOn the Economic Theory of Socialism‚Äô. It refers to the direct distribution equally among the citizen body of property income accruing to the state-owned enterprises under socialism.\\" Although the social dividend concept has not yet been applied on a large scale, similar policies have been adopted on a limited basis. In both the former Soviet-type economies and non-socialist countries, the net earnings of revenue-generating state enterprises were considered a source of public revenue to be spent directly by the government to finance various public goods and services.The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism, by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: \\"The social dividend concept has not yet been applied in any important real-world context. Both in Communist and non-Communist countries, the net earnings of state firms are considered a source of public revenue and are spent directly by the government on various public goods and services.\\" The concept of a social dividend overlaps with the concept of a universal basic income guarantee, but is distinguished from basic income in that a social dividend implies social ownership of productive assets whereas a basic income does not necessarily imply social ownership and can be financed through a much broader range of sources. Unlike a basic income, the social dividend yield varies based on the performance of the socially owned economy.Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, by Marangos, John. 2004. International Journal of Political Economy, vol. 34, no. 3, Fall 2004 The social dividend can be regarded as the socialist analogue to basic income. More recently the term universal basic dividend has been used to contrast the social dividend concept with basic income. Overview Social dividends are a key feature in many models of market socialism which are characterized by publicly owned enterprises operating to maximize profit within a market economy. In such a system, the social dividend would grant every citizen a share of the property income generated by publicly owned assets and natural resources, which would be received alongside any labor income (wages and salaries) earned through employment.Philosophy and the Problems of Work: A Reader, 2001, by Kory Schaff. . (P.344): \\"A citizen in this society will receive income from three sources: wage income, which will vary depending on her skill and the amount of time she works, income forthcoming by savings, which will also vary across households, and the social dividend, that will be, in principle, approximately equal across households.\\" In contrast to cooperative variants of market socialism, where the profits of each firm are distributed among the members/employees of each individual firm, a social dividend benefits the public at large.Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, by Marangos, John. 2004. International Journal of Political Economy, vol. 34, no. 3, Fall 2004: \\"It is argued that market socialism is the only rational form of socialism, and that market socialism with labor-managed firms is by far the best form of market socialism (Jossa and Cuomo 1997: xiv). This is something quite different from the theoretical models of market socialism debated and quite different from command economies (Schweickart 1993: 90). The market socialist model proposed in this paper differs from the preceding models in that it does away with the J. E. Roemer‚ÄìP. K. Bardhan‚ÄìJ. A. Yunker social dividend-coupon economy and substitutes it with a basic income guarantee.\\" A social dividend would also eliminate the need for the social welfare and income redistribution programs, along with the administrative costs they incur, that exist in capitalist economies. The benefits of a social dividend include broadly sharing the benefits of economic growth and technological progress, greater autonomy for individual citizens, greater social and income equality, and eliminating class differences in society arising from labor income and property income. The social dividend also has advantages over a basic income by addressing the criticism that a conventional basic income can be used as justification to weaken labor protection laws and unemployment compensation, creating a population dependent upon the subsistence levels of income afforded by the basic income, and might serve to further impede the transition to a post-capitalist society. There are many institutional forms a social dividend can take. Generally, they are regarded as being universally distributed without constraint, even to unemployed individuals. However, the exact institutional arrangement varies among different proposals, for example, there might be certain constraints on the receipt of the dividend payment imposed on the unemployed. Notable economists and political scientists who have articulated social dividend models in their models of socialism include Oskar Lange, Abba Lerner, James Meade, James Yunker, John Roemer, Pranab Bardhan, David SchweickartSocial Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, by Marangos, John. 2004. International Journal of Political Economy, vol. 34, no. 3, Fall 2004. and Yanis Varoufakis. Theoretical history =Origins= As a precursor to the social dividend concept, L√©on Walras, one of the founders of neoclassical economics who helped formulate the general equilibrium theory, argued that free competition could only be realized under conditions of state ownership of natural resources and land. Walras argued that nationalized land and natural resources would provide a source of income to the state that would eliminate the need for income taxes. In Karl Marx's critique of political economy, property income is a component of surplus value, which refers to the net value above the total wage bill. The surplus value is distributed among a small minority of passive owners - capitalists and private shareholders. The capitalists appropriate the product of social labor by holding ownership titles to the means of production. While Marx was opposed to the distribution of property income under capitalism, the way property income is distributed was not the instrumentality of capitalist collapse nor was it the primary reason for the desirability of the abrogation of capitalism in Marx's view. In Marx's view capitalism was not to be opposed due to any supposedly moral defect in its distribution, but because its underlying dynamic of capital accumulation and surplus value appropriation was unstable and ultimately internally unsustainable. For Marx, socialism implied an end to this class dynamic, where the surplus product generated by the social means of production would be appropriated by all members of society.The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism, by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: \\"It is abundantly clear from the writings of the founder of scientific socialism, Karl Marx, that he viewed the distribution of property income under capitalism as morally reprehensible. To Marx, property return must be identified with 'surplus labor value', namely the excess of total labor value over the total wage bill under conditions of a subsistence individual wage. This surplus value is distributed over a small minority of owning capitalists. Although the value is created by labor and is therefore the legitimate property of labor, the capitalists are able to extort it from the proletariat by virtue of their ownership of the capital instruments of production...Nevertheless, while Marx employed the surplus labor value theory to undermine the moral foundations of capitalism, it was, in his view, neither to be the instrumentality of capitalist collapse, nor was it the primary reason for the desirability of the abrogation of capitalism...Surplus value was seen as providing the fuel for the cyclical engine and therefore as the fundamental cause of the impending dissolution of capitalism.\\" The term \\"social dividend\\" was put forth by British economist George Douglas Howard Cole in his 1935 book In Principles of Economic Planning to refer to the distribution of the net social product in the form of a cash disbursement for a socialist economy. Prior to this, most socialist economists assumed the net social product would be remitted to the population in-kind. In Cole's model, income would be distributed on the basis of work performed and on the basis of citizenship, the latter representing the social dividend that recognized \\"...each citizen's claim as a consumer to share in the common heritage of productive power.\\" The aim would be to make the dividend large enough, through greater economic growth and efficiency, to cover the basic needs of every citizen.Principles of Economic Planning, 1935, by G.D.H Cole. Macmillan and Co.. . (P.234-235): \\"How will incomes be distributed? There are two possible ways - payments for work done, and 'doles', or, to give them a less coloured name, 'social dividends'. I believe the system of distribution will be a combination of these two, but a very different combination from that which now exists. ... There will remain, broadly, two sources of income - work and citizenship. Incomes will be distributed partly as rewards for work, and partly as direct payments from the State to every citizen as 'social dividends' - a recognition of each citizen's claim as a consumer to share in the common heritage of productive power..\\" =Proposed models= Oskar Lange is credited with the first use of the term ‚Äúsocial dividend‚Äù in his seminal paper On the Economic Theory of Socialism, where he defined it as the accumulation of profit and rent minus investment by publicly owned enterprises. In Lange‚Äôs model of socialism, the social dividend would be one component of the income to consumers alongside receipts for labor services. Abba P. Lerner contributed to the idea of a social dividend by incorporating it into Lange‚Äôs original model of socialism as a lump-sum payment to each citizen as not to effect the efficient operation of labor markets. Lange‚Äôs original proposal was to have the social dividend proportionate to a person‚Äôs earnings from work. Abba Lerner‚Äôs social dividend proposal was a modification of Lange‚Äôs, where the social dividend would be distributed as a lump-sum payment and not be distributed proportionally to wages as to not disturb the efficient allocation of labor in the labor market. In Lerner‚Äôs The Economics of Control: The Economics of Welfare the social dividend also serves as an economic lever for preventing inflation and deflation. The social dividend represented the citizen‚Äôs share of the earnings of the factors of production other than labor, but in Lerner‚Äôs model, it is distributed in a way that induces consumers to spend the right amount which along with investment demand for factors would provide full employment. Lerner‚Äôs model proposed that inflation and depression could be prevented in a socialist economy by adjusting the level of the social dividend: if spending is too high, the social dividend could be set to zero or a negative (as a tax) to reduce demand.On the Economic Theory of Socialism, by Lange, Oskar. 1936. The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1: \\"It seems, therefore, convenient to regard the income of consumers as being composed of two parts: one part being the receipts for the labour services performed and the other part being a social dividend constituting the individual's share in the income derived from the capital and the natural resources owned by society.\\" British economist James Meade outlined a social dividend system within his model of what he called ‚Äúliberal socialism‚Äù. Meade advocated for a reversal of the British nationalization process in the immediate post-Second World War period, where nationalized and state-owned British industries conferred control rights without conferring income rights to the state, with the state being denied free use of its profits. In an arrangement that Meade called ‚Äútopsy-turvy nationalization‚Äù the state would act as a shareholder receiving residual income from its enterprises without being granted control rights over enterprises. The proceeds from the state-owned enterprises would finance the social dividend. The principle benefits of Meade‚Äôs system was the separation of government micromanagement from enterprise management, flexible labor markets, and widely shared benefits of economic growth among the population.Whither China?: Intellectual Politics in Contemporary China, 2002, by Xudong Zhang. Duke University Press. . (P.105-106): \\"...the UK nationalized its steel, electricity, railway and coal industries after World War II but it was only a residual controlled without residual claims, for the state received no free use of its profits...James Meade, a Nobel Laureate in economics, proposes to reverse the U.K. nationalization process. What he calls 'topsy- turvy nationalization' is essentially giving residual claims directly to the state as shareholder without granting control rights. Major benefits of topsy- turvy nationalization, according to Meade, are two: government use of the proceeds of its shareholding to finance a 'social dividend,' which will provide flexibility to the labor markets by granting minimum income to everyone; and government separation from micromanaging business decisions for the companies that it owns in part.\\" For the American economist James Yunker, as a function of public ownership of the means of production the social dividend represents the most important and fundamental benefit of a socialist system. In Yunker's model of ‚Äúpragmatic market socialism‚Äù enterprises would be organized as corporations and function almost identically to present-day capitalist firms, the major difference being that their shares would be owned by a public entity which he dubbed the ‚ÄúBureau of Public Ownership‚Äù. The major difference between capitalism and this form of market socialism involves the distribution of property income: the property return generated by publicly owned corporations would belong to the population as a whole as opposed to accruing to a minority of private owners and shareholders, thereby eliminating the class distinction between owners and workers and inequality arising from the distinction between property income and labor income, while otherwise functioning almost identically to capitalism.The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism, by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: \\"This in turn suggests a ‚Äòmarket socialist‚Äô blueprint ‚Äì the socialist system should utilize the same market allocation devices as are used presently under capitalism. The only difference is that property return (profits, rent and interest) generated by these allocation devices goes to the population as a whole rather than to an owning minority as under capitalism.\\" In John Roemer's and Pranab Bardhan's model of market socialism, public ownership takes the form of public ownership of shares in publicly listed firms. As firms are publicly owned, the dividend payments are divided equally among all adult citizens instead of accruing to a small class of private owners. The social dividend supplements individual income from wages and personal savings.Philosophy and the Problems of Work: A Reader, 2001, by Kory Schaff. . (P.344): \\"The second socialist aspect of this economy is that the profits of firms will not go to a small fraction of the citizenry but will be divided, after taxes, more or less equally among all adult citizens, taking a form that Oskar Lange called a social dividend.\\" In Beyond the Profits System: Possibilities for the Post-Capitalist Era, economist Harry Shutt advocates a basic income system to replace all existing state social security and welfare functions with the exception of childcare. This measure would be financed by the public and cooperative ownership of enterprises, and is a measure to be adopted alongside the ending of capital accumulation as the driving force in the economy. Taken together, these measures would constitute a post-capitalist economy. In February 2017, the Chinese think tank Shenzhen Innovation and Development Institute issued an Outline of Shared Development in Shenzhen which included a proposed a state-owned capital dividend fund. The goal of the proposed social dividend fund is to share the results of reform and development of Shenzhen‚Äôs state-owned enterprises. On June 16, 2017, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a study on the feasibility of a universal basic income in four OECD countries using the EUROMOD micro-simulation model. The study concluded that basic income would have mixed results and not be an efficient tool for reducing poverty, creating gainers and losers, with those currently receiving earnings- related or means-tested benefits suffering a decline in their living standards. The OECD report ends up recommending a social dividend as a partial alternative to basic income as a separate system from existing social protection, whose function would be to share the benefits of technological progress and globalization more equally. In practice Social dividend systems have been implemented in limited form on the basis of public ownership of natural resources in the state of Alaska through the Alaska Permanent Fund and in Norway by the Government Pension Fund of Norway. The Alaska Permanent Fund distributes a share in the state's wealth derived from royalty income from oil produced on state-owned land and oil reserves to each individual in the form of a dividend payment on the basis of citizenship. In the People's Republic of China regional social dividend-type systems are in place. The Macao Special Administrative Region has distributed cash disbursements to its residents since 2008 through the Wealth Partaking Scheme, with the goal of sharing the results of the region's development and enterprises with its population. Macao residents receive an annual state bonus financed mainly by lottery revenues. In the urban village of Huaidi in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, all citizens have been received an annual social dividend funded by collectively owned land development rights since 1995. Huaidi's property assets are also used to finance a range of in-kind benefits and public services. The government of Singapore distributed a \\"growth dividend\\" to most of its citizens in 2011 financed out of ballooning government revenues from high rates of economic growth. However, unlike a social dividend, the \\"growth dividend\\" was a one-time disbursement and is not a regular disbursement. Criticism In response to the socialist contention that passive shareholders and owners can be substituted for publicly owned institutional investors, Ludwig von Mises claimed that the private dividends of capitalists and speculators are necessary for calculating the opportunity costs of capital goods.Ludwig von Mises \\"Socialism, an Economic and Sociological Analysis\\" 1922, pp121. quote = \\"It is above all necessary that capital be withdrawn from particular undertakings and applied in other lines of production ... [This] is essentially a matter of the capitalists who buy and sell stocks and shares, who make loans and recover them, who speculate in all kinds of commodities‚Äù. According to Mises, attempts to replace private dividends with social dividends lead to either dis-coordinated bureaucratic planning or bureaucratic rigidity.Ludwig von Mises \\"Bureaucracy\\" 1944\\" Mises rejected Lange's proposal because financial markets provide signals that Langian market socialism lacks: > \\"Those suggesting a quasi market for the socialist system have never wanted > to preserve the stock and commodity exchanges, the trading in futures, and > the bankers and moneylenders as quasi-institutions. One cannot play > speculation and investment. The speculators and investors expose their own > wealth, their own destiny...\\" Mises 1949 p705 MacKenzie asserts that John Roemer's proposed socialist \\"stock market\\" fails to provide a sufficient basis for efficient capital investment, and that equalization of stock ownership precludes an efficient division of labor between those who do and do not have a comparative advantage in planning capital projects.D.W. MacKenzie \\"Social Dividends, Entrepreneurial Rules, and Bureaucratic Rules, Eastern Economic Journal, March 2016\\" Related concepts Social dividends have an alternate definition as the citizen's egalitarian share of surplus tax revenue. This form of social dividend exists within the framework of capitalism since productive assets would be privately owned, operated for private profits and would not directly finance the social dividend.

It was a common method of government in Europe in the Middle Ages.Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe, Peter Heather. Page 529 Description A monarch would travel around his realm, stopping on the way and staying a few days in the towns and settlements through which he passed. There, he would be informed of recent events and deal with any legal cases that needed hearing. He would also consume local produce, hosting feasts for local dignitaries. An example of itineration is King Henry I of England's travels in 1114. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (versions E and H): > king Henry was in Windsor at Christmas, and wore his crown there... The king > spent Easter at Kingsthorpe near Northampton... The king spent Whit Sunday > at St. Albans. Thereafter, at midsummer, he went with his levies into > Wales... Thereafter he came to Winchester... Thereafter he went oversea > [sic] into Normandy. According to Peter Heather, \\"itineration was the key mechanism of government in the new entities of northern and eastern Europe\\" in the eleventh century. However, this produced a situation where core territories were \\"subject to permanent, more intensive control, and peripheral ones that were liable to fall under the control of others as the power of individual dynasts waxed and waned\\". England was one of the first Medieval Kingdoms to begin the process of creating a permanent center of government. Prior to the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Saxons had created a permanent treasury at Winchester around which a nucleus of government functions began to grow. The Normans continued this institution with the creation of the Exchequer by Henry I. In 1150, some years after Henry's death, the Exchequer was established at the Palace of Westminster. The tradition continues to the present day, with the office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer at nearby 11 Downing Street, adjacent to number 10, the office of the First Lord of the Treasury who in modern times is also the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and just a block from HM Treasury at 1 Horse Guards Road. Explanation Communications in the Middle Ages were not good and it was difficult for a monarch to keep abreast of what was happening in their lands, so travel was essential.A Moveable Feast?, jstor.org According to Heather, a \\"ruler really governed only where they regularly travelled\\"Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe, Peter Heather and for this reason, realms relied \\"less on bureaucratic structures for their cohesion and more on the power and charisma of individual monarchs\\". One other significant reason for itineration was food. With the inability to store produce other than by salting it, it was necessary for a monarch to go to his food.Bloodfeud: Murder and Revenge in Anglo-Saxon England, R. A. Fletcher. Page 27 Decline The European monarchs often warred against each other. Wars were costly affairs however, and as monarchs were constantly looking for ways to increase the size and effectiveness of their armies, the costs of their armies rose exponentially. This forced the monarchs to find new and better ways of taxing the population in order to pay for the armies. This in turn required larger bureaucratic structures. As the governments expanded, it became less and less efficient to keep a mobile government. As institutions became centralized, they were settled down permanently. Eventually, it became unfeasible and unnecessary for the monarch to constantly travel through his domains. By the 16th century, most states had permanent, non-mobile governments, and most monarchs had settled down. One of the last monarchs to travel around his domains was Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, but because his domains were so extensive, he was forced to develop more permanent systems of governing. His successor, Philip II of Spain, did not travel through his domains, instead preferring to focus his government at El Escorial in Castile.

It had a capacity of more than 3,500 people; that is to say, 1,500 more seats than the present- day Palacio de Bellas Artes. Historians consider it the most important architectural work in Mexico City between the completion of the Metropolitan Cathedral and the building of the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The Great National Theatre was inaugurated in one of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's terms as president. Its name changed successively, from Great Theatre of Santa Anna to Great Theatre Vergara, then Great Imperial Theatre, and finally Great National Theatre.

Created by Bill Willingham, the Pentacle first appeared in Shadowpact #1 (July 2006). Shadowpact When the Pentacle's leader, Strega, created a hemogoblin bubble barrier that was impenetrable, the Shadowpact was called by the Phantom Stranger, who opened a doorway to the bubble for them to enter and for them to find out what was going on. The Pentacle was taking over a small part of a town and was using the residents as human sacrifices to complete a spell used by Strega. As soon as the Shadowpact entered the bubble, Nightshade ran into a member of the Pentacle, Sister Shadow, and the two quickly fought.Shadowpact #1 (July 2006) Meanwhile, the rest of the Pentacle became aware of the Shadowpact's presence and the two groups began to fight each other. During each fight, it was shown that the Pentacle mirrored the Shadowpact. While all members of the Pentacle took down their counterparts, each one was to not kill them and to bring their unconscious Shadowpact member to Strega so they could imprison them. However, only one member of the Pentacle, Karnevil, didn't follow orders. Instead of bringing his counterpart, Detective Chimp, to Strega, Karnevil tied him to a post and prepared to torture him.Shadowpact #2 (August 2006) When Karnevil returned to Strega without Detective Chimp, Strega demanded that he retrieved Chimp so they could put him with the rest of his teammates. When Karnevil returned to the post, Detective Chimp had escaped and then he easily subdued Karnevil. Then, another member of the Pentacle, the White Rabbit, felt disgusted by Strega's ways of killing, so he freed the Shadowpact. Enchantress took him out, however, knowing that he still couldn't be trusted. While Enchantress and Nightmaster thought of a spell to destroy the barrier, the rest of the team (excluding Detective Chimp) took down the remaining members of the Pentacle. When Detective Chimp finally caught up with the three, Enchantress' spell took effect, which had burst the barrier. After the Shadowpact discovered Strega had gotten away, they realized that the whole time they were in the barrier, a year had passed by in the world outside of it, causing each of them to age one year, all due to Enchantress' spell.Shadowpact #3 (September 2006) Blue Devil then sent Jack of Fire to Hell with his trident, while Nightshade trapped the remaining four in darkness cubes of hers and then the Shadowpact sent them to the Black Tower, a prison in another dimension.Shadowpact #5 (November 2006) =Current whereabouts= The Pentacle is currently no longer together and has not been since they've been imprisoned.

Spanky and Mert first go to a liquor store to buy some hard liquor to take with them to the party, but since they are both underage, they try to find someone who will buy the liquor for them. Spanky meets two prostitutes, named Princess and Strawberry, who agree to buy them the hard liquor so the guys can take them to the party. On their way there, they all smoke a little of the magical pot which makes Mert drive erratically and they are pulled over by a local cop. Mert is forced to throw the pot stash out the window to avoid being arrested for possession of narcotics. the female police officer who pulls them over is also a loose woman who gets a contact high from the marijuana smoke and lets them off with only a warning. In attempting to retrieve the pot, the stash gets stolen by a young girl who picks it up off the street. Spanky and Mert chase the young girl to a house where a birthday party for a young boy is being held. Pretending to be friends of the birthday boy, Spanky and Mert enter and venture to the basement where a \\"pot party\\" is being held by the older brother of the birthday boy. Mert manages to retrieve the pot from the 11-year-old drug dealer, while Spanky takes drags on various joints to find the right one, and when he goes into a bedroom to have an encounter with a party girl, he finds the girl to be his 14-year-old underage sister Ellen, who has a secret life as 'Sara the Skank' while hooking up with numerous guys at parties. Spanky and Mert flee the house and meet again with Princess and Strawberry on the street by their van where they have another run-in with Pinky, who Mert manage to calm down and invite to the party by having her smoke a little of the grass. The guys with their girls finally arrive at the pool party where Mert attempts to make a few of the women there smoke the magical pot, only to lose the stash. One of the women smokes it and gives it to some of her friends which turns the party into a full-on lesbian orgy. Yet, Mert and Spanky are left out when Spanky hooks up with Princess and Mert hooks up with Pinky. Strawberry hooks up with the home's owner. The next morning when the party is over, the guys and all the party guests leave. Spanky says goodbye to Princess who returns to her original life no longer a streetwalker. Mert, who still prides himself on being a world class jerk, dumps Pinky so he can focus on looking for his next one-night stand, and now Pinky focuses her attention on getting back at Mert. Spanky goes to meet with his parents where they pick him up to take him home. He tells them that his weekend was \\"uneventful\\".

A Royal Navy man-of-war under Captain Chaloner Ogle defeated the pirate ship of Bartholomew Roberts off the coast of Gabon, West Africa. Background Bartholomew was the most successful pirate during the Golden Age; he captured well over 400 vessels ranging from small fishing boats to large frigates. In April 1721, Roberts, also known as \\"Black Bart\\", was sailing the coast of Martinique when he came across a French frigate of fifty- two guns and captured her. Aboard the vessel was the governor of the French colony who was hung by Roberts from the yardarm of his ship. This act proved to be his downfall as it was apparently the final straw; in retaliation for Black Bart's repeated attacks on fleets of merchant ships and his killing of the governor, the French Navy and the Royal Navy dispatched several warships to hunt the pirates. Roberts and his men captured the two French warships off the Senegal Rivers mouth, the sixteen-gun sloop-of-war Comte de Toulouse and a ten-gun brig. Comte de Toulouse was renamed the Ranger and the brig Little Ranger. After taking the two Frenchmen, the pirates sailed southeast for the present day Gabon. While on the way, off the coast of Pepper Coast Roberts sighted and captured the Royal Africa Company frigate Onslow which he renamed the Royal Fortune. The frigate mounted over forty guns and the crew consisted of about 250 men, black and white. Black Bart's luck was soon to run out though, as two Royal Navy men-of-war began patrolling the waters of West Africa, at about the same time, Roberts anchored in Cape Lopez for careening. The Royal Navy vessels on patrol were the fourth-rates HMS Swallow and HMS Weymouth, both mounting fifty guns or more but only the Swallow under Captain Chaloner Ogle encountered Black Bart. When Captain Ogle sailed around the cape he sighted four vessels, three of them pirates and one a merchant ship the 'Neptune' belonging to a Captain Hill, which was illegally trading with the brigands. Ogle spotted a sandbar and quickly ordered his ship to turn out of the way, at the same time raising a Portuguese flag. By this time the pirates had spotted the Swallow so Roberts allowed Captain James Skyrme in the Ranger to capture what he thought was a fleeing merchant ship. Sensing an opportunity, Captain Ogle chose to let the pirate chase him for several hours until they were far away from the cape and land was no longer in sight. Ogle then turned about, raised the White Ensign and engaged Captain Skyrme, who still did not realize the Swallow was a Royal Navy frigate. After a relatively short action, the sloop was captured, made a prize, and ten pirates were killed. Ogle then patiently sailed back to Cape Lopez where he arrived five days later on February 10, 1722. Battle Bartholomew Roberts and his fleet in the background attacking merchant ships off Quidah in 1721. According to legend; at this time Black Bart Roberts was eating breakfast of salmagundi with Captain Hill of the captured ship 'Neptune' aboard the 'Royal Fortune' when one of his crew shouted that the Ranger was returning from her chase with the merchant ship. A few moments later they discovered the incoming vessel was not their sloop but the Swallow. One of the pirates, a man named Armstrong who had absconded from the 'Swallow's' sister ship 'Weymouth' at Madeira, recognized the Royal Navy frigate and told Captain Roberts. Without fear Roberts boarded the Royal Fortune and as he did before all of his battles, he dressed in his finest clothing, a red damask waistcoat and a red feather in his hat, and began organizing his escape. Most of the crew from the Little Ranger was ordered to join the crew of the Royal Fortune so as to keep as many pirates as possible aboard the flagship for defense. The 'Little Ranger' which was hauled on her side being cleaned at the time, was abandoned. When the pirates left, Captain Hill's crew went aboard the 'Little Ranger' and looted gold and other valuables, and sailed off for Prince's Island (S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe). Roberts' plan called for him to sail directly for the Swallow in order to quickly pass her and then escape. By doing this the Swallow would have to turn about to engage or chase the Royal Fortune which would give Roberts valuable time to flee. The plan however had one default, by sailing right past the Royal Navy frigate, the Royal Fortune would be exposed to one of Swallows deadly broadsides. Captain Roberts set out for his escape and issued the command for Little Ranger and the merchantman to leave. The following action ended badly for the pirates. When Royal Fortune was off Swallows beam, she released a massive broadside which raked the ship. The pirates opened fire and then an additional broadside from the Swallow raked the deck where Black Bart was commanding. The pirates got clear and ran ahead of the wind, leaving the 'Swallow' behind. The action took place during a fierce tropical storm, and just as the 'Royal Fortune' seemed to have escaped the ship hit the 'eye' of the storm, and were suddenly becalmed for half an hour. This gave the unaffected 'Swallow' time to catch up, and when they were in range, they fired their swivels (guns mounted on the bow which fired grape shot) at the 'Royal Fortune'. Three men died, one of them being Bartholomew Roberts. A piece of shot no bigger than a penny, hit him in the throat, severed his spinal column, and he died instantly. He settled down onto a gun, to initial observers that he was taking a rest but when the smoke had cleared away Black Bart was dead and Captain Ogle later allowed his crew to bury him at sea, which they did in all his finery, including a diamond studded six inch cross on a chain which he wore around his neck. The pirates, determined to avenge their captain, chose to continue to fight, slowing down their vessel and turning around to continue the engagement. According to some accounts the action lasted for around three hours before cannon fire from the ship of the line dismasted the pirate frigate and boarded. Royal Fortunes colors were struck by force and the remaining pirates were arrested. Aftermath Sir Chaloner Ogle Bartholomew Roberts was killed at the very beginning of the battle during the second broadside unleashed by the ship of the line. Several men were killed or wounded on both sides and 272 pirates taken prisoner in all. Many were wounded and died in captivity on their way to the prison of Cape Coast Castle. Fifty-four pirates were hanged for their deeds and thirty- Seventeen went to Marshalsea prison in London and twenty became indentured servants for the Royal African Company. Dozens of pirates escaped punishment as they were forced into a life with Roberts' pirates to begin with. Captain Chaloner Ogle benefitted from the battle significantly, besides being knighted and becoming an admiral he took off several ounces of gold dust from the Ranger and the Royal Fortune. After defeating Roberts; Captain Ogle intended to sail back and take the Little Ranger which was also carrying gold but she and the merchantman escaped and it is said that Captain Hill received most of the remaining gold. With the death of \\"Black Bart\\", piracy in the Atlantic Ocean died off and the Golden Age ended by 1730.

It is a Grade II listed building. History After an architectural competition, the Kiel City Council commissioned the architect Heinrich Seeling in 1902 to build the theatre, for both theatre performances and music. The construction of the brick building with a richly arranged sandstone and richly modeled roof zone took place from 1905 to 1907.Hartwig Beseler, Niels Gutschow: Kriegsschicksale Deutscher Architektur. Band I: Nord. Wachholtz, Neum√ºnster o.J., S. 7f. On October 1, 1907, the theater was inaugurated with a performance of Fidelio. During the Second World War, Allied air raids on 13 December 1943, 22 May 1944 and 24 July 1944 damaged the city theatres heavily. In the course of the destruction, the art nouveau interior decoration was lost. The reconstruction was carried out from 1950 to 1953, under the direction of Heinrich Hansen and Guido Widmann, while retaining the enclosing walls. The roof shapes were redesigned to simplify the cubic stage house. Werner Kallmorgen was responsible for the interior fittings. The reopening of the theatre took place on June 21, 1953 on the occasion of the Kiel Week, again with a performance of Fidelio. In 1972 the reconstruction of the \\"Kleine Kiel\\" stairs was started. In the same year, the foundation stone for the erection of the business building was laid on the corner of Rathausstra√üe / Fleeth√∂rn. The completely black-glazed building according to a design by Werner Kallmorgen has no obvious connection with the architecture of the original ensemble. On 16 March 1993, the opera house was designated a cultural monument of particular importance in the monument register. The Kiel Ballet was directed by Mario Schr√∂der from 2001 to 2010 as a ballet director and chief choreographer, and in 2011 Yaroslav Ivanenko and Heather Jurgensen took over the ballet management.

She was the half sister of Sultan Selim III. Early life Hatice Sultan was born on 14 June 1768 in the Topkapƒ± Palace. Her father was Sultan Mustafa III, and her mother was Adil≈üah Kadƒ±n. She had a full sister named Beyhan Sultan, two years elder than her. After her father's death in 1774, when she was six years old, she followed her mother and sister to the Old Palace. Marriage On 3 November 1786, her uncle Sultan Abdul Hamid I betrothed her to the guardian of Khotin, Vezir Seyyid Ahmed Pasha. The marriage took place six days later on 9 November, and on the same day her she and her trousseau was carried to her palace located in Arnavutk√∂y√º. Hatice remained childless. She was allowed to accompany her husband when he was exiled to ƒ∞zmit. However, three years later, when he was appointed the governor of Egypt, she had to return to Istanbul. She was widowed at his death in 1798, and like most of the princesses of her generation she didn't remarry. Alaeddin Pasha, the son of Damad Seyyid Ahmed Pasha, married her cousin Hibetullah Sultan. Patroness of architecture Engraving of the Hatice Sultan Mansion, by Antoine Ignace Melling, about 1800 Antoine Ignace Melling, an architect-cum-designer, began working for her in the 1790s. Melling, born in Karlsruhe to a family of artists from Lorraine, lived in Istanbul for eighteen years between 1784 and 1802. The multi-talented artist caught the attention of the princess while working for Friedrich H√ºbsch, the Danish charg√© d‚Äôaffaires, whom she had visited at his villa in B√ºy√ºkdere. She was the collector or porcelain, she had developed engrossment of porcelain from Saxony, Vienna and France. Hatice had been allocated the Ne≈üatabad Palace in 1791, at Defterdarburnu on the European shores of the Bosphorus. The reconstruction of her palace took three years, and was completed in 1794. She took insatiable interest in the decoration of her palace. After her death her palace was allocated to Adile Sultan after her marriage in 1845, she spent her winters in Ne≈üatabad Palace until 1866. Sultan Selim III is known to have paid frequent visits to his half-sisters, which became all the more regular during Ramadan. He visited Hatice repeatedly for iftar banquets, and even had apartments reserved for overnight stays at Defterdarburnu. Hatice was close to Selim, who cared for her genuinely. Selim shared with her his detailed plans to acquaint the \\"devout and unbending\\" Muslims with European arts and civilization. Hatice appears to have adopted Selim's ideas and preferences as her own. Melling acquired European goods for Hatice and also taught her the Latin alphabet. Melling's beautiful sketches of the newly built mansions along the waterfront clearly exhibit the influence of French neoclassical, baroque, and rococo styles used in the construction, decoration, and furnishings of the palace of Hatice Sultan and those of other dignitaries in Istanbul. The letters testify not only to Hatice's insatiable interest in the decoration of her palace, but also to her drive and desire to be in command at all times a few letters concerning some chairs, perhaps (imitations of) French imports in the French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI style, are a case in point. at the time chairs and armchairs were a novelty in Ottoman interiors. Hatice had an alleged intimate relationship with Melling from 1796 to 1800, after which Selim distanced himself from her. In 1800 Melling was apparently forced to quit her service, and in mid-1802 he left Istanbul for good. Immediately afterwards, Selim recommenced his visits to her. In 1806, Hatice commissioned a fountain in her name around the Spice Bazaar in Istanbul. In 1805, Hatice Sultan built Adil≈üah Kadƒ±n Mosque, ≈ûi≈üehane Mosque in the memory of her mother. Death Hatice Sultan died on 17 July 1822, at the age of fifty four, and was buried in the mausoleum of Mihri≈üah Sultan located in Ey√ºp. After her death, her belongings were confiscated and sold at auction, her probate inventories included more than five hundred pieces of European porcelain, which appear to have been kept in three different parts of her palace.

Forming in July 2004, the four piece originally conformed by songwriter / guitarist and vocalist Owen Hughes-Holland along with guitarist Adam Mason, bassist Dan Oehlman and drummer William Gates. After embarking on numerous tours the band made a significant impact on the UK's underground rock scene. They have shared the stage with Senses Fail, LostProphets, Sikth, Architects, Enter Shikari, You Me at Six, The Blackout and No Use for a Name.

Daniel Tompkins joins the band shortly after their UK tour with Exit Ten. They worked in the album production with band's friend Acle Kahney, Who had previously produced the Myspace demo of the song \\"Through The Exterior\\". The band also announced that three songs from the previous EP were in the main album. The songs were \\"The Saviour\\", \\"Expert in Trickery\\" and \\"Day of the Collapse\\". The band explained why they put previous material in their first full length in an interview with Altsounds. Bassist Simon Poulton stated: \\"We were a little uncomfortable at first about using slightly older material, and I think if we'd done the album as a 4 piece, we wouldn't have used them. Having Dan join the band really revived those songs though, the arrangements have been bettered. We can now obviously do the songs justice with Dan's voice, they now sound the way we wanted them to sound before, and we definitely want more people to hear them!\\" The band also released a split EP with The Casino Brawl and Elias Last Day via Smalltown Records. The EP featured two tracks from each band. FSOF song's were \\"Through The Exterior\\" and \\"Sing Sing Aint My Style\\". The split was well received, as FSOF was reviewed as the most original and promising of the three bands. =Departure of Tompkins from Atlantic (2009‚Äìpresent)= On 18 July 2009 the band announced on their Myspace's official blog that vocalist Daniel Tompkins will leave the band. However they also stated that they were still friends and that they wished him \\"the absolute best for the future\\". Later it would be stated in an interview that Tompkins would leave the band due to other commitments.

Musical style and influences FSOF has been tagged in such a variety of musical styles as post-hardcore, progressive rock, alternative metal and ambient music among other genres. The band's sound has been also compared with Sikth and Funeral For a Friend early stuff with a little more technicality and creativity, managing to produce a balanced mix between technical riffs and catchy melodies. They have stated that everyone in the band has such wide-ranging musical tastes, that it lends itself to an interesting songwriting process, and the principal reason of FSOF being tagged as a 'technical' band, is because the constant use of time changes in their songs.

It is the oldest settlement in Greater Ballarat. Gold was discovered at Poverty Point on 21 August 1851 by John Dunlop and James Regan, sparking the Ballarat gold rush. Golden Point was the site of what was known as the Ballarat diggings, and for at least a decade the focal point of the original Ballarat township was Main Street. At the , Golden Point had a population of 2,107. Golden Point is bordered by the Yarrowee River to the west, Steinfield, Eureka and Callow Streets to the north, Larter Street to the east and Gladstone, Magpie and Elsworth Streets to the south. The topography varies, from the floodplain of Specimen Vale from Golden Point Hill (after which the suburb was named). Poverty Point gold discovery marker Sovereign Hill Historical Park Golden Point is notable as the location (atop Golden Point Hill) of the Sovereign Hill Historic Park, which depicts the area around Main Street; the Observation lookout from which the Ballarat skyline can be viewed and the Ballarat Gold Museum.  History  The area was once known as Poverty Point. However, on 21 August 1851 prospectors John Dunlop and James Regan struck a few ounces of gold when passing through the area; the announcement of this discovery is attributed to sparking the Ballarat Gold Rush, hence the poetic name change. A historical marker for the location of the discovery is located in a reserve just off Clayton Street. With the establishment of the township of Ballarat West, Main Street went into steep decline in the 1860s and 1870s before being almost completely decimated by a disastrous fire. In 1970, Sovereign Hill Historic Park was constructed, with the aim of recreating the original Golden Point settlement, although set on the hill rather than the original valley, it features many of the early timber buildings which once lined the Main Street, Golden Point in the 1850s, along with many aspects of life and industry from that era.

In it, Linnaeus introduced binomial nomenclature for animals, something he had already done for plants in his 1753 publication of Species Plantarum. Starting point Before 1758, most biological catalogues had used polynomial names for the taxa included, including earlier editions of Systema Naturae. The first work to consistently apply binomial nomenclature across the animal kingdom was the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature therefore chose 1 January 1758 as the \\"starting point\\" for zoological nomenclature, and asserted that the 10th edition of Systema Naturae was to be treated as if published on that date. Names published before that date are unavailable, even if they would otherwise satisfy the rules. The only work which takes priority over the 10th edition is Carl Alexander Clerck's ' or ', which was published in 1757, but is also to be treated as if published on January 1, 1758. Revisions An oil painting of Carl Linnaeus by Alexander Roslin in 1775 During Linnaeus' lifetime, Systema Naturae was under continuous revision. Progress was incorporated into new and ever-expanding editions; for example, in his 1st edition (1735), whales and manatees were originally classified as species of fish (as was thought to be the case then), but in the 10th edition they were moved into the mammal class. Animals The animal kingdom (as described by Linnaeus): \\"Animals enjoy sensation by means of a living organization, animated by a medullary substance; perception by nerves; and motion by the exertion of the will. They have members for the different purposes of life; organs for their different senses; and faculties (or powers) for the application of their different perceptions. They all originate from an egg. Their external and internal structure; their comparative anatomy, habits, instincts, and various relations to each other, are detailed in authors who professedly treat on their subjects.\\" The list has been broken down into the original six classes Linnaeus described for animals; Mammalia, Aves, Amphibia, Pisces, Insecta, and Vermes. These classes were ultimately created by studying the internal anatomy, as seen in his key: *Heart with two auricles, two ventricles. Warm, red blood **Viviparous: Mammalia **Oviparous: Aves *Heart with one auricle, one ventricle. Cold, red blood **Lungs voluntary: Amphibia **External gills: Pisces *Heart with one auricle, no ventricles. Cold, pus-like blood **Have antennae: Insecta **Have tentacles: Vermes By current standards Pisces and Vermes are informal groupings, Insecta also contained arachnids and crustaceans, and one order of Amphibia comprised sharks, lampreys, and sturgeons. =Mammalia= The Barbary macaque was included in the 10th edition as Simia sylvanus. Linnaeus described mammals as: \\"Animals that suckle their young by means of lactiferous teats. In external and internal structure they resemble man: most of them are quadrupeds; and with man, their natural enemy, inhabit the surface of the Earth. The largest, though fewest in number, inhabit the ocean.\\" Linnaeus divided the mammals based upon the number, situation, and structure of their teeth, into the following orders and genera: *Primates: Homo (humans), Simia (monkeys & apes), Lemur (lemurs & colugos) & Vespertilio (bats) *Bruta: Elephas (elephants), Trichechus (manatees), Bradypus (sloths), Myrmecophaga (anteaters) & Manis (pangolins) *Ferae: Phoca (seals), Canis (dogs & hyenas), Felis (cats), Viverra (mongooses & civets), Mustela (weasels & kin) & Ursus (bears) *Bestiae: Sus (pigs), Dasypus (armadillos), Erinaceus (hedgehogs), Talpa (moles), Sorex (shrews) & Didelphis (opossums) *Glires: Rhinoceros (rhinoceroses), Hystrix (porcupines), Lepus (rabbits & hares), Castor (beavers), Mus (mice & kin) & Sciurus (squirrels) *Pecora: Camelus (camels), Moschus (musk deer), Cervus (deer & giraffes), Capra (goats & antelope), Ovis (sheep) & Bos (cattle) *Belluae: Equus (horses) & Hippopotamus (hippopotamuses) *Cete: Monodon (narwhals), Balaena (rorquals), Physeter (sperm whales) & Delphinus (dolphins & porpoises) =Aves= The snowy owl was included in the 10th edition as Strix scandiaca. Linnaeus described birds as: \\"A beautiful and cheerful portion of created nature consisting of animals having a body covered with feathers and down; protracted and naked jaws (the beak), two wings formed for flight, and two feet. They are areal, vocal, swift and light, and destitute of external ears, lips, teeth, scrotum, womb, bladder, epiglottis, corpus callosum and its arch, and diaphragm.\\" Linnaeus divided the birds based upon the characters of the bill and feet, into the following 6 orders and 63 genera: *Accipitres: Vultur (vultures & condors), Falco (falcons, eagles, & kin), Strix (owls) & Lanius (shrikes) *Picae: Psittacus (parrots), Ramphastos (toucans), Buceros (hornbills), Crotophaga (anis), Corvus (crows & ravens), Coracias (rollers & orioles), Gracula (mynas), Paradisea (birds-of-paradise), Cuculus (cuckoos), Jynx (wrynecks), Picus (woodpeckers), Sitta (nuthatches), Alcedo (kingfishers), Merops (bee-eaters), Upupa (hoopoes), Certhia (treecreepers) & Trochilus (hummingbirds) *Anseres: Anas (ducks, geese, & swans), Mergus (mergansers), Alca (auks & puffins), Procellaria (petrels), Diomedea (albatrosses & penguins), Pelecanus (pelicans & kin), Phaethon (tropicbirds), Colymbus (grebes & loons), Larus (gulls), Sterna (terns) & Rhyncops (skimmers) *Grallae: Phoenicopterus (flamingoes), Platalea (spoonbills), Mycteria & Tantulus (storks), Ardea (herons, cranes, & kin), Scolopax (godwits, ibises, & kin), Tringa (phalaropes and sandpipers), Charadrius (plovers), Recurvirostra (avocets), Haematopus (oystercatchers), Fulica (coots & kin), Rallus (rails), Psophia (trumpeters), Otis (bustards) & Struthio (ostriches) *Gallinae: Pavo (peafowl), Meleagris (turkeys), Crax (curassows), Phasianus (pheasants & chickens) & Tetrao (grouse & kin) *Passeres: Columba (pigeons & doves), Alauda (larks & pipits), Sturnus (starlings), Turdus (thrushes), Loxia (cardinals, bullfinches, & kin), Emberiza (buntings), Fringilla (finches), Motacilla (wagtails), Parus (tits & chickadees), Hirundo (swallows & swifts) & Caprimulgus (nightjars) =Amphibia= The common frog was included in the 10th edition as Rana temporaria. Linnaeus described his \\"Amphibia\\" (comprising reptiles and amphibians) as: \\"Animals that are distinguished by a body cold and generally naked; stern and expressive countenance; harsh voice; mostly lurid color; filthy odor; a few are furnished with a horrid poison; all have cartilaginous bones, slow circulation, exquisite sight and hearing, large pulmonary vessels, lobate liver, oblong thick stomach, and cystic, hepatic, and pancreatic ducts: they are deficient in diaphragm, do not transpire (sweat), can live a long time without food, are tenacious of life, and have the power of reproducing parts which have been destroyed or lost; some undergo a metamorphosis; some cast (shed) their skin; some appear to live promiscuously on land or in the water, and some are torpid during the winter.\\" Linnaeus divided the amphibians based upon the limb structures and the way they breathed, into the following orders and genera: *Reptiles: Testudo (turtles & tortoises), Draco (gliding lizards), Lacerta (terrestrial lizards, salamanders, & crocodilians) & Rana (frogs & toads) *Serpentes: Crotalus (rattlesnakes), Boa (boas), Coluber (racers & cobras), Anguis (slowworms & worm snakes), Amphisbaena (worm lizards) & Coecilia (caecilians) *Nantes: Petromyzon (lampreys), Raja (rays), Squalus (sharks), Chimaera (ratfishes), Lophius (anglerfishes) & Acipenser (sturgeons) =Pisces= The butterfly blenny was included in the 10th edition as Blennius ocellatus. Linnaeus described fish as: \\"Always inhabiting the waters; are swift in their motion and voracious in their appetites. They breathe by means of gills, which are generally united by a bony arch; swim by means of radiate fins, and are mostly covered over with cartilaginous scales. Besides they parts they have in common with other animals, they are furnished with a nictitant membrane, and most of them with a swim-bladder, by the contraction or dilatation of which, they can raise or sink themselves in their element at pleasure.\\" Linnaeus divided the fishes based upon the position of the ventral and pectoral fins, into the following orders and genera: *Apodes: Muraena (eels), Gymnotus (electric knifefishes), Trichiurus (cutlassfishes), Anarhichas (wolffishes), Ammodytes (sand eels), Stromateus (butterfishes) & Xiphias (swordfishes) *Jugulares: Callionymus (dragonets), Uranoscopus (stargazers), Trachinus (weevers), Gadus (cod & kin) & Ophidion (cusk-wels) *Thoracici: Cyclopterus (lumpfishes), Echeneis (remoras), Coryphaena (dolphinfishes), Gobius (gobies), Cottus (sculpins), Scorpaena (scorpionfishes), Zeus (john dories), Pleuronectes (flatfishes), Chaetodon (butterflyfishes), Sparus (breams & porgies), Labrus (wrasses), Sciaena (snappers), Perca (perch), Gasterosteus (sticklebacks), Scomber (mackerel & tuna), Mullus (goatfishes) & Trigla (sea robins) *Abdominales: Cobitis (loaches), Silurus (catfishes), Loricaria (suckermouth catfishes), Salmo (salmon & trout), Fistularia (cornetfishes), Esox (pike), Argentina (herring smelts), Atherina (silversides), Mugil (mullet), Exocoetus (flying fishes), Polynemus (threadfins), Clupea (herring) & Cyprinus (carp) *Branchiostegi: Mormyrus (elephantfishes), Balistes (triggerfishes), Ostracion (boxfishes), Tetrodon (pufferfishes), Diodon (porcupinefishes), Centriscus (snipefishes), Syngnathus (pipefishes & seahorses) & Pegasus (seamoths) =Insecta = Crustaceans such as the water flea Monoculus pulex (now Daphnia pulex) were included in Linnaeus' Insecta. Cicada septendecim to an insect whose adult appears once in 17 years. Linnaeus described his \\"Insecta\\" (comprising all arthropods, including insects, crustaceans, arachnids and others) as: \\"A very numerous and various class consisting of small animals, breathing through lateral spiracles, armed on all sides with a bony skin, or covered with hair; furnished with many feet, and moveable antennae (or horns), which project from the head, and are the probable instruments of sensation.\\" Linnaeus divided the insects based upon the form of the wings, into the following orders and genera: *Coleoptera: Scarabaeus (scarab beetles), Dermestes (larder beetles), Hister (clown beetles), Attelabus (leaf-rolling weevils), Curculio (true weevils), Silpha (carrion beetles), Coccinella (ladybirds or ladybugs), Cassida (tortoise beetles), Chrysomela (leaf beetles), Meloe (blister beetles), Tenebrio (darkling beetles), Mordella (tumbling flower beetles), Staphylinus (rove beetles), Cerambyx (longhorn beetles), Cantharis (soldier beetles), Elater (click beetles), Cicindela (ground beetles), Buprestis (jewel beetles), Dytiscus (Dytiscidae), Carabus (Carabus species), ' (necydaline beetles), Forficula (earwigs), Blatta (cockroaches) & Gryllus (other orthopteroid insects) *Hemiptera: Cicada (cicadas), Notonecta (backswimmers), Nepa (water scorpions), Cimex (bedbugs), Aphis (aphids), Chermes (woolly aphids), Coccus (scale insects) & Thrips (thrips) *Lepidoptera: Papilio (butterflies), Sphinx (hawk moths), Phalaena (moths) *Neuroptera: Libellula (dragonflies & damselflies), Ephemera (mayflies), Phryganea (caddisflies), Hemerobius (lacewings), Panorpa (scorpionflies) & Raphidia (snakeflies) *Hymenoptera: Cynips (Gall wasps), Tenthredo (sawflies), Ichneumon (ichneumon wasps), Sphex (digger wasps), Vespa (hornets), Apis (bees), Formica (ants) & Mutilla (velvet ants) *Diptera: Oestrus (botflies), Tipula (crane flies), Musca (house flies), Tabanus (horse flies), Culex (mosquitoes), Empis (dance flies), Conops (thick-headed flies), Asilus (robber flies), Bombylius (bee flies) & Hippobosca (louse flies) *Aptera: Lepisma (silverfish), Podura (springtails), Termes (termites), Pediculus (lice), Pulex (fleas), Acarus (mites & ticks), Phalangium (harvestmen), Aranea (spiders), Scorpio (scorpions), Cancer (crabs, lobsters and kin), Monoculus (water fleas & kin), Oniscus (woodlice), Scolopendra (centipedes) & Julus (millipedes) =Vermes= The common cuttlefish was named Sepia officinalis in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Linnaeus described his \\"Vermes\\" as: \\"Animals of slow motion, soft substance, able to increase their bulk and restore parts which have been destroyed, extremely tenacious of life, and the inhabitants of moist places. Many of them are without a distinct head, and most of them without feet. They are principally distinguished by their tentacles (or feelers). By the Ancients they were not improperly called imperfect animals, as being destitute of ears, nose, head, eyes and legs; and are therefore totally distinct from Insects.\\" Linnaeus divided the \\"Vermes\\" based upon the structure of the body, into the following orders and genera: *Intestina: Gordius (horsehair worms), Furia, Lumbricus (earthworms), Ascaris (giant intestinal roundworms), Fasciola (liver flukes), Hirudo (leeches), Myxine (hagfishes), Teredo (shipworms) *Mollusca: Limax (terrestrial slugs), Doris (dorid nudibranchs), Tethys (tethydid sea slugs), Nereis (polychaete worms), Aphrodita (sea mice), Lernaea (anchor worms), Priapus (priapulid worms & sea anemones), Scyllaea (scyllaeid sea slugs), Holothuria (salps & Portuguese Man o' War), Triton (triton shells), Sepia (octopuses, squids, & cuttlefishes), Medusa (jellyfishes), Asterias (starfishes), Echinus (sea urchins) *Testacea: Chiton (chitons), Lepas (barnacles), Pholas (piddocks & angelwings), Myes (soft-shell clams), Solen (saltwater clams), Tellina (tellinid shellfishes), Cardium (cockles), Donax (wedge shells), Venus (Venus clams), Spondylus (thorny oysters), Chama (jewel box shells), Arca (ark clams), Ostrea (true oysters), Anomia (saddle oysters), Mytilus (saltwater mussels), Pinna (pen shells), Argonauta (paper nautiluses), Nautilus (nautiluses), Conus (cone snails), Cypraea (cowries), Bulla (bubble shells), Voluta (volutes), Buccinum (true whelks), Strombus (true conches), Murex (murex snails), Trochus (top snails), Turbo (turban snails), Helix (terrestrial snails), Neritha (nerites), Haliotis (abalones), Patella (true limpets and brachiopods), Dentalium (tusk shells), Serpula (serpulid worms) *Lithophyta: Tubipora (organ pipe corals), Millepora (fire corals), Madrepora (stone corals) *Zoophyta: Isis (soft corals), Gorgonia (sea fans), Alcyonium (tunicates), Tubularia (Tubularia), Eschara (Bryozoa), Corallina (coralline algae), Sertularia (Bryozoa), Hydra, Pennatula (sea pens), Taenia (tapeworms), Volvox Plants The second volume, published in 1759, detailed the kingdom Plantae, in which Linnaeus included true plants, as well as fungi, algae and lichens. In addition to repeating the species he had previously listed in his Species Plantarum (1753), and those published in the intervening period, Linnaeus described several hundred new plant species. The species from Species Plantarum were numbered sequentially, while the new species were labelled with letters. Many were sent to Linnaeus by his correspondents overseas, including Johannes Burman and David de Gorter in South Africa, Patrick Browne, Philip Miller and John Ellis in America, Jean-Fran√ßois S√©guier, Carlo Allioni and Casimir Christoph Schmidel in the Alps, Gorter and Johann Ernst Hebenstreit in the Orient, and Fran√ßois Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix, Gerard and Barnadet Gabriel across Europe.

It is held in contrast to production for profit. This criterion is used to distinguish socialism from capitalism, and was one of the fundamental defining characteristics of socialism initially shared by Marxian socialists, evolutionary socialists, social anarchists and Christian socialists.\\"Socialism and Capitalism: Are They Qualitatively Different Socioeconomic Systems?\\", by Kotz, David M. Retrieved February 19, 2011, from University of Massachusetts: http://people.umass.edu/dmkotz/Soc_and_Cap_Diff_Syst_06_12.pdf: \\"This understanding of socialism was held not just by revolutionary Marxist socialists but also by evolutionary socialists, Christian socialists, and even anarchists. At that time, there was also wide agreement about the basic institutions of the future socialist system: public ownership instead of private ownership of the means of production, economic planning instead of market forces, production for use instead of for profit.\\" This principle is broad and can refer to an array of different configurations that vary based on the underlying theory of economics employed. In its classic definition, production for use implied an economic system whereby the law of value and law of accumulation no longer directed economic activity, whereby a direct measure of utility and value is used in place of the abstractions of the price system, money, and capital. Alternative conceptions of socialism that don't utilize the profit system such as the Lange model involve the use of a price system and monetary calculation. The central critique of the capitalist profits system by socialists is that the accumulation of capital (\\"making money\\") becomes increasingly detached from the process of producing economic value, leading to waste, inefficiency, and social issues. Essentially, it is a distortion of proper accounting based on the assertion of the law of value instead of the \\"real\\" costs of the factors of production, objectively determined outside of social relations.  Exposition  Production for use refers to an arrangement whereby the production of goods and services is carried out ex ante (directly) for their utility (also called \\"use-value\\"). The implication is that the value of economic output would be based on use- value or a direct measure of utility as opposed to exchange-value; because economic activity would be undertaken to directly satisfy economic demands and human needs, the productive apparatus would directly serve individual and social needs. This is contrasted with production for exchange of the produced good or service in order to profit, where production is subjected to the perpetual accumulation of capital, a condition where production is only undertaken if it generates profit, implying an ex post or indirect means of satisfying economic demand. The profits system is oriented toward generating a profit to be reinvested into the economy (and the constant continuation of this process), the result being that society is structured around the need for a perpetual accumulation of capital.\\"Production for Use\\", The Western Socialist (1967), Vol.36. Retrieved February 19, 2011: http://www.worldsocialism.org/canada/production.for.use.1969.v36n268.htm In contrast, production for use means that the accumulation of capital is not a compulsory driving force in the economy, and by extension, the core process which society and culture revolves around. Production for profit, in contrast, is the dominant mode of production in the modern world system, equivocates \\"profitability\\" and \\"productivity\\" and presumes that the former always equates to the latter. Some thinkers, including the Austrian philosopher and political economist Otto Neurath, have used the phrase \\"socialization\\" to refer to the same concept of \\"production for use\\". In Neurath's phraseology, \\"total socialization\\" involves calculation in kind in place of financial calculation and a system of planning in place of market-based allocation of economic goods. Alternative conceptions exist in the form of market socialism.  Usage  * Karl Marx referred to the \\"production of use-values\\" as a feature of any economic mode of production, but characterized capitalism as a mode of production that subjugated the production of use-value for the self-expansion of capital (i.e., capital accumulation or production for profit). In contrast, socialism was vaguely defined as a system based on the direct production of use-value free of the process of continuous capital accumulation. * Eugene V. Debs popularly used the phrase when running for president of the United States in 1912, stating that capitalism is founded upon production for profit, and in contrast, socialism is postulated upon production for use.Debs, Eugene V. (1912) The Socialist Party‚Äôs Appeal. The Independent * Norman Thomas, a presidential candidate in the United States for the Socialist Party of America in the six elections from 1928 to 1948, contrasted socialism with capitalism by stating that socialism is based on production for use and an end to the profit system.Thomas, Norman (1936) Is the New Deal Socialism?.

Description  Proponents of socialism argue that production for profit (i.e., capitalism) does not always satisfy the economic needs of people, especially the working-class, because capital only invests in production when it is profitable. This fails to satisfy demand, that is the needs of people who lack basic necessities but have insufficient purchasing power to acquire these needs in a manner that would be profitable for businesses. This results in a number of inefficiencies: unsold items are rarely given away to people who need but can‚Äôt afford them, unemployed workers are not utilized to produce such services, and resources are expended on occupations that serve no other purpose than to support the accumulation of profit instead of being utilized to provide useful goods and services.\\"Let's produce for use, not profit\\", Socialist Standard, May 2010. Retrieved August 07, 2010: For example, the United States housing bubble resulted in an overproduction of housing units that could not be sold at a profit, despite there being sufficient demand and need for housing units. Production for use in some form was the historically dominant modality until the initial primitive accumulation of capital. Economic planning is not synonymous with production for use. Planning is essential in modern globalised production both within enterprises and within nation states. Planning to maximize profitability (i.e., within industries and private corporations) or to improve the efficiency of capital accumulation in the capitalist macro- economy (i.e. monetary policy, fiscal policy and industrial policy) does not change the fundamental criteria and need to generate a financial profit to be reinvested into the economy, lest it go into a crisis. A more recent critique of production for profit is that it fails spectacularly to address issues such as externalities which the board and management of a for profit enterprise are often under a fiduciary responsibility to ignore if they harm or conflict with the shareholders' profit motives. = Criticisms of production for profit = Some socialists suggest a number of irrational outcomes occur from capitalism and the need to accumulate capital when capitalist economies reach a point in development whereby investment accumulates at a greater rate than growth of profitable investment opportunities. The central socialist critique of the profits system is that the accumulation of capital becomes further detached from the process of producing economic value, leading to waste, inefficiency and underlying social issues. Advertisement and planned obsolescence are strategies used by businesses to generate demand for the continual consumption required for capitalism to sustain itself, so that instead of satisfying social and individual needs, capitalism first and foremost serves the artificial need for the accumulation of capital. The creation of industries, projects and services comes about for no other purpose than generating profit, economic growth or maintaining employment. The drive to create such industries arises from the need to absorb the savings in the economy, and thus, to maintain the accumulation of capital. This can take the form of corporatization and commercialization of public services, i.e., transforming them into profit-generating industries to absorb investment, or the creation and expansion of sectors of the economy that do not produce any economic value by themselves because they deal only with exchange-related activities, sectors such as financial services. This can contribute to the formation of economic bubbles, crises and recessions.Economic Crisis from a Socialist Perspective. Retrieved June 23, 2011, from rdwolff.com: For socialists, the solution to these problems entails a reorientation of the economic system from production for profit and the need to accumulate capital to a system where production is adjusted to meet individual and social demands directly.  Criticisms of central planning  Socialist and non-socialist opponents of the Soviet model of economic planning have criticized the Soviet centralized model of a planned economy on similar grounds to the critique leveled against capitalism as production was often undertaken in order to fulfill plan targets as opposed to being produced for use.Ellman, Michael (2014) [1989] \\"The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning\\" in Socialist Planning. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. p.23. Quote: \\"In fact, the central authorities are partially ignorant of the situation throughout the economy, and this is a major factor causing such phenomena as the dictatorship over needs, bureaucratization, production for plan rather than use...\\" = Contrasted with state capitalism = As an objective criterion for socialism, production for use can be used to evaluate the socialistic content of the composition of former and existing economic systems. For example, an economic system that is dominated by nationalized firms organized around the production of profit, whether this profit is retained by the firm or paid to the government as a dividend payment, would be a state capitalist economy. In such a system, the organizational structure of the firm remains similar to a private-sector firm; non-financial costs are externalized because profitability is the criterion for production, so that the majority of the economy remains essentially capitalist despite the formal title of public ownership. This has led many socialists to categorize the current Chinese economic system as a capitalist or state-capitalist economy.\\"China - 'Socialist market economy' or just plain capitalism?\\", Retrieved February 19, 2011: http://www.marxist.com/china- socialist-market-economy200106.htm The economy of the Soviet Union was based upon capital accumulation for reinvestment and production for profit; the difference between it and Western capitalism was that the Soviet Union achieved this through nationalized industry and state-directed investment, with the eventual goal of building a socialist society based upon production for use and self-management. Vladimir Lenin described the Soviet economy as \\"state-monopoly capitalism\\"Lenin's Collected Works Vol. 27, p. 293, quoted by Aufheben and did not consider it to be socialism. During the 1965 Liberman Reforms, the Soviet Union re-introduced profitability as a criterion for industrial enterprises. Other views argue the Soviet Union evolved into a non- capitalist and non-socialist system characterized by control and subordination of society by party and government officials who coordinated the economy; this can be called bureaucratic collectivism. = Contrary socialist theories = The concept of production for use has been rejected by some socialists, most notably proponents of market socialism, who argue that socially held enterprises can compete with each other and generate profit in a market economy, with or without addressing the issue of distribution of this profit. Neoclassical economists argue that, under conditions of Pareto optimality, the pursuit of profit leads to a satisfaction of economic demands (the provision of use-values) and that market socialism would be able to achieve this outcome while retaining profitability as the operational criteria for socialist enterprises. In particular, some market socialists justify their position by claiming that society as a whole would control the surplus product (the profit generated by publicly owned firms), which could be used to finance public goods or public investment as opposed to accumulating in the hands of capitalists and shareholders. Many social democrats currently reject this concept altogether and wish to retain the capitalist economic system by promoting a welfare state and economic interventions in order to make capitalism more \\"equitable\\" without questioning the legitimacy of the profits system.  Social production and peer-to-peer processes  Michel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as an emergent alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital. Commons-based peer production generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code. In both cases, production is carried out directly for use - software is produced solely for their use-value.  Valuation and calculation  Multiple forms of valuation have been proposed to govern production in a socialist economy, to serve as a unit of account and to quantify the usefulness of an object in socialism. These include valuations based on labor-time, the expenditure of energy in production, or disaggregated units of physical quantities.\\"The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisited\\" by Nove, Alec. 1991. (P.22) = Physical quantities = The classic formulation of socialism involved replacing the criteria of value from money (exchange-value) to physical utility (use-value), to be quantified in terms of physical quantities (Calculation in kind and Input-Output analysis) or some natural unit of accounting, such as energy accounting.\\"The Alternative to Capitalism\\", World Socialist Party USA. Retrieved March 17, 2011: http://wspus.org/in-depth/the-alternative-to- capitalism/: \\"Wealth in socialism would be produced directly as such, i. e. as useful articles needed for human survival and enjoyment; resources and labour would be allocated for this purpose by conscious decisions, not through the operation of economic laws acting with the same coercive force as laws of nature. Although their effect is similar, the economic laws which come into operation in an exchange economy such as capitalism are not natural laws, since they arise out of a specific set of social relationships existing between human beings.\\" Input-output model analysis is based upon directly determining the physical quantities of goods and services to be produced and allocating economic inputs accordingly; thus production targets are pre- planned.\\"Quantity-Directed Socialism, Socialist Economics\\", Retrieved March 16, 2011: http://www.economictheories.org/2009/06/quantity-directed- socialism.html Soviet economic planning was overwhelmingly focused on material balances - balancing the supply of economic inputs with planned output targets. = Marginal cost = Oskar Lange formulated a mechanism for the direct allocation of capital goods in a socialist economy that was based on the marginal cost of production. Under a capitalist economy, managers of firms are ordered and legally required to base production around profitability, and in theory, competitive pressure creates a downward pressure on profits and forces private businesses to be responsive to demands of consumers, indirectly approximating production for use. In the Lange Model, the firms would be publicly owned and the managers would be tasked with setting the price of output to its marginal cost, thereby achieving pareto efficiency through direct allocation. = Cybernetics = Cybernetics, the use of computers to coordinate production in an optimal fashion, has been suggested for socialist economies. Oskar Lange, rejecting his earlier proposals for market socialism, argued that the computer is more efficient than the market process at solving the multitude of simultaneous equations required for allocating economic inputs efficiently (either in terms of physical quantities or monetary prices).\\"The Computer and the market\\", Lange, Oskar. Retrieved March 16, 2011: http://www.calculemus.org/lect/L-I-MNS/12/ekon-i-modele/lange-comp-market.htm Salvador Allende's socialist-led government developed Project Cybersyn, a form of decentralized economic planning though the experimental computer-led viable system model of computed organisational structure of autonomous operative units though an algedonic feedback setting and bottom-up participative decision-making by the Cyberfolk component. The project was disbanded after the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. = Free market = Based on the perspective that the law of value would continue to operate in a socialist economy, it is argued that a market economy purged of \\"parasitical and wasteful elements\\" in the form of private ownership of the means of production and the distortions that arise from the concentration of power and wealth in a class of capitalists would enable the market to operate efficiently without distortions. Simply replacing the antagonistic interests between capitalists and workers in enterprises would alter the orientation of the economy from private profit to meeting the demands of the community as firms would seek to maximize the benefits to the member-workers, who would as a whole comprise society. Cooperative economist Jaroslav Vanek suggests that worker self- management and cooperative ownership of enterprises operating in a free-market would allow for a genuine free-market economy free of the market-distorting, monopolistic tendencies and antagonistic interests that emerge from private ownership over production.Perkins, Albert (ndg) \\"Cooperative Economics: An Interview with Jaroslav Vanek\\" New Renaissance magazine, v.5 n.1 Retrieved March 17, 2011  In popular culture  In the Howard Hawks-directed 1940 film His Girl Friday, written by Charles Lederer based on the 1928 Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) interviews accused killer Earl Williams (John Qualen) in jail to write his story for her newspaper. Williams is despondent and confused, and easily accepts it when Johnson leads him into an account of the events preceding the killing, which revolves around the desperate out-of-work man's hearing the expression \\"production for use\\" and transferring the concept in his mind to the gun he had: it was made for use, and he used it. This is the story about Williams that Johnson writes up, to the admiration of the other reporters covering the case. This version of Earl Williams' motivations differs significantly from that presented in the original stage play and the first film adaptation of it from 1931. In those scripts, the killer was a committed anarchist who had definite political reasons for the shooting, and did not need to be influenced by a stronger personality into a false narrative.Jukiƒá, Tatjana (May 18, 2016) \\"The Awful Truth: On Metonymic Ratonality in Hawks and Cavell\\"  See also  * Calculation in kind * Capital accumulation * Economic planning * Lange model * Law of value * Market failure * Mode of production * Planned obsolescence * Post-capitalism * Socialist calculation debate * Socialist economics * Socialist critique of capitalism * Socialist mode of production * Socialization (economics) * Technocracy movement * Time-based currency * Use-value  References   Further reading  * Loeb, Harold (1936).

Biography  Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the youth moved with his family to Nashville, Tennessee and then to Monmouth, Illinois where his father, George Martin, was a Monmouth College biology professor. As a Monmouth College freshman, he drew frogs, grasshoppers and salamanders in his father's biology classes. He met and married Mary Armsby while attending Monmouth College. (Two of their three daughters also went to Monmouth.) Martin left his junior year to study at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, joining Newspaper Enterprise Association in 1921 as a cartoonist.University of Missouri: MU Libraries Special Collections Retrieved October 18, 2015Reynolds, Moira Davidson. Comic Strip Artists in American Newspapers, 1945-1980. McFarland, 2003. =Boots and Her Buddies= While working in NEA's art department, Martin experimented with several strips: Efficiency Ed, Fables of 1921, Taken from Life and Girls, the strip which introduced Boots. In 1924, NEA was looking for a girl strip, and several artists who had previously submitted strips were asked to resubmit them. Martin's sample was unsigned. When an editor examined Martin's strip and asked, \\"How soon can we get this artist?\\", the art director responded, \\"In one minute. He works here.\\" Thus, Girls became Boots and Her Buddies on February 18, 1924, although some newspapers continued to use the first title. Syndicated by NEA, it appeared in 500 newspapers during the 1940s, with about half that carrying the Sunday strip. In the post-WWII years, the figure climbed to 700 newspapers. With the strip's emphasis on fashion and beauty, Martin attended style shows and constantly thumbed through fashion magazines to study trends and keep Boots in current fashions. In addition to the strip, Martin drew promotional paper dolls in occasional newspaper cartoon panels displaying Boots and her fashionable outfits. Promoted as an expert of female beauty, Martin was often invited to judge beauty contests. In the early days, the strip had a large following among students at colleges and high schools, with the result that Martin sometimes made personal appearances at proms.Cochran, Hal. \\"Boots Celetrates Her 25th Anniversary\\". Statesville Daily Record, February 21, 1949. Interviewed in 1952, Martin revealed the strip's background and his attitude toward the characters: Martin's assistant Les Carroll eventually took over the Sunday strip, but Martin continued to draw the daily strip.

Tiffany Fellowship to travel to England and study with master stained glass artist, Patrick Reyntiens at the Burleighfield House Trust in Buckinghampshire. When King returned, he became involved with the craft art movement of the mid-1970s. His work has been exhibited internationally since 1976, in the United States, Europe and Asia. Major permanent installations of his work have been commissioned throughout the United States and abroad.

His repertoire of materials expanded to include holographic and laser-etched, light-responsive laminate films, and he mastered the use of advanced 3-D computer technology facilitating the elaborate engineering of his sculptures. His unique tectonic, site-specific works are in demand by universities, municipal art commissions and corporations around the world. Sculpting with light King's art draws upon principles of sacred geometry to render three-dimensional shapes and patterns found in nature.

As a wrestler, he traveled throughout the world during the 1960s and 1970s, often visiting countries where professional wrestling was unknown such as southeast Asia, and was one of the top competitors to come from New Zealand during that era. Rickard was a frequent opponent for many foreign wrestlers travelling overseas including NWA World Heavyweight Champions such as Jack Brisco, Dory Funk Jr., Harley Race and \\"The Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair. He also had high-profile matches with Karl Gotch, Killer Kowalski, The Destroyer, Andr√© the Giant, Abe Jacobs and King Kong as well. He was a former NWA Australasian Heavyweight Champion, a 3-time NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Champion, and a record 8-time NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Champion. He and Mark Lewin were also the first NWA Australasian Tag Team Champions in the early 1980s. Rickard is considered one of the most influential figures in New Zealand professional wrestling in the latter half of the 20th century. He took over the Dominion Wrestling Union after the death of founder Walter Miller in 1959 and ran it for two years. In 1962, he established All Star Pro Wrestling, also known as NWA New Zealand internationally, which eventually succeeded the DWU and remained the country's single major promotion for the next 30 years. He and Australian promoter Jim Barnett were responsible for bringing foreign wrestlers, especially from Canada and the United States, back to the Pacific region by the late 1960s. He was also the creator of On the Mat, one of the country's longest running sports programmes from 1975 to 1984, and its short- lived spin-off The Main Event in 1990. Rickard was also a successful hotelier and businessman before and after his wrestling career, most notably, establishing one of the first gyms in Wellington and running the Hutt Park Hotel for 15 years. After his in-ring retirement in 1989, he remained involved in the wrestling industry. He served as President of the NWA during the early to mid-1990s first shared between himself, Howard Brody, Dennis Coralluzzo and Jim Crockett Jr. from 1993 to 1995, and alone from 1995 to 1996. He was also a one-time a director of the Cauliflower Alley Club and honoured by the organisation in 1997. Early life and amateur career Steve Rickard, born Sydney Mervin \\"Merv\\" Batt, grew up in Napier, New Zealand. He joined an amateur wrestling club at age 14, and left school that same year to work three jobs to help support his mother and younger brother Eddy and sister Val As a young man, he joined the national police force in Napier and later transferred to Wellington where he worked as a police detective with the Criminal Investigation Branch. He eventually left the police force and bought the Hutt Park Hotel which he owned for the next 15 years. Rickard started competing as an amateur wrestler in Napier during the 1940s, wrestling in the national championships New Zealand wide, and later began training wrestlers himself. According to Rickard, he \\"used to train the wrestlers and get some place or another where you could put a mat down\\" before building his own facility though \\"the conditions generally were not very good at all\\". Rickard continued his training in Wellington and eventually opened one of the city's first gyms on Cuba Street. Professional career =Early career as a world journeyman= Rickard was wrestling on the amateur circuit with Ricky Walsh during this time and it was he who convinced Rickard to begin wrestling professionally. He began wrestling for local promoters in Wellington including shows for wrestler Al Hobman. In 1963, Rickard won his first major title when he defeated Hobman for the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship. He briefly lost it to Peter Maivia in Auckland on 3 August 1964, but regained it in Wellington three days later. Rickard re-lost the title to Hobman later that year. On the advice of Ricky Wallace, he later began travelling overseas. His first international tour was to Australia and then shortly afterwards went on to New Caledonia, Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, and Hawaii. He also wrestled throughout Canada and the United States early in his career. During the next two decades, Rickard's professional wrestling career would take him to countries throughout the world and many were where in places where professional wrestling had never been promoted before; he would make numerous trips to Australia and Singapore, and wrestle in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India and most of the major Pacific Islands including New Hebrides, Western Samoa, American Samoa, Tahiti and Hawaii. He eventually became one of the top wrestlers to compete internationally during the 1960s and 70s and often faced many prominent stars of the era. He was the opponent of many NWA World Heavyweight Champions in bouts outside North America, such as Jack Brisco and Dory Funk Jr., and was also involved in high-profile matches with The Destroyer, Andr√© the Giant, Abe Jacobs and King Kong, the latter billed as \\"the uncrowned Heavyweight Champion of the World\\". His bouts in Australia against Killer Kowalski were called \\"real blood baths\\". He also wrestled Karl Gotch while touring Canada in 1965 and publicly praised his scientific abilities afterwards as \\"a true wrestler with all the science that we are led to believe the greats of earlier generations possessed ‚Äì men like Jim Londos, Dick Shikat, Stan Zbyszko and others\\". =Singapore and the Jakarta airport riot= In July 1969, he accompanied the Japanese Wrestling Association on its tour of Southeast Asia. He teamed with Kurt von Stroheim, a tag team champion in the United States and Australia with his brother Karl, and lost to Giant Baba & Antonio Inoki in both their encounters in Singapore and Hong Kong. On the second day of the tour, on 15 July, he and von Stroheim wrestled Giant Baba & Michiaki Yoshimura at Victoria City's South China Stadium in front of 5,000 fans. Four months later in Tokyo, approximately 8,500 were in attendance when Rickard fought to a double-countout with Kantaro Hoshino at the Sumo Hall. That same year, while wrestling out of Singapore, Rickard was visiting the Indonesian capital of Jakarta with several other wrestlers. While arriving at an airport, he and two other wrestlers, King Kong and Mr. X, started a brawl with Shintaro Fuji, Jack Claybourne, and Charlie Londos. The local populace was unfamiliar with professional wrestling at the time and when Jack Claybourne, a French-speaking African from Martinique, was seen being attacked by masked wrestler Mr. X it was presumed to be a racially motivated assault. As the country was then under control of the military, truckloads of soldiers were called in and soon arrived the airport. All six wrestlers fled to the runway where Rickard flagged down a small plane getting ready to take off. Boarding the plane, the pilot refused to take off until the soldiers began firing and one of the bullets went through the plane's fuselage. Flying back to Singapore, a friend gave Mr. X a newspaper cutting with a picture of the airport brawl. The headline read \\"Steve Rickard and Ku Klux Klan gangsters from Australia in racial attack at airport\\". Rickard and the other wrestlers were allowed to reenter the country to appear for their match after local promoter Ranjid Singh offered a \\"sweetener\\" during a meeting with military leaders. Rickard was involved in other incidents during his international travels. He was riding a train in India when it was bombed in a terrorist attack. He was also once stranded in Greece when the government closed down the country's airports during trouble with Turkey. =Touring India as Young Kong= Rickard later became a close friend of King Kong and who later asked him to take his place in a tour of India in early 1970. Kong also asked Rickard to use his name, wrestling as his kayfabe \\"son\\" Young Kong, which was considered a great honour at the time given Kong's legendary reputation throughout Asia at the time and Rickard's bouts in India drew thousands of people. At one point, at a show in Zijayawada, he was the only non-Indian wrestler booked for the event and many of the local Indian wrestlers were favored by the crowd. Rickard was scheduled to face Tiger Sucha Singh, a top star in the area at the time, and defeated him after 50 minutes. Fans charged the ring almost immediately after the bout, but instead of reacting violently, they \\"hoisted on their shoulders and carried from the ring\\". Returning to Singapore after the tour, Rickard visited King Kong in hospital two days before his death on 16 May 1970. The next day at his funeral, he served as King Kong's pallbearer along with five other wrestlers. That same year, Rickard was profiled by Fight Times Magazine and which claimed that he was \\"rapidly becoming known as the greatest globetrotter in wrestling\\". At the time of the article, he was on a tour in Australia and was to travel to Japan and then return to New Zealand via the United States and Hawaii. Rickard had wrestled in the US earlier in his career and had a brief stint in the Carolinas where he teamed with fellow New Zealander Abe Jacobs before returning to Singapore choosing to honour a prior commitment with local promoters there by opening for them in their new season. While wrestling for Frank Tunney and Maple Leaf Wrestling, he faced Giant Jean Ferre in front of 14,000 people at the Maple Leaf Gardens on 14 November 1971. =All Star Pro Wrestling= When not competing internationally, he also wrestled in his native New Zealand, where he became a mainstay for the country's main promotion, the Dominion Wrestling Union, for longtime promoter Walter Miller. After Miller's death in 1959, Rickard ran the DWU before forming his own promotion, All Star Pro Wrestling, three years later. Although he would only run cards on and off during the next few years, Rickard's organisation would eventually succeed the DWU as the country's single major wrestling promotion for the next 30 years. Walter's death caused a decline in wrestling, not only in New Zealand, but for the entire Australasian region as appearances from foreign wrestlers declined to only a few each year. Rickard and John da Silva, who ran the rival Central Wrestling Alliance, sought to develop their own stars during early to mid-1960s such as Al Hobman, Tony Garea, Peter Maivia,Solomon, Brian. WWE Legends. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2006. (pg. 142‚Äì143, 145, 162, 195‚Äì196, 199) and The Sheepherders.Myers, Robert. The Professional Wrestling Trivia Book. Boston: Branden Books, 1999. (pg. 58) He and fellow wrestler Joe Komone also discovered future Australian heavyweight champion Earl Black and who spent his rookie year for Rickard in Wellington before going to work for Australian promoters Hal Morgan and Jim Barnett in Sydney. Eventually, he and Jim Barnett of World Championship Wrestling in Australia were able to work together to bring back foreign wrestlers to the Pacific within a few years. By the late 1960s, New Zealand was being regularly visited by Australian wrestlers Ron Miller and Larry O'Day of Barnett's World Championship Wrestling, Robert Bruce from Scotland, Canadians Gordon Nelson and George Gordienko, and French wrestler Andr√© the Giant.Krugman, Michael. Andr√© the Giant: A Legendary Life. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2009. (pg. 7) In 1972, he helped book one of the biggest tours to date when US wrestlers Big Bad John, Bulldog Brower, Les Wolff, King Curtis Iaukea, Spiros Arion, Mark Lewin, Thunderbolt Patterson, Sweet Daddy Siki, Tarzan Tyler, Dewey Robertson and Haystacks Calhoun wrestled throughout the country. The American wrestlers proved very popular with the public and a few, such as Calhoun and his wife, were featured in the national media. In 1972, Rickard's partnership with Jim Barnett ended when Barnett sold his share of Big Time Wrestling and went back to the United States. By this time, Rickard had decided to promote All Star Pro-Wrestling full-time in New Zealand as live events were proving extremely popular. His shows sold out the Wellington Winter Show Buildings ten weeks in a row and often had to turn away hundreds of spectators. On one occasion, Rickard had to rescue his wife from angry fans who, when told the show had sold out, began rocking the small ticket booth. Many wrestlers from throughout the world, especially from Canada and the United States, would come to wrestle for Rickard's All Star Pro-Wrestling for the next decade. Not only were these some of the top wrestlers of the NWA at the time but younger wrestlers as well. Rick Martel made one of his first international tours for Rickard in 1974 and later became a major star for his promotion. =On the Mat= Rickard's success with All Star Pro-Wrestling encouraged him to capitalize on this popularity with a nationally broadcast wrestling program. He had seen how successful televised wrestling had been in Australia and in the United States, and with Jim Barnett was involved with airing the short-lived Big Time Wrestling in 1972. Similar to Britain's World of Sport, the program was to showcase both the country's top wrestlers and international stars of the period. He used footage taken from one of his earlier events at the Wellington Winter Show Buildings had a film pilot made which he used to \\"pitch\\" the idea to TV1 but it passed on the show. Rickard had to wait two years until the founding of a second network, TV2, which was more favourable to the idea of a wrestling program. After meeting with then programme director Kevan Moore, Rickard developed the show with South Pacific Pictures. The first episode of On the Mat premiered in 1975, with Ernie Leonard and Rickard as the play-by- play announcer, and was an instant success. It remained on the air for 9 years, being broadcast in several countries, and became New Zealand's longest- running sports show. During the show's off-season, he and the All Star Pro- Wrestlers spent the three months wrestling overseas touring the Middle East, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Hawaii. Rickard often stepped out of his role as announcer and actively competed on the show. On 22 June 1978, he defeated Toru Tanaka for the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Champions. He and Tanaka traded the belt twice in a two- month period and Rickard went on to hold the title a record 8-times in the next five years. Rickard also started promoting outside New Zealand, purchasing the 50th State Big Time Wrestling territory in Hawaii from Ed Francis. In June 1979, he began holding weekly matches at Block Arena in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and monthly events at the Blaisdell Center Arena in downtown Honolulu. He had a television contract with KGMB-TV, retaining Lord Blears as his announcer, and featured Rick Martel, Siva Afi, \\"Pretty Boy\\" Larry Sharpe, Don Muraco, Rocky Johnson, Billy White Wolf, Karl von Steiger, Ripper Collins and other NWA stars. He also used many of his own wrestlers such as The Sheepherders and, based partly on their television appearances, were seen by US promoters and eventually brought to the United States. He sold his territorial rights in Hawaii to Peter Maivia a year later. He also continued wrestling in New Zealand during this time meeting NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race in Hamilton on 11 September 1979, and defeating the world champion via disqualification, and teaming with Rick Martel to defeat Mr. Fuji & Casey Mille in Auckland a month later. His two sons, Ricky and Tony Rickard, were trained by Rickard and also involved in the promotion and sometimes featured in its storylines. In 1981, Steve Rickard feuded with Larry O'Day over the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship after O'Day broke the leg of one of his sons. Ricky Rickard, though his career was brief, became an accomplished wrestler in his own right by capturing his father's title from Butcher Brannigan two years later. On one occasion, unrelated to an ongoing storyline, Ricky was wrestling in a tag team match refereed by his brother Tony and commentated by their father. On 8 October 1981, he and Mark Lewin were awarded the NWA Australasian Tag Team Championship and held the titles for nearly seven months. Though they lost the titles to King Kamaka & Baron Von Krupp in Auckland the following year, they regained the titles on 27 May 1982. Their second and final reign lasted two months and ended when they were beaten by King Kamaka & Ox Baker on 19 August. Though foreign stars, especially from the US, were becoming harder to find by the early 1980s, Rickard was able to bring in Harley Race, Abdullah the Butcher and \\"The Original Sheik\\" Ed Farhat as well as younger wrestlers such as Bret Hart and Barry Darsow. Darsow, who wrestled as Mongol Zar, later defeated him for the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship in 1983 but quickly regained it. That same year, the 54-year-old Rickard won the national championship from Siva Afi and vacated shortly afterwards. It had been twenty years since he had last held the title. Also, on 4 March 1983, he fought \\"The Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Hamilton, New Zealand. The poor New Zealand economy, as well as the decline of the NWA in the face of the national expansion of the World Wrestling Federation, made importing foreign wrestlers extremely difficult and finally Rickard could no longer afford to produce the show and was forced to cancel On the Mat by 1984. =Later career and retirement= As a member of the National Wrestling Alliance, Rickard was involved in arranging title defences in the Australasian region for NWA World champions during the 1970s and 80s. He was responsible for the unsanctioned title switch between Ric Flair and Harley Race at the Wellington Town Hall on 21 March 1984, and in Geylang, Singapore three days later. Race, who had been friends with Rickard for many years, agreed to this in an attempt to help revive wrestling in Australasia then in decline. Flair also went along with it later commenting \\"If Harley Race OK'd it, it was hard for anyone to tell them different\\". It has been worked out a \\"backroom deal\\", mostly to keep it a secret from wrestling \\"dirt sheets\\" such as the Wrestling Observer, however the NWA objected to being left out of the planning and refused to recognize these title changes for several years. After the cancellation of On the Mat, Rickard continued to promote shows with All Star Pro-Wrestling and attempted several international tours. In the mid-1980s, he spent time in NWA Hawaii where he defended the Commonwealth title against Larry O'Day and Lars Anderson. He also teamed with his son Tony against Larry O'Day & Ripper Collins in a best 2-of-3 falls match for the NWA Australasian Tag Team titles. Rickard retired from active competition in 1989, shortly before his 60th birthday, as a result of a series of injuries sustained during his career. He underwent surgery to have had both his hips and knees replaced, and an untreated shoulder dislocation sustained during an overseas tour would continue to trouble him for many years. =The Main Event and NWA= In 1990, Rickard attempted another wrestling program called \\"The Main Event\\" which aired on TV3. Like On the Mat, the show featured local New Zealand talent as well as international wrestlers such as the Mongolian Mauler, the Russian Brute, The Russian Brute, Lou Perez, The Bull, The Terminator, and The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs & Jerry Sags). The main star, however, was Siva Afi who won the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship from Canadian Stockman in Auckland on 13 July 1990. Although Rickard had a less active role in the show outside his duties as announcer he had a small role in its storylines. While serving as the guest ring announcer for a championship tournament in 1991, for example, he was attacked the Mongolian Mauler after losing to Siva Afi in the finals. The program was unable to match the ratings of its rival on TV2 (New Zealand), WWF Superstars of Wrestling, and was cancelled after 11 episodes. Though All Star Pro-Wrestling ceased promoting shortly after the cancellation of the show, Rickard remained a member of the NWA up until the mid-1990s. In 1994, he reappeared in NWA Hawaii where he wrestled Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler, with Brian Christopher in his corner, at the Honolulu Stadium. He also served as president of the organisation, along with Howard Brody, Dennis Coralluzzo and Jim Crockett, Jr. from 1993 to 1995, and then alone until 1996. He was also involved with the Cauliflower Alley Club, a professional wrestling and boxing fraternal society, and was on the board of directors at one time; he became an official honouree of the organisation in 1997. He continued promoting wrestling events into the 21st century running occasional events in southeast Asia. On 12 December 2004, he organised a show at the Singapore Indoor Stadium featuring the first steel cage match held in Singapore in over a decade and headlined by Dusty Wolfe, The Honky Tonk Man, Warlord and The Barbarian. Later years In the years following his retirement, Rickard has been recognized by the national media for his contributions to professional wrestling in New Zealand. He has been referred to as \\"the Vince McMahon of New Zealand wrestling\\" by the New Zealand Herald and credited as \\"the man who turned wrestling into home entertainment\\" with his On the Mat program. He has also received praise from the internet wrestling community being called \\"one of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers\\" by the Pro Wrestling Torch. In June 2007, Rickard was interviewed by KiwiProWrestling.co.nz where he reflected on his amateur and professional career. On 13 June 2008, Rickard visited Kiwi Pro Wrestling's \\"Wild 4 Wrestling\\" training facility where he met with KPW CEO Rip Morgan, \\"Irishman\\" Mike Ryan and several of its students, most notably, Max \\"the Axe\\" Damage. In early 2009, he and his wife Lorraine left their home of 30 years in Oriental Bay and moved into a retirement home in Greenmeadows outside his birthplace of Napier. On 3 September 2009, Rickard celebrated his 80th birthday in Hawke's Bay which was attended by around 100 guests including former wrestlers Arthur Sneddon and Joe Fau. The event was covered by the New Zealand Herald. Two months later, he was interviewed for A Kiwi Century On the Mat, an upcoming historical documentary on professional wrestling in New Zealand, a year later. That same year, Dave Cameron of Fight Times Magazine ranked him #4 of a top ten listing of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers. The New Zealand Herald included Rickard in its list of New Zealand's favourite wrestlers as did the Herald columnist Chris Rattue in his own top ten list. He died on 5 April 2015 in Queensland, Australia.http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/270474/nz-wrestling-great- dies Championships and accomplishments *All Star Pro Wrestling **NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship (New Zealand version) (8 times) **NWA Australasian Tag Team Championship (2 times, first) ‚Äì with Mark Lewin *Cauliflower Alley Club **Other inductee (1997) *National Wrestling Alliance **National ***NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship (3 times) **Regional ***NWA Australasian Heavyweight Championship (1 time) References Further reading *Flair, Ric.

We can place the Guarding Angel project, first executed in baked clay and in a smaller form in 1990, into a larger family of works: Prayer (metal, 1991) and Sound of Sadness (baked clay, 1992). The \\"simplicity as a resolved complexity\\" Brancusi is an important key for the understanding of these works. ...for the monument to Mihai Eminescu, Tudor Cataraga selects only abstract principles, imagining a \\"cosmic\\" portrait of the national genius. Far more modern in visual expression, the sculptor is now free to play with three-dimensional elements and he conceives a rhythmical network that concentrates in the poet's figure /symbolic nucleus, without stirring the space, but comprimating. This second direction of his research, his playing with neo-expressionist forms can be seen in a series of his recent experimental works: The Woman-Crossbow (bronze, wood, 1994), The Man-Bird (bronze, granite, 1994), Motherhood (bronze, granite, 1998). Underwater object (metal 1998) Tenacious in his research leading him from deductive to inductive thinking, without any disruption from his way, the sculptor's interest is gradually sliding to architectural constructions, and constructivism. The ever more pregnant abstract trend, the play with geometrical modules epitomise his fascination with the assemblage and with the rich relation \\"entity-detail\\": Genesis (wood, metal, 2000), Masterpiece (wood, metal, 2000). Tudor Cataraga, in his full artistic maturity, has the energy and the firm gesture of an inquisitive and attentive sculptor\\".

There are many opinions as to what constitutes a good citizen. Theodore Roosevelt said, \\"The first requisite of a good citizen in this Republic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his own weight; that he shall not be a mere passenger, but shall do his share in the work that each generation of us finds ready to hand; and, furthermore, that in doing his work he shall show, not only the capacity for sturdy self-help, but also self-respecting regard for the rights of others.\\"Theodore Roosevelt, Speech at New York (1902-11-11) Education is sometimes viewed as a prerequisite to good citizenship, in that it helps citizens make good decisions and deal with demagogues who would delude them. Roger Soder writes that in a democracy, where the demands of good citizenship are placed upon all, \\"only the common schools can provide to all the education that all need.\\" Science literacy is also frequently touted as a key to good citizenship. Good citizenship is sometimes viewed as requiring both intellectual skills (such as critical thinking) and participatory skills (such as deliberating civilly, monitoring the government, building coalitions, managing conflict peacefully and fairly, and petitioning, speaking or testifying before public bodies). Henry David Thoreau wrote that men who serve the state making \\"no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense...are commonly esteemed good citizens.\\" Orit Ichilov notes that children \\"tend to perceive the government in the image of an ideal father that is benevolent and protective. At this stage, the good citizen is characterized as one who, through his behavior, proves himself one worthy of the love and protection of the government rather than one possessing certain political obligations and rights.\\" Through their early school years, children usually continue to think in apolitical terms of their citizenship, expressing loyalty by their dedeath to all main in their country due to an attachment to its beauty, wildlife, and good people. By age twelve or thirteen, they begin referring more to political qualities, such as the nature and values of the regime. High school seniors define the good citizen primarily in political terms. Some students define good citizenship in terms of standing up for what one believes in. Joel Westheimer identifies the personally responsible citizen (who acts responsibly in his community, e.g. by donating blood), the participatory citizen (who is an active member of community organizations and/or improvement efforts) and the justice-oriented citizen (who critically assesses social, political, and economic structures to see beyond surface causes) as three different types of \\"good citizen.\\" Sometimes incentives prevail over desires to be a good citizen. For example, many people will avoid coming forth as witnesses in court cases because they do not want to deal with the inconvenience and red tape. Aristotle makes a distinction between the good citizen and the good man, writing, \\"...there cannot be a single absolute excellence of the good citizen. But the good man is so called in virtue of a single absolute excellence. It is thus clear that it is possible to be a good citizen without possessing the excellence which is the quality of a good man.\\" Specifically, in his view, the good citizen is measured in relation to ruling and being ruled, the good man only in ruling. Some of the ambiguity is likely due to more than one Greek word being translated \\"good.\\" Many organizations attempt to promote \\"good citizenship.\\" For example, the Boy Scouts of America published Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship, and the Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship is given to those who are deemed to have made outstanding contributions to the well being of their communities without expectation of remuneration or reward. Another non-profit organization, Good Citizen, has a mission to teach Americans how to be effective citizens and focuses on 100 citizen actions.

Formed at Sevilla, he represented four other clubs in La Liga as well as having brief stints in England and Italy. Club career =Sevilla= Born in Son Servera, Majorca, Luna finished his youth career in Andalusia with Sevilla FC, making his senior debut with the reserve side in Segunda Divisi√≥n B. On 15 and 19 May 2010, he appeared in his first two official games with the first team, and both were decisive ones: in the first he played the full 90 minutes as his team won 3‚Äì2 away against UD Almer√≠a in the last round, finally edging RCD Mallorca for the last qualification position for the UEFA Champions League. The second was a 2‚Äì0 triumph over Atl√©tico Madrid in the final of the Copa del Rey, again playing the full match. On 19 January 2011, Luna was loaned to neighbouring Almer√≠a until the end of the campaign. He was regularly utilised, as the club suffered top flight relegation after a four-year stay. After returning to Sevilla, Luna played 14 league matches in 2011‚Äì12, his first full season. He scored his first goal as a professional in a 1‚Äì2 away defeat on 29 January 2012 against M√°laga CF, playing as a left midfielder. On 25 November 2012, Luna was sent off despite being an unused substitute in a 0‚Äì4 loss at Atl√©tico Madrid, in which his teammates Federico Fazio and Ivan Rakitiƒá were also dismissed. He spent the second half of the 2012‚Äì13 season on loan to Mallorca in his native Balearic Islands, eventually meeting the same fate as with Almer√≠a. =Aston Villa= On 20 June 2013, Aston Villa announced the signing of Luna on a three-year deal. He started and scored on his Premier League debut with the club, a 3‚Äì1 win at Arsenal on 17 August. On 5 August 2014, Luna was loaned to Serie A club Hellas Verona F.C. in a season-long loan. In February of the following year, having not made a single appearance, he was loaned to Spezia Calcio in Serie B for the second half of the campaign. In only his second match for his new team, he was sent off in a 3‚Äì2 home win over Modena FC. =Eibar= On 9 July 2015, Luna signed a two-year deal with SD Eibar after terminating his contract with Aston Villa. He made his debut for the Basques on 24 August, assisting goals by Adri√°n and Gonzalo Escalante as they began the new top flight season with a 3‚Äì1 win at Granada CF. In October 2016, Luna and teammate Sergi Enrich apologised when a sex tape involving them and a woman went viral on the Internet. He totalled 46 appearances in his two seasons at the club, scoring in a 3‚Äì2 win at Sporting de Gij√≥n the following 15 January. =Levante= On 11 June 2017, Luna signed a four-year contract with newly promoted side Levante UD. On 29 August 2019, he was loaned to Segunda Divisi√≥n's Rayo Vallecano for one year. On 29 September 2020, Luna terminated his contract with the club. =Girona= On 30 September 2020, Luna agreed to a one-year contract with Girona FC in the second division. In popular culture Aston Villa fans nicknamed Luna 'Tony Moon', a direct translation of his name from Spanish into English. Manager Paul Lambert admitted that he did not understand the nickname. Luna was referenced in the 19th Jack Reacher novel Personal by Lee Child, an Aston Villa fan. There, character Casey Nice described him as a friend of hers, adding \\"I call him Tony Moon\\".

Such exhibitions were often the bases for public fairs, which would involve outdoor entertainment activities, market trading, and misemono. In the period from 1654 to 1868, in Edo city there were 1566 kaich≈ç. Kaich≈ç literally means \\"the opening of the curtain\\", and the purpose of keeping such icons hidden from public view except on special occasions was twofold. First, it upheld the sanctity of the objects that were displayed, where making them viewable to the public all of the time would otherwise serve to devalue their religious impacts. Second, it served as both advertisement and as a fund- raiser for the temple ‚Äî primarily, but not solely, to pay for building repair. Accounts of such kaich≈ç being held in Kamakura and Kyoto can be found dating from before the Edo period, but they only became truly popular during the 17th century. The occurrence of kaich≈ç outside of temple grounds were primarily an Edo city phenomenon. The first such exterior kaich≈ç in Edo was in 1676. Many kaich≈ç were also degaich≈ç, where the activities broadened into the opening of an entire area of the temple, turning it into a form of carnival, with entertainments, food vendors, and even freak shows, or with the religious objects being transported on a tour around the country. Technically, a degaich≈ç is a kaich≈ç outwith temple grounds, and an igaich≈ç is a kaich≈ç where the display is within temple grounds. In theory, attendance at a kaich≈ç was free of charge. In practice, attendees were expected to pay a fee upon entry, and to donate an extra gratuity upon viewing the object displayed. A kaich≈ç would create an economic boom for the businesses around the temple, and were widely advertised and promoted. Kaich≈ç were organized with the permission of the state. Much of the information on the kaich≈ç in Edo, for example, is recorded in Buk≈ç nenpy≈ç, a diary kept by Edo Kanda town official Sait≈ç Gesshin, and in the Kaich≈ç sashi yuyushich≈ç, the bakufu record of the government-approved kaich≈ç. Bakufu approval for degaich≈ç comprised a meeting of the bakufu officials to assess the fundraising case for the proposed kaich≈ç, which would grant permission for a kaich≈ç lasting up to 60 days from the date that the approval was granted. Much of this regulation was imposed in order to eliminate competition for business. However, state regulation was not entirely motivated by this. Although the bakufu in Edo in the 18th century granted only five permits per season, limited to a maximum of sixty days, it was readily prepared to grant extensions to length and to grant special permits. The government saw kaich≈ç as a means for combatting its budget deficit, by eliminating the grants that it had theretofore provided to temples in favour of temples organizing kaich≈ç to raise their own funds. The association of kaich≈ç with non-religious activities, and the secularization of the event, led to the name becoming a slang appellation, in 19th century Edo, for any activity where a person indulged in revelry and frolics in an unusual or inappropriate place, or, further, for a crowd caught up with gambling fever or a person lost the heat of sexual passion.

It is based on a play by Monckton Hoffe. A sombre, bleak film, Daybreak was filmed in 1946, but ran into trouble with the BBFC, resulting in a delay of almost two years before its release. The version finally approved for release excised approximately six minutes of original footage, resulting in some jerky cuts where scenes have been removed and leaving noticeable plot lacunae which are considered to detract somewhat from an otherwise well- regarded film.Daybreak (1948) profile by Cave, Dylan. BFI Screen Online; retrieved 08-08-2010. Plot The story begins with a hangman breaking down when faced with carrying out his last execution of a condemned man before retiring. The hangman begins to tell his story to the governor and the majority of the plot is then played out in the form of an extended flashback ‚Äì although many scenes take place in which the supposed narrator is not actually present. Eddie Mendosa (Portman) owns a London barber's shop in Gravesend and leads an apparently normal life. However, he has a second role, known to no one but his assistant, Ron (Bill Owen) - he is, in fact, England's official public hangmen, called on periodically to travel to prisons around the country to perform executions. He changes his life by making a claim against the estate of Mr Tribe, a barge owner on the Thames. He claims to be his son but has no papers whatsoever to back this claim. One of his father's barge friends is happy to identify Eddie for the price of a few drinks. The solicitor seems happy with this and he inherits 15 barges and a deal of money. One evening, Eddie goes into his local public house for a drink and a bite to eat and is kind to a stranger who comes in to shelter from the heavy rain. This is the bedraggled Frances who likes to be called Frankie (Todd), who is waiting for a bus to take her to a new job at a nightclub. Although Frankie never says a word about her past, there are implications that she has some kind of shady history, and may even have been a prostitute. [Note: It has been surmised that some of the deleted footage may have made this more explicit.] The pair fall in love and only then does she ask his surname. He is obliged to say Tribe as it is the name on the barge. They are soon married, and he hands over the barber's shop to Ron and assumes control of the business, setting up home with Frankie on one of the barges, at her request. Eddie hires a Danish seaman, Olaf (Reed), to work for him, and the arrogant Olaf loses no time in openly flirting with Frankie. Although somewhat attracted to him, she tries her best to deny these feelings and be the loving and dutiful wife. This, however, is made more difficult by the fact that Eddie is forced to travel to other towns from time to time for two or three days at a time to fulfil his prison-service obligations and as he does not wish to come clean about these he tells Frankie that he must attend important business meetings, leaving her to increasingly struggle to rebuff Olaf's advances. When Eddie is next called away, Frankie begs him to either not go or take her with him, but as neither is an option for Eddie, she is left alone and pleads with elderly bargeman, Bill Shackle (Edward Rigby), to stay with her that evening. Shackle is unable to grant her request due to other commitments and Olaf is quick to make himself at home in the cabin and begin drinking. As a condemned man has been given a reprieve, Eddie returns unexpectedly and discovers Frankie and Olaf in this compromising situation. A fight ensues between the two men, during which Eddie is knocked overboard and fails to resurface. The police arrive and Olaf is arrested for murder, as it is presumed that Eddie's body has been carried away by the tide. In despair, Frankie commits suicide by shooting herself. However, Eddie manages to crawl ashore the next morning and goes to his barber shop to clean himself up. It is unclear how he spent the whole night in the Thames. Ron is unaware of Eddy's alter ego as Tribe (or his marriage). A customer brings a newspaper in and somehow the story of \\"Eddy's murder\\" and Frankie's suicide is already in the paper. Olaf is convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. Eddie is summoned to carry out the execution, and at first sees it as an opportunity to avenge Frankie's death. When the time comes, however, he is unable to go through with it and confesses his identity to the prison staff. He returns to the barber's shop. When Ron comes to work the next morning, he finds Eddie's dangling body and dials 999 (emergency telephone number).

In July 1945 Box bought the screen rights to a story by Monckton Hoffe called Grim Fairy Tale, intending to make it a vehicle for Todd. Box was impressed by the style and themes of psychological cinemas made before the war in French cinema, and wanted to do a British film along these lines.Spicer p 68 It was the first film of a new 14-picture quarter-million pound contract between Todd and J. Arthur Rank (she was to make six films with Box and eight with Rank). Crawford's casting was announced in January 1946. It was known at one stage as Streets Paved with Water. =Shooting= Filming started in March 1946 and went for ten weeks. It was the first notable role of Maxwell Reed who had been in The Company of Youth (he later made The Brothers for Box). Sidney Box's sister Betty worked on the movie. Shooting was difficult with none of the three leads getting along. In April 1946 it was reported that Brock Williams was directing. =Post Production= Box saw a rough cut in July 1946 and was unhappy with the result, particularly Bennett's direction and Todd's performance. Over the next six months, Box reworked the script, particularly the beginning and ending. Alan Osbiston was hired to reshoot scenes and re- edit the movie. In January 1947 Muriel Box was still dissatisfied.Spicer p 70-71 Post production was also difficult because of censor objections. Among the scenes altered were a rape scene, gory details of a fight, and a death cell scene. Due to difficulties with the censors the film was not seen until almost two years after completion, and only after several cuts were made. Another reason given for the delay was that the producers wanted to wait until Todd's first Hollywood movie, The Paradine Case, had been released. Reception The film was moderately successful at the British box office but failed to recoup its relatively high cost. The difficulties with the censor led J. Arthur Rank to refuse to finance a project of Box's, The Killer and the Slain.

Based on a story by Sonya Levien, the film is about a young idealistic missionary who smuggles a group of Chinese war orphans into the United States posing as the wife of a wealthy commodore who went missing after their ship was torpedoed and sunk. After safely sequestering the orphans in the commodore's family mansion, her plans start to unravel when she falls in love with commodore's grandson and the commodore himself turns up alive and well. Originally intended as Durbin's dramatic debut, Universal insisted on adding songs. The original director of the film was Jean Renoir, and though most of his completed footage was retained, final directorial credit was given to Bruce Manning, the film's producer. Frank Skinner and Hans J. Salter were nominated for an Oscar for Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Plot A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a $500 bond ($ today) is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety. Along the way, they encountered a dying Chinese woman, and Ruth agreed to care for her child as well. Moved by her personal story and her beautiful singing voice, Tom is soon smitten with the young woman. After learning that she, as the commodore's \\"widow\\", will inherit his vast shipping fortune, and faced with pressure from the family and press, Ruth gathers the children and attempts to sneak away during the night, but Tom discovers them. Wanting to end the deception, Ruth confesses to Tom that she smuggled the orphans aboard the commodore's ship, believing it was headed to Calcutta. During the voyage, they were discovered by the commodore who promised to help Ruth get the orphans into the United States, even if it meant adopting them. After their ship was torpedoed, Ruth and Timothy put the children into a lifeboat‚Äîlosing only one child, a boy named Pepe‚Äîand were later picked up by another steamship. Angered by the deception, Tom insists that Ruth stay and continue the charade until the publicity about her \\"marriage\\" dies down, after which he will care for the orphans at the mansion once she leaves. In the coming days, as she watches Tom caring for the children, Ruth falls in love with him. When the children's immigration papers finally arrive, Ruth prepares to leave as promised, despite her feelings for Tom and the children. Later at the station, while Ruth waits for her train to Philadelphia, Tom arrives at Timothy's request, unaware that Ruth is preparing to leave. Timothy lies to Tom, telling him that the stranger sitting next to her is her fianc√©‚Äîintending to make Tom jealous and prevent her from leaving. The ploy works, as Tom congratulates the stranger on his upcoming marriage. In the ensuing commotion, Tom escorts Ruth away from the train station and they return to the mansion. Sometime later, at a China relief ball held at the mansion, Ruth sings an aria, Puccini's Vissi d'arte, to the assembled guests while Tom looks on with loving admiration. By now they have expressed their love for each other. Suddenly, the commodore steps forward, having been rescued along with Pepe following the torpedo attack. Knowing what Ruth has done for the children, he plays along with the deception, telling the guests how happy he is that fate spared his \\"dear wife\\". Afterwards the commodore tells Ruth that he'll marry her for real and raise the orphans as his own children, unaware she is in love with Tom. The commodore's plans change when he learns that Ruth and Tom are in love. Addressing the guests, the commodore confesses that he and Ruth were never really married, but that in three days she is going to become Mrs. Holliday‚ÄîMrs. Tom Holliday‚Äîthe wife of his grandson.

He was a Nationalist member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing Eastern Suburbs from 1922 until 1925, and Coogee from 1927 to his death in 1928. Federal Nationalist MP Thomas Ley, an enemy of Goldstein's who was later convicted of murder in England, is often held responsible for his death. Background Goldstein was born in London, to tailor Solomon Goldstein and his wife Hannah, formerly Cohen. Arriving in Australia in 1888, he was educated at Crown Street Public School, before becoming a businessman. He married Olive Hopkins, with whom he had two sons, in 1903. In 1922 he was elected as one of the five members for Eastern Suburbs in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, but he was defeated at the state election three years later. He returned to Parliament as the member for Coogee after the end of proportional representation in 1927. Goldstein was a shareholder in the Prickly Pear Company, which had been organised by former New South Wales Justice Minister and federal MP Thomas Ley. The company's failure had been preceded by Ley selling all of his shares. Goldstein, one of many shareholders who had lost their investments when the company collapsed, began a campaign against Ley, but was subsequently found dead after a fall from the Coogee cliffs. Although it was ruled a case of accidental death, there are grounds for believing that he had been killed at Ley's behest; by this time Ley was already suspected of having done away with his federal predecessor Frederick McDonald (who disappeared in 1926) and with Keith Greedor, a business associate who had drowned in 1928 after having launched an investigation into Ley's business practices. The Goldstein Reserve at Coogee Beach is named after him.

Binns was the son of Alderman Joseph Binns, who later became Lord Mayor of Manchester. He was educated at elementary schools and at Manchester College of Technology, and became a consulting engineer, working for ICI. He was a member of Greenwich Borough Council from 1932 to 1949, and was Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee of the Metropolitan Boroughs from 1945 to 1949. At the 1945 general election he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gillingham in Kent. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Supply, John Wilmot, from 1946 to 1947. He was defeated at the 1950 general election, after catching influenza during the campaign, and was never returned to the House of Commons. Binns was appointed as a Commissioner of the Public Works Loan Board in 1948, a role held until 1972, becoming Deputy Chairman of the board in 1958 and Chairman in 1970. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the New Year Honours 1961. Family Binns married Daisy Graham in 1924, and they had two sons: Graham and Joseph Christopher.

Pierce. History The original location (1109 SW Washington, ), which operated from 1985‚Äì1986, had a changing variety of single coin-operated art installations accessible from the street, as elaborate window displays, and a large uncurated art gallery where any and all could sell their art available for purchase inside. It also had other installations by Pierce besides the coin operated art window installations, such as the artitorium, the hall of art horrors and \\"sex or money\\" (a parody of a catholic confessional booth). Fundraisers were called \\"art parties,\\" with bands and artists and kegs of beer, a precursor to Pierce's cable access show, also called \\"Where's the ART!! (1986-1990), that featured anyone who wanted to be on, in a live unscripted format, with Portland's own \\"Elvis\\" (see below) as sidekick, and Pierce as director producer and talent host impresario, with a generally rebellious crew of fellow artists and sound producers ever at the ready to interfere with Pierce's or the visiting artists' and band members' personal vision, making for a wild romp of weatherscreen inspired cg chaos that was surprisingly often a lot of fun to watch. At the second location (219 SW Ankeny, 1987‚Äì1994, ), the entire store front was again a work of art, and included several custom-built coin-operated automated art exhibits by Pierce that moved and made sounds in response to pressing buttons, featuring weddings, a \\"church experience\\" (hence the popular name 24 Hour Church of Elvis), or a visit to Dr. Justin D. Nikov-Time, the World's Cheapest psychic, for example. It would dispense (or not) various trinkets, pamphlets, fortunes, etc. for prices ranging from 25 cents to a dollar, mostly hand made by Pierce. The machines were run by Commodore 64 computers, and included crude graphics and speech synthesis. These machines were always accessible, hence the first part of the name. Other items by the artist were available inside the store when it was open. Also inside, one would often find the street performer called \\"Elvis\\" who would play a few songs on a cardboard guitar, in his sequined jumpsuit and thick, dark-rimmed glasses. This performer is still a regular fixture at Portland Saturday Market. The third location (720 SW Ankeny, 1994‚Äì2002, ) was devoted primarily towards 1970s popular culture memorabilia. By necessity, Pierce offered a personal tour, from room to room, describing her grand vision for re-establishing some of the exhibits from the original location on Washington St. At the end of the tour, Pierce would try (often desperately) to sell t-shirts. It was on the second floor and lacked any of the coin-operated machines of the older locations, although several cut-out holes in the first floor of the building hinted that they were intended to be installed at this location, but never were. The museum offered legal weddings for $25 and \\"cheap, not legal\\" weddings for $5. The fake weddings could be same sex. Despite the name, the third incarnation of the 24 Hour Church was not open 24 hours, as indicated by a sign on the door which read \\"24 Hour Church of Elvis: Usually open Noon to 5, 8 - 11 a lot. Call (503) 226-3671 for reassurance\\". The fourth location (2008-2013 408 N.W. Couch St. ) (pictured above) was conceived by Pierce to look like an artistic bank machine. She designed it and built it and wired it and programmed it for coin operation completely by herself. Unfortunately, by that time, newer programming possibilities like wifi interference had surpassed her minimal knowledge of electronics and it was next to impossible after a while to keep even simple momentary contact pushbuttons working. The environment seemed inhospitable (see comments on talk page and read the references carefully below), possibly due to (1) religious intolerance; (2) residual disdain by old school members of Portland's art community for Pierce's democratic insistence on access for all; (3) that old timey sexist misinterpretation often caused by those who first present themselves to the public with a youthful impression as a dilletante more prone to wearing heels than flats; or (4) all of the above. The storefront closed and was dismantled in March 2013 due to lack of funds for rent. Further reading * Palahniuk, Chuck (2003) \\"Fugitives and Refugees: A Walk in Portland, Oregon\\".

History Church after the 1918 San Ferm√≠n earthquake The first Church at the current site was made of wood and was built in 1763, only three years after the founding of the city. The land was donated by Don Juan de Aponte and Don Juan de Silva; deed dated 1760 in San Germ√°n. The plot was consecrated on August 21, 1760, and the first masonry building erected in 1780. The first Church in masonry presented a more classical line than the present architectural one. At the top of its frontispiece stood a great strait-flat pediment, mounted on six semi-pilastras and a narrow and long frieze. The Temple had two octagonal towers. Its architect was Vicente Piera and the approved drawings date back to 1833. On August 29, 1825 Do√±a Ama Mariana Bracetti Cuebas was baptized at the church and on April 12, 1839, Don Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos was also baptized there. In 1854, a lightning-bolt struck and tore down a wedge-shaped corner of one of its right towers. The damaged tower was later rebuilt. Then in 1870, a full restoration of the building was performed. On November 10, 1900, Jose de Diego held his wedding ceremony at the church. The San Ferm√≠n earthquake on October 11, 1918, destroyed one of its towers and seriously affected the other, leaving what was left of the towers decimated. The remnant of the towers were demolished using dynamite. It was later resolved to build a second church; architect Don Lu√≠s Perocier was asked to create the plans; these were not fully accepted (1920). The church that was built departs only in its details and elements of the first plans of Mr Perocier, nevertheless they retained similar aesthetics. The previous plans, contained three doors with pointed arches and a fourth Gothic arch on the portico. The reconstruction was due to architect Don Lu√≠s f. Nieva and were started in 1922. Pope Paul VI authorized the founding of the Diocese of Mayag√ºez on April 1, 1976, which led to the re-dedication of the church as a cathedral soon after. A few years later, the first bishop of the city, Mons. Ulises Casiano Vargas (who assumed the bishop's office on April 30, 1976), led the drive for the cathedral's remodeling following Perocier's original plan, including its two towers. The architect for the remodeling was Carlos Juan Ralat. The remodeling had a cost of $3,5 million and took approximately two years to complete. It was originally planned to take one year; yet, the construction was delayed after changes in the plans because of the existing deteriorated condition of the roof. The remodeling was also delayed after crypts were discovered. Among the remains discovered in the crypts were those of some of the founders of Mayag√ºez; Don Faustino Mart√≠nez y Don Lorenzo Mart√≠nez Matos. The remodeled cathedral was reopened on January 1, 2004 and counted with the participation of representatives of the Vatican. Waters of liberty Cathedral as seen in 2005 after renovations In the 19th century Segundo Ruiz Belvis and Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances, both members of \\"The Secret Abolitionist Society\\" founded by Betances, baptized and emancipated thousands of black slave children in the church. The event, which was known as \\"aguas de libertad\\" (waters of liberty), was carried out at the Cathedrals baptismal font. The two men would buy slave children and who were then redeemed and emancipated the moment of receiving this sacrament. Since buying the freedom of slave children cost 50 pesos if the child had been baptized, and 25 pesos if the child had not, Betances, Basora, Segundo Ruiz Belvis and other members of the society waited next to the baptismal font on Sundays, expecting a master to take a slave family to baptize their child. Before the child was baptized, Betances or his partners gave money to the parents, which they in turn used to buy the child's freedom from his master. The child, once freed, was baptized minutes after. This action was later described as having the child receive the \\"aguas de libertad\\" (waters of liberty).Ojeda Reyes, F√©lix, El Desterrado de Par√≠s, p. 49. The author quotes Salvador Brau on the matter. The baptismal font where these baptisms were performed still exists, and is owned by a local family of merchants, the Del Moral family, who keep it at their Mayag√ºez house.

One of the founders of Kommune 1, Teufel cultivated a theatrical, humorous public image‚Äîencapsulated in his idea of the \\"Spa√üguerilla\\" (\\"fun guerrilla\\").Grimes, William. \\"Fritz Teufel, a German Protester in the ‚Äô60s, Dies at 67\\", The New York Times, August 7, 2010. Accessed August 8, 2010. In the 1970s he rejected this image and became involved with the violent Movement 2 June. He was jailed several times in the 1960s and 1970s. Teufel was born on 17 June 1943, in Ingelheim and was raised in Ludwigsburg. He attended the Free University of Berlin, studying German literature and theater, which also allowed him to avoid conscription. In January 1967 Teufel, together with Dieter Kunzelmann and other radicals, founded Kommune 1 in West Berlin on Stuttgarter Platz, the nation's first politically motivated commune. Teufel was one of the instigators of what became known as the \\"Pudding Assassination\\", in which protesters planned to throw plastic bags filled with flour, pudding and yogurt at Vice President of the United States Hubert H. Humphrey, during an April 1967 state visit. 11 participants in the \\"plot\\" were arrested, but were quickly released, and Teufel was on his way to becoming a celebrity. Following a demonstration on 2 June 1967 against the Shah of Iran that resulted in the death of protester Benno Ohnesorg, Teufel was arrested and charged with serious breach of peace. It was not until December that he was released, after he and many students with him had begun a hunger strike. His sympathizers held demonstrations, chanting \\"Freedom for Fritz Teufel\\" and \\"Drive the devil out of Moabit!\\" (Teufel was held in Moabit prison and the word \\"teufel\\" is German for \\"devil\\"). Teufel was eventually acquitted of the charges, but spent six months in custody before his release. Like Kunzelmann and other German leftists, Teufel drifted toward the embrace of armed struggle at the end of the 1960s; in 1970 he told a journalist that \\"the clown Teufel is dead.\\" After being tossed out of Kommune 1, Teufel moved to Munich, where he lived in a commune with future Red Army Faction member Irmgard M√∂ller. Teufel founded the Tupamaros Munich militant group and later became involved with the Movement 2 June. Teufel was arrested in the early 1970s for his involvement in the firebombing of a Munich courthouse, for which he was convicted and sentenced to two years in jail. In 1975 he was arrested and accused of taking part in the Movement 2 June's kidnapping of Peter Lorenz, a politician from the Christian Democratic Union. Teufel was imprisoned for five years before presenting an airtight alibi at his trial, proving that he had been working under an assumed name at a factory in Essen on the date in question. He would later say that he had remained silent until then to expose flaws in the German justice system.Staff. \\"Fritz Teufel, The Daily Telegraph, August 5, 2010. Accessed August 8, 2010. He was convicted of lesser crimes, including firearm possession and robbery, and sentenced to time served. By the time of his release from prison Teufel had broken with the radical left. He briefly lived in London but in the late 1980s moved back to Berlin, where he contributed articles to Die Tageszeitung and worked as a bicycle courier. He was willing to grant interviews with reporters only under the condition that they agreed to play an hour of table tennis before he would be willing to answer any questions. Teufel suffered from Parkinson's disease and died on July 6, 2010, at the age of 67. He was survived by his partner, Helene Lollo.

Founded in King County in 1850, outside the independent city of Brooklyn, it became a Jewish burial ground as early as 1857, at first serving primarily German Jewish immigrants. Brooklyn cemeteries were authorized under the Rural Cemetery Act of 1847, which allowed for the construction of commercial cemeteries outside what were then city limits. This part of Kings County was not yet incorporated into the City of Brooklyn, and the legislation resulted in the development of several large parcels of farmland as cemeteries.\\"Scarce Brooklyn Cemeteries\\", The Brooklyn Ink, 28 March 2011 Later in the 19th and early 20th centuries most Jewish immigrants came from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Cemetery configuration Washington Cemetery is made up of five \\"gated cemeteries,\\" separated by several local Brooklyn streets. The cemetery office building is located on the grounds of Cemetery #1, which was the original cemetery. It is served by the Bay Parkway station of the F train of the New York City Subway. The founder of Washington Cemetery, James Arlington Bennet, is buried there, as are his wife and son. Bennet was born in New York, and was proprietor and principal of the Arlington House, an educational institution on Long Island. He usually is remembered as Joseph Smith's first choice as Vice-Presidential running mate in the United States presidential election of 1844, before Smith was assassinated. His surname is misspelled on his headstone, which reads, \\"Author of Bennett's Book Keeping & Other Works. Founder of Washington Cemetery.\\" =Cemetery #1= Cemetery #1 is shaped like a pentagon, and bordered on three of its sides by major Brooklyn streets: Ocean Parkway, Bay Parkway, and McDonald Avenue. The main entrance and cemetery office building are on Bay Parkway just off McDonald Avenue. The interior of Cemetery #1 is crisscrossed by paths called Rose, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Aster, Lotus, and Evergreen avenues. It has numerical posts from number one to number one hundred and forty-nine \\"A\\" (1‚Äì149A), sections marked \\"ranges\\". It has \\"burial society\\" sections established by early immigrant groups of landsmannschaft or synagogue congregations. Burials are still being conducted here. This section houses the majority of the mausoleums and larger monuments. In December 2010, this section sustained the majority of some 200 overturned and broken headstones damaged by vandals at the cemetery. Although there are concrete walkways through the area, grave markers are very closely positioned in some areas, and visitors sometimes have to walk on grass. =Cemetery #2= Cemetery #2 is located across from Cemetery #1 and the office building. It is triangular, bounded on two of its sides by major thoroughfares: McDonald Avenue on the northeast and Bay Parkway on the northwest; it has four entrances and exits. Cemetery posts are numbered 150 to 237. It is crisscrossed by paths, and houses burial or congregational society sections. Its named paths are Cedar, Maple, and Cypress avenues. =Cemetery #3= Cemetery #3 is located across Bay Parkway directly across from Cemetery #2.

Carimi had 49 starts at left tackle in his four-year Wisconsin Badgers college career, which culminated at the 2011 Rose Bowl. He was awarded the 2010 Outland Trophy, as the nation's top collegiate interior lineman. He was also a unanimous All-American, and the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year. Carimi was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the first round, 29th overall pick, of the 2011 NFL Draft. He began the 2011 season as the Bears' starting right tackle. Carimi was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on June 9, 2013, for the Buccaneers' 2014 6th round pick. He signed with the Atlanta Falcons in 2014, and played in all 16 games for them that season, making 7 starts. Early years Carimi was born in Lake Forest, Illinois. He attended Monona Grove High School in Monona, Wisconsin. He started there as a , freshman. He grew into his body, worked on his flexibility, and developed his athleticism by becoming a karate black belt. He credits his karate training with laying a foundation for his later discipline, improving his flexibility, and helping him develop the hand coordination and hand placement he uses as a football player. He was on the high school's track team. Seeded 15th in the state in discus as a senior, he placed 5th in the 2006 Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association track and field Division 1 discus championships, at . He earned four letters in track, and was team captain in his senior year. Carimi also played football for the high school's Silver Eagles. Playing both offensive and defensive tackle, he lettered for four years. In 2005, the Silver Eagles ran behind him 70% of the time when he was at offensive tackle, while as a defensive end he had five quarterback sacks. He was voted a football Parade All-American and PrepStar All-American as a senior, while he captained the team.\\"Carimi has One-Track Mind; Offensive Tackle Hopes to Start\\", Jeff Potrykus, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, August 15, 2007 He was also the Capital Times and Wisconsin State Journal Player of the Year, first-team all-state in 2005, a first-team selection by the Associated Press and the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association (as a two-way player), and was twice first-team all-conference. Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Carimi was rated the No. 3 football player in Wisconsin and the No. 30 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2006. His coach Mike Stassi predicted: \\"He's going to be the new wave of offensive linemen, that can run and move. And this guy's got it all.\\" College career Carimi elected to attend his hometown University of Wisconsin-Madison. He chose it because of its academic and football reputations, a scholarship that he was offered, and its proximity to his home. He majored in civil engineering, and played football for the Wisconsin Badgers football team. He had played right tackle and defensive end in high school. But in his first year in 2006, during which time he was redshirted, he began practicing at left tackle, because it was the next open spot. He was described that season as running very well, and having tenacity, athletic ability, and impressive lateral movement while pass- blocking. Carimi started all 13 games as a freshman at left tackle for the Badgers in 2007, replacing All-American Joe Thomas, who was drafted by the Cleveland Browns at No. 3 in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft.\\"Attitude Pays Off in a Big Way; Bielema Names Freshman Carimi as his Starting Left Tackle\\", Jeff Potrykus, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, August 21, 2007, Retrieved February 11, 2011 He was a second-team Freshman All-American selection by Rivals.com and The Sporting News, and a first-team Freshman All-Big-Ten selection by The Sporting News, as well as an Academic All-Big-Ten. Carimi in 2009 As a sophomore in 2008, he started all 10 games he played in. That year, he was second-team Pre-season All-Big Ten by Lindy's and Athlon Sports, honorable mention Sophomore All-American by College Football News, and Academic All-Big Ten. As a junior in 2009, he started all 13 games. He was a first-team Mid-season All-Big Ten selection by Phil Steele, a first-team All- Big Ten selection by media, a fourth-team All-American by Phil Steele, and Academic All-Big Ten. Commenting in Sports Illustrated in October 2009, Tony Pauline wrote: \\"Carimi is the next great offensive lineman to come from the Badger program. He's a terrific pass-protecting left tackle, with the size necessary to grow into a dominant run blocker.\\" During his senior year in 2010, when he was co-Captain of the Big Ten champion Badgers, Phil Steele made him a mid-season first-team All-American selection. He contributed to an offense that was ranked 5th in the nation in scoring (at 41.5 ppg), and 12th in rushing (at 245.7 yards per game). As a senior, Carimi won the 2010 Outland Trophy, awarded to the nation's top collegiate interior lineman. He was the second Outland Trophy winner in school history, joining Joe Thomas, and the 14th Big Ten awardee. Seven of the prior ten Outland Trophy winners were top-10 NFL draft picks. He also was named the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American, having received first-team honors from the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, Sporting News, and Walter Camp Football Foundation.2011 NCAA Football Records Book, Award Winners, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 12 (2011). Retrieved June 30, 2012. In addition, he was a consensus first-team All-Big Ten selection, and Academic All-Big Ten, and won the Wayne Souza Coaches Appreciation Award (Offense). He helped Wisconsin to an 11‚Äì2 record for the season, and a Rose Bowl appearance. At the start of his senior year he had been named a pre-season first-team All-American by Lindy's and Consensus Draft Services, a first-team All-American and All-Big Ten by Athlon Sports, second-team All-American and first-team All-Big Ten by Phil Steele, second- team All-American by The Kickoff, first-team All-Big Ten by Blue Ribbon, and named to the Rotary Lombardi Award Watch List. He was named a mid-season first-team All-American and first-team mid-season All-Big Ten by Phil Steele, and second-team All-American by Sports Illustrated. In March 2011, the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame awarded him the Marty Glickman Award, as the male Jewish Athlete of the Year. In college, he started 49 of a possible 52 games, all at left tackle. In an April 2011 interview, he indicated that he had still never been to a professional football game in his life. Professional career =2011 NFL Draft= Carimi was drafted in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, with the 29th pick on April 28, 2011. The Bears had actually sought to \\"trade up\\", and pick Carimi even earlier in the draft. They tried to make a trade with the Baltimore Ravens, to use Baltimore's earlier slot to select Carimi at No. 26, but the trade fell through at the last moment due to a miscommunication. In the year prior to drafting Carimi, the Bears had allowed a league-high 56 sacks, and ranked 22nd in running the ball. Bears Head Coach Lovie Smith said Carimi would come in as a left tackle. General manager Jerry Angelo said he is versatile enough to play both left and right tackle, while Smith said the Bears would keep all options open, including potentially that of guard. He was nicknamed \\"The Bear Jew\\" after the Bears drafted him, a reference to a character in the movie Inglourious Basterds, by Chicago radio personality Dan Bernstein, of 670 \\"The Score.\\" Carimi tweeted that he was considering adopting the nickname. At the January 2011 Senior Bowl weigh-in, Carimi was the second-tallest player at 6 feet 7‚Öõ inches (2.01 m), had the second-longest arms (35¬º inches), and had the second-longest wingspan (83¬º inches; second to Mississippi State's Derek Sherrod).\\"Senior Bowl Weigh-In Results\\" , Wes Bunting, National Football Post, January 24, 2011, Retrieved February 11, 2011 His hand size was 10‚Öú inches, and he weighed in at 315 pounds, 10 pounds lighter than his playing weight in college. ESPN analysts rated him the third-best player at the Senior Bowl. NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock observed that Carimi is \\"a little bit like a Jon Runyan. He's kind of got a little nasty to him.\\" Mayock also described him as \\"a thug, which I mean in a positive sense\\", and commented on his ability as a run blocker. He added: \\"I think he‚Äôs the kind of guy ... you try ... at left tackle, and if he can‚Äôt handle the speed out there, you‚Äôve got an All-Pro right tackle.\\" Matt Bowen of the National Football Post said that Carimi was his favorite prospect in the draft, and was one of the five players who most impressed him at Senior Bowl activities. Bowen thought his pass protection was at NFL standards, noting that he had \\"good enough feet to get back and attack speed off of the edge because of his reach. There is no doubt Carimi can win up front in the run game,\\" while adding that he \\"is the type of player you want in the locker room.\\" Wes Bunting of the National Football Post said: > he understands angles, and he's a real velcro player. I mean, once he gets > those big paws on you and he has these long arms, it's really tough to > disengage from... No one gets after the run game as well as Carimi. Neil Hayes of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"Many consider Carimi to be the best offensive-tackle prospect in the class ... Carimi played well against top competition and his feet are quick enough to play left tackle.\\" CBS Sports lauded \\"his prototypical size\\" and \\"excellent athleticism\\". As to his pass blocking, it noted that he has \\"the elite agility and nimble feet to protect the quarterback's blindside. Very difficult to turn the corner against because of his lateral movement and solid footwork. Also protects the inside lane well. Delivers a strong hand punch capable of knocking back an opponent .... Uses his length to block his man with one hand and knock an edge blitzer off his path with the other.\\" With regard to his run blocking, it said he is \\"known as an athletic pass protector, but is a strong blocker\\". While he exclusively played left tackle in college, he was projected by some as a left tackle and by others as a right tackle. At the February 2011 NFL combine pre- draft workouts, he completed 29 repetitions on the 225-pound bench press, a \\"solid number\\", according to Sports Illustrateds Tony Pauline. He also ran the 40-yard dash in under 5.2, which was faster than expected and considered very good. Pauline reported that \\"his footwork was smooth in pass protection, and he looked strong in run blocking drills.\\" At the March Wisconsin Pro Day workout, Bucky Brooks of NFL.com reported that Carimi: > showed good footwork and lateral quickness in drills, and his body control > is surprising given his frame. Although he might experience some problems > against speed rushers, teams will certainly start him out as a left tackle > and move him to the right if he falters. Asked what his agent had advised him, relative to a possible NFL lockout, Carimi answered: \\"Don't spend money.\\" =Chicago Bears (2011‚Äì13)= On July 29, 2011, the Bears signed Carimi to a $7.056 million four-year contract. He began his rookie 2011 season as the Bears' starting right tackle. In Week 2 against the New Orleans Saints, Carimi suffered a season-ending injury to his right knee, that included the dislocation of his kneecap and which required multiple surgeries, including one in December to repair connective tissue around his patella and medial collateral ligament. He played two games for the season, starting both of them at right tackle. In 2012, controversy ensued when the Saints were found working with a bounty program, which led to questions over whether Carimi was among the players targeted. In 2012‚Äì13, Carimi played in 16 games, starting 14 of them (11 at right tackle, and 3 at right guard). After 11 starts at right tackle Carimi was moved from right tackle, where he was replaced by Jonathan Scott, to guard, though he came back to start the last game of the season at right tackle. Due to injuries to Lance Louis and Chris Spencer in Week 12 against the Minnesota Vikings, Carimi played at guard for the first time in his career. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2013)= On June 9, 2013, Carimi was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a 2014 sixth-round selection. The Bucs offensive line coach Bob Bostad coached Carimi at Wisconsin. Carimi was expected to compete with Demar Dotson for the starting right tackle position on Tampa Bay. He started the first two games of the season at left guard. Carimi had two years left on his contract, and was scheduled to earn a guaranteed base salary of $1,016,000 in 2013. On February 10, 2014, the Buccaneers cut Carimi. His release came after a few weeks of his former Bears head coach, Lovie Smith, being hired as the Buccaneer's new year coach. =Atlanta Falcons (2014)= On February 17, 2014, Carimi signed with the Atlanta Falcons for one year. Their offensive line coach was Mike Tice, who Carimi had worked with when he played for the Bears. During the season, Carimi played in all 16 games, making 7 starts. He played left and right tackle, right guard, and tight end, playing 597 snaps (215 as a run-blocker; 382 as a pass-blocker). Personal life Carimi, born in Lake Forest, Illinois, is the son of Sanford Carimi, a physician in the Janesville, Wisconsin area, and Alayne Gardner-Carimi, a businesswoman. He weighed 24 pounds by the time he was four months old. He grew up on the Northeast Side of Madison, and then in the nearby town of Cottage Grove when he was a freshman in high school. His sister Hannah, who is two years older than he is, was a kick fighter when she was younger and later rowed for the University of Wisconsin, on its women's openweight crew team.\\"Returning Varsity Openweights\\" , Wisconsin Women's Rowing; 2008‚Äì09 The two of them lived together in college, along with one of his football team teammates. Carimi's Italian surname comes from his paternal step-grandfather. His parents are Jewish. His mother, originally Catholic, converted to Judaism, and has had an active role in the religious education of her children. Carimi is a practicing Jew and very committed to his religion, and found time as a youth to both go to his football practices and to attend Madison's Temple Beth-El, a Reform synagogue. By the time of his Bar Mitzvah, he was already so tall that while blessing him, and even with Carimi bending down, the synagogue's education director had to put his hands on Carimi's shoulders rather than atop his head. For his Bar Mitzvah project, he helped build a house for Habitat for Humanity while he was in seventh grade. Carimi continued his Jewish studies after his Bar Mitzvah. In his first year of college in 2007, when Yom Kippur (the holiest day of the year in Judaism; a fast day that is the \\"Day of Atonement\\") fell on a Saturday, he fasted until an hour before the Big Ten Conference opener against Iowa started that night. Carimi said, \\"Religion is a part of me, and I don't want to just say I'm Jewish. I actually do make sacrifices that I know are hard choices.\\" At the 2011 NFL combine, when asked whether he would play on Yom Kippur in the NFL, he responded: \\"I already looked out over the next 15 years, and Yom Kippur doesn't fall on a Sunday.\\" As a college player he took the nickname \\"The Jewish Hammer\\" or \\"The Hammer\\". He explains that as The Hebrew Hammer was taken \\"they had to come up with something else\\", and that the \\"hammer\\" aspect refers to his penchant for throwing opposing players down on the field. A more recent nickname, following his being picked by the Chicago Bears, is \\"The Bear Jew\\", a reference to a character in the 2009 film Inglourious Basterds. One of his favorite Jewish football players was a former Badger, Matt Bernstein, and he looks to 49ers former offensive linesman Harris Barton as a role model. His uncle suffered from leukemia as a child, underwent chemotherapy while he was in second grade, and lost his hair in the process. At nine years old, he died. He was mentioned often in family discussions. Carimi thought he would do something \\"that wouldn't take a lot of my time but would help other people.\\" He grew his hair out for 20 months, until it was long enough in 2010 to donate to Locks of Love‚Äîa charity that makes wigs out of donated hair to help poor children suffering from illnesses that cause long-term hair loss. Carimi is married to former UW-Milwaukee basketball player/model Danielle Jorgenson. The couple have two children: a son and a daughter.

His playing career as a catcher spanned ten seasons, including four in Major League Baseball. Over his major league career, he played with the St. Louis Browns (1925‚Äì27) and the Cincinnati Reds (1929). Dixon was known as a light-hitting, defensive specialist. Professional career =Early career= Born in Chicago, Dixon began his professional baseball career in at the age of 25 with the Moline Plowboys of the Three-I League. His strong throwing arm attracted the attention of Jack Hendricks, then the manager of the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. Dixon spent three seasons with Indianapolis, but saw little playing time, so at the end of the season, he asked for the club to release him. All the teams in the league passed on making an offer for his services except for the St. Paul Saints. Given a chance to play every day with the Saints in , Dixon posted a .272 batting average with 10 home runs in 149 games. His solid defensive abilities as a catcher helped the Saints win the 1924 American Association pennant. =St. Louis Browns= Dixon's performance earned him a promotion to the major leagues when on January 4, 1925, the Saints traded him to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for Norm McMillan, Pat Collins, Ray Kolp and US$35,000 ($ in today's standards). Browns manager, George Sisler said that he would be the team's starting catcher. Dixon did not sign a contract with the Browns before spring training and as a consequence, news reports dubbed him a \\"holdout\\". On March 13, it was announced that he had \\"wired for transportation\\", meaning that he was reporting to spring training with the Browns. Dixon made his major league debut on April 14, 1925 at the age of 30. In his first season in the majors, Dixon batted .224 with 27 runs, 46 hits, 11 doubles, one triple, one home run and 19 RBIs in 76 games while sharing catching duties with Pinky Hargrave. During 1926 spring training, The Evening Independent noted that Dixon was regarded as \\"one of the smartest receivers in the American League\\". He was also cited along with future Hall of Fame member, Mickey Cochrane, as one of the best young catchers in major league baseball. In February 1926, the Browns acquired veteran catcher Wally Schang who would take over as their starting catcher, while Dixon took a role as a backup catcher. He spent his last season with the Browns in 1927, once again backing up Schang. On the season, Dixon batted .194 with six runs, 20 hits, three doubles, one triple and 12 RBIs in 36 games. =Later career= Leo Dixon pictured working at his father's hardware store. The Browns traded Dixon to the Double-A Baltimore Orioles in . With the Orioles, he hit for a .268 average with 79 hits, 12 doubles, three triples and three home runs in 102 games. Dixon was then selected by the Cincinnati Reds from the Orioles in the 1928 Rule 5 draft. He was reunited with his former manager, Jack Hendricks, who was then the manager for the Reds. On March 25, 1929, Hendricks announced that he intended to keep Dixon on the 25-man roster going into the season. He served as the third-string catcher behind Johnny Gooch and Clyde Sukeforth during the season. Dixon only managed a .167 batting average with five hits, two doubles and two runs batted in. He played in his final major league game on August 17, 1929. The Reds released Dixon to the Double-A Columbus Senators in . With the Senators that season, Dixon batted .251 with 73 hits, 11 doubles and four triples in 100 games. In , Dixon attended spring training with the St. Louis Cardinals, but did not make the final roster. At the age of 37, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in May 1932, however, he did not make an appearance with the team. Career statistics In a four- year major league career, Dixon played in 159 games, accumulating 88 hits in 427 at bats for a .206 career batting average, along with 1 home run, 41 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .291. He had a career fielding percentage of .971. Dixon's strong throwing arm was made evident in , when he led American League catchers with a baserunners caught stealing percentage of 51.4%. Over his minor league career, Dixon batted .245 with 427 hits, 72 doubles, 21 triples and 14 home runs in 572 games. Dixon played as a catcher in all of his 157 career major league games. Because of Dixon's low batting average, which hovered just over .200, his name (along with Jim Mason's) was proposed for inclusion in a new term for poor hitting called the \\"Mason-Dixon Line\\" (.204), which is closer to .200 than the Mendoza Line (.215). Later life Dixon worked as a clerk in his father's hardware store during the off- season. He died on April 11, at the age of 89 in Chicago, Illinois. Dixon was buried at Holy Sepulchre Catholic Cemetery in Worth, Illinois.

The remaining ranch structures are located on the west bank of the Donner und Blitzen River in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The ranch was built by Peter French, a well known 19th-century cattle baron. The P Ranch became headquarters for the French-Glenn Livestock Company, which eventually covered over . After French was murdered in 1897, the French-Glenn Livestock Company slowly sold off the P Ranch property. In 1935, the United States Government purchased the remaining P Ranch property to add to an adjacent wildlife refuge. The Civilian Conservation Corps demolished most of the original ranch buildings in the 1930s, and a fire destroyed the main ranch house in 1947. The few remaining P Ranch structures are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Early history  Around 9,800 years ago, the Harney Basin was covered by a single great lake covering . The birds, animals, and plants found in the wetland around the lake provided abundant food for early inhabitants. About 3,500 years ago, small villages began to develop around the lakes and along the banks of the river. Beginning about 1,400 years ago, extended droughts began to shrink the lake and surrounding wetlands.\\"The Prehistory of the Malheur Marshes\\", Malheur National Wildlife refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Princeton, Oregon, 10 November 2008. While there are no records of the earliest people to inhabit the Harney Basin, Native Americans used the wetland areas around Malheur Lake, Harney Lake, and Donner und Blitzen River for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers. By the time Europeans began to explore the area in the early nineteenth century, the Northern Paiute people were well established in the Harney Basin including the area that became the P Ranch. Hudson's Bay Company fur trappers were the first Europeans to visit the Harney Basin. Peter Skene Ogden passed along the north shore of Malheur Lake in 1826. Other fur trapping expeditions followed in the 1830s. Several military expeditions passed through the area in the late 1850s. Major Enoch Steen was the first non-native to explore the Donner und Blitzen River area in 1860. Steens Mountain, that dominates southern Harney County, was named in his honor. In the 1860s, the United States Army established a number of military outposts in the Harney Basin.\\"A Little Bit of Malheur History\\", Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Princeton, Oregon, 10 November 2008.  Peter French  Peter French established the P Ranch Peter French was born in Missouri in 1849. As a boy, he immigrated to California with his family. Then as a young man, French went to work for Doctor Hugh J. Glenn, who owned large tracts of land in the Sacramento Valley. In 1872, Glenn decided to expand his operation into Oregon. To lead the venture, Glenn picked 23-year- old Peter French. French was sent north with six vaqueros and 1,200 head of cattle.Pinyard, David and Donald Peting, \\"Preservation of the Pete French Round Barn\\" , CRM Cultural Resources Management (Vol. 18, No. 5), National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 1995, pp. 30-32.\\"Peter French\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 2002.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

When he arrived in the Blitzen Valley, French ran into a prospector named Porter, who had not found much gold and was eager to move on. French bought Porter's small heard of cattle along with his \\"P\\" brand and rights to the west slope of Steens Mountain where Porter had prospected. French settled along the Donner und Blitzen River. Over the next few years, French drained and fenced thousands of acres of wetlands along the river. That land became the P Ranch, which was named for the \\"P\\" brand acquired from Porter. By the 1870s, the P Ranch was earning a good income for Glenn. Cattle were raised in the lush P Ranch pastures along the river. In the fall, French drove his cattle to the railhead at Winnemucca, Nevada.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"P Ranch\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 735. In 1883, French married Glenn's daughter Ella. Glenn was murdered three weeks later by a former employee. French continued to manage the Oregon operation for the Glenn family, selling more cattle to help pay the family's debts. In 1894, Glenn's heirs decided to incorporate the French-Glenn partnership into the French-Glenn Livestock Company, making French the company president. From his base at the P Ranch, French expanded the company's holdings until the ranch extended from the foothills of Steens Mountain along both sides of the Donner und Blitzen River to Malheur Lake, including the entire south shore of the lake. It also covered all of neighboring Happy and Diamond valleys plus a large part of the Catlow Valley to the south.Engeman, Richard H., The Oregon Companion: An Historical Gazetteer of the Useful, the Curious, and the Arcane, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon, 2009, p. 147.

French's Round Barn was used to train horses.French was not popular with new homesteaders in the area because he owned or controlled most of the water in the southern Harney Basin. His fences also made it difficult for some homesteaders to get to and from their property. On 26 December 1897, French was shot dead by a settler who had been unsuccessful in getting a road easement across French's property. F.C. Lusk, who was the secretary of the French-Glenn Livestock Company prior to French's death, became executor of French's estate and took over as manager of the P Ranch and the company's other properties. To pay off company debts, Lusk gradually sold off ranch assets. In 1906, the P Ranch and the neighboring Diamond Ranch were sold to Henry L. Corbett and his partners his brother Elliott R. Corbett and C.E.S. Wood.C.E.S.Wood would paint there with his friend the American Impresionist Childe Hassam. The Corbett brothers also had Hassam paint oils of the P Ranch for them that hung in their Dunthorpe, Portland, Oregon homes. Henry L. Corbett's was of the Ranch house (burned down in a fire in 1947) and Elliott R. Corbett's was the exact reverse, of the view away from the ranch house. Hassam panted the two opposite views from about the same spot. Elliott Corbett paid Hassam $200 plus room and board for his and remembers Hassam painting it shirtless in the heat swatting the mosquitos that landed on him while continuing his painting. (Elliott R. Corbett Archives, Runton Old Hall, East Runton, UK). In 1916, Louis F. Swift, owner of the Swift Meat Packing Company, joined the P Ranch partnership and the business became the Eastern Oregon Live Stock Company. In the 1920s, the part of the French- Glenn property known as the Barton Lake Ranch was bought by John Jenkins. This property includes the well-known Pete French Round Barn. In 1935, a large part of the P Ranch was incorporated into the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.  Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  The Malheur Migratory Bird Refuge was created in 1908. Over the years, the refuge grew to encompass around Malheur Lake. In 1935, the United States Government purchased of P Ranch property from the Eastern Oregon Live Stock Company for $675,000, adding the land to the refuge. The refuge was later renamed the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. During the 1930s, the refuge hosted three Civilian Conservation Corps camps. One was located at the Sod-House Ranch south of Malheur Lake. A second camp was located at Buena Vista Station and the third was located north of Frenchglen in the P Ranch area. Civilian Conservation Corps crews built a number of stone buildings to house the refuge headquarters at the Sod-House site. In addition, they constructed several refuge buildings at Buena Vista, four lookout towers, the main refuge patrol road, four concrete dams, numerous canals and bridges, and hundreds of miles of fence. The Civilian Conservation Corps also demolished most of the original ranch structures before the camps were closed in 1942. After the Civilian Conservation Corps left, the remaining ranch buildings, including Peter French's main house at the P Ranch, continued to be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to support refuge operations. Unfortunately, a fire destroyed the main ranch house in 1947 (story and photos), leaving only the foundation and a stone chimney that had been attached to the west end of the house.Oster, Clarence A., \\"The P Ranch House Fire An Eyewitness Account\\", Oregon Historical Quarterly (Vol. 106, No. 2), Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, Summer 2005, pp. 284-293. Because it played an important role in the development of the cattle industry in the western United States, the P Ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 29 January 1979. The historic district covers along both sides of the Donner und Blitzen River. Today, the Long Barn is the only historic building left at the site.\\"P Ranch\\", Oregon Historic Site Database, State Historic Preservation Office, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 19 June 2009\\"P Ranch Historical District\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 29 January 1979.  Structures  At its peak, the P Ranch complex included at least twenty-one buildings. Today, only one building and two other historic structures remain at the P Ranch site. In addition to the Long Barn, there is a beef wheel and some original stock fences. The Long Barn was built in the 1880s. It is long and wide. It is a post and beam structure. There are 56 heavy log posts in two rows that support the roof, which is high at its peak. The exterior of the barn is finished with pine and aspen lumber. The roof is covered with pine shingles. The original foundation sills were replaced by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939. The interior of the barn is a single large room. It has a wide center isle running between the two rows of support posts. Hay is still stored in the center isle; often stack to the crest of the roof. Along both side of the barn are feed racks and animal stalls. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service stabilized and restored the Long Barn in 2008. Today, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service uses the Long Barn to bed down horses and store hay. The ranch property also has an original beef wheel, used to hoist slaughtered cattle off the ground to cool. It was built in the 1880s, when Peter French employed a hundred or more ranch hands. To feed all its dependents, the ranch needed to slaughter two cattle per week so the beef wheel was an important piece of structural equipment. The wheel is quite large since it had to lift beef carcasses high enough off the ground that the meat was safe from dogs and coyotes. The wheel is a square pine frame mounted on two large juniper posts.

These fences are made of juniper slabs which are buried in trenches. The fence cross-pieces were originally bound to the slabs with rawhide. There are also several original willow corrals that still exist. These were made by weaving willow shoots between upright juniper posts.Jackman, E.

Critics of the group, including the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Center for American Progress, describe it as a hate group. It has been called the U.S.'s largest anti-Muslim organization. Activities and views The group's founder and central figure is the Lebanese-born conservative activist Brigitte Gabriel. Guy Rodgers, a Republican consultant who was National Field Director for the Christian Coalition of America in the 1990s, is executive director. The group was established in 2007, and grew out of the American Congress for Truth, which Gabriel established in 2002 to promote her beliefs, books, and public appearance. The American Congress for Truth was later renamed Act! for America Education and \\"continues to operate as a separate non-profit tax-exempt organization.\\" = Anti-Muslim activities = Political scientist Nadia Marzouki identified ACT! for America as part of an \\"echo chamber of Islamophobic misinformation\\". The group has been described as anti-Muslim by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting, Buzzfeed News and the Independent, and a hate group by the Center for American Progress and the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Anti-Defamation League states that the \\"ACT stokes irrational fear of Muslims\\" through spreading misinformation and that it \\"propagates the hateful conspiracy theory\\" that there is a Muslim plot to impose Islamic law in the U.S. The Huffington Post, linking to a report by the Center for American Progress, described ACT! for America as \\"a central player in the movement to generate fears about Islamic Sharia law.\\" The report describes the organization as a \\"single-minded Islamophobia [group]\\". Ryan Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized the group as having \\"eagerly tapped into a groundswell of anti-Muslim rage and done what it could to fan the flames.\\" According to The New York Times, the conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney, \\"a hawkish policy analyst and commentator, who has been known to take polarizing positions\\", described the group as a \\"force multiplier\\" in promoting laws proposed by David Yerushalmi. ACT! members have introduced Yerushalmi's anti-foreign law bill (also known as anti-Sharia bill) in several state legislatures, accompanying it with \\"a public outreach blitz about the 'threat' of Sharia to America.\\" Gabriel has promoted the idea that there is an Islamic conspiracy in the United States, stating that \\"tens of thousands of Islamic militants now reside in America operating in sleeper cells, attending our colleges and universities, even infiltrating our government\\" and asserting that radicalized Muslims \\"have infiltrated us at the CIA, at the FBI, at the Pentagon, at the State Department.\\" ACT! has lobbied state and federal officials, seeking \\"to impact national security policy.\\" These officials include U.S. Representative Peter T.

ACT! for America does not believe, nor advocate, that all Muslims 'must be stopped.'\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center, called this a \\"whitewash\\" and in reply quoted statements from founder Brigitte Gabriel: > If a Muslim who has‚Äîwho is‚Äîa practicing Muslim who believes the word of the > Koran to be the word of Allah, who abides by Islam, who goes to mosque and > prays every Friday, who prays five times a day‚Äîthis practicing Muslim, who > believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the > United States of America. The Anti-Defamation League writes that while ACT!'s leadership denies holding bigoted views, \\"the group often argues against the distinction between radical and mainstream Islam\\". According to the ADL, ACT! had posted an article on its website titled \\"Stop Muslim immigration to the United States\\" and has promoted a petition demanding that the U.S. \\"stop all immigration into free countries by Muslims while we can\\" because \\"WE HAVE NO way of determining which Muslims subscribe to pure Islam.

The dam feeds the third largest hydroelectric power station in the country.  History  The dam under construction in 2007. The project was initially planned in 1968 by the local authorities, before the Government of Japan funded a study between 1985 and 1987 to further examine the hydroelectric potential in the upper reaches of Kotmale River. The feasibility study included five sites and eight alternative development schemes, and concluded with two sites which were more technically and economically feasible. The two sites were a conventional type at Caledonia, and a run-of-the-river type at Talawakele. The project at Caledonia involved the displacement of over 2,700 families and inundation of large areas of land used for tea plantations, and thus the Caledonia site was dropped. Further funding was then provided by Japan for the engineering study, which included a review of the feasibility study, selection of an optimal development plan, development of the detailed design, and the preparation of tender documents and an environmental impact assessment report. The environmental impact assessment report was completed in September 1994, with the final design report completed in March 1995. The environmental assessment identified key issues associated with the project, which includes impact on St. Clair's Falls aesthetics due to stream flow reductions, social impacts due to resettlement of affected people, possible effects on ground water due to tunnelling, impacts on downstream water uses due to de-watering of streams, and impacts on biodiversity. These impacts led large delays in project development. As per the National Environmental Act of 1998, the environmental clearance was then granted to the project. The project initially faced several objections, before being officially permitted by courts of law. Construction work on the project then began in 2006, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2011.  Construction and development  This project is estimated to cost a total of up to Rs.44 billion, of which Rs.5.931 billion was funded by the Ceylon Electricity Board, and ¬•33.265 billion by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The entire project covers an area of approximately , and is developed in five phases: * Phase 1: Site preparations, construction of employers and workers living quarters, construction of access roads, and relocation of affected people. * Phase 2: All key civil engineering works, such as construction of tunnel, dam, underground power house etc. This takes about 50% of the project cost. * Phase 3: Hydro-mechanical works such as construction of spillways, penstocks, intake gates, etc. * Phase 4: Electro- mechanical works such as generation installations, construction of the switchyard, fire fighting system, communication system, etc. * Phase 5: Construction of the double-circuit power transmission line. A total of 2,250 construction workers are employed at the site, of which 2,100 are locals, and 150 are foreign.  Dam and reservoir  Preparations upstream for the creation of the Upper Kotmale Reservoir. The gravity dam measures tall, and wide, impounding the Kotmale River and creating the Upper Kotmale Reservoir. Once filled, the reservoir will have a surface area of with an average storage capacity of . The minimum and maximum operating water levels are and AMSL respectively, while the tailwater level is AMSL. Water from the reservoir will be used for both irrigation development and hydroelectric power generation.  Tunnel  During the construction work of Headrace tunnel The diameter, long Upper Kotmale Tunnel, the longest excavated tunnel in Sri Lanka, will be used to deliver the water to the powerhouse. The tunnel begins at the dam site, and stretches north at a distance of approximately towards Pundaluoya, before stretching a further north-west towards Kumbaloluwa and ending up at its powerhouse at the Kotmale River near Niyamgamdora, at approximately , downstream of the confluence of Pundal River and the Kotmale River. Excavation on the tunnel was completed and ceremonially opened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on 4 November 2010.  Powerhouse  Underground Powerhouse during construction The powerhouse measures long, wide, and tall, and is located underground at Niyamgamdora. It has installed electrical capacity of from two turbines, capable of producing up to of power annually. Water arrives at the powerhouse from the dam via the long Upper Kotmale Tunnel, which then feeds the penstock. The initial of the penstock is single-lane, while the latter splits into two lanes, feeding the two generators respectively. The powerhouse consists of the two three-phase , vertical-axis Francis turbine-generators, two three-phase transformers, and a 220kV Gas Insulator Switchgear (GIS) substation. An outdoor switchyard measuring by .  Transmission line  The 220kV transmission line of the Upper Kotmale Hydro-power Project connects the power station located at Niyamgamdora, Kotmale, to the national grid via Kotmale switch yard located in Atabage, Gampola. The line consists of 45 towers and has a length of 15.5 km. The double circuit transmission line has a capacity of 220 MW per circuit.  Social and environmental impact  The construction of the dam, tunnel, and powerhouse, required the relocation of families from 495 houses. New homes were built away from the site with access to vital facilities such as water and power. The relocated families are provided with concessionary loans to start new self-employment ventures, while additional facilities such as the Talawakele Central College, places of worship, a cinema hall, a library, and a community centre, are being established. Similar most other dam's impacts on rivers around the world, the Upper Kotmale Dam will periodically stop the St. Clair's Falls, located downstream of the dam, and a further of the Kotmale River downstream of St. Clairs Falls, before the river is restored by water from the Devon River, the river forming the picturesque Devon Falls. As ordered by the Government Extraordinary, the St. Clair's waterfall will maintain a continuous flow of of water for 10 hours and 30 minutes daily, between sunrise and sunset.

Archinaco (born 1970) is an attorney known for the handling of the first virtual property lawsuit in the United States, Bragg v. Linden Research, Inc. That case is believed to have resolved confidentially. Archinaco also handled the case of John Carl v. AllianceBernstein and Lewis Sanders that resulted in a $12 million verdict for Carl in FINRA arbitration including $2 million in punitive damages. It is believed to be the largest single-Claimant paid verdict in FINRA history with no appeal ever being filed. Archinaco is also known for representing whistleblower Timothy P. Flynn against his former company UBS Financial Services Inc. In a complaint filed with the US Department of Labor, Flynn alleged that shortly after cooperating with regulators and providing testimony with regard to auction rate securities, he was retaliated against, being locked out of his office and forced to resign. UBS settled its auction rate securities issues with the State of Massachusetts for $37 million and $22 billion with the SEC, in addition to a fine of $150 million. The Flynn case drew national attention after the Department of Labor asked Flynn to prove that UBS Financial Securities was covered by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act since it was not a publicly traded entity, only a subsidiary of one. Subsequently, a number of Wall Street Journal articles were written by Jennifer Levitz, culminating in a joint letter written by Senators Patrick Leahy and Charles Grassley opposing the Department of Labor's restricted view of the Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower protections. In October 2010, Archinaco obtained a FINRA arbitration award of $925,000 for whistleblower Michelle Ford.

It was written by Jonathan Abrahams and series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner, and directed by Jennifer Getzinger. It aired originally on the AMC channel in the United States on August 8, 2010. The episode contained guest appearances by, among others, Melinda Page Hamilton as Anna Draper and Samuel Page as Greg Harris. In the episode, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) makes a trip to California to visit an old friend, where he receives bad news. Back in New York, he takes Lane Pryce (Jared Harris) out for a wild night on the town. Meanwhile, Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) is having problems both at work and at home. Advance copies of the episode were not sent to critics because of Weiner's fear of spoilers. Once the reviews came out, they were split on the value of the California storyline, but more consistent in lauding the comedy of Don and Lane's adventure. Plot It is the end of 1964, and Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is planning a holiday trip to Acapulco. On the way, he has a 24-hour stop-over in Los Angeles, to visit Anna Draper (Melinda Page Hamilton). He finds Anna ‚Äì the wife of the man whose identity Don stole ‚Äì on the porch with a broken leg. Anna's sister Patty (Susan Leslie) comes over to help with the chores, with her daughter Stephanie (Caity Lotz), who is in college. Stephanie stays behind when Patty leaves, and the three go out for dinner. In the evening, Don drives Stephanie home and makes a pass at her in her driveway. She turns him down and instead tells him that Anna has cancer but does not know it. Don decides to extend his visit, and the next morning, he angrily confronts Patty about the secrecy and says he will pay for any possible treatment. Patty replies that they have already consulted experts, who all agree the cancer is terminal and advanced. She asks him to stay out of the family's business and to leave before he inadvertently tells Anna the real story. Don reluctantly decides to acquiesce. He tells Anna he has to leave and returns to New York, instead of Acapulco. Before leaving, he paints over Anna's water stained wall, on which she paints a flower and he inscribes, \\"Dick + Anna '64\\". Meanwhile, Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) consults an OB/GYN about the possibility of getting pregnant, despite having had two prior abortions. He assures her there should be no problems but is puzzled by the timing, since her husband Greg (Samuel Page) will soon be shipped off to Vietnam. Back at the office, she asks Lane Pryce (Jared Harris) for time off in early January, since Greg is on duty over Christmas, but Lane brusquely refuses. Later, Joan is highly provoked to receive roses from Lane with a note saying: \\"Darling, I've been an ass. Kisses, Lane.\\" He assures her the note was intended for his wife, to whom he'd also sent roses, and hypothesizes that his secretary must have mixed up the cards; upon learning of the error Joan promptly fires Lane's secretary. At home, Greg tells Joan to take the time off anyway; the two argue, and he storms out. Later they make up, and Joan accidentally cuts her finger. Initially reluctant to have him treat it, and snippy about his statement that treating it, for him, is like filing papers for her (she corrects him to point out she works at a higher level than that now), Joan is ultimately impressed by his positive bedside manner and competence when he stitches the cut. Back in New York, on New Year's Day, Don encounters Lane in the office and takes him out for a movie and dinner. Lane confides that his wife has left him, and Don persuades him to come along and meet a couple of call girls. After meeting the girls at a comedy club, Lane spends the night in Don's apartment with one of the girls. In the morning he thanks Don for the \\"welcome distraction\\" and leaves. Back at the office, the executive staff convenes for a meeting. Joan opens with the words: \\"Gentlemen, shall we begin 1965?\\" Production After sending out advance copies of the season premiere to the media, Matthew Weiner was angered by what he considered spoilers in subsequent reviews. As a result, advance copies were not issued for later episodes. James Poniewozik, in his television blog for Time magazine, called AMC and Weiner's handling of the matter \\"insane\\". The channel released a promotional clip from the third episode containing a major plot detail, so in Poniewozik's opinion, they were contradicting the spoiler policy they were trying to force on others.The clip can be seen by U.S. residents on Fancast: In an interview with TV Guide given prior to the screening of \\"The Good News\\", actress Christina Hendricks revealed that her character Joan would figure more prominently in the fourth season than she had in the third. Hendricks saw Joan as someone who experienced \\"a lot of conflict at home\\", but still managed to put on a cheerful exterior at work, and be a stabilizing force in the often tumultuous workplace. She also believed that the new office layout reflected the importance of the office manager, where she was positioned in an office with glass walls on the middle of the floor, with a full view of everything going on. Historical error Although this episode takes place at the end of 1964, the film that Draper and Pryce see, Gamera: The Giant Monster was not released until 1965, and not released in the United States until 1966. Reception Jared Harris was praised by multiple commentators for his performance in the episode. On its original American broadcast on August 8, 2010, on AMC, the episode was viewed by 2.22 million people. The episode received very approving reviews from critics. Scott Tobias, reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, gave it a grade \\"A\\", calling it a \\"wonderful, tonally dexterous episode\\". He especially appreciated the \\"heartbreaking\\" scenes between Anna and Don, and the \\"fucking great\\" scenes with Don and Lane. Mark Dawidziak, of the Cleveland newspaper The Plain Dealer, also found the episode both \\"heartbreaking and humorous\\". He pointed to the scene with Don and Lane in the movie theater as the funniest one, and Don's goodbye to Anna as the most heartbreaking. Slate's John Swansburg was less impressed, writing: \\"For the first time this season, Mad Men bored me.\\" He found the return of Anna and the entire California story line unappealing. On the other hand, Swansburg enjoyed the \\"truly hilarious night of debauchery\\" Don and Lane enjoyed. Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for The New Republic, was even more scathing in his criticism, calling \\"The Good News\\" \\"The show's first truly bad episode.\\" He further termed it \\"easily the most awkwardly written, clumsily paced and disposable hour it has ever aired.\\" Though he did enjoy some parts of Don and Lane's night out, he found this also ultimately awkward, while he believed Christina Hendricks was not given enough screen time and good dialogue to fully play out the drama of her situation. Devon Thomas, reviewing the episode for CBS News, called the episode \\"strange\\", but appreciated the return of Joan to the story line. James Poniewozik of TIME magazine acknowledged the fact that viewers had previously been divided on the episodes of the show that have taken place in California. In this case, however, he appreciated the contrast, echoing Lane's words of \\"a welcome distraction\\". He also enjoyed seeing Jared Harris, in the role of Lane, having the chance to display a different side of his character. The New York Times' Ginia Bellafante felt the episode was not as \\"thematically tight\\" as the show at its best but reflected the view of other critics that it contained some of the most humorous scenes in the show's history. Bellafante, like Poniewozik, also commended Jared Harris for his performance. Meanwhile, Ben Kenigsberg pronounced himself a fan of the show's \\"Los Angeles interludes\\" in a Time Out Chicago review. He also enjoyed the \\"comic balance to the tragedy of the Anna announcement\\" provided by the night out in New York, as well as Joan's husband's \\"first non-loathsome scene\\".

Agents, and for his Marvel Comics on the series Secret Avengers, Superior Foes of Spider-Man, Avengers World, Ant-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man, as well as his controversial run on Captain America that culminated in the 2017 event comic Secret Empire Career While in college, Spencer wrote three pitches to Marvel Comics soon after the Marvel Knights imprint launched in 1998. According to Spencer, \\"Joe [Quesada] didn‚Äôt like the first two but the third one was a Black Cat pitch that was a Jackie Brown kind of Tarantino-esque thing. He said he liked that one but they weren‚Äôt going to do anything with anybody new at the time.\\" After another pitch was rejected, this time by Oni Press, Spencer went on to work in politics. He twice ran for the Cincinnati City Council as a candidate of the progressive Charter Party. Spencer also worked for a Democratic politician. He later moved to New York City and successfully pitched Existence 2.0 to Jim Valentino of Image Comics. The first issue was released in July 2009. A second miniseries, Existence 3.0, followed in November. In 2010, Paramount Pictures acquired the rights to Existence 2.0, and a film was in development through Platinum Dunes with Miles Millar and Alfred Gough to adapt and executive produce. Spencer also wrote Forgetless and Shuddertown at Image. An A.V. Club review of Shuddertown stated that Spencer \\"has become one of the finest practitioners\\" of crime noir in comics. Spencer's first ongoing series, Morning Glories, was released in August 2010, that same year, he wrote a seven-part Jimmy Olsen co-feature for DC Comics beginning in September's Action Comics #893, which concluded in a one-shot (released March 30, 2011), and a T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents monthly series that debuted that November. In 2011 he took over as the writer of Supergirl in January with issue #60, but DC announced two months later that he would only be co-scripting one issue. Spencer wrote Iron Man 2.0, a War Machine ongoing series for Marvel Comics which debuted that February. He also took over writing duties on Secret Avengers from Ed Brubaker with issue #13. It was announced at the 2011 Emerald City Comic Con that Spencer had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel, one that would allow him to continue writing his existing titles at both DC and Image. In 2011 Spencer was one of three writers that worked on Ultimate Comics Universe Reborn, a relaunch of Marvel Comics' Ultimate Marvel line, along with Jonathan Hickman and Brian Michael Bendis. Spencer wrote Ultimate Comics X-Men. In 2016 he become the writer of the ongoing series Captain America:Steve Rogers, in which Captain America has been replaced by a version of himself loyal to Hydra. In 2017, Spencer wrote the miniseries Secret Empire. The series was a commercial success, with issues #0 and 1 being the third best-selling comic books of April and May, respectively. In March 2018, it was announced that Spencer would be writing a relaunched Amazing Spider-Man series that would premiere that year, replacing long-time writer Dan Slott, as part of the Fresh Start relaunch that July.

It is characterized by enlargement of the posterior spinous processes of the lumbar spine, with normal intervertebral disc height and neuroforamina. The reason it is referred to as kissing spine is because the posterior spinous processes 'kiss' and touch one another as the individual goes into lumbar extension, for example when flat on their stomach. The condition has been seen in humans, canines, particularly with boxer breeds, and certain breeds of horses. This disorder is named after Christian Ingerslev Baastrup. Diagnosis Sagittal CT of the lumbar spine showing Baastrup's sign. The salient feature of the disorder is the exuberant osteophytosis that occurs at posterior lumbar spinous processes. Osteophytes are coarse calcifications at the edges of bone that form due to repetitive stress and trauma. There is also atrophy and fatty replacement of paraspinal musculature, which can be detected by CT or MRI. Treatment The malpositioning seen on radiography may not cause any symptoms at all. If there are related symptoms, however, therapeutic options include chiropractic care, physical therapy and nerve block injections. As a last resort, decompressive laminectomy may be attempted to relieve pain symptoms and remove the abnormally enlarged portions of bone.

The powers pursued Roberto Cofres√≠'s pirate flotilla in March 1825 because of the economic losses suffered by the parties to the pirates, as well as diplomatic concerns caused by their use of the flags of Spain and Gran Colombia which menaced the fragile peace between the naval powers. Several of those involved had been attacked by the freebooters. Among the diplomatic concerns caused by Cofres√≠ was a robbery carried out by several of his subordinates, the catalyst of an incident that threatened war between Spain and the United States known as \\"The Foxardo Affair\\", eventually leading to the resignation of his rival, pirate hunter David Porter. Sailing under the authorization of the Danish West Indies, the coalition employed two local ships, including a former victim of the pirates named San Jos√© y las Animas and USS of the West Indies Squadron. A ship from Gran Colombia, named La Invencible, also provided support during the initial stages. The final naval engagement took place on March 5, 1825, and began with a trap set at Boca del Infierno, a passage off Jobos Bay, Puerto Rico. The flagship of Cofres√≠'s flotilla, the sloop Anne (otherwise known as Ana), was baited by the set up. Surprised and outnumbered, the pirates abandoned the ship and escaped to shore, where they were captured by Puerto Rican authorities and placed on military trial. With the execution of Cofres√≠, the West Indies Anti-Piracy Operations were considered a success and he came to be known as \\"the last of the West India pirates\\". Background =Cofres√≠'s modus operandi= While still regarded as a Don, Cofres√≠ began his criminal life in Puerto Rico by leading a band of highway robbers which made a profit by assaulting farmers and merchants, from whom they would steal merchandise which was later sold by close friends and family. The government soon began a campaign to capture the gangs related to these crimes, most of which were from Cabo Rojo. It was another respected and wealthy man, Juan Bey, who first exposed Cofres√≠ as the man behind these bands while being prosecuted for murder. This led to the arrest of him and several collaborators, but he was able to escape. A fugitive on land, Cofres√≠ had already turned to piracy by 1823. Due to previous experience as a seafarer, he knew the geography of the region well and exploited this to his advantage. While on the run, the pirates would enter the adjacent Boquer√≥n Bay, which provides ample hiding spots through the mangroves and a cavern system that runs throughout its karst geography. The bay itself proved a strategic spot for the distribution of the plundered goods. Bahia de Tallaboa at Pe√±uelas and Bah√≠a de Jobos served as additional hideouts in the southern coast, being surrounded by a series of islets and coral reefs that are only navigable by small draft vessels. Additional options included shanty towns such as those employed by salt harvesters that littered Cabo Rojo, Guanica and Lajas. The actions of Cofres√≠ came close to starting a war between Spain and the United States due to the losses of the latter to pirate ships flying the flag of the former. Consequently, Governor Miguel de la Torre soon earned a particular interest in the actions of Cofres√≠ and was quoted stating that his name \\"gained celebrity due to his fearlessness and atrocities, [not even] the tranquil neighbor, the laborious merchant [or] the honest farmer felt safe from the claws of this criminal\\". In 1824, he enacted a series of measures that relegated the local criollos in favor of Spanish immigrants, minimizing the influence of the Ramirez de Arellano family. The newly arrived loyalists in turn responded by exposing the symbiosis that existed between this class and the pirates, soon establishing a prominent campaign to capture Cofres√≠. Despite the official posture on piracy and his bold actions, capturing Cofres√≠ would prove complicated, since he was already gathering a mythical reputation in Puerto Rico and becoming highly influential. Guayama's major, Francisco Brenes, documented how the pirates gathered several friends among the local population who would also protect them. His figure was held with such regard that some members of the higher classes were arrested due to their links with Cofres√≠. Cofres√≠ was said to exploit this in his favor, creating an underground circle that would share information with him. Despite his influence among the criollos, most of the pirate's close associates were black or mixed-race men in their 20s and early 30s who were incapable of thriving under the casta system, and instead opted to become thieves, murderers and other sorts of criminals. Such was the case of Jos√© \\"Pepe\\" Cartagena, Juan Antonio Delgado Figueroa, Jos√© de Rosario, Juan \\"El Indio\\" de los Reyes, Carlos D√≠az de la Concepci√≥n, Miguel \\"Beltr√°n\\" Ramos Ayala, Juan Carlos Ascencio de Torres, Torres Juan Francisco \\"Ceniza\\" Pizarro and Miguel \\"El Rasgado\\" de la Rosa. Others such as Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, Jaime M√°rquez, Pedro Alac√°n and Joaqu√≠n \\"El Campechano\\" Hern√°ndez had previously served aboard the privateering vessels Punta Pitre, La Fortuna, Josefa, Carmen and La Porte√±a. The real age of Hern√°ndez has been debated, since reports claim that he was either Cofres√≠'s cabin boy or an older man, with the latter being most likely. Following a series of diplomatic disputes, the issue of letters of marque by Spain was suspended during the final months of 1823, which fueled the recruitment of experienced sailors into the crew. =Relevant attacks= On June 9, 1824, Cofres√≠ boarded a schooner named San Jos√© y Las Animas near Pe√±uelas, Puerto Rico. The vessel was fully loaded and carried over 6,000 pesos. The ship, property of Santos Lucca, was captained by Francisco Ocasio and was ferrying the cargo for a third party, the Mattei family. On that day, it was completing a journey between Saint Thomas and Puerto Rico, which was its usual route. Ocasio reacted to the attack by sailing towards land and allowing his guests to disembark, but was unable to outmaneuver the pirates, who quickly boarded and stole all but a scant portion of the merchandise. The routes between Puerto Rico and the Danish West Indies would become a favored target for attacks, focusing on ships from the islands of Saint Thomas and Saint Croix. The assaults that Cofres√≠'s flotilla led against international vessels soon attracted the attention of the West Indies Squadron, which began pursuing him after the capture of the American merchant vessels named John and William Henry. At the height of this search, the schooners , and were patrolling the waters of Puerto Rico. Despite this, Cofres√≠ was undeterred and instead adopted a strategy of using the speed of its vessels to potshot the military ships. On the evening of January 25, 1825, while Sloat scouted the west coast on Grampus, the pirates intercepted it. Cofres√≠ then commanded a bold attack, threatening the military crew with musket fire and demanding that it drop sails. When Grampus retaliated, the pirates outsailed the schooner and docked at Naguabo, Puerto Rico, where they continued their plundering streak. The crew of Grampus tried to track them, but after failing to locate anyone in hours abandoned the area. On February 10, 1825, Cofres√≠ boarded a sloop named Neptune while it was docked at Jobos Bay. The pirates ambushed the merchant sloop's crew, led by its owner, Salvador Pastoriza, by firing muskets at it. The merchant was able to escape from the ship amidst the gunfire, but was injured and witnessed as the pirates looted Neptune. After completing this task, Cofres√≠ commandeered the sloop out of the Bay and assimilated it into his flotilla. Neptune was then used in the attack on two Danish vessels, property of W. Furniss, once again disrupting the trade of the Danish West Indies. By targeting this route the pirates directly affected merchant Juan Bautista Pierety, who worked several routes between the ports of Guayama, Salinas, Ponce and Saint Thomas. Besides being the owner of several of Cofres√≠'s victims, he reported personally seeing part of the pirate's flotilla, a sloop and schooner, docked at Boca del Infierno. On February 15, 1825, Cofres√≠ led the attack on another Danish sloop named Anne at Quebrada de Palmas port in Naguabo. The pirates employed the same tactic as before, surprising the crew while they were distracted with the cargo. Cofres√≠ then mugged Annes captain, Beagles navigator John Low, stealing $20 from him. The ship's crew was forced to leap overboard and were left behind while the pirates commandeered the vessel. =Foxardo (Fajardo) Affair= On October 24, 1824, the second-in-command of Cofres√≠'s fleet, Bibi√°n Hern√°ndez Morales, led a group of pirates to the Danish colony of Saint Thomas. There they plundered an establishment named Cabot, Bailey & Company, carrying 5,000 dollars in loot and returning to Puerto Rico. Aware of the incident, Charles T. Platt of the West Indies Squadron left that port aboard Beagle two days later, accompanied by one of the affected merchants. The vessel first encountered the pirates off Vieques, but was unable to capture any. However, they were able to gather information that led them to Fajardo. Upon arriving there, Platt, who was not wearing a uniform, explained his operation to the port captain through a translator. The crew was then taken before Mayor Francisco Caro and handed him a letter (originally intended for an associate of the merchant named Juan Campos) with the details of the robbery, but the functionary ordered a search of his ship and documents. Platt left the vicinity in protest and walked towards Beagle, but was arrested along with Midshipman Robert Ritchie and categorized as a suspect himself, being held prisoner under the supervision of the town's mayor. While this happened, some of the stolen goods were tracked to Naguabo with the help of Campos (who was later uncovered as a double agent and one of Cofres√≠'s cohorts). Hours later, the process to transfer him to a local jail was completed, but Platt offered resistance and threatened to fight back. This was followed by more delays, but the crew of Beagle was ultimately allowed to leave port without further repercussions. Upon returning to Saint Thomas, Platt quickly contacted Commodore David Porter and presented his account of the events at Fajardo. After interviewing all of the involved, the officer concluded that the mayor and his subordinates were in fact buying time for the pirates, in the process allowing the mobilization of loot to a less conspicuous location. Shortly afterwards, the local Consular Agent Stephen Cabot brought him reports that Campos had bought the stolen goods. Incensed by this revelation, Porter ordered that an unsanctioned expedition was to leave port. The commodore led the flotilla aboard the frigate , and was joined by Grampus and Beagle. Porter arrived at Fajardo on November 14, 1824, and delivered a letter demanding an explanation to the local authorities. In this missive, the commodore also warned that, if ignored, he would march with his troops to the town within an hour, and that if the military tried to defend it, the result would be the \\"total destruction\\" of Fajardo. However, the Spanish authorities took the action as an attack and began arming the port's artillery. Noticing this, Porter sent sailors to disable it and subsequently commanded the landing of two hundred additional marines. The division marched onwards until they halted at the town's entrance, where the Spanish stood ready to defend it. Aware that the diplomatic crisis could lead to a full blown war between Spain and the United States and still within the grace period, the mayor and the captain of the port arrived at the scene and offered apologies to Platt and Porter. The marines were then directed to march to the vessels and returned to Saint Thomas. The local United States ambassador soon received confirmation of Campos's real allegiance. The Spanish government then took further actions to prevent repercussions, removing both the mayor and the captain of the port from their offices, and beginning a process to purge the accomplices of the pirates. The government of the United States did its part to control the damage, and Porter was soon placed on court-martial. Preparations =Victims of Cofres√≠ rendezvous in St. Thomas= The arrival of Low at his home base of St. Thomas coincided with the visit of USS Grampus. Shortly afterwards, a vessel arrived from Puerto Rico, its captain having seen Cofres√≠'s flagship at Vieques. Upon learning of the incident and with the current whereabouts of the pirates known, Sloat made a request to the port authorities in St. Thomas and was able to find three captains willing to help in the mission. Two men from Puerto Rico, Salvador Pastoriza and Pierety, volunteered their ships, which also possessing Danish documents could sail from that port. After his request was met, Sloat held a reunion with the governor of St.Thomas, Peter Carl Frederik von Scholten. The captain pleaded for authorization to launch an expedition to Puerto Rico and Vieques from the port of St. Thomas, also appealing for the use of the three sloops. Aware that both the Danish and American navies had been unsuccessfully searching for Cofres√≠ and shared a common interest, the governor conceded the use of the ships. Furthermore, these were the same pirates that had captured and commandeered the sloops Neptune and Anne (both operating under Danish papers, but based at St.Thomas), attacked another sailing off St. Croix, and sacked several local stores during an incident. The only demand of the Danish government was that they were to be used only for this mission. Preparations were quickly completed, and no new incidents occurred during this period. Sloat delegated command of the two Spanish ships to lieutenants Garrett J. Pendergrast and Wilson, assigning 20 sailors per sloop. The former boarded Pierety's ship, the pirates' former victim San Jos√© y Las Animas. Hearing the news, the captain of a Colombian brigantine named La Invencible requested to join, being granted a place in the mission. The command of the third ship was granted to a sailor of this ship, who brought along part of the Colombian crew and weapons. Due to his familiarity with both the pirates and Anne, Low was recruited into the crew. Pierety, on the other hand, contributed his knowledge of the geography to aid in directing the search. To aid in the mission, governor von Scholten ordered that no vessels could leave the St. Thomas port during the following days, drastically reducing the maritime traffic and preventing any of Cofres√≠'s associates from reaching him in time. With preparations in place, the expedition left port before the dawn of March 1, 1825. =Coastal search and Cofres√≠'s audacity= The flotilla arrived at Vieques at dawn. The sloops were then sent north, where they investigated potential hideouts used by the pirates. Grampus remained along with La Invencible and monitored the adjacent waters. The initial search did not bring any novelties, and the American marines were transported from the sloops to Grampus to spend the night. After coming short the first day, the search was moved to the western coast of Vieques and the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. Meeting the same result, the marines once again moved back into Grampus. On March 3, 1824, the expedition moved to the southeast coast of Puerto Rico and sailed west, investigating several geographic features that could provide a natural haven for Cofres√≠. Unfruitful, the flotilla prepared to dock at Ponce during the evening. However, La Invencible abandoned the mission shortly before docking. With Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's campaign against Spain raging on, the vessel could have been considered an enemy and its crew risked being taken as prisoners or losing the ship if they arrived at a Spanish colony. Grampus and two of the sloops landed, with San Jos√© y Las Animas arriving an hour later. After being allowed to rest, the sailors were allowed to disembark and buy supplies. At ten in the morning, while they were carrying out these tasks, Cofres√≠ nonchalantly sailed in front of the port's entrance while heading east. Pierety and Low confirmed the identity of the vessel with some of the locals: it was Anne. By this time, Cofres√≠ was already aware of the mission, but believed that the expedition had since returned to St.Thomas, failing to notice their presence in time. Now aware of the proximity of the pirates, the Spanish authorities and Sloat established a strategy that placed troops on land while the flotilla engaged them at sea. Sloat requested help from mayor Jos√© de Torres and the military commander of southern Puerto Rico, Tom√°s de Renovales, which was promptly granted. The task of organizing the militia troops of the adjacent municipalities of Salinas, Pastillas and Guayama was relegated to captain Manuel Marcano. Renovales himself doubled the patrol of the coastal towns. Once again, Pierety volunteered San Jos√© y Las Animas for the impending engagement and had help from subdelegate Salvador Blanch Castell√≥, who armed the ship with a six-pound cannon and rounded up volunteers. Sloat provided weapons for the new arrivals and assigned additional forces, including medic Samuel Biddle and lieutenants Pendergrast and George A. Magruder, for a total of 23 sailors. Lastly, Low was brought on board San Jos√© y Las Animas, where he was joined by a fellow victim of the pirates, Antonetty. This ship was the first to leave port around 4:00 p.m. with a route that extended from Fajardo to Ponce. At dawn, Grampus and one of the Danish sloops sailed towards Caja de Muerto. The second vessel was commanded by lieutenant Wilson and Pastoriza was among its crew. San Jos√© y las Animass trap and naval engagement An aerial view of Jobos Bay depicts Boca del Infierno (the leftmost passage). On March 5, 1825, San Jos√© y las Animas was in the process of scouting the coast when Low recognized Anne sailing off Jobos Bay. Cofres√≠ was leaving one of his most enduring hideouts and was traversing Boca del Infierno, a channel leading into Jobos Bay that is located between two keys, Cayo Caribes and Cayos de Barca. Pendergrast decided to set up a trap by posing as a merchant vessel, ordering all of his marines and the Spanish militiamen to lie down on the deck and wait, ready to open fire. Cofres√≠, unaware that the military was employing sloops in his search, assumed that it was a merchant ship and ordered his crew to approach it. When Anne was close enough, Pendergrast ordered the troops to fire the cannon and empty their rifles. Cofres√≠ was surprised by the trap, but soon realized the situation and ordered a retaliation, firing his own cannon and having his crew return musket fire. The crew of San Jos√© y las Animas then signaled the Spanish troops on land. While the Spanish ship pursued Anne, Cofres√≠ employed evasive tactics and answered with multiple waves of musket fire. The naval engagement lasted for 45 minutes, during which San Jos√© y las Animas exploited the offensive position that it had gained during the surprise attack, damaging the mast and hull of Anne. Having been injured along with Juan Carlos Torres and Juan Manuel de Fuentes during the initial bewilderment, Cofres√≠ ordered his crew to turn towards Playa de los Rodeos with the intention of escaping inside the adjacent mangroves and swamp. Two members of his crew were killed before Anne landed (one of them identified as Portalat√≠n). San Jos√© y las Animas then directed its cannon to fire at the shore, managing to hit and kill pirate Juan de Mata with a shot to the midsection. Cofres√≠ himself was able to escape inland, but his crew were scattered. Thanks to their surprise attack, the crew of the Spanish sloop suffered no casualties. Minutes later, the now abandoned Anne was claimed by the marine troops. San Jos√© y las Animas sailed towards the adjacent Jobos shipyard, where Antonetty disembarked, alerted the Spanish troops stationed there, and mobilized the civilians to help in the search for the escaped pirates. Aftermath =Capture of Cofres√≠= Shortly afterwards, Pierety proceeded to make an inventory of Annes cargo. On board the military found Spanish and Danish papers, a four-pound cannon, several muskets and guns, sabers and shaving blades. Pierety also led the refloating of Anne. As soon as the news reached the coast, the militias led by captain Manuel Marcano sprang into action. At Guayama, the local troops began a search throughout the municipality. Parallel to this, mayor Francisco Brenes and Eugenio de Silvia, the subdelegate of the navy, did the same. Around 10:00 p.m. the first three pirates were caught. Another named Vicente Carbajal was found alone, still armed with a rifle. Through the search, Brenes acted in coordination with his colleague from Patillas, Tom√°s P√©rez Guerras. Accompanied by two members of his crew, Cofres√≠ managed to remain a fugitive until the next day. However, their pace was affected by the hostility of the swampy terrain. Near midnight, a Puerto Rican mulatto named Juan Candido Garay spotted Cofres√≠ and his crew. Joined by fellow militiamen Domingo de Rivera, Mat√≠as Qui√±ones and Juan Rodr√≠guez, the group ambushed the pirates. Cofres√≠ and his cohorts tried to flee through the brush. But, slowed down by the injuries suffered on the engagement, he was unable to avoid a blunderbuss shot from Garay that hit his left arm. Despite being knocked down by the blast, the pirate was able to stand up and retrieve a knife. However, the remaining militiamen intervened and attacked Cofres√≠ at once with machetes, leaving him severely injured. The same tactic was used on one of his cohorts. The noise attracted reinforcements led by Eugenio de Silva, who were then joined by captain Luis S√°nchez, the man commissioned by Brenes to capture the pirates. The group was completed by captain Manuel S√°nchez and corporal Jos√© Mar√≠a Bernab√©. However, the military commander of Ponce, Manuel Marcano, was the one credited by the government for the work of Garay and the rest of the militiamen, although he had never arrived at the scene. Due to their race, governor Miguel de la Torre only granted a silver medal and a certificate recognizing their work to the Puerto Rican militiamen. After arriving at the Guayama jail, doctor Francisco Ros√≥ tended Cofres√≠'s wounds and declared that he would not die from them. Cofres√≠ was bound from hands and feet, while the prison guard was multiplied to a troop of 25. Along with him, Antonio Delgado, Carlos D√≠az, Victoriano Salda√±a, Manuel Aponte, Agust√≠n de Soto, Carbabal, and Vicente Ximenez were held. Marcano was left in charge of the prisoners. Brenes provided medicines to ensure that the pirates survived long enough to stand trial. While the mayor was overseeing his treatment, Cofres√≠ held a reunion with him, offering the sum of 4,000 pesos (31.25 pounds of silver) for his liberty. However, the mayor declined and promptly reported the event. Six militiamen guarded the pirates until their transfer to San Juan, Puerto Rico could be approved. Two more pirates, Juan Carlos de Torres and Juan Manuel de Fuentes, were caught on March 7, 1825. Both were injured, although the former carried with him some money, razors, ammunition and a faux pearl necklace. Two days later, Marcano was assigned to escort Cofres√≠ and other of his pirates to the mayor's mansion. During his journey through the Cordillera Central, he was carried on a stretcher while still recovering from his injuries. In each town, the task of carrying him was assigned to a new party of eight militiamen. The party was heavily guarded due to fears that associates or civilian sympathizers may set Cofres√≠ free, a concern expressed by Brenes when communicating with the other mayors. The final members of his crew were caught during the following weeks. On March 11, 1825, Jos√© Rodr√≠guez was caught while being harbored by two corrupt militiamen. Ten days later the last member of the crew, a former slave simply named Carlos, was arrested while hiding in a hacienda. At the moment of this arrest, he was carrying of gold. =Trial and execution= On March 6, 1825, San Jos√© y las Animas towed Anne to the Ponce port. As news of the incident spread fast, the ship's arrival was met by a large congregation of spectators, among whom were several local officers. The Spanish authorities tried to host Pendergrast for a celebration, but he declined the offer, noting that he had orders to return to St. Thomas with Anne as soon as it was captured. The lieutenant was only in port enough time to deal with bureaucratic processes and help move the cannons. Despite this, the authorities staffed his vessel with provisions and replaced the spent ammunition. Pendergrast and the American marines were transported to St. Thomas during this trip. The group systematically examined the coasts during their journey, but failed to locate more pirates. On March 11, 1825, San Jos√© y las Animas arrived at St. Thomas port, where the crew met Sloat and notified him of Cofres√≠'s capture. The following morning, the results were notified to the Secretary of the Navy and to governor Von Scholten. Sloat then gathered the witness accounts of Pastoriza and Low, which were sent along with the official report to the United States, where Porter faced trial for illegally invading Fajardo. On March 13, 1825, Low gave an account of Annes hijacking off St. Thomas as part of his attempt to recover his ship. Shortly afterwards, Grampus set sail to San Juan. There, Sloat offered De la Torre the testimony of his men, but the governor noted that Cofres√≠ and his crew were already guilty by default, having never denied that they were pirates. The captain then visited the pirate in his cell, asking if he had taken any American vessels, to which he answered that he would have done so had an opportunity arisen. The exterior of Castillo San Felipe del Morro's chapel On March 17, 1825, the authorities began a military trial against Cofres√≠ and ten of his cohorts. Due to measures enacted by governor De la Torre, any trial for piracy could only be resolved as a case of foreign privateering, thus preventing a civilian case. That same day the interrogation of Cofres√≠ took place, overseen by prosecutor Jos√© Madrazo. According to the government's gazette, the pirate confessed to the capture of a French sloop, a Danish schooner, a small boat from St. Thomas, a brigantine and schooner from the Dominican Republic, an American schooner and two local vessels. As the process was beginning, Sloat returned to Grampus and set sail. That same day, the French frigate La Ninfa and schooner Gazelle reached port. Like Sloat before them, the French officers visited De la Torre and the pirates. Half a dozen additional accomplices were caught and transported to the prison during this period. On March 27, 1825, the military trial determined that the sentence for their transgression was death, the first time that a purely local process (held at San Juan without the consent of the West Indies Council) had led to this verdict for the crime of piracy. The military also felt that this minimized the budget of the process and prevented overpopulation in the jail, something that would be expected given the quantity of associates which helped the pirates. The only exception was Carlos, who was assigned to a slavery auction. The day before the execution, the pirates were granted their final wish and were confessed by Catholic priests. Wanting to make an example of Cofres√≠, the government placed proclamations throughout the city. On March 29, 1825, the pirates were allowed to go to attend a mass at El Morro's chapel while the Granada Infantry Battalion prepared the grounds. Cofres√≠ was then escorted to the execution grounds before a large crowd, where he was blindfolded. After one last act of defiance from their captain, the pirates were executed by a firing squad. News of the event was published in the local government's gazette, along with a warning for anyone interested in piracy. The press of the United States heavily publicized these events, while Porter's trial continued. However, despite arguing that Fajardo had turned into a pirate's nest and that the complicity of the authorities made them enemies, Porter was found guilty and in turn resigned his commission and defected. =Long term repercussions= Since Cofres√≠'s contacts extended throughout the west, south and east coasts of Puerto Rico, the authorities continued investigating and arresting people that were considered to have been associates of the pirates. There were so many linked to Cofres√≠, that this process extended for more than a decade. Due to their connections, both of his brothers were jailed between 1824 and 1826. The sudden disappearance of Neptune gathered the attention of the authorities, and shortly after the capture of the pirates, a similar vessel sailing under the name Neptuno was traced sailing alongside a schooner named Mar√≠a, property of Pedro Alac√°n. This man had collaborated with the authorities in several of its incursions against Cofres√≠, including a highly publicized mission to Mona on June 22, 1824. For his work in this operation and lending his sloop Avispa (which was reportedly lost in a storm during the voyage), Alac√°n received a military recognition and was restituted with a pirate vessel confiscated at Mona. However, as soon as a connection to the fate of Neptune was established, he was arrested along with other members of that foray. The reason behind the contradictory actions of Alac√°n following the mission at Mona and his subsequent association with Cofres√≠ remain unclear. Among the possibilities explored by historian Walter Cardona Bonet are that Avispa was never lost, but given to the pirates, and that his involvement in the mission was to ensure that they escaped. It is likely that the association with Alac√°n began after Juan Francisco was arrested, with his taking over the distribution of contraband. During his time in jail, Salda√±a confessed the location of Del Rosario, De la Rosa and Pizarro. De la Torre ordered an expedition to Vieques to capture them. However, the mission failed, with Ramos offering haven to two of the pirates. Manuel Ramos, a cousin of De los Reyes, had provided refuge and protection from the authorities. Del Rosario Centeno was not on the island by this time, instead hiding at Naguabo. De los Reyes was later arrested at the same location during the summer of 1825. Pizarro was also believed to hide here or at the adjacent property of another associate named Guillermo Opio, eventually moving to Africa to work in slave trading. Merchant Juan de Arce was also captured in Naguabo after his figure was linked to Cofres√≠ by the military commander of Vieques, Antonio Rosell√≥, who identified that one of his ships was in service of the pirates. Jos√© Salvador Pardo Figueroa and Manuel Xim√©nez were also brought from Vieques as suspects. De la Rosa was arrested during this period. Jaime M√°rquez escaped to St. Thomas, where he was pursued for planning a mutiny aboard the Spanish schooner Dorada and arrested in December 1825 for stealing the sloop L'Amadea. Juan Geraldo Bey was sought after as a pirate for his association with Cofres√≠, remaining fugitive until January 1826. Ramos was captured at Vieques on October 13, 1826, after allegedly trying to recruit sailors for piracy. Juan Pe√±a, the former captain of Mar√≠a, was arrested as an accomplice of the pirates in February 1827, this despite not being involved in the incident with Neptune. Parallel to this, Del Rosario was arrested for other crimes, dying while serving his sentence. During the following years, a number of associates were arrested and died in jail including Juan Ramos, Juan Gufao, Jos√© Correa, Antonio Carreras and Manuel Ramos. Another suspect, Jos√© del Rosario died in jail for another crime before he could be prosecuted for his association with Cofres√≠. Reyes Paz and Gallardo escaped Puerto Rico and boarded a slaver's ship at St. Thomas, but they were discovered and sent to San Juan, where they were subjected to trial. Morales Hern√°ndez remained fugitive until 1839, when he was caught in Naguabo and executed with the garrote. Official recounts and media coverage =Sloat's report= The American version states that Commander Sloat solicited permission for the use of two small ships after becoming aware of Cofres√≠'s latest actions. After becoming acquainted with Cofres√≠, John Low was brought in along the crew. The report claims that Sloat was aware of an evasion strategy that was used by the pirates to escape when pursued by large ships, which consisted of traveling as close to the coast as possible in small draft vessels, thereby avoiding being followed. Therefore, he used the small ships in order to pursue them while attempting this strategy. Both vessels were armed and began working in an exploratory manner, traveling through several ports and coastal towns. On the third day while sailing near Ponce, Dolphin located a ship in Boca del Infierno and identified it as Anne. When Cofres√≠ saw the ship, he confused it with a merchant vessel, since it was not flying its actual colors, and ordered his crew to attack. Armed with a four- pounder cannon, Anne approached the ship, but the crew revealed that it was a military vessel by hoisting the Navy jack and opened fire. The subsequent exchange lasted forty-five minutes and ended when the pirates abandoned their ship and swam to the nearby beach. Vicente Antoneti, who was traveling in Bautista Pierety's boat, disembarked and notified the local Spanish military unit about the event. Two of the pirates died in the battle and six others, including Cofres√≠, were injured. Sloat estimated that Cofres√≠ had lost a third of his crew in the previous exchange, based on the number of bodies on the water surrounding the boat. Aboard Anne they found several muskets, guns, cutlasses and knives. The sloop was then sailed towards St. Thomas, arriving there by March 11, 1825. Cofres√≠ was ultimately caught after receiving a blunderbuss injury to his left arm and was subdued with a hit from a carbine's stock. =Renovales' report= Most of the discrepancies between the Spanish account and Sloat's report originate from colonel Renovales of the Southern District's Command, who issued his report after personally hosting Pendergrast. On March 1, 1825, the mayor of Guayama was informed that a suspicious sloop was anchoring at Boca del Infierno. According to this version, Renovales himself requested the service of three vessels the following day. The most notable boats of this excursion were San Jos√© y Las Animas, loaned for the mission, and Grampus, which belonged to the United States. According to the officer, the strategy to capture the pirates was developed by Jos√© Ort√≠z de la Renta, the mayor of the municipality of Ponce, and himself. The mayor is also credited with the initiative of recruiting Sloat to command the reconnaissance mission. Renovales uses the Spanish name of both ships in its report, also stating that lieutenant Pendergrast was not in command of San Jos√© y las Animas. Renovales also claims Centeno as the owner of Anne, without mention of Low. Three American officers and a doctor accompanied Sloat in this mission. Pendergrast, George A. Magrades and Francis Store plus a crew of twenty-three sailors were assigned to the mission. The sailors were heavily armed and a new cannon was mounted on the ship. On the afternoon of the third day one of the ships located Cofres√≠, near the entrance of Boca del Infierno. When the pirates spotted the vessel San Jos√© y Las Animas, they confused it with a merchant ship and proceeded to attack it. The crew of the ship hid until the pirates were within shooting distance, when they opened fire. Both vessels exchanged cannon fire. Cofres√≠ commanded Ana to go near land, but was forced to disembark in the coast and to retreat into a nearby forestal area. Later that day the mayor of the town of Los Jobos issued a statement which detailed the pirates' entrance into the beach, and he subsequently notified the local authorities about the event. A search operation was launched and during the dusk hours six pirates were captured. The Spanish government then sent military personnel to block all the roads and plains surrounding the area. Two of the search groups believed that the pirates would have to pass through a certain road in order to escape and planned to ambush them there. The pirates reached the location at 10:30 p.m. and tried to escape, but were intercepted. According to Renovales, Manuel S√°nchez de Ortiz and a group of militiamen found Cofres√≠ and two cohorts near Patillas that night. Cofres√≠ tried to defend himself with a knife, but his injury facilitated their capture. Juan Garay is still credited for disabling his arm with the blunderbuss during their confrontation. His injuries were severe, but a doctor declared that they were not lethal. The rest of the crew was captured by the police departments of Patillas and Guayama on March 7 and 8. The names of the known crewmembers are Juan Carlos de Torres and Santiago D√≠az. Both men exhibited recent gun wounds, with the former still carrying fifteen Spanish coins, handkerchiefs, two faux pearl necklaces, a list written in English, two earrings, two razors and three bullets, among other things. =Press accounts= Details of the trials were suppressed locally, with only the government's La Gaceta de Puerto Rico publishing its account. This result was highly suspicious due to the Caribbean press' high interest in piracy, suggesting a media blackout or coverup. Despite this, the United States press quickly acted to propagate its knowledge of the case in order to influence the Porter trial, since he justified his invasion by claiming that Puerto Rico had become a Government-sanctioned pirate's nest. By April, newspapers such as The Maryland Gazette were reprinting the government's account of the events. On May 28, 1825, the Gaceta de Madrid published an article where De la Torre is quoted praising the local effort and noting the \\"sleepless nights\\" that were spent due to \\"[his] government's interest\\" to \\"exterminate [the pirates].\\" In 1846, Boston Traveller reporter Freeman Hunt elaborates and recounts that upon landing ashore, Cofres√≠ employed sly tactics to avoid the soldiers, first exploiting the chaos to evade the cavalry and then stealing the clothes and animals from a herdsman. The pirate then hid in plain sight by directing the herd towards the soldiers and scattering them away by providing false information about the location of his crew while unrecognized. Hunt notes that Cofres√≠ was close to escaping, but a child present at the last guard post recognized him due to bilateral syndactyly, forcing him to run and be wounded by a shot to the neck. Despite bleeding, the pirate recovered quickly and unfurled his knife, gaining an upper hand until more soldiers were attracted by the noise. One of them hit Cofres√≠ with the stock of a carbine, taking advantage that he was still struggling with the first. His hands were then bound and his feet were fastened to a horse. Hunt claims that despite his injuries, Cofres√≠ was placed in iron handcuffs and that a soldier was assigned to his bedside. Other unusual precautions were reportedly taken due to his reputation, including the doubling of guards throughout the prison and an \\"officer [being] made responsible with his head for the [fate] of the prisoner\\". Hunt states that during this arrest the pirate narrated his life, explained his motivations and also boasted about his athletic capacity by claiming to have been \\"the most active man\\" and \\"best runner on the island\\". In 1923, Francis B. C. Bradlee provided a different account of the events, crediting Sloat with the capture of Anne. The journalist claims that a different crew served aboard the merchant sloop, with Andrew Hull Foote acting as midship-man along 23 sailors. Bradlee mentions that Cofres√≠ opened fire and that Sloat ordered the counterattack with a twelve-pound carronade. The report correctly quotes the 45-minute exchange, that left two of the pirates dead and the grounding of Anne. The journalist also expresses his amusement that ten of the pirates were captured by the Spanish. Bradlee concluded his account erroneously, stating that Cofres√≠ was executed with the garrote.

It is a subfield of forestry and plant pathology. Forest pathology is part of the broader approach of forest protection. Insects, diseases and severe weather events damaged about 40 million ha of forests in 2015, mainly in the temperate and boreal domains. Abiotic factors There are a number of abiotic factors which affect the health of a forest, such as moisture issues like drought, winter-drying, waterlogging resulting from over-abundance or lack of precipitation such as hail, snow, rain. Wind is also an important abiotic factor as windthrow (the uprooting or breaking of trees due to high winds) causes an obvious and direct loss of stability to a forest or its trees. Often, abiotic factors and biotic factors will affect a forest at the same time. For example, if wind speed is 80 km per hour then many trees which have root rot (caused by a pathogen) are likely to be thrown. Higher wind speeds are necessary to damage healthier trees. Fire, whether caused by humans or lightning, and related abiotic factors also affect the health of forest. The effects of man often alter a forest's predisposition to damage from both abiotic and biotic effects. For example, soil properties may be altered by heavy machinery. ;Other abiotic factors *Nutrient imbalances: deficiencies, chemicals (toxic salts, herbicides, air pollutants) *Stemflow which can concentrate dry deposits which via soil acidification can kill surrounding plants. *Temperature Biotic factors *Fungi: Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Fungi imperfecti There is a category listing fungal tree pathogens and diseases in Wikipedia. *Oomycota: Phytophthora *Bacteria *Phytoplasmas *Viruses ;Insects There is a category listing insect pests of temperate forests in Wikipedia. *Ips (genus) bark beetles *Bark beetle *Ambrosia beetle *Cerambycidae *Black arches Some of these factors act in concert (all do to a degree). For example, Amylostereum areolatum is spread by the sirex woodwasp. The fungus gains access to new trees to live off, and the woodwasp larvae gain food. Parasitic flowering plants Many plants can parasitize trees via root to root contact. Many of these parasitic plants originate in the tropical and subtropical climates. Animals Nematodes, insects especially bark beetles, mammals may browse. Browsing can be prevented with tree shelters. Humans and other mammals predate on trees, and on unsustainable, especially industrial scales, these are demonstrably pathological to the forest. Additionally, poorly planned but conventionally replanted (post-cut) forest plantations are typically monocropped, and highly susceptible to further insect or fungal infection due to low biodiversity and diminished capacity for community resilience - see the \\"Wood wide web\\". Part of forest pathology is forest entomology. Forest entomology includes the study of all insects and arthropods, such as mites, centipedes and millipedes, which live in and interact in forest ecosystems. Forest entomology also includes the management of insect pests that cause the degrading, defoliation, crown die-back or death of trees. Thus the scope is wide and includes: * Documentation of all insect species and related arthropods in natural and man-made forests, and the study and ecology of those species. * Description and assessment of damage to tree structures (parts of a tree), to forest stands, landscape effects and to wood products, timber in service and other ecosystem services. * Eradication of recently introduced pests, or long-term management of established exotics and indigenous pests, to minimise losses in wood quality and wood production, and to reduce tree mortality. * Assessments of forest operations, or of management impacts, on the invertebrate fauna, and the alleviation of any adverse effects on these invertebrates.Christian Stauffer, Lecture on Forest Protection 2013, Institute of Forest Entomology, Forest Pathology and Forest Protection, Department of Forest and Soil Sciences, University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, Hasenauerstra√üe 38, A-1190 Vienna.  Hazard trees  The likelihood of property damage or personal injury due to tree failure. Hazard includes not only the tree's condition, but the potential target as well. Rating systems, procedures and guidelines have been developed for decision making but knowledge, judgement, and experience are an important part to the process. Pathogens that affect trees There is a category listing tree diseases in Wikipedia. * Armillaria, which causes white rot root disease * Cenangium * Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, which causes Ash Dieback * Heterobasidion annosum, which causes Annosum or red root rot, the economically most significant pathogen in the Northern hemisphere. * Chestnut blight * Rickettsia, which causes possibly this citrus greening disease * Spiroplasma * Dutch elm disease * Ink disease * Emerald ash borer * Olive tree pathology * Witch's broom * White Pine Blister Rust * Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes root rot * Phytophthora ramorum, which causes sudden oak death * Polypore or bracket fungus * Tinder conk Signs and symptoms Symptoms are a result of a pathogen: * Blight * Burl * Canker * Chlorosis * Drunken trees * Forest dieback * Gall * Girdling * Leaf scorch * Root rot * Virescence * Wilt disease Signs are the visible presence of a part of a pathogen: * Ascus is a part of an ascomycota fungus. * Conk (fungi) is the fruiting body of a bracket fungus. * Hypha are collectively called a mycelium * Mycelial cord or rhizomorphs Pathology detection This can be done by machines or by dogs smelling the trees, similar to the methods used to find truffles. It can also be done by monitoring and identification can happen via tree clinics, experts such as arborists or even non-experts through citizen science. It is important to consider the disease triangle when evaluating pathologies. Demonstration of suspected active agents can be done by confirmation of Koch's postulates.

They are cylindrical or square-shaped devices, and usually threaded. There are several varieties: the Harms cage, Ray cage, Pyramesh cage, InterFix cage, and lordotic LT cage, all of which are made from titanium; the Brantigan cage, made from carbon fibre; and the Cortical Bone Dowel, which is cut from allograft femur. The cages can be packed with autologous bone material in order to promote arthrodesis. Such implants are inserted when the space between the spinal discs is distracted, such that the implant, when threaded, is compressed like a screw. Unthreaded implants, such as the Harms and Pyramesh cages have teeth along both surfaces that bite into the end plates. Technology: expansion vs. static devices Expandable implant devices are at the forefront of technology in this field, with cages that expand in place for optimal end-plate-to-endplate fit and correction of lordosis.

The college was founded in 1868. With enrollment increasing every year, Concordia College prospered towards the end of the nineteenth century . History Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion de la Concordia was established by Do√±a Margarita Roxas de Ayala by converting her three-and-a-half hectare villa, the La Concordia Estate in Paco, Manila, into a school. She requested eight nuns from the Daughters of Charity from Spain to come to the Philippines to administer the school. They arrived on May 3, 1868 and operated the free school or 'Escuela Pia'. Sixty students enrolled and were taught religion, good manners, reading and writing, simple arithmetic, culture, and arts like sewing, embroidery, cooking, needlecraft and household work.

The first season was the most popular new show in any genre in the 2009‚Äì10 television season with an average audience of 17.7 million viewers. Originally, the show was created in response to corporate distrust, as echoed in the introduction of the first two seasons. On March 9, 2010, CBS announced it had commissioned Undercover Boss for a second season. On July 28, 2010, CBS announced four company executives had signed up for the second season, from NASCAR, DirecTV, Chiquita Brands International, and Great Wolf Lodge, Inc.

OWN has also broadcast repeats of Undercover Boss since the fall of 2011. =Format= Each episode features a high-positioned executive or the owner of a corporation going undercover as an entry-level employee in his or her own company. The executive changes appearance and assumes an alias and fictional back-story. The fictitious explanation for the accompanying camera crew is that the executive is being filmed as part of a documentary about entry-level workers in a particular industry. They spend approximately one week undercover, working in various areas of the company's operations, with a different job and in most cases a different location each day. The boss is exposed to a series of predicaments with amusing results and invariably spends time getting to know selected company employees, learning about their professional and personal challenges. At the end of the undercover week, the boss returns to his or her true identity and calls in the selected employees to the corporate headquarters. The boss rewards hardworking employees through campaign, promotion, material, or financial rewards. Other employees are given training or better working conditions. The show's producers determine what companies will be featured, what jobs the bosses will do, and which employees and which situations will be shown. The company has no control over what airs, although a promise is made the companies' reputations will not be hurt.York, Emily Bryson and Bush, Michael, \\"What It Takes to Be an 'Undercover Boss'\\", Advertising Age.

As of July 3, 2020, the first seven seasons are available on Hulu. =Reviews= Undercover Boss received mixed reviews; most held good words for the opening episode, but some criticized elements of the show's format. The New York Daily News praised the concept as \\"simple and brilliant\\" and \\"an hour of feel-good television for underappreciated workers.\\" Reviewers with the Chicago Sun-Times and the New York Times complimented the opening episode, although the latter described the ending as \\"embarrassingly feudal\\" and had reservations on Waste Management, Inc COO Lawrence O'Donnell III's plan to create a task force to address the problems he found: \\"Larry's plans to reform his company and humanize the workplace seem great, until he starts to order up committees to study what he has learned. So many good intentions have gone to die in task forces, off-site meetings and mentoring programs.\\" \\"The show is a welcome change from reality concepts based on humiliating people,\\" concluded the Wall Street Journal. \\"It is emotionally stirring, with catharsis and messages of virtue rewarded and lessons learned for the betterment of all,\\" said the Baltimore Sun. The Washington Post, in a negative review, said that Undercover Boss \\"is a hollow catharsis for a nation already strung out on the futility of resenting those who occupy CEO suites.\\" Entertainment Weekly initially panned it, calling the first episode a \\"CBS- organized publicity stunt\\" and \\"a recruiting tool for a worker uprising,\\" but in another review described the show as \\"irresistible.\\" The Los Angeles Times believed that it was deriving its idea from Fox's Secret Millionaire (also created by Stephen LambertEureka!: The Secret Millionaire (RDF for C4)  In- depth  Broadcast) and that it was 'cooked' for TV, with the low-level workers being hand-picked, but conceded that the show is \\"undeniably touching\\". Arianna Huffington noted, \\"In the 19th century, one of the most effective ways to convey the quiet desperation of the working class to a wide audience was via a realistic novel. In 2010, it's through reality TV. And Undercover Boss has clearly touched a nerve with viewers. Last week [February 28 ‚Äì March 6, 2010], only the Olympics and American Idol scored higher in the ratings.\\" In a season-end review, the New York Timess chief television critic, Alessandra Stanley, examined the unexpected success of the show and concluded that \\"it's the humility of the workers, their genuine astonishment and thankfulness over small acts of benevolence, that is most striking. If nothing else, Undercover Boss is a reminder that in bad times, people are less eager to confront or provoke authority; mostly they wish for small favors and the big, serendipitous strokes of luck.\\" On the 10th Anniversary of the show Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club was severely critical of the show: \\"Undercover Boss is some of the most blatant propaganda on American television. It's a shameless endorsement of capitalist inequality that may as well end each episode by reminding everyday Americans that they should shut up and be grateful their lives are controlled by such selfless exemplars of virtue. It's class warfare in everything but name.\\" References External links * * Production Website * * Category:2010 American television series debuts Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2020s American reality television series Category:American television series based on British television series Category:CBS original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program winners Category:Super Bowl lead-out shows Undercover Boss United States ko:Ïñ∏ÎçîÏª§Î≤Ñ Î≥¥Ïä§ ","title":"Undercover Boss (American TV series)"},{"id":"28295116","text":"Hypsoma (Babylonian nisirti a≈°ar or bit nisirti; \\"hidden place\\"; pl. hypsomata) is a Greek word indicating the Ecliptic high point of a celestial body, as seen from Earth (geocentric perspective).

History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his first year in Leipzig, which he had started after Trinity of 1723, for the Eleventh Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, on the gospel of Christ and Paul's duty as an apostle (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector (). The unknown poet stayed close to the gospel and alluded to several Bible passages. The cantata is opened by a line from . the closing chorale is the first stanza of Christoph Tietze's hymn \\"Ich armer Mensch, ich armer S√ºnder\\" (1663). Bach first performed the cantata on 8 August 1723. Alfred D√ºrr assumes that Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut, BWV 199, composed for the same occasion in Weimar, was also performed in the service.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for soprano, tenor and bass soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes da caccia, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (soprano): # Chorale:  Music  In the opening chorus the instruments go with the voices as in a motet. The words are set in a strict counter-fugue: each entrance is followed by an entrance in inversion. The sequence is concluded by a canonic imitation on a new theme: in the words \\"\\" (and do not serve God with a false heart) the falseness is expressed by chromatic. A second expanded fugue presents even more complex counterpoint than the first. A secco recitative prepares the aria with an accompaniment of the two oboe da caccia and violin I in syncopation, which even the tenor voice picks up in the first part. It is not a da capo aria, as only the ritornello repeats the beginning. The final words of the second recitative end like an arioso to stress \\"\\" (so that you can find mercy and aid). The soprano aria expresses like a prayer \\"\\" (Beloved God, have mercy). The two oboes da caccia illustrate a movement of supplication even together with the soprano voice. The final chorale is sung on the melody of \\"\\"Wer nur den lieben Gott l√§√üt walten\\", which Bach used also in his choral cantata BWV 93.

It has glossy green, variably-shaped leaves and clusters of white-lemon flowers in spring. Description Leionema elatius is a shrub that grows to high with either smooth stems or with star-shaped hairs. The leaves are flat, lance- shaped, oblong or narrowly oval to spoon-shaped, long, wide, upper surface shiny and smooth with a distinctive midrib below. The inflorescences are at the end of branches crowded by the leaves, pedicels and peduncles both slim. The calyx lobes are wide-triangular shaped and fleshy. The flower petals are white to light yellow, long and glandular. The fruit are about long and furrowed. Flowering occurs in spring. Taxonomy and naming Tall phebalium was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller, who gave it the name Eriostemon elatior in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected near Tenterfield. In 1998, Paul G. Wilson changed the name to Leionema elatius and the change was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (elatius) is derived from the Latin meaning \\"taller\\". Wilson described two subspecies and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: *L. elatius subsp. beckleri is a shrub to about high, stems rough and glandular, with more or less lance shaped leaves, long, wide, apex blunt or rounded or occasionally slightly notched and the fruit slightly flattened. This subspecies has a restricted distribution in the McPherson Range Queensland and north east New South Wales. *L. elatius subsp. elatius is a shrub to high, leaves more or less lance to egg-shaped, long, wide, rounded apex slightly notched, mostly smooth stems, flower bud oval-shaped about long, fruit wide and angled from the stem. This subspecies grows in the ranges in north eastern New South Wales, north of Bulahdelah. Distribution and habitat Leionema elatius grows mostly on the ranges north of Bulahdelah and far south-eastern areas of Queensland.

Early life Born on 26 October 1842 in Kellinghusen, (then part of Denmark), Alpen came to Australia in 1858 at the age of 16. Career After spending several years in Melbourne, Alpen was appointed director of the Vocal Philharmonic Society in the New South Wales town of Tumut in 1862, and from 1865 was based in Albury. He moved to Sydney in 1880 to work as a singing master for the newly established Department of Public Instruction (now the Department of Education), teaching at Fort Street and Hurlstone teacher training colleges. In 1884 he was appointed Superintendent of Music in the Department. He advocated enlightened modern methods of music teaching for school children, emphasising aural development and sight-singing, and in 1897 he published a treatise, Practical Hints for the Teaching of Vocal Music in Public Schools. In the earliest precursors of today's Schools Spectaculars, Alpen led massed student choirs in gala performances, often including his own compositions. His Commemoration Ode (1899) celebrated Fort Street School's Golden Jubilee. At the celebrations of the Inauguration of the Commonwealth in Centennial Park on 1 January 1901, he conducted an estimated 10,000 school children in a performance of his work Federated Australia. Alpen was also the organist at St Patrick's on Church Hill and St Benedict's on Broadway, both in Sydney. Among his later works, with words by Roderick Quinn, was Hail! Men of America, Hail!, which was performed as an \\"ode of welcome to the American Fleet\\" on its hugely popular first visit to Sydney Harbour in 1908.

Water pollution is an environmental issue on the West Coast of New Zealand. Water resources and water pollution come under the jurisdiction of the Resource Management Act and is controlled by the regional councils - for the West Coast it is the West Coast Regional Council. A 2008 State of the Environment report showed that: *acid mine drainage has significant effects on freshwater ecosystems *less than 5% of the water samples taken from contact recreation sites indicated unsafe swimming conditions. 17 sites are monitored along a length of 600 kmhttp://www.wcrc.govt.nz/about_us/our_region/ of coastline that drains hundreds of rivers. For the upper 150 km, north of Westport, there is no monitoringhttp://www.wcrc.govt.nz/state_of_the_environment/water_quality/contact_recreation_risk.htm *point source pollution has decreased and nonpoint source pollution has increased *Water deterioration occurs at the lower levels of a number of catchments *Water quality improvements were evident in a number of water quality indicators. Issues =Grey River= Raw sewage is discharged into the Grey River after heavy rainfall. Historically, sewage and stormwater from Greymouth, Cobden and Blaketown was discharged directly to the Grey River. Changes to the Grey District Council's wastewater schemes provide separation and treatment for sewage, except during periods of high rainfall, such as spring, when the capacity of the sewage treatment is exceeded. =Acid mine drainage= The West Coast has a long history of mining and some of the waterways suffer from acid mine drainage as a result of the leaching of acidic water from mining activity. =Drinking water= Eighty two percent of the population is supplied by reticulated drinking water with 28% having some form of treatment to improve water quality. None of the water supplies reach drinking water standards. =Lake Brunner= The water on Lake Brunner has been monitored since the 1990s and it shows that the water quality of the lake is declining. =Ngakawau River= North of Westport Water from the Stockton open cast coal mine pollutes the Ngakawau River. = Mokihinui River = 50 km north of Westport. This river has a 68,000ha catchment, which is largely pristinehttp://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Mokihinui_Forks_Ecological_Area and within the conservation estatehttps://www.doc.govt.nz/map/index.html upstream of the coastal region. There are two small settlements in the low reaches and two large farms, one at the river mouth, the other in Seddonville, behind the coastal range. The Seddonville farm is a large industrial dairy farm that in 2004 was still discharging all dairy effluent into the river. It took a concerted effort on the part of local environmentalists to get the regional council to insist on the farm installing effluent ponds. These ponds then largely discharged into the river via a drain for many years, and were washed out during floods until a particular complaint in 2016 got the regional council to insist on an upgrade, and a shift to above the floodline. A ditch connecting the dairy effluent pond to Coal Creek shows the upgraded and moved dairy effluent pond In September 2017 milk was discovered being discharged into the river via that same drain. Erroneous reporting in the local paper protected the farmer; it is not clear whether the erroneous reporting was the police, the regional council or reporterWestport News 2017.09.26 https://www.wpn.co.nz/. Evidence points to the dairy company refusing the milk due to unacceptable penicillin levels. There does not appear to be any contingencies provided on the West Coast for milk rejected by Westland Milk Products. It is unsafe to venture down McIndoes Rd, where the milking sheds and effluent ponds are, due to farmer aggression.milk being discharged from dairy shed into nearest creek There has also been extensive land use change over the last decade on this farm, where 60ha or more of forest remnants/ wetlands have been destroyed for humped and hollowed pasture. Agrichemicals and fertilizers are indiscriminately discharged onto pasture, creating non- point discharge into the river, where algal build-up during low flow often creates thick, opaque mats, although these have decreased from their worst around 2010. The river at the popular swimming hole in Seddonville is perhaps cleaner in summer 2019 than it has been in many years, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. The stones here are covered in slime from dairy effluent Discharge from dairy effluent ponds into Mokihinui estuary Discharge from dairy effluent ponds into Mokihinui estuary The farm at the river mouth discharges out of overflowing effluent ponds via a short stretch of creek into the lagoon. 30 years ago the stones of the lagoon sparkled in the sun, now they are coated year round in slime, and indigenous estuarine plants around the outlet are depauperate. The regional council is not interested in insisting the farmer clean up his effluent system or adhere to consent conditions for discharge of dairy effluent; if conditions were adhered to the lagoon would be clean once again. Condition 8 of the consent for dairy discharge at Mokihinui The farm also has its fencelines right on the edge of the sea, there is no buffer for coastal vegetation or penguin habitat. There are very few trees in paddocks and few riparian shade margins along streams on either farm.

It is located in south western Punjab, lying in close proximity with the Rajasthan State's Hanumangarh and Sri Ganganagar districts. Many farmers of the village own land in both Punjab and Rajasthan. The village, unlike its other counterparts of Punjab, including neighboring villages, has a very low population of Sikh community. This is one of the bases on which neighboring Haryana lays its claim on the region, repeatedly denied by the Punjab government. The land here is very productive and though the average holding size is small-except for a few landlords holding huge estates with an annual turnover of crores of rupees-people in general are prosperous. Public amenities Kular has a number of social amenities including a middle school by Punjab government, 3 private schools, a primary health center, a veterinary care center and a grain market. A community centre for the scheduled caste members has also been constructed. Agriculture Kular has a prosperous agriculture with an elaborate irrigation structure, good water supply and good connectivity with the neighboring ago-markets. The soil is good enough to support 3 crops a year, which typically are- wheat and mustard in Rabi season, Cotton in Kharif season and another crop of maize or chickpea. Besides some vegetable farms are also there. Kular is a hub of Kinnow farming, specially taken up by large farmers. Social composition Kular is a Jatt caste dominated village, most of which are farmers by occupations. Among the Jatts, Sheoran subcaste is the most prominent which amount to about 30% of the village population and about 70% of village resources. Other Jat castes include, Kasaniya, Beniwal, Saharan, Godara, Jyani, Nyol, Nain etc. Among the non-Jat section there are almost all the castes available like the Scheduled Castes, Barbers, Brahmins, Carpenters, Tailors etc. Some of the nomadic blacksmith families have also settled in the village. Village morphology The village is a traditional Punjab village, with narrow lanes, closely clustered housing and small dwelling size. This is in stark contrast with the neighboring villages of Rajasthan where there is a central temple of Lord Hanuman with upper caste and landlords' houses surrounding it and lanes radiating in all directions. One of the street facing the gates of the temple is the main commercial street with most of the village shops located on it. On the far end of the street, there is a primitive central business district located with shops surrounding a Banyan tree and many roads radiating from it further away to the periphery. On the outer fringe, there are houses and worshipping centres of the scheduled castes members of the village. Important people Ch.

He is the first Muslim to be elected to federal parliament. Early life and education Husic was born in Sydney, to Bosnian Muslim immigrant parents Hasib and Hasiba, who settled in Australia in the late 1960s. His father, a welder, worked on iconic projects inaugurated by the Chifley government such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Husic says that while growing up, his household practiced Islam but also celebrated Christmas and Easter. As a child Husic didn't go to the mosque, but later in life took a deeper interest in Islam. After 9/11, Husic described himself as \\"non-practicing\\" Muslim, in order to \\"make people feel more comfortable.\\" He later regretted calling himself non-practicing. Husic was raised in Western Sydney and was educated at Blacktown South Public School, Mitchell High School and the University of Western Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Applied Communications. Early career and union involvement In the 1990s, Husic worked as a research officer for the member for Chifley, Roger Price. Husic was first elected as a branch organiser in 1997. In 1998, he was elected as vice-president of the Communications Division of the CEPU. From 1999 to 2003, he worked for Integral Energy as a communications manager. In July 2006, he became the secretary of the Communications Division of the CEPU. He was the national president of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia (CEPU) and the divisional secretary of the CEPU (Communications Division) before being elected to federal parliament. Political career Husic unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Greenway at the 2004 federal election, representing the Labor Party. Husic lost to Liberal candidate Louise Markus. During the election, anonymous campaigners distributed leaflets attacking Ed Husic for being a Muslim. There were also reports that voters were urged to vote for Louise Markus \\"because she's a Christian\\". The Labor Party accused the Liberal Party of orchestrating the leaflets, but the Liberal party denied that. Following the decision by Roger Price not to run for re-election, Husic contested and won the safe Labor seat of Chifley in 2010. When Kevin Rudd announced the Second Rudd Ministry in 2013, Husic became the first Muslim sworn onto the Australian federal government frontbench, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Broadband, taking his oath on the Quran.

The Meander Creek Reservoir is owned by the Mahoning Valley Sanitary District MVSD and is the largest provider of clean and safe drinking water of Mahoning and Trumbull County Ohio. In 1920, a petitioning effort began in the Mahoning Valley, an area consisting of cities such as Youngstown and Niles, Ohio for the formation of Water district. It was hoped that all the Mahoning Valley communities would unite, but there were too many obstacles. It settled on Youngstown and Niles as the two members of the future Water District in 1925. The district bought its first piece of land in 1927 from Josiah Kirkpatrick, who changed his name to Kirk. Kirk Road in Austintown, Ohio was named after him. Although, many water sources had been considered, including Lake Erie, it was decided to build a Mineral Ridge (Weathersfield Township),Ohio Dam on Meander Creek to create the reservoir with a purification plant. The total cost was nearly $9.2 million. Construction was started in 1929 and continued through 1932 when the MVSD opened for business. In 1944, McDonald village was added as the third member. The Auditor of State of Ohio has issued their Profile of the District in a recent Audit report, 2017. The Mahoning Valley Sanitary District (‚Äúthe District‚Äù) was formed in 1926 and began supplying water in 1932. The District provides quality water to the member cities ‚Äì the City of Youngstown and the City of Niles; and by special contract to the Village of McDonald. The members serve surrounding areas such as Girard, Canfield, Mineral Ridge, Lordstown and portions of 10 other townships. The District is a political subdivision of the State of Ohio established under the authority of the Sanitary Act of Ohio and governed by the Ohio Revised Code Chapter 6115. A Court of Jurisdiction that includes the Trumbull and Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas and a Board of Directors that is appointed by the member cities oversees the District. The District's Board of Directors consists of four members, two from the City of Youngstown and two from the City of Niles. The Sanitary District Act empowers the District to provide water supply, treatment, transmission feeder systems and storage reservoirs, but not distribution. The District utilizes a five- year forecast as the original document from which to form succeeding year's operating and debt budget. After updating the forecast for changes in revenue and expense assumptions, department heads will operate from the established budget which is prepared and approved by the Board of Directors prior to July 1 of each fiscal year. The line item budgets are reviewed periodically to ensure management becomes aware of any significant changes during the fiscal year. Local Economy: The District's water supply comes from the Meander Creek Reservoir. The Reservoir is seven miles long, covers 2,010 acres with 40 miles of shoreline, and has a capacity of 11 billion gallons. District owned land includes 5,500 acres enclosed by 35 miles of fence. The land is reforested with 4 million evergreens and serves as an unofficial fish and game refuge ‚Äì with no public access permitted! The District's current capacity is 60 million gallons per day and for recent years the average pumping per day over a fiscal year has been 21.5 million gallons per day. The District's water supply is treated using state of the art settling technology and equipment to deliver, pure, safe, clear, sparkling, soft, potable water to its member cities Youngstown, Niles and the Village of McDonald. These member cities will distribute treated water to many surrounding towns, cities, and villages in the Mahoning Valley which total approximately 225,000 end users. The Board's overall hiring policy is to maintain proper staffing levels so that maintenance and service is maintained throughout operations. In the prior fiscal year, the Board rehired a former professional engineer to temporarily reassume the position of the District's Chief Engineer. In January 2017, the Chief Engineer tendered his resignation. This left the Board in a difficult situation as this position also held an Ohio EPA Class IV water supply license which is an essential requirement for this facility. The Board utilized existing provisions in the law to bring on board the firm MS Consultants, Inc., to fill the position of Chief Engineer until such time that the Board could find an individual to fill this position. The Board began its search for a qualified individual utilizing a firm that specializes in finding people who hold the credentials required for the position of Chief Engineer. At the present time the Board is interviewing prospective candidates for this important position. Additionally in this fiscal year the position of Plant Operations Manager was abolished as the need for this position was determined by the Board as non-essential. The District's hourly employees are represented by AFSCME Local 1649. The Union and the Board of Directors came to agreement on the CBA in August 2016 and this agreement will be in place through June 30, 2019. The District has implemented a plant wide Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system will automate some functions of the water purification process that are currently performed manually by District employees. After fiscal year end 2016, the District's management put additional effort into completing that part of SCADA that was envisioned to have remote control of certain pumping processes. The Board had made the decision to abolish certain job positions that have been directly affected by the implementation of the SCADA system and did so in January 2017. The Board then created four new positions called Utility/Operators that do a similar job that was required previously but will have additional job duties and requirements that the abolished positions were not required to do. Discussions were held with Union officials and those employees directly affected by the positions that were abolished. These employees were then offered those positions or another position to remain employed at the District. All the affected employees chose the positions offered by the Board. These new positions are working well in the operation of our plant. The Board annually advertises for bids on chemicals that are needed in the purification process. The District will continue to have concerns with costs for the purification process as the high cost for energy drives the overall cost for chemicals. The unpredictability of prices for chemicals as well as our other variable costs such as electricity, natural gas heat and sludge removal will continue to remain an area of concern for District management. As is the case in most years some chemical costs come in higher than the year before with some coming in a little lower. Overall though, the cost of chemicals to treat water has increased in the fiscal year 2017 but was affected by the addition of certain chemicals to address raw water conditions not usually seen at our facility as well as adding a chemical that improves safety in the distribution system of the District to its member cities, which also adds benefit to each City's own distribution system. As mentioned in previous reports, oil and gas exploration (fracking) in our area may have contributed to our ability to enter into variable contracts to provide gas and electricity. The last several fiscal years have provided us with substantial savings to budget on these variable expenses. It remains to be seen whether or not this market will affect this part of our operation in the future. The MVSD is now, though, enjoying the positive aspects of market forces in this industry. Budgeting for energy costs will continue to present management with a more complex set of factors to determine energy costs for producing potable water. The constantly changing conditions of the Meander Reservoir have always contributed to some uncertainty regarding the needs of treatment. The types and volume of chemicals needed to produce potable water each and every year requires much analysis and a good bit of luck, and as mentioned previously in this report the District had to implement changes to its treatment process as was necessary because of raw water conditions. The Ohio Revised Code section 6115.01 through 6115.79 provides the orderly mechanism for the District to establish and receive the revenue stream that will provide for daily operating needs and maintaining the facility's buildings and process equipment through capital improvements. The Board and management review and update the five-year operating and capital improvement forecast to determine the revenue stream necessary to maintain operations and capital improvement projects deemed essential to maintain our plant going forward in the near future and beyond. The implementation and ongoing use and modification of our five year financial model has been the essential tool to provide non-biased legitimate and useful information to all stakeholders and receive a most important positive feedback and acceptance from those decision makers. The Mahoning Valley population in the service area which the District has provided potable water for 85 years has become significantly smaller. The belief of all stakeholders that the District water plant be maintained at a level of excellence in all areas of production and management will provide serious and meaningful deliberations in all years going forward. The reservoir's south end continues as a little river going southward. The reservoir is managed by the Mahoning Valley Sanitary District. Hunting, boating and fishing are prohibited. Most of the reservoir is located in Austintown Township in Mahoning County or in Weathersfield Township in Trumbull County. Reference: The dam creating the reservoir, Mineral Ridge Dam, is an earthen dam built in 1932. It is 60 feet high, 3480 feet long at its crest, impounds a maximum capacity of 62,000 acre-feet, and is owned and operated by the Mahoning Valley Sanitary District.http://findlakes.com/meander_creek_reservoir_ohio_vacation.htm References External links * The Mahoning Valley Sanitary District Category:Bodies of water of Mahoning County, Ohio Category:Bodies of water of Trumbull County, Ohio Category:Reservoirs in Ohio Category:Dams in Ohio Category:United States local public utility dams Category:Earth-filled dams ","title":"Meander Creek Reservoir"},{"id":"28295974","text":"Integrity Management Plan (part of an asset integrity management system) is a documented and systematic approach to ensure the long-term integrity of an asset or assets.

He is best known for his conservative and free market views and passion for the constitutional and founding principles of the United States of America.  Early life and education  Crespo was born in Los Angeles, California to Luis and Elsa Crespo, Cuban exiles who fled Cuba in the early 1960s. Crespo attended Catholic grammar school, Don Bosco Tech(Rosemead, CA) and later went on to graduate from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C., with a bachelor's degree in international politics. He also has a master's degree in war studies from King's College London and a master's degree in international relations from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom.  Military career  Crespo served as an artillery and intelligence officer in the U.S. Marine Corps for 12 years, on both active duty and in the Reserves, receiving an honorable discharge (honorary retirement) as a captain in 1998. He served in numerous countries on four continents in artillery, infantry and airborne units, and spent six months aboard a helicopter assault ship in the Far East as part of a Marine Expeditionary Unit‚ÄîSpecial Operations Capable (MEU-SOC). Assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he was posted in a diplomatic capacity (military attach√©) at several U.S. embassies in the Balkans, Middle East and Latin America. There Captain Crespo served as Acting U.S. Naval Attach√© in Croatia, U.S. Defense Attach√© Liaison in Qatar, and Assistant U.S. Naval Attach√© in Venezuela. During his service he earned numerous awards and distinctions including a DIA Joint Service Achievement Medal (JSAM), a DIA Joint Service Commendation Medal (JCOM), and various letters of commendation. Crespo later returned to the Pentagon as a consultant, working between 2007 and 2009 as a senior manager developing, launching and managing a major media project for the U.S. Southern Command in Miami, Florida.  Conservative media personality  Paul Crespo speaking on radio Paul Crespo has authored a regular column on politics, military affairs and diplomacy for The Miami Herald, and served on that paper's editorial board as the sole conservative voice. Additionally, he has written extensively for other venues such as Newsmax Magazine, American Legion Magazine and The Washington Times. He also co-hosted a daily, Spanish-language political talk show for Univision Radio where he was the conservative counterpoint to his liberal co-host. Crespo has appeared nationally and internationally on CNN, Fox News, Sky News, Telemundo and Univision, as well as on numerous local TV network outlets as an expert on U.S. politics, national security and international affairs. In 2003, he was the on-air military analyst for the local WSVN 7 TV news (Fox affiliate) in Miami during the Iraq War. In 2003, Crespo received a Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship from the Phillips Foundation.  Community involvement  Crespo speaks at the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute's (CHLI) \\"Future leaders Conference\\" in 2008 Crespo was a lecturer in the political science department at the University of Miami where he taught U.S. politics with a focus on the U.S. Constitution and American founding principles. He was also an election expert at the University of Miami. Crespo is founder and president of Civica Americana (Hispanic-American Civics Foundation), a non-profit organization that \\"promotes American values, heritage, citizenship and constitutional and free-market principles in the Hispanic community as well as in Latin America.\\" Between 2005 and 2007, he served on the Board of Directors, and was the project director for, the new Bay of Pigs Museum project, helping to launch an effort to build a new Bay of Pigs Museum to honor those who fought to try to liberate Cuba from communism.  Professional experience  Crespo works as a senior advisor at Raptor Strategies, a boutique public relations and public affairs firm based in Washington, D.C. and as a senior consultant, Alhambra Investment Partners, money management and investment firm based in Coral Gables, Florida. After his retirement from the U.S. Marine Corps, Crespo worked as International Security Consultant and Kidnap and Ransom negotiator with Ackerman Group in Miami and as an investment advisor/broker with Lehman Brothers in New York City, New York.  Republican Party activist  Crespo has been active with various Republican Party political campaigns in South Florida and elsewhere. During the 2000 George W. Bush presidential campaign, he founded and co-chaired the South Florida Young Professionals for Bush (YP4W) and later was part of the Bush/GOP Florida Recount Team, where among other things he ensured the absentee military vote was properly counted. In 2004, Crespo was the South Florida Media Coordinator for the George W. Bush re-election campaign, serving as one of the Bush campaign's primary on-air media surrogates in both Spanish and English languages.  Political campaigns  Crespo ran twice unsuccessfully for public office first in 2010 for U.S. Congress in Florida's District 25 and later in 2012 for Florida House of Representatives in District 105. Crespo's campaign themes highlighted his service as a U.S. Marine Corps officer and his role as the outsider in this race running against a career, machine politician. He stated his belief in the concept of \\"citizen legislators\\" and while running for U.S. Congress pledged to term limit himself to eight years and to not accept nor participate in the generous Congressional pension plan, stating, \\"If your 401k retirement account tanks because of a bad economy your Congressman should be in the same boat.\\" These experiences involved Crespo in controversies that established him as the anti-corruption candidate and as an activist against absentee ballot abuse in Florida. While running for U.S. Congress, Crespo called on the resignation of then Miami-Dade County Republican Party Chairman and now disgraced former Congressman David Rivera for abusing his Party chairmanship, conflicts of interest and questionable fundraising methods (which later developed into ethics complaints and criminal investigations). For his effort, Crespo was involved in a notorious episode of political intimidation caught on video as Miami-Dade County Republican Executive Director order off-duty police to remove Crespo from the podium and eventually out of the meeting altogether. Complaints by Crespo's campaign were filed a complaint with the City of West Miami Police Department and to the U.S. Attorney's office for possible federal civil rights violations and harassment by Rivera's staff against a candidate for federal office. In 2010, Crespo made controversial remarks in an op-ed titled \\"Absentee vote fraud destroying Miami-Dade elections\\". Crespo alleged there were voting irregularities and a conspiracy to steal hundreds of votes in the City of Sweetwater that went to his political opponent through the abuse of absentee ballots. This event transformed Crespo into an electoral reform advocate, who later joined the Florida Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C.  Affiliations  Prior to his run for U.S. Congress, Paul Crespo was an adjunct fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He is a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) (UK); and the Council on Emerging National Security Affairs (CENSA) in Washington, D.C. Crespo is a member of the National Press Club, as well as other organizations such as the Oxford and Cambridge Club, the Army and Navy Club, the Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired (DACOR) organization. Crespo is a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C (Florida State Advisory Committee).

He was arrested on 7 April 2010 by the self-proclaimed forces in Tiraspol charged of high treason in favor of the Republic of Moldova. Biography Ernest Vardanean was born in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia; his family moved to Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic after the 1988 Armenian earthquake. Vardanean graduated from the Faculty of Political Science of the Moldova State University; he speaks five languages. He ran in the 2005 election for Parliament of Transnistria, but his campaign failed. He is one of the founders of the Pridnestrovian Armenians Union and is a member of the organisation's board. Vardanean worked for the Russian Internet news agency Novy Region in Tiraspol. In 2009, he also started to work for the Chi≈üinƒÉu-based newspaper Puls, which caused irritation among Transdniestrian authorities. He was known in Moldova for his often critical reporting on state officials and matters of public interest.SEEMO / IPI Press Release: Journalist Arrested, Charged with Treachery in Moldova In 2009, Vardanean was selected for a position in the United Nations Secretariat.Journalist confesses to espionage amid fears he was coerced Vardanean is married to Irina Vardanean (maiden name - LazƒÉr), who comes from the Moldovan town of Rezina. They have a son, Arutiun, born in 2003, and a daughter, Carina, born in 2009. The family lives in Chi»ôinƒÉu, where Vardanean is a lecturer at the Moldova State University. Reactions to arrest On April 7, a group of armed agents from PMR's Ministry of State Security arrested Vardanean in front of his home in Tiraspol and has been accused of working for the Moldovan intelligence in Chi≈üinƒÉu. On May 11, he was shown on Transdniestrian state television confessing to being a spy. Vardanean said he was recruited by Nicolae Botezatu, an official with the Moldovan Intelligence and Security Service, in May 2001 when he was a fourth-year student at Chi≈üinƒÉu University. Vardanean's lawyer said his client was forced to confess to something he did not do (he believes the journalist was forced to make the confession in exchange for a meeting with his wife Irina). His family and friends also believe he was forced to confess under pressure.Jailed Moldovan Journalist's Wife Told Husband Healthy, Detention To Continue On April 21, 2010, the European Union Heads of Mission in Chi≈üinƒÉu expressed their deep concern that the journalist Ernest Vardanean, who was arrested by the Transnistrian security forces, had been denied basic human rights.Delegation of the European Union to Moldova, EU Heads of Mission Statement on the case of journalist Ernest Vardanyan Oliver Vujoviƒá, the Secretary General of the South East Europe Media Organisation, said: \\"The accusations against Vardanian of high treason due to critical reporting are unacceptable...

The technical aspects of AIMS are illustrated in Figure 1. Originally developed in the UK, Asset Integrity Management was the result of a collaboration between the HSE and leading oil and gas operators resulting in a series of reports (Belfry Report) and workshops, the outcome being a group of documents called Key Programmes (KP Series), currently publicly available. An Integrity Management System should address the quality at every stage of the asset life cycle, from the design of new facilities to maintenance management to decommissioning. Inspections, auditing/assurance and overall quality processes are just some of the tools designed to make an integrity management system effective. Under the operational phase of the life cycle, the asset integrity, for example in the oil and gas industry can be divided into disciplines based on equipment categories: *1) Static equipment integrity *2) Rotating equipment/machinery integrity *3) Electrical equipment integrity *4) Instrument and control equipment integrity *5) Structural integrity *6) Pipeline integrity *7) Well integrity *8) Evacuation and rescue system integrity The AIMS should also endeavour to maintain the asset in a fit-for- service condition while extending its remaining life in the most reliable, safe, and cost-effective manner. The AIM programs (in the US) attempt to meet API-580, API-581, and PAS 55 requirements, as applicable. (However local legal requirements may differ, please refer to a competent, experienced local professional for advice). The AIMS document will stipulate the requirements for subsequent Integrity Management Plans. Asset Integrity management improves plant reliability and safety whilst reducing unplanned maintenance and repair costs. https://www.intelligencebank.com But an asset integrity management system does not exist in isolation. In order to successfully implement an asset integrity management system in a dynamic operating environment, it is essential that all stakeholders have a consistent and a unified understanding of what the essentials of asset integrity are and how they can be applied in their day-to-day operations, yet this is often cited as among the most significant challenges in achieving an integrity culture within an organisation.

Born in Kiel when it was in the Danish Duchy of Holstein, he and his family were displaced when Marshall Davoust, Napoleon's \\"Iron Marshall,\\" occupied the family home as his headquarters. Allhusen was employed by Koch & Sons, grain merchants of Rostock and then moved to Newcastle, where he was employed by Campbell & Reveley, also grain merchants. Allhusen became a British citizen by a private Act of Parliament. He later went into partnership with Henry Bolckow and expanded into the ship and insurance brokerage business. In 1840, Allhusen purchased a soap works in Gateshead, and began the manufacture of chemicals, eventually calling the company C. Allhusen & Sons. In 1871, Allhusen converted his enterprise into a joint-stock company, Newcastle Chemical Works, Ltd. He made a large fortune, and was influential in the region as company director and shareholder in such companies as the Northumberland & Durham District Bank, the Newcastle & Gates Water Company and the Consett Iron Works. He was an active member of the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce and the Tyne Commission. In 1854, Allhusen was among local industrialists urging construction of a new quay for Gateshead. When the quay was eventually constructed, the local government failed to include necessary transportation facilities to allow efficient transport to and from the quay facility. As a result, the quay complex required years of subsidies and struggled to avoid failure as Allhusen had predicted. Allhusen died January 13, 1890 at Stoke Court, Buckinghamshire.

Formation Thionyl fluoride reacting with fluorine gas can produce thionyl tetrafluoride.Harry Julius Emel√©us and A.G. Sharpe Advances in Inorganic Chemistry Volume 2 Academic Press 1960 page 117 This was how the gas was first discovered by Moissan and Lebeau in 1902. They identified the formula by the pressure changes resulting from the reaction. Silver fluoride and platinum are capable of catalyzing the reaction. It can also be formed by heating sulfur hexafluoride with air to 400¬∞. This can happen when inhaling through a lit cigarette. Or the reaction of silver difluoride with thionyl fluoride at 200 degrees. Another way to form it is by electrolyzing hydrogen fluoride with a solution of sulfur dioxide, which also made oxygen difluoride and sulfuryl fluoride.Shunji Nagase Fluorination of Inorganic Sulfur Compounds Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan vol 42 page 2062 1968 Also thionyl chloride or thionyl fluoride electrolyzed with hydrogen fluoride produced even more of the gas. Reactions Thionyl tetrafluoride reacts with water to make hydrofluoric acid, sulfurofluoridic acid, and sulfuryl difluoride. Mercury can strip off fluoride to make thionyl fluoride and mercurous fluoride. Strong bases result in formation of fluoride and fluorosulfate ions. = Click chemistry = Thionyl tetrafluoride can be used in click chemistry through reactions with primary amines known as sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx). This kind of reaction was the first \\"click\\" reaction to generate a three- dimensional core.

Benner, who grew up in Kentucky and studied drama in California and England, landed in Toronto in the early 1970s. Writing for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he pitched an idea for a film about a gay hairdresser with dreams of New York City success to the Canadian Film Development Corporation (now Telefilm Canada). Approved, he was able to secure financing with the help of Toronto producers, and Outrageous!, the first film to feature Craig Russell, an openly gay cabaret performer, went on to critical success at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. Funny and sympathetic, Outrageous! is considered a landmark film in Canadian Queer cinema. Ten years later Benner talked Russell into doing a sequel (1987), which fared not nearly as well. Benner died from complications due to AIDS in 1990. In addition to his films, he directed several episodes of the Canadian television series 9B, Monsters, Street Legal and Road to Avonlea.

The facility is a 35' recreational vehicle with two full editing bays inside. It debuted in March 2006 at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas. Design philosophy The interior of the truck was designed to focus on the comfort of the passengers instead of focusing on the technology. Most of the tech is hidden out of view with only the displays, keyboards, and such being visible. The vehicle has two slide-out compartments that expand the interior to . The custom cabinetry and counters were created by Gerry Burgess. The counter tops and several of the cabinets feature rounded edges which were created by steaming and bending the wood over time. The floor is covered with laminate hardwood flooring. There's a video projector inside the RV that points to a dual-vision projection screen in front of a 16:9 aspect window in the side of the RV. At night the images projected onto the screen are visible to anybody standing outside the truck. This was designed to allow large groups of crew members to view footage without having to crowd into the truck. The technology used in Confidence Bay is customized to the needs of the project. By default, the systems are multi-processor MacPro towers with Final Cut Studio, but the tech has been reconfigured in the past for AVID, Premiere, and Sony Vegas. The infrastructure is designed to work with any desktop platform. Power The power system on Confidence Bay is a double conversion power system. Alternating Current (AC) power is fed into a high power battery charger that feeds 12 V direct current (DC) into of deep cycle marine batteries. Two 2000 W ProSine inverters use the power from the battery bank and feed pristine 120 V AC power to the two editing systems. This configuration completely isolates the sensitive electronics onboard from any spikes, sags, blackouts, or otherwise irregular power fluctuations that frequently occur when plugging into some generators or less than ideal electricity sources. This also allows the systems to remain up and fully functional while completely disconnected from any power source at all for close to an hour at moderate electrical load. The truck does have a 5.5 kW gasoline generator which can run continuously for over 3 days if grid power is not available. The fuel supply is the 75 gallon gas tank used by the RV's engine. The generator will shut off when the gas gets down to 1/8 of a tank to prevent running the tank dry.

RETScreen Expert was highlighted at the 2016 Clean Energy Ministerial held in San Francisco. The Government of Canada's Treasury Board Secretariat uses RETScreen Expert as its greenhouse gas reporting tool for all federal departments and agencies required to report emissions. RETScreen Expert is the current version of the software and was released to the public on September 19, 2016. The software allows for the comprehensive identification, assessment and optimization of the technical and financial viability of potential renewable energy, energy efficiency and cogeneration projects; the measurement and verification of the actual performance of facilities; the identification of energy savings/production opportunities; and portfolio management of multiple facilities. \\"Viewer mode\\" in RETScreen Expert is free and permits access to most of the functionality of the software. Unlike past versions of RETScreen, however, a new \\"Professional mode\\" (which allows users to save and print, as well as to access premium features) is now available on an annual subscription basis. RETScreen Suite, comprising RETScreen 4 and RETScreen Plus, is the previous version of the RETScreen software. RETScreen Suite includes off-grid analysis capabilities. Unlike RETScreen Suite, RETScreen Expert is one integrated software platform; utilizes detailed and comprehensive archetypes for assessing projects; and includes portfolio analysis capability. RETScreen Expert integrates a number of databases to assist the user, including a global database of climatic conditions obtained from 6,700 ground-based stations and NASA satellite data; benchmark database; cost database; project database; hydrology database and product database. The software contains extensive integrated training material, including an electronic textbook. History The first version of RETScreen was released on April 30, 1998. RETScreen Version 4 was launched on December 11, 2007 at Bali, Indonesia by Canada's Minister of the Environment. RETScreen Plus was released in 2011.

Hewitt arrived at North Melbourne from WAFL club Subiaco, having been recruited with the 23rd selection of the 1996 AFL Draft. He was unable to hold down a key forward spot at North Melbourne as Wayne Carey and Corey McKernan were first choices. Hewitt, who spent some time in the ruck, did however manage to put together 19 games in 1998 and win an AFL Rising Star nomination. The following season he could only manage four games due to the strength of the Kangaroos team, which went on to claim their second premiership in four seasons. The Kangaroos traded Hewitt to Adelaide in the 2000 AFL Draft, for pick 23 Drew Petrie. He appeared in an elimination final with Adelaide in 2001 but after playing just two games in 2002 he was delisted. Returning to Western Australia, Hewitt signed with South Fremantle in 2003 and had a four-year stint in the WAFL. He topped the club's goal-kicking in his last two seasons, with 53 goals in their premiership year of 2005 and 61 goals in 2006.

He is best known for his translation of important works of Italian literature, notably the works of Dante's Divine Comedy. Biography He was born in Mapperley Hall in 1795, the first child of Ichabod Wright (1767‚Äì1862) and Harriet Maria Day (d.1843) and the eldest of their three sons and ten daughters.Ichabod Charles Wright, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The grandfather of Ichabod Snr., another Ichabod Wright (1700‚Äì1777), was an ironmonger who founded a bank in Long Row, Nottinghamshire in 1761. Wright studied at Eton College (1808‚Äì14) and pursued further education in Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with second-class BA honours in 1817 and MA in 1820, holding an open fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, from 1819 to 1825. In 1825, he joined his father in the banking profession and shortly after he began working he married Theodosia (1806‚Äì1895) on 21 December 1825, the daughter of Thomas Denman, the first Lord Denman, who later became Lord Chief Justice of England. Wright indulged in much scholarly study alongside his profession and in the 1830s developed a passion for Italian literature and a thirst for the language. He translated the works of Dante, notably Divina commedia in three instalments, Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, which earned him critical acclaim. These were published by Messrs. Longmans in 1833, 1836, and 1840 respectively and reprinted in a second edition in 1845. They were dedicated respectively to Lord Brougham, Archbishop Howley, and his father-in-law Lord Denman who also shared an interest in Italian literature. He proceeded to publish works related to his profession and in 1841 he published Thoughts on Currency, and in 1847, Evils of the Currency. In 1855 he published The War and our Resources, and in 1865 he published a translation of the Iliad of Homer in blank verse, translated between 1859 and 1864. In 1864 he wrote A letter to the Dean of Canterbury, on the Homeric lectures of Matthew Arnold; Matthew Arnold was a distinguished professor of poetry at the University of Oxford. His final work A Selection of Psalms in Verse was written in 1867, although many of his poems were printed privately after his death in 1873. Ichabod Charles Wright died on 14 October 1871 at Heathfield Hall, Burwash, Sussex. He had resided in Stapleford Hall but died in the home of his eldest son, Charles Ichabod Wright (born 1828), a politician and Conservative Party MP.

It was built by the Crowhurst, Sidley & Bexhill Railway under the patronage of the South Eastern Railway. The Chief Engineer to the project was Lt Col Arthur John Barry.Frederick Arthur Crisp Visitation of England and Wales, Volume 14, London (1906) Diverging from the Hastings Line at Crowhurst, an intermediate station at was served before the terminus was reached at . The line was closed under the Beeching Axe on 15 June 1964. History =Background= In the late nineteenth century, Bexhill had expanded rapidly. The town had been served by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway since the opening of on 27 June 1846. In 1896, a line was promoted by the Crowhurst, Sidley and Bexhill Railway, which was nominally independent. The scheme was supported by the South Eastern Railway, which entered into an operating arrangement with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway which came into effect on 1 January 1899, forming the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. The Crowhurst, Sidley & Bexhill Railway Company was incorporated in 1897, and permission was granted in that year for the line's construction. Lt Col Arthur John Barry was appointed as Chief Engineer to the project. The construction of the branch included a new station at (), on the Hastings Line, where a private siding had existed since about 1877; an intermediate station at () and the terminus at Bexhill-on-Sea (). Between Crowhurst and Sidley, a major viaduct was built to carry the line across a valley. The line was supported by the South Eastern Railway because it was hoped that passengers would use that line instead of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's routes to London, which were or longer, depending on whether one travelled via Plumpton or . Seven contractors' locomotives were used in the construction of the line, one of which was an 0-6-0ST named St Leonards. Over of earth was moved during the construction of the line. Initially, the line had some success, but following the electrification of the railway between and in 1935, traffic on the branch declined. =Description= The line diverged from the Hastings Line at a point south of Crowhurst and headed in a generally southerly direction. After crossing the Combe Haven Viaduct, the line swung to the south west. station was reached at . The line then continued in a south westerly direction, which became southerly on the approach to , from Crowhurst. The line was double track throughout. =Operation= The line was operated from the outset by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. The South Eastern Railway absorbed the Crowhurst, Sidley and Bexhill Railway Company in 1905. Under the SE&CR;, services were worked by the older classes of SER locomotives, which were stationed at Bexhill. These continued until 1936, when push-pull trains were introduced. Under British Railways, push-pull services were operated by H Class 0-4-4T locomotives. Through services between Bexhill and were worked by Schools Class 4-4-0 locomotives.; these were withdrawn at the beginning of the Second World War and never reinstated. Between 27 November 1949 and 5 June 1950, Bo Peep tunnel was closed to traffic and all services on the Hastings line were diverted to Bexhill West. A push-pull service operated between Crowhurst Junction and during the closure of the tunnel. When steam was eliminated from the Hastings Line, Diesel-Electric Multiple Units took over the services. This took place in June 1958; a new timetable was introduced at the same time, providing the line with an hourly service. During the latter years of steam on the Hastings Line, a service between and Bexhill West was operated for schoolchildren. It was continued during the early years of the Hastings Diesel units; these were six-car trains, but the service was not shown in public timetables. A daily freight train ran from Tonbridge to Bexhill West. In 1958 it was usually hauled by a Q class engine. =Closure= It is claimed that the timetables were altered to the detriment of those commuters who wished to use the line. Fares were also raised, adding a further disincentive. The line was closed as part of the Beeching Axe. The last day of public services was 14 June 1964. Some of the services on that day were operated by 6S DEMU ‚Ññ 1007, and 2H DEMU ‚Ññ 1120. The 6S was running reduced to four carriages at the time. Combe Haven Viaduct The largest structure on the line was the Combe Haven Viaduct (), which was also known as the Filsham, Sidley or Crowhurst Viaduct. It was long, and high, with seventeen arches. The viaduct took two years to build, due to the nature of the ground it was built on. Built at a cost of ¬£244,000, over 9,000,000 bricks were used in the construction of the viaduct. Concrete blocks were used for the foundations, each one measuring and deep. Following the closure of the line, it was proposed in late 1968 to demolish the viaduct. Local residents were opposed to the plan, and a question was asked in Parliament by Neill Cooper-Key regarding the preservation of the viaduct, which was not listed. Kenneth Robinson answered that British Railways were prepared to transfer ownership of the viaduct to any group willing to take it, but that maintenance costs were considerable. The viaduct was demolished in two stages, on 23 May and 12 June 1969. Stations =Crowhurst= was built to serve the branch. The station was provided with two through tracks and two tracks to serve the platforms. Each platform had a bay serving the branch. Crowhurst Junction was south of the station. =Sidley= Opening with the branch on 1 June 1902, station closed temporarily on 1 January 1917, not reopening until 14 June 1920. The entrance at Sidley Station for the south- bound platform to Bexhill West was down some steps which were situated to the side of the petrol station. The petrol station stands on the site of the original station entrance building which was demolished in 1971. The Crowhurst and London platform side had access from the road, and until the 1960s when the station closed there was also a small goods yard and coal merchant on the site. =Bexhill West= was originally named Bexhill. It closed temporarily on 1 January 1917, reopening on 5 November the same year. It was renamed three times: to Bexhill-on-Sea in 1920; on 9 July 1923 it became Bexhill (Eastern); finally becoming Bexhill West in November 1929. The station was provided with two pairs of platforms, two signal boxes, an extensive goods yard, and an engine shed. Only one of the two pairs of platforms saw regular use.

Since its development (see history below) Menthogen has been further developed in the UK by a team of trichologists. Menthogen's scalp cooling effect occurs due to the presence of menthol and alcohol within the formula. Other ingredients are claimed to counteract the effects of androgens said to contribute to both male and female pattern hair loss. History Menthogen was originally created and developed by Mr F.J. Cunningham MIT (Lond) MAE FRSPH at his dispensary in Castleton, Rochdale, Greater Manchester in 2002 for in clinic use with private clinic patient's within his trichology centre. A year long private double- blind study was undertaken to study the assumed benefits of the formulation. Science Menthogen contains vasodilators; stimulators which act upon blood capillaries and hair bulbs (roots) which have the effect of increasing the blood supply (and therefore nourishment) to the scalp and its hair's bulbs. Phytohormones are also present. These natural plant substances that, at low concentration, are claimed to influence hair growth and are present in many of the other 300 000 available hair loss solution products available in the northern hemisphere. Usage Menthogen is applied daily in the evening before retiring as this is claimed to allow improved penetration of the product; as the body relaxes during sleep so to does the dermis of the scalp. Side effects Menthogen can cause a slight 'tingling' of the scalp when applied due to the action of the vasodiliators. Users may also notice a slight pinkish reddening of the skin where the product is applied.

His mother was Sarah Wheeler, daughter of Jonas Wheeler, Bishop of Ossory and his wife Martha Tucker; Sarah was the widow of Mathew Tyrrell.Ball p.62 He graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 1666. Although he had originally intended to become a soldier, he resolved on a legal career instead, and entered Middle Temple in 1669. He seems to have been an exceptionally unruly student: he was fined for breaking down the doors and for gambling at Christmas.Ball p.62 He was called to the Irish Bar about 1672 and became Commissioner of Revenue Appeals in 1677. After the Revolution of 1688 he and his mother and children lived for a time in England.Ball p.62 He was appointed Prime Serjeant on 29 December 1692 and represented the borough of Galway in the Irish House of Commons from 1692 to 1693. In 1693 he was made Recorder of Dublin.Kenny p.153 Judge He was raised to the High Court bench as a Puisne Baron of the Irish Court of Exchequer in 1695,Ball p.63 and on 31 December 1696 was made one of the Commissioners of the Great Seal of Ireland, pending the appointment of John Methuen as Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1697.Ball p.63 He became Chief Baron of the Exchequer on 27 December 1703, holding the office until his death.Ball p.63 His elevation to the Bench was said to be part of an effort to remove judges who were suspected of Tory or pro-Catholic views; but it is surprising that Donnellan, who was a descendant of an Old Irish, Gaelic-speaking family which had several Roman Catholic members, was not suspected of Catholic sympathies himself.Ball p.22 As regards his political beliefs, Ball suggests rather cynically that he had found it expedient to change them, and that he was no more convinced a Whig than he had been a Tory.Ball p.22 In 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher John Dunton, on a visit to Dublin, gave a favourable verdict on the Irish judiciary, including Donnellan: \\"men whose reputation is such that no one complains of them\\". Family He married twice; little is known of his first wife, who died before 1688, leaving one surviving son, James, and a daughter.Ball p,62 He remarried Martha Ussher, daughter of Christopher Ussher, who outlived him by many years, and married secondly Phillip Perceval, brother of the 1st Earl of Egmont. Nehemiah and Martha had two sons, Nehemiah, MP for Tipperary, and Christopher, and two daughters, Katherine and Anne (died 1762). His daughter Anne is remembered today as the friend of the leading Irish writers of her time, and for founding the Donnellan Lectures at Trinity College Dublin.Ball p.63 Her sister Katherine married Robert Clayton, Bishop of Cork and Ross. The artist and letter writer Mary Delaney wrote an unflattering sketch of Katherine as \\"giving herself the airs of a Queen\\" after her husband was made a bishop. She may well have come to regret his promotion, as his religious opinions were so unorthodox as to raise doubts as to whether he was a Christian at all. Horace Walpole said unkindly that Clayton's writings seemed calculated to destroy anyone's Christian faith, and it seems that only his sudden death in 1758 averted an inquiry by his fellow bishops into charges of heresy against him.Walpole p.79 Portrait of Robert Clayton and his wife Katherine, daughter of Nehemiah Donnellan References * Ball, Francis Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 * Joseph Haydn and Horace Ockerby, The Book of Dignities, 3rd edition, London 1894 (reprinted Bath 1969) * Gerard, Frances Picturesque Dublin Old and New Hutchinson and Co London 1898 *Kenny, Colum Kings' Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 *Horace Walpole Memoirs and Portraits B.T.

Career Coming through the youth ranks of then top club Torino, Sclosa initially had difficulties getting regular match practice at the club. He therefore spent two years at smaller clubs Bologna and Como, before returning to Torino in 1984. Despite being a regular fixture in the clubs' second-place finishing season in 1984‚Äì85, Sclosa was sold to Bari a year later. Sclosa played one season at Bari, before moving to Pisa, where he scored almost half of his 17 professional football league goals. His strong form at Pisa impressed newcomers Lazio, who bought him to the club in the summer of 1988. Sclosa had his longest stay at a club in Lazio, playing for the club through six seasons. When the team was a midfield club, Sclosa was good enough to be a regular fixture in the starting line-up, but when the club bought stars such as Paul Gascoigne, Thomas Doll and Roberto Di Matteo, getting playtime was a tough task. Aged 33, Sclosa left Lazio in 1994, embarking on a switch to Cremonese, where he spent an injury-plagued season, with the club almost being relegated. Sclosa then moved on to Pistoiese in Serie B, where he played a final season before hanging up his boots aged 35. A few years after his retirement Sclosa became a licensated football agent.

The regiment was formed as dragoons in 1809, and was reorganized as uhlans in 1871. The regiment took part in Napoleon's Russian campaign, the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian war. In World War I it served as divisional cavalry for the 26th (1st W√ºrttemberg) Division. Formally disbanded on May 1, 1919, the regiment existed until September 1920 as Abwicklungsstelle. The 1st Squadron/18th Horse bore the regiment's tradition in the new Reichsheer. This particular regiment was also known as the \\"Queen's Guard\\", as the Queen was the \\"Colonel-In-Chief\\" of the regiment. Equipment Uhlan regiments were used in close attack or pursuit of an enemy. Lances adorned with banners and streamers were used when routing the enemy from the field. The troopers were also typically issued with a single action carbine rifle, a pistol and a dress sabre (which had the regiment, unit number and insignia engraved into the blade). On release from service, an officer was responsible for his own clothing for the trip home. If he had brought his own clothing in, he was expected to wear it out. Equipment and saddlery belonged to the army, but could be purchased. History As early as 1704, the Prussians were using cavalry troops armed with lances. In 1745, a unit known as \\"Bosniaken\\" was linked with the \\"Totenkopf-Husaren- Regiment\\" and wore a costume which derived from Bosnian and Polish national costume. By 1806, the Prussian Army still retained units with strong Polish and Bosnian links. These were the \\"Towarczys\\" Regiment and a self-standing \\"Towarczy\\" Battalion, both of which were armed primarily with the lance, and were used for scouting and foraging duties for which the Uhlans became justly famous. These troops were used in East Prussia and the bordering Polish and Austrian-Hungarian states and had a distinctly Tartar-Slav appearance. Saxony also had its Ulanen-pulks in the 18th. century, and in Bavaria a lancer regiment was raised in 1813, dressed in the ‚Äò√ñsterreichischer‚Äô style. The Prussian Uhlan regiment, raised in 1806/7 from the former ‚ÄòTowarczys\\", had a strength of eight squadrons but was later divided to form two separate regiments of four squadrons each. By 1819, the establishment of Uhlan Regiments had been increased to two Guard Regiments and eight line regiments distinguished by facing colours and different coloured buttons. The Garde- Regiments stemmed from the Leib-Ulanen-Eskadron, which was re-titled the Garde-Ulanen-Eskadron in 1810; a second Garde-Ulanen-Regiment was raised in 1819. The line regiments were raised from the Freiwillige and National cavalry regiments of 1813‚Äì1815 Freedom War, the Freikorps L√ºtzow, Freikorps Hellwig and the Russo-German Legion. In 1860, besides a 3rd Garde-Regiment, a further four line regiments were formed. In 1856, the third line regiment received the title Ulanen-Regiment K√∂nig Alexander II von Russland. In 1866, Regiments 13-16 were formed. In 1884, the \\"West Preussen Ulanen Regiment No. 1\\" was titled \\"Ulanen-Regiment Konig Alexander Ill von Russland (West Preussisches) No. 1\\". In 1889, Kaiser Wilhelm II was declared the Regimental Chief of the \\"1st Hannoverschen Ulanen-Regiment No. 13\\" which, on the same day, was re- titled \\"Konigs-Ulanen-Regiment (1 Hannoversches) No. 13\\". In 1902, the \\"Ulanen-Regiment Hennings von Treffenfeld (Altmarkisches) No. 16\\", was granted the distinction of wearing the cypher of King George of Saxony, and in the next year the \\"Th√ºringische-Ulanen-Regiment No. 6\\", was granted similar- distinction in respect of King Christian IX of Denmark. By 1871, the W√ºrttemberg cavalry had been re-organized as two Dragoon and two Uhlan Regiments. The Uhlans became the 19th and 20th Uhlan Regiments in the national numbered sequence. The Royal Armies of both Saxony and W√ºrttemberg retained their own War Ministries and Headquarters Staffs and Establishments and were bracketed in the 1st and 2nd Royal Saxon Army Corps (XII and XIX of the National Army) and the Royal W√ºrttemberg Army Corps (XIII of the National Army). These armies retained many characteristics of their old uniforms. The 1st and 2nd Saxon Uhlans, which were both raised in 1867, were given the numbers 17 and 18 in the national numbered sequence in 1871. A further Saxon Regiment was raised in 1905 and took the number 21. The Royal Bavarian Army remained completely autonomous under the command of its King and with its own Headquarters Staff and Establishments. It was formed into I, II and III Bavarian Army Corps and retained its old uniforms, but accepted some characteristics of the Prussian uniform and adapted these to their own needs. The 1st and 2nd Bavarian Uhlan Regiments were raised on 21 December 1863 - they did not figure in the numbered sequence of the national army.

Five passengers were killed; 35 were seriously injured, and 90 complained of shock or minor injuries Significant consequences of the accident were the adoption of improved vacuum braking systems on locomotives and passenger rolling stock, and the introduction of Automatic Train Control (ATC) in 1908. The trains The local train pulled by a 'four-coupled bogie passenger engine' (i.e. a 4-4-0 tender engine) Shows GWR to have had a number of 4-4-0 classes, but no other classes matching the descriptions in the BoT report. should have left London Paddington at 13:05. Due to the large crowds expected to travel to Windsor Racecourse it had been augmented by two extra coaches but an additional eighth coach was added at Paddington, delaying departure until 13:28. Its only stop before Windsor was Slough and when it arrived at the down main platform at 13:37. it was eight minutes late. It was held there for longer than usual; tickets for Windsor trains had to be collected at Slough and there were many more passengers than normal. Signals were set to danger behind it. Meanwhile, behind the local train, the 13:15 express from Paddington to Falmouth Docks was running a couple of minutes late. It comprised GWR 3031 Class engine No. 3015 Kennet pulling ten coaches and was not booked to stop at Slough; its first stop was to be at . The lines through Slough are straight and level and it was travelling at full speed ‚Äì between 50 and 60 mph (80 and 97 km/h) ‚Äì when it approached Slough. Block working Block working was in force on the line; one train was allowed to occupy each section of track. The section including the station was controlled by Slough East signal box; the previous section was controlled by Dolphin signal box. Both sets of signals were set at danger behind the Windsor train. A \\"warning arrangement\\" allows Slough East to accept a train from Dolphin by giving the \\"Section clear but station blocked\\" signal to Dolphin. The latter would then stop the train at his home signal and verbally warn the driver that the line through the station is blocked. The driver is then allowed to proceed. Collision The driver of the 13:15 Falmouth express passed Dolphin box at full speed, ignoring the distant and home signals. The Dolphin signalman immediately tried to telephone Slough East but was unable to get a reply. The Slough East signalman said he had not heard the telephone; the first he knew of the problem was when he heard the 13:15 approaching, much sooner than he had expected. He waved a red flag from the window and shouted to the platform to get the passengers off the Windsor train. The subsequent investigation found that Henry Woodman, the driver of the express had failed to see the Dolphin signals. He also missed the Slough East distant signal. It was the fireman who finally noticed the Slough East home signal was at danger and applied the brakes. The train managed to slow to between 25 and 30 mph when it struck the rear of the standing train, driving it forwards 15 yards. The two rear carriages were \\"completely destroyed\\", \\"the last but one being thrown up to the roof of the station and falling back on to the engine of the second train\\". Two compartments of the next carriage were \\"completely smashed\\". Five passengers were killed; 35 were seriously injured, and 90 complained of shock or minor injuries. The death toll would have been far higher had most of the 450 passengers on board not managed to jump clear in response to the shouted warnings. In addition the brakes of the standing train had been released in preparation for its imminent departure, so the shock of the collision was lessened. Investigation In the subsequent enquiry Woodman could offer no explanation for his inattention: \\"I cannot say in what position the Dolphin signals were. I did not see them. I am at a loss to say how it was that I failed to do so\\", \\"I cannot recollect passing Dolphin signal-box. I do not remember seeing the distant signal for Slough East box\\", \\"I was in my usual health, I did not feel the least sleepy. I had nothing particular to occupy my thoughts that I am aware of\\", \\"I can give no explanation other than that I seem to have lost myself\\". The enquiry ruled that a primary cause of the accident was the poor physical condition of the driver, due to his age (59 years) and fatigue; he had started duty at 05:00 that morning. It recommended that drivers be medically examined at age 55 (rather than 60) and each succeeding year thereafter. The fireman and guard of the express were also criticised. To the fireman's credit he did act decisively when he spotted the Slough East home signal at danger; but it was one of his duties to \\"carefully observe all signals\\" which he did not do earlier. The guard claimed that he was too busy attending to luggage and mailbags to look out for signals; his priorities were supported by the officers of the company but the enquiry pointed out that according to the regulations the \\"safe working of the train\\" should have been his first consideration. Inquests held at Slough and Paddington absolved the driver of blame, but the jury at Windsor found him culpably negligent; he was charged with manslaughter and sent for trial at Reading assizes where the jury verdict of not guilty was met with cheers from the public gallery. Automatic Train Control The enquiry concluded with a response to press suggestions that \\"some mechanical contrivance working in conjunction with the semaphore signals should be adopted, to render it impossible for a driver to pass a danger signal without becoming aware of the fact\\". It warned that the introduction of such a system would lead drivers to rely on it, so paying less heed to the signals themselves. At the time of the accident several such systems were under consideration by railway companies but had \\"not yet emerged from the experimental stage\\". As a result of this accident the Great Western Railway worked to introduce by 1908 a system of Automatic Train Control in which a horn was sounded on the footplate when a Distant signal was passed at caution. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning then the brakes were automatically applied. Braking systems As a direct result of the accident, the prototype Saint class locomotive no. 100 ‚Äì the first of the GWR's many successful 4-6-0 designs ‚Äì was fitted with vacuum brakes on all wheels of the locomotive and tender, rather than just the locomotive's steam brake. While the steam brake on a locomotive was very powerful, it took time to build up pressure on the initial application when the metal surfaces were cold; on a second application it was far more rapid, but this would not occur in an emergency. The GWR had prided itself on their version of the vacuum brake, considering it superior to any other than in use. However, the findings of the accident enquiry dented this pride and the company immediately started experiments into improved vacuum braking systems. In 1903 a revised brake cylinder was introduced, that included 'accelerating valves' allowing air directly into the cylinder in an emergency application.

Plan  The arrangement was worked out between Father Patrick F. McSweeny and the Poughkeepsie School Board. From the 1840s, the school board rented almost all rooms and buildings used as schools in an effort to keep costs low. Over the decades, the school board rented several churches on weekdays and sundry other kinds of buildings, including theaters that stood vacant during the day and disused factories. In 1873, Father McSweeny, rector of St. Peter's parish and its parochial school, approached the school board with what historian Benjamin Justice calls \\"an offer it could not refuse,\\" the use of two newly renovated parochial school buildings for the rent of $1 per year. The school board would pay for all school operating expenses and repairs. The parish would retain ownership of the buildings and complete use of them outside school hours. The arrangement was that the school board hired nuns belonging to the Sisters of Charity, who taught wearing their habits. For his part, Father McSweeny agreed, \\"No religious exercises to be held, nor religious instruction given during the school hours.\\" The schools were formally non-sectarian, admitting children of all faiths, but in practice, they were attended by the children of Catholic families. From the perspective of the city, the virtually-free buildings meant that the schools cost only half what other public schools cost to operate. The Catholic parents and church were pleased because the school board agreed to define the school day as running from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. In practical terms, that meant that the 8:45 morning prayers took place before school hours, a short prayer was held after the official morning session ended at noon, a 30-minute period of religious instruction took place after the lunch hour but before the school day resumed, and a closing prayer was said after the school day ended.  Response  A Catholic newspaper, New York Freeman, condemned the plan as a watering down of true Catholic education. Most of the negative responses, however, came as part of the broader debate over America's common schools from people committed to the idea that having all children attend the same public school was an important way of Americanizing the children of immigrants. Historian Benjamin Justice was unable to discover that there was any opposition in Poughkeepsie itself. Archbishop John Ireland of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis admired the plan and put it into effect in two towns in his diocese, Faribault, Minnesota, and Stillwater, Minnesota. Because Ireland was regarded as dangerously liberal by the predominantly Catholic Church of the era, his support for the Poughkeepsie plan probably helped crystallize Catholic opposition to the model. In 1898, the New York State Superintendent of Schools ruled the plan illegal. The plan ended when he threatened to cut off school funding to Poughkeepsie.
