The main shopping area of Upper Edmonton is often referred to as \\"The Angel\\" by locals (due to its location, The Angel, Edmonton a former public house that was demolished in 1968 to make improvements to the North Circular Road ) and is situated between Lower Edmonton (N9) and Tottenham (N17). Upper Edmonton was once one of the most influential parts of the Borough of Enfield. It is still home to the offices of the area's political parties and provides a range of public services, including the NHS North Middlesex University Hospital. The area is one of the most multicultural in north London, including Afro- Caribbean, Black African, Albanian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Greek (from Cyprus and Greece), Portuguese, Pakistani, Somali and Turkish (from Cyprus and Turkey) communities. The houses of worship in Upper Edmonton reflect this diversity: one of the most visited Muslim mosques in the area, the Edmonton Islamic Centre Al-Masjid, as well as churches of varied denominations, such as the Evangelical church, are located there. Public transportation includes a wide choice of buses serving many locations and British Rail, which has Silver Street and Angel road in the locality. Deprivation score Analysis carried out by the Local Government Association indicates that, within Enfield, Upper Edmonton has been calculated to be the 2nd most deprived of the 21 wards in the Borough. In addition, the same analysis estimates that it is within the 10% most deprived wards in both London and England. Low Income households Upper Edmonton had the 3rd lowest average (median) household income of the 21 wards in Enfield as estimated by CACI in 2018. Average household income in the ward is below the median level for the borough as a whole. The proportion of households with an income of less than ¬£15,000 was put at 24.2% compared to a Borough average of 16.7%. This was the 3rd highest proportion of the 21 wards. Benefit Claimaints At November 2017 the number of people claiming the main working-age DWP benefits was 1,935 ‚Äì 15.2% of the estimated working age population. This is higher than the Enfield Borough average of 12.8% Crime According to data from the Metropolitan Police Service, the crime rate for November 2016 to November 2018 is 281.18 crimes per 1000 population, with the most common offences being related to theft, handling stolen goods, burglary, criminal damage, drugs and robbery. Upper Edmonton has a crime rate 74.87% higher than the overall crime rate for the Borough of Enfield (160.79 crimes per 1000 population for the same time period). During the 12 months to November 2018 compared to the previous 12 months, Upper Edmonton has experienced an 8.48% increase in logged crimes. Recent trends In recent years, the area has undergone a huge structural transformation, of which some work is still undergoing, as part of the government's aim to provide the community with a wider range of shops and public facilities. It is the site of regeneration project, Meridian Water. As in many other parts of the city, a major concern is the level of violent crime, which has steadily increased over the past few years. The effort from local role models to work with government to provide education for local youths is one of the most concentrated methods of trying to overcome this problem.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise responds to a distress call from a Romulan science ship. Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge and Ensign Ro Laren are lost in a transporter accident when returning to the Enterprise with a faulty generator from the Romulan ship. Plot As the Federation starship Enterprise responds to a distress call from a Romulan ship which has suffered an on-board explosion, Ensign Ro and Lieutenant Commander La Forge are seemingly lost in a beam-in from the Romulan ship to the Enterprise. Ro and La Forge find themselves on the Enterprise, unable to interact with the ship or the crew, but able to interact with each other. While La Forge believes they are still alive, Ro sees Dr. Crusher make out their death certificates and believes they are dead; she tries to make peace with her former crewmates as they prepare a funeral service. Lt. Commander Data traces the cause of the transportation accident to the Romulan ship. Ro and La Forge go along with Data and Lt. Worf as they fly a shuttlecraft to the Romulan ship. Aboard, La Forge discovers a phase inverter device, and theorizes that he and Ro are out of phase, and thus undetectable. He also overhears the Romulan crew discussing a plan to transmit a signal to the Enterprise that will cause the warp core to explode the next time the ship enters warp. The two return with Data and Worf to the Enterprise to try to warn the crew, unaware that a Romulan, also out-of-phase, is following them. On board the Enterprise, La Forge watches Data as he analyzes the data from the Romulan ship, and discovers high levels of chronoton emissions, part of the failing of the transporter system. La Forge recognizes that by passing through objects on the ship, he can create those emissions, and tries to encourage Data to study them more, but fails. Ro encounters the Romulan, armed with a disruptor, and leads him on a chase through the walls of the crew quarters, releasing more chronoton radiation that catches Data's interest. When Data enters the room where the Romulan has cornered Ro, La Forge rushes the Romulan, causing him to fly through the external hull of the ship into space. La Forge recovers the disruptor. Although Captain Picard orders the ship into warp after their investigation is complete, Data cautions him to not do so until he completes a sweep of the ship with \\"anyon\\" particles to remove the chronoton radiation. Knowing that time is short before the ship will enter warp, Ro and La Forge head to their funeral--which has become more of a festive wake and celebration--and attempt to phase through objects. They fire the Romulan's disruptor to attract the attention of the attendees. When this does not work, Ro sets the disruptor to overload, causing a large burst of chronoton radiation. Data instructs the computer to sweep Ten Forward with anyon particles, causing Ro and La Forge to temporarily become visible in front of Data and Picard. Data deduces the fate of the crew members, and orders another massive flood of anyon particles, which brings Ro and La Forge back into phase. La Forge is able to warn Engineering about the warp core in time. He and Ro then join their \\"funeral\\" and celebrate with the rest of the crew with a much more joyous tone to the occasion. Reception In 2017 this episode was noted as one featuring scary and/or eerie Star Trek content.

Club career Zhang Xiaobin began his career as an attacking midfielder for the various Shaanxi Guoli youth teams. In 2001, when Shaanxi Guoli sent its youth team to train in Stockport, England, the club Stockport County F.C. would be impressed by the 16-year-old Zhang and take him on loan. While at Stockport Zhang spent three years rising through the youth and then reserve teams, however he was unable to break into the first team. After being unable to obtain a position on the first team of Stockport County, Zhang moved to the Australian league to start his professional senior career with A-League side New Zealand Knights where he made his debut against Queensland Roar on August 28, 2005 in the first game of the 2005‚Äì06 A-League season, which ended in a 2-0 defeat. Throughout the season the club would struggle within the league and Zhang was unable to establish himself as regular within the team, however during his time with the club he would go on to score his first goal against Adelaide United in a 1-1 draw before he left to join Kingston City FC for a short period until he finally moved back to China to play for top tier side Changsha Ginde. At the beginning of the 2007 Chinese Super League Zhang joined Changsha Ginde where he would be gradually converted to a defensive midfielder and would eventually establish himself as vital member of the team while he aided the club to a tenth league standing at the end of the season. For the next several seasons Zhang was a vital player as Changsha continued to be a mid-table team; however, because of his consistency fellow top-tier team Tianjin Teda became interested in him and he transferred to them on 2 April 2010. His move was initially a big success and he was a vital member of the team that came second within the league; however, the next season saw the introduction of Song Chong-Gug and Zhang saw his playing significantly drop. When Tianjin Teda reached the final of the 2011 Chinese FA Cup, club manager Arie Haan dropped Zhang from the cup-winning team and Zhang left the club once Beijing Guoan showed an interest in him.

A post-apocalyptic sport for all occasions', p. 7): An unarmed player, and the only one allowed to touch the skull * Maximum one chain: A player armed with a chain * Three or, if no chain, four enforcers (German term: Pompfer): Armed with their choice of weapons (except chain). May handle the skull with their weapons * Up to three substitutes, who may replace any player =Roles (in the film)= In the film The Salute of the Jugger (or 'The Blood of Heroes'), each role is heard at least once in the dialogue: *Qwik - Kidda (portrayed by Joan Chen) and other characters in the movie refer to this role a few times throughout the movie. *Slash - Sallow (portrayed by Rutger Hauer) is described as one (and refers to others) this role. Both Sallow and Gonzo are described as \\"Slashes\\" in the movie. *Drive - Cim (or Big Cimber, portrayed by Anna Katarina) or Mbulu (portrayed by Delroy Lindo) are described as such, and only once, by Sallow when he, Cim, and Mbulu are debating midway through the movie. *Back Charge - Mbulu (portrayed by Delroy Lindo) or Cim (or Big Cimber, portrayed by Anna Katarina) are described as such, and only once, by Sallow when he, Cim, and Mbulu are debating midway through the movie. *Griffer - When Sallow speaks to Gonzo the first time in the movie, this term is used by Sallow's character once, and may refer to the chain-using player in the game (portrayed on Sallow's team by Vincent D'Onofrio, as 'Young Gar'). Rules =Germany= Based on the rules of the German jugger community, as published at jugger.org: * the paying field is a rectangle with clipped corners - so an octagon * weapons are known as pompfen, and are divided into shields, chains and spars * a team consists of a maximum of 8 players per game: exactly 5 field players and up to 3 substitute players * each team must have exactly 1 runner (\\"qwik\\") on the field * a maximum of 1 chain player is allowed =Australia= The objective of the game is for the team's Qwik to get the foam dog skull, or jugg, into the opposing team's mound to score goals, while minimising the number of goals the opposing team scores within the time limit. The enforcer's role is to defend their Qwik from the opposing players. Positions Australian Rules Jugger is played with two teams of five juggers. Three enforcers with pompfen, one chain and one qwik. Qwiks The Qwik is unarmed and the only player who can carry the skull. The two Qwiks start outside the centre circle and when the game begins wrestle for the skull. The enforcers may not enter the circle until the skull or the whole body of one of the Qwiks leave the circle. A Qwik's hands and forearms are not considered a hit zone and may be used to block. Enforcers The enforcers wield various classes of padded pompfen (listed above) Historically there could only be a maximum of two of the same class of weapon among the other enforcers, but this restriction has been lifted. An enforcer can pin another player by resting their weapon on the hit player at any time while the player is kneeling. Even with paired shorts or Q-tips, a player can only pin one opponent. Chain The position of chain wields a ball-and-chain of plastic and foam up to 320 cm long. The chain can have a 50 cm handle (replacing 50 cm of chain) with a striking surface which can be used to tag opponents for a regular Spar penalty count. Timekeeping Most games consist of two-halves of 150 stones each, while tournament finals are three- thirds of 150 stones. Historically kept by throwing stones against a gong, now other methods such as drums or speakers are used. Stone beats are now 1.5 seconds apart, when previously they had been 2.5 seconds apart for matches of 100 stones per half. Hits Stone penalties for hits vary between countries from three to five for the Spar/Pompfen and five and eight for the chain. Australia played three and five until 2017 when they adopted five and eight. : When a player is hit by the other team they take a knee and are inactive for the count of five stones. : If hit with the ball of the chain they take a knee for a count of eight stones. : Unsafe head hits incur a penalty on the hitter of eight stones for safety. Strike locations are from the neck down (excluding hands on cored weapons or the entire forearm from the elbow down for qwiks). All strikes in jugger are touch, so there is no need to hit heavily or try to cause injury. =Ireland= As with German and Australian Jugger, the goal is to score more points than your opponents within a time limit. These time limits are counted by a regular beat or \\"stones\\" on a drum amounting to about two seconds to every stone. A tournament game is played for two sides of one hundred stones each but during normal training sessions there are no spare players to beat the drum so the game is usually played as the first to 10 points or similar. The game itself is played with two teams of five, with substitutes waiting behind the starting line. A full team consists of a runner, a chain, two staffmen and a chainblocker. Although weapons other than staffs can be used, staffs are by far the most common in Ireland. There can only ever be one chain per team at one time. The pitch itself is rectangular with two \\"mal\\" (German, goals) at either end in the form of a foam square with a depression to receive the skull. The \\"Skull\\", a rubber dogskull serving as the ball, is placed in the middle of the pitch and at the end of a count by the referee or one of the captains both teams run towards the centre of the pitch and try to score. When both lines reach the centre of the pitch the players try to \\"tap\\" each other out. This is done by lightly tapping the opponent with a legal surface of your weapon on a legal body part. In Ireland this means anywhere below the neck and above the wrists. Headshots are avoided and if a pompfe hits the head before a legal target the tap is discounted and the player must withdraw their weapon before hitting again. While a hit on the head after a hit on a legal target is still counted it is frowned upon and avoided. If both players tap each other at the same time, or indiscernibly closely, both players are considered hit and go down. This is unlike in German rules where hits within half a count of each other are allowed. When a player is tapped out they drop to the ground with one knee touching the ground. If they have been hit by a staff or other pompfe, they stay down for five stones. If they have been hit by a chain, they are down for eight stones. The count begins when the knee hits the ground and while the player may move to retrieve a weapon they must return to where they were hit before they start playing. A kneeling player may also pivot around on their knee provided they don't lift it. While they are down another player may \\"pin\\" them by holding their staff on them. A chain player may not do this. As soon as their count is up any player except a runner must attempt to stand again. As soon as their knee leaves the ground they are considered standing and can be hit although they must be \\"fully standing,\\" before they can hit others. As a result of these rules it is possible to abuse them by holding a pompf just above a person waiting to rise. They must rise as soon as they can and they are tapped out for another five stones as soon as they do. As a result, a rule was instituted that a pompf must be either pinning a kneeling player or three feet away, an exception is where there are two players kneeling in close proximity and it is impossible to pin one without having your pompf close to another. The purpose of all this is to break a hole in the opposite line and allow the runner a chance to score. Once a runner scores both teams reset to either end of the pitch, the skull is placed in the centre by the schiri, referee, and the victorious team is awarded the point. The game is quite comparable to Hamburg rules jugger, from which it originates, and is least similar to Australian jugger. Most of the following comes from IADT (Institute of Art, Design and Technology), in Dublin with plans to expand into UCD (University College Dublin) and DCU (Dublin City University), and is also played in the Institute of Technology, Tralee. =United States= Multiple variants exist within the country. Sport Jugger is nearly identical to the European variant, with very subtle rule variations. Another game based on the same movie developed within the Live Action Role Play Amtgard and is referred to there as \\"Jugging\\" and applies the LARP's combat mechanics to the game as seen in the movie. It is basically a battle game within a foam LARP, but very popular. Wasteland Jugger is yet another variant, where participants wear heavy home-made armor and utilize metal weapons. Engagements more like traditional combat, as the game is full-contact and uses such weapons as iron posts, axles, stop signs and metal chains to name a few. The Competitive Underground Jugger League or C.U.J.L. (pronounced \\"cudgel\\") is a group based originally out of the American Midwest that began in 2009. In their league the \\"weapons\\" are made of rattan with impact surfaces padded with strips of mountain bike tire. Helmets, knee guards, and hand protection are required gear as outlined in their Codex. Teams in the league compete each season for the \\"Bucket of Blood\\" trophy. The Carolina Aggressive Jugger Association (C.A.J.A./CAJA) is another American jugger league that aims to hold truer to the movie than its European counterparts. Formed September 2010, they are still refining their rules and regulations. Drawing from C.U.J.L., European leagues, as well as the movie itself; they allow use of much denser cores, hardwoods specifically, (with metal being allowed only on chain weaponry and shields) and require only one layer of closed cell padding at least 1/2 inch thick. This of course insists the implementation of armor covering vital areas; the head, a majority of the ribcage, forearms, shins, and the entire spine, may be eventually required to be protected. Also their field is considerably smaller than most at 75 ft by 40 ft; this is also subject to change. The smaller field was chosen to compensate for the additional fatigue caused by armor usage as well as to place players closer to one another, which CAJA felt was more accurate than the usual playing field. Currently playing skirmishes in Longs, South Carolina (just out of North Myrtle Beach) players ages 14 and up are welcome to come watch or participate as either players or support crew. The USJL (United States Jugger League) is organized with the intention of building Jugger teams that play by similar rules to those found internationally so that the US will have an opportunity to take part in the international tournaments. The USJL rulebook and other information can be found on the USJL website. Jugger Ohio is a group formed in October 2010 that is based in the historic town of Marietta, Ohio. Using very similar rules, field size and equipment as its international counterparts, Jugger Ohio has also embraced social media as a viable way of communicating. It continues to organize weekly and bi-weekly matches via Facebook to great effect. They are organizing the first ever American Jugger tournament, dubbed \\"The Dogskull Classic\\", planned in the style of the German Open. This event is slated for 13 August 2011 in Marietta Ohio. The Red Dirt Jugger Club is based in Oklahoma City and was formed in June 2010. Oklahoma plays with German style rules, and has grown to over 50 members. A league is being formed in the fall of 2012 and 7 teams of 6 have been formed and are preparing for league play. Oklahoma City and its outlying suburbs play every weekend. Hits and strike zones * USA (Jugger Ohio & Red Dirt Jugger Club) : When a player is hit by the other team's enforcers they take a knee and are inactive for the count of five stones. : When a player is hit by the ball or the connecting chain, they take a knee and are inactive for a count of eight stones. : Hits to the hands, head and groin do not count as a hit and the groin and head shots incur an eight stone penalty to the offending player. All else is a legal hit, including feet, shins, legs and arms. A variant of Jugger is played within the UK's Lorien Trust LARP system, the world championship being held at the system's sporting event the Great Edrejan Fayre. Versions of the game are also occasionally played by SCA armoured combat fighters\\"Blood of Heroes\\" event video, from the Kingdom of Calontir Jugger matches are held at the yearly post-apocalyptic festival Wasteland Weekend in California.

It states that the space GL(H) of invertible bounded endomorphisms of H is such that all maps from any finite complex Y to GL(H) are homotopic to a constant, for the norm topology on operators. A significant corollary, also referred to as Kuiper's theorem, is that this group is weakly contractible, ie. all its homotopy groups are trivial. This result has important uses in topological K-theory. General topology of the general linear group For finite dimensional H, this group would be a complex general linear group and not at all contractible. In fact it is homotopy equivalent to its maximal compact subgroup, the unitary group U of H. The proof that the complex general linear group and unitary group have the same homotopy type is by the Gram-Schmidt process, or through the matrix polar decomposition, and carries over to the infinite-dimensional case of separable Hilbert space, basically because the space of upper triangular matrices is contractible as can be seen quite explicitly. The underlying phenomenon is that passing to infinitely many dimensions causes much of the topological complexity of the unitary groups to vanish; but see the section on Bott's unitary group, where the passage to infinity is more constrained, and the resulting group has non-trivial homotopy groups. Historical context and topology of spheres It is a surprising fact that the unit sphere, sometimes denoted S‚àû, in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H is a contractible space, while no finite-dimensional spheres are contractible. This result, certainly known decades before Kuiper's, may have the status of mathematical folklore, but it is quite often cited.John Baez, \\"This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, Week 151\\", Dave Rusin, newsgroup posting http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/93_back/s-infty In fact more is true: S‚àû is diffeomorphic to H, which is certainly contractible by its convexity.C. Bessaga, Every infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is diffeomorphic with its unit sphere. Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci. S√©r. Sci. Math. 14 (1966), 2731. One consequence is that there are smooth counterexamples to an extension of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to the unit ball in H.Andrzej Granas, James Dugundji, Fixed point theory (2003), pp. 82-3. The existence of such counter-examples that are homeomorphisms was shown in 1943 by Shizuo Kakutani, who may have first written down a proof of the contractibility of the unit sphere.S. Kakutani, Topological properties of the unit sphere in Hilbert space, Proc. Imp. Acad. Tokyo 19 (1943), 269‚Äì271. But the result was anyway essentially known (in 1935 Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff showed that the unit sphere was a retract of the unit ball).Andrzej Granas, James Dugundji, p. 108. The result on the group of bounded operators was proved by the Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Kuiper, for the case of a separable Hilbert space; the restriction of separability was later lifted.Luc Illusie, Contractibilit√© du groupe lin√©aire des espaces de Hilbert de dimension infinie, S√©minaire Bourbaki 1964, Exp. No. 284. The same result, but for the strong operator topology rather than the norm topology, was published in 1963 by Jacques Dixmier and Adrien Douady.Lemme 3 on p. 26, Champs continus d‚Äôespaces hilbertiens (PDF), Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France, 91 (1963), p. 227-284. The geometric relationship of the sphere and group of operators is that the unit sphere is a homogeneous space for the unitary group U. The stabiliser of a single vector v of the unit sphere is the unitary group of the orthogonal complement of v; therefore the homotopy long exact sequence predicts that all the homotopy groups of the unit sphere will be trivial. This shows the close topological relationship, but is not in itself quite enough, since the inclusion of a point will be a weak homotopy equivalence only, and that implies contractibility directly only for a CW complex. In a paper published two years after Kuiper's,Richard Palais, Homotopy Theory of Infinite Dimensional Manifolds, Topology, vol. 5, pp.1-16 (1966). Richard Palais provided technical results on infinite-dimensional manifolds sufficient to resolve this issue.E.g. http://math.leetspeak.org/GN/homotopy_groups_of_operator_groups.pdf Bott's unitary group There is another infinite-dimensional unitary group, of major significance in homotopy theory, that to which the Bott periodicity theorem applies. It is certainly not contractible. The difference from Kuiper's group can be explained: Bott's group is the subgroup in which a given operator acts non-trivially only on a subspace spanned by the first N of a fixed orthonormal basis {ei}, for some N, being the identity on the remaining basis vectors. Applications An immediate consequence, given the general theory of fibre bundles, is that every Hilbert bundle is a trivial bundle.Booss and Bleecker, Topology and Analysis (1985), p. 67. The result on the contractibility of S‚àû gives a geometric construction of classifying spaces for certain groups that act freely it, such as the cyclic group with two elements and the circle group. The unitary group U in Bott's sense has a classifying space BU for complex vector bundles (see Classifying space for U(n)). A deeper application coming from Kuiper's theorem is the proof of the Atiyah‚ÄìJ√§nich theorem (after Klaus J√§nich and Michael Atiyah), stating that the space of Fredholm operators on H, with the norm topology, represents the functor K(.) of topological (complex) K-theory, in the sense of homotopy theory. This is given by Atiyah.Michael Atiyah, K-theory p. 153 and p. 162-3, Collected Works volume 2, pp. 590-600. Case of Banach spaces The same question may be posed about invertible operators on any Banach space of infinite dimension. Here there are only partial results. Some classical sequence spaces have the same property, namely that the group of invertible operators is contractible. On the other hand, there are examples known where it fails to be a connected space.Herbert Schr√∂der, On the topology of the group of invertible elements (PDF), preprint survey. Where all homotopy groups are known to be trivial, the contractibility in some cases may remain unknown.

This episode introduces Keiko O'Brien and Data's pet cat, Spot. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, as Data contemplates the impending marriage of his friend Keiko Ishikawa to Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, he learns about the peculiar minutiae - such as last-minute jitters and ballroom dancing - that surround human nuptials. At the same time, he investigates the apparent death of the Vulcan ambassador whom the Enterprise was ferrying to the Neutral Zone in order to conduct treaty negotiations with the Romulans. Plot While commanding the night shift aboard the Enterprise, Data (Brent Spiner) composes a letter to Commander Bruce MaddoxMaddox is a cyberneticist at the Daystrom Institute who was first introduced in the second season episode \\"The Measure of a Man\\" detailing a normal day in his life with a focus on friendship. Data mentions his involvement in the impending wedding of Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and civilian botanist Keiko Ishikawa (Rosalind Chao) where he had been asked to give the bride away. However, when visiting with Keiko she announces that she has decided to call it off, telling Data in frustration that it will make her happier. Data then delivers this news to Chief O'Brien, believing that since O'Brien wants to make Keiko happy, he will be pleased, which he is not. Geordi (LeVar Burton) assures Data that the wedding will proceed as planned. Data discusses the Enterprise mission involving a Vulcan ambassador, T'Pel (Sierra Pecheur), who has arranged a secret meeting with a Romulan ship. Data is assigned as her escort while she is on board. Data then asks Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to teach him how to dance, having discovered from her service record that she won dance competitions. She agrees to instruct him on the condition that he not share this information with the rest of the crew, for fear of again being called 'The Dancing Doctor'. Chief O'Brien asks Data to persuade Keiko to go through with the wedding. He fails yet again, and talks to Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) to try to understand Keiko's decision. T'Pel asks Data about the Enterprise defense capabilities, which Data finds suspicious, but after Data informs her that he has the same safeguards as the ship's computer regarding reporting such requests to Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), she drops the question, stating that she was interested only in testing Data's safeguards. Because Vulcans do not lie, Data decides not to pursue the issue. In the holodeck, Data almost instantly learns how to tap dance from Dr. Crusher before telling her that he is ready to dance at the wedding. Telling him that tap dancing is inappropriate for social dancing she attempts to instruct him in ballroom dancing, but Data finds it much more difficult, as he cannot watch Dr. Crusher's feet. Dr. Crusher is then called away to sickbay to deliver a baby, and Data is left alone with a holographic partner. The Enterprise rendezvous with a Romulan warbird and, despite Picard's unease about the situation, T'Pel transports aboard. However, something interrupts the transporter signal and the ambassador is killed. Finding no flaw in the transporter system, Data uses the principles of Sherlock Holmes to come to the conclusion that T'Pel was not really killed: the Romulans beamed her off the ship themselves and left behind genetic material designed to fool the crew into thinking that she died in a transporter accident. Picard speeds back to intercept the Romulans in the middle of the neutral zone. He confronts the Romulan Admiral Mendak (Alan Scarfe) and learns that T'Pel is actually a Romulan spy. Before shots are fired, another Romulan warbird appears next to the first one and three more enter the sector, minutes away. Picard is forced to retreat into Federation space. Data approaches Keiko to make amends. She informs him that she is not angry at him, and that the wedding will proceed as planned. Miles and Keiko are married by Captain Picard. Data notes that although there are many emotions that he does not understand and cannot share, he does understand the emotion of love and belonging. Later, in Sickbay, the captain and Data visit the newest member of the Enterprise crew‚Äîa baby born while the Enterprise was in mortal peril.  Production  This was the first episode with Data's cat, Spot. Reception WIRED magazine ranked \\"Data's Day\\" as one of the best of Star Trek: The Next Generation in a 2012 review. They praise masterful acting by Brent Spiner as Data throughout the episode, offering what they call a \\"Pinocchio perspective\\" on the plot. In 2019, ThoughtCo ranked \\"Data's Day\\" as the 7th best episode of this series, pointing out it has special and emotional view of a day aboard the Enterprise-D. In 2019, Den of Geek noted this episode for featuring romantic elements, pointing out the wedding of Miles O'Brien (i.e. Chief O'Brien) and Keiko. This episode was noted by the Chicago Tribune in 1996 for introducing the character of Keiko as played by actress Rosalind Chao, she was also featured as a reoccurring character on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. This episode was noted in To Boldly Go: Essays on Gender and Identity in the Star Trek Universe for featuring the marriage of Keiko and O'Brien, which was the only successful long term relationship in the entirety of Star Trek. They also note that their stories are continued on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and that they go on to have two children, Molly and Kirayoshi. In 2019, Screen Rant ranked \\"Data's Day\\" the seventh funniest episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 2020, Gamespot recommended this episode for background on the character of Data.

Early life and career According to the Chicago Tribune, his interest in magic started when he was six. As a youngster, he saw performances by Thurston and Houdini. In later years, he admitted to dozing off in the midst of Houdini's show. After only a year at college, he went on to be a professional entertainer instead, initially working out of Boston. He later moved to New York City where he met Naomi Baker, daughter of Al Baker, then Dean of American Magicians. Naomi married Marshall and they had two sons, James and Alexander (\\"Sandy\\"). During World War II, Marshall was \\"island hopping\\" in the Pacific to entertain military personnel in USO shows. He became tired of taking his elaborate ventriloquist's dummy called Henry with him, so he decided to use a white glove and some bunny ears to turn his left hand into his dummy, \\"Lefty\\". Marshall often described the transition from his use of a traditional vent dummy to the development of his glove puppet rabbit commenting that the \\"dummy wouldn't carry the suitcase.\\" Originally made from a khaki army glove, when Marshall was discharged from the army, he replaced it with a white dress glove. While performing in Las Vegas, at the suggestion of one of Marshall's friends, the puppet was further transformed into a rabbit by affixing two fingers from a separate glove to it, thus forming a pair of perky ears. Over his 60-year career he appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show 14 times together with his glove puppet rabbit dummy, \\"Lefty\\". He also played the New York Palace and London's Palladium. Marshall was the opening act for performers like Frank Sinatra, Milton Berle and Liberace. He was the first act to open for Sinatra in Las Vegas. In Marshall's later years, he was honored with the title of \\"Dean of American Magicians\\" by the Society of American Magicians. Personal Marshall was born in Abington, Massachusetts. He spent a year at Bluefield College in Virginia. In the 1950s, Marshall moved to Chicago and married fellow magician and magic dealer Frances Ireland. Together they operated the Ireland Magic Company at 109 North Dearborn St. in the Chicago Loop. In 1963, the firm was relocated to the North side of Chicago at 5082 North Lincoln Ave., and renamed it Magic Inc.. Marshall's reputation as an all-knowing historian of stage magic, vaudeville and entertainment grew through the years, as did his legendary collection of books, posters and assorted ephemera on a wide range of subjects. He died at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago after a series of heart attacks. He was 85 and is survived by his son Alexander; another son, James; a sister, Marjorie Bamman; five grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. James Randi remembers Jay Marshall during the JREF Amazing Adventure 4, March 8‚Äì15, 2009.

Personal life Kasimir was born in 1881 at Pettau, today Ptuj, Slovenia, then a part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. He inherited his talent from his ancestors; his grandfather was a painter and a poet, and his father an officer in the Habsburg army, who later became a professional painter. Kasimir attended the Vienna Academy of Art where he studied under Wilhelm Unger, who introduced him to the technique of the coloured etching, and also to his future wife, the artist Tanna Hoernes. He died in 1962 in Grinzing, a suburb of Vienna. Techniques Kasimir was among the first to develop the technique of the coloured etching. Before this, prints were usually hand-coloured with the colour being applied in a casual, haphazard manner. Kasimir would first create a sketch‚Äîusually in pastel. He then transferred the design on as many as four to six plates, printing one after the other and applying the colour on the plate‚Äîall done by hand. Genres Kasimir is mainly famous for his etchings, but he also produced some oil painting, as well as some pastels. One of his favourite genres was the landscape, or veduta. He demonstrated a predisposition for monuments, street scenes, and tourist landmarks. He depicted places from all over Europe, mainly Italy, Austria, and Germany. He also travelled to the United States to do a series of etchings of famous sights ranging from urban landmarks such as New York City skyscrapers to natural wonders like Yosemite Valley. Luigi Kasimir‚Äôs etchings can be seen in many galleries and museums, from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art to countless galleries and fine print collections around the world. He designed a bookplate for Sigmund Freud, who also hung an etching of the Roman Forum by Kasimir in his consulting room.

The Danish word slot , like the word schloss in the related Germanic language‚Äî modern German‚Äî can mean either castle, a Country house or palace, in accordance with common English usage. Whenever possible traditional English translations provided by the Danish Palaces and Properties Agency, a national agency maintaining and utilising the states palaces, castles and gardens, have been used to determine whether a property should be called a castle or a palace. When not possible the following guidelines, which are in general keeping with the above translations, and with Wikipedia articles have been used: * Castle: Generally older building, generally a fortified building * Palace: Generally newer building, generally a non-fortified building used primarily as a residence  Other related words  The Danish word borg, which appears at the end of many castle and palace names literally means \\"fortified castle\\", but it is no clear indication that the property is indeed fortified. For example, Amalienborg is translated as Amalienborg Palace. The Danish word pal√¶ translates to \\"mansion\\", and is most often used as an indication of a non-royal, urban mansion.

Description A detailed description of the bugonia process can be found in byzantine Geoponica:Geoponica, XV, 2, 22 sqq.. > Build a house, ten cubits high, with all the sides of equal dimensions, with > one door, and four windows, one on each side; put an ox into it, thirty > months old, very fat and fleshy; let a number of young men kill him by > beating him violently with clubs, so as to mangle both flesh and bones, but > taking care not to shed any blood; let all the orifices, mouth, eyes, nose > etc. be stopped up with clean and fine linen, impregnated with pitch; let a > quantity of thyme be strewed under the reclining animal, and then let > windows and doors be closed and covered with a thick coating of clay, to > prevent the access of air or wind. After three weeks have passed, let the > house be opened, and let light and fresh air get access to it, except from > the side from which the wind blows strongest. Eleven days afterwards, you > will find the house full of bees, hanging together in clusters, and nothing > left of the ox but horns, bones and hair. The story of Aristaeus was an archetype of this ritual, serving to instruct bee keepers on how to recover from the loss of their bees. By extension, it was thought that fumigation with cow dung was beneficial to the health of the hive. =Variations= The idea that wasps are born of the corpses of horses was often described alongside bugonia. And given that European wasps bear a passing resemblance to European bees, it may be possible that the myth arose out of a mis-reported or misunderstood observation of a natural event. Different variations are attested, such as simply burying the cow, or covering the corpse with mud or dung. Another variation states that use of the rumen alone is sufficient. In Ancient Egypt the ox would be buried with its horns projecting above the surface of the ground. When severed, bees would emerge from the base of the horns.Antigonus of Carystus through Beckmann Bugonia is described twice in the second half of Virgil's Georgics and frames the Aristaeus epyllion in the second half. The first description, opening the second half of the fourth book, describes a 'traditional' form of the ritual, followed by the tale of Aristaeus, who after losing his bees, descends to the home of his mother, the nymph Cyrene, where he is given instructions on how to restore his colonies. He must capture the seer, Proteus, and force him to reveal which divine spirit he angered. Proteus changes into many forms but is bound at last and recounts how he caused the death of Eurydice, thus angering the nymphs. the ritual demanded of Aristaeus by Cyrene upon his return is markedly different. He is to sacrifice four bulls, four heifers, a black sheep and a calf in an open glen. This second version served as the climax of a large work so may be based more on the traditional Roman sacrificial ritual than bugonia itself in order to close the Georgics in a more symbolically appropriate way. Thus the first version can reflect man's relation to the gods in the Golden Age and the later the current relation.Thomas Habinek (1990). Sacrifice, Society, and Vergil's Ox-born Bees. UC Berkeley: Department of Classics, UCB.  Etymology  Bougonia comes from the Greek \\"Œ≤Œø·ø¶œÇ\\", meaning \\"ox\\" and \\"Œ≥ŒøŒΩŒÆ\\" meaning \\"progeny\\". Furthermore, the expressions \\"bugen√®s melissae\\" and \\"taurigenae apes\\" meant \\"oxen-born bees\\" and the ancient Greeks would sometimes simply call honey bees \\"bugen√®s\\" or \\"taurigenae\\".Johann Heinrich Voss, Virgil's Georgics p277; 1789 Ancient attestation Perhaps the earliest mention is by Nicander of Colophon.Nicander of Colophon, Theriaca, 741.Nicander of Colophon, Alexipharmaca, 447. The process is described by Virgil in the fourth book of the Georgics.Virgil, Georgica, IV, 284 sqq. Many other writers mention the practice.Ovid, Fasti, I, 376-78.Ovid, Metamorphoseon libri, XV, 365-66.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis historia, XI, 23 (70), 21, 47 (81).Claudius Aelianus, De natura animalium, II, 57.Servius, In Vergilii carmina comentarii. Georgica, IV, 285 and 286.Libanius, Progymnasmata, exercises in enconium and invective, 8, 15.Isidore of Seville, Origines, XII, 8, 2.Sextus Empiricus, Œ†œÖœÅœÅœéŒΩŒµŒπŒøŒπ Œ•œÄŒøœÑœÖœÄœéœÉŒµŒπœÇ, I, 41.Porphyry of Tyre, Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºêŒΩ ·ΩàŒ¥œÖœÉœÉŒµŒØ·æ≥ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒùœÖŒºœÜ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºåŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÖ, 15 and 18.Origen, Contra Celsum, 4, 57 In the Hermetic Cyranides it is reported that worms are born after one week and bees after three weeks. Florentinus of the Geoponica reports the process as a proven and obvious fact: > If any further evidence is necessary to enhance the faith in things already > proved, you may behold that carcases, decaying from the effect of time and > tepid moisture, change into small animals. Go, and bury slaughtered oxen -- > the fact is known from experience -- the rotten entrails produce flower- > sucking bees, who, like their parents, roam over pastures, bent upon work, > and hopeful of the future. A buried war-horse produces the hornet. =Scepticism= Pre-dating Nicander by a century, Aristotle never mentions bugonia and dismisses generation of bees from other animals. Furthermore, he is able to distinguish the castes of drone, worker, and \\"king\\" so he would certainly have been able to distinguish bees from their mimics. Later authors mention bugonia in commentaries on Aristotle's Physics. Archelaus calls bees the \\"factitious progeny of a decaying ox\\".Archelaus, through Marcus Terentius Varro Celsus and Columella are recorded as having opposed the practice. Later sources Aristeas and bugonia. Virgil's Georgics. Lyon. 1517 Pietro de' Crescenzi refers to Bugonia circa 1304. In 1475, Konrad of Megenberg, in the first German book of natural history, claimed that the bees are born from the skin and the stomach of an ox. Michael Herren gives a detailed description of bugonia drawn from Geoponica. Johannes Colerus whose book constituted the book of reference for many generations of apiarists expresses the same belief in bugonia. The method appears even in European apiculture books of the 1700s. In Abrahamic religions A similar story of the creation of bees is seen in the Book of Judges, where Samson puts forward the riddle of \\"out of the strong came forth sweetness,\\" referring to a swarm of bees found inside a dead lion The bugonia belief is also reported in the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud. Philo offers this origin of bees as a possible reason why honey is forbidden as a sacrifice to Yahweh. Origin of the belief Bee and wasp mimics are diverse. One explanation claims that any of the numerous Batesian mimics of bees with scavenger larva were mistaken for bees (\\"footless at first, anon with feet and wings\\"). More specifically, the hoverfly Eristalis tenax has received particular attention. While not providing honey, these flies would have been productive pollinators. Others argue that bee keepers would have understood that flies do not produce honey and give the explanation that Apis mellifera (western honey bee) resorts to any cavity, and in particular cavities of trees and rocks, but also in skulls and in thoracic cavities of large animal carcasses in which to construct a nest. There is one, possibly apocryphal, attestation of actual usage of a man's skull by wasps. In popular culture A tin of Lyle's Golden Syrup The story of Samson and the bees is celebrated on tins of Tate & Lyle golden syrup. William Shakespeare knew of bugonia as he says in Henry IV: \\"Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb, in the dead carrion\\".

It is also a harbor and inshore patrol and security team that includes detecting and, if necessary, stopping or arresting submerged divers, using the Underwater Port Security System. It is the only special operations group that can arrest submerged divers. MSSTs were created under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) in direct response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and they are a part of the United States Department of Homeland Security's layered strategy directed at protecting seaports and waterways. MSSTs provide waterborne and a modest level of shore- side counter-terrorism force protection for strategic shipping, high interest vessels, and critical infrastructure. MSSTs are a quick response force capable of rapid nationwide deployment via air, ground or sea transportation in response to changing threat conditions and evolving Maritime Homeland Security (MHS) mission requirements. Multi-mission capability facilitates augmentation for other selected Coast Guard missions. MSST personnel receive training in Advanced Tactical Boat Operations and counter-terrorism force protection at the Joint Maritime Training Center at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The MSSTs operate as part of the Coast Guard's Deployable Operations Group (DOG); now called Deployable Specialized Forces (DSF), they are under operational control of the Coast Guard's corresponding Pacific and Atlantic Area commands, as well as an active reserve component of the White House on request.

It includes the Underwater Inspection System (UIS) and the Integrated Anti-Swimmer System (IAS). Recent developments in terrorism have highlighted the need for underwater anti-frogman security. The UPSS is made in the United States and is reported to be compact enough fit in a large suitcase. The Coast Guard unveiled the system in February 2005 at the Coast Guard Integrated Support Command in San Pedro, California. Ship Protection System The Ship Protection System or SPS is a ship-based underwater threat detection system manufactured by FarSounder, Inc. Based on FarSounder's 3D forward looking sonar, their SPS offers 360¬∞ coverage of underwater threats to vessels at anchor or at dock. This is a commercial product suitable for mega yachts. SAES develops an active sonar DDS-03 (diver detection sonar) that has been specifically designed for the detection of underwater threats such as divers and manned and unmanned underwater vehicles (SDV, ROV or UUV), offering protection and surveillance to counter the threat of underwater attacks against harbours, critical facilities, ships, offshore platforms, coastal power plants, shipwrecks, environmentally protected areas and maritime special events. Underwater Inspection System The Underwater Inspection System or UIS is a system manufactured by CodaOctopus and consists of the unique Echoscope Real Time 3D Sonar that is used to scan the underwater environment in zero visibility waters. The UIS system can be mounted on a small boat to scan harbor walls, piers, bridges for an underwater threat and can be used to complement long range diver detection systems by classifying the threat in 3D in real time. The same system can be mounted on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to create 3D ship hull scans detecting small mine size objects. Integrated Anti-Swimmer System The Integrated Anti-Swimmer System is a United States Coast Guard underwater anti-diver ultrasound weapons system. IAS includes:- *SM2000 (Underwater Surveillance System), a search sonar made by Kongsberg Maritime. *An underwater warning loudspeaker. *An underwater shockwave emitter that can force divers to surface, or stun or kill them. The US Coast Guard calls it an \\"nonlethal interdiction acoustic impulse\\". It can track underwater objects, similarly to an air traffic control radar. Like other systems, such as the Cerberus or DDS-03 are semi-intelligent and can distinguish humans from marine animals, partly because of their different shapes and typical movements underwater. This is not impeded by darkness or fog or low underwater visibility, and is a great improvement on scanning the water surface by eye from above.http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,uscg1_031405.00.html Mission Detection: The Underwater Port Security System Various test attempts by MSST divers to trick the system did not work. In most cases the detected diver would be warned by the underwater loudspeaker; after that, the shockwave emitter would be fired once as a warning, before it is fired to stun or kill. Other Anti-Swimmer-based systems that have been invented, instead of shock- waves, use sound-waves which 'disrupt' the diver causing sickness and disorientation. This technique is considered non-lethal and has been developed using an array of underwater speakers.http://www.wi- ltd.com/defence/Maritime_Defence/Acoustic_Defence_Systems/Enforcer_Underwater_CommunicationDiver_Disruption_System References External links * DDS-03 - Intruder Detection Sonar * Mission Detection: The Underwater Port Security System * CNN: Coast Guard to unveil security system Category:United States Coast Guard Category:Underwater security Category:Diver-detector sonars Category:Deployable Operations Group ","title":"Underwater Port Security System"},{"id":"2993879","text":"thumb David Pareus (30 December 1548 ‚Äì 15 June 1622) was a German Reformed Protestant theologian and reformer. Life He was born at Frankenstein in Schlesien on 30 December 1548. He was apprenticed to an apothecary and again to a shoemaker. In 1564 he entered the school of Christoph Schilling at Hirschberg, whom he accompanied to Amberg, in 1566; but immediately entered the Collegium Sapientiae, at Heidelberg. His father disinherited him because of the opinions that David formed during his studies, under Zacharias Ursinus. On 13 May 1571 he became pastor at Niederschlettenbach and six months later a teacher in the Paedagogium at Heidelberg. On 24 August 1573 he resumed the pastorate in the previously Roman Catholic village of Hemsbach; where, with the consent of the congregation, he reconstructed the church along Reformed lines. Dismissed from his office after the death of Frederick III, Elector Palatine, Pareus was appointed, in 1577, by Count Palatine Johann Casimir, pastor at Oggersheim. Transferred to Winzingen in 1580, he cultivated acquaintance with the teachers at the Casimirianum, in the neighboring Neustadt. After the death of Ludwig VI, Johann Casimir, acting as regent of the Palatinate, called Pareus as teacher to the Collegium Sapientiae in September 1584. Pareus became the director of the Collegium in 1591. In 1598, he entered the theological faculty as teacher of the Old Testament and from 1602 until his death he taught the New Testament. He attracted many students from far and wide. From 1592, he belonged to the Palatine church council. In September 1621, as the Spanish troops approached the Palatinate, Pareus fled to Annweiler, and later to Neustadt. Then, when Frederick V, Elector Palatine returned temporarily to the Palatinate, Pareus returned to Heidelberg, in May 1622, where he died on 15 June 1622. He was survived only by his son Philipp (1576-1648), who issued his father's writings, to which he pre fixed a life (Frankfort, 1647). Works Pareus began his literary activity with a tract against the doctrine of ubiquity, Methodus ubitquitariae controversiae (Neustadt, 1586). Polemical matter accompanied his issue of the Neustadter Bibel, 1587, an edition of Luther's translation, with appended table of contents and superscriptions. Jakob Andrea, in his Christliche Erinnerung (Tabingen, 1589), styled this publication an \\"arrant piece of knavery\\"; while Pareus, in Rettung der Neustadter Bibel (Neustadt, 1589), answered in a more moderate tone. Pareus further contended against Johann Georg Siegwart in Sieg der Neust√§dtischen Bibel (Neustadt, 1591), and with Egidius Hunnius, in 1593-99, who accused him of the judaizing error of the Reformed party, with Clypeus veritatis catholicae de sacrosancta trinitate and Orthodoxus Calvinus. He also issued various tracts against the papacy (1604‚Äì17). Despite these many literary battles, Pareus was by nature irenic. In constructive activity were the many editions, after 1593, of his Summarische Erkl√§rung der Katholischen in der Churpfalz ge√ºbten Lehre; and his numerous commentaries on the Old and New Testament Scriptures (published 1605-1618). In the Irenicum sive de unione et synodo evangelicorum liber votivus (Heidelberg, 1614-1615), he proposed a general synod of all Evangelicals to unite the Lutherans and the Calvinists, who, he represents, were surely at one in every essential. On only one point, however, not affecting the foundation of belief, was there divergence. This appeal of Pareus brought little response from his contemporaries, and his overture for peace was rejected by the Lutheran theologians Hutter and Siegwart. Pareus advocated calling rulers to account for their actions. These opinions were viewed with suspicion by the absolute monarchy of James I of England. In 1622, authorities in Oxford were ordered to search libraries and bookshops and to burn every copy of his work.

The first version of the game was released in South Korea and was later followed by Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Indonesia, Portuguese and English translations. The North American/European version of the game launched its retail phase on February 21, 2006. A mixture of science fiction and classic fantasy, RF Online is set in a distant planet in the Novus system where magic exists alongside high technology. Like most MMORPGs it follows the typical fantasy setting complete with swords and sorcery, but it also emphasizes the three-way Race vs. Race vs. Race (RvRvR) concept and modern/futuristic technology such as mecha and nuclear weapons. The NA/EU game service was brought down as of November 9, 2008, due to licence expiration. However, the developers, CCR have started to relaunch the game hosting it themselves for NA/EU. In August 2012, RF Online was confirmed to relaunch stateside via the publisher GamesCampus. RFO is a free-to-play game. RF Online version 1.5 launched via the publisher GamesCampus Europe in April 2013. RF Online version 1.5 launched via the publisher GamesCampus Europe in January 2015. On April 18, 2016, it was revealed CCR filed a trademark for \\"RF 2\\", and listing it as a \\"downloadable software\\" for various platforms, including virtual reality. In November 2017, Playpark a subsidiary of Asiasoft announced that they will relaunch the game in the Philippines. Playpark RF Online is currently owned by RebellionGamingInc. In September 2020, Netmarble acquires the rights for RF Online and announced the Mobile Game Version development will be started in short time Gameplay As with many MMORPGs, the player will select one race and fight monsters to gain experience points. RFO is populated with many different monsters across many areas. At the start of the game, a character will be led through an in-game guide of the basic commands for the game. From there, the character will be exposed to a series of quests which will familiarize him/her with their character's headquarters. As the character progresses in level, his/her quests may take them out to aggressive maps, where he/she will be exposed to the player killing Features of the game. One quest given in the Sette Desert on low levels makes players aware of constant presence and danger of enemy races. Political Factions There are 3 character races which the player can choose: Bellato Union, Holy Alliance Cora, and Accretian Empire. each having a unique race specialty. Every race has their own special sub-classes of characters to play based on warrior, ranger, specialist and each race's special classes. The Accretian Empire relies heavily on technology, so they lack access to magic. The Holy Alliance of Cora uses both magic and technology, but relies more on offensive magic. The Bellato Union uses both magic and technology but relies more on technology for offense and uses magic more on support. Class advancements become available at level 30 and 40. It is also possible to cross-class a character within the races for a wide variety of options. Economy The game's economy can be divided into two parts - production and consumption. The mine is a new field where resources are produced as a part of and in support of economic activity. Mining for minerals and processing the products of these produce many kinds of items. These form the basis for conflict within the mines. =Chip War= The battle for resources is actualized in an all-out war among the three races termed as Chip War. Chip War happens three times in a day, where the winning race obtains the right to control the guardian of the mines - the dreaded Holystone Keeper. The war is led by the respective racial leaders, whose goal is to break at least one control chip owned by the opposing race. PVP Unlike most MMORPGs, RF Online revolves around PvP (Player vs Player). Only the racial headquarters, and select portal locations, are considered as safe areas from enemy races. Player killing comes into play because of the battle for resources between the three races. By default, opposing races members may engage in combat at any point in time on aggressive maps. Same race players may not engage in combat, unless by virtue of an item called the Chaos Potion, or during a special in-race competition called the Guild Circle Zone Scramble, also known as Guild Wars.

(also known as The Sheriff) is a 1969 American comedy Western film directed by Burt Kennedy and starring James Garner, Joan Hackett, and Walter Brennan. The supporting cast features Harry Morgan, Jack Elam, Bruce Dern, and Chubby Johnson. The picture was distributed by United Artists and produced by William Bowers (who also wrote the screenplay) and Bill Finnegan. The film parodies the iconic story of the Western hero who tames a lawless frontier town. Its title was derived from a popular 1960s campaign slogan \\"Support Your Local Police\\". Plot The Old West town of Calendar, Colorado, springs up almost overnight when clumsy, hotheaded Prudy Perkins (Hackett) notices gold in a freshly dug grave during a funeral. Her father Olly (Morgan) becomes mayor of the new settlement. Other members of the town council (Henry Jones, Walter Burke) and he bemoan the town's descent into chaos and corruption, and are tired of the tolls exacted on their gold shipments by the Danbys, a family of near-outlaws who control the only shipping route out of town. The town has no sheriff, as most people are too busy prospecting, and the few who have taken the job have been run out of town or killed. Jason McCullough (Garner), a confident and exceptionally skilled gunfighter who says he is only passing through town on his way to Australia, sees Joe Danby (Dern) gun down a man in the town's saloon. Needing money after encountering the town's ruinous rate of inflation, McCullough takes the job of sheriff, impressing the mayor and council with his uncanny marksmanship. He breaks up a street brawl, and later at the Perkins house meets Prudy, despite her attempts to avoid him due to her embarrassing circumstances. McCullough arrests Joe and tosses him in the town's unfinished jail, which lacks bars for the cell doors and windows, keeping the dimwitted Joe in his cell through tricks and psychology. McCullough acquires a reluctant deputy in scruffy Jake (Elam), previously known as the \\"town character\\". Joe's arrest infuriates his father, Pa Danby (Brennan), who is not accustomed to his family being challenged. Pa Danby mounts various attempts to get Joe out of jail, and when those fail, sends in a string of hired guns, whom McCullough defeats with ease. Meanwhile, McCullough enlists Jake's help in an unsuccessful attempt to prospect for gold, and spars romantically with Prudy. After numerous failures to reassert himself over McCullough and the town, Pa Danby enlists a host of his relatives to launch an all-out assault. When the news reaches McCullough, he initially tells Prudy he has decided to simply leave town and resume his trip to Australia, but when she expresses her sincere approval of this sensible idea, he declares it to be cowardly and announces he is staying, instead. The rest of the townsfolk officially vote to stay out of the conflict, and not help in any way. Thus, the Danby clan rides in faced only by McCullough, Jake, and Prudy. After a lengthy but unproductive gunfight, McCullough bluffs his way to victory using Joe as a hostage and the old cannon mounted in the center of town. As all the Danbys are marched off to jail, the supposedly unloaded cannon fires, smashing Madame Orr's, the town brothel, and scattering the resident prostitutes and the four civic leaders who were inside. Sheriff McCullough and Prudy get engaged. In a closing monologue, Jake breaks the film's fourth wall and directly informs the audience that they get married and McCullough goes on to become governor of the state of Colorado, never making it to Australia (although he reads about it a lot), while Jake becomes sheriff and \\"one of the most beloved characters in Western folklore\\".

Early in pre- production, Paramount Pictures threatened a lawsuit as the studio contended that the first scene was \\"lifted\\" from their musical Paint Your Wagon (1969) where a similar gold mine discovery is featured.

The Aponogetonaceae is considered to be allied to the Potamogetonaceae - Najadaceae complex of families. In recent decades the family has had universal recognition by taxonomists. The APG system (1998) and APG II system (2003) treat it in the order Alismatales in the clade monocots. The family consists of only one genus, Aponogeton, with 56 known species (Christenhusz & Byng 2016 ) of aquatic plants, most of which have been included in a molecular phylogeny by Chen et al. (2015). The name was published in Supplementum Plantarum 32: 214 (1782) and is derived from a geographic location neighboring (geton) the Apono tribal district of coastal Gabon.Punu (Apono) Some species are used as ornamental plants in aquariums. Distribution They are aquatic plants, which are found in tropical to warm temperate regions of Africa, Asia and Australasia.Watson, L. & Dallwitz, M. J. (1992 onwards): Aponogetonaceae Aponogeton distachyos is originally from South Africa but has become naturalised in South Australia, Western South America, and Western Europe. Individual plants are not always easy to identify due to hybridization (particularly those sold as A. crispus - which are often cultivated hybrids with A. natans or A. rigidifolius). Generally an Aponogeton from Asia will have a single bloom stalk, while those from African heritage (including Madagascar) will have multiple blooming stems on the same flower stalk. Even though seventeen species are found in Africa, only one of them, A. distachyos, has been continuously maintained as a plant in garden ponds. Several of the eleven Madagascan species have been introduced as new aquarium plants in the early 21st century. At present, the following plants from Madagascar are in culture: Aponogeton boivinianus, A. longiplumulosus, A. madagascariensis and A. ulvaceus. Additionally, Aponogeton bernierianus, A. capuronii, A. decaryi and A. tenuispicatus have been imported on several occasions but have not achieved any wider distribution because they are difficult to maintain. From the sixteen representatives of this genus from Asia and Australia, A. crispus, A. elongatus, A. rigidifolius, A. robinsonii and A. undulatus are useful aquarium plants. Aponogeton jacobensii, A. natans and A. loriae, too, were cultivated several times but have not proven themselves under aquarium conditions. Ecology A. distachyos, habit, showing aerial and submerged parts Many species grow in temporarily still or flowing waters and live through the dry period as a dormant tuber. They are fully aquatic herbaceous plants with milky sap, becoming dormant during drought conditions. Most species grow from tubers. Most Asian species remain submerged all year round, while the starchy tubercles of the African species are able to survive the dry season by shedding their leaves and undergoing a dormant period. Almost all Aponogeton species go through resting and growth phases in their natural locations, triggered by the local ecological conditions. During growth periods, the plant will deposit proteins, fats, carbohydrates and mineral substances in the storage rhizome or tuber During the resting period, the tuber survives in the soil in order to again sprout during the following vegetation period. Tubers in Aponogeton species have a high resistance to drying out. This ability to store water is exploited, for instance, in the annual export of thousands of dormant A. crispus specimens, shipped in large bags in a totally dry state. Economic uses The tubers of several species are eaten by humans and their livestock. Some are grown as ornamental plants in aquariums or ponds. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that \\"The tuberous roots of these water-plants are starchy, and of excellent taste, though not large\\". Cultivation An African Aponogeton with a triple flower spike. All Aponogeton species are easy to grow when their preferences are met. The Madagascar lace plants (A. madagascarensis) require special handling as they prefer cooler water ‚Äì as a maximum. As of 2010, the Australian species exist in very small numbers in the hobby trade. Rest periods The African species in particular, (with the exception of A. rigidifolius, which has a rhizome and not a tuber, experience a natural rest period, corresponding to their habitat drying out in the wild. The Asian species may also have a rest period, but this is related only to temperature. As the plant stops growing, it can be taken out of the pond or aquarium and put in a bowl of damp sand. Keep the bowl in a dark, cool place, with the sand kept damp, for approximately 2‚Äì3 months at a temperature of about , until small leaves are seen to sprout from the tuber, when they can be returned to the pond or aquarium.Gesting, B.

It is the most comprehensive trading agreement that New Zealand has negotiated, with the exception of the Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia. The CEP aims to build on the close historical ties between Singapore and New Zealand by improving opportunities for trade in goods, services and investment. In September 1999, New Zealand and Singapore announced intentions to negotiate a trade agreement. New Zealand PM Helen Clark and PM Goh Chok Tong signed the Agreement between New Zealand and Singapore on a Closer Economic Partnership (ANZSCEP), in a signing ceremony held on 14 November 2000 in Singapore. Singapore hosted the 1st Ministerial Review of the Agreement in November 2001, while New Zealand hosted the 2nd Ministerial Review of the Agreement in July 2004. The CEP is comprehensive, covering goods, services, investment and technical and hygiene/quarantine barriers to trade in goods. Over the 2 years since the agreement came into effect, Singapore's bilateral trade with New Zealand rose from $0.97 billion (2000) to S$1.09 billion (2002), an increase of 12.6%. Beyond providing improved market access, the ANZSCEP also brings economic cooperation between Singapore and New Zealand to new heights.

While the International System of Units (SI) defines multiples based on powers of ten (like k = 103, M = 106, etc.), a different definition is sometimes used in computing, based on powers of two (like k = 210, M = 220, etc.) This is due to the use of binary addressing for computer memory locations. In the early years of computing, there was no significant error in using the same prefix for either quantity (210 = 1024 and 103 = 1000 are equal, to two significant figures). Thus, the SI prefixes were borrowed to indicate nearby binary multiples for these computer-related quantities. Meanwhile, manufacturers of storage devices, such as hard disks, traditionally used the standard decimal meanings of the prefixes, and decimal multiples are used for transmission rates and processor clock speeds as well. As technology improved, all of these measurements and capacities increased. As the binary meaning was extended to higher prefixes, the absolute error between the two meanings increased. This has even resulted in litigation against hard drive manufacturers, because some operating systems report the size using the larger binary interpretation. Moreover, there is not a consistent use of the symbols to indicate quantities of bits and bytes ‚Äì the unit symbol \\"Mb\\", for instance, has been widely used for both megabytes and megabits. IEEE 1541 sets new recommendations to represent these quantities and unit symbols unambiguously. After a trial period of two years, in 2005, IEEE 1541-2002 was elevated to a full-use standard by the IEEE Standards Association, and was reaffirmed on 27 March 2008. IEEE 1541 is closely related to Amendment 2 to IEC International Standard IEC 60027-2. The IEC standard was harmonized into the common ISO/IEC IEC 80000-13:2008 ‚Äì Quantities and units ‚Äì Part 13: Information science and technology. This standard uses 'bit' as the symbol for bit, as opposed to 'b'. Recommendations IEEE 1541 recommends: * a set of units to refer to quantities used in digital electronics and computing: ** bit (symbol 'b'), a binary digit; ** byte (symbol 'B'), a set of adjacent bits (usually, but not necessarily, eight) operated on as a group; ** octet (symbol 'o'), a group of eight bits; * a set of prefixes to indicate binary multiples of the aforesaid units: ** kibi (symbol 'Ki'), 210 = ; ** mebi (symbol 'Mi'), 220 = ; ** gibi (symbol 'Gi'), 230 = ; ** tebi (symbol 'Ti'), 240 = ; ** pebi (symbol 'Pi'), 250 = ; ** exbi (symbol 'Ei'), 260 = ; * that the first part of the binary prefix is pronounced as the analogous SI prefix, and the second part is pronounced as bee; * that SI prefixes are not used to indicate binary multiples. The bi part of the prefix comes from the word binary, so for example, kibibyte means a kilobinary byte, that is 1024 bytes. Acceptance In 1998, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), one of the organizations that maintain SI, published a brochure stating, among other things, that SI prefixes strictly refer to powers of ten and should not be used to indicate binary multiples, using as an example that 1 kilobit is 1000 bits and not 1024 bits.chapter 3, side note on section 3.1 . The binary prefixes have been adopted by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) as the harmonization document HD 60027-2:2003-03.HD 60027-2:2003 Information about the harmonization document (obtainable on order) Adherence to this standard implies that binary prefixes would be used for powers of two and SI prefixes for powers of ten. This document has been adopted as a European standard.EN 60027-2:2007 Information about the EN standardization process. The IEC binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, ...) are gaining acceptance in open source software and in scientific literature. Elsewhere adoption has been slow, with some operating systems, most notably Windows, continuing to use SI prefixes (kilo, mega, ...) for binary multiples. Supporters of IEEE 1541 emphasize that the standard solves the confusion of units in the market place. Some software (most notably free and open source) uses the decimal SI prefixes and binary prefixes according to the standard.GParted Screenshots of OSS project GParted.

He was first recognized as a zine writer during his mid-teens in 1992. Musical output Detroit's musical career began in the No Wave and Hardcore punk scenes of the mid-1990s in Michigan and the Northwest. His bands included Martha Dumptruck (named after a character from the 1989 film Heathers) and the spoof-metalcore band Miss Thing. In 1997, Aaron performed as the lead vocalist for the San Francisco-based dark-punk band The Little Deaths which featured Mikel Delgado of Cinnamon Imperials and later, Whysol Lane, Scott Bradley of Bumblescrump and, initially, Trixie of Kreviss. His style has been described as \\"informed by feminine sensibilities, balanced by a masculine yelp\\". The Little Deaths became part of the San Francisco Bay-Area's late-1990s musical renaissance which spawned bands such as Subtonix, The Phantom Limbs, Erase Errata, The Vanishing and the 7 Year Bitch offshoot, Clone. The Little Deaths toured and played shows with bands such as The Need, Le Tigre, The Haggard and Imperial Teen extensively until 2000. They released one critically acclaimed album entitled Destination: Sexy on New York‚Äìbased Queercore label Heartcore Records in 1999. The Little Deaths went through several line-up changes before disbanding in 2002. Between 2000 and 2002, Aaron performed several performance art pieces in San Francisco with his short-lived and mostly electronic Dark Wave musical project, Ghost Hips, and with former Little Deaths guitarist Clay Walsh. In 2002, he appeared in the Queer Punk issue of infamous punk publication Maximum RocknRoll. Included was an interview with Cookie Tuff of Subtonix and Aaron, as well as his participation in a round-table style discussion between several queer-identified musicians, including Martin Sorrondeguy of Los Crudos and Limp Wrist, and Gary Fembot and Iraya Robles of Sta-Prest. Between 2002 and 2004, he played synthesizers and sang in Secret Skin (originally called Last Dance), a Rozz Williams-inspired collaboration with Cookie Tuff. They released the track \\"Taped Up and Boxed In\\" on the Cochon Records compilation Nostalgia Del Buio alongside tracks by musical peers, The Vanishing, The Phantom Limbs, and Lost Sounds. The band also recorded an EP, Horrible Prettiness that has yet to be released officially. Now living and working in Los Angeles, CA, Aaron Detroit has since collaborated with Dame Darcy in the Dark Wave band Death By Doll (whose CD entitled Gasoline featuring Detroit was released by Emperor Penguin Recordings on October 31, 2006 ) and toured the USA with the project in the Fall of 2006. Detroit is currently running The Lovers' Will Records & Press, a boutique record label and chapbook press. In April 2010, The Lovers' Will released a deluxe vinyl LP edition of The Ventriloquist by KatieJane Garside's Folk Noir band, Ruby Throat. Zine writing His transgressive style of prose, a mix of fantasy and reality often touching on themes such as power imbalance and frequently death, was found in his long-running Swirlies self-publication and later in Homocore Detroit, a publication for one of the many Homocore chapters active in the early to mid-1990s. Swirlies also included many notable interviews such as 7 Year Bitch and Babes in Toyland. Music writing In 2006, he became a regular contributor to SuicideGirls.com's Newswire as a music editor. His contributions include a notable interview with rock singer Marilyn Manson. His music writing can also be found on the Amoeba Music web site.

He was the chairman/president of the North Melbourne Football Club during the 1970s (1971‚Äì1976) and then again from 2001‚Äì2005. In between, he had been the chairman of the then Victorian Football League (VFL) which is now known as the Australian Football League from 1977 to 1984. Worked as a dentist throughout his entire career until his retirement at 81 years old. Playing career It was as an Australian rules football rover that Aylett first made his mark. Aylett played 220 games and kicked 311 goals in a career spanning 1952‚Äì1964. He won North Melbourne's best and fairest award from 1958‚Äì1960, was All-Australian in 1958 and 1961, won the Tassie Medal in 1958, won the Simpson Medal in 1960, and was captain of his side from 1961‚Äì1964. He was selected in the North Melbourne Football Club's Team of the Century. Aylett also had a brief cricketing career that he never fully pursued due to his interest in Australian rules football. He still played 11 first- class matches in the 1950s for domestic cricket side Victoria as a batsman, but was not successful, finishing with a batting average of just 16. He played district cricket for Carlton (two seasons) and University (six seasons), averaging 27. Administration career Aylett is best known for his career as an administrator in the 1970s and 1980s. He was elected to the position of North Melbourne Football Club president in 1971, and his innovative off-field leadership in securing sponsorship and running corporate entertainment ‚Äì including the rise of the North Melbourne Grand Final Breakfast as one of the Grand Final's most prominent events ‚Äì followed by his aggressive recruitment of star players, particularly through the use of the short-lived \\"ten year rule\\" in 1973, turned North Melbourne from perennial also-rans to a professionally run powerhouse of the 1970s, and the club contested four consecutive Grand Finals between 1975 and 1978, winning two. In 1977, Aylett was elected president of the VFL. He continued his aggressive efforts to push the game's administration towards professional and business-driven success. His actions in setting up the VFL's Night Series in 1977, as a direct rival to the NFL's Night Series, delivered both sponsorship opportunities and laid the platform for the VFL to supersede the NFL for control of football in Australia. Under his guidance, the league expanded into the Sydney market, making preparations for an expansion team before opted to relocate there; Aylett subsequently sat on the Swans' board of directors. Additionally, during his tenure, the VFL began to establish regular Sunday matches in Victoria; and he fought the Melbourne Cricket Club and the Victorian Government to move the Grand Final to VFL Park, ultimately failing to make the move, but securing a better financial deal for the VFL and better ticket access for VFL members. Aylett stepped down in December 1984 following the establishment of the VFL Commission. Aylett also served as president of the National Football League from 1978 until 1985. Aylett signalled the end of his administration career after a final stint as North Melbourne Kangaroos president from 2001‚Äì2005. Honours On 16 June 1979, Aylett was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of services to Australian Rules football. On 24 October 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australian Football. On 1 January 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through the sport of AFL football. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame as an administrator in 2006.

It starred Jason James Richter as Bastian Balthazar Bux, and Jack Black in one of his early roles as the school bully, Slip. This film primarily used the characters from Michael Ende's novel The Neverending Story (1979), but introduced a new storyline. It is an international coproduction between the United States and Germany. The special creature effects were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The film has no connection to the source material of the book beyond the usage of characters from it. Plot In a prologue, the Old Man of Wandering Mountain reads from a large book, begins to record a prophecy of a day when \\"The Nasty\\" will arrive in Fantasia, and describes the savior of \\"Extraordinary Courage\\". Bastian Balthazar Bux has grown older, and his father Barney has married a woman named Jane, and moved into her house in a new neighborhood. Jane's daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become a victim of the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. Bastian arranges for them to be expelled with the help of the janitor after the Nasties trap him in the boiler room. He later flees to the library, where he is surprised to find Carl Conrad Coreander and the Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia, where he is reunited with Falkor, Engywook and Urgl. On Earth, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use it to bombard Fantasia with fireballs and a storm. With wooden Bark Troll, Bastian and his friends head for the Wandering Mountains to speak with the Childlike Empress, who asks Bastian to find the Neverending Story using the Auryn. Falkor, Barky, the gnomes, and Rockbiter's son, Junior, help him, but a \\"wish overload\\" scatters them all across Earth, where Barky ends up in a conifer forest, Falkor saves Junior from falling to his death near Mount Rushmore, and the gnomes arrive in Nome, Alaska. Bastian locates Falkor and Junior, and Falkor flies off to find the others while Junior stays at Bastian's house. Rockbiter sadly informs his wife that Junior is gone, and the Nasties provoke them to quarrel. Nicole takes the Auryn from Bastian's room, discovers its wishing abilities, and takes it on a shopping trip to the local mall. Bark Troll arrives at Bastian's house disguised as a garden plant, while the Gnomes are mailed to him in a box. The reunited group go in search of Nicole, but the Nasties find the Auryn first, whereupon giant crustacean creatures appear in Fantasia to kill the Empress and her advisors. Everyone in the mall turns evil, including Mr. Coreander and Bastian and Nicole‚Äôs parents. Bastian is struck by lightning, and begins to succumb to the wills of the Nasties, but Nicole saves him, and Bastian recovers the Auryn and the book in a fight. The Fantasians return to Fantasia, which is restored to its former magnificence. Bastian and Nicole manage to keep their parents from divorcing, and Junior is reunited with his parents. Nicole and Bastian return to school the next day and find that Bastian has changed Slip and the Nasties into friendly classmates, and Bastian returns the Neverending Story to Mr. Coreander.

Club career Henderson started his career in club football in Australia. He played in the New South Wales Premier League for Sutherland before signing for NSL club Northern Spirit until the club became defunct in 2004. =Bradford City= Henderson then moved to England in July 2004 and had an unsuccessful trial with Blackpool, before signing for Bradford City in August on a one-year contract. He initially came to England for a trial at Ipswich Town and met a goalkeeper coach there, who put him in touch with an agent who brought him to Bradford. Henderson's form later attracted the interest of Nottingham Forest, who sent scouts to assess him. However, a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Milton Keynes Dons convinced the club to think otherwise, while then-manager of Bradford Colin Todd believed Henderson was distracted by the transfer news. Despite impressing during his time at Bradford, Henderson rejected the club's three- year contract renewal offer, instead joining Leicester City on trial on 6 May. =Leicester City= Henderson playing for Leicester City Henderson signed a two-year contract with Leicester City on a free transfer in the summer of 2005. He joined fellow Australians Patrick Kisnorbo, James Wesolowski and then-teammate Danny Tiatto in the squad. Henderson was brought to Leicester as an understudy to Rab Douglas, stating he was \\"willing to fight for his place\\" and that he felt Leicester was a club \\"moving in the right direction\\". After Douglas came under criticism for inconsistent performances, Henderson had a run of matches in the first team under new boss Rob Kelly, making 15 appearances during the 2005‚Äì06 season. At the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Henderson played himself into the first choice position, and despite losing his place for a short term to Conrad Logan he soon regained his spot in the team. Despite conceding 36 goals in 28 league games, Leicester nevertheless survived relegation. With Henderson's contract close to expiring, he attracted the interest of Wigan, Aston Villa and Norwich in the January transfer window. He later allayed any fears of leaving by signing a new two-year contract with Leicester on 16 January. With the loan signings of goalkeepers M√°rton F√ºl√∂p and Ben Alnwick, Henderson spent much of the 2007‚Äì08 season on the substitute's bench. He managed to play a total of 14 league games, conceding 16 goals and making 5 clean sheets as Leicester were relegated at the end of the season. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Henderson's first team place was shared with loan signing David Martin. He started the first game of the season against Milton Keynes Dons, keeping a clean sheet in a 2‚Äì0 victory. On 23 September 2008, he saved two shots from a penalty shoot-out in a Football League Trophy match against Lincoln, with Leicester winning 3‚Äì1 on penalties. However, Henderson conceded two goals in the next round in a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Rotherham United, a match which manager Nigel Pearson described as their worst performance of the season. After a show of poor form from David Martin, Henderson was given a run in the first team in November 2008, but suffered a groin injury that same month in a 2‚Äì1 win at Scunthorpe United, which would turn out to be his last appearance for the club. David Martin suffered an injury himself in February 2009, resulting in the club eventually having to sign three goalkeepers on loan, including David Stockdale and Tony Warner. Nonetheless, he was presented with a medal on 24 April after Leicester had won the League One title. On 28 April, it was reported that manager Nigel Pearson had told Henderson he can leave the following summer alongside fellow Australian Patrick Kisnorbo as the club begin their preparations for their Championship campaign the following season. On 29 May, he was released at the end of his contract by Leicester alongside Marc Edworthy, Patrick Kisnorbo, Bruno N'Gotty and Barry Hayles. =North Queensland Fury= Henderson was signed up by Australian side North Queensland Fury after being released by Leicester City. His form for North Queensland's first season was mixed.http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2009/08/12/70465_sport.html Henderson played an instrumental role when the Fury defeated Gold Coast United 2‚Äì0 on 31 October 2009, after Gold Coast defeated the Fury 5‚Äì0 in their other meeting earlier in the season. The goalkeeping position went back and forth between Henderson and Justin Pasfield throughout the season. =Sydney Olympic= Henderson was signed on a short-term contract at the club. He later returned to Belmore Sports Ground and won the Blues' first NSW Premier League title since their relegation from the National Soccer League in 2011, against Sydney United in front of a 10,000+ crowd (which was estimated as closer to 16,000, as officials had to open the gates and delay the kickoff by almost an hour as they had only printed 10,000 admissions). Henderson won NSWPL Goalkeeper of the Year in 2012 following a superb season between the sticks for the Blues. In late-2012 he committed to the club for seasons 2013 and 2014, potentially seeing him finish his career with Olympic. =Newcastle Jets= Henderson signed on 6 June 2010 a short-term contract with the Newcastle Jets to cover for injured Jets goalkeeper Neil Young for the 2010‚Äì2011 A-League season. =Central Coast Mariners= On 27 August 2010 Henderson signed a six-week contract with the Central Coast Mariners as a temporary replacement for the injured Jess Vanstrattan. His contract was later extended until the end of the season, after which Henderson returned to Sydney Olympic. International career Henderson has never played at international level to date. However, he was placed on standby by an initial draft from the Australia national team on 26 September 2006 for forthcoming matches against Paraguay on 7 October and Bahrain the following Wednesday.

See for instance A transfer of patent or patent application can be the result of a financial transaction, such as an assignment, a merger, a takeover or a demerger, or the result of an operation of law, such as in an inheritance process, or in a bankruptcy. Rationale The rationale behind the transferability of patents and patent applications is that it enables inventors to sell their rights and to let other people manage these intellectual property assets both on the valuation and enforcement fronts. As The Economist put it, :\\"Patents are transferable assets, and by the early 20th century they had made it possible to separate the person who makes an invention from the one who commercialises it. This recognised the fact that someone who is good at coming up with ideas is not necessarily the best person to bring those ideas to market.\\" The Economist, A market for ideas, October 20, 2005. United States In the United States, assignment of a patent is governed by statute. Assignment of an interest occurs only by an \\"instrument in writing\\". The statute also permits recording an assignment with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, but recording is not required except to protect against \\"any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice....\\" Security agreement A security agreement is a conditional transfer of patent ownership when patents are used as collateral for a loan. The borrower will agree to transfer ownership of the patents to the lender if the borrow defaults on the loan.

By 1832, he had become an important figure in the Ottawa Valley timber trade, holding cutting rights along the Gatineau River. Aylen also owned timber limits along the Madawaska River. During the 1830s, Aylen hired Irish labourers left unemployed after the completion of the Rideau Canal in 1832. Known as \\"shiners\\", these workers encountered difficulties competing with the more experienced French- Canadians for jobs in the timber trade. Aylen is said to have been aggressive in competing with other timber owners: cutting wood illegally on their timber limits, destroying their log booms and terrorizing their employees. This started the Shiners' War. Left idle near the end of winter, Aylen's men mounted a campaign of violence in the Lower Town area of Bytown during the late 1830s. In 1836, the Ottawa Lumber Association was created with Aylen a member, which eliminated much of the violence along the rivers. As a result of attempts on the life of James Johnston, who had written to the Lieutenant- Governor complaining about Aylen's activities, armed patrols were set up in Bytown, which put an end to the open violence there. Aylen had leased a large property on the Richmond Road and also owned land in Nepean Township, acquired via marriage. In 1837, he moved across the Ottawa River to Symmes Landing, later Aylmer, in Lower Canada. In 1846, he became a member of the council for Hull Township, later becoming superintendent of roads for Ottawa County and a Justice of the Peace. In the 1850s, he built a sawmill at Chats Falls, later Fitzroy Harbour. He died in Aylmer in 1868.

It is north of Notting Hill and south of Kensal Green and in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The names North Kensington and Ladbroke Grove describe the same area. Despite its namesake, it is not actually part of the larger district of Kensington from which it is separated by Notting Hill town centre. North Kensington is where most of the violence of the Notting Hill race riots of 1958 occurred, and where the Notting Hill Carnival started. Ladbroke Grove tube station was called Notting Hill from its opening in 1864 until 1880, and Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove between then and 1919, when it was renamed Ladbroke Grove (North Kensington). It acquired its current name in 1938. The area was also once served by St. Quintin Park and Wormwood Scrubs railway station, until it closed in 1940. North Kensington was once known for its slum housing, but housing prices have now risen and the area on the whole is considered exclusive and upmarket, although expensive residences are interspersed with lower-income areas like the Lancaster West Estate.  Crossrail  Just to the east of the Old Oak Common site, Kensington and Chelsea Council has been pushing for a station at North Kensington/Kensal off Ladbroke Grove and Canal Way, as a turn-back facility will have to be built in the area anyway. Siting it at Kensal Rise, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Amongst the general public there is a huge amount of support for the project and Mayor Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail's overall cost; in response, Kensington and Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected ¬£33 million cost of a crossrail station, which was received very well by the residents of the borough. TfL is conducting a feasibility study on the station and the project is backed by National Grid, retailers Sainsbury's and Cath Kidston, and Jenny Jones (Green Party member of the London Assembly).Kensal Crossrail station would 'transform' the area, says deputy mayor.

Although vehicles that incorporated the basic principles of the tank (armour, firepower, and all-terrain mobility) had been projected in the decade or so before the War, it was the alarmingly heavy casualties of the start of its trench warfare that stimulated development.Williamson Murray, \\"Armored Warfare: The British, French, and German Experiences,\\" in Research took place in both Great Britain and France, with Germany only belatedly following the Allies' lead. In Great Britain, an initial vehicle, nicknamed Little Willie, was constructed at William Foster & Co., during August and September 1915. The prototype of a new design that became the Mark I tank was demonstrated to the British Army on February 2, 1916. Although initially termed \\"Landships\\" by the Landship Committee, production vehicles were named \\"tanks\\", to preserve secrecy. The term was chosen when it became known that the factory workers at William Foster referred to the first prototype as \\"the tank\\" because of its resemblance to a steel water tank. The French fielded their first tanks in April 1917 and ultimately produced far more tanks than all other countries, combined. The Germans, on the other hand, began development only in response to the appearance of Allied tanks on the battlefield. Whilst the Allies manufactured several thousand tanks during the war, Germany deployed only 20 of its own.Showalter, D.E. \\"More Than Nuts And Bolts: Technology And The German Army, 1870‚Äì1945.\\" Historian 65.1 (Fall 2002): 123‚Äì143. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 February 2012. The first tanks were mechanically unreliable. There were problems that caused considerable attrition rates during combat deployment and transit. The heavily shelled terrain was impassable to conventional vehicles, and only highly mobile tanks such as the Mark IV and FTs performed reasonably well. The Mark I's rhomboid shape, caterpillar tracks, and length meant that it could negotiate obstacles, especially wide trenches, that wheeled vehicles could not. Along with the tank, the first self-propelled gun (the British Gun Carrier Mk I) and the first armoured personnel carrier (the British Mk IX) were constructed in World War I.

With the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the demonstrable power of steam, James Cowan presented a proposal for a Steam Powered Land Ram in 1855, towards the end of the Crimean War. Looking like a helmet on 'footed' Boydell wheels, early forerunners of the Pedrail wheel, it was essentially an armoured steam tractor equipped with cannon and rotating scythes sprouting from the sides. Lord Palmerston is said to have dismissed it as 'barbaric'. Hornsby tractor Holt tractor) were in use in the French Army in 1914-1915. Here, in the Vosges, spring 1915 From 1904 to 1909, David Roberts, the engineer and managing director of Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, built a series of tractors using his patented 'chain-track', which were put through their paces by the British Army, a (small) section of which wanted to evaluate artillery tractors. At one point in 1908, Major William E. Donohue of the Mechanical Transport Committee remarked to Roberts that he should design a new machine with armour that could carry its own gun. However, disheartened by years of ultimately-fruitless tinkering for the Army, Roberts did not take up the idea. In later years, he expressed regret at not having pursued it.The Devil's Chariots: The Birth and Secret Battles of the First Tanks. John Glanfield (Sutton Publishing, 2001) p16 An engineer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Lieutenant Gunther Burstyn, inspired by Holt tractors, designed a tracked armoured vehicle in 1911 carrying a light gun in a rotating turret; equipped also with hinged 'arms', two in front and two at the rear, carrying wheels on the ends to assist with obstacles and trenches, it was a very forward-looking design, if rather small. The Austro-Hungarian government said that it would be interested in evaluating it if Burstyn could secure commercial backing to produce a prototype. Lacking the requisite contacts, he let it drop. An approach to the German government was similarly fruitless. In 1912, Lancelot De Mole, of South Australia, submitted a proposal to the British War Office for a \\"chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches\\". De Mole made more proposals to the War Office in 1914 and 1916, with a culminating proposal in late 1917, accompanied by a huge one-eighth scale model, bur all fell on substantially-deaf ears. De Mole's proposal already had the climbing face, which was so typical of the later World War I British tanks, but it is unknown whether there was some connection. Inquiries to the government of Australia after the war yielded polite responses that Mr. De Mole's ideas had unfortunately been too advanced for the time to be properly recognised at their just value. The Commission on Awards to Inventors in 1919, which adjudicated all the competing claims to the development of the tank, recognised the brilliance of De Mole's design and even considered that it was superior to the machines actually developed, but its narrow remit allowed it only to make a payment of ¬£987 to De Mole to cover his expenses. He noted in 1919 that he was urged by friends before the war to approach the Germans with his design but declined to do so for patriotic reasons. French armored car: the Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902 Before World War I, motorised vehicles were still relatively uncommon, and their use on the battlefield was initially limited, especially of heavier vehicles. Armoured cars soon became more common with most belligerents, especially in more-open terrain. On August 23, 1914, the French Colonel Jean Baptiste Eug√®ne Estienne, later a major proponent of tanks, declared, Messieurs, la victoire appartiendra dans cette guerre √† celui des deux bellig√©rants qui parviendra le premier √† placer un canon de 75 sur une voiture capable de se mouvoir en tout terrain (\\"Gentlemen, victory will belong in this war to the one of the two belligerents that will manage to be the first to succeed in putting a 75 mm cannon on a vehicle that can move on all types of terrain\\"). Armored cars indeed proved useful in open land, such as in deserts, but were not very good at crossing obstacles, such as trenches and barriers, or in more-challenging terrain. The other issue was that it was very hard to add much protection or armament. The main limitation was the wheels, which gave a high ground pressure for the vehicle's weight. That could be solved by adding more wheels, but unless they also were driven, the effect was to reduce traction on the powered wheels. Driving extra wheels meant more drive train weight, which required a larger and heavier engine to maintain performance. Even worse, none of the extra weight was put into an improvement of armour or armament carried, and the vehicles could still not cross very rough terrain. The adoption of caterpillar tracks offered a new solution to the problem. The tracks spread the weight of the vehicles over a much greater area, all of which was for traction to move the vehicle. The limitation on armour and firepower was no longer the ground pressure but the power and weight of the power-plant. Swinton (now Colonel) with Benjamin Holt in Stockton, California, relays gratitude to the inventor for his company's contribution to the war effort. The remaining issue was how to use and configure a vehicle. Major Ernest Dunlop Swinton of the Royal Engineers was the official British war correspondent serving in France in 1914 and recounted in his book Eyewitness how the idea of using caterpillar tracks to drive an armoured fighting vehicle came to him on October 19, 1914 while he was driving through northern France. In July 1914, he had received a letter from a friend, Hugh Marriott, a mining engineer, who drew his attention to a Holt caterpillar tractor that Marriott had seen in Belgium. Marriott thought that it might be useful for transport over difficult ground, and Swinton had passed the information on to the appropriate departments. Swinton then suggested the idea of an armoured tracked vehicle to the military authorities by sending a proposal to Lieutenant-Colonel Maurice Hankey, who tried to interest Lord Kitchener in the idea. When that failed, he sent a memorandum in December to the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which he was himself the secretary. Winston Churchill the First Lord of the Admiralty was one of the members of the committee. Hankey proposed to build a gigantic steel roller pushed by tracked tractors to shield the advancing infantry. Churchill, in turn, wrote a note on January 5 to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and warned that the Germans might any moment introduce a comparable system. A worried Asquith now ordered Kitchener to form a committee, headed by General Scott-Moncrieff, to study the feasibility of Swinton's idea; however, after trials with a Holt 75 horsepower machine, the committee concluded in February 1915 that the idea was impractical. Landship Committee Churchill, however, decided that unless the Army took up the idea, the Navy should proceed independently, even if it exceeded the limits of his authority. He created the Landship Committee in February 1915, initially to investigate designs for a massive troop transporter. As a truer picture of front-line conditions was developed the aims of the investigation changed. A requirement was formulated for an armoured vehicle capable of 4 mph (6 km/h), climbing a 5 feet (1.5 m) high parapet, crossing an 8 feet (2.4 m) wide gap, and armed with machine guns and a light artillery piece. A similar proposal was working its way through the Army GHQ in France, and in June, the Landships Committee was made a joint service venture between the War Office and the Admiralty. The Naval involvement in Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) design had originally come about through the Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Division, the only British unit fielding AFVs in 1914. Surprisingly, until the end of the war, most experimentation on heavy land vehicles was conducted by the Royal Naval Air Service Squadron 20. Russian Tsar Tank At first, protecting heavy gun tractors with armour appeared the most promising line of development. Alternative early 'big wheel' designs on the lines of the Russian tsar tank of 1915 were soon understood to be impractical. However, adapting the existing Holt Company caterpillar designs, the only robust tracked tractors available in 1915 into a fighting machine, which France and Germany did, was decided against. Although armour and weapon systems were easy to acquire, other existing caterpillar and suspension units were too weak, existing engines were underpowered for the vehicles that the designers had in mind and the ability to cross trenches was poor because of the shortness of the wheelbase. The Killen-Strait tractor with three tracks was used for the first experiments in June but was much too small to be developed further. The large Pedrail monotrack vehicle was proposed in a number of different configurations, but non were adopted. Trials to couple two American Bullock tractors failed. There also were considerable differences of opinion between the several committee members. Col R.E.B. Crompton, a veteran military engineer and electrical pioneer, drafted numerous designs with Lucien Legros for armoured troop carrying vehicles and gun-armed vehicles, to have used either Bullock tracks or variants of the Pedrail. At the same time, Lt Robert Macfie, of the RNAS, and Albert Nesfield, an Ealing-based engineer, devised a number of armoured tracked vehicles, which incorporated an angled front 'climbing face' to the tracks. The two men fell out bitterly as their plans came to nought; Macfie in particular pursued a vendetta against the other members of the Landships Committee after the war. Little Willie showing its rear steering wheels To resolve the threatened dissipation of effort, it was ordered in late July that a contract was to be placed with William Foster & Co. Ltd, a company having done some prewar design work on heavy tractors and known to Churchill from an earlier experiment with a trench-crossing supply vehicle, to produce a proof-of-concept vehicle with two tracks, based on a lengthened Bullock tractor chassis. Construction work began three weeks later. Ernest Brooks. Fosters of Lincoln built the 14 ton \\"Little Willie\\", which first ran on 8 September. Powered by a 105 hp (78 kW) Daimler engine, the armoured box was initially fitted with a low Bullock caterpillar. A rotating top turret was planned with a 40 mm gun but abandoned due to weight problems, leaving the final vehicle unarmed and little more than a test-bed for the difficult track system. Difficulties with the commercial tracks supplied led to Tritton designing a completely new track system different from, and vastly more robust than, any other system then in use. The next design by Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson RNAS, a pre-war motor engineer, added a larger track frame to the hull of \\"Little Willie\\". In order to achieve the demanded gap clearance a rhomboidal shape was chosen--stretching the form to improve the track footprint and climbing capacity. To keep a low centre of gravity the rotating turret design was dropped in favour of sponsons on the sides of the hull fitted with naval 6-pounder (57 mm) guns. A final specification was agreed on in late September for trials in early 1916, and the resulting 30 ton \\"Big Willie\\" (later called \\"Mother\\") together with \\"Little Willie\\" underwent trials at Hatfield Park on 29 January and 2 February. Attendees at the second trial included Lord Kitchener, Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna and other political luminaries. On 12 February an initial order for 100 \\"Mother\\" type vehicles was made, later expanded to 150. Crews never called tanks \\"Willies\\"; at first they referred to them as \\"landships\\", and later informally \\"buses\\". Although landship was a natural term coming from an Admiralty committee, it was considered too descriptive and could give away British intentions. The committee, therefore, looked for an appropriate code term for the vehicles. Factory workers assembling the vehicles had been told they were producing \\"mobile water tanks\\" for desert warfare in Mesopotamia. Water Container was therefore considered but rejected because the committee would inevitably be known as the WC Committee (WC meaning water closet was a common British term for a toilet). The term tank, as in water tank, was in December 1915 finally accepted as its official designation. From then on, the term \\"tank\\" was established among British and also German soldiers. While in German Tank specifically refers to the World War I type (as opposed to modern Panzer), in English, Russian and other languages the name even for contemporary armored vehicles is still based on the word tank. A captured British tank in German hands destroying a tree It is sometimes mistakenly stated that, after completion, the tanks were shipped to France in large wooden crates. For secrecy and in order to not arouse any curiosity, the crates and the tanks themselves were then each labeled with a destination in Russian, \\"With Care to Petrograd\\". In fact, the tanks were never shipped in crates: the inscription in Russian was applied on the hull for their transport from the factory to the first training centre at Thetford. The first fifty had been delivered to France on 30 August. They were 'male' or 'female', depending upon whether their armament comprised two 6-pounder cannon and three Hotchkiss machine guns or four Vickers machine guns and one Hotchkiss. It had a crew of eight, four of whom were needed to handle the steering and drive gears. The tanks were capable of, at best, 6 km/h (4 mph), matching the speed of marching infantry with whom they were to be integrated to aid in the destruction of enemy machine guns. In practice, their speed on the broken ground could be as little as 1 mph. After the war the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors decided that the principal inventors of the Tank were Sir William Tritton, managing director of Fosters, and Major Walter Gordon Wilson. Fosters returned to manufacturing Traction engines and steam lorries, but incorporated a small trademark outline image of a tank on the front smokebox door of their postwar road locomotives. During WWII, Tritton and Wilson were called upon to design a Heavy tank, which was known as TOG1, (named for \\"The Old Gang\\"), but this was not a success. However Lincoln City erected a full-size outline Mk 1 as a memorial to the invention of the tank in 2015, and placed it on the Tritton Road roundabout. . First deployments The Schneider CA1, the first French tank The first use of tanks on the battlefield was the use of British Mark I tanks at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with mixed results. Many broke down, but nearly a third succeeded in breaking through. Of the forty-nine tanks shipped to the Somme, only thirty-two were able to begin the first attack in which they were used, and only nine made it across \\"no man's land\\" to the German lines. The tanks had been rushed into combat before the design was mature enough (against the wishes of Churchill and Ernest Swinton)\\"Sensing that tanks would only be effective if they involved an element of surprise, he pressed the government not to use them in small numbers in the Battle of the Somme. As he had put it in a memorandum in 1915, 'None should be used until all can be used at once'. Despite his objections, thirty-five (sic) tanks were used in September 1916, but to very little effect. 'My poor \\"land battleships\\" have been let off prematurely and on a petty scale,' he wrote.\\" Havardi, J. The Greatest Briton: Essays on Winston Churchill's Life and Political Philosophy. Shepheard-Walwyn, 2010. and the number was small but their use gave important feedback on how to design newer tanks, the soundness of the concept and their potential to affect the course of the war. On the other hand, the French Army was critical of the British employment of small numbers of tanks at the battle. It felt the British had sacrificed the secrecy of the weapon but used it in numbers too small to be decisive. Since the British attack was part of an Anglo-French offensive, and the Russians were attacking at the same time, Haig felt justified in making a maximum effort, regardless of the limitations of the tank force. The Mark Is were capable of performing on the real battlefield of World War I, one of the most difficult battlefield terrains in history. Despite their reliability problems, when they worked, they could cross trenches or craters of 9 feet (2.7 m) and drive right through barbed wire. It was still common for them to get stuck, especially in larger bomb craters, but overall, the rhomboid shape allowed for extreme terrain mobility. Splatter mask used by tank crews in World War One Tank crews who had read press reports depicting the new weapon driving through buildings and trees, and crossing wide rivers, were disappointed. Most World War I tanks could travel only at about a walking pace at best. Their steel armour could stop small arms fire and fragments from high-explosive artillery shells. However they were vulnerable to a direct hit from artillery and mortar shells. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; as ventilation was inadequate the atmosphere was heavy with poisonous carbon monoxide from the engine and firing the weapons, fuel and oil vapours from the engine and cordite fumes from the weapons. Temperatures inside could reach 50¬∞C (122¬∞F). Entire crews lost consciousness inside the tanks, or collapsed when again exposed to fresh air.Macpherson WG, Herringham WP, Elliot TR, Balfour A.

Web. 16 Feb 2012 Crews learned how to create and leave behind supply dumps of fuel, motor oil, and tread grease, and converted obsolete models into supply vehicles for newer ones. To counter the danger of bullet splash or fragments knocked off the inside of the hull, the crew wore helmets with goggles and chainmail masks. Fragments were not as dangerous as fire, because of explosive fumes and the large amount of fuel aboard; smoking was prohibited inside and within 20 yards outside tanks. Gas masks were also standard issue, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war due to the use of chemical warfare. The side armour of 8 mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing K bullets. There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed a larger purpose-made anti-tank rifle, the 3.7 cm TAK 1918 anti-tank gun, and also a Geballte Ladung (\\"Bunched Charge\\")‚Äîseveral regular stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion. Engine power was a primary limitation on the tanks; the roughly one hundred horsepower engines gave a power-to-weight ratio of 3.3 hp/ton (2.5 kW/ton). By the end of the 20th century, power-to-weight ratios exceeded 20 hp/ton (15 kW/ton). Many feel that because the British Commander Field Marshal Douglas Haig was himself a horse cavalryman, his command failed to appreciate the value of tanks. In fact, horse cavalry doctrine in World War I was to \\"follow up a breakthrough with harassing attacks in the rear\\", but there were no breakthroughs on the Western Front until the tanks came along. Despite these supposed views of Haig, he made an order for 1,000 tanks shortly after the failure at the Somme and always remained firmly in favour of further production. In 1919, Major General Sir Louis Jackson said: \\"The tank was a freak. The circumstances which called it into existence were exceptional and not likely to recur. If they do, they can be dealt with by other means.\\"Military Blunders, page 152 French developments Renault FT tanks being operated by the US Army in France. Light tanks with a crew of only two, these were mass-produced during World War I. France at the same time developed its own tracked AFVs, but the situation there was very different. In Britain a single committee had coordinated design, and had to overcome the initial resistance of the Army, while the major industries remained passive. Almost all production effort was thus concentrated into the Mark I and its direct successors, all very similar in shape. In France, on the other hand, there were multiple and conflicting lines of development which were badly integrated, resulting in three major and quite disparate production types. A major arms producer, Schneider, took the lead in January 1915 and tried to build a first armoured vehicle based on the Baby Holt tractor but initially the development process was slow until in July they received political, even presidential, support by combining their project with that of a mechanical wire cutter devised by engineer and politician Jean-Louis Br√©ton. In December 1915, the influential Colonel Estienne made the Supreme Command very enthusiastic about the idea of creating an armoured force based on these vehicles; strong Army support for tanks was a constant during the decades that followed. Already in January and February 1916 quite substantial orders were made, at that moment with a total number of 800 much larger than the British ones. French Saint-Chamond tanks had long bodies with a lot of the vehicle projecting forward off of the short caterpillar tracks, making them more liable to get ditched in trenches. Army enthusiasm and haste had its immediate drawbacks however. As a result of the involvement of inexperienced army officers ordered to devise a new tank based on the larger 75 hp Holt chassis in a very short period of time, the first French tanks were poorly designed with respect to the need to cross trenches and did not take the sponson-mounting route of the British tanks. The first, the Char Schneider CA equipped with a short 75 mm howitzer, had poor mobility due to a short track length combined with a hull that overhung front and rear. It was unreliable as well; a maximum of only about 130 of the 400 built were ever operational at the same time. Then industrial rivalry began to play a detrimental role: it created the heavy Char St Chamond, a parallel development not ordered by the Army but approved by government through industrial lobby, which mounted much more impressive weaponry ‚Äî its 75 mm was the most powerful gun fielded by any operational tank up till 1941 ‚Äî but also combined many of the Schneider CA's faults with an even larger overhanging body. Its innovative petro-electrical transmission, while allowing for easy steering, was insufficiently developed and led to a large number of breakdowns. The Renault FT, the first \\"modern\\" tank But industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, in 1916 designed the first practical light tanks, a class largely neglected by the British. It was Renault's excellent small tank design, the FT, incorporating a proper climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full 360¬∞ traverse capability. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly 'modern' tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \\"box tanks\\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. (A very similar Peugeot prototype, with a fixed casemate mounting a short 75mm cannon, was trialled in 1918 but the idea was not pursued). The FT had the largest production run of any tank of the war, with over 3700 built, more numerous than all British tanks combined. That this would happen was at first far from certain; some in the French army lobbied for the alternative mass production of super-heavy tanks. Much design effort was put in this line of development resulting in the gigantic Char 2C, the most complex and technologically advanced tank of its day. Its very complexity ensured it being produced too late to participate in World War I and in the very small number of just ten, but it was the first tank with a three-man turret; the heaviest to enter service until late in World War II and still the largest ever operational. French production at first lagged behind the British. After August 1916 however, British tank manufacture was temporarily halted to wait for better designs, allowing the French to overtake their allies in numbers. When the French used tanks for the first time on 16 April 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, they had four times more tanks available. But that did not last long as the offensive was a major failure; the Schneiders were badly deployed and suffered 50% losses from German long-range artillery. The Saint-Chamond tanks, first deployed on 5 May, proved to be so badly designed that they were unable to cross the first line of German trenches. German developments Germany concentrated more on the development of anti-tank weapons than on development of tanks themselves. They only developed one type of tank which saw combat in the war. The A7V Sturmpanzerwagen was designed in 1917 and was used in battle from March 1918. It was manned by a crew of 18, and had eight machine guns and a 57-millimetre cannon. Only 20 A7Vs were produced during the war. The Germans did, however, capture Allied tanks and re-purpose them for their own uses. Battle of Cambrai British-operated FT tank attached to Canadian troops The first battle in which tanks made a great impact was the Battle of Cambrai in 1917. British Colonel J.F.C. Fuller, chief of staff of the Tank Corps, was responsible for the tanks' role in the battle. They made an unprecedented breakthrough but, as ever on the Western front, the opportunity was not exploited. Ironically, it was the soon-to-be-supplanted horse cavalry that had been assigned the task of following up the motorised tank attack.A.J. Smithers, Cambrai: The First Great Tank Battle (2014) Tanks became more effective as the lesson of the early tanks was absorbed. The British produced the Mark IV in 1917. Similar to the early Marks in appearance, its construction was considered to produce a more reliable machine, the long- barrelled naval guns were shortened (the barrels of the earlier, longer guns were prone to digging in the mud when negotiating obstacles) and armour was increased just enough to defeat the standard German armour-piercing bullet. The continued need for four men to drive the tank was solved with the Mark V which used Wilson's epicyclic gearing in 1918. Also in 1918 the French produced the Renault FT, the result of a co-operation between Estienne and Louis Renault. As mentioned before, it had the innovative turret position, and was operated by two men. At just 8 tons it was half the weight of the Medium A Whippet but the version with the cannon had more firepower. It was conceived for mass production, and the FT became the most produced tank of World War I by a wide margin, with over 3,000 delivered to the French Army. Large numbers were used by the Americans and several were also lent to the British. In July 1918, the French used 480 tanks (mostly FTs) at the Battle of Soissons, and there were even larger assaults planned for the next year. In Plan 1919, the Entente hoped to commit over 30,000 tanks to battle in that year. Whippet Tank Whippet Finally, in a preview of later developments, the British developed the Whippet. This tank was specifically designed to exploit breaches in the enemy front with its relatively higher speed (around 8 mph vs 3-4 mph for the British heavy tanks). The Whippet was faster than most other tanks, although it carried only machine gun armament, meaning it was not suited to combat with armoured vehicles but instead with infantry. Postwar tank designs reflected this trend towards greater tactical mobility. Villers-Bretonneux: Tank against tank Roye on March 21, 1918. The German General Staff did not have enthusiasm for tanks, but allowed the development of anti-tank weapons. Regardless, development of a German tank was under way. The only project to be produced and fielded was the A7V, although only twenty were built. The majority of the fifty or so tanks fielded by Germany were captured British vehicles. A7Vs were captured by the Allies, but they were not used, and most ended up being scrapped. The first tank-versus-tank battles took place 24 April 1918. It was an unexpected engagement between three German A7Vs and three British Mk. IVs at Villers-Bretonneux. Fuller's Plan 1919, involving massive use of tanks for an offensive, was never used because the blockade of Germany and the entry of the US brought an end to the war.

Bechstein Pianoforte AG (also known as Bechstein, ) is a German manufacturer of pianos, established in 1853 by Carl Bechstein. History Carl Bechstein =Before Bechstein= Young Carl Bechstein studied and worked in France and England as a piano craftsman, before he became an independent piano maker. His first pianos were made for other companies. =C. Bechstein= C. Bechstein piano factory was founded on 1 October 1853 by Carl Bechstein in Berlin, Germany. Carl Bechstein set out to manufacture a piano able to withstand the great demands imposed on the instrument by the virtuosi of the time, such as Franz Liszt. In 1857, Hans von B√ºlow (Liszt's son-in-law) gave the first public performance on a Bechstein grand piano by performing Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor in Berlin. By 1870, with endorsements from Franz Liszt and Hans von B√ºlow, Bechstein pianos had become a staple in many concert halls and private mansions. By that time three piano makers, all of which were founded in 1853, became established as the industry leaders across the world: Bechstein, Bl√ºthner and Steinway & Sons. In 1881, Bechstein began supplying pianos to Queen Victoria. A gilded art-case piano was delivered to Buckingham Palace, followed by several more Bechstein pianos to Windsor Castle and other royal residences.Liste von Empf√§ngern Bechsteinscher Fl√ºgel finden sich Majest√§ten und F√ºrstlichkeiten aus vielen L√§ndern: insgesamt 62 Pers√∂nlichkeiten aus Deutschland (darunter auch der Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg- Gotha, der Heimat Bechsteins), Englang, Ru√üland und Schweden. In London, Paris und St. Petersburg entstanden Auslieferungszentren, in London gab es -wie in Berlin-sogar einen Bechstein-Konzertsaal (Bechstein-Hall, heute Wigmore-Hall). Lieferungen erfolgten in insgesamt 153 inner- und au√üereurop√§ische L√§nder und St√§dte; Bechstein durfte sich Hoflieferant f√ºr 16 Herrscherh√§user in Deutschland, England, Italien, Spanien, Rum√§nien, Schweden und Norwegen nennen. Bernd R√ºhle: Carl Bechstein (1826-1900) √úber Leben und Lebenswerk eines grossen Klavierbauers... By January 1886 they were among the piano manufacturers holding a Royal Warrant as a supplier to the Queen. Several British embassies across the world acquired Bechstein pianos. In 1885, Bechstein opened a branch in London, that eventually grew to become the largest showroom and dealership in Europe. In 1889 he moved to 40 Wigmore Street, taking over the property of H.J. Cave & Sons By 1890, showrooms opened in Paris, Vienna, and Saint Petersburg. On 31 May 1901, Bechstein Hall, built at a cost of ¬£100,000, opened next to the company's London showroom at 36-40 Wigmore Street. Between 1901 and 1914, C. Bechstein was the largest piano dealership in London. At that time, Bechstein was patronized by the tsars of Russia, the royal families of Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Austria and Denmark, and other royalty and aristocracy. The list of royal clients of Bechstein may be found on the soundboard of vintage Bechstein pianos made before the Second World War. The list is part of the original Bechstein trademark logo; it can be seen under the strings in the centre of a piano's soundboard. The signature of Carl Bechstein The years from the 1870s through 1914 brought Bechstein their most dramatic increase in sales. In 1880 a second Bechstein factory was opened in Berlin, and the third factory opened in 1897 in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Production reached 3,700 pianos annually in 1900, and 4,600 in 1910, making Bechstein the largest German manufacturer of high- end pianos. At that time, about three quarters of production went to international markets, especially Britain and the Commonwealth, and Russia. Carl Bechstein died in 1900, and the Bechstein company continued to operate under the management of his sons. Bechstein Art Nouveau grand piano, 1902 Between 1900 and 1914 C. Bechstein was one of the leading piano makers in the world, employing 1,200 craftsmen and workers by 1913 and making five thousand pianos per year. =First World War= C. Bechstein suffered huge property losses in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg during World War I. The largest loss was in London. Although the company's position in the United Kingdom was initially unaffected, with the company still listed as holding a Royal Warrant in January 1915, Warrants to both King George V, and his wife Queen Mary were cancelled on 13 April 1915. Bechstein was not the only musical concern to be affected by growing anti-German sentiment: there were earlier attempts, led by William Boosey, the managing director of Chappell & Co., to boycott German music altogether. In 1915 Sir Edgar Speyer - despite being a Baronet and Privy Counsellor who was then funding the Proms - was forced to leave the country. Following the passing of the Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act 1916 the British arm of the company was wound-up on 5 June 1916, all Bechstein property, including the concert hall and showrooms full of pianos, were seized as \\"enemy property\\" and closed. In 1916 the hall was sold as alien property at auction to Debenhams for ¬£56,500. It was renamed Wigmore Hall, and then re- opened under the new name in 1917. All 137 Bechstein pianos at the Bechstein showrooms were confiscated too, and became property of the new owner of the Hall. After a dispute with his brother, Edwin Bechstein left the company and was paid off. =Between the wars= A 1920 C. Bechstein advertisement poster Eventually the Bechstein factory resumed full-scale production during the 1920s. At that time, technical innovations and inventions of new materials and tools, as well as improvements in piano design and construction, had allowed Bechstein to become one of the leading piano makers again. The most successful models were the updated \\"A\\"-185 and \\"B\\"-208 grand pianos. The upright pianos became more popular after the war, and C. Bechstein were successful with its upright pianos Model-8 and Model-9, both of which have been considered the finest upright pianos. The company became a joint-stock company 1923, allowing Edwin Bechstein and his wife Helene, to re-purchase part of the company as shareholders. In London a small number of budget-quality baby grand pianos 4'8\\" in size were built and marketed. They are cast \\"Bechstein London\\" on the frame and C.Bechstein on the fall board. In 1930, the company collaborated with German electrical goods manufacturer Siemens under Nobel laureate Walther Nernst to produce one of the first electric pianos, the \\"Neo-Bechstein\\" or \\"Siemens-Bechstein\\" electric grand, using electromagnetic pickups. Edwin Bechstein and his wife, Helene Bechstein, who was an ardent admirer of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, bestowed many gifts on Hitler including his first luxury car, a red Mercedes costing 26,000 marks. Helene Bechstein and her friend Elsa Bruckmann introduced Hitler to Germany's cultural elite in Berlin and Munich. \\"I wish he were my son,\\" she said. After Edwin Bechstein died in 1934 in Berchtesgaden, where he had a villa named \\"Bechstein\\" in a short distance to the Obersalzberg, his body was transferred to Berlin. He was buried following a state funeral attended by Adolf Hitler and NSDAP politicians, including Wilhelm Frick and Max Amann. =Second World War= In 1945, allied bombing raids destroyed the Bechstein piano factory in Berlin, along with the firm's stores of valuable wood, including the precious Alpine spruce used to make soundboards. The war also cost the company many of its experienced craftsmen. For several years after the war, Bechstein could not resume full-scale production of pianos and made only a few pianos per year. =After World War II= After de-Nazification of the C. Bechstein Company, it began to produce pianos again in 1948. C. Bechstein eventually increased piano production to about a thousand pianos per year during the 1950s and 1960s. However, the new economic situation in the post-war world was hard for the piano business. In 1961, the Bechstein piano factory was affected by the construction of the Berlin Wall. The ownership of C. Bechstein had changed several times. In 1963, all the shares were sold to the Baldwin Piano Company. Until the reunification of Germany, the company was making fewer pianos, although the quality of craftsmanship remained high. In 1953, the centennial of Bechstein was celebrated by the Berlin Philharmonic under Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Wilhelm Backhaus. Many entertainers and concert pianists, such as Leonard Bernstein, Jorge Bolet, and Wilhelm Kempff, favoured Bechstein pianos. The State Ministry of Culture of the Soviet Union made a contract to supply major state philharmonic orchestras and concert halls across the USSR with three brands of pianos - Steinway & Sons, Bl√ºthner, and Bechstein. Bl√ºthner and Bechstein were also made the staple practice pianos at the Leningrad Conservatory and Moscow Conservatory, while most other music schools of the USSR were limited mainly to the Soviet-made pianos. Concert pianists, such as Dinu Lipatti, Shura Cherkassky, Tatiana Nikolayeva, Vladimir Sofronitsky, and Sviatoslav Richter, among others, often chose Bechstein pianos for their studio recordings. =After the fall of the Berlin Wall= In 1986, Karl Schulze, German entrepreneur and master piano maker, bought Bechstein and continued the legacy of fine piano making. Due to reunification of Germany and elimination of the Berlin Wall, the land formerly belonging to the Bechstein factory was used for new construction in the capital. In 1992 Bechstein started a new factory in Saxony for C. Bechstein and Zimmermann instruments. The manufacturing of Zimmermann instruments in Seifhennersdorf discontinued at the end of 2011. In 1996, C. Bechstein went public. In 2003, Bechstein formed a partnership with Samick, in order to improve overseas distribution. Today, after the successful capital increase in 2009, Samick no longer has any shares. Nowadays major shareholders are Arnold Kuthe Beteiligungs GmbH as well as Karl Schulze and his wife Berenice K√ºpper, all Berlin investor. By 2006, the company opened eight upscale showrooms and increased the number of Bechstein dealerships in major cities across Europe, North America and Asia. New Bechstein centres were opened in recent years in New York, Moscow, Shanghai as well as partner centres in Kiev, Seoul, Sydney, and the Netherlands. In 2007, the new C. Bechstein Europe factory opened in Hradec Kr√°lov√©, Czech Republic. Bechstein has invested millions of Euros to build up a new manufacturing site especially for W. Hoffmann instruments. All brands and instruments made by C. Bechstein now exclusively originate from Europe. Along with the company's economic success, C. Bechstein's concert grand pianos are making their comeback on international concert stages and in recording studios. In 2006, the first international C. Bechstein Piano Competition took place under Vladimir Ashkenazy's patronage. National C. Bechstein competitions regularly foster the musical development of young artists. As of 1 January 2017, the group is headed up by new management: Stefan Freymuth has taken over as CEO of C. Bechstein Pianoforte AG, replacing Karl Schulze who had led the group since 1986 and will stay on to advise the new CEO as general representative. =Artcase pianos= Bechstein has been known as a maker of one-of-a-kind artcase pianos since the 19th century. Artcase pianos were commissioned by interior designers for royal palaces and mansions. Artists and craftsmen were hired by C. Bechstein to make special pianos decorated with gold, hand-carved details, and hand-painted art on the piano case. Some of the artcase Bechsteins are now museum pieces, while others are sometimes traded at musical-instrument auctions, mainly in London and New York. Composers Four musicians who composed on Bechstein pianos: Edvard Grieg, Alexander Scriabin, Maurice Ravel, B√©la Bart√≥k. C. Bechstein: The Legend Lives on Text by Norbert Ely, revised by Bechstein English version: √úMS Berlin ¬© 82012 C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik AG Kantstrasse 17  10623 Berlin  Germany www.bechstein.com Performers Students and followers of Hans von B√ºlow and Franz Liszt also developed loyalty to Bechstein pianos. Alexander Scriabin owned a concert-size Bechstein at his Moscow home, which is now a national museum, and Scriabin's piano is still played at scheduled recitals. Tatiana Nikolayeva preferred the Bechstein for her acclaimed recordings of the music of Bach. Sviatoslav Richter grew up studying piano on a Bechstein and remembered his experience with that piano as stimulating and rewarding. Claude Debussy said \\"Piano music should only be written for the Bechstein\\". Edwin Fischer chose a Bechstein piano for his pioneering recording of Bach's The Well Tempered Clavier, as did Artur Schnabel for his cycle of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas. Both artists were very fond of Bechstein pianos, as were many of the 20th century's leading pianists, such as Wilhelm Kempff, Wilhelm Backhaus, Walter Gieseking and Jorge Bolet. Polish pianist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman (famous thanks to the movie The Pianist) used a Bechstein piano until 1941 in his family private apartments in Warsaw. For his studio recording of the music of Chopin and Beethoven, Dinu Lipatti used a Bechstein piano. Bob Dylan played a Bechstein piano at the ABC Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland on 20 May 1966. He is mentioned on many Bechstein dealers' web pages as a regular Bechstein player. When Dave Stewart of The Eurythmics listed his Bechstein piano for auction, he named Bob Dylan as one of the musicians who had played the piano. The Bechstein concert grand at London's Trident Studios, over a century old and much sought-after for its sound, became one of the most frequently recorded instruments in rock history. The piano can be heard on The Beatles' \\"Hey Jude,\\" Elton John's \\"Your Song,\\" George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" David Bowie's \\"Life on Mars?,\\" Lou Reed's \\"Perfect Day,\\" Queen's \\"Seven Seas of Rhye,\\" Carly Simon's \\"You're So Vain,\\" Nilsson's \\"Without You,\\" and Supertramp's \\"Crime of the Century\\". It saw service in the studio from 1968 until the mid 1980s, and has since been sold at auction. Freddie Mercury of the British rock band Queen played a Bechstein piano on the best-selling album A Night at the Opera. (The liner notes to the album, as reprinted in the 2005 deluxe CD/DVD release of the album, credit Freddie Mercury with \\"Bechstein Debauchery\\".) The music video for Elton John's \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\" features John playing a white Bechstein grand. Oscar Peterson played and owned a Bechstein throughout much of his career, publicity contracts with rival manufacturers notwithstanding. Anna Ivanova (2011) played Liszt's personal 1880 Bechstein grand piano, which is displayed in the Liszt Haus in Weimar (Germany). Recordings of her playing both this grand piano, and the Bechstein 576 (which was delivered 17 March 1862 to Franz Liszt), which presently is being displayed at the Bechstein Centre in Berlin, can be found on YouTube. Awards *In 1862, C. Bechstein was awarded gold medals at the London International Exhibition. *In 2007, C. Bechstein received the iF Gold Award for C. Bechstein Piano Model Millennium. Today Bechstein is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Major shareholders are Karl Schulze and his wife Berenice K√ºpper as well as another private investor. In 2010 C. Bechstein opened a representative office in Shanghai, China. See also * Florian Essenfelder, piano maker References Further reading * Hagen W.

U.S. planners envisioned two federal armies converging simultaneously, one force under the command of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks pressing northward up the Red River commencing at Alexandria, Louisiana and the other federal army under the command of Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele driving southwestward from Little Rock, Arkansas. The objective was to press the rebel army of Gen. E. Kirby Smith back upon the rebel stronghold at Shreveport and defeat him. If successful, a somewhat vague second phase envisioned the two federal armies combining into one large force and continuing their offensive with a westward push into Texas. Background Prairie D'√Çne‚ÄîFrench for \\"Donkey Meadow\\"‚Äîwas a prominent topographical feature in southwest Arkansas consisting of an open prairie 20 miles square, surrounded on all sides primarily by dense pine forest. In 1864 it was a well- known landmark some one hundred miles southwest of Little Rock. The prairie was a crossroads; to the west lay Washington, the Confederate capital of Arkansas since their abandonment of Little Rock in September 1863. To the east of the prairie lay the heavily fortified city of Camden, where many Confederate troops were headquartered. To the south of Prairie D'Ane lay the strategic Red River, with Shreveport, Louisiana beyond. The US Army Captured Little Rock on 10 September 1863. As Union forces marched into the city, the Confederates hastily gathered up their official state documents and moved their seat of government to Washington. In their retreat to the southwest, the Confederates constructed defensive works at several points along the old military road running from Benton to Arkadelphia. As they built extensive earthen and log breastworks at the northern edge of Prairie D'Ane, it was . A Confederate defeat on the prairie would lay open the route to Washington for the federal army. But Prairie D'Ane posed a difficult defensive problem for the rebels. On the one hand, its wide open plain offered good fields of fire for defending artillery batteries; on the other hand, the same open country offered an attacking force plenty of space in which to maneuver and outflank the defenders in their fixed entrenchments. Most of the heavy rebel defensive barriers erected along the route from Little Rock to Prairie D'Ane had been built by slave labor. Roving groups of rebel guerrilla cavalry meanwhile were dispatched to harass federal forces along their line of march from Little Rock. Prelude Defending Confederate forces engaged in the battle were under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Sterling Price and consisted primarily of Arkansas and Missouri Confederate mounted regiments, and some Arkansas State Troops comprising three cavalry divisions commanded by General James Fagan, General John Marmaduke and General Samuel Maxey. The three divisions of infantry and dismounted cavalry commanded by Generals John Walker, Thomas Churchill and Mosby Parsons, and their supporting artillery had been dispatched by Genl. Kirby Smith to Louisiana in opposing Union Maj. Gen. Banks thrust up the Red River toward Shreveport. Many of the Arkansas state troops were conscripts, some of whom had served in previous campaigns, had deserted the ranks, and were re-drafted by Confederate press gangs. Attacking U.S. forces comprised the Seventh Army Corps (augmented) under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele and consisting of two infantry divisions commanded by Generals Frederick Salomon and John Thayer and a cavalry division under the command of General Eugene Carr, and supported by five artillery batteries. Most of the attacking forces were troops from Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas and Kansas‚Äîthe latter including two recently raised regiments of United States Colored Troops (authorized in 1863). Almost every regiment of the VII Corps was seriously under strength, due to sickness and disability caused by Typhoid fever, measles, malaria (known as \\"Southern Fever\\"), influenza, chronic diarrhea, viruses of unknown origin, and chronic painful rheumatism caused by the damp and humid conditions encountered by the northern soldiers serving in the Arkansas Delta country around Helena from 1862 to 1863. At one point in the US Army's Arkansas campaign, one division had some 1000 soldiers on the sick list. Death by disease was far more common for federal soldiers serving in the Arkansas theater than death by combat(and for all soldiers on both sides). Battle Following a crossing of the Little Missouri River by elements of the 1st Iowa Cavalry, the 36th Iowa Infantry and 43rd Indiana Infantry followed on the evening of April 2. The cavalry established a picket line well forward up the road egressing from the ford some 1 1/4 miles south of the river in the densely timbered bottom land, They blocked the road at a point overlooking an old orchard. The infantry following them across were ordered into hasty bivouac with the 36th Iowa moving just upstream of the ford and the 43rd Indiana sliding just to the south of it. The hour was late and the troops were ordered to lay on their arms and to expect a dawn attack. From their camps at the river, the federal infantry could hear some exchanges of fire to their front between the 1st Iowa cavalry and rebel guards monitoring that crossing. The federals were surprised when no attack came at dawn on the 3rd, a Sunday. It was so quiet that the infantry regiments sent out foraging parties to look for whatever meat could be found. At around 1 p.m. three companies of the 43rd Indiana went forward toward the cavalry picket line, were spotted by the Confederates and some skirmishing occurred. Three companies of the 36th Iowa‚ÄîA, D and G-- commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel F.M. Drake rushed up to assist the Indiana companies, only to return to their bivouac, and then be rushed forward for a second round of skirmishing late in the day. The federals held the ford and the road south for more than a mile. The small rebel detachment guarding the ford was being steadily reinforced by two brigades of General John Marmaduke's division, one commanded by William Cabell and one under Colton Green. Some of these troops had marched all the way downriver from Antoine‚Äîwhere Steele had been expected to cross‚Äîand it was some time before Marmaduke himself arrived opposite the ford. At daylight on April 4, Greene's and Cabell's brigades, some 12,000 strong, assaulted the picket line. Drake was sent forward again with the same three companies of the 36th Iowa and also took three companies of the 43rd Indiana, companies E, H and C. As they advanced they could see the troopers of the 1st Iowa cavalry trying to hold their position. Drake formed a battle line of his own just to their rear with his six companies of infantry. Companies D, G and A of the 36th deployed to the right of the road, and companies E, H and C of the 43rd Indiana deployed to the left flank on the other side of the road. The very dense timber provided excellent cover and concealment for the Union infantrymen. Drake meanwhile summoned a 2-gun section of Lieutenant Charles Peetz' 2nd Missouri Artillery to cross the ford and stand by for action on the road. Elsewhere, Colonel Charles Kittredge with the remaining 7 companies of the 36th Iowa remained in reserve at the river bank. Drake ordered the 1st Iowa troopers to send their mounts to the rear and to fall back and get in line with the infantry, which order was promptly carried out. In order to get at Drakes command positioned in the timber, the Confederates had to advance across an old orchard and doing so in line of battle they made easy targets for the federal infantry. Drake's entire forward command consisted of less than 400 men but they doggedly resisted the rebel incursion, repulsing two flanking maneuvers by Marmaduke early in the fight. Although McLean, the federal brigade commander, ordered a general retreat to the river bank, and while Kittredge withdrew his reserve companies, Drake thought the order inadvisable and told his six companies of infantry to \\"Stand Fast.\\" Over the next two hours the federals were driven back farther and farther toward the river, and Marmaduke brought up an artillery battery and raked the woods with grape shot to try to dislodge Drake. At around 10:30 a.m. Marmaduke sent a third flanking force well to the left flank of the three companies of the 43rd Indiana, which began to disintegrate. As the Hoosiers ran to the rear they crossed an open field and were scattered. Seeing the companies of the 43rd starting to give way, Col. Kittredge got the 7 remaining companies of the 36th Iowa (B, C, E, F, H, I, and K) into line of battle and advanced them until they reached the edge of the field. There, Kittredge placed his right flank next to Peetz's battery and ordered his regiment to lie down behind a slight ridge in the field. Kittedge correctly assumed the rebels would charge across the field in an effort to capture Peetz's guns, When the rebels subsequently did just that, Kittredge ordered his men to stand up and fire, which they did in volleys, by company. The 36th Iowa had just been issued new Springfield .58 caliber rifled muskets before departing Little Rock and in this action they used them to deadly effect. This heavy federal musketry broke the back of Marmaduke's flank attack, repulsing the rebels with serious losses that included the capture of Rebel Lieutenant Fackler, Marmaduke's aid-de-camp. By this time, Brigadier General Samuel Rice arrived on the north shore of the Little Missouri river with his entire 1st Brigade and more artillery. Seeing this, Marmaduke concluded that he had insufficient numbers to stop the federals from crossing Elkins'Ferry. He withdrew Cabell's and Greene's brigades and marched southward toward Prairie D'Ane to join the main rebel army under Sterling Price. The next day, the remainder of Steele's corps crossed the Little Missouri on a pontoon bridge. Augmented two days later by the arrival from Fort Smith of Brigadier General John M. Thayer's Frontier Division, they encamped a few days on the south side of the ford before marching south through the Little Missouri bottom toward the prairie. While Steele rested for a few days at the plantation home of the widow Cornelius, he obtained valuable intelligence from wounded and dying Confederates being treated there about the strength of the Confederate units in front of him. Reconnoitering from there, Federals observed the extensive log and earth breastworks along the northern edge of the prairie. Marching south from Cornelius plantation on 10 April, they encountered the line of battle and attacked with artillery, cavalry and infantry skirmishers, eventually driving the line back about a mile before being checked by the Confederates. Skirmishing continued throughout the afternoon of 11 April. In a delaying action, the Confederates fell back, with the intention of mounting a stand further south to defend their capital at Washington, where they expected to receive reinforcements from Kirby Smith at Shreveport. The Union's VII Corps had transported inadequate provisions; finding little provender along the way, the men had to march from Little Rock on half-rations. They needed both animal forage and food for the soldiers. Steele's intelligence reports began to relay rumors that the Union forces under Banks that were converging on Shreveport had been repelled by Kirby Smith. Steele had doubted the wisdom of marching into southwest Arkansas to support what he thought was Banks' ill-conceived Red River Campaign. He had delayed leaving Little Rock until receiving a rather blunt direct order from General Ulysses S. Grant, a former West Point classmate. Now, deep in enemy territory with his forces reduced to quarter rations, with little forage for his mules and horses, and struggling with muddy, rain-saturated roads, Steele grew increasingly doubtful of his ability to reach Shreveport. A resupply train had started from Little Rock to support Steele on 12 April, but those conditions meant it would probably be delayed in arriving. Additionally, if the rumors of Banks' defeat proved true, Steele knew Kirby Smith would be freed to make an about-face and turn his army northward to repel Steele with overwhelming force. Taking the counsel of his officers, Steele decided to divert his army east to take Camden, Arkansas where they hoped to capture provisions and await intelligence that would confirm or deny the rumors of Banks' defeat. In a diversionary move, Steele ordered Thayer's Frontier Division to make a feint toward Washington, thereby drawing the enemy into a fight south of the prairie. The main part of his Union force rapidly diverted eastward on the Camden Road. Thayer's action was quickly discovered, however, enticing the Confederates into a rear guard action at the hamlet of Moscow, on the southeast edge of the prairie. Steele's main force, meanwhile, proceeded into Camden and seized the city with minimal opposition. But they found meager supplies and learned that Banks had been defeated at the Red River. After suffering the loss of nearly 500 supply wagons and 1200 mules in bitter and ferocious ambushes upon Union supply trains at Poison Springs on 18 April, and Marks Mills on 25 April, Steele decided to retreat from south Arkansas in order to save his army. Steele's VII Corps moved north from Camden on the early morning of 27 April. Steele was pursued by the Confederates all the way to the Saline River, south of Little Rock. The campaign ended with the Battle of Jenkins Ferry on 29‚Äì30 April 1864. Aftermath The site of the battle, the Battle of Prairie D' Ane Historic Site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is part of the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark.

Synopsis The story shows how British officer and colonial administrator William Savage comes to know about the thuggee cult, infiltrates their society, learns their ways and code of communication, and destroys them by capturing or killing their key leaders. During his travels with the thuggee, he almost falls prey to the cult's ways as he comes to experience the ecstasy of ritual killings. The story shows how complex the web was in terms of type and stature of people involved with the thuggee cult. Analysis The Deceivers portrays the thuggee cult and corruption during Company rule in India. Historically, the East India Company was the world's first joint-stock company ‚Äî chartered by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1601. The main character, William Savage, is an official of the East India Company and tax collector (or, as he would rather view himself, colonial administrator) of the fictional district of \\"Madhia\\". He is deeply committed to his duties, which he considers to lie with the people of his district, rather than tax extraction for the East India Company. He is fluent in four dialects and has a highly developed sense of honour. At the beginning of the story, he marries his fianc√©e Sarah Wilson, the daughter of Colonel Wilson and 20 years his junior. In the course of the story, he discovers a mass grave, filled with the remains of travellers, all of whom were evidently strangled to death in ritualistic fashion, among them a recently killed British officer. This leads him to begin an investigation, in the course of which he arrests Hussein, who confesses to being a thug, or deceiver. Colonel Wilson arrives and is furious at the measures that Savage has taken to find the ones responsible for the mass murders. He refuses to believe Savage's story of the thuggee cult, blaming the murders on dacoits (bandits) instead. Savage then decides to become a thug and infiltrates their society with Hussein's help. His character is loosely based on William Sleeman, who historically started an extensive campaign involving profiling, intelligence, and executions.  Relations with other books in the series  William is the father of Rodney Savage, the protagonist in Nightrunners of Bengal, set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Together with Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg, John III was the lord ruling in guardianship the Danish Duchy of Schleswig 1332‚Äì1340. He was known as ‚ÄúJohn the Mild‚Äù. Life He was the son of Count Gerhard II the Blind of Holstein- Pl√∂n and of the Danish Queen Dowager Agnes of Brandenburg, a fact that made him a maternal half-brother of Eric VI and Christopher II. In 1312 John and his paternal half-brother Gerhard IV succeeded their father as co-ruling counts of Holstein-Pl√∂n. In 1316 John III inherited Holstein-Kiel from his father's cousin John II the One-Eyed and thus left Holstein-Pl√∂n for his brother Gerhard IV as sole ruler. A wealthy man by inheritance John very early acted as a powerful local prince funding Danish warfare and co-operating with his first cousin Gerhard III. His financial support of the Danish kings quickly made him one of their leading creditors with his chief possession in Funen. During the rebellion against Christopher II 1326 John supported Gerhard III and the Danish magnates and enlarged his Danish possessions. The growing rivalry between John III and Gerhard III led him to support the restoration Christopher as a king 1330 but the co-operation between the two half-brothers in 1331 against Gerhard III ended in a defeat. John politically survived this setback but had to accept Gerhard III as his superior. From 1332 to 1340 John was the master of Denmark east of the Great Belt. However, by 1332 he lost Scania which rebelled against the German rule submitting to the Swedish king. Though a kind of a co-ruler with Gerhard III, John did not play a very great political role and preferred to concentrate on his economic profit ‚Äì like Gerhard III he was pestered by his own minor creditors. After Gerhard III's death and the collapse of Holstein-Rendsburg's rule 1340 John at first co- operated with King Valdemar IV in order to get his money back but during the following years he was slowly but surely outmaneuvered from his Danish possessions by war and by economic transactions. In 1350 his nephew, Gerhard V, Count of Holstein-Pl√∂n, bequeathed Holstein-Pl√∂n to John. At his death, his German possessions of Holstein-Pl√∂n and Holstein-Kiel were inherited by his son Adolph IX. In Danish tradition John is overshadowed by Gerhard III as a Holstein ruler in Denmark. In fact not much is known about John‚Äôs character but he seems to have been a clever diplomat whose ambitions owing to circumstances were gradually limited to economic demands.

During his 24 April 2006 concert at Irving Plaza in New York City, Lee described how he came up with the title for the track, recalling that he'd been listening to the Verve's \\"The Drugs Don't Work\\" and was so impressed with its title that he decided to name his own song with a similarly catchy title. The title of \\"Cigarettes Will Kill You\\" as well as many of the lyrics refer to cigarette smoking as a metaphor for continuing to go back to a bad relationship even though one knows it will end terribly and cause pain. Lee recounted how one often badly needs short-term comfort to get through an otherwise sad, frustrating life even though everyone knows that smoking can cause health problems. The single's cover even resembles a pack of cigarettes. The song was featured in the 2002 Australian comedy Crackerjack.

Barristers have traditionally had the role of handling cases for representation in court, both defence and prosecution. (The word 'lawyer' is a generic one, referring to a person who practises in law, which could also be deemed to include other legal practitioners such as chartered legal executives.) Origin of the profession The work of senior legal professionals in England and Wales is divided between solicitors and barristers. Both are trained in law but serve differing functions in the practice of law. Historically, the superior courts were based in London, the capital city. To dispense justice throughout the country, a judge and court personnel would periodically travel a regional circuit to deal with cases that had arisen there. From this developed a body of lawyers who were on socially familiar terms with the judges, had training and experience in the superior courts, and had access to a greater corpus of research material and accumulated knowledge on the interpretation and application of the law. Some would go \\"on circuit\\" with the court to act on behalf of those requiring representation. By contrast, solicitors were essentially local to one place, whether London or a provincial town. Lawyers who practised in the courts in this way came to be called \\"barristers\\" because they were \\"called to the Bar\\", the symbolic barrier separating the public‚Äîincluding solicitors and law students‚Äîfrom those admitted to the well of the Court. They became specialists either in appearing in court to represent clients, or in the process of using the courts, which would include giving oral or written advice on the strength of a case and the best way to conduct it. For those who had the means and preference to engage a solicitor, it became useful, then normal and then compulsory, for the solicitor, in turn, to select and engage a barrister to represent the client before the courts. Likewise, it became either useful or normal (but not compulsory) to engage an appropriate barrister when highly specialist advice was required. Many barristers have largely \\"paper practices\\" and rarely or (in some cases) never make court appearances. Historically, practising at the bar (or in court) was a more socially prestigious profession than working as a solicitor. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the bar was one of the limited number of professions considered suitable for upper-class men; politics, the Army and Navy, the established clergy, and the civil and diplomatic services being the others. Many leading eighteenth and nineteenth-century politicians were barristers; few were solicitors. In the 20th century, solicitors closed the gap greatly, especially in terms of earnings, and by the early 21st century the social gap was far less important than formerly.  Key differences from the profession of solicitor  Until recently, the most obvious differences between the two professions was that, firstly, only barristers had exclusive and wide rights of audience (that is, a right to plead) in all courts in England and Wales, and secondly, only solicitors could be directly engaged by clients for payment. These differences have been eroded by recent deliberate changes, although in many fields of legal practice, the distinction is largely retained in practice. Barristers have full rights of audience to appear in all courts, from highest to lowest. Solicitors, on the other hand, have traditionally been able to appear only as advocates in the lower courts (that is, the magistrates' and county courts) and tribunals. The bulk of such work continues to be handled by solicitors. Under section 17 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, solicitors with appropriate advocacy experience are entitled to acquire higher \\"rights of audience\\", enabling them to appear in the superior courts. Solicitors who attain these rights are known as solicitor-advocates. But, in practice, the number of solicitor-advocates exercising their right to do so remains fairly small, and solicitors often continue to engage a barrister to undertake any required advocacy in court. Not only is this division traditional; in higher-value civil or more serious criminal cases, it is often tactically imperative to engage a specialist advocate (because if one side does not the other might). Until 2004, barristers were prohibited from seeking or accepting \\"instructions\\" (that is, being hired) directly by the clients whom they represent. The involvement of a solicitor was compulsory. The rationale was that solicitors could investigate and gather evidence and instructions and filter them ‚Äì according to the interests of the client ‚Äì before presenting them to the barrister; in return the barrister, being one step removed from the client, could reach a more objective opinion of the merits of the case, working strictly from the evidence that would be admissible in court. In addition, being less involved in the current affairs of clients, including many matters that might never come to court, barristers had more time for research and for keeping up to date with the law and the decisions (precedent) of the courts. Theoretically, this prohibition has been removed. In certain areas (but not crime or conveyancing), barristers may now accept instructions from a client directly (\\"Direct Access\\"). Only a solicitor, however, may undertake any work that requires funds to be held on behalf of a client. A barrister is in principle required to act for any client offering a proper fee, regardless of the attractions or disadvantages of a case and the personal feelings of the barrister towards the client. This is known as the \\"cab-rank rule\\", since the same rule applies to licensed taxi- cabs. Modifying conditions include that the barrister is available to take the case and feels competent to handle the work. A barrister who specialises in, for example, crime is not obliged to take on employment law work if he is offered it. He is entitled (and, even, obliged) to reject a case which he feels is too complicated for him to deal with properly. Manner of work Barristers work in two main contexts: in self-employed practice (formerly known as \\"independent practice\\") or in \\"employed\\" practice (i.e. salaried). Most barristers are in self-employed practice, but operate within the framework of a set of Chambers. Under a tenancy agreement, they pay a certain amount per month (\\"rent\\") or a percentage of their incomes, or a mixture of the two, to their chambers, which provides accommodation and clerical support (including the crucial function of booking, and sometimes of finding, work). The Head of Chambers, usually a Queen's Counsel (also referred to as \\"QC\\" or \\"Silk\\") or a \\"senior junior\\", may exercise a powerful influence on the members, and members often offer informal help and guidance to each other. They are not liable for each other's business (as partners are). Members of the same set of chambers may appear on opposite sides in the same case. Each barrister remains an independent practitioner, being solely responsible for the conduct of his own practice and keeping what he earns. He does not receive a salary from anyone. A barrister in independent practice will be instructed by a number of different solicitors (\\"professional clients\\") to act for various individuals, government departments, agencies or companies (\\"lay clients\\"). By contrast, an \\"employed\\" barrister is a barrister who works as an employee within a larger organisation, either in the public or private sector. For example, employed barristers work within government departments or agencies (such as the Crown Prosecution Service), the legal departments of companies, and in some cases for firms of solicitors. Employed barristers will typically be paid a salary, and in most circumstances may do work only on behalf of their employer, rather than accepting instructions on behalf of third parties (such as their employers' customers). They remain subject to the Bar Council's Code of Professional Conduct, and their advice is entitled to professional privilege against disclosure. New entrants to the employed bar must have completed pupillage in the same way as those in independent practice. The Bar Council produces exhaustive guidance regulating the way in which both groups operate, although in 2006 some of the regulatory authority was passed over to the independent Bar Standards Board. In 2011 there were around 12,000 barristers in independent practice,Solicitor or barrister? of which about ten per cent were QC. A further group (about 3,300)Solicitor or barrister? were employed in companies as ‚Äòin-house‚Äô counsel, or by local or national government, or in academic institutions. = Appearance and forms of address = The appearance and form of address of a barrister is bound by a number of conventions. A barrister's appearance in court depends on whether the hearing is \\"robed\\" or not. In England and Wales, criminal cases in the Crown Court are almost invariably conducted with the barristers' wearing robes, but there is an increasing tendency in civil cases to dispense with them. The vast majority of County Court hearings are now conducted without robes, although the traditional attire continues to be worn in High Court proceedings. At a robed hearing, barristers wear a horsehair wig, an open black gown, dark suit and a shirt, with strips of white cotton called 'bands' or 'tabs' worn over a winged collar, instead of a tie. Female barristers wear either the same shirt or a special collar which includes the bands and tucks inside a suit jacket. QCs wear slightly different silk gowns over short embroidered black jackets and striped trousers. Solicitors wear a black gown (of a distinct style), wing collar and band and a wig. The question of barristers' and judges' clothing in the civil courts was the subject of review, and there is some pressure to adopt a more \\"modern\\" style of dress, with European-style gowns worn over lounge suits. Guidance from the Bar Council has resulted in robes being worn for trials and appeals in the County Court more than formerly.\\"Court Dress: Revised Guidance\\", Bar Council In court, barristers refer to each other as \\"my learned friend\\"., Criminal Justice, Advocacy and the Bar at ¬ß 1.8 When referring to an opponent who is a solicitor, the term used is \\"my friend\\" ‚Äì irrespective of the relative ages and experiences of the two. In an earlier generation, barristers would not shake hands or address each other formally. The rule against shaking hands is no longer generally observed, though the rule regarding formal address is still sometimes observed: at Gray's Inn, when toasting other barristers, a barrister will address another only by surname, without using a prefix such as 'Miss'.  Regulation  Beginning in January 2006, standards for admission to the bar and disciplinary proceedings are administered by the Bar Standards Board (BSB), a regulatory board of the General Council of the Bar. The BSB is not legally separate from the General Council of the Bar, but is set up so as to be independent of it.The Bar Standards Board Previously, barristers were governed by the General Council of the Bar and the individual Inns of Court. There are four Inns, all situated in the area of London close to the Law Courts in the Strand. Gray's Inn is off High Holborn, Lincoln's Inn off Chancery Lane, the Middle and Inner Temples, situated between Fleet Street and the Embankment. The Inns provide a social and professional hub where barristers and jurists can meet. They comprise a grand hall where barristers dine and attend social functions, and include an extensive library. Several rooms are available for conferences and a place for trainee barristers to engage in advocacy practice. Two of the Inns have chapels, and Middle Temple and Inner Temple share Temple Church. All four Inns are set in well-tended gardens and are surrounded by chambers often organised in courtyards and squares.  Direct public access to barristers  Members of the public may engage the services of the barrister directly under the Public Access Scheme; a solicitor is not involved at any stage. Barristers undertaking public access work can provide legal advice and representation in court in all areas of law (see the Public Access Information on the Bar Council website) and are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in England and Wales. Once instructions from a client are accepted, it is the barrister (rather than the solicitor) who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure or litigation. Before a barrister can undertake Public Access work, he or she must have completed a special course. At present, about 1 in 20 barristers has so qualified. 'Licensed Access' is a separate scheme available to certain nominated classes of professional client; it is not open to the general public. It is an early 21st-century development to enable barristers to accept instructions directly from clients; it results from a change in the rules set down by the General Council of the Bar in July 2004. The Public Access Scheme has been introduced as part of a larger effort to open up the legal system to the public, and to make it easier and cheaper for individuals to obtain access to legal advice. It reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers. The distinction remains, however, because a solicitor's role has certain aspects which a barrister is not able to undertake.  Education and training  A prospective barrister must first complete the academic stage of their legal education by obtaining a qualifying law degree. In lieu of a formal law degree, however, the individual may undertake a one-year law conversion course, formerly known as the CPE (Common Professional Examination) or PGDL (Postgraduate Diploma in Law), and now known simply as a GDL (Graduate Diploma in Law), having initially graduated in a subject other than law. The student joins one of the Inns of Court and takes the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) at one of the accredited providers. It is still mandatory to \\"keep terms\\" before the student can be called to the bar. The student must participate in 12 qualifying sessions, which may include dining in the Hall of the Inn.The Inns of Court, Chambers Student It used to be a prerequisite that 24 dinners were eaten before call, but the number has since been reduced to twelve. Dining credits are available for participating in specified training events (e.g., a weekend at Cumberland Lodge organised by one of the Inns credits attendees with three dinners). It is also possible to \\"double-dine\\" on various special occasions, by which the student is credited with two sessions. The origins of this date from the time when both students and practitioners dined together; students learned elements of their education from their fellow diners and from readings given by a senior member of the Inn (Master Reader) after the meal. Generally, in order for the dinner to count towards the 12 required, the student must remain seated until after coffee has been served. Often moots (legal debates arguing for or against a point before a notional appellate court) are held in the hall afterwards. At the successful completion of the BPTC (where continuous assessment, as well as examinations, are now the rule), and completion of the requisite number of dining nights, students are entitled, subject to various formalities, to be \\"called to the Bar\\" at a ceremony in their Inn. This is conducted by the Masters of the Bench, or Benchers, who are generally senior practising barristers or judges. Once called to the bar, the new barrister has a choice whether or not to pursue a career in practice. As there are far more applicants for \\"tenancy\\" in barristers' \\"Chambers\\" (see below) than there are places, many barristers are unable to obtain a tenancy and choose to go into commercial or academic work. Those choosing not to practice continue to be recognised as 'barristers', although may not provide legal services under this label, and remain subject to some limited regulation by the Bar Standards Board. Mason, M. (2014). \\"UK: Room at the Inns‚ÄîThe Increased Scope of Regulation under the New Bar Standards Board Handbook for England and Wales\\", Legal Ethics, 17(1) 143 One who wishes to become a practising barrister must first obtain a \\"pupillage\\". This is a competitive process which involves some 4,000 students applying for some 300 places each year.\\"Pupillage\\", Bar Standards Board The online pupillage application system, Pupillage Portal (formerly known as OLPAS), enables applicants to submit their details to up to 12 barristers' chambers.\\"A career at the Bar\\", Chambers Student The Pupillage Portal system is used by most chambers to recruit their pupils; many, however, do not, and such chambers must be contacted directly by applicants. There is no limit to the number of non-OLPAS chambers that an applicant can contact. Such chambers' recruiting deadlines broadly mirror those of the Pupillage Portal sets. Pupillage consists of a period of 12 months, where the pupil studies with and under a practising barrister of at least 5 years' experience. The time is traditionally served in two six-month periods under different pupil-masters (three-month periods are becoming increasingly common), usually in the same chambers. Traditionally, the pupil was paid nothing and could earn no fees until the second six-month period, when he or she was entitled to undertake work independently. All sets are now required to pay their pupils a minimum of ¬£12,000 per year. Some pay considerably more than that, although others have applied for exemption and do not guarantee any income. The Bar is a highly varied profession, both in terms of the specialism (or otherwise) of individual sets of chambers, and in the financial rewards available. For sets doing predominantly publicly funded work, earnings are low for new practitioners. In more specialised areas serving private clients, such as commercial, tax, or chancery work, earnings are far higher, and at least comparable to those of similarly experienced solicitors in big city firms. After pupillage, the new barrister must find a seat or \\"tenancy\\" in a set of chambers. Chambers are groups of barristers and tend to comprise between 20 and 60 barristers. The members of a Chambers share the rent and facilities, such as the service of \\"clerks\\" (who combine some of the functions of agents, administrators and diary managers), secretaries and other support staff. Most chambers operate a system whereby the members contribute to these common expenses by paying a certain percentage of their gross income. However, there is no profit-sharing as in a business partnership. Individual barristers keep the fees they earn, beyond what they have to pay towards professional expenses. The Bar remains a highly individualistic profession, and earnings vary widely ‚Äì from some newly qualified (usually criminal) juniors who are lucky to earn ¬£25,000 per year to the top Queen's Counsel (QCs or 'silks' as they are known, from their silk gowns) making well in excess of ¬£1 million a year (with a handful of tax and commercial QCs reported to earn more than ¬£2 million a year).Thom Dyke, Although not all barristers practise from the Inns (for reasons such as the limited amount of space available), the majority still practise from chambers. The names placed on boards at the entrances of many of the staircases of the buildings within the Inns are the names of the tenant barristers (and occasionally distinguished members now prominent in judicial or political life) practising from the chambers in those buildings. Popular culture Some of the principles and traditions that have given the profession its unique character have been caricatured in John Mortimer's Rumpole of the Bailey tales and the television episodes based on them. Novelist Caro Fraser also wrote a popular series of books about a fictional series of barrister's chambers called Caper Court. In television the bar was popularised by actor John Thaw's portrayal of the title character in Kavanagh QC. Peter Moffat (who created Kavanagh QC) also later created a further television series about barristers called Silk (in reference to the silk gowns of Queen's Counsel) and North Square.

The first was one of the French Revolutionary Armies that fought with distinction against the First Coalition from 1792 to 1795. Others existed during the Peninsular War, the Hundred Days and the Franco-Prussian War. Campaigns =1791 to 1797= At the creation of the Army of the North on 14 December 1791, the government of the First French Republic appointed Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, as its commander. Rochambeau was replaced in May 1792, and he retired from service. The suspicious government of the First French Republic later charged him with treason and he barely escaped execution. In 1792-1794, the guillotine awaited military commanders who either failed, belonged to the nobility, or displayed insufficient revolutionary zeal. In the Army of the North these unfortunates included Nicolas Luckner, Adam Custine, and Jean Houchard. Under Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez, the Army of the North helped blunt the Prussian invasion at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792. It also made up a large part of Dumouriez's expedition into the Austrian Netherlands which resulted in victory at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792. On 18 March 1793, the Austrians defeated Dumouriez at the Battle of Neerwinden. Auguste Dampierre was killed in battle on 8 May at the Battle of Raismes near Valenciennes.Smith, p 45 Under Fran√ßois Joseph Drouot de Lamarche, the army lost again at the Battle of Famars on 23 May.Smith, p 46 Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine skirmished with the Coalition army at Caesar's Camp near Cambrai on 7 August.Smith, p 50 Houchard won the Battle of Hondshoote in September, forcing the English to raise the Siege of Dunkirk. Nevertheless, the government arrested Houchard for not following up his victory and executed him. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan won the Battle of Wattignies in October. On 17-18 May 1794, the Army of the North won a victory at the Battle of Tourcoing while under the temporary leadership of Joseph Souham. The right wing of the army fought under Jourdan in an important victory at the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June. Soon after this, the Allied position in Flanders collapsed, leading to Austria's loss of Belgium and the extinction of the Dutch Republic in the winter of 1794-1795. During this period, the army was engaged in mopping up operations and sieges. On 25 October 1797, the Army of the North officially ceased to exist and its troops became an army of occupation in the newly created Batavian Republic. Marshal Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, first commander of the Army of the North The Army of the North's commanders are listed as follows.French wikipedia, \\"Armee du Nord\\" * Marshal Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, 14 December 1791 - 18 May 1792 * Marshal Nicolas Luckner, 19 May - 11 July 1792 * General Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, 12 July - 19 August 1792 * General Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez, 18 August - 28 September 1792 * General Anne Fran√ßois Augustin de La Bourdonnaye, 28 September - 25 November 1792 * General Francisco de Miranda, 16 November 1792 - 1 February 1793 * General Dumouriez, 2 February - 4 April 1793 * General Auguste Marie Henri Picot Dampierre, 6 April - 8 May 1793 * General Fran√ßois Joseph Drouot de Lamarche, 8 - 27 May 1793 * General Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine, 28 May - 16 July 1793 * General Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine, 17 July - 10 August 1793 * General Jean Nicolas Houchard, 11 August - 23 September 1793 * General Florent Joseph Duquesnoy, 24 - 25 November 1793 * General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, 25 September - 9 November 1793 * General Duquesnoy, 10 - 14 November 1793 * General Jourdan, 15 November 1793 - 12 January 1794 * General Jean Henri Becays Ferrand, 13 January - 8 February 1794 * General Jean-Charles Pichegru, 9 February - 18 October 1794 * General Jean Victor Marie Moreau, 19 October - 4 December 1794 * General Pichegru, 5 December 1794 - 20 March 1795 * General Moreau, 21 March 1795 - 29 March 1796 * General Joseph Souham, 30 March - 3 April 1796 * General Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville, 4 April - 15 September 1796 * General Jean Fran√ßois Aim√© Dejean, 16 September 1796 - 24 September 1797 =1811 to 1813= The Army of the North in Spain formed in January 1811 and included soldiers from the Imperial Guard. Its duties included holding cities and fortresses in northern Spain, fighting guerillas, and keeping the roads to France clear. On 3-5 May 1811, about 1,600 cavalry and six artillery pieces belonging to the army fought at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro.Glover, p 390-391 The Spanish beat a 1,500-man detachment on 23 June at Cogorderos in Le√≥n (province). This action prevented the army from helping in the fight against Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese Army.Smith, p 365 Only 800 men fought at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813. After the disastrous defeat at Vitoria, the Army of the North became part of the reorganized Army of Spain. Its commanders were as follows.Glover, p 369-370. Note that Glover incorrectly lists Louis Marc Caffarelli instead of his brother. * Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res, January - July 1811 * General of Division Jean-Marie Dorsenne, July 1811 - May 1812 * General of Division Marie-Fran√ßois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga, May 1812 - January 1813 * General of Division Bertrand Clausel, January 1813 - July 1813 =1815= This name was also given to the force commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte during the Waterloo Campaign in 1815. At its height, including reserves, it numbered 130,000 strong and consisted of many veterans from previous campaigns. In terms of quality it was the best army Napoleon had commanded since 1812 when he had led his Grande Arm√©e (Grand Army) to disaster in Russia. It also fielded proportionally more artillery (344 pieces) and significantly more cavalry, than had French armies in the campaigns of 1813 and 1814. Its left and right wings (Aile Gauche and Aile Droite) were under the independent command of Marshals Ney and Grouchy respectively, when Napoleon himself was not present to direct them. This Arm√©e du Nord is often mistakenly regarded as separate from Arm√©e de la R√©serve (Reserve Army), which it fought beside during the 1815 campaign. In fact the Arm√©e de la R√©serve was simply a large corps of the Arm√©e du Nord that remained under Napoleon's direct command. For more detailed organizational details on this Arm√©e du Nord, see Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign. =1870-1871= During the Franco-Prussian War a new Army of the North was created under Louis Faidherbe to try to break the Siege of Paris from the North. The army had achieved several small victories at towns such as Ham, La Hallue, and Amiens and was protected by the belt of fortresses in northern France, allowing Faidherbe's men to launch quick attacks against isolated Prussian units, then retreat behind the fortresses. Despite access to the armaments factories of Lille, the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties, which depressed morale. In January 1871, L√©on Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle. The army was severely weakened by low morale, supply problems, the terrible winter weather and low troop quality, whilst general Faidherbe was unable to command due to his poor health, the result of decades of campaigning in West Africa. At the Battle of St. Quentin, the Army of the North suffered a crushing defeat and was scattered, releasing thousands of Prussian soldiers to be relocated to the East.

He is mainly known for his work on infectious diseases. His works paved the way for the beginning of modern bacteriology, and inspired Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. He was the first to identify a bacterium that causes diphtheria, which was called Klebs‚ÄìLoeffler bacterium (now Corynebacterium diphtheriae). He was the father of physician Arnold Klebs. Life Klebs was born in K√∂nigsberg, Province of Prussia. He studied at the University of W√ºrzburg under Rudolf Virchow in 1855 and received his doctorate at the University of Berlin in 1858. He achieved his habilitation at the University of K√∂nigsberg the following year. Klebs was an assistant to Virchow at the Charit√© in Berlin from 1861 until 1866, when he became a professor of pathology at the University of Bern in Switzerland. He married Rosa Grossenbacher, a Swiss, and also acquired Swiss citizenship. He served as a military physician for the Prussian Army in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War; several of his ancestors had fought during the Napoleonic Wars. Klebs taught at W√ºrzburg from 1872 to 1873, at Prague from 1873 to 1882, and at Z√ºrich from 1882 to 1892. Because of disagreements with the rest of the faculty, the impetuous Klebs resigned from Z√ºrich in 1893 and ran an unsuccessful private business in Karlsruhe and Strassburg in 1894. From 1896 to 1900, Klebs taught at Rush Medical College in Chicago, United States. From 1905 to 1910, he was a private researcher in Berlin, after which he returned to Switzerland, living with his oldest son in Lausanne. Klebs died in Bern. Discoveries In 1883, Klebs successfully identified the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae as the etiological cause of diphtheria. This bacterium is also known as the Klebs-L√∂ffler bacillus. The bacterial genus Klebsiella is named in honor of his work. Klebs' works preceded some of the most important discoveries in medicine. He described acromegaly in 1884, two years before Pierre Marie. In 1878, he successfully inoculated syphilis in monkeys, antedating √âlie Metchnikoff and √âmile Roux by 25 years. He isolated colonies of bacteria nine years before Robert Koch. He was the first to produce tuberculosis experimentally in animals by the injection of milk from infected cows. He identified the typhoid bacillus (now named Salmonella typhi) before Karl Joseph Eberth. = Fundamental tests in bacteriology = Klebs identified four \\"Grundversuche\\" (fundamental tests) that provided a basis for his own research strategy, as well as general bacteriological research. According to Klebs, the bacteriological tests consist of the following postulates: *First, all bacteria are pathological. *Second, bacteria never occur spontaneously. *Third, every disease is caused only by bacteria. *Fourth, the bacteria that cause distinguishable disease are distinguishable. Although some of these hypotheses are literally false, they are in general the foundation of modern experiments in bacteriology. Scientific blunders Klebs made some significant errors about infectious diseases. He believed, for example, that malaria was caused by a bacterium. In 1879, Corrado Tommasi- Crudeli and he claimed that they isolated a bacterium from the waters of Pontine Marshes in Roman Campagna. They concluded that the bacterium was the pathogen for malaria as they discovered it from damp soil in the region of malaria epidemics. They gave it the name Bacillus malariae. They further experimented with the bacterial isolate which they injected into rabbits. They observed that infected rabbits developed fever and enlarged spleen, characteristics of malaria. They proposed that the malarial bacterium was transmitted by drinking contaminated water or inhalation from air. Klebs reported that antimalarial drug quinine killed the germ. The discovery was supported by leading malariologists of the time. It was then declared that the malaria problem was solved. When a French Army physician Charles Alphonse Laveran correctly discovered in 1880 that malaria was caused by a protozoan parasite (which he called Oscillaria malariae, now Plasmodium falciparum), the discovery was ignored in preference of the bacillus theory of Klebs and Tommasi-Crudeli. An American physician, though, George Miller Sternberg, proved that the bacillus did not cause specific symptoms of malaria in 1881. The bacillus theory was eventually proved wrong by the experimental demonstration of the mosquito-malaria theory in 1898. Klebs also made mistakes in claiming the existence of Microzoon septicum as causative agent of wound infection, and \\"monadines\\" as the pathogen for rheumatism.

It was the second horror film made by Ram Gopal Verma after Raat.http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/may/27ramu.htm It was perceived to be different from a typical Hindi film as it did not contain songs. It was later dubbed in Telugu as 12 Va Anthasthu and remade in Tamil as Shock. The film was a box-office hit. Urmila won several accolades and awards for her performance as a ghost possessed wife. Verma made a sequel called Bhoot Returns which was released on 12 October 2012. Plot The story is about Vishal (Ajay Devgn) who is married to Swati (Urmila Matondkar). The couple rents a high rise apartment at a ridiculously low price. The caretaker of the apartment, Mr. Thakkar (Amar Talwar) explains to Vishal that a widow named Manjeet Khosla (Barkha Madan), the previous resident, committed suicide after killing her own son. Vishal hides this fact from Swati, as she will object to buying such a residence. But the caretaker accidentally slips in the secret. Swati is extremely livid at Vishal, although he disbelieves the notions of ghosts and bad luck. Then, Swati starts behaving very strangely. Vishal consults Dr. Rajan (Victor Banerjee). But soon enough, Vishal witnesses Swati brutally murdering the watchman of the apartment which no human could have done, and his skepticism is rudely challenged. Inspector Liyaqat Qureshi (Nana Patekar), who reaches the apartment to investigate the death, becomes suspicious of the duo and their strange behavior. He follows Vishal and Dr. Rajan. Vishal's maid witnesses Swati shouting and throwing Vishal away. She helps him tie her. She tells him that Swati was shouting just like Manjeet and tells him that an exorcist can help her but not doctors. Finally, Vishal's maid calls an exorcist named Sarita (Rekha). Sarita sees the ghosts of Manjeet and her son. She advises Vishal to meet Manjeet's mother (Tanuja), since she can placate her daughter's spirit. Vishal complies and meets Manjeet's mother. He learns from Manjeet's mother that Manjeet was not the type of woman who would commit suicide nor murder her own son. He explains the situation to her and asks her help. She comes with him and somehow placates Manjeet's spirit. They come to know that Mr. Thakkar's son, Sanjay (Fardeen Khan) tried to molest Manjeet and when she resisted, she accidentally fell off the balcony and died. Hence, Sarita advises Vishal to call him. Vishal makes an unknown call to Sanjay and tells him that his father is sick. When Sanjay arrives, Vishal cleverly tells Mr. Thakkar and Sanjay to help him take Swati to the hospital. It is then revealed that many years ago, Sanjay came to visit his father and lusted for Manjeet, after he saw her in the apartment. He broke into her house, and attempted to profess his lust, but when she rejected him, he pushed her and she accidentally fell off the balcony and died. Manjeet's young son witnessed the murder, upon which Sanjay hired the watchman to kill him. Manjeet, who has still possessed Swati's body, sees Sanjay and chases him. Qureshi tries to stop her, having no idea of the real story. Swati tries to kill Sanjay by strangulating him. But, Sarita asks Manjeet to leave him as Swati would be blamed later on. Sanjay escapes, only to find himself surrounded by Vishal, Sarita, Manjeet and Qureshi who now know the truth. A terrified Sanjay confesses to the crimes, upon which Manjeet's mother urges her to stop. Sanjay is arrested by Inspector Qureshi, and thrown into jail. Manjeet leaves Swati's body, and Vishal and Swati live a good life in the apartment. Meanwhile, in the lockup, Qureshi tells Sanjay that death sentences are light penalties for a criminal like him. He wishes that Sanjay gets a bigger punishment. After Qureshi leaves the darkened cell, Sanjay finds himself face to face with Manjeet. He starts begging for mercy, but his voice soon fades out as Manjeet draws closer; it is implied that she kills Sanjay.

The race name is the only surviving one as other race clubs around Australia have eliminated the long distance race from their calendar. History Grand Flaneur winner of the 1881 VRC St Leger First run in 1857, the race was originally held in March as part of the Victoria Racing Club Autumn Carnival. In 1907 the race was run on the same race card as the Newmarket Handicap. In an effort to promote the Australian Thoroughbred breeding industry, from 1932 to 1956 geldings were banned from competing in the St. Leger. Past St Leger Stakes winners include Australian Racing Hall of Fame inductees Grand Flaneur (1881), Poseidon (1907), Phar Lap (1930), Tranquil Star (1941) and Tulloch (1958). Several winners also captured Australia's most prestigious race, the Melbourne Cup. They are: Grand Flaneur (1881), Phar Lap (1930), Comic Court (1949), Delta (1950), and Gurner's Lane (1982). In 1956, Sailor's Guide won the race and in 1958 raced in North America where he defeated a top international field in the forerunner to the Breeders' Cup Turf, the then very prestigious Washington, D.C. International Stakes. Poseidon, 1907 winner =Venue= The St. Leger was hosted by Moonee Valley Racecourse in 2001 and again in 2007 due to track refurbishments being carried out at the Flemington racecourse. =Distance= The race was held over a distance of 14 furlongs, 132 yards until 1973 when it was modified to the metric distance of 2800 metres. In 1975 the race was run over 2700 metres. In 2001 and 2007, the distance was changed to 2500 metres when the race was run at Moonee Valley Racecourse while Flemington was under redevelopment. =Grade= *1857-1979 - Principal Race *1980-1990 - Group 2 *1991-2005 - Group 3 *2006 onwards - Listed Race =Records= Previously tied with T.J.

Southernwood has a strong camphor- like odour and was historically used as an air freshener or strewing herb. It forms a small bushy shrub, which is widely cultivated by gardeners. The grey- green leaves are small, narrow and feathery. The small flowers are yellow. It can easily be propagated by cuttings, or by division of the roots. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Uses A yellow dye can be extracted from the branches of the plant, for use with wool. Its dried leaves are used to keep moths away from wardrobes. The volatile oil in the leaves is responsible for the strong, sharp, scent which repels moths and other insects. It was customary to lay sprays of the herb amongst clothes, or hang them in closets, and this is the origin of one of the southernwood's French names, \\"garderobe\\" (\\"clothes-preserver\\"). Judges carried posies of southernwood and rue to protect themselves from prisoners' contagious diseases, and some church-goers relied on the herb's sharp scent to keep them awake during long sermons.Alice Morse Earle (1851-1911), The Sabbath in Puritan New England, chapter 4. The pungent, scented leaves and flowers are used in herbal teas. Young shoots were used to flavor pastries and puddings. In Italy, it is used as a culinary herb.

Leech was born into a secular working-class family in Ashton-under- Lyne in greater Manchester. As a teenager he became a Christian and a socialist at the same time. A speech denouncing apartheid at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester in 1956 by Trevor Huddleston, a priest of the Community of the Resurrection who had just returned from South Africa, had a particularly powerful impact on him. He would remember thinking, \\"If this faith could drive this man to oppose racism with such passion, perhaps it could drive me too.\\" Leech moved to the East End of London in 1958 where he began his studies for a degree in history at King's College, London. This move, he later wrote, was the real turning point of his life. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961 and then went to Trinity College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1964. He was also ordained to the diaconate in 1964. After theological studies at St Stephen's House, Oxford, he was ordained to the priesthood in 1965. He served in urban London parishes afflicted by poverty and confronted issues of racism and drug abuse. After ordination, he served for two years as a curate at Holy Trinity, Hoxton in the East End of London and then from 1967 to 1971 at St Anne's, Soho. While in Soho, Leech set up the Soho Drug Group (1967) which ministered to young addicts, many of whom had been drawn into prostitution. In 1969, at the instigation of and in conjunction with Anton-Wallich-Clifford and the Simon Community, he established the charity Centrepoint which became the United Kingdom's leading national charity tackling youth homelessness. From 1971 to 1974 he was chaplain and tutor in pastoral studies at St Augustine's College, Canterbury. In 1974 he became rector of St Matthew's Bethnal Green where he served until 1979. While at St Matthew's he became deeply involved in the struggle against the National Front and other racist and fascist groups. In 1974, with Rowan Williams (who became the Archbishop of Canterbury) and others, he founded the Jubilee Group, a network of Christian socialists most of whom were Anglo- Catholics. In 1980 he became Race Relations Field Officer for the British Council of Churches Community and Race Relations Unit. The following year he was named Race Relations Field Officer of the Church of England's Board for Social Responsibility. He was an honorary assistant curate of St Clement's Church, Notting Dale (1982 to 1988), and of St James' Church, Norlands (1985 to 1988). He was director of the Runnymede Trust, a think tank dedicated to promoting ethnic diversity in Britain, from 1987 to 1990. From 1990 until 2004, when he retired from full-time parish ministry, he was community theologian at St Botolph's Aldgate, a church located at the intersection of the City of London and the East End. As archbishop, Rowan Williams awarded him a Lambeth doctorate. Leech was an advocate of contextual theology. As much as he admired the work of academic theologians, he insisted that authentic Christian theology could not be confined to the academy or to the pastor's study. He believed that it must be grounded in prayer and should be the work of the entire local Christian community across the boundaries of class, race, and sex. At the heart of his faith was what he called \\"subversive orthodoxy\\"; the indissoluble union of contemplative spirituality, sacramental worship, orthodox doctrine and social action. He argued that this conjunction of faith and the quest for justice, which points to the coming of the Kingdom of God on earth, is the essential mark of the Christian life and underlies scripture, the teachings of the Church Fathers and the Christian mystical tradition. His work also drew on the radical and even revolutionary strands in Anglo- Catholicism represented by figures such as Stewart Headlam, Thomas Hancock, Charles Marson, Percy Widdrington, Conrad Noel, and Stanley Evans. He respected the contributions of F. D. Maurice, Brooke Foss Westcott, Charles Gore, William Temple, and other reform-minded Anglican Christian socialists, but thought them often to be too timid and middle class. Although Leech was critical of theological liberalism, unlike some Anglo-Catholics he supported the ordination of women and the rights of gay and lesbian people. His publications include guides to prayer and spiritual direction, autobiographical reflections on urban ministry and theological critiques of capitalism and social injustice. Of his weightiest theological work, True God (published in the United States as Experiencing God), the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre wrote that \\"there are few other books that state in so comprehensive a fashion what is at stake in believing or not believing in the God of Catholic Christianity.\\" Leech died of cancer in Manchester on 12 September 2015.

As one of the last surviving veterans of World War I, he was acclaimed as a national hero during the last decade of his life. Life Lockett was born in the small Victorian town of Waanyarra, near Bendigo. He left school at the age of 9 to work on a local farm. Later, he worked for his uncles in The Mallee. On 24 March 1916, he travelled to Mildura to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. He served in France with the 38th Battalion, earning promotion to sergeant and was discharged on 20 September 1919. After the war, Lockett returned to The Mallee and selected a block of land in Linga, Victoria, deciding to make his living as a farmer. In 1923, he married Maybell Ingwerson and they had four children together. In 1963, the couple retired to Bendigo, leaving the farmland (which now covered more than ), in the care of their children and grandchildren. After turning 100, Lockett was regarded in Australia as a \\"legend\\", \\"noted not only for his remarkable lucidity and age, but as one of Australia's few surviving World War I veterans.\\" In 1998, Lockett and his known fellow surviving veterans were awarded Chevalier (Knight) of the L√©gion d'honneur by the French government for their service in the war. The ceremony was held in Lockett's home town of Bendigo, attended by Prime Minister John Howard, who described Lockett as a \\"priceless national treasure .... who represents so much of what is the true Australian spirit ... courage ... adventure ... a willingness to share adversity\\". In 2000, at the age of 109, Lockett participated in the 2000 Olympic Torch Relay. On 11 June 2001, he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the community of Bendigo, particularly as a representative of Australia war veterans. Lockett died of kidney failure at age 111 years, 123 days, just three days after fellow supercentenarian Christina Cock, the oldest woman and person ever in Australia and Oceania. Lockett was the oldest man and Freemason ever in Australia and in Oceania. He was honoured with a state funeral, and described as \\"a hero of the nation\\", who \\"was indeed the quintessential Australian battler. Whatever hand of cards fate dealt him, his response was, \`No worries.' \\" At the time of his death, he was survived by four children: Jack, Kevin, Joyce, and Ron; fifteen grandchildren; and twenty-four great-grandchildren.

Since that time, programmes have normally been funded by a broadcaster and they re-couped the money through selling advertising space around the content. This has worked fine for decades, but new technological advances have forced broadcasters and advertisers to re-think their relationship. The concept is as old as television itself; the term soap opera is derived from the fact that the original soap operas were in fact funded and produced by soap companies such as Procter & Gamble. Shows such as the Texaco Star Theater, which were among the earliest television programs, included the practice. It was not until the quiz show scandals of the late 1950s, when particularly aggressive advertisers began rigging game shows to produce a more entertaining product, that the practice fell on the wayside. By the time television became a worldwide phenomenon in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the original model had mostly been eschewed in favor of the modern model, which separates programming and advertising. (The fact that many of the early television broadcasters outside the United States were public broadcasters that restricted the use of advertising may have been a contributing factor to this.) With the advent of digital recording devices, also known as personal video recorders (PVR's), viewers can choose to record episodes or entire series of their favourite shows and watch them in their own time. Not only does this skew the idea of 'primetime', (advertisers being charged a premium for buying spots around the most popular viewing times), but it means viewers can skip the ads altogether. Advertiser-funded programming, largely a neologism, is a solution to this change and means the advertiser pays to integrate their message in the TV programme itself, rather than just buying advertising space around it. It includes product placement, sponsorship, naming rights and more recently the actual creation of whole shows from scratch. Many of these projects are enabled by a content partnership where the programming is co-funded by multiple stakeholders. Both independent agencies and the global networks have even created dedicated units to concentrate on AFP, such as JWT Entertainment, BBH, Hubbub Communications, Now Inc., Mudra, WPP's Group M, or Omnicom's Grand Central, London based, Advertiser Funded Programming agency.

Retrieved 2011-11-01. Most sports organizations heavily restrict the use of advertiser funded programming, particularly amateur competitions such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup, both of which ban the practice as ambush marketing. Other sports have embraced the practice as an additional form of revenue, both for the leagues and the networks. Naming rights have been sold for bowl games, tournaments, television presentations, halftime shows, stadiums and arenas, with the practice of selling team names more common outside North America, while product placements and advertisements can be seen on the fields, on sideboards surrounding them, or as on-screen graphics without interrupting a telecast. Advertiser funded programming techniques give sports broadcasters a third channel of revenue, in addition to retransmission consent fees and traditional advertising, allowing stations such as ESPN to pay high rights fees and still make significant amounts of money.

Publication history The Shaper of Worlds was created by Archie Goodwin and Herb Trimpe, and first appeared in Incredible Hulk #155 (Sep 1972). Its origin was first revealed in Captain America Annual #7 (1983). Fictional character biography The Shaper of Worlds' existence began thousands of years ago as a Cosmic Cube created by Skrull scientists on an unnamed planet in the Andromeda Galaxy that was part of the Skrull Empire. It was used by the Skrull Emperor to enforce his rule over the Empire as a god-king. The Cube subsequently developed sentience and, because its mind had been imprinted by the megalomaniacal personality of the emperor, it lashed out and devastated a significant portion of the Empire before it reached emotional maturity. It was after this that it started calling itself the \\"Shaper of Worlds\\" and chose the form that it uses to this day: an ivory male Skrull torso atop a metallic frustum and tractor treads for apparent mobility.origin revealed in Captain America Annual #7 On an unnamed extradimensional micro-world, the Shaper created a \\"world\\" based on the Nazi- dominated 1940s Earth from the mind of ex-Nazi scientist Otto Kronsteig. This \\"world\\" was destroyed by the intervention of the Hulk.Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #155 On Earth, the Shaper then created a \\"world\\" based on 1950s American popular culture from the mind of ex-henchman \\"Slugger\\" Johnson; this \\"world\\" was destroyed by the intervention of the Fantastic Four. The Shaper took Thomas Gideon as his apprentice before leaving Earth.Fantastic Four #136-137 The Shaper returns later, creating a \\"paradise world\\" of peace for the Hulk on an unnamed planetoid, based on his fondest dreams from the mind of the Hulk. This is because the Shaper feels guilty for harassing the Hulk earlier. The Shaper creates illusions of the Hulk's long-lost love interest, Jarella; and deceased friend, Crackajack Johnson. The peace is marred by the appearance of the Toad Men, who have invaded looking for slaves.The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #190 (Aug. 1975) In the next issue, the Toad Men kill the Shaper's friend, Glorian. This causes the illusion to fall apart, which sends the Hulk on a rampage. The Toad Men are defeated and the Hulk rejects the Shaper's offer for a new illusionary reality, which destroyed the \\"paradise world\\".Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #191 Glorian was later revealed to be the transformed Thomas Gideon, and was not actually killed on the paradise world. The Shaper witnessed Glorian's attempt to create a \\"world\\" based on the dreams of the inhabitants from a small town ruined by the accidental intervention of the Hulk.Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #267 The Shaper was sent by the Kree Supreme Intelligence to guide the evolution of Earth's Cosmic Cube into a sentient being; while there, the Shaper encountered Captain America and the Aquarian and revealed to them his origin as the Cosmic Cube created long ago by the Skrulls.Captain America Annual #7 With Kubik (formerly the Earth's Cosmic Cube), the Shaper encountered the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom in the universe of the Beyonder. The Shaper recounted the Beyonder's true origin as part of the same force that created the Molecule Man, and witnessed the transformation of the Beyonder and the Molecule Man into a new Cosmic Cube.Fantastic Four #319 The Shaper later allowed Glorian to return to Earth to use his power to help the Hulk achieve nobility.Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #355-356 The outing ultimately went badly for Glorian, and the Shaper rescued the Hulk and Glorian from the demonic attention of Satannish (in the guise of Cloot).Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #359 During the \\"Last Days\\" part of the Secret Wars storyline, Glorian tells the Silver Surfer and Dawn how the Shaper of Worlds will help him rebuild the universe for the heroes to return to after they finish up in Battleworld. It is revealed that the white area that Glorian and his assistant Zee are in is the small spot that is between his eye and his nose.Silver Surfer (vol. 7) #13 Powers and abilities The Shaper of Worlds is an alien matter-energy construct with unknown, and potentially incalculable physical power. He has the ability to restructure finite pockets of reality and to alter the molecular configuration of persons and objects. He is also capable of intergalactic and interdimensional teleportation, and empathic perception. The Shaper's intelligence is immeasurable, but lacking a creative imagination, the Shaper must use the mind of another sentient being as a template for his transformations of worlds. The Shaper has massive power, but he cannot actually create new worlds; after destroying a significant portion of the Skrull Empire, he deliberately limited the scope of his powers. He only rearranges the structure of an existing world to fit the template that has been requested by another. The alien can only create worlds if it has the dreams of another living being to use as a blueprint. These factors are often considered to be the greatest drawbacks to its powers. It is his curse that he has a strong desire to make dreams come true, but does not have any dreams himself. He seeks out other beings that he senses have wishes he can fulfill. Only in this way can he find a release for his strong desire to shape reality. Glorian and Kubik are his prot√©g√©s. The Shaper of Worlds has fought the Hulk, and the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #136-137 It was he who taught the Beyonder and the Molecule Man that they shared a common origin and merged them into the being known as Kosmos. Other versions =Batman vs. the Incredible Hulk= In the 1981 DC/Marvel crossover Batman vs. the Incredible Hulk, the Shaper of Worlds, who was stranded on Earth, teamed with the Joker to acquire a gamma-ray gun to treat a disease he had acquired that was driving him mad. The Joker finally succeeds in stealing the gamma-ray gun, but finding its power insufficient. The entity then realizes the Hulk's gamma radiation in him contains the key to his power being restored, leading the Joker to kidnap the Hulk instead. The plan succeeds, with the Shaper subsequently making the Joker's dreams real, but Batman and the Hulk team up to defeat the duo.DC Special Series #27 (Fall 1981) References External links * Shaper of Worlds at Marvel.com * Category:Characters created by Archie Goodwin Category:Characters created by Herb Trimpe Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972 Category:Marvel Comics Cosmic Cubes ","title":"Shaper of Worlds"},{"id":"2994254","text":"Golbery do Couto e Silva (August 21, 1911 ‚Äì September 18, 1987) was a General in Brazil's Army, an intellectual, as well as a politician. Biography Golbery do Couto e Silva was born in Rio Grande, a city in the Southern State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. At the age of 16, he joined the Military School of Realengo, Rio de Janeiro, which bred officials for the country's Army. On November 22, 1930, he graduated first among all classes becoming an Aspirant Officer. His Combat Arms Branch was Infantry, and by 1932 he was among the 9th Infantry Regiment quenching the 1932 Revolution in S√£o Paulo. As a lieutenant, he also served in the 6th Infantry Regiment. In May 1937 he was promoted to Captain and began to serve on the National Security Council. Later he was sent to Curitiba in the state of Parana. Soon after, he was assigned to Joinville, serving in the 13th Chasseurs' Brigade. In December 1940, he was the only official who was accepted to join Brazil's Army's Higher Command and Staff Course. By the time he graduated, in August 1943, he was appointed to serve at the 3rd Military Region, in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. A year later, in 1944, he trained with the US Army and was soon appointed to serve in the Second World War at the Brazilian Expeditionary Force as an Intelligence Officer remaining in the position until the end of the war. Returning to Brazil in October 1946, Captain Golbery do Couto e Silva was reassigned to the state of Rio Grande do Sul and then to Rio de Janeiro when promoted to Army Major and appointed to serve at the Army's Higher Command. Golbery's path to the highest rank included participating in a Military Mission to Paraguay thenceforth 1947, where he remained for three years. By 1951, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and assigned to serve as Deputy Head of the Army's Information Division. As of 1952, he had been designated Deputy Head of the Studies Department within Brazil's War College's Division for International Affairs, later being assigned to the college's Executive Division. Passing by Belo Horizonte, he was later reassigned to the Army's Higher Command, now as a Colonel, serving in the Operations Division within the Sub-Division of Doctrine. In 1960, he was promoted to Army General and, until February 1961, he was Head of the Operations Division under the Army's Higher Command. In September 1961, serving as Chief of Staff at the National Security Council's General Secretariat, Golbery retired from the military. As a civilian, he headed the Institute for Social Studies and Research, a conservative think tank based in Rio de Janeiro. After the civilian-military coup d'√âtat on March 31, 1964, he was appointed Head of Brazil's secret service, the National Information Service, later serving as Chief of Staff under the terms of Army General Geisel and of Army General Figueiredo, in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The Doctrine of National Security  In 1955, Brazil's Army's Publisher launched Golbery's Planejamento Estrat√©gico (Strategic Planning). His contributions in the form of books did not stop there. In Geopol√≠tica do Brasil (Brazil's Geopolitics), launched in 1966, he forged the notion of a National Security Doctrine underscoring the intrinsic relationship between security and development. Aiming to reclaim the debate from an ideological spectrum that allegedly corrupted Brazil's national interests and identity, his argument revolved around the imperative of an active role played by the State in the economy, which would trickle down as a measure of national security. The book is considered to be seminal for Brazil's civilian-military authoritarian regime.The relevance of Golbery do Couto e Silva Rethinking Golbery At age 76, he passed in S√£o Paulo.

G√∂ldi, who was executed by decapitation, has been called the \\"last witch\\" in Switzerland. Biography Advertisement of reward for G√∂ldi's capture in Z√ºrcher Zeitung. A native of Sennwald, Anna G√∂ldi arrived in Glarus in 1765. When she was 31, G√∂ldi was impregnated by a mercenary, who left Switzerland before G√∂ldi gave birth. G√∂ldi's baby died the first night it was born (something not uncommon due to the high infant mortality of the era). She was pilloried and sentenced to six years of house arrest. G√∂ldi subsequently escaped and found employment with the Zwicky family, and had a son with Melchior Zwicky, though they were not married. G√∂ldi began working as a maid for the Tschudi family in 1780. Jakob Tschudi reported her for having put needles in the bread and milk of one of his daughters, apparently through supernatural means. G√∂ldi at first escaped arrest, but the authorities of the Canton of Glarus advertised a reward for her capture in the Z√ºrcher Zeitung on 9 February 1782. G√∂ldi was arrested and, under torture, admitted to entering in a pact with the Devil, who had appeared to her as a black dog. She withdrew her confession after the torture ended, but was sentenced to execution by decapitation. The charges were officially of \\"poisoning\\" rather than witchcraft, even though the law at the time did not impose the death penalty for non-lethal poisoning. During her trial, official allegations of witchcraft were avoided, and the court protocols were destroyed. The sentence does therefore not strictly qualify as that of a witch trial. Still, because of the apparent witchhunt that led to the sentence, the execution sparked outrage throughout Switzerland and the Holy Roman Empire. The sentence was described at the time by historian August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer as a judicial murder (\\"the murder of an innocent, deliberately, and with all the pomp of holy Justice\\".Ermordung eines Unschuldigen, vors√§tzlich, und so gar mit allem Pompe der heil.

In 1991, Gertrud Pinkus released a film based on Hasler's book. = Exoneration = On 20 September 2007, the Swiss parliament decided to acknowledge Anna G√∂ldi's case as a miscarriage of justice. Fritz Schiesser, as the representative for Glarus in the Swiss parliament, called for Anna G√∂ldi's exoneration, which was granted 226 years after her death, on 27 August 2008 on the grounds that she had been subjected to an \\"illegal trial\\". Apparently, G√∂ldi's married employer abused his power after she had threatened to reveal their affair. = Memorial = The Swiss town of Glarus unveiled a memorial for G√∂ldi in 2014. The memorial, consisting of two permanently lit lamps on the side of the Glarus court house, is intended to draw attention to violations of human rights that occur in the world today, as well as G√∂ldi‚Äôs story. A plaque on the building's facade explains the lamps' significance. \\"The memorial is an expression of atonement for the injustice that took place here. It will be an eternal light for Anna G√∂ldi.\\" On August 20, 2017, the Anna G√∂ldi Museum was opened in the H√§nggiturm building. =In popular culture= The life of G√∂ldi has been the subject of a musical, with G√∂ldi performed by Masha Karell.

More precisely for every pair of integers with , given two positive integers and such that , there are two integers and such that :ay\\\\equiv x \\\\pmod{m} and :x < X,\\\\quad 0 < y < Y. Usually, one takes and equal to the smallest integer greater than the square root of , but the general form is sometimes useful, and make the unicity theorem (below) easier to state.Shoup, theorem 2.33 The first known proof is attributed to , who used a pigeonhole argument. It can be used to prove Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares by taking m to be a prime p that is 1 mod 4 and taking a to satisfy a2 \\\\+ 1 = 0 mod p. (Such an \\"a\\" is guaranteed for \\"p\\" by Wilson's Theorem.) Uniqueness In general, the solution whose existence is asserted by Thue's lemma is not unique. For example, when there are usually several solutions , providing that and are not too small. Therefore, one may only hope unicity for the rational number , to which is congruent modulo if y and m are coprime. Nevertheless, this rational number needs not to be unique; for example, if , and , one has the two solutions :2a+1 \\\\equiv -a+2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod 5. However, for and small enough, if a solution exists, it is unique. More precisely, with above notation, if :2XY < m, and :ay_1-x_1\\\\equiv ay_2-x_2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod m, with :\\\\left  x_1\\\\right < X, \\\\quad\\\\left y_1\\\\right < Y, and :\\\\left x_2\\\\right < X, \\\\quad\\\\left y_2\\\\right < Y, then :\\\\frac{x_1}{y_1}=\\\\frac{x_2}{y_2}. This result is the basis for rational reconstruction, which allows using modular arithmetic for computing rational numbers for which one knows bounds for numerators and denominators.Shoup, section 4.6 The proof is rather easy: by multiplying each congruence by the other and subtracting, one gets :y_2x_1-y_1x_2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod m. The hypotheses imply that each term has an absolute value lower than , and thus that the absolute value of their difference is lower than . This implies that y_2x_1-y_1x_2 =0, and thus the result. Computing solutions The original proof of Thue's lemma is not efficient, in the sense that it does not provide any fast method for computing the solution. The extended Euclidean algorithm, allows us to provide a proof that leads to an efficient algorithm that has the same computational complexity of the Euclidean algorithm.Shoup, section 4.5 More precisely, given the two integers and appearing in Thue's lemma, the extended Euclidean algorithm computes three sequences of integers , and such that :t_im+y_ia =x_i \\\\quad \\\\text{for } i=0, 1, ..., where the are non-negative and strictly decreasing.

Egress filtering helps ensure that unauthorized or malicious traffic never leaves the internal network. In a corporate network, typical recommendations are that all traffic except that emerging from a select set of servers would be denied egress. Restrictions can further be made such that only select protocols such as HTTP, email, and DNS are allowed. User workstations would then need to be configured either manually or via proxy auto-config to use one of the allowed servers as a proxy. Corporate networks also typically have a limited number of internal address blocks in use. An edge device at the boundary between the internal corporate network and external networks (such as the Internet) is used to perform egress checks against packets leaving the internal network, verifying that the source IP address in all outbound packets is within the range of allocated internal address blocks. Egress filtering may require policy changes and administrative work whenever a new application requires external network access. For this reason, egress filtering is an uncommon feature on consumer and very small business networks.

A line of Mondaine watches is heavily influenced by classical Swiss railway clocks, called the Official Swiss Railways Watch/SBB, to a design licensed from the Swiss Federal Railways since 1986. This design, by Hans Hilfiker, originated in 1944. The original movement was unlike other watches and unique because of the following fact: By spreading 58 seconds over the 360 degrees (rather than the usual 60 seconds), the second hand comes to a complete stop at the 12 numeral for two seconds, giving the illusion that time has stopped. Then, the minute hand advances one step and the second hand starts a new cycle. However, the company stopped making models with this mechanism around 2001.Customer service response In 2013, a redesigned model was launched under the name stop2go.Press release by Mondaine, 27 June, 2013 In keeping with how the movement itself works, the crown is shaped like a rocker switch that you flip back and forth instead of winding. In 2006, a fifty-percent stake in the American Luminox company was purchased by the Swiss brand Mondaine, giving Mondaine increased access to the American market, and Luminox increased access to the European and Asian markets.Luminox, the American watch brand teams up with Mondaine, Allbusiness Monday, April 3 2006 Additionally, Mondaine offers a selection of models inspired by modern art.

In its fullest form, it concerns the Fisher King (King Pellehan or Anfortas), the guardian of the Holy Grail, who falls into sin and consequently suffers a wound from a mystical weapon (often the Spear of Destiny from Christian eschatology). He becomes the Maimed King, and his kingdom suffers similarly, becoming the Wasteland: neither will be healed until the successful completion of the Grail Quest. The stroke is usually described as being to the king's thighs: this has been taken as a euphemism for the genitals, which are explicitly stated to be the location of Anfortas's wound in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival. In the Post-Vulgate Cycle, Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, and later works based on them, the stroke is delivered by Sir Balin.

It straddles the boundary between the boroughs of Brent and Barnet and is owned by the Canal & River Trust. The reservoir takes its informal name from a public house called The Welsh Harp, which stood nearby until the early 1970s. It is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the only SSSI in either Borough and among more than 30 SSSIs in London. The reservoir is fed by the Silk Stream and the River Brent. Its main outflow is the River Brent. Its smaller outflow is a feeder channel to the canal system. It holds an estimated . In 1994 when the reservoir was drained more than of fish were captured, 95% of which were roach. However, fishing is prohibited. The reservoir has a sailing centre, home to Welsh Harp Sailing Club, Wembley Sailing Club, the Sea Cadets, and the University of London Sailing club. In 1960, it also hosted the Women's European Rowing Championships. Construction Plans for the construction laid in 1803 were abandoned because of cost. Canal branches and wharves continued to be dug in the early 19th century. Regular traffic meant lock openings draining the local canals (several feet above sea level) leading to canal-water shortages. By 1820 there was not enough water to supply the Grand Union Canal and the Regent's Canal so having obtained an enabling act of Parliament in 1819, the Regent's Canal Company decided to dam the River Brent to create a reservoir and cut a feeder channel from it to an upper point on the Grand Union Canal. It now holds an estimated . The reservoir was constructed by contractor William Hoof between 1834 and 1835. The water flooded much of Cockman's Farm, to supply the Regent's Canal at Paddington. Its owner gave it the name of its then-parish it was named Kingsbury Reservoir. At first it was between Old Kingsbury Church and Edgware Road. Hoof, under the tender awarded for the work (including the construction of a bridge), was paid ¬£2,740 6s 0d ().Birds of Brent Reservoir, 2001 Construction met problems; in August 1835, a few months before completion, four brothers drowned in an accident. Brent Reservoir. Additional building was completed in December 1837 to extend the reservoir. In 1841 after seven days of continuous rain the dam head collapsed, killing two people.Defra: It was after this that a supervisor was employed for the first time, with a cottage near the dam, which remains. At its greatest extent it covered in 1853. It was reduced to in the 1890s; later to . In 1859 the famous Welsh Harp tavern was built on the site of an earlier coaching inn called the Harp or the Harp and Horn. The tavern was demolished in the 1970s, but the reservoir is still colloquially named after it. Sport and recreation During the second half of the 19th century the area became a destination for recreation and evening entertainment, almost entirely due to W.P. Warner (1832‚Äì1899), who in 1858 became licensee of the Old Welsh Harp Tavern. The tavern stood on the Edgware Road, near where it crossed the Brent. Warner, who fought with distinction in the Crimean War, created the tavern along the lines of the London pleasure gardens (ironically at the same time when the most famous of all, the Vauxhall finally closed). For 40 years, Warner made the Old Welsh Harp Tavern one of London's most popular places and it was celebrated in song by the music hall star Annie Adams as 'The Jolliest Place That's Out'. The amusements were focused not just on the inn, but around the reservoir. Warner operated a race track until an Act of Parliament made it illegal. The first greyhound races with mechanical hares took place here in 1876. In 1891 Capazza attempted to launch his Patent Parachute Balloon - it failed to take off and accounts record 'nasty incidents' among the 5,000 spectators. These activities attracted a mixed clientele and crime and violence were not uncommon. One observer described the races as a 'carnival of vice'. The reservoir, like nearby Hampstead Heath, was also famous for Bank Holiday fairs. During its Victorian heyday a bear escaped from the menagerie. =Water sport= The reservoir was popular for speed boat and other water sports, until its size became unsuitable. The reservoir has a sailing centre, home to Welsh Harp Sailing Club, Wembley Sailing Club, the Sea Cadets, and the University of London Sailing club. It also hosted the 1960 European Rowing Championships, which that year was for women only as the men competed at the 1960 Summer Olympics instead.The Brent Magazine, November 2011, p.27 More than 200 competitors and officials attended, with 5,000 spectators. The BBC and Eurovision televised the event. =Cycling= The first formal cycle race was held at the Welsh Harp grounds on 1 June 1868.Cycling Record, UK, 1968 It was won by Arthur Markham. He received a silver cup from the licensee of the Welsh Harp Hotel, the sponsor of the race.Firth, Malcolm www.abcc.co.uk/Articles/bikeevolve.html retrieved 5 September 2008 For many years Markham had a bicycle shop at nearby 345 Edgware Road. The race was held the day after what is often referred to as the world's first race, in the park at St Cloud west of Paris. It was won by another Englishman, James Moore. His grandson, John, believes Moore is buried near the reservoir.Procycling UK p107 =Ice sports= In winter the reservoir froze for skating; national and international ice-skating events were held. In February 1893, Jack Selby drove a coach and four horses across the reservoir. Towards the end of the 19th century, urbanisation led to fewer informally organised frolics. =Miscellaneous= Naturists gathered at the Welsh Harp from 1921, until in June 1930 about 250 sunbathers were attacked by 200 objectors. This is referred to as \\"The Sun-Bathing Riots\\". Transport The Midland Railway built its Welsh Harp station in 1870 on its new line from Bedford to St.Pancras. The area lost its attraction with the development of West Hendon between 1895 and 1915 and the station closed in 1903. War history The Mechanical Warfare Department, part of the War Office based nearby in Cricklewood, used the Welsh Harp for secret tests of a new weapon from 1916: the tank, especially the amphibious Mark IX tank. Early film of these tests was shown on British Television in the late 1990s. During the Second World War, a seaplane kept on the reservoir was rumoured to be an escape route for the Prime Minister. Local residents have recounted swimming to the plane. Wildlife and nature conservation  During construction, the Welsh Harp attracted uncommon birds. James Edmund Harting and Frederick Bond were regular visitors and shot many birds. Harting documented these in his 1866 book the Birds of Middlesex. They included rare vagrants to the UK such as little bittern, squacco heron and white-rumped sandpiper. This started an interest in the birds of the Welsh Harp that continues until today, giving a unique historical perspective of a site in London. The next prominent ornithologist was William Glegg from the 1920s onwards and he wrote a paper for the London Naturalist in 1930 called 'The Birds of Middlesex since 1866, then a follow-up book to Harting's in 1935, called A History of the Birds of Middlesex. After the Second World War, a new generation of ornithologists took an interest, such as Professor Warmington, and Eric Simms, who lived just south of the reservoir in Dollis Hill. They were joined by Dr Leo Batten in the late 1950s. He was one of the movers in setting up the Welsh Harp Conservation Group (WHCG) in 1972 to fight off development. The WHCG has worked to protect the area as a nature reserve, including preventing a golf course and driving range from being built. The WHCG produces an annual report and in 2000 published a book, Birds of Brent Reservoir, which includes chapters on the social history, the effects of urbanisation and the habitats, as well as a study of the birds and other wildlife. The book's information on birds is regularly updated in an electronic publication, Birds of Brent Reservoir: Facts and Figures. All WHCG publication are available through its website. The WHCG also organises management work, which included an annual refurbishment of the tern rafts until the silting up of this part of the reservoir prevented a safe approach to the rafts, and the group works with Brent and Barnet councils on the management of the site, including applying for National Lottery funding. The reservoir and much of its shoreline is a Site of Special Scientific Interest,Brent Reservoir SSSI description mainly due to the diversity of breeding waterbirds. The reservoir and much of the surrounding area are a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation. =Birds of the reservoir= The reservoir is an important site for breeding waterbirds such as great crested grebe, gadwall, shoveler, common pochard, tufted duck and common tern. At one stage, the reservoir was second only to Rutland Water for the most breeding pairs of great crested grebe in the UK. Other breeding birds include eight species of warbler. In 2008, the first nesting attempt by great cormorant took place as well as the first nesting attempt by grey heron for several years. Neither attempt was successful, but grey heron have bred successfully since 2017. The reservoir has always enjoyed a reputation for rare birds. As well as those documented above, it attracted two black-winged stilts in 1918; the first great white egret in London in 1997; the blue-winged teal in 1996; the lesser scaup in 2003; and penduline tits in 1996 and 1997. Remarkably for an inland site, it also attracts rare vagrant warblers, notably the aquatic warbler in 1955, Hume's warbler in 2004 and yellow-browed warblers in several winters since 1994; however, most significant was an Iberian chiffchaff on 3 June 1972, the first recorded in the UK. The current list of birds recorded at the reservoir numbers 253 species. The most recent species added to the list are Caspian gull (2015), Ring-necked duck (2017) and cattle egret (2018). =Insects= Many other forms of wildlife have also been studied and were documented in the Birds of Brent Reservoir.1 There have been 31 species of butterfly at the reservoir, including breeding marbled white and ringlet, the closest site for these to the centre of London. The most recent addition was brown argus in 2015. Scarce species include a single dark green fritillary in 1999. Prior to the construction of the reservoir, marsh fritillary used to breed. Dragonflies and damselflies have been studied and 15 species have been seen, of which 12 breed at the reservoir. View from Neasden Recreation Ground of swans on Brent Reservoir =Mammals= The small list of the mammals is documented in The Birds of Brent Reservoir. The grey squirrel and the red fox are common; the latter mostly nocturnal. Muntjac have been present since the beginning of the 21st century but are shy, their presence noted mainly by tracks, one or two are occasionally seen in daytime. The reservoir is notable for bats: noctule, Leisler's bat, serotine, Daubenton's bat and three species of pipistrelle were recorded in one day in September 2007. Regular bat detection evenings in 2008 have shown that Nathusius' pipistrelle is present. =Neasden Recreation Ground= Neasden Recreation Ground is a park of on the southern shore of the reservoir. It is mainly grassland with woods, a sports ground and a children's play area.Brent Council, Neasden Recreation Ground There is access from Aboyne Road and from the North Circular Road, opposite Brook Road and close to Staples Corner. =Welsh Harp Open Space= Welsh Harp Open Space is a park and nature reserve of on the north-west shore. It was established as a recreational area in 1965,London Borough of Brent, Welsh Harp Open Space and received a Green Flag Award for 2010‚Äì11. There is access from Birchen Grove. In the late 19th century, this area was served by the Welsh Harp railway station.

Conservators were appointed as early as the 13th century. History Pope Innocent IV presupposed their existence in the decree from which we first learn their power. Owing to abuses and complaints the Council of Trent limited their jurisdiction, but new controversies, often recurring, caused popes Clement VIII, Gregory XV, and Innocent X to define their privileges more precisely. Troubles continued to arise, especially concerning the conservators of religious orders. Pope Clement XIII decreed that in missionary countries such officials should no longer be chosen, but that all controversies should be referred to the Holy See. From that time forth conservators fell into practical desuetude. According to law, these officials were to be chosen from among the prelates or dignitaries of cathedral and collegiate churches; later from the synodal judges. When a conservator had been chosen by regular clergy he could not be removed for five years without cause. He had no jurisdiction in cases that required juridical examination. While he took of all complaints against regular clergy, he had no authority to receive those of the regular clergy against others unless they were notorious. In the latter case the conservator decided the question summarily. He could punish with ecclesiastical penalties even high church dignitaries who interfered with his duties. His power was limited, however, to the one diocese in which be had been elected, nor could the same conservator have power in several dioceses.

Huber studied in Franeker, Utrecht and Heidelberg. He started in 1657 - at a very young age - as professor of Eloquence and History at the University of Franeker and as of 1665 he became professor of law. From 1679 to 1682 he was a judge at the Court of Appeal of Friesland and thereafter returned his position as professor of law until his death in 1694. His major work, De jure civitatis libri tres, was published initially in 1672 and continued to be revised until 1694. Huber considered captivity in war, criminal conviction, voluntary renunciation of liberty, and birth from a female slave legal grounds for slavery. Apart from this work, he was internationally well known for his studies on Roman law. In the Netherlands he is also well known for his work Heedensdaegse Rechtsgeleertheyt soo elders, als in Friesland gebruikelijk (1686, 1768) (The Jurisprudence of My Time). In this work he presents a complete overview of the law system of Friesland at that time. In 1672 he became engaged in the public polemic about the Frisian constitution then raging in and around the States of Friesland with his pamphlet Spiegel Van Doleancie En Reformatie, Na den tegenwoordigen toestant des Vaderlandts (Mirror of Appeal and Reform, concerning the current situation of the Fatherland). Huber's short treatise on the conflict of laws, Conflictu Legum Diversarum in Diversis Imperiis, was a highly influential work, with a large impact on conflict of laws in English and American jurisprudence.Ernest G.

It was first completed in 1265, but the massive Baroque palace today occupying most of the site was built between 1749 and 1769. The complex in the past was referred to as either the Royal Palace () or the Royal Castle (, ). The castle now houses the Hungarian National Gallery and The Budapest History Museum. Buda Castle sits on the southern tip of Castle Hill, surrounded by the touristic area known as V√°rnegyed (Castle Quarter), which is famous for medieval, Baroque and Neoclassical houses, churches, public buildings, and monuments. The hill is linked to Clark √Åd√°m Square and the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge by the Castle Hill Funicular. The castle is a part of the Budapest World Heritage Site, so declared in 1987. The original Royal Palace was ruined during WWII, it was rebuilt in a simplified Stalin Baroque style during the K√°d√°r era. History left =Middle Ages= Buda Castle in the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493 Southern view of the Medieval Royal palace (1520s) The first royal residence on the Castle Hill was built by King B√©la IV of Hungary between 1247 and 1265. It is uncertain whether it was situated on the southern tip of the hill or on the northern elevation, near the Kammerhof. The oldest part of the present-day palace was built in the 14th century by Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, who was the younger brother of King Louis I of Hungary. Only the foundations remain of the castle keep, which was known as Stephen's Tower (Hungarian: Istv√°n-torony). The Gothic palace of King Louis I was arranged around a narrow courtyard next to the keep. King Sigismund significantly enlarged the palace and strengthened its fortifications. Sigismund, as a Holy Roman Emperor, needed a magnificent royal residence to express his prominence among the rulers of Europe. He chose Buda Castle as his main residence, and during his long reign it became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. Buda was an important artistic centre of the International Gothic style. Construction began in the 1410s and was largely finished in the 1420s, although some minor works continued until the death of the king in 1437. The palace was first mentioned in 1437, under the name \\"fricz palotha\\". The most important part of Sigismund's palace was the northern wing, known as the Fresh Palace (Hun: Friss-palota). On the top floor was a large hall called the Roman Hall () with a carved wooden ceiling. Great windows and balconies faced toward the city of Buda. The fa√ßade of the palace was decorated with statues, a and coat-of-arms. In front stood the bronze equestrian statue of Sigismund, later repaired by King Matthias Corvinus. The southern part of the royal residency was surrounded with narrow zwingers. Two parallel walls, the so-called \\"cortina walls\\", run down from the palace to the River Danube across the steep hillside. The most imposing structure, the Broken Tower (Hun: Csonka-torony), on the western side of the cour d'honneur, remained unfinished. The basement of the tower was used as a dungeon; the top floors were probably the treasury of the royal jewels. The last phase of large-scale building activity took place under King Matthias Corvinus. During the first decades of his reign the king finished the work on the Gothic palace. The Royal Chapel, with the surviving Lower Church, was likely built at that time. After the marriage of Matthias and Beatrice of Naples in 1476, Italian humanists, artists and craftsmen arrived at Buda. The Hungarian capital became the first centre of Renaissance north of the Alps. The king rebuilt the palace in an early Renaissance style. The cour d'honneur was modernised and an Italian loggia was added. Inside the palace were two rooms with golden ceilings: the Bibliotheca Corviniana and a passage with the frescoes of the twelve signs of the Zodiac. The fa√ßade of the palace was decorated with statues of John Hunyadi, L√°szl√≥ Hunyadi and King Matthias. In the middle of the court there was a fountain with a statue of Pallas Athene. Only fragments remain of this Renaissance palace: some red marble balustrades, lintels and decorative glazed tiles from stoves and floors. The reconstructed medieval fortifications and the Great Rondella In the last years of his reign Matthias Corvinus started construction of a new Renaissance palace on the eastern side of the Sigismund Courtyard, next to the Fresh Palace. The Matthias Palace remained unfinished because of the king's early death. The palace had a monumental red marble stairway in front of the fa√ßade. Matthias Corvinus was usually identified with Hercules by the humanists of his court; the bronze gates were decorated with panels depicting the deeds of Hercules, and a great bronze statue of the Greek hero welcomed the guests in the forecourt of the palace complex, where jousts were held. The walled gardens of the palace were laid out on the western slopes of the Castle Hill. In the middle of the enclosure, a Renaissance villa was built by Matthias. Only one column survives of this so-called Aula Marmorea. After the death of Matthias Corvinus, his successor, King Vladislaus II, carried on the works of the Matthias Palace, especially after his marriage with Anna of Foix-Candale in 1502. Under the reign of King John Z√°polya (the last national ruler of Hungary) the palace was repaired. On the southern tip of the Castle Hill, the Great Rondella was built by Italian military engineers. The circular bastion is one of the main surviving structure of the old palace. =Ottoman Era= left After the Battle of Moh√°cs, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary collapsed. The Ottoman Turks occupied the evacuated town on 11 September 1526. Although Buda was sacked and burned, the Royal Palace was not damaged. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent carried away all the bronze statues (the Hunyadis, Pallas Athene and Hercules) with him to Constantinople. The statues were destroyed there in a rebellion a few years later. The Sultan also took many volumes from the Corvina library. In 1529 the Ottoman army besieged and occupied Buda again, and the palace was badly damaged. On 29 August 1541 Buda was occupied again by the Ottomans, without any resistance. Buda became part of Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Eyalet of Budin. The original German and Hungarian population left the city, immigrants from Ottoman Empire and the Balkan peninsula came to their place.Oliver A. I. Botar : From European Capital to Ottoman Outpost: The Decline of Buda in the Sixteenth Century, (1987, Spring) LINK: Although Turkish travel writers wrote enthusiastically about the beauty of the palace of the Hungarian kings, the new Ottoman government let the palace decay. It was partially used as barracks a storage place and stables, and otherwise it stood empty. The palace was called I√ß Kala (\\"Inner Castle\\") and Hisar Pe√ße (\\"Citadel\\") by the Turks. The name of the cour d'honneur was \\"Seray meydani\\". The favourite nickname of the complex was \\"Palace of the Golden Apples\\".Holy League took Buda after a long siege in 1686 The economic decline of Buda the capital city during the Ottoman conquest characterised by the stagnation of population, the population of Buda was not larger in 1686, than the population of the city two centuries earlier in the 15th century. The Ottomans allowed the Hungarian royal place to fall into ruins. The amortised palace was later transformed into a gunpowder storage and magazine by the Ottomans, which caused its detonation during the siege in 1686. The original Christian Hungarian population didn't feel secure during the Ottoman conquest, their numbers significantly shrank in the next decades, due to their fleeing to the Habsburg ruled Royal Hungary. The proportion of the population who were of Jews and Gypsy families increased during the Ottoman rule in Buda. In the era between 1541 and 1686, the Habsburgs tried to re-capture Buda several times. Unsuccessful sieges in 1542, 1598, 1603 and 1684 caused serious damage. The Ottoman authorities repaired only the fortifications. According to 17th- century sources, many buildings of the former Royal Palace were roofless and their vaults collapsed. Nonetheless the medieval palace mostly survived until the great siege of 1686. =Destruction of the medieval castle= The great siege of Buda (1686); contemporary drawing The medieval palace was destroyed in the great siege of 1686 when Buda was captured by allied Christian forces. In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed Western European Christian campaign was started to take the city. This time the Holy League's army was much larger, consisting of 65,000‚Äì100,000 men, including German, Hungarian, Croat, Dutch, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers and other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen and officers. The Turkish defenders consisted of 7,000 men. In a heavy artillery bombardment, many buildings burned and collapsed. The Stephen's Tower, used as a gunpowder store by the Ottomans, exploded when hit by a single cannon, said to have been fired by a friar called G√°bor, also referred as T√ºzes G√°bor (\\"Gabriel Fiery\\"). According to contemporary sources, the explosion killed as many as 1,500 Turkish soldiers and caused a wave on the Danube that washed away artillery batteries and guards standing on the opposite shore. Habsburg military engineers made several plans and drawings of the buildings in subsequent decades. Although the walls mainly survived, the burned-out shell rapidly decayed from a lack of maintenance. Between 1702 and 1715, Stephen's Tower disappeared completely, and the palace was beyond repair. In 1715, King Charles III ordered the demolition of the ruins. Johann H√∂lbling surveyed the still-existing structures. The king ordered the surviving marble statues, antiquities, inscriptions and coins should be spared (there is no evidence about the realization of the royal decree). The main part of the palace and the Broken Tower were totally demolished, the hollows and moats were filled and a new flat terrace was established. The southern fortifications, zwingers and rooms were buried under tons of rubbish and earth. =Early Baroque palace= The royal castle built under King Charles III (1733) In 1715 a small Baroque palace was built according to the plans of Johann H√∂lbling. It was a simple rectangular building, with an inner court and a shorter side wing, which was later demolished. The H√∂lbling palace is identical with the core of the present-day palace, where the Baroque Court of the Budapest Historical Museum is now located. The interior of the palace was left unfinished when work stopped in 1719. The Hofkriegsrat commissioned Fortunato di Prati to make several plans for the palace, but lack of money hindered their implementation. In 1723 the palace was accidentally burned down and the windows were walled up in order to stop further deterioration. Several drawings from the 1730s and 1740s show the unfinished decaying shell of the simple two-storey blockhouse. Some engravings show an idealised finished version which never existed. Sometime around 1730 the roof was repaired. =Era of Maria Theresa= left In 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich, President of the Hungarian Chamber, appealed to the public to finish the derelict palace by means of public subscription. Palatine J√°nos P√°lffy called upon the counties and cities to award grants for the project. The moment was favourable because relations between the Hungarian nobility and the Habsburgs were exceptionally good. The Hungarians supported Queen Maria Theresa in the dire need of the War of the Austrian Succession. The queen was grateful for this, and the new Royal Palace became the symbol of peace and friendship between the dynasty and the nation. The plans of the splendid, U-shaped Baroque palace with a cour d'honneur were drawn by Jean Nicolas Jadot, chief architect of the Viennese court. After 1753 the plans were modified by his successor, Nicolaus Pacassi. Ign√°c Oraschek, master builder, who guided the works, and modified the plans according to his own ideas. The foundation stone of the palace was laid on 13 May 1749, which was the Queen's birthday. The work continued at a good pace until 1758, when financial difficulties caused a seven-year break. By that time only the interiors were left unfinished.The fa√ßade of the cour d'honneur constructed under Hillebrandt in the 1760s According to surviving historical documents, the layout of the palace followed Jadot's signed plans of 1749. The fa√ßades, some interior elements and the St. Sigismund Chapel are the works of Nicol√≤ Pacassi, while the special double false domes were probably planned by Oraschek, formerly the master builder of Count Grassalkovich. Double false domes were typical features of the so-called Grassalkovich-type Baroque castles like G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. However, this feature was later removed from the palace. In 1764 the Queen visited the palace and allotted 20,000 thalers a year for the work, which recommenced in 1765 according to the plans of Franz Anton Hillebrandt. Hillebrand altered the cour d'honneur fa√ßade of the central wing in Rococo style. In 1769 the St. Sigismund Chapel was consecrated and the palace was finished the same year. According to the aggregate statement of Grassalkovich, the costs were 402,679 forints. =Nuns and scholars= The future of the complex was uncertain; the Queen had no intention to use it as a royal residence, because she did not spend much time in Buda. In 1769 she gave one wing to the Sisters of Loreto, who came from Sankt P√∂lten. The building was handed over on 13 May 1770, but the elegant Baroque rooms were considered unsuitable for a nunnery. Alexander Keglevich, rector of the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University,Ungarische Revue, Volume 11, S.53, Magyar Tudom√°nyos Akad√©mia, Franklin-Verein, 1891. had provided financing to Maria Theresa, which supposedly should have been repaid, according to her letters to her children and friends.Briefe an ihre Kinder und Freunde; Verfasser/in: Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria; Alfred Ritter von Arneth, Verlag: Braum√ºller, Wien 1881. In 1777 the Queen decided that the University of Nagyszombat should move to Buda. The nuns moved out and the palace was hastily adapted to use as a university. The work was guided by Farkas Kempelen and led to classrooms, teacher's cabinets, museums, a library and a university press being built. In the front, the false dome was removed and a four-storey observatory tower, planned by Alfred Hillebrandt or Karl Georg Zillack, was erected. In 1778 Hillebrandt built a new chapel for the first king of Hungary, Saint Stephen's, the mummified right hand, which was recovered by Queen Maria Theresa from the Republic of Ragusa in 1771.Europe's centre around AD 1000, Volume 1, page 7, Council of Europe, Art Exhibition, Alfried Wieczorek, Hans-Martin Hinz, Theiss, 2000. Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá, page 54, ≈Ωeljko Brnetiƒá, ≈†kolska knjiga, 1990. The Chapel of the Holy Right was situated near the St Sigismund Chapel, in the middle of an inner court. The outer form was octagonal and the inside was oval, crowned by a dome. The altar-piece was painted by Joseph Hauzinger. The ribbon-cutting ceremony of the university was held on 25 June 1780, the 40th anniversary of the coronation of the Queen. The throne room became a splendid aula decorated with frescoes depicting the four faculties. In 1953, two grisaille frescoes were discovered on the shorter sides of the room. =Residence of the Palatines= Palatine of Hungary, resided in the castle. Functional problems of the university remained unresolved, which led to the faculties being moved to Pest in 1783. In 1791 the palace became the residence of the new Habsburg palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary, Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria. After the early death of the palatine in 1795, his younger brother Archduke Joseph succeeded him, followed by Archduke Stephen. The palatinal court in Buda Castle was the centre of fashionable life and high society in the Hungarian capital. In 1810 the palatinal palace was damaged by fire, but in the next decades, plans were made to raise the building with an upper storey, but they were not implemented, although the observatory tower, which hindered the work, was removed. In 1838 the crypt of the St. Sigismund Chapel was rebuilt according to the plans of Franz H√ºppmann: the Palatinal Crypt was the burial place of Palatine Joseph and his family. The crypt is the only part of the palace that survived the Second World War. Palatine Joseph established gardens on the southern and eastern hillsides of the Castle Hill according to the plans of Antal Tost. The gardens of Buda Castle were among the most famous English-style landscape gardens in Hungary. Palatine Stephen left the palace on 23 September 1848 when a break between the liberal Hungarian government and the dynasty became inevitable. On 5 January Buda was occupied by the Austrian army led by Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr√§tz. The chief commander lodged in the royal palace. On 4 May 1849, the Hungarian army, led by Art√∫r G√∂rgey, laid siege on Buda Castle, which was being defended by General Heinrich Hentzi. On 20 May the Hungarians captured Buda with an assault. The palace was the last stronghold of the Austrian troops, and became a site of heavy artillery fighting. The ensuing fire consumed the central and southern wings; they were completely burned out and their interiors were destroyed. =Era of Franz Joseph= Buda Castle before its remodeling in the 1880s The palace was rebuilt between 1850 and 1856 by Josef Weiss and Carl Neuwirth. The 13-axis central wing was raised with a third storey and a squat attic-tower. The central risalit was decorated with a balcony of six colossal columns. With these changes, the former Viennese Baroque palace of Maria Theresa became considered a more austere Neoclassical Baroque building. The ballroom was redecorated with marbles and stuccoes. After 1853 stately rooms were designed in a French Rococo style, with white-gold stuccoes and furniture from the Hofburg. The palace was already too small for the needs of the royal court, so the kitchens and service rooms were housed in the neighbouring Zeughaus. The palace was connected with the Zeughaus by a glassed passageway. On the western side of the cour d'honneur two smaller buildings were erected, using plans by Weiss and Neuwirth in 1854. The two-storey St√∂ckl housed the apartments of the archdukes and imperial officials, whereas the Wachlokal was built for the royal guards.left Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria visited Buda Castle in 1856 and 1857. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Franz Joseph was crowned king of Hungary. The palace played an important part in the lavish ceremony and was a symbol of peace between the dynasty and the nation. In the last decades of the 19th century Budapest experienced rapid economic development. Ambitious urban planning projects were carried out to express the growing wealth and higher status of the Hungarian capital, with special attention being paid to the rebuilding of Buda Castle. The autonomous Hungarian government intended to create a royal palace to match any famous European royal residence (especially their old rival, Vienna's Hofburg). The rebuilding spanned forty years, between 1875 and 1912, and caused sweeping changes in topography of the entire area. First the V√°rkert-baz√°r (Royal Garden Pavilion) was built on the embankment of the Danube, at the foot of the Castle Hill, between 1875 and 1882. This Neo-Renaissance gateway was designed by a Hungarian architect named Mikl√≥s Ybl. The structure was an open arcade, with pavilions, stairways and ramps, and two blocks of flats. Ybl also built a new waterworks pumping station, named V√°rkert-kioszk (Royal Garden Kiosk), and two stair towers against the medieval cortina walls. The southern stair tower followed French Renaissance style, resembling a small turreted castle, while the northern stair tower was similar to a Gothic brick donjon (a fortified main tower from a castle, also called a keep). Only V√°rkert-baz√°r and V√°rkert- kioszk survive currently. The Danube terrace with Eugene of Savoy's monument In 1882 Prime Minister K√°lm√°n Tisza charged Ybl with drawing a master plan for rebuilding the palace. In his 1885 plan, Ybl preserved the old Baroque palace, but mirrored it on the western side of the cour d'honneur, which doubled the size of the residence. He also planned a new carriageway on the western hillside, demolishing the medieval walls and towers of the √öjvil√°g-kert terrace. The narrowness of the natural plateau of the Castle Hill meant there was not enough space for the new Krisztinav√°ros wing, which Ybl solved by erecting a substructure down to the foot of the hill. The monumental western fa√ßade sits on this windowless, three-storey high substructure. The whole block covered almost the entire hill, but the main fa√ßade on the cour d'honneur had the same modest height as the Baroque palace. The fa√ßade was clad with stone slabs, while the old parts are stuccoed; hence, the difference between the original Baroque and the Neo-Renaissance wings is obvious. The formerly open cour d'honneur became a closed court with an arched gateway, guarded by the four lions of the sculptor, J√°nos Fadrusz. The court is called Lions Court (or Oroszl√°nos udvar). Royal procession in the western courtyard (1880s) The work began on 1 May 1890, but Ybl died on 22 January 1891. His successor, Alajos Hauszmann, slightly modified the plans of the Krisztinav√°ros wing. In 1896 the building reached the level of the court, and King Franz Joseph ceremoniously laid down the foundation stone of the palace, which was soon completed. In 1893, the 25th anniversary of King Franz Joseph's coronation was celebrated in the Royal Palace. However, the old banqueting hall proved to be too small, so Hauszmann enlarged the room by knocking down and reconstructing the wall towards the cour d'honneur (which additionally had the Hillebrandt fa√ßade). In spite of this expansion and Ybl's new wing, the palace was still deemed insufficient for great royal celebrations, so another round of construction began. The north wing, standing on the site of the old Zeughaus, was completely designed by Hauszmann. The architect doubled the Baroque palace on the Danube side, generally imitating its traditional architectural style. At the meeting point of the old and the new wings, a colonnaded portico was erected, with a lavishly-decorated tympanum (with allegorical statues by K√°roly Sennyey) and a flight of stairs called the Habsburg Stairs. The whole palace was crowned with a dome with a copy of the Crown of St. Stephen at its apex. The dome, like other details of the north wing, shows German Jugendstil influences, as does the rear fa√ßade towards the western forecourt. This forecourt also contains the Matthias Fountain (Hungarian: M√°ty√°s k√∫tja) by sculptor Alajos Str√≥bl. Above the main gate, towards Szent Gy√∂rgy t√©r, stood a statue of the Goddess Hungaria. This side was the main fa√ßade of the complex, but it was much shorter and less characteristic than the long Danube fa√ßade. The old Chapel of the Holy Right was demolished to make room for a carriageway. left Hauszmann designed a new riding school in the former √öjvil√°g terrace, which was now named the Csik√≥s court, after the Csik√≥s statue of Gy√∂rgy Vastagh (now in the western forecourt). In front of the long Danube fa√ßade, an equestrian statue was erected in honour of Prince Eugene of Savoy, the victorious leader of the Habsburg army in the Battle of Zenta. The eastern forecourt was closed off with a lavish wrought-iron rail, which ended in a pillar crowned by a statue of the legendary Turul, the sacred bird of the Magyars, spreading its wings above Budapest. Two flights of stairs led up to the Szent Gy√∂rgy t√©r, which was on much higher ground. In the western forecourt, Hauszmann designed a new neo-Baroque guardhouse and rebuilt the old Royal Stables. The Royal Gardens on the southern hillside were famous for their precious plants, glass houses and picturesque terraces. In the middle of the gardens stood the Swiss House of Queen Elisabeth, furnished with Hungarian folk art objects. The house was built above the ruins of the medieval gatehouse, partially making use of them. The interior of the palace was decorated and furnished exclusively with works of the leading Hungarian artists of the age. The Royal Palace was officially inaugurated in 1912. Contemporary critics praised it as the most outstanding Hungarian building of the turn of the 20th century. =Interbellum years and World War II= View of the dome and the terrace with Prince Eugene's monument (1926) The Hauszmann palace existed for around three decades: on 30 December 1916, the building played a part in the coronation ceremony of the last Hungarian king, Charles IV of Hungary. After the 1918 revolution and the removal of the Habsburg dynasty, the Royal Palace became the seat of the new regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, Mikl√≥s Horthy. Horthy lived in the Krisztinav√°ros wing with his family between the years of 1920 and 1944. In this era the palace was the centre of Hungarian political and social life. Famous guests entertained by Horthy in the palace included King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy in 1937 and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) in 1938.leftOn 16 October 1944 a Nazi German commando unit, led by Otto Skorzeny, occupied the Royal Palace and forced the regent to abdicate. Buda Castle was the last major stronghold of Budapest held by Axis forces during the siege of Budapest between 29 December 1944 and 13 February 1945. The German and Hungarian forces defending the castle attempted to break the Soviet blockade on 11 February 1945, but failed. Allegedly the Soviet Red Army knew about their plans and had aimed heavy weapons at the possible escape routes hours earlier. This is considered one of the biggest disasters of Hungarian military history. Heavy fights and artillery fire rendered the palace into ruins. The furniture vanished, roofs and vaults collapsed and the southern and western wings were burned out. The destruction was comparable to that of the great siege of 1686. =Reconstruction= Immediately after the war, archeological research was begun in order to unearth the remains of the medieval castle. The research, led by L√°szl√≥ Ger≈ë (1946‚Äì1966) and L√°szl√≥ Zolnay (1967‚Äì1979), was likely the biggest castle excavation in Europe. The former Royal Gardens stairways, pavilions and glass houses, which dated from the turn of the 20th century, had to be sacrificed. Important parts of the former Sigismund and Matthias Palace had survived under the thick earth fill. The burned-out ruins of the Royal Palace and the Chain Bridge (1946) The first reconstruction plan of the medieval remains was written by L√°szl√≥ Ger≈ë in 1950 and finalised in 1952. The reconstruction work was finished in 1966. Contrary to the generally accepted principles of historic reconstruction, the medieval fortification system was rebuilt in its entirety. Important elements like the 16th century Great Rondella and the medieval Gatehouse, the Mace Tower, the walls and the zwingers were reconstructed according to the results of the archaeological research and contemporary pictorial evidence. The low-lying southern wing of the Gothic palace was also reconstructed, together with the vaulted Gothic Hall and the Lower Church of the former Royal Chapel. Medieval- style gardens were planted in the zwingers. The foundation of the Stephen's Tower was unearthed, but as archaeological evidence was lacking, the tower was not reconstructed. The remains of the Broken Tower were covered again. The large-scale reconstruction of the medieval fortifications substantially changed the cityscape of Budapest. At the time it was considered a highly successful project, reconciling historical authenticity with urban-planning demands. In the 1970s, archeological research continued on the northern and western side of the palace, led by L√°szl√≥ Zolnay. It produced many important achievements, including the Late Gothic Buda Castle Statues. The Karakash Pasha Tower, in the √öjvil√°g Garden, was a Turkish-era tower demolished at the end of the 19th century. Photographic evidence enabled its reconstruction, but the new tower was only a copy of the original, and the details are not considered authentic. =Modernization= The modernist dome designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961. Vast amounts of art work and sculpture on the exterior and almost all of the interior that survived the war were intentionally destroyed during the postwar reconstruction. The government made a decision about reconstruction only in 1948. According to contemporary photos, all the important interiors were in a damaged state, but their reconstruction was technically possible. The new communist government of Hungary considered the Royal Palace a symbol of the former regime. Therefore, Hungarian leaders chose to thoroughly modernise the interior and exterior of the palace. Architectural trends played a part in the decision, as modernist architects had condemned the Hauszmann style as \\"too ornate\\". The first modernist reconstruction plan was made by architect Istv√°n Jan√°ky in 1950. His controversial concept was later modified. In 1952 the Hungarian government asked for help from Poland, because they had successfully rebuilt Warsaw and, indeed, other cities. A delegation of Polish experts, led by the architectural historian Jan Zachwatowicz, proposed the rebuilding of the Hauszmann palace.left During the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the remaining interior, including the rooms and halls that were undamaged, were destroyed. Important exterior details, such as the main entrance, the Habsburg Steps, the dome, the Royal Stables, the guardhouse and the riding school were demolished, and the remaining fa√ßades were simplified. In Lions Court the ornate gates of King's Stairs and Diplomat's Stairs were demolished. The doorway of the castle church disappeared, as did the chapel. The detailed Neo-Baroque roofs were simplified and plain new windows were installed. The allegorical sculpture group of the tympanum was destroyed. At the same time however, medieval elements that were uncovered were reconstructed in what was thought their appearance was. No precise drawings existed of the medieval elements, therefore an approximate reconstruction of their appearance was done. The modernist dome was designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961 after Italian Baroque models. The palace was rebuilt by 1966, but the interior spaces were ready only in the 1980s. Buda Castle became a cultural centre, home to three museums and the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library. =21st century= In March 2006 the National Office of Cultural Heritage finalised the long-term development plan of Buda Castle. Asserting that the modernisation in 1952‚Äì66 caused irreversible damage, they proposed the partial reconstruction of the fa√ßades, including the dome and the Habsburg Steps. No decision has been reached about the realization of the development plan. On 25 July 2007 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny chose the medieval King's Cellar in Buda Castle as the place to announce the list of the \\"most important public works projects\\", which was financed by European Union funds between 2007 and 2013. In 2008 an international consortium began to build an underground garage for 700 cars under the former Csik√≥s Court. The developer was granted permission to demolish a section of the 15th-century castle wall. The demolition was carried out in spite of criticism from archeologists and the public. The area had been previously excavated by archeologists, who discovered many important finds, including medieval children's toys and a tooth from the pet leopard of King Matthias Corvinus. Additionally, the area outside the inner walls was used as a garbage dump during the 15th‚Äì17th centuries. However, financial difficulties interrupted the construction of the garage in 2009; work resumed for a short time in November 2011 but stopped again after the completion of the concrete basement slab. The government granted 1.3 billion forint for the completion of the project in 2015 after the half-built garage was bought by the state. The castle courtyard was also used as the setting for Katy Perry's 2010 music video, \\"Firework\\", part of her Teenage Dream album. The government formulated the \\"National Hauszmann Program\\" to revitalize and restore the castle in the period of 2019‚àí2021. The program is named in honour of Alajos Hauszmann, the last major architect of the castle.https://nemzetihauszmannprogram.hu/ Medieval wing In 1958‚Äì1962, architect L√°szl√≥ Ger≈ë partially recreated the fa√ßades of the Gothic castle facing the narrow southern, western and eastern courts. Only the ground and first floors were reconstructed; the castle was originally much higher. The unfinished fa√ßade stops at the level of the Baroque terrace above, with two windows opening towards the southern court and another two opening towards the eastern court. The four almost-identical windows are square, four-panel stone constructions of very fine Gothic craftsmanship, with their outer frames decorated with small columns. One window, which had been walled up, was discovered in situ during archeological research, and the others were reconstructed from fragments by the sculptor Ern≈ë Szak√°l by means of anastylosis. The ground floor openings are simpler. An arched stone doorway gives access to the southern court from the cellar under the Gothic Hall. The fa√ßade was originally plastered. The whitewashed surface was decorated with a painted pattern in a rusty hue, resembling rustication. Fragments of painted geometrical decoration, a common feature on the medieval buildings of Buda, were discovered on the eastern fa√ßade, but it was not restored. A Gothic balcony tower projects from the wall at the end of the eastern fa√ßade. Its reconstruction was a much debated issue, because the balcony tower goes above the level of the Baroque terrace, disturbing the harmonious panorama of the palace. On the other hand, it clearly indicates that there are higher, missing floors. The balcony tower is a two-storey structure standing on a wide stone basement. The first floor is a solid stone wall without any openings and the niche behind it belongs to the Gothic Hall. The second floor has a balcony with three windows; it is now closed off by a glass wall. Originally it would have been part of an important ceremonial room. The balcony is in the shape of half an octagon. The three Gothic double lancet windows are considered the most important architectural elements of the tower and the profiles; frames and mullions were restored in a simplified form, using many of the original stones. The tower is covered with a flat metal roof. The Gothic Hall is connected to Stephen's Castle (Istv√°n v√°r) on the western side. It was named after Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, the younger brother of King Louis I of Hungary. Built in the 1340s‚Äì1370s, it is the oldest part of the medieval royal palace. Only the foundation and three interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms survive. Stephen's Tower (Istv√°n torony) was the keep of Stephen's Castle. However, it was destroyed by an explosion in 1686. The ground floor walls were discovered a little time after 1946. It was a square building (11.7 √ó 11.1 m), built upon the rock surface of Castle Hill. The walls are 2.31 to 2.7 m thick with narrow arrowslits on the southern, western and northern sides. The original doorway, on the eastern side, was walled up after the Gothic Hall was built in the 15th century. Stephen's Tower was originally a free-standing structure, sited differently from later buildings. The triangle in front of it was walled up to create a continuous southern fa√ßade for the palace. During post-war reconstruction, this part of the fa√ßade (with a broken stone doorway) was not reconstructed. A vaulted room (6.2 √ó 6.3 m) on the ground floor was still intact in 1820, according to a contemporary drawing. Although the ribs, corbels and key stone were discovered during archeological research, the room was not reconstructed. A spiral stairway had connected the room with the missing higher floors. The remaining part of the Stephen's Castle (with the barrel-vaulted rooms behind) has a simple stone fa√ßade with a Gothic doorway. The pointed arch was later restored. Interior The interior from the time of Maria Theresa and Franz Joseph was mostly destroyed during World War II and the post-war reconstruction, excluding the Palatinal Crypt, which survived both. Little information exists about the interiors from the medieval and Baroque eras, but the palace built at the turn of the 20th century was meticulously recorded, using detailed descriptions, photographic documentation and grounds plans. Architect Alajos Hauszmann said about the royal apartments: \\"I created a long series of rooms, longer than any similar royal apartments in continental Europe except Versailles.\\" A series of rooms from the medieval castle were unearthed and reconstructed during the post-war rebuilding of Buda Castle in 1958‚Äì62. They are now part of the permanent exhibition of the Budapest History Museum in \\"Building E\\" of Buda Castle. =Medieval period= Architectural context Only a fragment of the medieval castle survived the destruction of 1686‚Äì1715. The surviving rooms are not considered the most important ones; and none of the more famous rooms and buildings mentioned in the medieval sources exist today. The rooms which were unearthed after 1946 were only saved by chance and by their geographical position at a lower level than the newly created Baroque terrace. The Gothic Hall and the Palace Chapel were built by King Sigismund Luxemburg at the beginning of the 15th century. The castle wing is surrounded by a complex system of medieval fortifications. Castle chapel The lower chapel of the medieval castle The first chapel in the castle was probably built in the 14th century during the reign of Louis I of Hungary. Eberhard Windecke claimed in his Chronicle that Charles II of Hungary was murdered in 1386 in a room from which the royal chapel could be seen. The chapel was again mentioned in the Chronicle of Lorenzo de Monacis, which was written around 1390. King Sigismund of Luxemburg thoroughly rebuilt the old Anjou castle during the first decades of the 15th century. He erected a Gothic church in place of the former chapel. The Anjou castle's fa√ßade was now facing towards the inner palace courtyard, and the long chancel was projecting from the eastern side of the palace. The chancel was built upon a lower church due to a lack of space on the narrow plateau. The church had a nave and an chancel. The flamboyant Royal Church of Buda Castle was similar to the more famous Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. Archeological research proved the date of the church, because 15th-century strata were discovered under the intact brick floor of the lower church.L√°szl√≥ Zolnay: A budai v√°r, Bp: 1981, p. 60 In November 1489, Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire sent the relics of John the Almoner to King Matthias Corvinus. The King placed the relics in the Royal Chapel, which was re-dedicated and embellished with Renaissance furniture. In 1526, Buda was plundered by the Ottoman Turks after the Battle of Moh√°cs. The relics were rescued in time and carried to Pressburg, where they are still kept currently. A surviving church inventory from 1530 shows a wealth of furnishings. Later, King J√°nos Szapolyai converted the lower church into a bastion. The large Gothic windows were walled up; and only the rectangular arrow slits were left open. In 1541 the Ottoman Turks captured Buda without resistance, and the Royal Church ceased to be a place of Christian worship. The upper church was destroyed in the 1686 siege of Buda, and the ruins were demolished in 1715. The vault of the lower church collapsed, and the interior was filled with rubbish. The remains were then buried under the new Baroque terrace for two centuries. The ruins of the lower church were discovered by archeologists in 1949‚Äì50. The remains were buried in 1953 because of conceptional disputes about the possible reconstruction. The chapel, finally reconstructed by 1963, was re-consecrated in 1990. Gothic Hall The Gothic Hall is one of the most important surviving examples of secular Gothic architecture in Central Europe. It was built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg in the early 15th century as an extension of the earlier Anjou palace. It was built on the southern edge of the natural rock plateau of Castle Hill. The level difference between the plateau and the southern court was about . A vaulted cellar was built under the hall to span this difference. The Gothic Hall is an irregular rectangle of , with a closed niche on the eastern side, which is the inside of the balcony tower. It is divided into two naves with Gothic rib vaults. The vaults are supported by two massive pillars which come up through the floor from the cellar beneath the room, and in addition, half-pillars in the corners support the ribs. All six vaults are quadripartite, and the two on the inner side are irregularly shaped. The hall has four windows, two on the southern side and two on the eastern side, with stone benches in the window niches. The Hall was connected to the palace through a door in the northern wall, supposedly on the place of the original doorway. The northern section of the floor is three steps higher. Buda Castle in the Middle Ages, from the Chronicles of Hartmann Schedel. The castle church, dedicated to St. John the Almoner, is indicated by the blue rectangle.All the newly built side walls were plastered and painted white, while the original stone surfaces were left uncovered. The ribs, pillars, arches and window niches were restored by sculptor Ern≈ë Szak√°l in 1961‚Äì62. The ribs have a simple profile, but fragments of a more complicated type were also found in the rubble, together with keystones. These pieces supposedly belonged to another stately hall situated above the room, but they were built into the reconstructed vaults by restorers in the 20th-century. The northern pillar of the Gothic Hall was already discovered by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century. The remains were buried under the outbuildings of the Royal Gardens, and Hauszmann protected the medieval pillar by building a brick shaft around it. Barrel-vaulted rooms Three interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms belong to the oldest part of the palace, Stephen's Castle, which was built by Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, in the 14th century. The northern room is larger () than the southern ones (). The northern room is covered by an east-west axial vault while the southern rooms have north-south axial vaults. The southern room is connected to the inner courtyard by a doorway. There is a small window high on the western wall. The middle room has a similar window. The larger northern room has three slit windows, one facing west and two facing north, all had iron rails. The rooms were connected to each other with carved Gothic corbel doors. The walls were originally plastered. In the southern room, a medieval stairway led to a trapdoor and a medieval toilet hidden in the empty space between the walls of the castle and the keep. The barrel vaulted rooms were supposedly used as a prison in the Middle Ages. Later the southern vaults collapsed. The intact barrel vault of the northern room was broken by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century when he filled the cellar with rubble. The barrel-vaulted rooms were restored in 1958‚Äì1962. Albrecht Cellar A medieval cellar north of the barrel-vaulted rooms, later called Albrecht pince (Albrecht Cellar), is covered with a Gothic brick barrel vault. The walls are blackened from burning. The cellar was probably built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg as the Cisterna Regia, i.e. the great underground cistern of the palace. The Cisterna Regia was situated under the former northern zwinger of the palace. This small rectangular courtyard became a private royal garden during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The private garden was an early Renaissance giardino segreto (hidden garden). It was designed by architect Chimenti Camicia in the 1470s. A well in the middle of the garden was fed by the cistern underneath. The hidden garden, the well and the cistern survived the 1686 siege of Buda. They were indicated on the plans of the area drawn by military architect Joseph de Ha√ºy in 1687. In 1715‚Äì1724 the former Cisterna Regia became the cellar of the new Baroque palace. A section of this room was later used as an ice chamber. King's Cellar The King's Cellar (Kir√°ly pince) is not a medieval structure, but a Baroque-era brick cellar under the Danube side of Building E. It was filled with tons of earth and rubble, and the original eastern fa√ßade of the medieval royal palace survived under the fill. The inner walls of the Baroque palace were actually built upon the old fa√ßade. Only the basement section of the original fa√ßade remained. This wing was built by King Sigismund of Luxenburg in the early 15th century and was rebuilt by King Matthias Corvinus 50 years later. The surviving eastern fa√ßade was built from large, finely carved blocks of stone. It followed the contour of Castle Hill with a break in the middle. A buttress was added and a rectangular tower with two buttresses on its corners. The lower part of a balcony on the tower was reconstructed, with three elegant Gothic corbels decorated with cusps. It was not possible to demolish the King's Cellar because the whole Baroque palace was resting upon it; the inner fill was removed in 1961. The medieval fa√ßade was reconstructed inside the cellar space between 1961 and 1965. Large windows were cut in the outer wall of the cellar to let in the daylight. Currently, the architectural history of the palace is discernible by viewing the interwoven layers of the past. On 25 July 2007 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny chose the King's Cellar as the place to announce the list of the \\"most important public works projects\\", financed by European Union funds between 2007 and 2013. = Baroque and Historicism =  Old ceremonial rooms  The old ceremonial rooms were as follows: = \\"Zenta\\" Room = The Zenta Room The \\"Zenta\\" Room (\\"Zenta\\" el≈ëterem) was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the audience antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the central wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the large painting of the Battle of Zenta contained therein. = Audience Antechamber = The Audience Antechamber The Audience Antechamber (Fogad√°si v√°r√≥terem) was situated north of the ballroom on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called Antichambre Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin (\\"Her Majesty the Empress' Antechamber\\"). The room gave access to Maria Theresa's private apartments from the ballroom. In the early 1900s, the audience antechamber became part of the ceremonial apartments and had the same white- golden Rococo stucco decoration as the white antechamber on the other side. = Grand Throne Room = The Grand Throne Room (c. 1894) The Grand Throne Room (Nagy tr√≥nterem), formerly known as the ballroom (Nagyterem), on the first floor of the Baroque wing had several layers of Baroque decoration from the second half of the 18th and the 19th century. Two surviving drawings record the oldest form of the room. Jakob Schmutzer's drawing from 1777 shows the opening ceremony of the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University after it was moved to the palace. The room had a Late Baroque decoration with double grooved Corinthian pilasters between the windows and stucco garlands. The walls were decorated with Vinzenz Fischer's frescoes of the four faculties. J√≥zsef Pollencig's drawing from 1795 shows a ball scene in the \\"Prunksaal\\". The pilasters were kept, but the frescoes were already covered, and the whole room was stuccoed. On the vault the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary can be seen. After the destruction of the 1849 siege, the room was redecorated in Neo-Baroque style. In 1892 the old ballroom was rebuilt with a new ceiling and a gallery towards the Lions Court; three of its side walls were preserved. It was enlarged again after 1896. The function of the ballroom was given to another new hall and this room was converted into the main throne hall instead. In the early 1900s, the room had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with three large chandeliers. Vinzenz Fischer's frescoes were re-discovered in 1953 during the post-war reconstruction. In spite of this, all the decoration layers were destroyed. Today it houses the Gothic altar collection of the Hungarian National Gallery. = White Antechamber = The White Antechamber The White Antechamber (Feh√©r el≈ëterem) is on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated south of the throne room. In the Baroque era it was called Zweytes Antichambre (\\"second antechamber\\"). In the early 1900s it had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a white Rococo stove. = \\"Coronation\\" Room = The Coronation Room The \\"Coronation\\" Room (\\"Koron√°z√°s\\" el≈ëterem), also on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the white antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the southern wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the painting of Franz Joseph I's coronation as King of Hungary after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.  Old royal apartments  The old royal apartments are as follows: = Small Throne Room = The Small Throne Room The Small Throne Room (Kis tr√≥nterem), which was situated next to the Audience Antechamber on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called Audienz-Zimmer and was part of the Empress' private apartments. In Hauszmann's time it was converted into the throne room of the palace, with a simple Baroque throne under a baldachin. It had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo cocklestove. = \\"Circle\\" Tearoom = The \\"Circle\\" Tearoom The \\"Circle\\" Tearoom (\\"Circle\\" teaszalon) was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and situated next to the small throne room, in the corner of the southern wing. In the Baroque era it was called Gesellschaft Zimmer Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin (\\"Her Majesty the Empress' Parlour\\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo cocklestove. The furniture consisted of a Rococo parlour suite. = Antechamber = Antechamber, former dressing room of the Queen The Antechamber was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated next to the \\"circle\\" tearoom with two windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called Ankleide- Zimmer Ihrer Majest√§t der Kaiserin (\\"Her Majesty the Empress' Dressing Room\\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. It was connected to another small room, the Frauen Kammer. In Hauszmann's time the walls were largely clad with wallpaper. The furniture consisted of a Rococo cocklestove, chairs and paintings. The last small room of the Empress, the former Schreib cabinet (\\"writing room\\"), with one window opening on to the Danube, later became a simple passageway. = Smoking Room = The Smoking Salon, former bedchamber of Queen Maria Theresa The Smoking Room (Doh√°nyz√≥ szalon) was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated in the middle of the Danube side of the old palace. In the Baroque era it was called Schlafzimmer Ihrer k.k. Majest√§ten (\\"The Imperial Couple's Bedroom\\"). It was the only common room of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I. In the early 1900s, the walls were largely hung with wallpaper. The furniture consisted of a Rococo parlour suite and paintings. In the old imperial apartments only the ceilings had the typically white-golden stucco decoration, used in the old ceremonial apartments. = Writing Room = The Writing Room The Writing Room (√çr√≥szoba) was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was formerly part of the private apartments of Francis I. One window opened to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called Ankleidecabinet S.M. des Kaisers (\\"Emperor's Dressing Room\\"). It was connected to another small room, the second dressing room. Later, the imperial dressing room was divided with a wall; with half being converted into a simple passageway, the other into a small writing room. In the early 1900s the latter's walls were largely clad with a very ornate Rococo wallpaper. It had a white marble mantelpiece with a large Rococo mirror above. = Parlour = The Parlour The Parlour (T√°rsalkod√≥ terem), on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was part of the private apartments of Francis I. It was situated in the corner of the southern wing with 2+3 windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era the room was divided with a wall, one half named Empfangs Zimmer S.M. des Kaisers (\\"Imperial Audience Room\\"), the other Arbeits Cabinet (\\"Study\\"). In Hauszmann's time, it was converted to a great parlour with wallpaper clad walls, a Rococo cocklestove, a chandelier, paintings, chairs and a mirror. = Antechamber = last Antechamber The Antechamber, on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was the last room of the former private apartments of Francis I. In the Baroque era it was called Zweytes Audienz Zimmer (\\"second audience room\\"). In Hauszmann's time the walls were mainly clad with wallpaper, and it had a Rococo cocklestove, a chandelier, paintings and chairs. South Wing The rooms of the south wing are as follows: = Baroque Court = The Baroque Court (Barokk udvar), a rectangular court, which is the oldest part of the Baroque palace. Here the original 18‚Äì19th century fa√ßades survived, and in 1997 the court was covered with a glass roof and became the main exhibition hall of the Budapest History Museum. = King's Staircase = Entrance to the King's Staircase The King's Staircase (Kir√°ly-l√©pcs≈ë), the Baroque main staircase of the southern wing gave access to the private apartments of Emperor Francis I. Both the King's Staircase and its northern twin, the Diplomat's Staircase, had ornate gates opening onto Lions Court, decorated with telamons. The kitchens were originally situated on the ground floor of the southern wing, but they were relocated by Hauszmann.  Central Wing  The central wing had the following rooms: = Diplomat's Staircase = The Diplomat's Staircase (Diplomata-l√©pcs≈ë) was the Baroque main staircase of the central (originally northern) wing and gave access to the private apartments of Maria Theresa. In the 18th century there was an officer's dining room and a smaller kitchen on the ground floor and another dining room with a cafe kitchen on the first floor. The southern and northern (later central) wings had the same ground plan: all the rooms opened from a passageway running along the sides of a rectangular central court. The two monumental stairways were rebuilt by Hauszmann in Neo-Baroque style. = St Stephen's Chapel = left St Stephen's Chapel, known before as St. Sigismund Chapel, or Castle Church (Szent Zsigmond-k√°polna, V√°rtemplom) was the chapel royal in the western end of this wing, which had no fa√ßades, only a door opening onto Lions Court (through an antechamber). Construction was finished in 1768 and the church was consecrated in 1769. The ground plan was drawn by Nicolaus Pacassi, with the interior was designed by his follower, Franz Anton Hillebrandt. The ground plan followed a typical \\"violin\\" form favoured in the Baroque church architecture of Central Europe at that time. It had a rectangular chancel and a nave with four bays for side altars. On the first and the second floors two oratories opened into the chancel and a two-storey high gallery was situated above the entrance. In 1777‚Äì78 a new door was opened in the first side bay to give access to the new chapel of the Holy Right. An engraving from 1771 to 1780 shows the original interior design in its completed form: double pilasters, windows with segmental arches, stucco and false marble decoration, double oratory windows and a doorway with a stucco veil drawn aside by flying putti. The church was slightly rebuilt by Hauszmann, who demolished the Chapel of the Holy Right in 1899 and built a new chapel for the relic behind the chancel (converting a small recess). This chapel was decorated with the golden Venetian mosaics of K√°roly Lotz. A new Neo-Baroque main altar was built in the church in 1899. 20th-century photos testify that the church survived in its Baroque form until the war. During a siege, the vaults of the church partially collapsed and the furniture was plundered. The Castle Church was left decaying for more than a decade. In 1957 the remaining two vaults collapsed, and the church was totally destroyed and converted to exhibition spaces. The altar table was rescued and re-erected in Pilisv√∂r√∂sv√°r in 1957. The Lotz mosaics from the Chapel of the Holy Right were also rescued and re-assembled in Balatonalm√°di. = Palatinal Crypt = Tomb of Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary in the Palatinal Crypt The Palatinal Crypt (N√°dori kripta) was under the former palace chapel and is the only surviving room of the whole Royal Castle. The underground crypt was first used as a burial place between 1770 and 1777. In August 1820, Elisabeth Karoline, Palatine Joseph's infant daughter was buried in the crypt. Seventeen years later, the Palatine's 13-year-old son Alexander Leopold followed. Palatine Joseph decided to convert the crypt into a family mausoleum and commissioned Franz H√ºppmann with the task. The work was finished in 1838, and other members of the Palatine's family were reburied here. Palatine Joseph himself was interred on 13 January 1847. The crypt was continuously used by the Hungarian branch of the Habsburg family. It was repeatedly restored and enriched with new works of art, frescoes, statues and ornate stone sarcophagi, made by renowned artists of the 19th century. The last member of the family buried there was Archduchess Klotild in 1927. The crypt survived the war unscathed and was spared during the post-war reconstruction. The crypt was looted in 1966 and 1973 (during the construction works), when some corpses were thrown out of the sarcophagi by the thieves. The human remains were later identified and reburied. The crypt was restored in 1985‚Äì1987. Since then the Palatinal Crypt is part of the exhibition of the Hungarian National Gallery. North Wing = Lobby = The main lobby (El≈ëcsarnok) of the Royal Palace was situated in Hauszmann's Northern Wing On the Danube side. It was a long, rectangular hall divided into four sections with free standing Ionic columns and two square pillars. The section at the southern end was elevated a few steps. Nine arched windows opened towards the Danube. In the middle of the other sidewall, a doorway led to the inner courtyard. The walls and the ceiling were stuccoed. The southern elevation was closed off with a stone balustrade between the pillars and the wall. The ornate lobby was designed for important state ceremonies. = Grand Ballroom = The Grand Ballroom The Grand Ballroom (Nagy b√°lterem), in the middle part of the northern wing, took over the function of the smaller old ballroom in the Baroque wing. Designed by Hauszmann, it was the most splendid room of the palace. The two-storey high, airy room was lavishly decorated with stuccoes, half columns, trabeation, balconies and six crystal chandeliers in Neo-Baroque style. Seven arched windows and doorways opened towards a pillared terrace facing the western forecourt. On the other side, the ballroom was connected to the Buffet Hall through three doors. Photos made after the war show the room with its vaulted ceiling collapsed. The ballroom was not restored but totally destroyed in the course of the post-war remodelling. = Dining Hall = The Dining Hall The Dining Hall (Buffet-csarnok), on the Danube side of the northern wing, was a very long hall used for state banquets. It was connected to the Great Ballroom nearby and it was possible to join them together. There was a shorter, passage-like space between the two rooms. This passage was separated from the Buffet Hall by six square pillars, while its other side was a solid wall with three doors. On the eastern side of the Buffet Hall a long row of windows opened towards the Danube and a pillared terrace. The Buffet Hall was divided into three sections with free-standing Ionic columns, holding trabeations. The vaulted ceiling was lavishly decorated with frescoes and stuccoes. = Habsburg Hall = The Habsburg Hall The Habsburg Hall (Habsburg terem) was situated in the middle of the long palace complex, under Hauszmann's (false) dome, where the new northern wing and the old palace met. Although this part of the building belonged to the original palace, it was thoroughly rebuilt by Hauszmann‚Äìthis stately room was totally his own work. It was one of the three historical rooms of the palace representing the important periods of Hungarian history. A free-standing, double flight of steps, called the Habsburg Steps, connected the room with the Royal Gardens on the Danube terrace. The room had lavish Baroque decorations with half-pillars and gilded stuccoes. The vaulted ceiling was decorated with K√°roly Lotz's fresco Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty. K√°roly Senyei's four Carrara marble busts stood in front of the sidewalls representing King Charles III, Queen Maria Theresa, King Franz Joseph and Queen Elisabeth. The Habsburg Hall survived World War II relatively undamaged, but in the 1950s it was demolished for political reasons. Krisztinav√°ros wing Wing facing the district of Krisztinav√°ros The Krisztinav√°ros wing faces the district of Krisztinav√°ros, which was named in honour of the daughter of Queen Maria Theresa, Archduchess Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen. = Entrance hall = The entrance hall (El≈ëcsarnok) opened from Lions Court, under an arcaded Neo-Renaissance portico, through ornate wrought-iron doors. This now serves as the entrance of the Hungarian National Library. The hall was a long, oblong-shaped room with 4+4 free standing Ionic columns in front of the walls on the longer sides, holding a trabeation. In the end of the shorter sides two doors opened into antechambers. The three arcaded doorways on the longer side opened into a lobby. The ceiling of the hallway was stuccoed, and the whole design was Italian Renaissance in style. = Lobby = The Grand Staircase The lobby (El≈ëcsarnok) was connected to the hall of the main staircase through pillars. The stuccoed ceiling was held up by two rectangular pillars. The apartments of Archduke J√≥zsef √Ågost and his wife, Archduchess Auguszta, were situated on the ground floor of the Krisztinav√°ros wing and opened from this room. Now it serves as the lobby of the Hungarian National Library in a radically modernised form. = Main Staircase = The monumental main staircase (F≈ël√©pcs≈ëh√°z), with three flights, led up from the lobby to the first floor in an airy, glass-roofed hall. The side walls of the hall were decorated in Italian Renaissance style with colossal Corinthian half-columns, stuccoes and lunette openings. Ornate wrought-iron chandeliers and intricate balustrades decorated the stairs. On the ground floor, colossal Atlas statues stood beside the side pillars, holding the weight of the upper flights. The marble statues were the works of J√°nos Fadrusz from 1897. During the post-war reconstruction the main staircase was radically modernised. Only the two colossal Atlas statues survived. Now they are standing somewhat incongruently near their original places. = St Stephen's Room = St Stephen's Room St Stephen's Room (\\"Szent Istv√°n\\" terem), on the first floor of the Krisztinav√°ros wing, was one of the \\"historical rooms\\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. Together with the Matthias Room and the Habsburg Room, they represented the three most important periods of Hungarian history. Saint Stephen's Room connected the new Private Royal Apartments and‚Äîthrough a very long passageway‚Äîthe Old Royal Apartments in the Danube Wing. Its style evoked the age of the √Årp√°ds, the first Hungarian dynasty in the early Middle Ages. The walls were clad with dark carved wood paneling. The most spectacular item was a large stone mantelpiece with Romanesque Revival architectural details and the bust of King Saint Stephen, the first king of Hungary. The room was furnished with medieval-looking metal chandeliers and heavy wooden furniture. = Matthias Room = Matthias Room Matthias Room (M√°ty√°s terem) was named after King Matthias Corvinus, who ruled in the late Middle Ages. It was one of the three \\"historical rooms\\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. The room opened from the Royal Bedroom, at the end of the line of private apartments. It had three windows opening towards the hills of Buda. There was a long terrace in front of the room. The style of the Matthias Room was Renaissance, with carved wooden paneling and a coffered ceiling. It was furnished with a mantelpiece in the corner and two chandeliers, the most spectacular item being the equestrian statue of King Matthias, sculpted by J√°nos Fadrusz. The statue was a miniature copy of the original standing on the main square of Kolozsv√°r (now Cluj-Napoca). This copy was saved after the war and put on display in the Hungarian National Gallery. = Strong Room = Hungarian Crown Jewels on display at the Strong Room The Hungarian crown jewels were kept in the specially-designed Strong Room (P√°nc√©lterem) on the second floor of the Krisztinav√°ros Wing. The Crown of Saint Stephen was kept here between 1900 and 1944. = Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum = The small Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum (Erzs√©bet Kir√°lyn√© Eml√©km√∫zeum) on the second floor of the Krisztinav√°ros Wing was established in remembrance of Queen Elisabeth after her murder in 1898. Memorabilia were collected by Ida Ferenczy, Elisabeth's former lady-in-waiting, Viscountess Pallavicini and Countess Ilona Batthy√°ny. The museum opened on 15 January 1908 as an affiliate of the Hungarian National Museum. The collection contained personal items, letters and clothes. Its most important relic was the costume that Elisabeth had been wearing when she was murdered. One room was meticulously recreated as the Queen's own writing room with her original writing desk and her 219 Hungarian books. The museum was badly damaged during World War II,\\"Budapest including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle\\", UNESCO.hu, 2010. and the surviving relics were bestowed to other museums. Private royal apartments = Royal Entrance Hall = The Entrance Hall The Royal Entrance Hall (Fejedelmi el≈ëterem), on the first floor of the Krisztinav√°ros Wing, gave access to the rooms of the Private Royal Apartments of King Franz Joseph I. The private apartments were situated in the southwestern part of the Krisztinav√°ros wing, their windows opening towards the hills of Buda. The Royal Entrance Hall was connected through a wide passageway to the main staircase hall. The spacious, oblong- shaped hall was divided in three, with two pairs of Ionic marble columns supporting architraves. The central part of the room was much longer than the bays at the ends. Doors connected the hall with the rooms of the private apartments. In the middle of the longer wall stood an ornate stone mantelpiece with the bust of Franz Joseph. On the other side, three windows opened to the inner courtyard of the Krisztinav√°ros wing. The ceiling was stuccoed and the side walls of the hall were covered with marble. = Antechamber = Antechamber The antechamber (El≈ëterem) of the private apartments opened from the Royal Entrance Hall. It had three windows facing toward the hills. The room had a typical Biedermeier white-golden stucco decoration with floral wallpapers, resembling to the cosy rooms of Sch√∂nbrunn Palace. All the rooms of the private apartments followed this Viennese style favoured by the King. The antechamber was furnished with a stone mantelpiece (with a mirror above), an Empire crystal chandelier, a stone flowerpot standing on a fluted column and Neo-Renaissance table with chairs. = Audience Room = The Audience Room The audience room (Fogad√≥szoba) of Franz Joseph I was situated in a corner of the private apartments wing, with two windows opening southwards and three windows opening westwards. It had a beautiful stuccoed and frescoed ceiling. The walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, a golden Rococo console table with a large mirror and a parlour suite. = Writing Room = Writing room in the royal suite The writing room (√çr√≥szoba) of Franz Joseph had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white cocklestove, a table and chairs. To the right and left two similar parlours opened from the room. = Royal Bedroom = Bedroom of the king The bedroom (Fejedelmi h√°l√≥szoba) of the king had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, the baldachined royal bed and a folding screen. The bedroom was connected to a dressing room, a private bathroom and smaller rooms belonging to the butler and the servants. = Royal Dining Hall = The Dining Room The Royal Dining Hall (Fejedelmi eb√©dl≈ë) opened from the Royal Entrance Hall, and it was the largest room of the private apartments. The long hall had six windows opening towards Gell√©rt Hill. Three crystal chandeliers gave light to the elegant stuccoed space. In the middle of the longer side wall, between the two doors, stood a marble mantelpiece. = \\"Circle\\" Room = The \\"Circle\\" Room The \\"Circle\\" Room (\\"Circle\\" terem) opened from the Royal Dining Hall. It was the last room of the private apartments on the southern side, with three windows opening towards Gell√©rt Hill. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white cocklestove and chairs. = Dining Room = The Dining Room in the royal guest suite The small dining room (Eb√©dl≈ë) was situated in the northern part of the Krisztinav√°ros wing, among the other rooms of the Royal Guest Suite. Four windows opened towards Krisztinav√°ros. The ceiling was stuccoed, while the walls were covered with carved wooden panelling and wallpaper. A stone mantelpiece and large painting above it (depicting a hunting scene with a deer) gave a homey feeling to the room. It was furnished with a crystal chandelier and a long dining table with 12 chairs.  Archducal Apartments  These apartments, on the ground floor of the Krisztinav√°ros Wing, were designed in 1902 for Archduke Joseph August of Austria (1872‚Äì1962), the head of the Hungarian branch of the Habsburgs and his wife, Archduchess Augusta (1875‚Äì1964). They could be reached from the lobby of the Krisztinav√°ros wing through a long passageway. The most important rooms were (in due course): the salon, where guests were entertained; the great parlour; parlour; dining room; the Archduke's study; the Archduke's bedroom; the Archduchess' bedroom; the Archduchess' study; and the breakfast parlour. All rooms had a relatively simple decoration with white stuccoed ceilings and stucco panels above the doorways. The walls were covered with wallpaper. Crystal chandeliers, stone mantelpieces and typical turn-of-the-century furniture gave the rooms a homey ambiance. The great parlour was decorated with large paintings. Works of art The castle and its gardens have been decorated with works of art since their foundation in the 14th century. Only written sources speak about the most important medieval works, but detailed pictorial and written information exists about the 19th-century artistic decoration of the palace, which was mainly created by the most important Hungarian artists of the era. Many of the statues survived the destruction during the siege of Budapest in 1944‚Äì45 and were later restored. On the other hand, important works of art were destroyed during the controversial reconstruction of the castle during the 1950s and 1960s. =Sculptural monuments= 255x255px ;Matthias Fountain (M√°ty√°s k√∫tja) The spectacular fountain decorates the western forecourt of the palace. It shows a group of hunters led by King Matthias Corvinus together with hounds, a killed deer, Galeotto Marzio with a hawk and Sz√©p Ilonka with a doe. This group of people stands between fallen rocks with water running down into a basin. The fountain was made by sculptor Alajos Str√≥bl. The dead deer was modelled upon a majestic stag killed in 1896 by poachers in the forest owned by Str√≥bl. The damaged sculpture was restored after the war. Nowadays it is probably the most photographed object in the palace. ;Monument of Prince Eugene of Savoy The equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy stands on the Danube terrace, in a prominent position, high above Budapest. The Neo-Baroque statue was made by sculptor J√≥zsef R√≥na for the town of Zenta, but the town could not afford the price. The monument was bought in 1900 as a temporary solution until the planned equestrian statue of King Franz Joseph was completed. This never happened, so Prince Eugen remained on his plinth. The plinth is decorated with two bronze reliefs showing the capture of the earth- works in Zenta and the decisive cavalry charge in the Battle of Zenta in 1697. Monument of Prince Eugene of SavoyThe mythological Turul bird240x240px ;Horseherd (Csik√≥s) The statue of the Hortob√°gy National Park horseherd taming a wild horse originally stood in front of the Riding School in the former √öjvil√°g terrace. It is the work of Gy√∂rgy Vastagh from 1901. The statue was displayed in the Exposition Universelle in Paris (1900). The damaged statue was removed during the 1960s, but it was later restored and erected in the western forecourt of the palace in 1983, next to the Matthias Fountain. ;Turulbird (Turulmad√°r) The mythological Turul, high above the Danube, was made by Gyula Don√°th in 1905. The plinth and the ornate Neo-Baroque rail (Gyula Jungfer's work) was seriously damaged during the siege of Buda, but they were restored in 1981, together with the broken coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary on the plinth. Fishing Children by K√°roly Senyei ;Fishing Children The Fountain of the Fishing Children on the Danube terrace is the work of sculptor K√°roly Senyei from 1912. It depicts two children grappling with a fish. The fine workmanship of the fishing net is remarkable. The fountain was removed in 1955 and re-erected at R√°k√≥czi Square in Pest, but brought back to its original place in 1976. It was restored in 2001. ;Csongor and T√ºnde The two statues depicting Csongor and T√ºnde, literary figures from Mih√°ly V√∂r√∂smarty's drama, originally decorated the Habsburg Steps in front of the palace. They are the works of sculptor Mikl√≥s Ligeti from 1903. The steps were demolished after the war, but the statues were saved and re-erected in 1976 on top of two simple concrete plinths near their original locations. ;Lions Two pairs of lions guard the monumental gate leading into Lions Court. The four statues are the works of J√°nos Fadrusz from 1901. The animals standing on the outer side of the gate are calm and dignified, while the inner ones are menacing. One lion was broken in two pieces during the war, but it was recreated in the 1950s. ;War and Peace One of the lions in the inner courtyard The monumental allegorical bronze statues of War and Peace stand beside the entrance to the Budapest History Museum. They are the work of K√°roly Senyei. Both War and Peace are represented by angels, one with a trumpet, the other with an olive branch. Under the angel of Peace is a returning soldier, while under the angel of War there is a dead Ottoman soldier and ancient Hungarian warriors. There are sepulchral monuments in the Palatinal Crypt decorated with the statues of Gy√∂rgy Zala, Alajos Str√≥bl and K√°roly Senyei.  Lost works of art  ;Hungaria The monumental sculpture group decorated the main (northern) fa√ßade of the palace, facing Szent Gy√∂rgy Square. On the top of the attic, crowning the fa√ßade, stood the female figure of Hungaria, the allegorical representation of Hungary. Two semi-nude figures sat at her side, one male and one female, representing Industry and Commerce. The group was made by sculptor Gyula Jankovits in 1905. The sculpture was destroyed, together with the whole northern fa√ßade, during the 1950s. ;Pediment Group The pediment above the Habsburg Steps was decorated with an allegorical group of K√°roly Senyei representing the Apotheosis of the Dual Monarchy. It was destroyed during the 1950s, together with the great coat-of- arms of the Kingdom of Hungary which originally crowned the fa√ßade. The present-day pediment is plain, without any sculptural decoration. ;Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty The ceiling of the Habsburg Room was decorated with a fresco representing the apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty. It was the last important work of K√°roly Lotz, painted in 1903, one year before his death. The artist was already seriously ill when he worked on the fresco. The \\"Apotheosis\\" followed the traditions of Baroque court painting, and the work was praised by contemporary critics. The fresco survived the war unscathed, but it was destroyed in the 1950s. Museums and institutions The ground plan of the castle complex, with the location of the museums Baroque Oroszl√°nos Gate of the Hungarian National Gallery The Budapest History Museum is located in the southern wing of Buda Castle, in Building E, over four floors. It presents the history of Budapest from its beginnings until the modern era. The restored part of the medieval castle, including the Royal Chapel and the rib-vaulted Gothic Hall, belongs to the exhibition. The highlights of the exhibition are the Gothic statues of Buda Castle and a 14th- century silk tapestry decorated with the Angevin coats of arms. Small gardens were recreated in the medieval zwingers around the oldest parts of the building. The Hungarian National Gallery is located in Building A, B, C and D. The museum presents the history of Hungarian art from the 11th century until the present, with a special exhibition concentrating on Gothic altarpieces (housed in the former Baroque Ballroom). The only surviving interior from the pre-war Royal Palace, the Palatinal Crypt, belongs to the museum. \\"Building F\\" is occupied by the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library, the national library of Hungary. Its collection of rare and antique books, codices and manuscripts contains 35 Corvina pieces from the famous library of King Matthias Corvinus. The original Bibliotheca Corviniana was housed in the medieval Royal Castle of Buda.  The cellars and caves  During the Ottoman era, the extensive cave system was utilized by the hunters to store tigers and Hungarian mountain bears. The cellars stored an ornate wine collection from the Ergi wine growing region in the Northern frontier of Hungary.

Apple Panic is an unauthorized version of the 1980 arcade game Space Panic, the first game with ladders and platforms. While the arcade original remained obscure, Apple Panic became a top seller for home computers. It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family, VIC-20, IBM PC (as a self- booting disk), and TRS-80. Gameplay Screenshot showing the three enemies. The player controls a character that walks left and right along platforms made of green brick and climbs up and down ladders between them. The player can use a shovel to dig holes through the platforms, into which enemies will fall and become trapped. Once an enemy is stuck in a hole, the player must strike it repeatedly with the shovel until it falls through and hits the level below. This must be done quickly, because after about 17 seconds an enemy will be able to free itself, filling in the hole in the process. The player can also refill holes they've dug, or drop through them. There are three types of enemy in the game, the first and most numerous being the \\"apples\\". An apple will die if it falls at a single level. As the player advances, green and blue enemies will start to appear, which must be dropped through at least two or three levels, respectively. This is accomplished by digging a series of holes, one directly below another, and trapping the enemy in the uppermost hole. The player earns extra points if they drop one monster on top of another (killing them both). On each level, the player has only a limited time to dispatch all the enemies, tracked by a bar at the bottom of the screen. There are four distinct configurations of platforms and ladders through which the game cycles, but in every one there will always be five platforms in which the player can dig. Ports The Atari 8-bit family and IBM PC ports were done by Olaf Lubeck, who also wrote Cannonball Blitz for the Apple II. The TRS-80 version was programmed by Yves Lempereur and published by Funsoft. Reception Unlike Space Panic, Apple Panic was very successful. Debuting in July 1981, the game sold 15,000 copies by June 1982, appearing on Computer Gaming Worlds list of top sellers. Softline reported in 1983 that it was among the top 30 best-selling Apple software for almost two years, in contrast to the \\"two to four month life span\\" of the typical arcade game. Electronic Games described Apple Panic in 1983 as \\"delicious true to\\" the gameplay of Space Panic. Byte in 1982 called Apple Panic \\"one of the most creative and novel games to be invented for a microcomputer\\". PC Magazine in 1983 stated \\"Yes, Apple Panic is a pretty dumb game. It's also fun to play and pretty to watch ... a welcome change from the endless stream of shoot-em-ups in space\\". Owen Linzmayer reviewing the TRS-80 version for Creative Computing wrote, \\"The Apple Panic packaging promises voice and sound effects. This is a bit misleading. The only time the computer speaks (through the AUX port), is when it displays the banner page. At this time, it says only two words, 'Apple Panic'.\\" He concluded, \\"Apple Panic from Funsoft may be well on its way to the top of the charts.\\" References External links * Apple Panic at Atari Mania * Clone written in the Seed7 programming language.

They are similar in format to other physical activity based fundraising events such as marathons and cycling races, but are usually non-competitive and lower intensity. The low intensity model is ideal for mobilizing broad-based community support, and as a result Walkathons usually target participants from a wide range of ages and economic backgrounds. Walkathons are popular fundraisers for issues that affect large sections of the population. Most commonly, Walkathons focus on fighting or curing pervasive diseases or ailments such as AIDS, Cancer, Diabetes, Lupus, and Arthritis, and participation is also often promoted as a symbol of empowerment, remembrance, or awareness of sufferers and their relations. Walkathons are also popular for elementary schools because they allow the children to make a visible contribution to their school, they build community, are fun, encourage healthy exercise, and can be very lucrative. History The first known walkathon was held in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1953, by the Puerto Rican actor/comedian, Ram√≥n Rivero,Walkathon Guide, a blog about organizing walkathonsPuerto Rican Senate Resolution declaring May 29 of each year as the \\"Day of Ram√≥n Ortiz del Rivero (Diplo)\\" better known as Diplo. He walked 80 miles (from the capital city of San Juan to Ponce, on the other side of the island, to raise money for the Liga Puertorrique√±a Contra el C√°ncer (the Puerto Rican League Against Cancer). In that walkathon, Ram√≥n Rivero raised the equivalent of $85,000 in four days. The walkathon turned into an historical event that became part of the collective consciousness of Puerto Ricans all over the world and has been copied several times since, including in 2009, when the \\"League\\", in memory of the first event, did a \\"Diplo Returns to San Juan\\" walkathon, raising almost $200,000. In 1968, the first walkathon was held on the US mainland, sponsored by the American Freedom from Hunger Foundation. After receiving a national promo from Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon, who were in the Twin Cities for a live performance of The Tonight Show, the Minneapolis, Minnesota walkathon, called the \\"International Walk for Development\\", drew over 3,000 walkers to the 33-mile route through the streets of Minneapolis. The local organizers included two high school activists, Laurel Norton of St. Paul, and Howard Freedland of Minneapolis, who convinced Johnny Carson to promote the event and organized local churches and synagogues to support the walk. Additional walks were held in Fargo, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota, where 650 walkers finished the entire 33-mile route. The other walkathon organizers included Harvey Silver and a former priest named Jack Healey. On a stopover in England, when returning from the Peace Corps, they saw adults participating in sponsored walks to raise money for causes. Together with Bob Schumacher, who provided the public relations support, the first walkathons were held in the US, primarily with children walking, rather than adults. On 8 May 1971, the largest nationally coordinated walkathon to date saw over 150,000 American walkers on several dozen routes throughout the nation walk over 2 million miles, raising over $1.2m to fight hunger. These \\"Walks for Development\\" were coordinated by the American Freedom from Hunger Foundation. The largest 8 May walk was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with an estimated 20,000 walkers on a 31-mile route. Other large marches that day were in Indianapolis, Eugene, and Philadelphia. The concept immediately caught on with other groups, and many organizations soon adopted walkathons for fundraising. To date, the record for the world's largest recorded walkathon has been grabbed by the Iglesia Ni Cristo, a religious organization based in the Philippines. This largest walk for a cause, which happened on 15 February 2014, was dubbed the Iglesia Ni Cristo World Wide Walk For Those Affected by Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan. It breaks two Guinness world records as the largest charity walk in a single venue (Manila, Philippines) with 175,000 participants, and the largest charity walk in 24 hours for multiple venues (from Christchurch, New Zealand to Hawaii, USA) with 519,521 participants.

The term \\"barra\\" is Glaswegian dialect for \\"barrow\\", relating to the market's early years, where traders sold their wares from handcarts. Barrowland is sometimes used to describe the district itself where the market is located, which is actually officially known as Calton.  History  One of Glasgow's most famous institutions, The Barras was founded by James and Margaret McIver in the interwar years. Several of the smaller 1921-era market halls still bear the McIver name, although the main Barrowland Ballroom building was rebuilt after a fire in 1958, reopening in 1960. The ballroom has become a world-famous musical venue. There was a 'barra's queen.' The original building opened in 1934 in a mercantile area east of Glasgow's city centre. The Barrowland building includes large street-level halls used for the weekend markets, with a sizeable weatherproof dance hall above. The front of the building is decorated with a distinctive animated neon sign. In 2016, with market stalls quieter than in previous decades, the city council looked at proposals to redevelop the area.  Location  Because of its location on Gallowgate - the main thoroughfare from the city centre to Parkhead and Celtic Park, Barrowlands is also notable for its large concentration of public houses and shops devoted to fans of Celtic Football Club. Baird's Bar was one of the best known Celtic-oriented pubs next door to the Barrowland Ballroom building, the bar has since closed down due to violent incidents that have occurred in the premises. The bar is to be reopened as a furniture store. Glasgow Antiques and Randalls Antique and vintage Center, the Cartwheel and the Square Yard can all be found next to the Squirrel Bar. Local Features There is a large number of indoor covered markets, and many stalls in the street markets as well. Wares range from, for example fresh fruit and veg, boots and kilts to antiques and collectables. Also nearby is Saint Alphonsus RC Church - also known as the Church at the Barras.

Famous for his work with aeroplanes as theme; none of which are able nor constructed to actually leave the ground. Life and Work Panamarenko was born in Antwerp, where he studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts from 1955 to 1960. Before 1968, his art was inspired by pop-art, but early on he became interested in aeroplanes and human powered flight. This interest is also reflected in his name, which supposedly is an acronym for \\"Pan American Airlines and Company\\". The name Panamarenko may also be influenced by Panteleimon Ponomarenko, a politician-ambassador from the former Soviet Union. Starting in 1970, he developed his first models of imaginary vehicles, aeroplanes, balloons or helicopters, in original and surprising appearances. Many of his sculptures are modern variants of the myth of Icarus. The question of whether his creations can actually fly is part of their mystery and appeal. His airship The Aeromodeller (1980) is a major exhibit at MSK Ghent. The artists he admired include, amongst others: Joseph Beuys, Marcel Broodthaers, Bruce Nauman and Pablo Picasso. In 2003, Panamarenko married Eveline Hoorens. At the opening of a large-scale overview exhibition of his work in Brussels in 2005, Panamarenko announced his retirement as an artist. Following his stated retirement from creating visual art he promoted his own coffee brand PanamaJumbo. On 24 April 2009, VLM Airlines based in Antwerp, Belgium named one of its Fokker 50 aircraft in his honour. Panamarenko received two honorary doctorates: In 2010 at the University of Hasselt and in 2014 at the University of Mons. While retired, Panamarenko created the Waving Crabs, a series of fountains sprayed by crab figures on three stainless-steel half bowl shaped islands situated in the Zegemeer, a large pond at Knokke-Heist. He inaugurated it on 7 October 2011 stating the idea dated from 1975. In July 2020 a graffiti artwork was made dedicated to him, opposite his former atelier.

Ireland In 1781, George Hamilton was born at Hamwood House, in County Meath, Ireland. He was the third son of Charles Hamilton (d. 1818), who built Hamwood, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Crewe Chetwood of Woodbrook, Queen's County. His family were descended from James Hamilton of Finnart and had come to Ireland during the reign of James VI and I in the Plantations of Ireland. He was a nephew of Hugh Hamilton, Bishop of Ossory, and his first cousin, George Hamilton of Hampton Hall, Co. Dublin (a priest), was the father of George Alexander Hamilton. Quebec Hamilton came to Quebec City sometime before 1807. He and his brother William were merchants importing Madeira wine and selling other goods. In 1809, they set themselves up in the timber trade in Lower Canada, exporting lumber and supplying shipbuilders. As a result of a timber operator being unable to honour his contract, they became owners of a mill at Hawkesbury, Ontario associated with lumbering along the Rideau River. During the War of 1812, George served in the Quebec militia reaching the rank of major. When his brother retired, he moved to Hawkesbury to look after the mill. In 1816, Hamilton became a Justice of the Peace and judge in the new Ottawa District Court of Upper Canada. During the 1820s, a downturn in the timber trade resulted in hard times for the Hamilton family and the business teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. In 1830, Hamilton formed a partnership with Charles Adamson Low. The mill at Hawkesbury grew to become one of the top producers in the country. Although Hamilton had resorted to illegal cutting on crown lands when establishing his business, he now began to lobby the government to introduce a system of licenses to control timber cutting on crown land. A fee- based system was introduced and, at Bytown, a down payment was collected against future cutting fees which favoured the wealthier operators and discouraged speculation. In the valley of the Gatineau River, Hamilton helped establish the so-called Gatineau Privilege, established by an order-in-council in November 1832 which limited the number of operators in the region. Despite protests, it remained in effect until 1843. Hamilton and Low had a similar arrangement in the valley of the Rouge River. Family At Quebec, Hamilton married Susannah Christina \\"Lucy\\" Craigie, daughter of John Craigie and Susannah Coffin, daughter of John Coffin (1729-1808) of Quebec and a first cousin of admiral Isaac Coffin. Lucy Hamilton was a niece of Margaret Coffin Sheaffe (wife of Roger Hale Sheaffe) and a half-sister of the wife of Benjamin Joseph Frobisher. In 1822 or 1823, while Hamilton and his family were descending the Ottawa River to Montreal, their canoe overturned in rapids and their three young children drowned. Hamilton died of a severe cold at Hawkesbury after a trip to review militia in the 1837‚Äì38 rebellions. He was survived by at least six children, *Robert Hamilton (1822-1898), continued the family's timber trade. He married Isabella, daughter of John Thomson of Quebec; parents of John Hamilton. *George Hamilton (1824-1856), married Julia, daughter of Judge George Stephen Benjamin Jarvis. They were the parents of George Wellesley Hamilton. *John Hamilton, senator, President of Sir Hugh Allan's Merchants Bank of Canada, Montreal. *Henrietta Hamilton (1830-1857), married Andrew Thomson (1829-1907), President of the Union Bank of Canada and the Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Company.

It is a localization of the fourth Kunio-kun game released for the Family Computer. Ports for the PC Engine and Mega Drive were also released in Japan. A Game Boy version was released in Japan, North America, and Europe. Plot =Nekketsu High School Dodgeball Club: Soccer= Eight students known as Atsushi, Genei, Hiroyuki, Kunio, Masa, Masahiro, Susumu and Takashi compete in a soccer tournament against 13 other high schools. =Nintendo World Cup= Thirteen national teams compete in a world cup to become number 1. (At the time of the game's release, the German team represented West Germany, with the East German team reunifying with West Germany later on in 1990.)   (West Germany)   * Gameplay Gameplay of Nintendo World Cup. The player-controlled U.S.A. team competes against Japan, led by Kunio. At its core, the game follows the rules of football, but with noticeable differences. Each team has only six players (a goalkeeper, two defenders, a midfielder and two forwards). You control only one of them, but you can give commands (Pass/Shoot) to the others. Offsides are non-existent and fouls are not punished. Players can be knocked out by repeatedly sliding, tackling or shooting them, afterwards they will stay down for the rest of the half. Players can also use up to five \\"super shots\\" per half; these powerful, odd-looking shots are used whenever a player does a bicycle kick or a diving header,Instruction booklet, p. 6 or when he shoots after walking a certain number of steps.Instruction booklet, p. 14 The \\"super shots\\" differ from team to team. The playing fields also differ in respect to material, e.g. ice, which heavily impacts movement of players and the ball. There are two game modes:Instruction booklet, pp. 7‚Äì8 *Tournament mode, in which one or two players take control of one of the 13 available teams, in order to defeat their CPU-controlled opponents. *VS Match mode, which enables players to confront each other on sand, ice or dirt playing fields.Instruction booklet, p.17 On the NES version, up to four players can compete using the NES Four ScoreInstruction booklet, p.17 or the NES Satellite. For the Game Boy a link cable or Four Player Adapter would be used. Graphically, the NES version game looks similar to the Famicom version and other games in the Kunio-kun series, particularly Downtown Nekketsu Story/River City Ransom, with its short-legged, big-headed characters with varied faces; in fact, some sprites, such as Kunio and the other members of the Japanese team, were reused from that game. Regional differences The NES version of Nekketsu High School Dodge Ball Club: Soccer Edition, Nintendo World Cup, differs from its counterpart, in which instead of a soccer tournament set in Japan between thirteen high schools, the game centers around a World Cup. In the main Tournament Mode, the player takes control of the main team of Nekketsu High School team and competes against the twelve other teams. The Tournament Mode's opening intro and story sequences are removed in the NES version. In the Famicom version's \\"Vs. Match Mode\\", the player can only choose between the Nekketsu team and four other teams. Since the main Tournament Mode in the Famicom version only featured a single team, the NES localization allows the player to choose between the thirteen nationalities represented in the game by changing the palette of the player's team and their super shots. However, unlike the Famicom version, the NES version supports up to four players instead of two. Ports =Game Boy= A port to the Game Boy was released as in Japan and was based on Nintendo World Cup. It was released in North America and Europe under the same name. Players =PC Engine CD= The game was ported to PC Engine's Super CD-ROM¬≤ and retitled and was released in December 20, 1991, was published by Naxat Soft. This version includes five national teams (France, Brazil, Argentina, Italy and Germany) in Tournament mode which is after beating the final match. =PC Engine= A similar version for the PC Engine HuCard was released on April 13, 1992 under the title Only differences between the two versions, the CD version has an arranged soundtrack and add voice acting for opening intro and cut scene, while the HuCard version has no voice acting, etc. =Mega Drive= A Mega Drive version of the game, titled was released by Palsoft in Japan on August 7, 1992. Unlike the Famicom/NES version and other platforms, this version has all the teams playable in VS. Mode. =Game Boy Advance= The Famicom version of the game was ported to Game Boy Advance as the part of Kunio-kun Nekketsu Collection 2 (along with Downtown Nekketsu K≈çshinkyoku: Soreyuke Daiund≈çkai), was released on October 27, 2005 in Japan. =Virtual Console= The original Famicom version of Nekketsu High School Dodgeball Club: Soccer Edition was re- released for Virtual Console in Japan on October 7, 2008 for the Wii and on March 19, 2014 for the Wii U. As for Nintendo World Cup, however, there are no plans for the game to be released in North America or PAL regions. The PC Engine Super CD-ROM¬≤ version of the game was also re-released in Japan for the Wii on November 4, 2008.

Shortly after its founding it had 1,420, and in 1926 approximately 60,000 members. History It was founded in Berlin by Jewish intellectuals on 26 March 1893. The CV‚Äôs aim was to unify German citizens of Jewish faith, to fight for the Jews‚Äô rights as citizens and to combat rising antisemitism. Commitment to the German Nation was an important part of the CV‚Äôs agenda - the members saw themselves primarily as German citizens with their own religion. Consequently, the CV repudiated Zionism. Beginning in 1922, the CV published a weekly newspaper, called C.V.-Zeitung (C.V.-Newspaper) and continued fighting the rising antisemitic threat. Through publications and conversations with the President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg and economic leaders, the CV tried to call attention to the threat. In 1926, there were approximately 60,000 members.

The name, Mutnedjmet, translates as: The sweet Mut.

Tyldesley, Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt, 2006, Thames & Hudson This identification was partially based on the fact that Mutbenret's name used to be read as Mutnedjmet. Other Egyptologist such as Geoffrey Martin note that there is no definite evidence to prove this assertion.Geoffrey Martin, The Hidden Tombs of Memphis, Thames & Hudson (1991), p.96 Martin writes that: : The name Mutnodjmet was not particularly rare in the late Eighteenth Dynasty, and even if she were the sister of Nefertiti her marriage to Horemheb would have had no effect on Horemheb's legitimacy or candidacy since Mutnodjmet (who is depicted in the private tombs at El-Amarna) was not herself of royal blood. In any case whatever her antecedents Mutnodjmet could have been married to Horemheb a little before he became Pharaoh. Monuments and inscriptions Mutnedjmet is known from several objects and inscriptions: * A double statue of Horemheb and Mutnedjmet was found in Karnak, but is now in the Museo Egizio in Turin (1379). On Mutnedjmet's side of the throne she is depicted as a winged sphinx who adores her own cartouche. As a sphinx she is depicted wearing a flat topped crown topped with plant elements associated with the goddess Tefnut. The back of the statue records Horemheb's rise to power. * Horemheb and Mutnodjemet are depicted in the tomb of Roy (TT255) in Dra Abu el-Naga. The royal couple are shown in an offering scene.Briant Bohleke, \\"Amenemopet Panehsi, Direct Successor of the Chief Treasurer Maya\\", Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 39, (2002), pp. 157-172 * One of the colossal statues in Karnak (north side of the 10th pylon) was made for Horemheb and depicted Mutnedjmet. The statue was later usurped and reinscribed for Ramesses II and Nefertari.Maya M√ºller, \\"√úber die B√ºste 23725 in Berlin\\", Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen, Bd. 31, (1989), pp. 7-24 * Mutnedjmet usurped several inscriptions of Ankhesenamun in Luxor.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 2004, , pg 156 * Statues (fragments) and other items including alabaster fragments naming Mutnodjemet were found in Horemheb's Saqqara tomb. Some items bear funerary texts.Geoffrey T. Martin, \\"Excavations at the Memphite Tomb of ·∏§orem·∏•eb, 1977: Preliminary Report\\", The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 64, (1978), pp. 5-9 Death and burial Mutnedjmet died soon after Year 13 of her husband's rule in her mid-40s based on a wine-jar docket found in a burial chamber of Horemheb tomb at Saqqara, in Memphis and a statue and other items of hers found here. The mummy was found in King Horemheb's unused Memphite tomb along with the mummy of a still-born, premature infant. She appears to have been buried in the Memphite tomb of Horemheb, alongside his first wife Amenia. Mutnedjmet's mummy shows she had given birth several times, but the last King of the 18th Dynasty did not have a living heir at the time of his demise. It has been suggested that she had a daughter who was simply not mentioned on any monuments. The presence of the infant along with Mutnedjmet in the tomb suggests that this queen died in childbirth. A canopic jar of the Queen is now located in the British Museum. It is possible that the tomb QV33 in the Valley of the Queens was originally built for her. The tomb is known as the tomb of an otherwise unknown Tanedjmet, but both cartouches with her name are damaged and the similar hieroglyphs for ta and mut allow for this interpretation.Elizabeth Thomas: \\"Was Queen Mutnedjmet the Owner of Tomb 33 in the Valley of the Queens?\\", The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 53, (Dec., 1967), pp. 161-163 In popular culture * The South African artist Winifred Brunton painted a portrait of this queen during the 1920s. * In Michelle Moran's novel, Nefertiti: A Novel, Mutnedjmet is the principal character as the younger sister of Queen Nefertiti.

The term has applications in aeronautics, shipping, and other fields.  Aeronautics  A propeller blade in feathered position In aeronautics, blade pitch refers to the angle of the blades of an aircraft propeller or helicopter rotor. Blade pitch is measured relative to the aircraft body. It is usually described as \\"fine\\" or \\"low\\" for a more vertical blade angle, and \\"coarse\\" or \\"high\\" for a greater horizontal blade angle. Blade pitch is normally described in units of distance/rotation assuming no slip. Blade pitch acts much like the gearing of the final drive of a car. Low pitch yields good low speed acceleration (and climb rate in an aircraft) while high pitch optimizes high speed performance and fuel economy. It is quite common for an aircraft to be designed with a variable-pitch propeller, to give maximum thrust over a larger speed range. A fine pitch would be used during take-off and landing, whereas a coarser pitch is used for high-speed cruise flight. This is because the effective angle of attack of the propeller blade decreases as airspeed increases. To maintain the optimum effective angle of attack, the pitch must be increased. Blade pitch angle is not the same as blade angle of attack. As speed increases, blade pitch is increased to keep blade angle of attack constant. A propeller blade's \\"lift\\", or its thrust, depends on the angle of attack combined with its speed. Because the velocity of a propeller blade varies from the hub to the tip, it is of twisted form in order for the thrust to remain approximately constant along the length of the blade; this is called \\"blade twist\\". This is typical of all but the crudest propellers. = Helicopters = In helicopters, pitch control changes the angle of incidence of the rotor blades, which in turn affects the blades' angle of attack. Main rotor pitch is controlled by both collective and cyclic, whereas tail rotor pitch is altered using pedals. = Feathering = Feathering the blades of a propeller means to increase their angle of pitch by turning the blades to be parallel to the airflow. This minimizes drag from a stopped propeller following an engine failure in flight. =Reverse thrust= Some propeller- driven aircraft permit the pitch to be decreased beyond the fine position until the propeller generates thrust in the reverse direction. This is called thrust reversal, and the propeller position is called the beta position.https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all- news/2017/march/pilot/turbine-reverse-thrust  Wind turbines  Ka Lae/South Point, Hawaii awaiting removal, with rotors stopped and blades feathered. Blade pitch control is a feature of nearly all large modern horizontal-axis wind turbines. It is used to adjust the rotation speed and the generated power. While operating, a wind turbine's control system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes. Feathering the blades stops the rotor during emergency shutdowns, or whenever the wind speed exceeds the maximum rated speed. During construction and maintenance of wind turbines, the blades are usually feathered to reduce unwanted rotational torque in the event of wind gusts. Blade pitch control is preferred over rotor brakes, as brakes are subject to failure or overload by the wind force on the turbine. This can lead to runaway turbines. By contrast, pitch control allows the blades to be feathered, so that wind speed does not affect the stress on the control mechanism. Pitch control can be implemented via hydraulic or electric mechanisms. Hydraulic mechanisms have longer life, faster response time due to higher driving force, and a lower maintenance backup spring. However, hydraulics tend to require more power to keep the system at a high pressure, and can leak. Electric systems consume and waste less power, and do not leak. However, they require costly fail safe batteries and capacitors in the event of power failure. Pitch control does not need to be active (reliant on actuators). Passive (stall-controlled) wind turbines rely on the fact that angle of attack increases with wind speed. Blades can be designed to stop functioning past a certain speed. This is another use for twisted blades: the twist allows for a gradual stall as each portion of the blade has a different angle of attack and will stop at a different time. Blade pitch control typically accounts for less than 3% of a wind turbine's expense while blade pitch malfunctions account for 23% of all wind turbine production downtime, and account for 21% of all component failures.  Shipping  In shipping, blade pitch is measured in the number of inches of forward propulsion through the water for one complete revolution of the propeller. For example, a propeller with a 12\\" pitch when rotated once, will propel the vessel 12\\" ahead. Note that this is the theoretical maximum distance; in reality, due to \\"slip\\" between the propeller and the water, the actual distance propelled will invariably be less.http://www.boatus.com/boattech/articles/propellers.asp Some composite propellers have interchangeable blades, which enables the blade pitch to be changed when the propeller is stopped.https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/boat-propellers-with- replaceable-interchangeable-blades A lower pitch would be used for transporting heavy loads at low speed, whereas a higher pitch would be used for high-speed travel.  Rowing (sport)  In rowing, blade pitch is the inclination of the blade towards the stern of the boat during the drive phase of the rowing stroke. Without correct blade pitch, a blade would have a tendency to dive too deep, or pop out of the water and/or cause difficulties with balancing on the recovery phase of the stroke.

The station is branded Merseyrail. The station is situated on the northern route of the Liverpool to Manchester Line, the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. It is a busy feeder station for nearby towns which no longer have railway stations, such as Golborne, Billinge and Haydock. There is also a complimentary bus shuttle service to Haydock Park Racecourse on certain racedays.http://haydock.thejockeyclub.co.uk/plan-your-race-day/visitor- information/directions-parking History The station was built in 1845https://www.sthelens.gov.uk/media/3373/listed-buildings-in-st-helens-with- maps-comp.pdf (p. 125, 126)Donaghy, TJ (1972).

The station was also well served by trains between and Liverpool Lime Street (many of which were routed via Leigh) and also to General via Warrington and the Birkenhead Joint Railway. The connections to the WCML also provided a useful diversionary route for trains to Preston & beyond from both Manchester & Liverpool - these were utilised by British Rail when they set up a Motorail terminal at the station in the 1960s, which offered through trains to Stirling\\"D1842 on the 08.55 Newton-le Willows to Stirling Motorail service in 1967\\"Railscot; Retrieved 30 March 2016 & Inverness and to .\\"Devon Memories\\"Derby Sulzers; Retrieved 30 March 2016 The station avoided the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, though the Warrington to Wigan local trains along the WCML ended in 1969 along with services via Leigh.

This finally changed over forty years later when the Liverpool to Manchester line via Chat Moss was electrified by Network Rail as part of the North West Electrification Programme. Commuter services which call at Newton-le-Willows have been operated by four car Class 319 electric multiple units since March 2015, with 3-car Class 323 units also now appearing on many services. Facilities Like most Merseytravel stations, it is staffed from start of service until the last train has left (closing just before midnight each evening).Newton-Le-Willows station facilities National Rail Enquiries There are also self-service ticket machines provided. There are shelters on both platforms, along with digital information screens and timetable poster boards. Services The May 2018 timetable change has seen a major upgrade of services here. TransPennine Express now operate an hourly fast Liverpool to via Manchester Victoria, and York that calls here (introduced as part of the new TPE franchise agreementTransPennine Express Franchise Improvements - DfT), whilst Northern's service between Liverpool and now runs to and calls at all intermediate stations between Liverpool and the Airport. At peak times there is also a limited local service to Manchester Victoria and a single evening train to via the Parkside West curve (a balancing service from there runs in the morning). Transport for Wales also serves the station once per hour each way (with peak extras) on its Manchester Airport/Manchester Piccadilly to and route, though a few trains run to and from (to connect with the ferry to Ireland). On Sundays the service frequency remains the same on all routes, though TfW trains only run to and from Chester. East Midland Trains services between Liverpool and Nottingham/Norwich services sometimes call here if their usual route via is closed for engineering work, with Warrington-bound passengers changing here for a rail-replacement bus connection. The new \\"Northern Connect\\" services from Chester to Leeds via Manchester Victoria and Bradford Interchange also stops at Newton-le-Willows following its introduction in May 2019. This runs hourly each way Mondays to Saturdays, with two trains running to/from rather than Chester at weekday peak times.

Biography Shiels was born in Maghera, County Londonderry, a town in the centre of Ulster in the north of Ireland. He was born into an Ulster-Scots Presbyterian family and arrived in Melbourne as a child in 1853. He was educated at Scotch College and the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in law and arts, gaining a master's degree in law in 1885. He was called to the Melbourne bar in 1872 and was also active in public life, being a noted campaigner for divorce law reform. Shiels was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Normanby in 1880, as a moderate liberal, holding that seat throughout his career. He was Attorney-General and Minister for Railways in the government of James Munro from 1890 to 1892. During this time Shiels was one of the few politicians to warn against the excesses of the Land Boom which swept Victoria between 1887 and 1891. As a result, when Munro suddenly resigned in the face of imminent bankruptcy in February 1892, the liberals turned to Shiels as a \\"clean\\" new leader, and he became Premier. The Shiels government responded to the financial disaster of the 1892 crash in the orthodox fashion of the time, cutting spending and increasing taxation to balance the budget ‚Äì measures which only made the situation worse. The conservatives who had supported the coalition governments of Duncan Gillies and Munro opposed increased taxation, and during 1892 they deserted Shiels. In January 1893 the conservative leader James Patterson moved a successful no- confidence motion, and Shiels resigned. Shiels stayed in politics and kept his reputation for integrity. He was Treasurer under Allan McLean (1899‚Äì1900) and William Irvine (1902‚Äì1903) and Minister for Railways (1903‚Äì1904). In 1904, however, his health broke down and he retired to rural South Australia shortly before his death, aged only 56. Shiels is buried at Struan House which is located on the Dukes HWY 10 km out of Naracoorte in South Australia's South East.

The seven-day official visit to three Chinese cities was the first time a U.S. president had visited the PRC; Nixon's arrival in Beijing ended 25 years of no communication or diplomatic ties between the two countries and was the key step in normalizing relations between the U.S. and China. Nixon visited China to gain more leverage over relations with the Soviet Union. The normalization of ties culminated in 1979, when the U.S. established full diplomatic relations with the PRC. Synopsis When the communists took over mainland China in 1949 and the nationalists fled to the island of Taiwan, the United States allied with, and recognized, the Republic of China as the sole government of China. Before his election as president in 1968, former Vice President Richard Nixon hinted at establishing a new relationship with the PRC. Early in his first term, Nixon, through his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, sent subtle overtures hinting at warmer relations to the PRC government. After a series of these overtures by both countries, Kissinger flew on secret diplomatic missions to Beijing in 1971, where he met with Premier Zhou Enlai. On July 15, 1971, the President shocked the world by announcing on live television that he would visit the PRC the following year. The week-long visit, from February 21 to 28, 1972, allowed the American public to view images of China for the first time in over two decades. Throughout the week the President and his senior advisers engaged in substantive discussions with the PRC leadership, including a meeting with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Chairman Mao Zedong, while First Lady Pat Nixon toured schools, factories and hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Hangzhou and Shanghai with the large American press corps in tow. Nixon dubbed his visit \\"the week that changed the world\\", a descriptor that continues to echo in the political lexicon. Repercussions of the Nixon visit continue to this day; while near-immediate results included a significant shift in the Cold War balance‚Äîdriving a wedge between the Soviet Union and China, resulting in significant Soviet concessions to the U.S.‚Äîthe trip spawned China's opening to the world and economic parity with capitalist countries. The relationship between China and the U.S. is now one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world, and every successive U.S. president, except Jimmy Carter, has visited China. The trip is consistently ranked by historians, scholars, and journalists as one of the most important‚Äîif not the most important‚Äîvisits by a U.S. president anywhere. Also, a \\"Nixon to China\\" moment has since become a metaphor to refer to the ability of a politician with an unassailable reputation among their supporters for representing and defending their values to take actions that would draw their criticism and even opposition if taken by someone without those credentials. Visit =Historical background= Improved relations with the Soviet Union and the PRC are often cited as the most successful diplomatic achievements of Nixon's presidency.Joan Hoff. Nixon Reconsidered (New York, NY: BasicBooks, 1994): 182. After World War II, Americans saw relations between the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorating, the Soviets consolidating communist allies over much of Eastern Europe, and the potential victory of Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War. The American ruling class was concerned that communists might dominate schools or labor unions. In China, from the beginning of the Sino-Soviet Split in 1956, there was a perceived necessity for external allies to counterbalance the power of the USSR. While the split was originally motivated, in part, by Mao's view of the Soviets as too accommodating toward the US, eventually he came to view the USSR as a greater threat to China's position. The reason for opening up China was for the U.S. to gain more leverage over relations with the Soviet Union. Resolving the Vietnam War was a particularly important factor. National Security Council staffer (and later U.S. Ambassador to China) Winston Lord noted: One of the main reasons Richard Nixon became the 1952 vice-presidential candidate on the Eisenhower ticket was his strong anti-communist stance. Despite this, in 1972 Nixon became the first U.S. president to visit mainland China while in office.Stephen E. Ambrose. Nixon, the Triumph of a Politician 1962‚Äì1972 (New York, NY: Simon and Schuster, 1989): 439. Ulysses S. Grant visited China on a world tour after leaving office. Herbert Hoover lived in China briefly in 1899 before becoming president and could speak Mandarin. Dwight D. Eisenhower made a state visit to Taiwan in 1960, during the period when the United States recognized the Republic of China government in Taipei as the sole government of China. =Readiness= In July 1971, President Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger secretly visited Beijing during a trip to Pakistan, and laid the groundwork for Nixon's visit to China. This meeting was arranged and facilitated by Pakistan through its strong diplomatic channels with China. Transcripts of White House meetings and once confidential documents show Nixon began working to open a channel of communication with Beijing from his first day in the White House. For this ambitious goal to be reached President Nixon had carried out a series of carefully calibrated moves through Communist China's allies Romania and Pakistan. Travel to China Air Force One landing in Beijing on February 21, 1972. \\"I remember that when we landed at Beijing Airport, maybe naively I was somewhat disappointed at what I considered the strained nature of the Chinese reception. We had expected thousands of people in cheering crowds, after 22 years of hostilities. There was a very small crowd, including a Chinese Army honor guard. Looking out the window at the welcoming ceremony, I thought that it was a fairly gray day, too. This didn't look like a monumental event, as it ought to have been.\\" ‚Äì Winston Lord Pat Nixon in Beijing Mr. Nixon, his wife, and their entourage left the White House on February 17, 1972, spending a night in Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station, Oahu, Hawaii. They arrived the next day in Guam at 5 pm, where they spent the night at Nimitz Hill, the residence of the Commander, Naval Forces, Marianas. The next morning, February 21, at 7 am the Nixons left Guam for Shanghai. After 4 hours in the air, the Nixons arrived in Shanghai. From Shanghai, the Nixons traveled to Beijing. =Meeting with Mao= From February 21 to 28, 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon traveled to Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. Almost as soon as the American president arrived in the Chinese capital, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong summoned him for a quick meeting. Secretary of State William P. Rogers was excluded from this meeting and the only other American present besides Kissinger was Kissinger's assistant Winston Lord. To avoid embarrassing Rogers, Lord was cropped out of all the official photographs of the meeting.Kissinger Years of Upheaval p. 65 > They figured that it was humiliating enough that the National Security > Adviser was with the President at this historic meeting, but the Secretary > of State was not. To add on top of that the fact that the Special Assistant > to the National Security Adviser was there as a third person but the > Secretary of State was not was too much, even for them. The Chinese clearly > must have been puzzled by this, but they readily went along with this > request. Although Nixon was in China for a week, this would be his only meeting with the top Chinese leader. Unknown to Nixon and the rest of the American diplomats at the time, Mao was in poor health and he had been hospitalized for several weeks up to only nine days before Nixon's arrival. Nevertheless, Mao felt well enough to insist to his officials that he would meet with Nixon upon his arrival. Upon being introduced to Nixon for the first time, Mao, speaking through his translator, said to Nixon: \\"I believe our old friend Chiang Kai- shek would not approve of this\\". As an observer of the Mao‚ÄìNixon meeting, Lord noted: Nixon held many meetings with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai during the trip, which included visits to the Great Wall, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. Nixon's porcelain swans statue, a gift to Mao, was presented along the way in the gift-giving ceremony. After his trip, the United States and the PRC governments issued the Shanghai Communiqu√©, a statement of their foreign policy views and a document that has remained the basis of Sino-American bilateral relations. Kissinger stated that the U.S. also intended to pull all its forces out of the island of Taiwan.http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events- of-1972/1972-Election/12305688736666-2/#title \\"Nixon Goes to China\\". Accessed 2009-04-15. Archived 2009-05-05. In the communiqu√©, both nations pledged to work toward the full normalization of diplomatic policy. =Results= Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai speaking at a banquet at the Great Hall of the People Nixon shakes hands with Chinese leader Mao Zedong The Chinese agreed to a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. The statement enabled the U.S. and PRC to temporarily set aside the \\"crucial question obstructing the normalization of relations\\"Nixon's China's Visit and \\"Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqu√©\\" concerning the political status of Taiwan and to open trade and other contacts. However, the U.S. continued to maintain official relations with the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan and did not break off until 1979, when the U.S. established full diplomatic relations with the PRC. While in Shanghai, Nixon spoke about what this meant for the two countries in the future: > This was the week that changed the world, as what we have said in that > Communique is not nearly as important as what we will do in the years ahead > to build a bridge across 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostilities which have > divided us in the past. And what we have said today is that we shall build > that bridge. Nixon and his aides carefully planned the trip to have the biggest possible impact on television audiences in the United States. The media coverage of the trip was overwhelmingly positive. Later interviews with correspondents who traveled with the President show how eager they were to be on the trip, which some labeled the most important summit meeting ever. Richard Nixon wrote many books about his international contributions and accomplishments. Beyond Peace is the last of his post-career volumes, addressing the need for the United States in a world transformed by the collapse of the Communist bloc. John T. Downey and Richard Fecteau, CIA operatives who were held captive in China from November 1952, were released after Nixon's visit to China. Aftermath Nixon's visit to China was well-planned, virtually choreographed. The media played a vital role in assuring Americans back home, who were able to see Nixon communicating with Chinese government officials, attending dinners, and being accorded tours with other people of influence. As Nixon played the role of an international statesman, Americans paused, observed, and grew in respect for Nixon. Because of this visually televised confirmation that citizens were receiving on the daily national news, presidential approval ratings rose to almost 56 percent.Gallup, Inc. \\"Presidential Approval Ratings\\". Gallup.com, Gallup, 10 January 2017, http://news.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential- approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx After his return from a packed week of meetings and photo opportunities, American citizens were asked what they thought the impact of this trip would have on the role of the United States internationally. In a poll taken in March 1972 conducted by Gallup, the results stated that more than fifty percent of the group found the trip effective in terms of improving world peace. Max Frankel of The New York Times received the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his coverage of the event. The visit inspired John Adams' 1987 opera Nixon in China. It was also the subject of a PBS documentary film, American Experience: Nixon's China Game.

Systematic reviews formulate research questions that are broad or narrow in scope, and identify and synthesize studies that directly relate to the systematic review question. They are designed to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current evidence, published and unpublished, that is \\"methodical, comprehensive, transparent, and replicable.\\" An understanding of systematic reviews and how to implement them in practice is highly recommended for professionals involved in the delivery of health care, public health, and public policy. Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials are key to the practice of evidence-based medicine, and a review of existing studies is often quicker and cheaper than embarking on a new study. Contrastingly, systematic reviews of observational studies rank lower in the evidence-based hierarchy. However, another important factor that impacts the quality of the evidence is the accuracy of the methodological design and execution of the systematic review carried out by the authors. While systematic reviews are often applied in the biomedical or healthcare context, they can be used in other areas where an assessment of a precisely defined subject would be helpful. For example, systematic reviews are becoming increasingly common in management, accounting and finance. Systematic reviews may examine clinical tests, public health interventions, environmental interventions, social interventions, adverse effects, and economic evaluations. Characteristics A systematic review aims to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current literature relevant to a research question. The first step in conducting a systematic review is to create a structured question to guide the review. The second step is to perform a thorough search of the literature for relevant papers. The Methodology section of a systematic review will list all of the databases and citation indexes that were searched such as Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed and any individual journals that were searched. The searching of different databases is a hallmark of clinical trials. In this regard, more recently there has been increased recognition of the importance of using different search technologies, with artificial intelligence-based tools gaining recognition. The titles and abstracts of identified articles are checked against pre-determined criteria for eligibility and relevance to form an inclusion set. This set will relate back to the research problem. Each included study may be assigned an objective assessment of methodological quality preferably by using methods conforming to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (the current guideline) or the high quality standards of Cochrane. Systematic reviews often, but not always, use statistical techniques (meta-analysis) to combine results of eligible studies, or at least use scoring of the levels of evidence depending on the methodology used. An additional rater may be consulted to resolve any scoring differences between raters. Systematic review is often applied in the biomedical or healthcare context, but it can be applied in any field of research. Groups like the Campbell Collaboration are promoting the use of systematic reviews in policy-making beyond just healthcare. A systematic review uses an objective and transparent approach for research synthesis, with the aim of minimizing bias. While many systematic reviews are based on an explicit quantitative meta-analysis of available data, there are also qualitative reviews which adhere to standards for gathering, analyzing and reporting evidence. The EPPI-Centre has been influential in developing methods for combining both qualitative and quantitative research in systematic reviews. The PRISMA statement suggests a standardized way to ensure a transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews, and is now required for this kind of research by more than 170 medical journals worldwide. Developments in systematic reviews during the 21st century included realist reviews and the meta-narrative approach, both of which addressed problems of methods and heterogeneity existing on some subjects. =Scoping reviews= Scoping reviews are distinct from systematic reviews in a number of important ways. A scoping review is an attempt to search for concepts, mapping the language which surrounds those and adjusting the search method iteratively. A scoping review may often be a preliminary stage before a systematic review, which 'scopes' out an area of inquiry and maps the language and key concepts. As it is a kind of review which should be systematically conducted (the method is repeatable), some academic publishers categorize them as a kind of 'systematic review', which may cause confusion. Scoping reviews are helpful when it is not possible to carry out a systematic synthesis of research findings, for example, when there are no published clinical trials in the area of inquiry. Scoping reviews are a helpful method when an area of inquiry is very broad, for example, exploring how the public are involved in all stages systematic reviews. There is still a lack of clarity when defining the exact method of scoping review as it is both an iterative process and is still relatively new and there have been a number of attempts to improve the standardisation of the method. PROSPERO does not permit the submission of protocols of scoping reviews, although some journals will publish protocols for scoping reviews.  Stages  The main stages of a systematic review are: # Defining a question and agreeing an objective method. It is considered best practice to publish the protocol of the systematic review before initiating it in order to help avoid unplanned duplication and to enable comparison of reported review methods with what was planned in the protocol. # A search for relevant data from research that matches certain criteria. For example, only selecting research that is good quality and answers the defined question. Contacting a trained information professional or librarian can improve the quality of the systematic review. # 'Extraction' of relevant data. This can include how the research was done (often called the method or 'intervention'), who participated in the research (including how many people), how it was paid for (for example funding sources) and what happened (the outcomes). # Assess the quality of the data by judging it against criteria identified at the first stage. This can include assessing the quality (or certainty) of evidence, using criteria such as GRADE. # Analyse and combine the data (using complex statistical methods) which give an overall result from all of the data. This combination of data can be visualised using a blobbogram (also called a forest plot). The diamond in the blobbogram represents the combined results of all the data included. Because this combined result uses data from more sources than just one data set, it's considered more reliable and better evidence, as the more data there is, the more confident we can be of conclusions. Once these stages are complete, the review may be published, disseminated and translated into practice after being adopted as evidence. = Living systematic reviews = Living systematic reviews are a relatively new kind of high quality, semi-automated, up-to-date online summaries of research which are updated as new research becomes available. The essential difference between 'living systematic review' and conventional systematic review is the publication format. Living systematic reviews are 'dynamic, persistent, online-only evidence summaries, which are updated rapidly and frequently'. Research fields =Medicine and biology=  History  In 1753, James Lind published A Treatise on the Scurvy, a study which he described in the subtitle as A Critical and Chronological View of What has been Published on the Subject. This is the first which can be said as systematic review. Lind comments, \\"It became requisite to exhibit a full and impartial view of what had hitherto been published on the scurvy,\\" and, \\"before the subject could be set in a clear and proper light, it was necessary to remove a great deal of rubbish.\\" The first proper analysis of different sources was a report made by Karl Pearson in 1904. Pearson analysed the effectiveness of typhoid vaccine from five studies of immunity and six studies of mortality. What amazed him was the irregularity of the data. He wrote: This is considered as the first analysis of clinical trials using what is later known as meta-analysis. In 1925, Ronald Fisher introduced the statistical method (probability) for such analysis in his book Statistical Methods for Research Workers. A colleague of Fisher, William Gemmell Cochran made an improved method in 1937. With Frank Yates, Cochran reported analysis of agricultural data in 1938 titled \\"The analysis of groups of experiments\\" using the new method. In 1974, Archie Cochrane and colleagues made analysis of the use of aspirin in the prevention of heart attack (myocardial infarction). This became one of the most influential systematic analysis in randomized controlled trial. In 1979, Archie Cochrane wrote 'It is surely a great criticism of our profession that we have not organised a critical summary, by specialty or subspecialty, adapted periodically, of all relevant randomised controlled trials'. Critical appraisal and synthesis of research findings in a systematic way emerged in the 1970s after Gene V. Glass introduced the term 'meta analysis' in 1976. According to Glass, meta-analysis is \\"the statistical analysis of a large collection of analysis results from individual studies for the purpose of integrating the findings\\". Early syntheses were conducted in broad areas of public policy and social interventions, with systematic research synthesis applied to medicine and health. The Cochrane Collaboration was founded in 1993, building on the work by Iain Chalmers and colleagues in the area of pregnancy and childbirth.  Contemporary  Named after Archie Cochrane, Cochrane is a group of over 37,000 specialists in healthcare who systematically review randomised trials of the effects of prevention, treatments and rehabilitation as well as health systems interventions. When appropriate, they also include the results of other types of research. Cochrane Reviews are published in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews section of the Cochrane Library. The 2015 impact factor for The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was 6.103, and it was ranked 12th in the ‚ÄúMedicine, General & Internal‚Äù category.The Cochrane Library. 2015 impact factor. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) Retrieved 2016-07-20. There are six types of Cochrane Review:Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer program]. Version 5.2. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2012.The Cochrane Library # Intervention reviews assess the benefits and harms of interventions used in healthcare and health policy. # Diagnostic test accuracy reviews assess how well a diagnostic test performs in diagnosing and detecting a particular disease. # Methodology reviews address issues relevant to how systematic reviews and clinical trials are conducted and reported. # Qualitative reviews synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence to address questions on aspects other than effectiveness. # Prognosis reviews address the probable course or future outcome(s) of people with a health problem. # Overviews of systematic reviews (OoRs) are a new type of study in order to compile multiple evidence from systematic reviews into a single document that is accessible and useful to serve as a friendly front end for the Cochrane Collaboration with regard to healthcare decision-making. The Cochrane Collaboration provides a handbook for systematic reviewers of interventions which \\"provides guidance to authors for the preparation of Cochrane Intervention reviews.\\" The Cochrane Handbook outlines eight general steps for preparing a systematic review: # Defining the review question(s) and developing criteria for including studies # Searching for studies # Selecting studies and collecting data # Assessing risk of bias in included studies # Analysing data and undertaking meta-analyses # Addressing reporting biases # Presenting results and \\"summary of findings\\" tables # Interpreting results and drawing conclusions The Cochrane Handbook forms the basis of two sets of standards for the conduct and reporting of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR - Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews) The Cochrane Library is a collection of databases in medicine and other health care specialties provided by Cochrane and other organizations. It is the collection of Cochrane Reviews, a database of systematic reviews and meta- analyses which summarize and interpret the results of medical research. It was originally published by Update Software and now published by the share-holder owned publisher John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. as part of Wiley Online Library. Authors must pay an additional fee for their review to be truly open access. Cochrane has an annual income of $10m USD. = Social sciences = The quasi- standard for systematic review in the social sciences is based on the procedures proposed by the Campbell Collaboration, which is one of a number of groups promoting evidence-based policy in the social sciences. The Campbell Collaboration \\"helps people make well-informed decisions by preparing, maintaining and disseminating systematic reviews in education, crime and justice, social welfare and international development. It is a sister initiative of Cochrane. The Campbell Collaboration was created in 2000 and the inaugural meeting in Philadelphia, USA, attracted 85 participants from 13 countries. In 1959, social scientist and social work educator Barbara Wootton published one of the first contemporary systematic reviews of literature on anti-social behavior as part of her work, Social Science and Social Pathology. = Business and economics = Due to the different nature of research fields outside of the natural sciences, the aforementioned methodological steps cannot easily be applied in business research. Early attempts to transfer the procedures from medicine to business research have been made by Tranfield et al. (2003). A step-by-step approach has been developed by Durach et al.: Based on the experiences they have made in their own discipline, these authors have adapted the methodological steps and developed a standard procedure for conducting systematic literature reviews in business and economics. Strengths and weaknesses While systematic reviews are regarded as the strongest form of medical evidence, a review of 300 studies found that not all systematic reviews were equally reliable, and that their reporting can be improved by a universally agreed upon set of standards and guidelines. A further study by the same group found that of 100 systematic reviews monitored, 7% needed updating at the time of publication, another 4% within a year, and another 11% within 2 years; this figure was higher in rapidly changing fields of medicine, especially cardiovascular medicine. A 2003 study suggested that extending searches beyond major databases, perhaps into grey literature, would increase the effectiveness of reviews. Additionally, errors in abstracting study design and baseline characteristics can be reduced through adjudication or independent abstraction, yet that does not adequately handle inconsistencies in data related to outcomes or results. Roberts and colleagues highlighted the problems with systematic reviews, particularly those conducted by the Cochrane, noting that published reviews are often biased, out of date and excessively long. They criticized Cochrane reviews as not being sufficiently critical in the selection of trials and including too many of low quality. They proposed several solutions, including limiting studies in meta-analyses and reviews to registered clinical trials, requiring that original data be made available for statistical checking, paying greater attention to sample size estimates, and eliminating dependence on only published data. Some of these difficulties were noted early on as described by Altman: \\"much poor research arises because researchers feel compelled for career reasons to carry out research that they are ill equipped to perform, and nobody stops them.\\" Methodological limitations of meta-analysis have also been noted. Until now, there was no standardized methods to be used by researchers and the optimal methodological steps should be standardized. Another concern is that the methods used to conduct a systematic review are sometimes changed once researchers see the available trials they are going to include. Bloggers have described retractions of systematic reviews and published reports of studies included in published systematic reviews. Systematic reviews are increasingly prevalent in other fields, such as international development research. Subsequently, a number of donors ‚Äì most notably the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and AusAid ‚Äì are focusing more attention and resources on testing the appropriateness of systematic reviews in assessing the impacts of development and humanitarian interventions. = Limited reporting of clinical trials = The 'All Trials' campaign highlights that around half of clinical trials have never reported results and works to improve reporting. This lack of reporting has extremely serious implications for research, including systematic reviews, as it is only possible to synthesize data of published trials. In addition, positive trials were twice as likely to be published as those with negative results. At present, it is legal for for-profit companies to conduct clinical trials and not publish the results. For example, in the past 10 years 8.7 million patients have taken part in trials that have not published results. These factors mean that it is likely there is a significant publication bias, with only 'positive' or perceived favorable results being published. A recent systematic review of industry sponsorship and research outcomes concluded that 'sponsorship of drug and device studies by the manufacturing company leads to more favorable efficacy results and conclusions than sponsorship by other sources' and that the existence of an industry bias that cannot be explained by standard 'Risk of bias' assessments. Systematic reviews of such a bias may amplify the effect, although the flaw is in the reporting of research, not in the systematic review process.

Seine-et-Marne, France, and worked seventeen years in Denmark as an architect to the royal court. He introduced neoclassicism to Denmark.  Early training and student tour to Italy  According to Jardin's own statement he began his architectural studies at the age of ten. It is confirmed by independent source that he started his training at the French Academy of Architecture (Acad√©mie royale d'architecture) no later than in 1738, perhaps before. He studied under A.C. Mollet, and won the grand prize (Prix de Rome) for architecture at 22 years of age for his design of a choir or chancel in a cathedral. The prize won him a travel stipend, which he used to travel to Italy in 1744. There he studied at the French Academy in Rome 1744-1748, while living at the Academy's pension. At the same time he studied mathematics and geometry with Jesuit priest and physicist Ruggero Joseph Boscovich, and graphics presumably with Giuseppe Vasi. He may also have studied engineering while in Rome. In Italy he was friends with fellow countryman, sculptor Jacques Fran√ßois Joseph Saly who was also on student tour at the time. Saly would play an important role in his future only a few years later. They were both influenced by contemporary Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and the current infatuation with Roman ruins that were seen as a reminder of a common European past, and could be the inspiration for a new universal design style. He was resident architect with Michel Tannevot in Paris 1753-1754.  Iconography * A painting by Jean Barbault showing Jardin as Ambassador of Persia, Beauvais, Mus√©e d√©partemental de l'Oise, for the Masacarade of 1748.  Royal invitation to work in Denmark  His friend and countryman, sculptor Jacques Fran√ßois Joseph Saly who had been summoned to work in Denmark in 1752 for the royal court, brought Jardin to the attention of King Frederik V as the suitable choice to replace Nicolai Eigtved for the design and building of Frederik's Church (Frederikskirke), now known as The Marble Church (Marmorkirken), work on which had begun in 1749. A contract to bring Jardin to Denmark was concluded on 12 October 1754, a few months after Eigtved's death, and included a considerable annual wage for both him and his young, inexperienced brother Louis Henri Jardin. The brothers came to Copenhagen that same autumn, and they both were named members of the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) on 15 January 1755. They were also named professors at the school of the Academy, where story goes, on account of their inability to speak Danish, they held lectures in French to an audience of students that didn't understand them. This was, however, not unusual at the time, as many of the Academy's teachers were foreigners, especially French, including its Director, friend Jacques Saly. Nicolas-Henri was professor in architecture, and his brother was professor in perspective from 1755.  Frederik‚Äôs Church and other assignments On 1 April 1756 Jardin took over project leadership on Frederik's Church. His first set of building drawings were different from anything one had previously seen in Denmark, and anticipated the later styles of Claude Nicolas Ledoux and √âtienne-Louis Boull√©e. The plans, however, were rejected on account of the exorbitant expense required to carry them out. He presented a new set of drawings at Fredensborg Palace summer 1756, which the King accepted, in spite of the Royal Building Commission's opinion that these plans also were too expensive. The King committed funds to the project, although full funding was never realised. The plans were monumental, and work went slowly. In 1760 after predecessor Lauritz de Thurah‚Äôs death, Nicolas-Henri was named Royal Building Master with responsibility over all royal castles and buildings, as well as parks in Denmark, a position he held until 1770. He also took over the interior decoration (1756-1759) of powerful statesman and leader Court Marshal (Hofmarshal) Adam Gottlob Moltke‚Äôs palace, the Moltke Palace, today known as Christian VII‚Äôs Palace, at Amalienborg, after Nicolai Eigtved died in 1754. His younger brother died at Charlottenborg 1759 at the age of 29. Nicolas- Henri overtook his teaching position. Prior to 1760 he became an honorary member of the academies in Florence and Bologna. In 1759 he began work on Bernstorff Palace near Gentofte (1759‚Äì1765) and Lundehave, now known as Marienlyst Castle in Helsing√∏r (1758‚Äì1762). The work on the garden at Bernstorff Palace, done in cooperation with Joachim Wasserschlebe took until 1768 to complete. In 1762 he became a corresponding member of the French Academy of Art in Paris. 1762‚Äì1763 he traveled to France. In 1764 Frederick‚Äôs Church stood only 9.4 meters above the foundation. In 1765 he published a large folio of copperplate etchings called \\"Plans, coup√©s et elevations de l'√©glise royale de Fr√©d√©ric V\\".  A change in the royal chambers  King Frederik V, his loyal supporter, died on 14 January 1766 and the young, unstable Christian VII became king. 1768-1769 he traveled to France, England, Holland and Belgium, partly in the company of Johannes Wiedewelt. Prior to 1769 he became an honorary member of the Academy in Marseille. In 1769 he received the Order of Saint Michael in France. In 1770 it was estimated that, at the then current rate of building activity, the Frederik's Church exterior would not be complete until 1797, and the interior would take a further 50 years to complete. Due to Johann Friedrich Struensee‚Äôs cost-cutting measures, a royal resolution was made on 9 November 1770 that building activity would be stopped for a period of time. Scaffolding, machines and material were sold at public auction, and Jardin was relieved of his duty as Church Building Master with severance pay.  Departure from Denmark, return to France  Struensee fell from power at the beginning of 1771, and the country's general mood turned against all foreigners in positions of power. Jardin resigned his professorship at the Academy on 26 March 1771 and left Denmark. His students at the Academy had included Caspar Frederik Harsdorff, Georg Erdmann Rosenberg, Christian Josef Zuber, and Hans N√¶ss. His friend and Director of the Academy for over 17 years, Jacques Saly, resigned from his post three months later. Jardin was named an extraordinary member of the Academy in 1772. On 23 December 1771 he became a member of the French Academy of Art in Paris. On 11 May 1778 he was named Royal Architect by King Louis XV. On 10 March 1792 he became a member first class of the French Academy of Art in Paris. During the French Revolution‚Äôs Reign of Terror (1793-1794) Jardin retired to his home town. He died in 1799.

It has an extent of 344.44 km2 with four ranges namely Sulthan Bathery, Muthanga, Kurichiat and Tholpetty. A variety of large wild animals such as Indian bison, elephant, deer and tiger are found there. There are also quite a few unusual birds in the sanctuary. In particular, peafowl tend to be very common in the area. Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is the second largest wildlife sanctuary in Kerala. It is bestowed with lush green forests and rich wildlife.This wildlife area houses some of the rare and endangered species of both flora and fauna. Established in 1973, the sanctuary is now an integral part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. It is bounded by protected area network of Nagarhole and Bandipur of Karnataka in the northeast, and on the southeast by Mudumalai of Tamil Nadu. It is part of the Deccan Plateau and the vegetation is predominantly of the south Indian moist deciduous teak forests. Also, the sanctuary has pastures of the west-coast semi-evergreen trees. The wildlife sanctuary comes under Protect Elephant and one can spot herd of elephants roaming in the area. Elephant rides are arranged by the Kerala Forest Department. Wayanad district has the largest population of Adivasi in Kerala. Scheduled tribes here include Paniyas, Kurumas, Adiyans, Kurichiyas, Ooralis and Kattunaikkans. Comprising an area of 2126 km2, Wayanad has a powerful history. Relicts and edicts found in various parts of Wayanad speak of an important prehistoric era. Historians are of the view that organised human life existed in these parts, at least ten centuries before Christ. The sanctuary is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The Western Ghats, Nilgiri Sub-Cluster (6,000+ km¬≤), including all of the sanctuary, is under consideration by the World Heritage Committee for selection as a World Heritage Site.UNESCO, World Heritage sites, Tentative lists, Western Ghats sub cluster, Niligiris. retrieved 20 April 2007 World Heritage sites, Tentative lists A monitoring programme of the Forest Department for 2017-18 has found that the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS), holds the largest tiger population in the State. Of the total 176 tigers in the State, 75 were identified from the WWS, which is part of a large forest complex holding the single largest population of tigers in India.https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-wildlife- sanctuary-is-tiger-kingdom-of-the-state/article27130761.ece Welcome to Muthanga History Map of Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve, showing Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary in relation to multiple contiguous protected areas Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in 1973 and was brought under the Project Elephant in 1991‚Äì92. This sanctuary occupies an area of 345 km2. It is the second largest one in the state of Kerala. The sanctuary is separated into two disconnected parts known as the North Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and South Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. The area in between the two parts was originally a forest region, though it is now occupied majorly by plantations. In 2012, a tiger was shot dead by the Kerala Forest Department on a coffee plantation on the fringes of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. Many local political leaders applauded the killing of the tiger. Chief Wildlife Warden of Kerala ordered the hunt for the animal after mass protests erupted as the tiger had been carrying away domestic animals. Flora and fauna Indian peafowl in Tholpetty area. Flora: Moist deciduous forest consists of maruthi, karimaruthi, rosewood, venteak, vengal, chadachi, mazhukanjiram, bamboos, more, while the semi-evergreen patches comprises veteria indica., lagerstroemia, lanceolata, termianalia paniculata. Fauna: Elephants, tigers, panthers, jungle cats, civet cats, monkeys, wild dogs, bisons, deer, bears, monitor lizards and a variety of snakes are seen. Avian-Fauna: Peacocks, babblers, cuckoos, owls, woodpeckers, jungle fowls are a few of the various types of birds seen here. Climate Wayanad climate is salubrious. Average rain fall in this district is 2322 m.m. Annual rain fall in these high rain fall areas ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 mm. High velocity winds are common during the south west monsoon and dry winds blow in March‚ÄìApril. High altitude regions experience severe cold. This place experiences a high relative humidity which goes even up to 95 per cent during the south west monsoon period. Generally, the year is classified into four seasons, namely, cold weather, hot weather, south west monsoon and north east monsoon. The dale, 'Lakkidi', nestled among the hills of Vythiri taluk has the highest average rainfall in Kerala. Location: The south Wayanad division is located 16 km east of Sulthan Bathery and north wayanad division 20 km from Mananthavady in the state of Kerala. Visiting time: Everyday 7.00 am - 5.00 pm.  Threatened Status of Vultures  Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the safest havens for different species of vultures like the White-rumped Vultures and the Red- headed Vultures. The collective population of these vultures numbered around 150 in February 2016 dropped to about 70 in March 2016. A survey last year counted as many as 17 vulture nests, however, this number reduced to about 11 vulture nests in March 2016. The banned drug Diclofenac is believed to be the reason for this fall in the vulture count.

He was Minister of Defence from 30 June 1924 to 29 March 1933. Early life and family The son of Edmund Creswell, Deputy Postmaster-General at Gibraltar and Surveyor of the Mediterranean, by his marriage to Mary M. W. Fraser, Creswell was born in Gibraltar and educated in England at Bruce Castle, Derby School, and the Royal School of Mines.'Creswell, Lt-Col Hon. Frederic Hugh Page', in Who Was Who 1941‚Äì1950 (London: A. & C. Black, 1980 reprint: ) Creswell's brother Edmund (1849‚Äì1931) played for the Royal Engineers in the first FA Cup Final in 1872. Another brother, William (1852‚Äì1933), became a vice-admiral and is known as the \\"father\\" of the Royal Australian Navy. Career Creswell worked as a mining engineer in Venezuela, Asia Minor, Rhodesia and the Transvaal before becoming manager of the Durban Deep Mine, at Roodepoort. At the outset of the Second Boer War in 1899 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the newly raised Imperial Light Horse. When mining on the Witwatersrand began again, he became General Manager of the Village Main Reef Mine. After strongly opposing Chinese labourers being imported to the Transvaal, he resigned as manager in 1903, going on to take a leading role in the campaign to end the use of Chinese labour and ‚Äúbecame the champion of the white labourer‚Äù, advocating the use of white labour, and white immigration, as the solution to South Africa's labour problems.https://www.oliveschreiner.org/vre?view=personae&entry;=244 At the general election of 1910 he was elected to the House of Assembly of the Union Parliament, representing the new South African Labour Party, of which he was leader from 1910 to 1929. He remained an Assembly member until 1938. He was arrested and imprisoned for a month for his role in supporting miners' strikes in 1913 and 1914. The Smuts government suppression of the strikes influenced Creswell and Labour to develop an alliance with J.B.M. Hertzog and the National Party with Labour joining a National Party-led coalition government as junior partner, resulting in Creswell entering the cabinet. As well as serving as the South African Minister of Defence from 1924 to March 1933, Creswell was simultaneously Minister of Labour from 1924 to 1925 and again from 1929 to 1933. The alliance with the Nationalists eventually led to a split in the Labour Party when Hertzog dropped Labour MP Walter Madeley from the cabinet in 1928 due to his support for the multiracial Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union. Creswell and his supporters remained in government and became known as the \\"Creswell Labour\\" faction while Madeley and other Labour MPs joined the Opposition and became known as \\"National Council Labour\\" due to their being supported by the Labour Party's national council. In 1933, the Creswell Labour faction dissolved with its members joining the Hertzog's party. Following the 1933 general election, Hertzog formed a coalition with Smuts and his South African Party, with the parties merging to form the United Party, resulting in Creswell being left out of cabinet. He remained a member of the House of Assembly until 1938 when he left politics. In 1935 he was President of the Annual Conference of the International Labour Organization held at Geneva. =First World War service= During the South-West Africa campaign of 1914‚Äì1915, Creswell was second in command of the Rand Rifles. From 1916 to 1917 he commanded the 8th South African Infantry in the East African campaign, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Private life In 1920, Creswell married Margaret, daughter of the Rev. H. Boys, formerly Rector of Layer Marney. They had no children. Creswell died on 25 August 1948 in Kuilsrivier. His ashes were interred in the Garden of Remembrance in Epping, near Cape Town.Beyers C.J., Dictionary of South African Biography, Volume V, Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria, 1987 A Fast Attack Craft of the South African Navy was named after him.

It was named after the German engineer Ernst Heinrich Wilhelm Schmidt (1892‚Äì1975). The Schmidt number is the ratio of the shear component for diffusivity viscosity/density to the diffusivity for mass transfer D. It physically relates the relative thickness of the hydrodynamic layer and mass-transfer boundary layer. It is defined Eq. 6.71. as: :\\\\mathrm{Sc} = \\\\frac{ u}{D} = \\\\frac {\\\\mu} {\\\\rho D} = \\\\frac{ \\\\mbox{viscous diffusion rate} }{ \\\\mbox{molecular (mass) diffusion rate} } where: * u is the kinematic viscosity or ({\\\\mu}/{\\\\rho}\\\\,) in units of (m2/s) * D is the mass diffusivity (m2/s). * {\\\\mu} is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa¬∑s or N¬∑s/m¬≤ or kg/m¬∑s) * \\\\rho is the density of the fluid (kg/m¬≥). The heat transfer analog of the Schmidt number is the Prandtl number (Pr). The ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity is the Lewis number (Le). Turbulent Schmidt Number The turbulent Schmidt number is commonly used in turbulence research and is defined as: :\\\\mathrm{Sc}_\\\\mathrm{t} = \\\\frac{ u_\\\\mathrm{t}}{K} where: * u_\\\\mathrm{t} is the eddy viscosity in units of (m2/s) * K is the eddy diffusivity (m2/s). The turbulent Schmidt number describes the ratio between the rates of turbulent transport of momentum and the turbulent transport of mass (or any passive scalar). It is related to the turbulent Prandtl number which is concerned with turbulent heat transfer rather than turbulent mass transfer. It is useful for solving the mass transfer problem of turbulent boundary layer flows. The simplest model for Sct is the Reynolds analogy, which yields a turbulent Schmidt number of 1. From experimental data and CFD simulations, Sct ranges from 0.2 to 0.5. An assessment of the existing literature on the subject still indicates significant uncertainty concerning the correct specification of this variable . Stemming from the experimental and numerical evidence of its local variability, a new formulation for the turbulent Schmidt number, consisting in computing it locally, was proposed . Through the latter, directly depending on the strain-rate and the vorticity invariants, a stronger relation between the concentration and the turbulence fields was finally ensured . Stirling engines For Stirling engines, the Schmidt number is related to the specific power.

It serves as a way of contacting the SHPOs as well as a way for the SHPOs to communicate with each other.National Conference of State Historic Preservation Office, About NCSHPO National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, (May 9, 2008). The mission of the NCSHPO is to act as a national representative for the SHPOs, especially when it comes to representing their interests in Washington.King, Thomas F. Cultural Resource Laws and Practice, 2nd Edition, (Lanham, Maryland: AltaMira Press, 2004), 43. The NCSHPO meets once a year and participants include not only SHPOs, but members of Preservation Action and the National Alliance of Preservation Commissions, National Trust for Historic Preservation Advisors and federal agencies. Participants are updated on important legislative issues and then visit Capitol Hill with the information, to meet with their Representatives and Senators to establish favorable positions on these issues.National Conference of State Historic Preservation Office, Meeting Information , National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, (May 9, 2008). Generally the President of the NCSHPO is a previous member of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) while the Board of Directors, which governs NCSHPO, is elected by the member states and meets more frequently than once a year. It acts as a representative for them with federal agencies and national preservation organizations. It is important to have a close relationship with these federal agencies and national organizations, and NCSHPO maintains these by partnering closely with organizations such as: The ACHP, The National Park Service, The National Trust for Historic Preservation and Preservation Action.National Conference of State Historic Preservation Office, ‚ÄúAbout NCSHPO,‚Äù (May 9, 2008).

It is joined to the mainland at its south eastern edge by the railway causeway across Sandbrook Inlet. At the other end of this causeway is the Sydney suburb of Brooklyn in Hornsby Shire, to which Long Island belongs. Other islands in the Hawkesbury River include Dangar Island, Spectacle Island, Milson Island, Peat Island and Lion Island. As with Spectacle Island and Lion Island, Long Island is a nature reserve (73ha, notified in 1972), which means it is illegal to visit without permission from the N.S.W. Office of Environment and Heritage. The New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service runs very infrequent guided tours of the island, for those who are interested in its flora, fauna, geology and Aboriginal history. Some of the best views of Long Island are from Lloyd Trigonometrical station, and Tipper's Lookout, both located to the west in nearby Muogamarra Nature Reserve. From these vantage points, it is possible to look down along the length of the island and see the mouth of the Hawkesbury River and Broken Bay in the far distance. Long Island was added to the Australian National Heritage List in December 2006.Australian National Heritage listing for Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Lion Island, Long Island and Spectacle Island Nature Reserves History Long Island in the Hawkesbury River, Australia, circa 1900-1910. The first Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge is visible at the top left, and the village of Brooklyn is at the right. Photo courtesy State Library of NSW The area has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Guringai people, who left their mark on the land with hundreds of rock engravings, stone sharpening sites, cave paintings and shellfish middens. The first European to see the area was Governor Arthur Phillip, who explored the lower river by small boat in March 1788. At first the local people were friendly towards him, but when he returned a year later, they would not come into contact with him. By 1790 over half the Guringai had succumbed to the smallpox the British had brought with them. Early settlers on the island included timber getters, and by 1873 there are known to have been two houses at either end of the low central saddle. These were owned by George Woods and Albert Nelson, a lime burner and boarding house operator respectively. In the late 1890s, the island was briefly dedicated as the site for an inebriates asylum that was ultimately built on nearby Peat Island several years later. In 1911, the island was transferred to Hornsby Council for use as a recreation reserve, used mainly by fishermen. The bulk of the island that is not affected by the railway line was subsequently dedicated as a nature reserve in 1972. The Railway Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge as seen from the bridge construction site on Long Island Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge as seen from a cave on Long Island The Main North railway line from Sydney passes through a tunnel on the eastern end of the island, which is joined to Brooklyn by a railway causeway across Sandbrook Inlet, and to Cogra Point on the northern shore of the Hawkesbury River by the second Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge. The spans for this second bridge, built during the 1940s when it became necessary to replace the first bridge, were assembled on the northeastern side of Long Island, immediately to the west of the current bridge. The remains of the docks and crane mountings are still present on the hillside, and along the water's edge. Immediately to the east of the existing railway tunnel is the first railway tunnel, that was bored through the island as part of the southern approach for the first Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge. This was abandoned, along with the associated alignment on each side of the river once the replacement bridge was completed in 1946. Nomenclature Traditionally, there has been some debate about how the island was named, and whether or not its name was associated with the construction of the first Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge across its eastern extremity by the Union Bridge Company from Buffalo, New York in the mid-1880s. However, there is ample evidence to show that the name pre-dates the construction of the bridge by at least sixty years. The island was named by the surveyor W.R. Govett in 1829, due to its topography, being long and narrow at by . Furthermore, an early mention in the press from 1863 mentions an inquiry being conducted on adjacent Dangar Island for a drowned man named \\"John Foley, a woodman residing at Long Island, at the mouth of the Hawkesbury, ...\\". Finally, another reference from April 1880 reports the presence of a local surveyor, a Mr Burdett, who is: \\"... camped on Long Island, from whence he lays the surrounding country under contribution to his theodolite\\".

Uttu is an ancient Sumerian goddess associated with weaving. The same cuneiform symbol used to write her name was also used to write the Sumerian word for \\"spider\\", indicating that Uttu was probably envisioned as a spider spinning a web. She appears primarily in the myth of Enki and Ninsikila, in which she resists the sexual advances of her father Enki by ensconcing herself inside her web, but he convinces her to let him in using a gift of fresh produce and the promise that he will marry her. Enki then intoxicates her with beer and rapes her. She is rescued by Enki's wife Ninhursag, who removes Enki's semen from her vagina and plants it in the ground, resulting in the growth of eight new plants, which Enki later eats. Mythology =Enki and Ninsikila= In the version of Enki and Ninsikila from Nippur, Uttu is the daughter of Enki and Ninkurra, but, in another version, Ninkurra instead gives birth to Nin-imma, who mates with her father Enki and gives birth to Uttu as a result. Uttu matures and becomes \\"shapely and decorous\\". Enki's wife Ninhursag warns Uttu that Enki will try to seduce her, as he has done with all his other daughters. Uttu fortifies herself inside her web and, when Enki comes to seduce her, she forces him to promise that he will marry her before she will have sex with him. As marriage gifts, Uttu demands that Enki give her fruits and vegetables. Enki finds a gardener, who demands that, in exchange for the fruits and vegetables, Enki must fill his irrigation ditches with water. Enki fills the ditches and the gardener gives him the produce. Enki brings the produce to Uttu, who happily admits him into her web, but Enki gives Uttu beer to make her drunk and then rapes her. Uttu screams and Ninhursag comes to rescue her. Ninhursag removes Enki's semen from Uttu's vagina and plants it in the ground, causing eight plants to rise. Later, Enki sees the plants and is annoyed because he does not recognize them.

Located upon a flat knoll in the Tavoliere Plains, near the foot of Daunian Mountains, Lucera was the capital of Province of Capitanata and the County of Molise from 1579 until 1806.  Climate  The city is characterized by a Mediterranean climate, with long, hot summers, with extreme temperature changes during the day, and mild winters, although due to its proximity to the Daunian mountains the temperature can drop to values below . The winds are quite frequent and, although sometimes quite strong, are usually moderate. The average annual temperature is around , and rainfall amounts to an average value of . Snowfalls are rare. History =Ancient era and early Middle Ages = Lucera is located in the territory of the ancient tribe of the Daunii. Archeological excavations show the presence of a Bronze Age village inside the city boundaries. Lucera was probably named after either Lucius, a mythical Daunian king, or a temple dedicated to the goddess Lux Cereris. A third possibility is that the city was founded and named by the Etruscans, in which case the name probably means Holy Wood (luc = \\"wood\\", eri = \\"holy\\"). In 321 BC, the Roman army was deceived into thinking Lucera was under siege by the Samnites. Hurrying to relieve their allies the army walked into an ambush and were defeated at the famous Battle of the Caudine Forks. The Samnites occupied Lucera but were thrown out after a revolt. The city sought Roman protection and in 320 BC was granted the status of Colonia Togata, which meant it was ruled by the Roman Senate. In order to strengthen the ties between the two cities, 2,500 Romans moved to Lucera. From then on, Lucera was known as a steadfast supporter of Rome. During the civil wars of the late Republic, Pompey set up his headquarters in Lucera, but abandoned the city when Julius Caesar approached. Lucera quickly switched its allegiance and Caesar's clemency spared it from harm. In the next civil war between Octavian and Mark Anthony the city did not escape as lightly. After the war, Octavian settled many veteran soldiers on the lands of the ruined city. This helped Lucera recover quickly and marked an era of renewed prosperity. Many of the surviving Roman landmarks hail from this Augustan period, among them the Luceran amphitheatre. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire the city of Lucera entered into a state of decline. In 663 AD, it was captured from the Lombards and destroyed by the Eastern Roman Emperor Constans II. = Islamic period = Lucera Cathedral was converted into a mosque during the brief Muslim settlement of Lucera. In 1224, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, responding to religious uprisings in Sicily, expelled all Muslims from the island, transferring many to Lucera (Lug√™rah, as it was known in Arabic) over the next two decades. In this controlled environment, they could not challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called Lucaera Saracenorum because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. During peacetime, Muslims in Lucera were predominantly farmers. They grew durum wheat, barley, legumes, grapes and other fruits. Muslims also kept bees for honey.Taylor, p.99 The colony thrived for 75 years until it was sacked in 1300 by Christian forces under the command of Giovanni Pippino di Barletta, with the acquiescense of Charles II of Naples. The majority of the city's Muslim inhabitants were slaughtered or ‚Äì as happened to almost 10,000 of them ‚Äì sold into slavery,Julie Taylor. Muslims in Medieval Italy: The Colony at Lucera.

Maria della Vittoria.Taylor, p.187 After the Muslims were removed from Lucera, Charles tried to settle Christians in the city. Those Muslims that converted to Christianity got part of their property back, but none was restored his former position of political or economic influence. As time progressed, grain production fell in the city, and in 1339 the city was hit by a famine. Christians were allowed to farm as the Muslims.Taylor, pp. 190-194 Hohenstaufen castle. Amphitheatre of Lucera. Main sights Sights in Lucera include: *the Roman Amphitheater, dating to Augustus' times and one of the largest in southern Italy. It was discovered in 1932: during the excavations, a statue of Augustus was found in the site. It measures c. , of elliptical plan, and could host from 16,000 to 18,000 spectators. The area measures 75.2 x 43.2 m. The amphitheater could be accessed from two large portals, one towards Lucera and one towards Foggia; the two side accesses, as well as the external walls, are no more visible.

This red Italian wine is said to have gotten its name from the local dialect referring to the act of pouring a wine from cask to goblet and going back for seconds. The DOC includes 80 hectares (198 acres) of land around the commune with all grapes destined for DOC wine production needing to be harvested to a yield no greater than 14 tonnes/ha. The wine is made primarily (35-60%) from the Uva di Troia grape (known in Lucera under the synonym Sumarello), Montepulciano, Sangiovese and Malvasia nera (the latter three grapes collectively making up between 25-35% of the blend). White wine grape varieties are also permitted in this red wine with Trebbiano Toscano, Bombino bianco and Malvasia del Chianti collectively allowed to account for between 15-30% of the blend. The finished wine must attain a minimum alcohol level of 11.5% in order to be labelled with the Cacc'e mmitte di Lucera DOC designation.P.

Boy Scouts of America =History= Boy Scouting started early in Maine, with two local councils in operation by February 1915. The first second class council was in operation by 1916, and by 1917 three second class councils existed, in Auburn, Bath and Saco. South Portland Council began in 1918, as did Waterville Council, but that council apparently only existed for a year. Bangor, Old Town and Portland Councils were begun in 1919 in those localities, while in that same year Auburn, Bath and Saco's councils all ceased to exist. Old Town's council ceased to exist in 1920, while Oxford County Council (#219) was formed, with its headquarters in South Paris, Maine. In 1921, South Portland Council ceased to exist, while a new one, Biddeford & Saco Council, blossomed once again in Saco. Bangor Council opened Camp Roosevelt, believed to be the first council camp in Maine, the same year. Portland Council changed its name to Cumberland County Council in 1922, no doubt reflecting its expansion beyond the city of Portland (Portland Council had probably absorbed South Portland Council's troops upon its demise the previous year). No organizational changes appear to have occurred in 1923, but big changes would occur the next year. In 1924, the leaders of Bangor Council took a step similar to that taken by Portland Council in 1922; they changed the council's name to one more reflective of the region served‚ÄîPenobscot Council‚Äîwith the change effective at the New Year. Meanwhile, Scouting in the Saco area again took a down turn, with Biddeford & Saco Council ceasing to exist. Oxford County Council also ceased to exist in 1924. In September 1925 organizers formed a council headquartered in Rockland‚ÄîPine Tree Council. Camden was added to this council in 1928, but then Pine Tree Council was absorbed into Cumberland County Council in 1929. The latter council had been growing quite nicely already, as it had added eight towns in Oxford County in May 1929. Also added in 1929 were units in Sagadahoc, Franklin, and Kennebec Counties, as well as those in parts of Knox, Lincoln, and Somerset Counties. Five more towns in Knox County were added in 1930. Organizers in Saco tried again in 1927, forming York County Council, which also included units in Biddeford and North Berwick. Units in Somersworth, New Hampshire joined York County Council in 1929, but that town moved to New Hampshire's Daniel Webster Council in 1932. In 1929, Penobscot Council changed its name to Katahdin Area Council, possibly reflecting its growth to encompass all of the northern part of Maine. Although there are references to the council being named \\"Katahdin Council\\" on Camp Roosevelt patches, it is generally believed that \\"Area\\" has been a part of the council name since its inception. After two decades of growth and consolidation, by the BSA's twentieth anniversary in early 1930, there were just three councils in Maine‚ÄîKatahdin Area Council, headquartered in Bangor; Cumberland County Council, headquartered in Portland; and York County Council, headquartered in Saco. The 1930s would see the final changes in council organization: at the end of 1932 Cumberland County Council changed its name to Pine Tree Council; and in 1935 York County Council merged into Pine Tree Council. That merger left Maine with the two councils present there today ‚Äî Katahdin Area Council in Bangor and Pine Tree Council in Portland. =Katahdin Area Council= The Katahdin Area Council cites 1920 as its starting date, though the Bangor Council (#216) actually began operation in 1919. The Council changed its name to the Penobscot Council (#216), then in 1924 and to the Katahdin Area Council in 1929. The present day Katahdin Area Council (#216) contains , making it the largest council in land area east of the Mississippi. With nearly 3000 adults and 6000 youth, Katahdin Area Council has one of the highest adult-youth ratios in the country. The council center is located in Orono, Maine. Organization The Council is broken down into six different districts: *Hancock District *North Star District *Penquis District *Penobscot Valley District *Waldo District *Washington District Camps =Camp Roosevelt/Katahdin Scout Reservation= Camp Roosevelt or KSR (Katahdin Scout Reservation) is Katahdin Area Council's resident Scouts BSA camp and has been in operation since 1921. The camp is in Eddington, Maine and has over of pristine forest at the base of Black Cap Mountain that surround the Fitts Pond. The camp has 19 camp sites and can handle about 500 campers at one time. One of the hallmarks of the camp is the log cabin style Dining lodge - Pamola Lodge which was built in 1929. It remains as one of the largest free standing log cabins in the country. In 2001, the camp added a COPE program, (Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience) which provides both high and low element activities and challenges for scouts over 14 years old. In August 2006 the Peter Vigue Scout Center was completed, it includes the Teddy Roosevelt Welcome Room and a Lodge/dining hall that seats 420 people. The prior lodge/dining hall was renamed the Pamola Lodge in 2009 and is now used for program activities with an eye towards insulating to improve opportunities for packs, troops, and crews throughout the winter. =Maine High Adventure BSA= Maine High Adventure BSA, formerly Maine National High Adventure Area, is operated by the Katahdin Area Council and serves as a high adventure program for Scouts from throughout the country. Hundreds of Scouts and Ventures, enjoy a unique backcountry experience in northern Maine. The area encompasses nearly , including Mt. Katahdin, the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, the Penobscot watershed, the St.Croix International Waterway, the northernmost of the Appalachian Trail, and many other streams and lakes. Much of the almost open for exploration remain untouched - as travelers like Henry David Thoreau experienced it over 150 years ago. Since 1970, Maine High Adventure has been providing customized, fully outfitted, guided trips for youth groups of all kinds. Participants have come from across the country and the world to experience the type of backcountry adventure that is becoming more and more scarce each day. Maine High Adventure provides food, camping equipment, van transportation, and a fully trained \\"Matagamon guide\\". Order of the Arrow Pamola Lodge 211 is the Order of the Arrow lodge for Katahdin Area Council, serving northern and eastern Maine, and is part of the Northeast Region, Section NE-1. Pamola Lodge encompasses the largest geographical area of any lodge east of the Mississippi and is the most northern lodge in the continental United States. The Lodge was first chartered in 1941, although much of its early history is shrouded in mystery. In 1951 the lodge disbanded only to be rechartered again in 1955. Lodge activity continued to grow in the late 1950s and 1960s with the Lodge's first Vigil ceremony being held in 1961. The Totem of the Lodge is the Running Moose, which is shown on the flap. The Lodge is named after the legendary Penobscot Indian Spirit of Mount Katahdin, Pamola. Pamola Lodge was one of the few lodges to have retained its original flap for its entire history until 2007 when the flap was reinvented. In 2006, Pamola Lodge received the National Service Award which was established to recognize lodges in each region that have performed outstanding service, both in qualitative and a quantitave sense, to their council. In 2015, Pamola Lodge received the Section NE-1 Ordeal ceremonies award. =Pine Tree Council= The present-day Pine Tree Council (#218) can trace its beginnings to 1919, when organizers formed Portland Council (#218) in that city. South Portland Council was formed a year earlier but that council folded in 1921. In 1922 Portland Council became Cumberland County Council (#218), no doubt reflecting its growth outside of the city of Portland. Between 1922 and 1932 Cumberland County Council continued to grow, adding units in Oxford, Sagadahoc, Androscoggin, Franklin, Kennebec, Knox Lincoln,and Somerset counties. The original Pine Tree Council (#710), formed in Rockland in 1925, merged into Cumberland County Council in 1929, and in 1933 Cumberland County Council became the Pine Tree Council we know today. York County Council (#217) merged into Pine Tree Council in 1935. Background Scouts from Maine have been active throughout the years and had high involvement from the community. In 1953 39 Scouts traveled to the National Scout Jamboree led by Stanley McCurdy, Millard Neal and Clyde Nason. They were known as special Troop 27. Districts The council contains four districts: *Abnaki District *Casco Bay District *Kennebec Valley District *York District Camps =Camp Bomazeen= Camp Bomazeen is located on Great Pond in North Belgrade, Maine, where on its shores, Screenwriter Ernest Thompson spent his summers as a youth. Thus Great Pond was the inspiration for the screen play \\"On Golden Pond\\". Camp Bomazeen was opened in 1946. For 57 years, the camp provided a long term Boy Scout summer camp experience adding specialty weeks in later years (Be First Class, wilderness survival, mountain man, Indian lore, drama, photography, bike treks, back packing, environmental science, and art among others) along with Webelos camp programs. Summer Camp operations ceased after the 2003 summer season. Today, Bomazeen with campsites and cabins with wood stoves provides year-round opportunities to packs, troops, crews, and ships; a tremendous site for district camporees; and the venue for Trailblazer days for new Cubs and Parents just joining Scouting. Wood Badge training courses and Order of the Arrow ordeals are regularly held there. Pine Tree Council is currently in a fundraising campaign to develop and improve its year-round facilities. Kennebec Valley District uses camp Bomazeen for summer Cub day camp. Boy Scout resident summer camp is scheduled to return to the camp in the summer of 2014. In the summer of 2004, Pine Tree Council stopped using Camp Bomazeen as a Summer Camp. For the next 10 years Camp Bomazeen was used as a day camp for Cub Scouts only. In 2014 Pine Tree Council re-opened the Camp to Boy Scouts launching a brand new program using specialty themes. These themes were Maine Junior Woodsman Guide, Nechemis (new scout program), Trades and Technology, and Bush Craft Adventure. Camp Bomazeen is named for Chief Bomazeen (whose name translates 'keeper of the ceremonial flames') of the Norridgewock tribe of the Wabenaki nation. The Camp Bomazeen property was donated in 1944 by Dr. George G. & Francis M. Averill of Waterville. =Camp Gustin= Located on Loon Pond, Sabattus, Maine, Camporees have been held on this council property since at least 1947. The camp has been a regular site for Abnaki district (surrounding Auburn, Lisbon, Lewiston, Norway, Pris, and Bethel in Androsscoggin and Oxford Counties) events including camporees, Cub events, and district Cub Day Camps. Although a favorite of Abnaki, many units from other parts of the Council have camped there, taken part in \\"Beaver\\" work days, and done service projects to improve campsites. With open fields and wooded campsites for tenting, a clean water source and latrines, a pond, a pavilion, and back country roads in the area, Camp Gustin hosts troop shakedowns and junior leader training, design-your-own second class rural hiking, troop challenges, Cub family camping, picnics, and field days, and for older Scout retreats. The camp had been under consideration for sale in order to support other properties and/or relieve council debt, but in November 2010, Pine Tree Council announced its intention to keep the camp as a site for unit outdoor programs for Boy Scouts of all ages. =Camp William Hinds= Camp William Hinds opened in 1927 as the summer camp for Cumberland County Council. The camp was named for the son of the businessman who donated the property to the council. The camp is located on of land on Panther Pond in Raymond, Maine and is currently the only long term Pine Tree Council camp supporting troops and packs in southern Maine. Scouts use Camp Hinds for a full week-long summer program of aquatics, nature/ecology, Scoutcraft (outdoor skills), archery and riflery, handicraft, ropes course, and climbing. The Ring Dining Hall is a place for family style dining and mealtime programs. The summer camp also has campfire programs. Week-long winter programs during Maine school vacations and winter camping programs based in the Rotary Training Center are popular. Troops and packs use the facilities not just at summer camp but for unit based programs in spring, fall, and winter. The camp has 14 large, wooded campsites along with three cabins available though Pine Tree Council throughout the year. Summer camp programs include 7 Scouts BSA weeks and 2 4-day 3-night Webelos camping sessions. Summer Fun Pack Weekends are designed for Cub Scout Packs and their families. The camp has been extensively used throughout the years. In 1954, the camp hosted an adult leader training for 2,00 volunteers in the area. The Trading Post once sold many Neal Manufacturing Company slides, manufactured by C. Millard Neal, a volunteer in the Pine Tree Council. The Scout Museum at the Pine Tree Council offices has a display on these nationally popular plastic slides. The slides featured every imaginable Scout image. Some came pre-painted but most scouts bought the plain ones and painted them themselves. =Camp Nutter= Camp William Nutter, located on Loon Pond in Acton, Maine, was originally the summer camp for York County Council. When that council merged into Pine Tree Council in 1935, it was initially not used as a summer camp; however, sometime after 1944 the council opened it as a summer camp. It operated as such into the 1950s. The earliest dated patch is 1949. The council still owns the property, but it is only used by the York District for weekend events & Cub Scout Day Camp. Order of the Arrow Madockawanda Lodge 271 is the Order of the Arrow Lodge for the Pine Tree Council, serving scouts in central and southern Maine. It is a part of the Section NE-1 of the Northeast Region. Madockawanda Lodge has continuously operated since its founding in 1944 at Camp Hinds. Madockawanda Lodge was founded by Frank W.P. Bailey, a long time staff member of Camp Hinds. Mr. Bailey gave the name Madockawanda, after the story of the great Indian Chief Madockawanda who unified the Penobscot Nation. The Lodge totem is the snapping turtle. In the early years, chapters of the Lodge were located at the Council's summer camp facilities (Hinds, Bomazeen). Camp Nutter was the summer camp of the former York County Council. They had adopted a different honor society, the \\"Nikiwigi\\", and a period of negotiation was required before Camp Nutter OA chapter replaced the Nikiwigi tribe there. The chapter was active for only a few years before summer camp operations ceased at Nutter, and the chapter disbanded. As the elections moved from summer camp to units, camp based chapters co-existed with chapters divided along the lines of the Council's districts. Each camp chapter had a Lodge Vice Chief that supervised the districts closest to his camp. The Lodge inducted its first Vigil Honor member (& the first Vigil Honor member in any Maine Council) in 1952 when founder Frank W.P. Bailey was inducted and given the name Sirus. The Lodge continued the tradition of star and constellation based Vigil names until 1971. Four members of Madockawanda have received the National Distinguished Service Award, numerous youth and adults have served as Section officers and advisers. In 2000, Madockawanda Lodge was one of eight Lodges to receive the first National Service Award. It also earned the award in 2006, 2008 and 2009. It holds the record for the most National Service Awards awarded to a single lodge in the Northeast Region. Madockawanda has received quality lodge recognition 14 years since 1991. Girl Scouts of the USA =Girl Scouts of Maine= The sole Maine Girl Scout council, Girl Scouts of Maine, formed in October 2007 by the merger of Abnaki Girl Scout Council and Girl Scouts of Kennebec Council. It serves over 14,000 girls and has about 4,000 adult volunteers and is headquartered in South Portland, Maine. History The first known active troop in Maine was in 1917 in Augusta. Abnaki Girl Scout Council was established in the northern part of Maine in 1962 from Bangor- Brewer, Central Penobscot, Presque Isle and Houlton councils and many lone troops. Girl Scouts of Kennebec Council was established in 1963 from 11 southern Maine councils and again many lone troops.

It was situated in Colindale, seven miles (11.3 km) north west of Charing Cross. It nearly became \\"the Charing Cross of the UK's international air routes\\", but for the actions of the RAF after the First World War. It was known as a place of pioneering experiments including the first airmail, the first parachute descent from a powered aircraft, the first night flights, and the first aerial defence of a city. Beginnings Henry Coxwell and James Glaisher were the first to fly from Hendon in a balloon called the Mammoth in 1862; and ballooning at the Brent Reservoir was a very popular spectacle for the crowds gathered on bank holidays late in the 19th century. The first powered flight from Hendon was in an long non-rigid airship built by Spencer Brothers of Highbury. It took off from the Welsh Harp Reservoir in 1909, piloted by Henry Spencer, and the only passenger was Muriel Matters, the Australian suffragette. The first attempt at heavier-than-air flight was by H.P. Martin and G.H. Handasyde, again at the Welsh Harp. They constructed a monoplane with four engines in the ballroom of the hotel, but were never able to get airborne. Inspired by Louis Bl√©riot‚Äôs flight across the Channel, Everett, Edgecumbe and Co began to experiment with an aircraft to be built at their works at Colindale near Hendon, erecting a small hangar to house it. From 1908 to 1910, their \\"Grasshopper\\", as the plane was called, taxied about and left the ground briefly, but failed to get truly airborne, although these attempts attracted quite a crowd. In 1906, before any powered flight had taken place in Britain, the Daily Mail newspaper had challenged aviators to fly from London to Manchester or vice versa, offering a prize of ¬£10,000. The journey had to be completed within twenty-four hours, with no more than two landings. Aircraft and engine design had improved sufficiently by 1910 to make an attempt to win the prize realistic, and both Claude Grahame-White and the French aviator Louis Paulhan prepared for the challenge during April 1910. Grahame-White made two attempts, but it was Paulhan who succeeded. He chose a field on the future aerodrome site as his point of departure. On 27 April he flew from Hendon to Lichfield, easily the longest flight accomplished in the UK at that time. Before dawn on 28 April he took off and reached Burnage on the outskirts of Manchester after three hours 55 minutes in the air, during a period of just over twelve hours. This was the first true flight from the Hendon site. London Aerodrome George Beatty (far right) and colleague with six student pilots destined for the Royal Flying Corps, photographed at Hendon in August 1916. Flight Magazine, 2 July 1925 Grahame-White created a new company, the Grahame-White Aviation Company, taking control of more than of Colindale and converting it into what could be recognised as a proper modern airfield. The first occupants were Horatio Barber's Aeronautical Syndicate Ltd and the Bleriot flying school.Opening of the Bleriot School Flight magazine 8 October 1910 p. 818 From 9 to 16 September 1911, the first official UK airmail was flown between Hendon and Windsor as part of the celebrations of the coronation of King George V. In 1912, the first Aerial Derby started and ended at Hendon. An estimated three million people turned out across London, forming a human ring around the race circuit to see the aviators fly round the metropolis. An estimated two million of these Londoners had never seen an aircraft in flight before.The Aerial DerbyFlight magazine 15 June 1912 p530 At Hendon Aerodrome at least 45,000 people paid for admission to the enclosures. These annual events became as important as the Ascot and Epsom races during the London Season. By 1925, 100,000 people were coming to see the display, and it was so popular that there was talk of having to spread it over a few days. The first fatality at Hendon, reported in The Times in May 1911, was Bernard Benson (aged 23). On 25 May 1911 he fell from an ASL Valkyrie. A number of flying schools were located at Hendon, including Grahame-White's, and another established in 1914 by the American aviator George Beatty, in partnership with Handley Page Ltd. These continued normal operation until late 1916.Igoe, Kate. George W. Beatty Collection, National Air and Space Museum, 1997. Retrieved 11 June 2012. On 11 September 1916, Cicely Ethel Wilkinson qualified as a pilot in a Caudron biplane at the Beatty School at the aerodrome for which she received Royal Aero Club Aviator Certificate number 3522. She was possibly the only woman to qualify as a pilot in Britain during the First World War. In November 1916, the War Office commandeered the flying schools, after which the aerodrome trained 490 pilots. Claude Grahame-White and other members of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) mounted a night defence of London in 1915, constituting the very first aerial defence of London. After World War I, the first RAF \\"Pageant\\" was held at Hendon in 1920https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/about-us/our-history/Hendon-cradle-of- aviation.aspx, and it soon became a regular event, known from 1925 as the Royal Air Force Display, and in 1938 as the Empire Air Day. The Aerodrome was briefly active during the Battle of Britain, but for most of World War II, the Aerodrome was mainly used for transport activities, and flying dignitaries to and from London. RAF Hendon had three crossed runways with magnetic headings of: QDM 339 - 3975 x 150 feet QDM 280 - 3000 x 150 feet QDM 014 - 3060 x 150 feet These runways were removed by 1969. Manufacturing at Hendon Production of aeroplanes was one of the features of the aerodrome's activities under Grahame-White. During the First World War production increased rapidly. To facilitate the transportation of the 3,500 workers and materials, the Midland Railway built a spur from the embanked main line with a platform close to the main line and a loop around the airfield to the plant. It had been Claude Grahame-White's conviction that Hendon would become \\"the Charing Cross of our international air routes\\", but the Air Ministry took over in 1922, which led to a protracted and ugly legal action lasting until 1925, when Grahame-White left the site. The end of aviation at Hendon The use of Hendon as an airfield was under threat even before the war, since it was considered that RAF Hendon would become a target for enemy bombing raids. After the war the airfield was increasingly unsuitable, particularly because the runways were too short, and the proximity of residential areas made matters worse. The RAF argued the military importance of the complex into the 1950s in case future developments in aviation technology might render the base suitable again, but eventually Hendon Borough Council and the London County Council were able to argue that houses were needed more than the aerodrome. The last flying unit, the Metropolitan Communication Squadron, left Hendon in November 1957. The entrance to the aerodrome can be seen in \\"the parade\\" scene in the 1967 film The Dirty Dozen, with at one point a Kirby Cadet glider of the then-resident 617 Volunteer Gliding School of the Air Training Corps launching in the background. Late in 1968, when two of the three runways had been removed, a Blackburn Beverley was flown in to be an exhibit at the new RAF Museum: this was the last aircraft to land in Hendon. The RAF station finally closed in 1987. The site of the aerodrome is now occupied by the Grahame Park housing estate, Hendon Police College and the RAF Museum which is situated on the southeast side of the site. Hendon today The 2008 Hendon Pageant Today, Hendon houses the London branch of the Royal Air Force Museum which portrays the role of the Royal Air Force in the development of aviation and avionics in the United Kingdom. The museum consists of several buildings containing a range of permanent exhibitions including \\"Our Finest Hour\\" in the Battle Of Britain Hall which was designed, produced and installed by specialist theme park and museum designers Sarner Ltd, the award-winning \\"Milestones of Flight\\" which details the major developments in flight technology from 1903 to 2003, two buildings containing various aircraft and helicopters, and part of the Grahame-White Factory, which contains many examples of original aircraft from World War One and the early days of aviation. Admission to the museum is free; there is however a car parking fee. The museum runs a programme of free events throughout the year suitable for children and young adults as well as a 3D cinema, located in \\"Milestones of Flight\\", plus exploration Gallery \\"Aeronauts Interactive\\".

They were originally named, The Shits, but decided on Happyland. Their only album, Welcome to Happyland, was released on 25 August 1998, via the Polydor Australia label, which reached No. 18 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It provided the single, \\"Don't You Know Who I Am?\\" (July 1998), which peaked at No. 24 on the ARIA Singles Chart.  History  In 1996 Janet English of Spiderbait started dating Quan Yeomans of Regurgitator. During downtime from their respective main projects, in 1997 in Brisbane, the pair formed the Shits (later renamed as Happyland) as an art pop side project. As the Shits, English and Yeomans, provided the artwork for Regurgitor's album, Unit (November 1997); at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 the duo won the Best Cover Art category. Happyland's only album, Welcome to Happyland, was released on 25 August 1998 via Polydor Australia, which peaked at No. 18 on the ARIA Albums Chart.Peak chart positions for charting releases in Australia: * \\"Don't You Know Who I Am?\\": * Welcome to Happyland: * \\"Hello!\\": It was recorded Yeomans' home studio and produced by the duo, with all tracks co-written by English and Yeomans. AllMusic's Jody Macgregor opined that \\"The songs they recorded together combined the most hyper-kinetic and poppy sounds common to the two bands, with English's vocals at their most high-pitched and girlish, and Yeomans' melodies at their most twitchy and infectious.\\" Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it \\"boasted noisy modern fuzz-pop.\\" At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 English and Yeomans were nominated for Best Cover Art for Welcome to Happyland. \\"Don't You Know Who I Am?\\", the lead single from the album, peaked at No. 24 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was listed at No. 28 in Triple J's 1998 Hottest 100 music poll; while the follow up single, \\"Hello!\\" (November 1998), was listed at No. 71. \\"Hello!\\", which did not peak in the ARIA Singles Chart top 50, was proposed for Regurgitator's Unit but it did not fit with the rest of its content. McFarlane described \\"Hello\\" as \\"low- tech but snappy pop.\\" Happyland toured Australia as part of the 1999 Big Day Out music festival, in late January and early February, performing at the Gold Coast, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. In their live shows, the band members dressed in fluffy animal costumes. They provided a cover version the Italian song, \\"Tintarella di luna\\" (written by Bruno de Filippi and Franco Migliacci), on the soundtrack for the feature film, Looking for Alibrandi, in 2000. The duo had disbanded in 1999 and each member had returned to their respective main project. Quan mentioned in a 2001 interview in the Daily Telegraph that Happyland were working on another release. This is backed up by a comment made by Quan, when asked \\"Will there be any more Happyland releases?\\", on a web chat for Rolling Stone Australia, in October 2000, he answered, \\"We may have a song or three for the willing and able out there.\\" However, both have stated that this is unlikely, as they have since split up as a domestic couple, but remain good friends. English replied, in August 2004, to the notion of a reunion, \\"A Happyland comeback? (laughs) [It] was just the one off thing, just a bit of fun when we had time off from our respective bands.

Gumpert filed for bankruptcy in August 2013, thereby ending the production of the Apollo. History The two Gumpert Apollo Prototypes with an F-4 Phantom II Pre- production car In 2000, Roland Gumpert proposed a new generation of sports cars. One of the primary criteria for this car was that it be street-legal yet ready for the racetrack. He returned to Germany at the end of 2001, after over three years in China where he was the head of sales and marketing responsible for the development of the dealer network of the Audi-VW joint enterprise there. Subsequently, automobile designer Roland Mayer asked him if he would assist in building a prototype sports car. Audi approved Gumpert's involvement in this project, on the condition that, if they did eventually develop a new sports car, it would not be a prototype, but a series product. The company, located in Altenburg, Germany was founded in 2004 under the name GMG Sportwagenmanufaktur Altenburg GmbH. The technical guidelines were defined and the first designs of the car were drawn by Marco Vanetta. Upon Vanetta's completion of this process, the first 1:4 scale model of Gumpert's car was produced in 2001. Gumpert continued with the development of the Apollo, along with the Technical University of Munich and the Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences. They assisted him with the constructional work, computer simulations, and wind tunnel tests. This research and development helped forming the blueprint for the first 1:1 scale model. Finally, two prototype cars were constructed. Production of the Apollo started in October 2005. Soon after the first fully functioning road car made its way to Europe, the car became fully road-legal and was sold in various Gumpert dealerships. Very soon after, car reviewers praised the car's speed and cornering. During a review in Autocar magazine, chief test driver Matt Prior stated that \\"the Apollo recalibrates the meaning of pure speed and driving feel\\". On Series 11 of Top Gear, the Apollo lapped the Top Gear test track in a time of 1:17.1, setting a record that lasted for 2 years until surpassed by the Ferrari FXX. Motorsport HHF Hybrid race car During April 2005, the Apollo made its racing debut in the Divinol Cup. It was driven by Belgian race car driver Ruben Maes; he finished third on the Hockenheimring race track. Three years later Gumpert announced that they would enter a hybrid version of the Apollo in the 2008 24 Hours N√ºrburgring, driven by 2004 winner Dirk M√ºller and ex- Formula One racer Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Three months passed between the first discussions and the finished hybrid Apollo. The Apollo was driven in the 24 Hours N√ºrburgring in May 2008. The hybrid Apollo can deliver up to , powered with a 3.3 litre V8 twin-turbocharged engine coupled with a electric motor. The car has the ability to recharge the battery under braking. Design Rear view The Apollo can weigh between and (depending on options), and is fully street-legal. It is a mid-engine, rear wheel drive two-seater constructed on a tubular chromoly frame, with fiberglass or optional carbon fibre body panels. Gumpert claims the design of the Apollo is optimised so that the car could drive upside-down in a tunnel if driven at sufficiently high speeds [over ], Gumpert Homepage but this has not been tested. The Apollo set a 7:11.57 lap time at N√ºrburgring achieved by german car magazine sport auto.

In each US state, such boards may govern either the state university system, individual colleges and universities, or both. In general, they operate as a board of directors, and they vary by formal name, size, powers, and membership. In some states, members are appointed by the governor. From a legal standpoint, many higher education institutions are corporations; they have separate legal personhood. The corporation is the legal owner of its endowment and other property. The corporation's name might consist of its governing board members' title (for example, The Trustees of Princeton University is a New Jersey nonprofit corporation). These board members (trustees, regents, etc.) are fiduciaries for the corporation. In some cases, the institution might not have separate legal personhood; the trustees transact in their own name with other parties, such as students, faculty or donors. However, the trustees often utilize a common, enduring title, which enables the trust to operate continuously even as individual trustees change. In some private institutions of higher learning, non-governing boards may also be appointed. These boards' members' duties often include but are not limited to major gift cultivation and fundraising. Membership Governing boards of universities are of varying sizes across the United States. Smaller boards may have about ten members, while larger boards can have over 50 members. In 2016, the average public university board had 12 members, while the average private university board had 29 members. Some university governing boards are composed entirely of alumni of that university. Other boards contain various elected officials, often the state governor, as ex officio members. Members of the governing board can be selected in a variety of ways. Members of public university boards are most often selected by the state governor. Four states (Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, and Nevada) elect members of some university boards by popular vote. Boards of private universities can be selected either by an alumni vote or by the existing members of the board. Board names =Trustees= The term \\"Board of Trustees\\" is the most commonly used name for governing bodies of universities in the United States. All schools within the Ohio Higher Education System are governed by individual Boards of Trustees, including Miami University and Ohio State University. The governing body at Duke University is known as the board of trustees, while each college and the graduate school maintains its own board of visitors. The University of Floridahttps://trustees.ufl.edu/, University of South Carolina Michigan State University, Indiana University, and the University of Connecticut are also governed by boards of trustees. =Regents= Thirty-nine states have boards of regents to govern their public university systems. The Regents of the University of California govern the University of California system, with one exception: the original endowment that allowed for the creation of UC's Hastings College of the Law stipulated that it could not be governed by the Regents. However, Hastings Law degrees are issued in the name of the UC Regents. The Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York oversees all public education, including the State University of New York (SUNY), affiliated community colleges, and the K‚Äì12 public school system (run by the New York State Education Department) via the Regents Examinations. High school graduates may receive Regents Scholarships to defray expenses at SUNY universities. The boards of the University of Hawaii, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Texas, Texas Tech University, University of Wisconsin System, Texas A&M;, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Colorado, University of New Mexico, University of Houston System, University of North Texas, St. Olaf College, University of Washington and Washington State University are known as the board of regents. =Governors= The governing bodies of the University of North Carolina and the Colorado State University system are known as their 'board of governors'. Public institutions in Rhode Island are also governed by a board of governors. There are five public institutions in Missouri that are not part of the UM System, among them the Missouri State University, are overseen by boards of governors. The two largest universities in West Virginia: West Virginia University and Marshall University also maintain boards of governors. =Overseers= The Harvard Board of Overseers (more formally The Honorable and Reverend Board of Overseers) is one of Harvard University's two governing boards, with the other being the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation). =Fellows= The Fellows of the University of Notre Dame are a self-perpetuating body that retains the core powers of the University and selects the members of the other governing board, the Board of Trustees. =Visitors= The following institutions have boards known as a \\"board of visitors\\". These include the United States Military Academy, United States Air Force Academy, United States Naval Academy, The Citadel, The Military College of SC, and the major universities in the Commonwealth of Virginia such as the University of Virginia (Charlottesville), University of Mary Washington (Fredericksburg), George Mason University (Fairfax), Virginia State University (Petersburg), Virginia Commonwealth University (Richmond), Longwood University (Farmville), Washington and Lee University (Lexington), the College of William and Mary (Williamsburg), Old Dominion University (Norfolk), Christopher Newport University (Newport News), and Virginia Tech (Blacksburg). By state =Alabama= The Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama governs the three universities that are part of the University of Alabama System. Auburn University is governed by the Auburn University Board of Trustees. = Alaska = The Board of Regents has 11 members and governs the institutions in the University of Alaska System. =District of Columbia= The governing board of Georgetown University is known as the President and Directors of Georgetown College. =Georgia= The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia is the oversight authority for thirty universities and colleges in the state of Georgia (including the University of Georgia and Georgia Institute of Technology) along with the state archives and the state public library system. =Louisiana= In the State of Louisiana, the governing board of each of the four public university systems is known as the Board of Supervisors. =Missouri= The governing board of the University of Missouri System and each individual campus in that system is known as the Board of Curators.\\"http://www.umsystem.edu/curators/\\" This terminology is also used by another Missouri public institution, Lincoln University. However, the state's other public institutions use different terms. Five use Board of Governors (see below), and three use Board of Regents. =North Carolina= Institutions in North Carolina use several different names for their boards. The University of North Carolina‚Äîwhich includes all 16 four-year public institutions in the state, plus a residential high school‚Äîis overseen by a board of governors. Some individual campuses within the system, such as East Carolina University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have boards of visitors. =Virginia= Boards governing public institutions of higher education in the state of Virginia are known as the board of visitors. This includes The College of William & Mary, University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, James Madison University, Radford University, University of Mary Washington, Longwood University, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Commonwealth University, and George Mason University.Board of Visitors Christopher Newport University Terminology for private institutions can vary. Regent University once used \\"board of visitors\\", but now uses \\"board of trustees\\". Washington and Lee University also uses \\"board of trustees\\".

They were known to reach speeds of up to 85 mph (137 km/h). Overview No 1042 (Deeley-built) with express Bradford to London, sometime between 1908‚Äì1910 These were developed from a series of five locomotives (2631‚Äì2635) introduced in 1902 by Samuel Waite Johnson, which had a 3-cylinder compound arrangement on the Smith system, with one high-pressure cylinder inside the frames and two low-pressure cylinders outside, and used Smith's starting arrangement. On the first two locomotives independent control of high-pressure and low-pressure valve gears was available. From 1905 onwards, Johnson's successor Richard Deeley built an enlarged and simplified version, eliminating all the Smith refinements and fitting his own starting arrangement, making the engines simpler to drive. These locomotives were originally numbered 1000‚Äì1029, but in the 1907 renumbering scheme the five Smith/Johnson locomotives became 1000‚Äì1004 and the Deeley compounds 1005‚Äì1034. Ten more of these were added in 1908‚Äì1909. The original Johnson locomotives were all subsequently renewed as Deeley compounds, including the now-preserved 1000 which was rebuilt and outshopped with a superheater in 1914. Numbered 1000‚Äì1044 by both the Midland and LMS companies, British Railways renumbered the Midland series of compounds 41000‚Äì41044 after nationalisation in 1948.

Francesco Scarlatti: Dixit Dominus (p 2-3) [CD booklet. Reading: Deux-Elles Classical Recordings.] Francesco was ever to live under the shadow of his better known relatives, Alessandro Scarlatti (his elder brother) and his nephew, Domenico. However, Francesco himself was an accomplished musician and held a number of appointments. He was born on 5 December 1666 at Palermo, Sicily. Due to the island being under the control of the Kingdom of Naples, Francesco went up to study at the well-known Conservatorio in the city. His first appointment, following his studies, was as a violinist at the Chapel Royal in Naples. His appointment was controversial: a number of Neapolitan musicians resented the young provincial's influence at court. In 1690, he married Rosalinda Albano. She died in 1706 after giving Scarlatti five children. Francesco later travelled around Europe. He visited London in 1719; some sources suggest that this was on the invitation of his friend Handel, whom he had met some years before in Italy. Hardly anything is known of his time in London. It is thought that he probably worked in theatre orchestras. Scarlatti was recommended to James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos by John Arbuthnot. Chandos, a patron of Handel, maintained a musical establishment at his main house, Cannons in Middlesex, but Scarlatti appears not to have joined it.[\\"Handel: tercentenary collection\\", Stanley Sadie, Anthony Hicks] By 1724 Francesco Scarlatti was living in Dublin. His post was reported as 'Master of Musick'. Perhaps whilst in Ireland he remarried. The Dublin Journal of 1733 reports: 'Jane Scarlatti, wife of Francis Scarlatti, Master of Musick, hath eloped from her said husband. This is to desire that nobody may give any credit to the said Jane Scarlatti on account of her said husband; for he will not pay any debts that she shall contract; nor answer any bills she may draw on him.' The last record of Francesco Scarlatti is in 1741, when he was apparently unavailable for a concert due to ill-health. No further record remains of Scarlatti.

They brew one of the strongest beers in Belgium, the Bush Ambr√©e at 12% ABV.http://www.br-dubuisson.com Brewery website History Founded in 1769 by farmer Joseph Leroy, the brewery only sold its beer to the workers in the farm and to the inhabitants of the town of Pipaix where the brewery was installed. In 1931, the brothers Alfred and Am√©d√©e Dubuisson, descendants of Joseph Leroy, decided to abandon the farm and to concentrate on the production of beer. The beers were meant to be a mix of English and Belgian beers (due to the growing success of English beers at the time), so the name of the beer was English and the production method used both English and Belgian techniques. The current brewery is still located at the same place and still owned by the Dubuisson family. Beers Dubuisson produce 4 different top fermented, filtered beers, all of which carry the brand name \\"Bush\\", which comes from a translation of the family name du Buisson. * Bush 7% (7.5% ABV), green label, also known as Scaldis or Clovis for export, was first brewed in 1994 to celebrate the 225th anniversary of the brewery. It is made of aromatic Czech hops, coriander and caramel malt. * Bush blonde (10.5% ABV), yellow label, was first brewed in 1998 at the 65th anniversary of the Bush ambr√©e. * Bush de No√´l (12% ABV), blue label, is brewed in small quantities and is to be drunk at the end of each year. It is brewed using the technique of houblonnage √† cru (dry hopping), and also contains caramel malt in large quantities, which gives the beer a red-amber colour. It was introduced in 1991. * Bush Ambr√©e (12% ABV), orange label, first brewed by Alfred Dubuisson, grandfather of the current master brewer Hughes Dubuisson, in 1933. It was formerly known as Bush 12%. It was renamed after its amber colour due to the usage of caramel malt. All are available in 25cl bottles, and 33cl bottles for exportation, while the Bush de No√´l is also sold in magnum (1.5l). The Bush 7% and Bush de No√´l are also available in 20l and 30l barrels.

Transfer factors were originally described as immune molecules that are derived from blood or spleen cells that cause antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity, primarily delayed hypersensitivity and the production of lymphokines, as well as binding to the antigens themselves. They have a molecular weight of approximately 5000 Daltons and are composed entirely of amino acids. Transfer factors were discovered by Henry Sherwood Lawrence in 1954. A second use of the term transfer factor applies to a likely different entity derived from cow colostrum or chicken egg yolk which is marketed as an oral dietary supplement under the same name citing claims of benefit to the immune system.PDR History In 1942, Merrill Chase discovered that cells taken from the peritoneum of Guinea pigs that had been immunized against an antigen could transfer immunity when injected into Guinea pigs that had never been exposed to the antigen; this phenomenon was the discovery of cell-mediated immunity. Subsequent research attempted to uncover how the cells imparted their effects. Henry Sherwood Lawrence, in 1955, discovered that partial immunity could be transferred even when the immune cells had undergone lysis - indicating that cells did not need to be fully intact in order to produce immune effects. Lawrence went on to discover that only the factors less than 8000 Daltons were required to transfer this immunity; he termed these to be \\"transfer factors\\". The history of cellular derived transfer factor as a treatment effectively ended in the early 1980s. While the research world was initially excited by the discovery of Dr. Lawrence and the possibility that a small molecule could effect the immune system, the concept of small molecules having such profound biologic effect had not been proven. Despite several successes in using transfer factor to treat human disease and uncover immune effects, one then- prominent researcher was exposed for falsifying data related to his work on transfer factor and guinea pigs; effectively casting all of transfer factor science in a negative light. This scandal was followed shortly thereafter by the discovery of the Interleukin-1 alpha molecule and thus attention further shifted towards research on interleukins. By 1973, it was discovered that blood products could harbor viruses such as hepatitis A, indicating that transfer factor treatments derived from human or cow blood cells had the potential to transmit these diseases. With the eventual discovery of HIV/AIDS as an additional blood-borne disease most researchers viewed a product derived from blood as an unsafe treatment since screening for hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS would not be developed until after 1985. Some studies using transfer factor have been conducted after the discovery of HIV/AIDS, but almost all have been outside of the United States. Most recently, transfer factor has been harvested from sources other than blood, and administered orally, as opposed to intravenously. This use of transfer factors from sources other than blood has not been accompanied by the same concerns associated with blood-borne diseases, since no blood is involved. Transfer factor based nutritional supplements have become extremely popular throughout the world. However the way transfer factor works is still not clear. Scientific claims To communicate between cells, the immune system employs hormone-like signal substances; transfer factors are one class of such immune system communication substances. Transfer factors include both inducer/helper functions (Inducer Factors) and regulator functions (Regulator Factors)‚Äîhistorically called \\"suppressor functions\\". The Inducer Factors translate an apparently mature immune response from the donor to the recipient. Regulator Factors help control overreactions and limit allergies and autoimmune conditions. Transfer factors have been shown to induce an immune response in less than 24 hours. Transfer factors are not species-specific, thus transfer factors produced by a cow's immune system are just as effective in humans as they are in the cow. Henry Sherwood Lawrence discovered that blood cells could 'transfer' antigen- specific cell-mediated immunity even after the cells had undergone lysis. This lymphocyte product is sometimes referred to as \\"dialyzable leukocyte extract\\" in the scientific literature due to being an extract from white blood cells undergoing dialysis to remove all molecules larger than ~5000 Daltons. Studies on cellular transfer factor have involved mostly animal models and small human clinical trials. These studies have demonstrated preliminary evidence of immune modulation as well as some clinical benefits in a handful of diseases, but the studies not been assessed beyond primary sources and the trials should only be considered pre-clinical. The exact identity (protein primary structure) of the transfer factor is unknown. HPLC studies suggest that a common part in them is the fragment \`LLYAQD[LV]EDN\`, a sequence not found in any mammalian genomes. Uses Despite a small modicum of successes, transfer factor generated from human blood (human-derived), cow spleen (bovine- derived), or mouse spleen (murine derived) is not in routine clinical use today. A trial investigating its ability to immunize children with leukemia against shingles showed promise in a small number of patients, but represents only one of two placebo-controlled studies. Instead, transfer factors derived from cow colostrum and/or chicken eggs yolks are used predominantly today. Side effects = Colostrum-derived transfer factors = Long-term oral administration of colostrum-derived transfer factors has been shown to be safe. = Blood-derived transfer factors = Human-derived transfer factor appears to be safe for use for up to two years and bovine-derived cellular (from blood sources) transfer factor for up to three months. Side effects include fever and swelling and pain at the injection site. Concern has been raised over the possibility of catching Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease) or other diseases from animal blood-derived products. Transfer factors are contraindicated for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. When human- and bovine-derived transfer factor are generated from blood cells they carry the potential for blood-borne disease such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C. Transfer factor (dietary supplement) history, claims, and side effects Colostrum is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals (including humans) in late pregnancy. Colostrum also contains multiple immune modulating molecules, including high antibody levels. Based on studies noting an overlap in the observed in vitro effects between a molecule contained in colostrum called colostrinin and the dialyzable leukocyte extract mentioned above, a hypothesis formed that the two were the same. There has been no recent research investigations comparing the two entities and thus there is no verifiable evidence that either colostrum or egg whites do or do not contain the cellular product that shares the name transfer factor. The orally available transfer factor is not obtained from humans nor from blood products of any mammal or animal and thus does not carry the presumed risks of contracting blood-borne or animal tissue derived diseases. Retailers of dietary supplement transfer factors advice against use by those with an organ transplant or women that are pregnant. Colostrum/egg derived transfer factors have been promoted as a treatment for a large number of diseases and health concerns but have not been proven effective in the treatment of any of these conditions. The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates transfer factors as a dietary supplement and has issued a warning notice to a website selling transfer factors that they have not been proven to be effective or safe in the treatment of any condition, nor have there been any biological licenses or New Drug Applications produced for the substance.

The school admits students from kindergarten to 12th standard providing them with complete secondary education. Located in Asansol, in the Paschim Bardhaman district of the western part of West Bengal, with a distance of 200 kilometers from Kolkata (Calcutta). History St. Patrick‚Äôs School was built in the year 1891 as a Scholasticate for Belgian Jesuits. The climate of the dry plains seemed to be hard on them hence it was taken over by the Irish Christian Brothers in 1890 and opened the institution as St. Patrick‚Äôs Boarding of Anglo- Indian and European Boys.Initial Beginning The buildings were first used to host students only in 1891, founded by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious institute from Ireland that has undertaken missionary and educational work worldwide. This group, also informally known as the Christian Brothers, was founded by Edmund Ignatius Rice. St. Patrick's School, Asansol is one of the 19 Christian Brothers Schools in India. For a brief span of time during the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force was using the school buildings as airforce base and distress quarters while the administration of the School was under the Jesuit Mission of Patna and the school was shifted to Kurji.School Administration over the years Description With three sections for each class/grade from KG-10 and two section for 11-12, there are about 1,800 students enrolled in the school. The school follows the 10+2 Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations curriculum which includes the national ICSE exam at the end of Class 10, and the ISC Science exam at the end of Class 12. The school enjoys considerable recognition for academic excellence, having produced many state and national rankers. St. Patrick's was originally a fully residential school. It started admitting day scholars later, and finally closed the hostel completely in 1984. The school has enrolled girls in Classes 11 and 12 since 2009. The Jubilee Hospital Building on the grounds was built in 1918. It is no longer a functioning hospital, having closed at the same time that hostel was closed. It is currently used as a residence for some staff members. The school is one of the largest landowners in Asansol, with buildings, fields, a huge pond and acres of virgin wooded areas bordering prime real estate like the residential colony known as Hill View or other schools like Loreto Convent, Maria Goretti, St. Joseph's School and St. Vincent's School. Alumni St. Patrick's Alumni International, is the largest and oldest alumni organization, founded in 2001. It has about 4,500 alumni in its network and does not charge any fees.

The Branting Monument is a monument in Stockholm, Sweden, with a statue of the Swedish Social Democratic leader Hjalmar Branting (1860 ‚Äì 1925). The monument is 5 meters tall and 6 meters wide. The bronze relief monument, by artist Carl Eldh, is located in a small park at Norra Bantorget in Stockholm, which is the traditional Social Democratic grounds of the city. Eldh started working on the monument in 1926, one year after Branting had died, but it was erected only in 1952. The monument shows a prominent looking Branting addressing a group of workers on a May Day demonstration. Several of the worker movement's pioneers are found in the otherwise anonymous crowd of workers surrounding Branting, including Axel Danielsson and August Palm. On 17 May 1992, the monument was partly damaged when a small bomb exploded and blew up a hole in the belly of the Hjalmar Branting figure. This was the fourth in a series of five statue bombings in Stockholm that had begun on 25 February and ended on 8 June. A group of seven teenagers, six boys and one girl, were arrested a week later and confessed to the acts of vandalism. (The other statues were not political monuments, and no political motives were mentioned in the news reports.) The monument was restored two years later by the local company Herman Bergmans konstgjuteri AB, the foundry that had originally made it in the early 1950s. The restoration cost, 320,000 Swedish crowns, was shared by the City of Stockholm and the Stockholm section of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.

Gate Maritime Properties (GMP) handles waterfront industrial land, primarily at Blount Island. In 1986, the United States Marine Corps established the Biennial Maintenance Command (BMC) at Blount Island, Jacksonville, Florida on leased from GMP for $11 million per year. The lease between GMP and the Marine Corps was due to end in 2004, so in 2000, the Corp stated their intention to purchase the property when the lease expired. The Marine Corps budget included $115.7 million for the acquisition, but extended negotiations did not result in an agreement. Gate contended that the land was worth between $160 million and $200 million, so in August 2004, the Marine Corps seized on Blount Island (Gate's entire Blount Island holdings) by eminent domain and paid $101 million (later increased to $160 million). When land is seized for uses that benefit the public, the government is required to pay landowners \\"just compensation\\", so Gate asked for a jury to decide the land's value. On November 14, 2005, a jury determined that the government should pay $160 million for the parcel. Ponte Vedra Club Realty is a full service real estate company in business since 1937.

The Italians were deployed as: one battalion (Enrico Cosenz) on the right, two battalions on the left (Giacomo Medici), one battalion in the middle (Nicola Ardoino); two reserve battalions, one at Varese (Nino Bixio), and one at the Biumo Superiore hill.

It is much less common than the other type, called essential hypertension, affecting only 5-10% of hypertensive patients. It has many different causes including endocrine diseases, kidney diseases, and tumors. It also can be a side effect of many medications. Types =Kidney= Renovascular hypertension It has two main causes: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis of the renal artery resulting in stenosis. * See main article at Renovascular hypertension. Kidney Other well known causes include diseases of the kidney. This includes diseases such as polycystic kidney disease which is a cystic genetic disorder of the kidneys, PKD, which is characterized by the presence of multiple cysts (hence, \\"polycystic\\") in both kidneys, can also damage the liver, pancreas, and rarely, the heart and brain. It can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, with the autosomal dominant form being more common and characterized by progressive cyst development and bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts, with concurrent development of hypertension, chronic kidney disease and kidney pain. Or chronic glomerulonephritis which is a disease characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli, or small blood vessels in the kidneys. Hypertension can also be produced by diseases of the renal arteries supplying the kidney. This is known as renovascular hypertension; it is thought that decreased perfusion of renal tissue due to stenosis of a main or branch renal artery activates the renin‚Äìangiotensin system. Also, some renal tumors can cause hypertension. The differential diagnosis of a renal tumor in a young patient with hypertension includes Juxtaglomerular cell tumor, Wilms' tumor, and renal cell carcinoma, all of which may produce renin. Hypertension secondary to other renal disorders * Chronic kidney disease * Kidney disease / renal artery stenosis ‚Äì the normal physiological response to low blood pressure in the renal arteries is to increase cardiac output (CO) to maintain the pressure needed for glomerular filtration. Here, however, increased CO cannot solve the structural problems causing renal artery hypotension, with the result that CO remains chronically elevated. * Renal segmental hypoplasia (Ask-Upmark kidney) =Hypertension secondary to endocrine disorders= * Neurogenic hypertension ‚Äì excessive secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine which promotes vasoconstriction resulting from chronic high activity of the sympathoadrenal system, the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal gland. The specific mechanism involved is increased release of the \\"stress hormones\\", epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine which increase blood output from the heart and constrict arteries. People with neurogenic hypertension respond poorly to treatment with diuretics as the underlying cause of their hypertension is not addressed. ** Pheochromocytoma ‚Äì a tumor which results in an excessive secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine which promotes vasoconstriction * Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) ‚Äì idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, liddle's syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism), glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism * Cushing's syndrome ‚Äì an excessive secretion of glucocorticoids causes the hypertension * Hyperparathyroidism * Acromegaly * Hyperthyroidism * Hypothyroidism Adrenal A variety of adrenal cortical abnormalities can cause hypertension, In primary aldosteronism there is a clear relationship between the aldosterone-induced sodium retention and the hypertension. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a group of autosomal recessive disorders of the enzymes responsible for steroid hormone production, can lead to secondary hypertension by creating atypically high levels of mineralocorticoid steroid hormones. These mineralocorticoids cross-react with the aldosterone receptor, activating it and raising blood pressure. * 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency causes an inability to produce cortisol. Instead, extremely high levels of the precursor hormone corticosterone are produced, some of which is converted to 11-Deoxycorticosterone (DOC), a potent mineralocorticoid not normally clinically important in humans. DOC has blood-pressure raising effects similar to aldosterone, and abnormally high levels result in hypokalemic hypertension. * 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficiency, aka apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome, involves a defect in the gene for 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an enzyme that normally inactivates circulating cortisol to the less-active metabolite cortisone. At high concentrations cortisol can cross-react and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to aldosterone-like effects in the kidney, causing hypertension. This effect can also be produced by prolonged ingestion of liquorice (which can be of potent strength in liquorice candy), by causing inhibition of the 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme and likewise leading to secondary apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome. Frequently, if liquorice is the cause of the high blood pressure, a low blood level of potassium will also be present. Cortisol induced hypertension cannot be completely explained by the activity of Cortisol on Aldosterone receptors. Experiments show that treatment with Spironolactone (an inhibitor of the aldosterone receptor), does not prevent hypertension with excess cortisol. It seems that inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis may also play a role in cortisol induced hypertension. Yet another related disorder causing hypertension is glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism, which is an autosomal dominant disorder in which the increase in aldosterone secretion produced by ACTH is no longer transient, causing of primary hyperaldosteronism, the Gene mutated will result in an aldosterone synthase that is ACTH-sensitive, which is normally not. GRA appears to be the most common monogenic form of human hypertension. Compare these effects to those seen in Conn's disease, an adrenocortical tumor which causes excess release of aldosterone, that leads to hypertension. Another adrenal related cause is Cushing's syndrome which is a disorder caused by high levels of cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone secreted by the cortex of the adrenal glands. Cushing's syndrome can be caused by taking glucocorticoid drugs, or by tumors that produce cortisol or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).Kumar, Abbas, Fausto. Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th ed. Elsevier-Saunders; New York, 2005. More than 80% of patients with Cushing's syndrome develop hypertension., which is accompanied by distinct symptoms of the syndrome, such as central obesity, lipodystrophy, moon face, sweating, hirsutism and anxiety. Neuroendocrine tumors are also a well known cause of secondary hypertension. Pheochromocytoma (most often located in the adrenal medulla) increases secretion of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, causing excessive stimulation of adrenergic receptors, which results in peripheral vasoconstriction and cardiac stimulation. This diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating increased urinary excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine and/or their metabolites (vanillylmandelic acid). =Other secondary hypertension= *Hormonal contraceptives *Neurologic disorders *Obstructive sleep apnea *Liquorice (when consumed in excessive amounts) *Scleroderma *Neurofibromatosis * Pregnancy: unclear cause. * Cancers: tumours in the kidney can operate in the same way as kidney disease. More commonly, however, tumors cause inessential hypertension by ectopic secretion of hormones involved in normal physiological control of blood pressure. * Drugs: In particular, alcohol, nasal decongestants with adrenergic effects, NSAIDs, MAOIs, adrenoceptor stimulants, and combined methods of hormonal contraception (those containing ethinylestradiol) can cause hypertension while in use. **Heavy alcohol use **Steroid use **Nicotine use. * Malformed aorta, slow pulse, ischemia: these cause reduced blood flow to the renal arteries, with physiological responses as already outlined. **Coarctation of the aorta **Atherosclerosis * Anemia: unclear cause. * Fever: unclear cause. * White coat hypertension, that is, elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but not in other settings, probably due to the anxiety some people experience during a clinic visit. * Perioperative hypertension is development of hypertension just before, during or after surgery. It may occur before surgery during the induction of anesthesia; intraoperatively e.g. by pain-induced sympathetic nervous system stimulation; in the early postanesthesia period, e.g. by pain-induced sympathetic stimulation, hypothermia, hypoxia, or hypervolemia from excessive intraoperative fluid therapy; and in the 24 to 48 hours after the postoperative period as fluid is mobilized from the extravascular space. In addition, hypertension may develop perioperatively because of discontinuation of long-term antihypertensive medication. =Medication side effects= Certain medications, including NSAIDs (Motrin/Ibuprofen) and steroids can cause hypertension. Other medications include extrogens (such as those found in oral contraceptives with high estrogenic activity), certain antidepressants (such as venlafaxine), buspirone, carbamazepine, bromocriptine, clozapine, and cyclosporine. High blood pressure that is associated with the sudden withdrawal of various antihypertensive medications is called rebound hypertension. The increases in blood pressure may result in blood pressures greater than when the medication was initiated. Depending on the severity of the increase in blood pressure, rebound hypertension may result in a hypertensive emergency. Rebound hypertension is avoided by gradually reducing the dose (also known as \\"dose tapering\\"), thereby giving the body enough time to adjust to reduction in dose. Medications commonly associated with rebound hypertension include centrally-acting antihypertensive agents, such as clonidine and methyl-dopa. Other herbal or \\"natural products\\" which have been associated with hypertension include ma huang, St John's wort, and licorice. =Pregnancy= Few women of childbearing age have high blood pressure, up to 11% develop hypertension of pregnancy. While generally benign, it may herald three complications of pregnancy: pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome and eclampsia. Follow-up and control with medication is therefore often necessary. =Sleep disturbances= Another common and under-recognized cause of hypertension is sleep apnea, which is often best treated with nocturnal nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but other approaches include the Mandibular advancement splint (MAS), UPPP, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, septoplasty, or weight loss. Another cause is an exceptionally rare neurological disease called Binswanger's disease, causing dementia; it is a rare form of multi- infarct dementia, and is one of the neurological syndromes associated with hypertension. =Arsenic exposure= Because of the ubiquity of arsenic in ground water supplies and its effect on cardiovascular health, low dose arsenic poisoning should be inferred as a part of the pathogenesis of idiopathic hypertension. Idiopathic and essential are both somewhat synonymous with primary hypertension. Arsenic exposure has also many of the same signs of primary hypertension such as headache, somnolence, Arsenic trioxide drugs dot com confusion, proteinuria atsdr-medical management guidelines for arsenic trioxide visual disturbances, and nausea and vomiting Arsenic Author: Frances M Dyro, MD, Chief of the Neuromuscular Section, Associate Professor, Department of Neurology, New York Medical College, Westchester Medical Center =Potassium deficiency= Due to the role of intracellular potassium in regulation of cellular pressures related to sodium, establishing potassium balance has been shown to reverse hypertension.

Roland Gumpert, who founded Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur in 2004, once held the position of director of Audi Sport. Under his management, Audi won a total of 25 World Rally Championship rallies and four World Rally Championship titles. History The two Gumpert Apollo Prototypes with an F-4 Phantom II fighter jet In 2001, Roland Gumpert proposed a new generation of sports car, one that would be race-ready yet also street-legal. After Gumpert returned to Germany from China at the end of 2001, his former colleague at Audi and founder of Motoren Technik Mayer, Roland Meyer, asked him to assist in building a prototype sports car. Audi approved Gumpert's involvement in this project on the condition that the new sports car would be a series product and not a prototype. The company was founded in 2004 under the name \\"GMG Sportwagenmanufaktur Altenburg GmbH\\". The technical guidelines were defined and the first designs of the car were drawn by Marco Vanetta. Upon Vanetta's completion of this process, the first 1:4 scale model of Gumpert's car was produced in 2002. Gumpert continued with the development of the car now called the Apollo, along with the Technical University of Munich and the Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences. They assisted him with the construction work, computer simulations, and wind tunnel tests. This research and development helped form the blueprint for the first full-scale model. Finally two prototype cars were constructed. The production of the Apollo started in October 2005. Many variants of the Apollo were introduced throughout its production cycle. On July 27, 2008, an Apollo Sport was featured on the UK automotive show Top Gear. One of the presenters, Richard Hammond and professional driver the Stig drove the car. With a lap time of 1:17.1, the Apollo Sport became the new leader on the Power Lap Board, 0.2 seconds faster than the former lap leader, the Ascari A10. The Apollo was faster than the Bugatti Veyron and the Pagani Zonda around the Top Gear test track. It was later beaten with a time of 01:16.8 by the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. In August 2013, the company filed for bankruptcy and went into liquidation after an anonymous backer pulled out of a deal that could have saved the company. In January 2016, the company was purchased by Hong Kong consortium Ideal Team Venture which is also owner of the De Tomaso marque. The company was renamed Apollo Automobil GmbH after the acquisition by its new owner. alt= At the March 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Apollo unveiled the Arrow, a sports car that is powerd by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 engine rated at . The Arrow can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.9 seconds, and has a projected top speed of . Intensa Emozione on track In November 2016, the company announced that former owner and founder Roland Gumpert was no longer associated with the company or its current or future projects and also announced a new model (project name ‚ÄòTitan‚Äô) would be unveiled at the June 2017 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The new model is named Intensa Emozione (Intense Emotion in Italian) and is powered by the 6.3 L naturally-aspirated V12 engine. The car has radical styling inspired by insects in nature. The Intensa Emozione is built in collaboration with HWA AG, the same company involved in the construction of the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR. Development partners Apollo collaborated with several business and technical partners, including the following: The Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur Factory * Autotecnica Motori (engine development) * Apollo Germany Limited (paints and repairs) * ATS Group (development and production of wheels) * BFFT (automotive electronics) * Bosch Group (automobile components and systems, including ABS and TCS) * BREMBO (brakes) * Eibach (sports chassis development) * HS Genion (automotive engineering) * KBF Kabelbaumfertigung (the Apollo's cabling, measuring 4.2 km) * KW Automotive (sport suspension systems) * Mero TSK (Mengeringhausen tube system) * Pirelli (road and racing tyres) * TRW (active and passive vehicle safety systems) * Technical University of Munich (virtual prototyping, vibration technology and driver-vehicle interaction) * WIDOS (welding plastic tubing and moulded parts) * Contrust (optimized risk management) * Evolution MotorSports (US development partner and distribution) * GTE Engineering (development and production of kevlar clutch facing) * HWA AG (development and final details for the Intensa Emozione) Motorsport The Apollo Hybrid race car During April 2005, the Apollo made its racing debut in the Divinol Cup. This Apollo was driven by the Belgian race driver Ruben Maes. Maes finished third on the Hockenheimring race track. Three years later Gumpert announced that they would enter a hybrid electric version of the Apollo in the 2008 24 Hours N√ºrburgring, driven by 2004 winner Dirk M√ºller and former Formula One racer Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Three months passed between the first discussions and the finished hybrid Apollo. The Apollo was driven in the 24 Hours N√ºrburgring in May 2008. The hybrid Apollo can deliver up to , powered with a 3.3 litre V8 bi-turbo engine coupled with a electric motor. The car has the ability to recharge the battery under braking.

It began as an alternative, theatrical circus without animals, featuring dangerous stunts like chainsaw juggling, fire breathing, wall of death, etc. The company is considered a pioneer of the contemporary circus. Today, Archaos is based in Marseille, France and is a designated P√¥le National des Arts du Cirque. Archaos is also the main organiser of the Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque, the world's largest contemporary circus festival. History Archaos found fame in the UK through Pierrot's association with Adrian Evans, who promoted the company there. Shows included Chapiteau des Cordes, Bouinax, BX91 and Metal Clown.

In September 2010, an exhibition in London displayed the Archaos archive of films, photos, audio, etc. Ex-members travelled from all over the world to be at the five-day event. The exhibition was held in memory of Archaos founder Pierrot Bidon, who died earlier in the year. The obituary in The Guardian celebrating Bidon's life noted that Archaos was \\"one of the ensembles that galvanised the new circus movement, in which traditional arts have been re-imagined and combined with contemporary artistic sensibilities and theatrical techniques.\\" A website hosting an archive of Archaos is online.Institut de formation professionnelle, Luis Orelha Most recently, Archaos was nominated for the Best Producer award for the L'Entre- Deux Biennales project at the 2016 Annual International Professional Circus Awards in Sochi, Russia.

Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque Archaos took a major role in the Circus in Capitals project that was part of Marseille Provence 2013 and the experience inspired the company to create the first Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque. The first edition was held in the Aix Marseille Provence Metropolis and across the Provence Alpes C√¥te d'Azur region in 2015. With more than 50 international companies and close to 100,000 spectators, the Biennale quickly established itself as the largest circus festival in the world.

An early aspirant to the A‚à¥A‚à¥ (the 20th to be admitted as a Probationer, in December 1909) who \\"claimed\\" the grade of Magister Templi as a Neophyte. He also became an O.T.O. initiate, serving as the principal organizer for that order in British Columbia, Canada. He worked under a variety of mottos and acronymic titles, including V.I.O. (Unus in Omnibus, \\"One in All,\\" as an A‚à¥A‚à¥ Probationer), O.I.V.V.I.O., V.I.O.O.I.V., Parzival (as an Adeptus Minor and O.T.O. Ninth Degree), and Tantalus Leucocephalus (as Tenth Degree O.T.O.), but he is best known under his Neophyte motto \\"Achad\\" (, \\"unity\\"), which he used as a byline in his various published writings. Early life Jones was born in London on 2 April 1886. He became an accountant. Prior to joining the A‚à¥A‚à¥, he investigated Spiritualism, as recounted in the notes of his magical progress, \\"A Master of the Temple.\\" Jones as the Magical Child of Aleister Crowley Having been recruited through Crowley's publication The Equinox in 1909, he was attracted to the A‚à¥A‚à¥ 's avowed motto of 'The Method of Science, the aim of Religion' and became the twentieth person to join Aleister Crowley's A‚à¥A‚à¥ order. Jones' motto as a Probationer was Vnvs in Omnibvs (V.I.O.), and his supervising Neophyte was J. F. C. Fuller (Per Ardua). When Fuller later withdrew from the A‚à¥A‚à¥, Aleister Crowley took over as Jones' superior. Jones advanced to Neophyte, taking the motto Achad, which he was subsequently to use for most of his published writings, and by which he is best known. Jones continued his work under Crowley in the Outer Order of A‚à¥A‚à¥ until the former decided to \\"take 8=3, in case that is what the Master really needed,\\" i.e. to claim the grade of Magister Templi in the Third Order, thus assisting Crowley's advancement to the further grade of Magus, by filling \\"the Master's\\" current position in the A‚à¥A‚à¥ hierarchy. Jones took the Magister Templi obligation (i.e. \\"the Oath of the Abyss\\") and notified Crowley. The news came as a profound revelation to Crowley. Nine months earlier he had been involved in a set of sex-magical operations with Sr. Hilarion (Jeanne Robert Foster) in an apparently unsuccessful effort to conceive a child. Crowley noted the nine- month interval and concluded that Jones' \\"birth\\" as a Babe of the Abyss qualified him as the \\"magical child\\" of Crowley and Hilarion. He welcomed Jones to the Third Order, and declared him to be his \\"beloved son.\\" Eventually, goaded by suggestions from Jones and impressed by his qabalistic insights into Thelema's founding volume, The Book of the Law (especially his essay \\"Liber 31\\"), Crowley came to consider the younger man the \\"child\\" and the \\"one\\" prophesied in the book (in I:55‚Äì56 and similar passages). =Ouija board= Crowley and Jones frequently discussed the Ouija board and it is often mentioned in their unpublished letters. Throughout 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones:, \\"Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate.\\" Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Charles Stansfeld Jones wrote a book called 'Crystal Vision through Crystal Gazing, in which he notes that in relationship to skrying (also spelled scrying) \\"the case of the Ouija Board applies equally to the Crystal.\\"Cornelius, J. Edward Aleister Crowley and the Ouija Board. 2005 Work in O.T.O. Inspired by the fifth point of the Task of a Zelator in the A‚à¥A‚à¥ system, Jones sought from Crowley the authority to begin O.T.O. initiatory work in Canada. The result was the first operation of the Mysteria Mystica Maxima degrees in North America, and the founding of British Columbia Lodge No. 1, where the original founders of Agape Lodge were first initiated. Baphomet (Aleister Crowley) awarded Jones all O.T.O. degrees through the Seventh expedentiae causa in 1915. Jones was not given the IX¬∞ until he demonstrated a knowledge of the Supreme Secret of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis in correspondence with Crowley. On his admission to the Ninth Degree, Jones took the magical name Parzival. Jones became Grand Treasurer General after Crowley removed George Macnie Cowie from the post in 1918. Crowley and Jones soon came to disagreement about the management of Order funds, and Jones resigned from O.T.O. altogether in 1918. Crowley did not accept Jones' resignation, however, and Jones was eventually made Grand Master (X¬∞) for North America by Theodor Reuss. Jones and the German initiate Heinrich Traenker were the Grand Masters who confirmed Crowley in his succession to the office of Outer Head of the O.T.O. in 1925. Jones' organizing interests were never fired by O.T.O. after the early work of British Columbia Lodge. At Crowley's later request, Jones resigned from the office of National Grand Master General. Although Crowley formally expelled Jones from the Order in 1936, Jones nevertheless considered himself \\"Past Grand Master for the United States of America\\" until his death. Involvement in U.B. In 1921, Jones joined the Universal Brotherhood (U.B.), also known to its members as the Integral Fellowship or as the Mahacakra Society (or M.), depending on their level of participation. This group had been actively recruiting among Theosophists for a decade or more, and Jones was one of a number of prominent Thelemites who eventually joined. The methods of the U.B. involved one-to-one correspondence, with an elaborate set of rules regarding strict secrecy of instructions, envelopes-within-envelopes, purple typewriter ribbons, and special paperclips. Aspirants were provided with typescript lectures (\\"sutras\\") on metaphysical topics, using idiosyncratic terms like \\"integrality\\" and \\"partitivity.\\" A system of alms provided for funds to be remitted back up the same chain down which these instructions descended. Organizational titles and pseudonyms in the U.B. were generally taken from Sanskrit. Few U.B. writings have become accessible to non-members, but those that have, taken with Jones' writings in the U.B. vein, suggest that their doctrines involved a baroquely intellectualized form of sentimental monotheism. In 1924, Jones was superintending about 70 members of U.B., and he formed a plan for subsuming Thelema into the U.B. as a Grama or \\"Integral Body,\\" which would perpetuate some O.T.O. and A‚à¥A‚à¥ materials \\"in their pure form.\\" He communicated this idea to Wilfred T. Smith, who was at that time his subordinate in both the U.B. and A‚à¥A‚à¥, but Smith's interest in the U.B. was slight and waning. Annie Besant, as head of the Theosophical Society, strictly forbade cross-membership in the U.B. As Crowley became aware of the involvement of his followers, he likewise denounced the U.B., calling it a \\"swindle\\" in correspondence with Jones. Many of those who left the Theosophical Society for the U.B. under pressure from Besant later converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1928, Jones himself became a Roman Catholic, undergoing baptism and confirmation into the laity of that church. At roughly the same time, he succeeded to the U.B. office of Mahaguru, thus becoming the chief of that organization. Jones continued to hold that office, apparently until his death. Jones was succeeded as Mahaguru by John P. Kowal (1900‚Äì1978). The true aims of the U.B. remain obscure, but it has been accused by Wilfred Talbot Smith, among others, of acting as a front for Roman Catholic infiltration of occult groups; and by former member Paul Foster Case of being inspired by the Bavarian Illuminati. Mahaguru John P. Kowal told Martin Starr that its purpose was \\"to make men think.\\" Rumors of insanity and imprisonment In late 1917 Jones was arrested in a Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada hotel, where he had been behaving erratically. He was imprisoned on suspicion of being a draft dodger who was pretending to be insane. He was released after three days. Kenneth Grant, writing in The Magical Revival, claims that on Jones' return to Vancouver circa 1930, he was wearing only a raincoat, which he proceeded to throw off, and then circumambulated the center of the city as a magical operation of some sort, was arrested, and had a stay in a mental institution. This story, which Grant may have had directly from Crowley, is in all likelihood a confusion of the 1917 incident with the \\"insanity\\" of Jones' 1928 baptism and 1929 confirmation in the Roman Catholic Church. Personal life Jones' wife, whom he married in England prior to moving to the US and then Canada, was Prudence Rubina Stansfeld Jones n√©e Wratton (1887‚Äì1981), often known as 'Ruby' or sometimes as 'Prue.' According to Crowley associate C.F. Russell, Jones met her in a brothel. Their adopted daughter was Deirdre Georgina Stansfeld Jones, known familiarly as Dede. (1912‚Äì1969).Starr, Martin P. The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites.(Teitan Press, 2003), p. 14 Like most members of Jones' British Columbia Lodge No 1 of the O.T.O., Ruby Jones advanced to the Third Degree (III0) in 1915.Starr, Martin P. The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites.(Teitan Press, 2003), p. 37 Anthony (Tony) Francis Stansfeld Jones (b. 1934 ‚Äì ) was an adopted son of the Jones family; Ruby took in many foster children over the years. Since both Charles and Rubina had joined the Catholic Church in 1929, the children were raised Catholic. According to Tony Stansfeld Jones, the parents held Catholic masses in their Deep Cove, North Vancouver home for many years, later holding them in a local community hall. The novelist Malcolm Lowry who lived in the community of Maplewood Flats (now Maplewood Flats Conservation Area) north of Vancouver from 1938‚Äì1944 was a close friend of the family and C S Jones helped him with his manuscripts. In 1950, C S Jones developed pneumonia after catching cold while waiting for a bus, and died within three days. The family's joint grave is in North Vancouver Cemetery, North Vancouver, BC Canada. . Bibliography After two of his pieces had been published in Crowley's journal The Equinox, Jones self- published his book Q.B.L., and then wrote several books that were issued through William Walker Atkinson's Yogi Publication Society of Chicago. Jones self-published others with a \\"Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum, Publications Department\\" imprint. Many of his writings remained unpublished on his death.

The AIS replaces the failed data, allowing the higher order system in the concatenation to maintain its transmission framing integrity. Downstream intermediate elements of the transport circuit propagate the AIS onwards to the destination element. There are various AIS formats based on the signaling level of the errored circuit. When an element of T-1 or (DS-1) circuit loses signal (LOS) or framing (OOF), the device replaces the erroneous data bits with a series of ones. This is where the term All Ones originates. At the DS3 signal level, the intermediate element receiving an errored signal replaces the errored channel data with a signal consisting of a valid DS-3 frame with the overhead bits (the M-subframe alignment bits, M-frame alignment bits, and P bits) with the payload set to a 1010... sequence, the C bits all set to zero, and the X bits set to one. This way, the integrity of the DS-3 frame is maintained even though the underlying data was compromised. There are a number of types of AIS signals, which signal failure of different logical or physical segments of the system, including: * Alarm indication signal path (AIS-P) * Alarm indication signal line (AIS-L)12 These are SONET OC-xx level indications that indicate if the errored element is in a section, segment, line segment, or path segment of the SONET circuit. Middle 20th century analog carrier systems had Carrier Group Alarms by which the failure of a pilot signal was alerted to telephone exchange equipment, imposing an automated make-busy condition so the trunks carried by the failed system would not be used. The improved AIS originated with the T-carrier system, and became a standard feature of subsequent plesiochronous and synchronous circuit-based communication systems, and is also part of the ATM standards. As the use of Ethernet for long-distance data links has increased, the need for a similar end-to-end OA&M; function has led to the development of a similar Ethernet alarm indication signal (EthAIS).

Occasionally it is also used in corporate accounts. It can be defined in three ways: *It is a specific statistical concept, also known as net investment, used in national accounts statistics, econometrics and macroeconomics. In that sense, it refers to a measure of the net additions to the (physical) capital stock of a country (or an economic sector) in an accounting interval, or, a measure of the amount by which the total physical capital stock increased during an accounting period. To arrive at this measure, standard valuation principles are used.Lequiller, F.; Blades, D.: Understanding National Accounts, Paris: OECD 2006, pp. 133‚Äì137. United Nations: The System of National Accounts 2008 - SNA 2008, New York, 2009, Chapter 10: The capital account *It is used also in economic theory, as a modern general term for capital accumulation, referring to the total \\"stock of capital\\" that has been formed, or to the growth of this total capital stock.Yanovsky, M.: Anatomy of Social Accounting Systems, London; Chapman & Hall, 1965. *In a much broader or vaguer sense, the term \\"capital formation\\" has in more recent times been used in financial economics to refer to savings drives, setting up financial institutions, fiscal measures, public borrowing, development of capital markets, privatization of financial institutions, development of secondary markets. In this usage, it refers to any method for increasing the amount of capital owned or under one's control, or any method in utilising or mobilizing capital resources for investment purposes. Thus, capital could be \\"formed\\" in the sense of \\"being brought together for investment purposes\\" in many different ways. This broadened meaning is not related to the statistical measurement concept nor to the classical understanding of the concept in economic theory. Instead, it originated in credit-based economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, which was accompanied by the rapid growth of the financial sector, and consequently the increased use of finance terminology in economic discussions. Use in national accounts statistics In the national accounts (e.g., in the United Nations System of National Accounts and the European System of Accounts) gross capital formation is the total value of the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), plus net changes in inventories, plus net acquisitions less disposals of valuables for a unit or sector.Ruggles, Richard; Ruggles, Nancy D.: National Income Accounts and Income Analysis. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1956. \\"Total capital formation\\" in national accounting equals net fixed capital investment, plus the increase in the value of inventories held, plus (net) lending to foreign countries, during an accounting period (a year or a quarter). Capital is said to be \\"formed\\" when savings are utilized for investment purposes, often investment in production. In the USA, statistical measures for capital formation were pioneered by Simon Kuznets in the 1930s and 1940s,Kuznets, Simon et al., National income and capital formation, 1919-1935. National Bureau of Economic Research, 1937. Kuznets, Simon: Commodity flow and capital formation. New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1938. Kuznets, Simon: Gross capital formation, 1919-1933. New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1934. Kuznets, Simon: \\"Proportion of capital formation to national product\\". American Economic Review, 1952. Kuznets, Simon: Capital in the American Economy Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961. and from the 1950s onwards the standard accounting system devised under the auspices of the United Nations to measure capital flows was adopted officially by the governments of most countries. International bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have been influential in revising the system. Different interpretations The use of the terms \\"capital formation\\" and \\"investment\\" can be somewhat confusing, partly because the concept of capital itself can be understood in different ways. *Firstly, capital formation is frequently thought of as a measure of total \\"investment\\", in the sense of that portion of capital actually used for investment purposes and not held as savings or consumed. But in fact, in national accounts, the concept of gross capital formation refers only to the accounting value of the \\"additions of non-financial produced assets to the capital stock less the disposals of these assets\\". \\"Investment\\" is a broader concept that includes investment in all kinds of capital assets, whether physical property or financial assets. In its statistical meaning, capital formation does not include financial assets such as stocks and securities. *Secondly, capital formation may be used synonymously with the notion of capital accumulation in the sense of a reinvestment of profits into capital assets. But \\"capital accumulation\\" is not normally an accounting concept in modern accounts (although it is sometimes used by the IMF and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), and contains the ambiguity that an amassment of wealth could occur either through a redistribution of capital assets from one person or institution to another, or through a net addition to the total stock of capital in existence. As regards capital accumulation, it can flourish, so that some people become wealthier, although society as a whole becomes poorer, and the net capital formation decreases. In other words, the gain could be a net total gain, or a gain at the expense of loss by others that cancels out (or more than cancels out) the gain in aggregate. *Thirdly, gross capital formation is often used synonymously with gross fixed capital formation but strictly speaking this is an error because gross capital formation refers to more net asset gains than just fixed capital (it also includes net gains in inventory stocklevels and the balance of funds lent abroad). Capital formation measures were originally designed to provide a picture of investment and growth of the \\"real economy\\" in which goods and services are produced using tangible capital assets. The measures were intended to identify changes in the growth of physical wealth across time. However, the international growth of the financial sector has created many structural changes in the way that business investments occur, and in the way capital finance is really organized. This not only affects the definition of the measures, but also how economists interpret capital formation. The most recent alterations in national accounts standards mean that capital measures and many other measures are no longer fully comparable with the data of the past, except where the old data series have been revised to align them with the new concepts and definitions. US government statisticians have admitted frankly that \\"Unfortunately, the finance sector is one of the more poorly measured sectors in national accounts\\".Dennis J Fixler, Marshall B Reinsdorf and Shaunda Villones, \\"Measuring the services of commercial banks in the NIPA.\\" IFC Bulletin No. 33 (Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics, Bank of International Settlements), 2007. The main reason is that national accounts were at first primarily designed to capture changes in tangible physical wealth, not financial wealth (in the form of financial claims). Gross and net capital formation In economic statistics and accounts, capital formation can be valued gross, i.e., before deduction of consumption of fixed capital (or \\"depreciation\\"), or net, i.e., after deduction of \\"depreciation\\" write-offs. *The gross valuation method views \\"depreciation\\" as a portion of the new income or wealth earned or created by the enterprise, and hence as part of the formation of new capital by the enterprise. *The net valuation method views \\"depreciation\\" as the compensation for the cost of replacing fixed equipment used up or worn out, which must be deducted from the total investment volume to obtain a measure of the \\"real\\" value of investments; the depreciation write-off compensates and cancels out the loss in capital value of assets used due to wear & tear, obsolescence, etc. Because of government tax-incentives and valuation issues, depreciation charged by businesses is rarely a true reflection of the loss in value of their capital stock. Hence, statisticians often revalue actual depreciation charges according to data about asset values and average service lives of assets, in order to obtain measures of true \\"economic depreciation\\". Technical measurement issues Capital formation is notoriously difficult to measure statistically, mainly because of the valuation problems involved in establishing what the value of capital assets is. When a fixed asset or inventory is bought, it may be reasonably clear what its market value is, namely the purchaser's price. But as soon as it is bought, its value may change, and it may change even before it is put to use. Things often become more complicated to measure when a new fixed asset is acquired within some kind of lease agreement. Finally, the rate at which the value of the fixed asset depreciates will affect the gross and net valuation of the asset, yet different methods are typically used to value what assets are worth and how fast they depreciate. Capital assets can for instance be valued at: *historic cost (acquisition cost) *current replacement cost *current sale or resale value *average market value *business value, assuming a certain profit yield *value for tax purposes, *value for insurance purposes *purchasing power parity value *scrap value. A business owner may in fact not even know what his business is \\"worth\\" as a going concern, in terms of its current market value. The \\"book value\\" of a capital stock may differ greatly from its \\"market value\\", and another figure may apply for taxation purposes. The value of capital assets may also be overstated or understated using various legal constructions. For any significant business, how assets are valued makes a big difference to its earnings and thus the correct statement of asset values is a perpetually controversial subject. During an accounting period, additions may be made to capital assets (including those that disproportionately increase the value of the capital stock) and capital assets are also disposed of; at the same time, physical assets also incur depreciation or Consumption of fixed capital. Also, price inflation may affect the value of the capital stock. In national accounts, there are additional problems: * The sales/purchases of one enterprise can be the investment of another enterprise. Therefore, to obtain a measure of the total net capital formation, a system of grossing and netting of capital flows is required. Without this, double counting would occur. * Capital expenditure must be distinguished from intermediate expenditure and other operating expenditure, but the boundaries are sometimes difficult to draw. * There exists nowadays a large market in second-hand (used) assets. In principle, statistical measures of gross fixed capital formation are supposed to refer to the net additions of newly produced fixed assets, which enlarge the total stock of fixed capital in the economy. But if a substantial trade occurs in fixed assets resold from one enterprise or one country to another, it may become difficult to know what the real net addition to the stock of fixed capital of a country actually is. A precise distinction between \\"new\\" and \\"used\\" assets becomes more difficult to draw. How to value used assets and their depreciation consistently becomes more problematic. The general trend in accounting standards is for assets to be valued increasingly at \\"current market value\\", but this valuation is by no means absolutely clear and uncontroversial. It might be understood to mean the price of the asset if it was sold at a balance date, or the current replacement cost of the asset, or the average price of the asset type in the market at a certain date, etc. Perpetual Inventory Method A method often used in econometrics to estimate the value of the physical capital stock of an industrial sector or the whole economy is the so-called Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM). Starting off from a benchmark stock value for capital held, and expressing all values in constant dollars using a price index, known additions to the stock are added, and known disposals as well as depreciation are subtracted year by year (or quarter by quarter). Thus, an historical data series is obtained for the growth of the capital stock over a period of time. In so doing, assumptions are made about the real rate of price inflation, realistic depreciation rates, average service lives of physical capital assets, and so on. The PIM stock values can be compared with various other related economic variables and trends, and adjusted further to obtain the most accurate and credible valuation Controversy According to one popular kind of macro-economic definition in textbooks, capital formation refers to \\"the transfer of savings from households and governments to the business sector, resulting in increased output and economic expansion\\" (see Circular flow of income). The idea here is that individuals and governments save money, and then invest that money in the private sector, which produces more wealth with it. This definition is however inaccurate on two counts: *Firstly, many larger corporations engage in corporate self-financing, i.e., financing from their own reserves and undistributed profits, or through loans from (or share issues bought by) other corporations. In other words, the textbook definition ignores that the largest source of investment capital consists of financial institutions, not individuals or households or governments. Admittedly, financial institutions are, \\"in the last instance\\", mostly owned by individuals, but those individuals have little control over this transfer of funds, nor do they accomplish the transfer themselves. Few individuals can say they \\"own\\" a corporation, any more than individuals \\"own\\" the public sector. James M. Poterba (1987) found that changes in corporate saving are only partly offset (between 25% and 50%) by changes in household saving in the United States.Poterba, James: \\"Tax Policy and Corporate Saving\\", in Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2, 1987, pp. 455‚Äì503. Social accountants Richard Ruggles and Nancy D. Ruggles established for the USA that \\"almost all financial savings done by households is used to pay for household capital formation - particularly, housing and consumer durables. On net, the household sector channels almost no financial savings to the enterprise sector. Conversely, almost all the capital formation done by enterprises is financed through enterprise savings - particularly, undistributed gross profits.\\"Edward N. Wolff, \\"In Memoriam: Richard Ruggles 1916-2001\\", in: Review of Income and Wealth, Series 47, Number 3, September 2001, p. 414. *Secondly, the transfer of funds to corporations may not result in increased output or economic expansion at all; given excess capacity, a low rate of return and/or lacklustre demand, corporations may not in fact invest those funds to expand output, and engage in asset speculation instead, to obtain property income that boosts shareholder returns. To illustrate, New Zealand's Finance Minister Michael Cullen stated that \\"My sense is that there are definite gains to be made, both economic and social, in increasing the savings level of New Zealanders and in encouraging diversification in assets away from the residential property market.\\"NZ Herald, 24 February 2005. This idea is based on a flawed understanding of capital formation, ignoring the real issue - which is that the flow of mortgage repayments by households to financial institutions is not being used to expand output and employment on a scale that could repay escalating private sector debts. In reality, more and more local income and assets are appropriated by foreign share-holders and creditors in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan . In December 2012, managed funds statistics compiled by the NZ Reserve Bank indicated that New Zealanders have 49.8% of their KiwiSaver money invested overseas. These managed fund figures include capital contributions, capital gains and losses and dividends and interest received.Brian Gaynor, \\"Wrong decisions send our savings overseas.\\" New Zealand Herald, 8 December 2012. The concept of \\"household saving\\" must itself also be looked at critically, since a lot of this \\"saving\\" in reality consists precisely of investing in housing, which, given low interest rates and rising real estate prices, yields a better return than if you kept your money in the bank (or, in some cases, if you invested in shares). In other words, a mortgage from a bank can effectively function as a \\"savings scheme\\" although officially it is not regarded as \\"savings\\".

It is mostly known for its role in creating the innovative Alphaville concept of business and gated residential condominia. The firm was founded in 1951 by two young civil engineers, Renato de Albuquerque and Yojiro Takaoka, who were colleagues and graduated together in 1949, in the course at the Escola Polit√©cnica da Universidade de S√£o Paulo (Polytechnic School), a traditional and high-quality engineering college in S√£o Paulo. Initially the small firm developed building projects of residential houses and small public and commercial buildings, including a church. With the boom of public works in the state, they soon got a piece of action and began working in heavy construction, such as bridges and viaducts, canals, larger public buildings, etc. The company also built several housing projects for the poor (Banco Nacional da Habita√ß√£o). In the 1970s, the company diversified into building residential high rises in the city of S√£o Paulo, and created the concept of gated vertical condominia, with the first of its kind, \\"Ilhas do Sul\\", in 1973. In the succeeding years, it developed the first \\"Alphaville\\", in the county of Barueri, and two other luxury condominia, \\"Aldeia da Serra\\" (near Alphaville) and \\"Toque-Toque Pequeno\\", in the beaches of the Northern coast of the state. With the death of Yojiro Takaoka, the company changed its name to Albuquerque & Takaoka Participa√ß√µes, Ltda. and the Alphaville projects were passed to Alphaville Urbanismo.

Description The Serra del Montsec consists of a series of calcareous mountain ranges running roughly from east to west. The range system is about 40 km long and 186.96 square kilometres in area. The Montsec is located in the Catalan province of Lleida and the Aragonese province of Huesca in Spain.  Geography  The name Montsec derives from the Latin Montus sectus, which makes reference to its characteristic rock formations. It marks the southern limit of the Pallars regionFrancesc Fit√© Llevot, La Toponimia en la Geografia del MontsecJosep Pla i Casadevall, El Pallars √©s una comarca natural prodigiosa and is divided into three main massifs by 3 of the most important rivers in Catalonia: *Montsec de R√∫bies, the eastern massif, is separated by the river Segre in the east and the Noguera Pallaresa in the middle, *Montsec d'Ares, the central massif. *Montsec d'Estall, in Aragon, located to the west, separated by the Noguera Ribagor√ßana from the central massif. Two gorges (congostos), those of Terradets and Montrebei, or Bonremei, have been opened by the action of the rivers and tectonic movements. The highest peak, Santal√≠s, is found in the central massif, standing at 1,678 metres, and dominates views over √Äger and the plains of Lleida to the south and the Pyrenees to the north. The southern face is virtually a great wall with a \\"step\\" about two-thirds of the way up, and the northern side, although by no means as steep, still stands at 1,000 metres above the Tremp basin below. =Geographical features= File:Sant Al√≠s.JPGSant Al√≠s a 1.675 m high peak in Serra del Montsec File:Llimiana.

File:Cor√ß√†, la Noguera, Catalunya (A SiT D9796).jpgView of Cor√ß√†, √Äger municipality, with the Montsec d'Estall in the background.  Formation  Montsec's formation goes back to when sediments of several thousand metres deep were deposited in the Cretaceous sea, raised and partly covered by the Eocene sea, and then raised again by Pyrenean folding. Fossils from the Mesozoic era are relatively easy to find, and at Vilanova de Mei√† the deposits there are one of the most important in the world.  History  Montsec stands in a natural defensive position over the plains and is relatively protected from the icy winds from the north, and as such its strategic aspect was very important in times of the Reconquista. In the 10th century, when the caliphate of C√≥rdoba was at its height, Balaguer was the northernmost Arab city, and the castles of Castell√≥ de Farfanya, Algerri, and Os de Balaguer were satellite fortifications which, together with a barrier of well-placed watch towers, formed the line of defense against the Christians to the north of Montsec. In the 11th and 18th centuries the area had one of the densest populations in Catalonia, but the population level began to fall at the beginning of the 20th century, and nowadays emigration is prominent and many villages are virtually abandoned.  Economy  The difficulty of irrigation makes for a very limited agriculture in the area. Local farmers cultivate mostly some barley and almonds. Hydroelectric power is another resource but most of all planners are looking to tourist development to give the region an important boost.

Semantic translation takes advantage of semantics that associate meaning with individual data elements in one dictionary to create an equivalent meaning in a second system. An example of semantic translation is the conversion of XML data from one data model to a second data model using formal ontologies for each system such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). This is frequently required by intelligent agents that wish to perform searches on remote computer systems that use different data models to store their data elements. The process of allowing a single user to search multiple systems with a single search request is also known as federated search. Semantic translation should be differentiated from data mapping tools that do simple one-to-one translation of data from one system to another without actually associating meaning with each data element. Semantic translation requires that data elements in the source and destination systems have \\"semantic mappings\\" to a central registry or registries of data elements. The simplest mapping is of course where there is equivalence. There are three types of Semantic equivalence: * Class Equivalence - indicating that class or \\"concepts\\" are equivalent. For example: \\"Person\\" is the same as \\"Individual\\" * Property Equivalence - indicating that two properties are equivalent. For example: \\"PersonGivenName\\" is the same as \\"FirstName\\" * Instance Equivalence - indicating that two individual instances of objects are equivalent. For example: \\"Dan Smith\\" is the same person as \\"Daniel Smith\\" Semantic translation is very difficult if the terms in a particular data model do not have direct one-to-one mappings to data elements in a foreign data model. In that situation an alternative approach must be used to find mappings from the original data to the foreign data elements. This problem can be alleviated by centralized metadata registries that use the ISO-11179 standards such as the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM).

He also played for Leeds United and Leicester City before finishing his career with Blackpool. He made three appearances for England. He was appointed Academy Director at Manchester City in 2017.https://www.eurosport.com/football/jason- wilcox-lands-manchester-city-academy-directorship_sto6363358/story.shtml Club career =Blackburn Rovers= Wilcox joined Blackburn Rovers at the age of sixteen after his father wrote to the club asking for a trial. After impressing at training on Sunday, Wilcox signed a contract on the Monday, before playing in the FA Youth Cup final only weeks after. Rovers youth-team manager Jim Furnell described him as \\"one of the best young midfielders in English football\\". Wilcox would go on to score 33 goals in over 300 games with Blackburn, whom he also captained. Wilcox was one of the only first-team players of that era who came from the club's own youth system and was not signed from other teams with the multimillion-pound investments of Jack Walker. He played an important part in the title-winning Blackburn team of 1995. Playing on the left flank with attacking fullback Graeme Le Saux behind him and Stuart Ripley on the opposite flank, they forged a strong attacking line-up with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton. International recognition was harder to come by for Wilcox and he managed only 3 international caps despite his effective partnership with Shearer, Le Saux and Tim Sherwood. Lengthy injury problems restricted his effectiveness in subsequent seasons and, after experiencing relegation with Blackburn, he moved on to Leeds United for ¬£4 million in December 1999. With the club having just been relegated and with the emergence of Damien Duff, Rovers saw it as good business for a successful youth product. He was Blackburn's longest serving player at the time of joining Leeds. =Leeds United= Wilcox, who scored on his debut, played in his usual position as a left-sided midfielder at Leeds, moving Harry Kewell into a more advanced role. He helped the Yorkshire side to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, where they lost to Galatasaray. A year later he was part of the club's run to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals, where they lost again, this time to eventually consecutive runners-up Valencia. Wilcox again suffered relegation, in 2004, as Leeds struggled with a large financial burden after failing to qualify for the Champions League, forcing the sale of several high- profile stars. He was released by Leeds in May 2004. Overall, he made 106 appearances for Leeds, scoring 6 goals. =Leicester City= In 2004, Wilcox signed on a free transfer with fellow relegated club Leicester. He initially signed a one-year deal which was extended by another year in the summer of 2005. Wilcox made an excellent start to his Leicester career, but unfortunately picked up a horrific cruciate ligament injury in October 2004. It was feared it would end his season and maybe his career, but he returned in City's 3‚Äì1 win over Millwall on 2 April 2005. He scored once for Leicester, in a 3‚Äì2 win over Sheffield United in September 2004. =Blackpool= On 28 January 2006, Wilcox joined Blackpool on a free transfer following a two-month spell on loan to the club,http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/players_profiles/W/WilcoxJM.php after his old Blackburn teammate Simon Grayson requested Wilcox join the club to help save them from relegation. He was released at the end of the season after a disagreement with other staff members. International career Wilcox won his first England cap in a 3‚Äì0 win over Hungary in 1996. After a great debut, in which he hit the bar in the first minute, many tipped him to make the final squad for Euro 96; however, he was cut from the final squad of 22 players in what Terry Venables described as one of the toughest decisions of his career. He went on to play against France and Argentina: these turned out to be his only other full caps.http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/W/Jason- Wilcox Wilcox made the provisional squad for Euro 2000 but was replaced by Gareth Barry after an injury. He also made two appearances for the B team, against Chile and Hong Kong. Personal life Wilcox is a black belt in judo and even represented England before he became a professional footballer. When he reached the age of seventeen he was made to choose between the two sports, only being able to fully commit himself to one of them as a potential career path. After retiring from football, Wilcox took some time out from the game before joining the commentary staff of BBC Radio Lancashire for a year, as well as having his own weekly column in the Lancashire Telegraph.

Friend () is a 2001 South Korean action film written and directed by Kwak Kyung-taek. Upon its release, it became the highest-grossing South Korean movie of all time. Its record was surpassed in 2003 by Silmido. This film is the director's experiences with his friends, a semi-autobiography set in his hometown, Busan, and the actors speak with a strongly accented Busan dialect. The film changed the public images of Jang Dong-gun and Yu Oh-seong; previously, Jang had been famous for romantic comedies and Yu had appeared in movies with mostly cult interest. Plot The film follows the lives of four childhood friends: Joon-seok, the leader of the group whose father is a powerful mob boss; Dong-su, whose father is an undertaker; class clown Jung- ho; and Sang-taek, who was an exemplary student. As children, they play together and sell sexually explicit pictures. In high school, they become smitten with the lead singer of a girl band their age. Joon-seok invites the band to a party at his house, where Sang-taek receives his first kiss from the lead singer, Jin-sook. In school, Joon-seok and Dong-su get in trouble after a confrontation with a teacher; they apologize and only receive a light suspension. During an outing to the movies, Sang-taek catches the eye of a school kid he had picked a fight with earlier. Joon-seok and Dong-su fend off a whole rival school while Jung-ho protects Sang-taek. Dong-su smashes the school's glass cases with its awards and trophies and drops out of school. After graduation, Sang-taek and Jung-ho go to college but the others do not. A few years later, Sang-taek and Jung-ho return to find Joon-seok married to Jin-sook. He is suffering withdrawal symptoms and is abusive towards his wife as a result of being addicted to philopon. Later, he recovers from his addiction, divorces his wife, and mourns his father's death. He assumes his father's role as a crime lord, working under Hyung-doo. Dong-su becomes a mobster with a rival organization, led by Sang-gon. Joon-seok, Sang-taek, and Jung-ho remain close, drinking, singing karaoke, and eating galbi together. After Dong-su causes Joon-seok's boss to be imprisoned, a rogue assassination attempt, headed by Doruko, is led against Dong-su without Joon-seok's knowledge. The attack fails, and in retaliation, Dong-su mounts an attack on Joon-seok's fishing facilities, during which many of Joon-seok's men, including Doruko, are killed. Joon-seok talks to Dong-su and asks if he would like to accompany him to see Sang-taek off to America. Dong-su says no. He asks Dong-su to leave for Hawaii until the situation returns to normal, but Dong-su refuses, telling Joon-seok that he should be the one to go. After Joon-seok leaves their meeting, Dong-su reflects and asks one of his men to take him to the airport. However, outside his car, he is stabbed to death. A few years later, Sang-taek returns to South Korea upon finishing his study abroad. Jung-ho explains that Joon-seok's gang sent him into hiding abroad. After two years, he was unable to stand the hiding any longer. He was caught in a foreign bar, found with severe self-inflicted wounds. Joon-seok stood trial for Dong-su's murder and pleaded guilty to ordering Dong-su's death. Sang-taek visits Joon-seok in prison, and the two talk like old friends. Sang- taek asks why he pleaded guilty in court. Joon-seok simply replies, \\"Embarrassment. Me and Dong-su are mobsters. Mobsters shouldn't be embarrassed.\\" Sang-taek and Joon-seok part ways, with Sang-taek promising to visit every month. The film ends with Joon-seok walking to his fate in prison life, and Sang-taek reflecting on the past when they were all children, when they were all good friends.

On 29 November 1962, NK Osijek juniors took part in the Yugoslav Republic Day tournament in Belgrade where 16-year-old Dujkoviƒá impressed so much that powerhouse Red Star Belgrade immediately offered a move to their youth system. He accepted right away and only went home to pick up personal belongings. At Red Star he became part of a new batch of up-and-coming players along with Jovan Aƒáimoviƒá, Stanislav Karasi, Dragan D≈æajiƒá, Trifke Mihajloviƒá under coach Miljan Miljaniƒá. Dujkoviƒá made his first team debut on 4 June 1964 in a last week tie of the 1963/64 season versus OFK Beograd. While at Red Star he played in the 1971 European Champions Cup semi-final and earned four appearances in Yugoslavia national football team. In 1974, Dujkoviƒá moved to Real Oviedo, spending three seasons with the Spanish outfit. He returned to Yugoslav First League in 1977, joining newly promoted NK Osijek and staying with the club for three seasons. Following the conclusion to 1979/80 campaign, at the end of which NK Osijek got relegated, Dujkoviƒá made the switch to Galenika Zemun, another second league side, and helped it gain promotion in 1981/82 season. He would not play top flight football again, though, as he promptly retired in the summer of 1982. Managing career Dujkoviƒá's foray into coaching started with the same club he ended his playing days in: Galenika. He was part of their coaching staff during 1982/83 season, which the team finished dead last and got relegated again. =Galenika= Dujkoviƒá's first head coaching job came in 1983 at Galenika. He led the team to some respectable results in Yugoslav Second League for a couple of seasons, but never gained promotion. In 1987, he accepted an offer from Red Star Belgrade to become the goalkeepers' coach on their staff. For the next 5 years Dujkoviƒá worked under various head coaches, with the exception of one season that he spent assisting Gojko Zec in United Arab Emirates. Dujkoviƒá was on the Red Star coaching staff when the team won the European Cup in 1991. =Venezuela= Dujkoviƒá would wait until 1992 for his next head coaching job. He was recommended to the Venezuelan Football Federation by Vladica Popoviƒá and Du≈°an Maroviƒá both of whom had playing stints in the country. That, coupled with his knowledge of Spanish made Dujkoviƒá the head coach of Venezuela national football team where he spent three years. Taking over the team of modest expectations, his biggest claims to success might be that under his guidance Venezuela avoided last place in Copa Am√©rica for the first time in a very long period or that they jumped 29 places on the FIFA list. =Myanmar and a return to Venezuela= Next came the head coaching role at Myanmar's national football team. Dujkoviƒá qualified them for Asian Games, but eventually quit due to Myanmar's turbulent relationship with FIFA. He returned to Venezuela to recently established Atl√©tico Zulia club side from Maracaibo and got the coach of the year honours. Afterwards, Dujkoviƒá coached Universidad de Los Andes from M√©rida and later their cross-town rivals Estudiantes. In 2000, he was included on the FR Yugoslavia's coaching staff for Euro 2000 under head coach Vujadin Bo≈°kov. =Rwanda= Dujkoviƒá became the coach of the Rwandan football team in late 2001. Rwandan Football Federation sought assistance in their search for a coach from Serbia-Montenegro FA, which in turn recommended Dujkoviƒá. Emerging from the horrors of genocide, football provided a welcome distraction for the people of Rwanda. The team won 7 of its first 18 matches under Dujkoviƒá's guidance. He soon gained international acclaim when he led Rwanda into the African Cup of Nations for the first time. Ironically, Rwanda qualified at the expense of Ghana ‚Äì a nation whose national team he would soon take over and lead to 2006 World Cup ‚Äì in a memorable qualifier in Kigali on 6 July 2003. At the final tournament in Tunisia in January 2004, Rwanda, among the smallest ever to qualify, came within minutes of progressing from the group and entering quarterfinals. Dujkoviƒá's contract with Rwanda expired in mid-2004 and he left after failing to agree to a new contract with the Rwandan FA. =Ghana= In September 2004, the Portuguese-born Mariano Barreto quit the Ghana national football team to manage CS Mar√≠timo in his native country. A long 3-month search for his replacement followed and it included various candidates (Philippe Troussier among many others). Finally by late November, the job was offered to Dujkoviƒá who accepted it in mid-December. He thus took over the helm of the squad featuring a much greater depth of talent than Rwanda ‚Äì not to mention the few established stars playing in top European clubs like Sammy Kuffour, Stephen Appiah and Michael Essien. Naturally, the expectations were also sizable and he was entrusted with the task of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He successfully achieved it, leading the side to their first ever FIFA World Cup appearance. The same qualifying tournament was also the qualification for the 2006 African Cup of Nations in Egypt. Dujkoviƒá faced a lot of opposition throughout his tenure in Ghana. Many wanted to see a domestic coach lead the national team. Calls for his sacking particularly intensified in January 2006 after an indifferent display at the 2006 African Cup of Nations where Ghana got drawn in a fairly difficult group with Nigeria, Senegal and Zimbabwe.Dujkoviƒá lost the plot, modernghana.com, 25 January 2006. After losing to Nigeria and defeating Senegal, Ghana faced a deciding match against the seeming minnows of the group Zimbabwe who up to that point failed to collect a single point from first two matches. A win would assure progression for Ghana, but they lost 1-2 and failed to move to the second round. On 12 June 2006 at AWD-Arena in Hanover, Dujkoviƒá led Ghana in its first ever World Cup match. Unfortunately, it ended unhappily for his team as Italy beat them easily 2-0. The Black Stars went into their next match versus Czech Republic knowing a loss would probably mean elimination. In a very entertaining match, Ghana managed a famous 2-0 win despite missing several clear-cut scoring chances as well as failing to convert a penalty shot. Third game pitted Dujkoviƒá's team against the United States and they delivered once more, beating the Americans 2-1 and qualifying for the Round of 16 where Brazil awaited. Although powerhouse Brazil seemingly dispatched of them easily (3-0), Ghana put in a feisty display. The match contained some controversy too, as crucial second Brazilian goal right before halftime came from an offside that was not given. Dujkoviƒá took his protest to the referee ƒΩubo≈° Micheƒæ and reportedly told him sarcastically that he should put on a Brazilian jersey. Micheƒæ responded by issuing a red card, meaning that Dujkoviƒá was not on the sideline for the remainder of the game. Though his contract with Ghana had him committed until December 2006, Dujkoviƒá resigned his post on 16 July 2006 citing health problems. Dujkoviƒá was heavily criticised by the Ghanaian media, who believed that he had ulterior motives for resigning before the expiration of his contract. Dujkoviƒá in turn, blamed the media for putting unmerited stress and pressure on him, a move that didn't go down well with the Ghanaian public. Not long after he left the Ghanaian team, it was reported that he had signed up with China to coach the Chinese Olympic Soccer Team. =China Olympic team= On October 10, 2006, Dujkoviƒá was appointed coach of China national under-23 football team also known as China's Olympic team.Dujkoviƒá new coach for China's Olympic soccer team His main task was preparing the team for the 2008 Olympic Games on home soil for which the Chinese FA set the ambitious goal of reaching the semifinals. In late 2006, Dujkoviƒá led the team in 2006 Asian Games where they progressed out of the group on top before losing a quarterfinal thriller to Iran u-23 on penalties. In June 2007, following a string of bad results for China's senior national team led by Zhu Guanghu, Chinese media started calling for Dujkoviƒá to take over the coaching duties of the top national side. For his part, Dujkoviƒá expressed interest, but not before 2008 Olympics. He also ruled out coaching two sides at the same time.Dujkoviƒá coy about top China job Still, he did get involved with the senior team in lesser capacity as the 'general coach' after his countryman Vladimir Petroviƒá took over as head coach in September 2007.Dujkoviƒá: A medal is the aim; FIFA.com, 9 July 2008. After reiterating that Olympic medal is the goal in early July 2008,Dujkovic: A medal is the aim; FIFA.com, 9 July 2008. Dujkoviƒá got sacked a week later (and only three weeks before the start of the Olympics) by the Chinese FA.China axe Dujkoviƒá, fifa.com, 17 July 2008. The shocking development came as the culmination of the behind the scenes clashes between two parties. Dujkoviƒá's assistant Yin Tiesheng took over on short notice and led the team in the Olympics.Dujkovic sacked 3 weeks before Games, Shandong on Internet, July 18, 2008 The team drew its first group match of the competition, and lost the remaining two, failing to progress out of the group. =Serbia under-21 team= On 15 July 2009, Dujkoviƒá was named as the head coach of Serbia national under-21 football team.Dujkoviƒá selektor mlade selekcije, b92.net, 15 July 2009. He took over the team that has had plenty of success in the years prior to his arrival and was now looking to continue down the same path. His immediate goal was qualifying for the 2011 European Under-21 Championship in Denmark. His competitive debut took place on September 5, 2009 at home versus Slovakia, and it ended with Serbia losing 1-2 on a goal in injury time. Though two wins followed (away at Norway and home versus minnows Cyprus), many criticized the overall play of Dujkoviƒá's team. After the away 3-1 loss to traditional rivals Croatia many criticized his player selection as well. As the long qualifying break commenced in November 2009, Dujkoviƒá's team was in third spot with 9 points, behind Croatia (12) and Slovakia (10). In early February 2010, Nigeria Football Association reportedly made preliminary contact with Dujkoviƒá about taking over the head coaching duties at their national team. According to what Dujkoviƒá told Serbian press, the potential deal included coaching Nigeria for four months conclusive with the 2010 World Cup.Dujkoviƒá za MONDO: Da, zvala me je Nigerija!, mondo.rs, 8 February 2010. Furthermore, he publicly expressed interest in the job despite being under contract with Serbian FA (FSS), hoping to be allowed to perform two jobs simultaneously since Serbia u-21 didn't resume playing competitive matches again until August 2010. FSS president Tomislav Karad≈æiƒá said Dujkoviƒá would be released from his contract without penalties should he request so, but ruled out allowing him to perform two jobs at the same time.FSS: \\"Dujkoviƒá mora da se odluƒçi\\", b92.net; 10 February 2010. The Nigerian job eventually went to Lars Lagerb√§ck. On 11 August 2010, qualifying resumed for Serbia with a match away at Slovakia, the first of three must-wins if qualification was to be secured. Playing without Ivan Obradoviƒá and Raƒáa Petroviƒá who were made available to Radomir Antiƒá's full squad that played a friendly match versus Greece the same day, and without Adem Ljajiƒá and Danijel Aleksiƒá, neither of whom Dujkoviƒá called up, reasoning he needed players who \\"had more playing time in the recent period and had more experience\\". His team had a very poor outing, losing 1-2 and thus relinquishing any chance of qualifying for the 2011 European u-21 Championship.Oƒçajni \\"orliƒái\\" zaslu≈æeno ne idu u Dansku, mondo.rs, 11 August 2010. One day after losing to Slovakia, Dujkoviƒá handed in his resignation and did not lead the team in the remaining two matches of the qualifying. The job went to Tomislav Siviƒá who finished out the two meaningless qualifiers.Dujkoviƒá: Logiƒçno je da podnesem ostavku, Blic.rs, 12 August 2010. =Syria= In mid-October 2010, Dujkoviƒá was named the new head coach of the Syrian national team,Ratomir Dujkoviƒá na klupi Sirije, Blic.rs, 11 October 2010. thus becoming the fourth Serb, after Dragoslav Popoviƒá, Dragoslav Srijoviƒá and Miloslav Radivojeviƒá, to lead the Syrian football squad. On 19 December 2010, two months after getting hired, Dujkoviƒá was fired by the Syrian FA for \\"not returning from vacation on the agreed upon date\\".Fudbalski savez Sirije otpustio Ratomira Dujkoviƒáa, Blic.rs, 19 December 2010. Dujkoviƒá claimed to the Serbian press that he was not fired, but rather that he quit over Syrian FA's decision not to allow him to bring his own assistant coaches.Dujkoviƒá: Nisam smenjen u Siriji, ja sam njima dao otkaz, Blic.rs; 21 December 2010. In April 2014 it was announced that Dujkoviƒá was part of an 8-man shortlist to replace Eric Nshimiyimana as Rwanda manager.

It is a series of six deep blue lakes separated by natural dams made of travertine, a mineral deposit. The lakes are situated in the Hindu Kush mountains at approximately 3000 m of elevation, west of the famous Buddhas of Bamiyan. They were created by the carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults and fractures to deposit calcium carbonate precipitate in the form of travertine walls that today store the water of these lakes. Band-e Amir is one of the few rare natural lakes in the world which are created by travertine systems. The site of Band-e Amir has been described as Afghanistan's Grand Canyon, and draws thousands of tourists a year. The river is part of the system of the Balkh River. History The name Band-e Amir literally means \\"Commander's Dam\\" which is believed by some to be a reference to Ali, the fourth Caliph of the Muslims. The area is dominated by ethnic Hazaras, who are estimated to make up about 10 percent of Afghanistan's population. In her 1970 guide to Afghanistan, Nancy Dupree wrote that a full description about Band-e Amir would \\"rob the uninitiated of the wonder and amazement it produces on all who gaze upon it\\". Parts of the 1975 Bollywood film Dharmatma, with Feroz Khan and Hema Malini, were filmed at the Band-e Amir National Park. In 2004, Band-e Amir was submitted for recognition as a World Heritage site.Band-E-Amir - canesecco World Heritage Centre. Submitted on 2004-09-08. Retrieved on 2008-07-15 from https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1946/. Efforts to make Band-e Amir a national park started in the 1970s, but were then put on hold due to the wars. In April 2009, Band-e Amir was finally declared Afghanistan's first national park.Leithead, Alastair (2008-07-15). Getting tourists to Afghanistan's 'Grand Canyon'. BBC News. Retrieved on 2008-07-15 from http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7506146.stm. As of 2013, about 6,000 local tourists visit the Band-e Amir National Park every year. The area is protected by a small number of park rangers.  Geography  Band-e Amir National Park as seen from space Band-e Amir is situated at approximately 75 km to the north-west of the ancient city of Bamyan, close to the town of Yakawlang. Together with Bamyan Valley, they are the heart of Afghanistan's tourism, attracting thousands of tourists every year and from every corner of the world. The six constituent lakes of Band-e Amir are: *Band-e Gholaman (Lake of the slaves) *Band-e Qambar (Lake of Caliph Ali's slave) *Band-e Haibat (Lake of grandiose) *Band-e Panir (Lake of cheese) *Band-e Pudina (Lake of wild mint) *Band-e Zulfiqar (Lake of the sword of Ali) Band-e Haibat is the biggest and the deepest of the six, with an average depth of approximately 150 metres, as estimated by the Provincial Reconstruction Team diving team from New Zealand. The white travertine dams created by fault lines, which are prevalent in the Band-e Amir Valley, form the barriers between the lakes. Another comparable lake is Band-e Azhdahar (The Dragon), located a few kilometres southeast of the town of Bamyan, which has also been created as a result of carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults underground and depositing calcium carbonate precipitate to form the travertine walls of Band-e Amir. The Band-e Amir lakes are primarily a late spring and summertime tourism destination, as the high elevation central Hazarajat region of Afghanistan is extremely cold in winter, with temperatures reaching as low as -20C.

Grazing of livestock, collection of shrubs for fuel and winter fodder and rain-fed farming is still widely practiced within the park boundary. Although the illegal hunting of birds and a few mammals living in the park is formally prohibited by the park office, there is no current data to evaluate the status of wildlife and biodiversity. After the formal establishment of the park in 2009, a park office with a park warden and a group of rangers was installed to manage the conservation and protection of park natural resources. Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is the only non- government organization with an office in the park. WCS supports park staff and works with the local community to promote conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Ecotourism is expected to decrease local economic dependency on the park's natural resources. Tourists visit Band-e-Amir primarily in the summer months when the weather is warm. A poor local economy and limited outside investment have hampered efforts to attract winter tourism.

It produces lambics, a style of Belgian ale that uses raw wheat and wild yeast. History The history of Lindemans Brewery began in 1822 when the brewery was founded on a small farm in Vlezenbeek. The brewery's patriarch was Frans Lindemans, the brother of the then-bailiff of Gaasbeek. In 1930, due to the growing success of the brewery, the agricultural activity was stopped definitively to focus on the brewing of Kriek and Gueuze. They produced their first Faro in 1978. Shortly after, in 1980 the brewery started its production of Framboise. Consequently, in 1986 and 1987, Lindemans added Cassis and Pecheresse to its assortment. Finally, in 2005, Apple was the last beer to be introduced. The brewery, to this day, is still a family company, ran by brothers Nestor and Rene for a long time, before their sons, Dirk and Geert, took over the business, each having a 50% interest in the company. Lindemans Brewery in Vlezenbeek Production Lindemans brews its lambic according to the method of spontaneous fermentation. This lambic is then used as the base for all of the fruit beers. In 25 years, the production grew from 5.000 to 50.000 hectoliters. Over that span, the brewery expanded multiple times. In 1991 a new brewhouse was built next to the old one to increase capacity. In 2013 works for a new expansion, with a new bottling plant, started. Today, the brewery brews 85.000 hectoliters per year. 60.000 hectoliters of this amount is lambic, the base to which fruit juices are added. Each year 6.000 hectoliters of Lindemans Faro are produced, representing 7,5% of the entire production. Beers =Faro= Framboise and P√™cheresse bottles Lindemans Faro is a lambic beer. The first Lindemans Faro was brewed in 1978, when the beverage was becoming popular again. At 4% ABV, it is considered a light beer. It is available in 250 ml, 375 ml and 750 ml bottles. =Fruit beers= Lindemans varieties include Lambic Framboise (raspberry), Kriek (sour cherry), P√™cheresse (peach), Cassis (blackcurrant), and Pomme (apple). Because of the limited availability of sour cherries from Schaerbeek, the traditional ingredient for kriek, Lindemans Kriek is made using unsweetened cherry juice which is added to a mixture of lambics of different ages. The resulting beer is described as less sour and more fruity. It contains 2.5% ABV.

Garden State Canoeing, Seneca Press, 2002. Course Originally a stream, its course now includes man-made lakes created by dams built in the 19th and 20th centuries: Deans Pond (South Brunswick), Davidsons Mill Pond (South Brunswick), Farrington Lake (South Brunswick, North Brunswick and East Brunswick), Mill Pond (Milltown), and Westons Mill Pond (Milltown, East Brunswick, North Brunswick and New Brunswick). Its lowest section, near the Raritan River, is tidal; it hosts marine wildlife and is regarded as a coastal area. Its drainage basin, the Lawrence Brook watershed, is a area, identified by the USGS code HUC 02030105130. At the stretch at Weston's Mill Pond, Lawrence Brook crosses Rutgers University's Cook Campus, along the vegetable research farm, the equine research farm, Rutgers Gardens, and Helyar forest. Lawrence Brook is a wildlife corridor, a bird migration area and a highly sensitive body of water. Power boats, except with an electric motor, are not permitted on the brook. History *This stream was called Piscopeek by the Unami Lenni Lenape Indians. Its current name comes from Mr.Thomas Lawrence, a New York City baker, who acquired its surrounding land in the 17th century.Indian bill of sale, Trenton Museum Some historical maps show the spelling Lawrence's Brook. *In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Farrington Lake area served as a resort area, with a trolley line running from New Brunswick through Milltown then turning south to eventually end at the State Fair Grounds in Trenton. The lake (named for a mayor of New Brunswick who died during WWI) was formed by a dam built above a lower working dam that powered a snuff mill built in the mid 19th century.

She is the lead anchor of BBC Two's news and current affairs programme Newsnight, and also covers elections for the BBC in UK, US and Europe. Early life and education Maitlis was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada to British Jewish parents; her paternal grandmother was a Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany. She is the daughter of Professor Peter Maitlis FRS, Emeritus Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Sheffield, and Marion Maitlis, a psychotherapist. Maitlis was brought up in Sheffield, Yorkshire, and was educated at the King Edward VII School and Queens' College, Cambridge. She speaks fluent Spanish, Italian and French, as well as some Mandarin.\\"'Flirtation, seduction and betrayal'\\" ‚Äì interview, The Guardian, 6 March 2006.

Career Maitlis initially wanted to work as a director, prompted by her love for drama, but instead went into radio broadcasting. Prior to working in news, she was a documentary maker in Cambodia and China. She worked for the NBC network and was based in Hong Kong. She spent six years in Hong Kong with TVB News and NBC Asia, initially as a business reporter creating documentaries, and then as a presenter in Hong Kong covering the collapse of the tiger economies in 1997.\\"Emily Maitlis\\" ‚Äì profile, \\"BBC Newsnight\\", 30 March 2006.

Retrieved 13 August 2010. She then moved to Sky News in the UK as a business correspondent, and then to BBC London News when the programme was relaunched in 2001. During 2005, Maitlis appeared as the question-master on the game show The National Lottery: Come And Have A Go. She was a regular presenter on BBC News Channel for a decade between 2006 and 2016, alongside Ben Brown and Jon Sopel. She also presented BBC Breakfast and from May 2006 until July 2007 presented STORYFix on BBC News, a light-hearted look at the week's news set to up-beat music. In July 2007, Maitlis was appointed as a contributing editor to The Spectator magazine, an unpaid post. This had been approved by her immediate manager, the head of BBC Television News Peter Horrocks, but the decision was subsequently overturned by his superior, the BBC News director Helen Boaden.Stephen Brook \\"BBC criticised for 'Vicky Pollard management'\\", The Guardian, 11 July 2007. Retrieved 14 July 2007. In 2012, Maitlis presented the US 2012 election coverage on BBC One and the BBC News Channel alongside David Dimbleby, when incumbent US President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were fighting for the presidency of the US. In 2016, she presented a news discussion programme called This Week's World on BBC Two, late afternoon on Saturdays. Maitlis is one of the main presenters of Newsnight on BBC Two, alongside Kirsty Wark and Emma Barnett. She first joined the programme as a relief presenter in 2006, working her way up to be lead anchor of the programme following the departure of Evan Davis in 2018. After each show, before bed, she answers emails from viewers and in April 2019 published a book Airhead: The Imperfect Art of Making News, describing how television news is produced. In November 2019, Maitlis interviewed the Duke of York, Prince Andrew about his relationship with American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who died in August whilst awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The interview was broadcast on the BBC's Newsnight programme on 16 November 2019. Due in part to the disastrous fallout from Prince Andrew‚Äôs performance during this interview, he later resigned from his Royal duties. As of 2019, Maitlis was amongst the highest paid BBC news and current affairs staff, receiving a salary between ¬£260,000-¬£264,999. In July 2020 campaign group Defund the BBC ran billboards highlighting Maitlis' salary and that of Gary Lineker, with the heading \\"Are you still paying?\\". In February 2020, her interview with Prince Andrew won Interview of the Year and Scoop of the Year awards at the 2020 RTS Television Journalism Awards. Controversies In a Newsnight discussion concerning Brexit on 15 July 2019 it was alleged that Maitlis had been \\"sneering and bullying\\" towards columnist Rod Liddle. Maitlis accused Liddle's columns of containing \\"consistent casual racism week after week\\", asking Liddle if he would describe himself as a racist. An investigation by the BBC Executive Complaints Unit upheld the complaints against her, agreeing that she been \\"persistent and personal\\" in her criticism of Liddle, thus \\"leaving her open [sic] to the charge that she had failed to be even-handed\\" in the discussion between Brexit-supporting Liddle and his anti-Brexit opponent Tom Baldwin. The successful complainant suggested that the broadcast exemplified the way the BBC viewed leave voters, whilst Douglas Murray described the segment as \\"more of a drive-by shooting than an interview\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/sites/default/files/2020-01/Bulletin%20April%20-%20September%2019.pdf On 27 May 2020, the BBC said that Maitlis's introduction to Newsnight the night before, which discussed the allegations that the Prime Minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had contravened lockdown restrictions, \\"did not meet our standards of due impartiality\\". The broadcaster said in a statement: \\"The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output. Ms Maitlis started the show by declaring that Mr Cummings had 'broken the rules'\\". She stood aside as the host of Newsnight on that day after asking to take the night off. On 3 September 2020 a report by the BBC's Editorial Complaints Unit also ruled against Maitlis in the matter, stating Maitlis' comments \\"went beyond an attempt to set out the programme agenda\\" and that the \\"definitive and at times critical nature of the language\\" had \\"placed the presenter closer to one side of the debate\\" and thus \\"did not meet the required standards on accuracy or impartiality\\". Personal life Maitlis is married to investment manager Mark Gwynne, whom she met while working in Hong Kong. Maitlis proposed to her husband while on holiday in Mauritius in 2000.The couple have two children, Milo and Max.\\"My week: Emily Maitlis\\" The Observer, 7 May 2006.

Maitlis's family are Jewish, although she has said that they are \\"not very practising\\". =Stalking= During 2002, it was reported that Maitlis had been stalked for over a decade by a former platonic friend from her time at university, Edward Vines, who would appear at her place of work. He admitted harassing Maitlis, and was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, but released because of the time he had spent on remand. A restraining order was imposed. In September 2016, Vines was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for breach of the restraining order in respect of Maitlis. In January 2018, Vines was jailed for 3 years and 9 months for breaching a restraining order forbidding him to contact Maitlis. He admitted two charges of breaching the restraining order by sending two letters to Maitlis, as well as emails and letters to her mother in 2015. In September 2019, while a prisoner at HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire, he pleaded not guilty to breaching an order restraining him from contacting Maitlis by writing a letter with the intention it be passed to her. That case led to his being sentenced, in February 2020, to a further three years' imprisonment. In a BBC Radio 5 Live interview, Maitlis likened the long-term harassment to having a chronic illness. Awards Maitlis won Broadcast Journalist of the Year at the 2017 London Press Club Awards and the Network Presenter of the Year award at the RTS Television Journalism Awards in 2019 and 2020.

Barnes, Who's Who in Religion (Marquis Who's Who, 1992), p. 170. is a biblical scholar and the Ann and Jay Davis Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Georgia. Friedman was born in Rochester, New York.Barnes, Who's Who in Religion, p. 170. He attended the University of Miami (BA, 1968), the Jewish Theological Seminary (MHL, 1971), and Harvard University (ThM in Hebrew Bible, 1974; ThD in Hebrew Bible and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, 1978). He was the Katzin Professor of Jewish Civilization: Hebrew Bible; Near Eastern Languages and Literature at the University of California, San Diego, from 1994 until 2006, whereupon he joined the faculty of the University of Georgia's Religion Department, where he is currently the Ann and Jay Davis Professor of Jewish Studies. Friedman teaches courses in Hebrew, Bible, and Jewish Studies. He is a winner of numerous awards and honors, including American Council of Learned Societies Fellow. He was a Visiting Fellow at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford; and a Senior Fellow of the American Schools of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. He participated in the City of David Project archaeological excavations of biblical Jerusalem. He is probably most famous for his work Who Wrote the Bible?, which provides an updated analysis of the documentary hypothesis. Origin of the P and the D source Friedman is of the view that the P Source of the Bible was composed during the time of Hezekiah. P for instance ‚Äúemphasizes centralization of religion: one center, one altar, one Tabernacle, one place of sacrifice. Who was the king who began centralization? King Hezekiah.\\" According to Friedman, and others who follow the theories of Julius Wellhausen regarding the formation of Israel's religion, P is the work of the Aaronid priesthood. They are the priests in authority at the central altar ‚Äì not Moses, not Korah, nor any other Levites. Only those descended from Aaron can be priests. Friedman then goes on to say ‚ÄúP always speaks of two distinct groups, the priests and the Levites. Who was the king who formalized the divisions between priests and Levites? King Hezekiah.\\" Chronicles reports explicitly: :‚ÄúHezekiah assigned (Hebrew ◊ô◊¢◊û◊ì) the priests and Levites to divisions ‚Äî each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites. ()‚Äù Friedman writes that the ‚ÄúAaronid priesthood that produced P had opponents, Levites who saw Moses and not Aaron as their model. What was the most blatant reminder of Moses' power that was visible in Judah? The bronze serpent 'Nehushtan'. According to tradition, stated explicitly in E, Moses had made it. It had the power to save people from snakebite. Who was the king who smashed the Nehushtan? Hezekiah.‚Äù Friedman has also proposed that the prophet Jeremiah, working together with his scribe Baruch, was also the person that is the D-source, the Deuteronomist, who wrote/rewrote the books of Deuteronomy, Jozua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. In his book \\"Who wrote the Bible\\" he gives supporting evidence pointing towards this identification and also notes that in the Talmud Jeremiah was already seen as the author of the book of Kings. In his view this part of the Bible must be seen as one major theological history, which centers on the covenant between the Jews and Yahweh promising eternal prosperity for Isra√´l but demanding that they should worship only Yahweh. In a long cycle of infidelity-defeat-repentance-forgiveness the Jewish history is written. According to him the history first ended with King Josiah as the ultimate god-fearing king and a was later rewritten after the fall of the kingdom in 586 BE, putting the blame on the evil done under Manasseh, writing \\"No king ever arose like Josiah.... But Yahweh did not turn back from his great fury which burned against Judah over all the things in which Manasseh had angered him\\" (2 Kings 23:25-26). Writings * Who Wrote the Bible?

He asserts, following Yehezkel Kaufmann, that the Priestly source was written earlier than commonly accepted, during the reign of King Hezekiah (715‚Äì687 BCE). Though he identified the Deuteronomist as either the prophet Jeremiah, or the latter's scribe, Baruch ben Neriah (or both, working together) in the first edition of the book, he recanted this statement in the second edition. * The Disappearance of God: A Divine Mystery (Little, Brown and Company) (October 1, 1995) * The Hidden Face of God (Harper San Francisco) (December 13, 1996) * The Hidden Book in the Bible (Harper San Francisco) (September 1, 1999) : Concerns the Jahwist (J) source. * Commentary on the Torah (Harper San Francisco) (April 1, 2003) * The Bible with Sources Revealed (Harper San Francisco) (December 1, 2003) : A translation of the Pentateuch into English with the different sources highlighted in different font styles and colours * The Bible Now, with Shawna Dolansky (Oxford University Press) (July 1, 2011) * The Exodus (HarperOne) (September 12, 2017) : Presents a case for a historical Exodus, but of the Levites only.

It is the oldest part of the city. It is bounded by Rideau Street to the south, the Ottawa River to the west and north and the Rideau River to the east.http://www.lowertown-basseville.ca/association.html It includes the commercial Byward Market area in the south-western part, and is predominantly residential in the north and east. It was historically French Canadian and Irish (as opposed to English and Scottish Upper Town, a term no longer in use) and is to this day home to many Franco-Ontarian families, businesses and institutions. Public facilities * Lowertown Pool - a public in-ground swimming pool with rope & diving board. Sauna & change rooms on-site. Ample free parking available. Population The total population of Lower Town (including Porter Island), according to the Canada 2011 Census, is 12,274 Population calculated by combining Census Tracts 5050055.00 and 5050056.00 with Dissemination Areas 35061789, 35060251, 35061790, 35061792, 35061794, 35061795, 35061796, 35061797, 35061798, 35061020, 35061788 and Census Block 3506134702 =Ethnic diversity= According to the City of Ottawa website, there are roughly 4180 native English-speakers in Lowertown, 3530 Francophones, and 2235 with other mother tongues. Lower Town is home to a wide variety of immigrants and visible minorities, of which there are 2495. Lowertown's population is rather diverse. Its main stretch along Rideau Street is very bustling and includes many African, Asian, South Asian, Caribbean, and Lebanese businesses, a large grocery store, the Rideau Branch of the Ottawa Public Library, and an Orthodox Jewish synagogue. Modern Urbanization As part of the Greber Plan for Ottawa, new parkways, roads and bridges were constructed in the post-war period as a plan for urban renewal and \\"improvement\\" of Ottawa. This period saw major upheaval in the area as dozens of city blocks and hundreds of historic homes were systematically demolished to make way for expanded roads and new development. However, while the redevelopment was done in Lower Town, neighbouring areas opposed the plans, leaving the current incomplete solution to traffic through the area, heavy truck traffic, and poor urban streetscape for Lowertown residents to cope with. =King Edward Avenue= Today, King Edward Avenue is a six lane main road running north‚Äìsouth through the centre of the neighbourhood. It is connected on its north to the MacDonald Cartier Bridge, a main connection with Gatineau, Quebec, which leads to heavy traffic travelling to and from Gatineau through the area. The traffic exits Lower Town either to the east along St. Patrick or to the south along Rideau and Nicholas to the 417 highway, as south of Rideau, King Edward is a four-lane (and further south, two-lane) road through the Sandy Hill residential neighbourhood with no heavy truck traffic allowed. The street is so large and so busy that it exists as a major barrier between the east and west halves of Lowertown. Since it is the main truck route between Ottawa and Gatineau there are large numbers of tractor trailers travelling through the core of Ottawa daily, along with tens of thousands of commuters in cars. It is one of the highest accident sites in Ottawa. The road from the bridge was intended to connect to a new Vanier Parkway to the north of the neighbourhood, across Green Island and Maple Island. This connector was never built because of political opposition, and instead St. Patrick Street east of King Edward was built into a major four-lane thoroughfare cutting through the neighbourhood. The end of the connector from the bridge instead connects to King Edward at a sharp turn where the connector would have continued directly to the east. King Edward was itself rebuilt into a six-lane major thoroughfare from Sussex Drive to Rideau Street, and the plan was to continue the six-lane through Sandy Hill to connect to the Queensway (417) highway. This also was never built. =Rideau Street= 1845 painting of Sappers Bridge the Rideau Canal and Lower Town by Thomas Burrowes Rideau Street has had its share of major development and redevelopment spanning over three decades. Prior to the typical appearance of shopping malls, the characteristic sign of modern suburbanization commonly seen as North American cities increase in size and population, Rideau Street west of King Edward was a popular shopping area of Ottawa. The Byward Market, to the north of Rideau Street has consistently thrived throughout ongoing development in surrounding areas. To the south, the Rideau Centre development, a four-level shopping centre, began construction in 1981 continuing through 1982 and upon completion, provided a shopping mall atmosphere upon its official opening on March 16, 1983, as retailers moved inside.http://webcast.ottawa.ca/plan/All_Image%20Referencing_Site%20Plan%20Application_Image%20Reference_Rideau%20Centre%20Planning%20Rationale.PDF As part of the construction, the section of Rideau Street between Sussex Drive & Dalhousie Street was turned into a major bus interchange, which would undergo many major changes in the decades to come, seeing the originally constructed enclosed bus shelters replaced for covered shelters in the 1990s. Further development began once a 230,000 ft expansion of the Rideau Centre was undertaken by Cadillac Fairview on September 26, 2013.https://www.cadillacfairview.com/en_CA/news/rideau-centre- launches-360-million-redevelopment-project.html The transit shelters underwent another major change during this time, including their relocation and modernization, as construction of Rideau Station, one of 13 stops announced as part of O-Train Line 1, named Confederation Line, began in August 2013, as part of Ottawa's existing light-rail system built and operated by OC Transpo.https://www.octranspo.com/ready4rail/expanding_o_train_servicehttp://www.ligneconfederationline.ca/wp- content/uploads/2015/01/Final- Confederation_Line_Look_Ahead_2015_EN.pdfhttps://ottawacitizen.com/business/local- business/architect-behind-massive-rideau-centre-remodelling-says-it-was-all- about-creating-breathing-room See also *List of Ottawa neighbourhoods *Rideau Street External links *Bytown.net article 'Evolution of an Ottawa Neighbourhood' *Lowertown Community Association *Lowertown history: Virtual Museum of Canada Exhibit References ;Bibliography * Category:Neighbourhoods in Ottawa Category:Historic districts in Canada Category:Historic Jewish communities in Canada ","title":"Lower Town"},{"id":"2995026","text":"Dorrington Lane is a hamlet near the village of Woore in northeast Shropshire, England.

Club career Dodgin was born in Wardley, Gateshead, and was the son of footballer Bill Dodgin Sr. He began his career as an amateur, before signing for Southampton, whom his father managed. When Dodgin Sr. moved to Fulham in 1949, his son followed him there, although he still had to wait two years before making his debut in December 1951, against Preston North End at left back. He soon switched to right back, before Fulham were relegated to the Second Division. Feeling the pressure from the fans (who questioned whether he would have been picked, were his father not manager), Dodgin transferred to Arsenal for a fee of ¬£4,000 in December 1952, having played 35 League matches for the Cottagers. By now, he was a centre half, and after a spell in the reserves he made his debut against Bolton Wanderers on 15 April 1953. Arsenal won the old First Division in 1952‚Äì53 but the Bolton game was his only contribution to that success. After the departure of regular centre half Ray Daniel to Sunderland that summer, Dodgin became first choice at the back for Arsenal, missing only three matches that season. However, despite his height, Dodgin was a rather cumbersome defender, and could not live up to the performances of his predecessor. He was dropped at the start of 1954‚Äì55 in favour of Jim Fotheringham. He returned in 1956‚Äì57 and was a regular in the side for the next four seasons. All through this time, Arsenal were going through a barren patch, and apart from a third-place finish in 1958‚Äì59, they were never close to winning a trophy. In total he played 208 matches for Arsenal, scoring only one goal. Dodgin was given a free transfer in March 1961 and returned to his old club Fulham. However, he broke his leg in a match against Aston Villa in 1962 and the injury effectively ended his career; he played only seven more games. International career Although Dodgin played for and captained England at under-23 level, he never appeared for the full international team. Management career After retiring from the game, Dodgin became a coach, first at Millwall, then at Queens Park Rangers, where the club had its 1967 League Cup win. He became QPR's caretaker manager in August 1968 before leaving the club in November of that year. During his tenure at Loftus Road, he presided over the club's worst start in its history, a run of 12 games without a win. He then took the manager's job at Fulham in December 1968. Although the club were relegated from the First Division to the Third in successive seasons, Dodgin stayed with the club and they were promoted to the Second Division in 1971. However, Fulham struggled to stay afloat in the Second Division, and despite avoiding relegation in 1972 he resigned. Dodgin later managed Northampton Town and Brentford, winning promotion from the Fourth Division with both clubs. He then managed Northampton Town for a second, less successful spell and finally Woking before retiring. He died after a long battle with Alzheimers in 2000, aged 68.

He is the son of Jos√© Luis Mil√° Sagnier, count of Montseny; younger brother of Mercedes Mil√° (also a TV journalist); and married to Sagrario Ruiz de Apodaca (also a TV journalist), with three children. Mil√° obtained his Information Sciences degree in 1978 at the University of Barcelona. His career started as a sports journalist, working as an editor for the newspaper Sport. From 1986 onwards, he started to collaborate on various Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola game shows. Between 1988 and '89, he lived in London and worked for Screensport. After that he returned to Spain and kept working at the Sant Cugat TVE center in the sports area. In 1994, Mil√° moved to Madrid to anchor the newly created news broadcasts on TVE2, La 2 Noticias, which he headed until 2003. These broadcasts had a fresh style and were generally perceived to be more independent and less government-biased than those of the Telediario on TVE1, and both Mil√° and the program received many awards. From September 2003 to September 2004, Mil√° was sent to Washington, D.C., as an adjunct foreign correspondent, accompanying his wife, who was the main correspondent there. After that, Carmen Caffarel, new managing director of RTVE (appointed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, then in office) appoints Mil√° to become the main anchor of the nightly edition of TVE1's Telediario, in a bid to overtake the Antena 3 newscasts (anchored by the popular Mat√≠as Prats, who is also a former Telediario presenter) in the ratings, and recover the Telediario's leading position (lost in June 2003). This was finally achieved in 2007. In addition to anchoring the Telediario, Mil√° also hosts the newly created program Tengo una pregunta para usted (\\"I have a question for you\\"), in which the audience on the set asks questions to politicians. This show has achieved the highest ratings ever in Spain for a program of political content. On 31 July 2009, Mil√° anchored his last Telediario before returning to Washington D.C. as a foreign correspondent of TVE. In 2014, he later became TVE's foreign correspondent in Rome, Italy.

It has a harbor protected by breakwaters, being the port city for the productive mining district centering on Copiap√≥ to which it is connected by the first railroad constructed in Chile. Geography and climate Caldera lies about west of Copiap√≥ on the Pacific. The climate is mostly warm and extremely dry, because of its location on the Atacama desert's coast, but the temperatures are moderated by the cooling sea currents. However, lately the climate has become colder due to the climatic change. The commune spans an area of . History In 1687, Englishman Edward Davis reached the Playa Bahia Inglesa south of Caldera. In 1840, William Wheelwright of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company visited the region of Caldera. On his proposal the first railway was created in the year of 1851 from Caldera to Copiap√≥. Its inauguration was on Christmas Day in 1851. Caldera became an important port for the exportation of minerals. The city itself was officially founded on 23 September 1850. The city has been struck by earthquakes and tsunamis several times, the major ones being that of 1868, 1877 and 1922. During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, Caldera Bay outside the city became the site of the Battle of Caldera Bay where torpedo boats loyal to Manuel Balmaceda sunk the rebel ironclad Blanco Encalada. Demographics In 1903, 2,130 people lived in Caldera. According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Caldera had 13,734 inhabitants (7,237 men and 6,497 women). Of these, 13,540 (98.6%) lived in urban areas and 194 (1.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 13.9% (1,673 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Tourist attractions =Urban= * Former Railway Station: The first in Chile, its construction dates back to 1850, with the beginnings of the works for the railway Caldera‚ÄìCopiap√≥, the first railway station in Chile and the third one in South America. It was designed to house a complete train in order to protect valuable minerals brought from Cha√±arcillo. The walls were made of mud and reeds from Guayaquil, with a wooden roof made of Oregon Pine. Inside it had a passenger platform and three load lines, all covered by a large shed 82 meters long by 32 meters wide. * Church of San Vicente de Paul: Built in 1862 in wood with a stone floor and a Gothic wooden tower. Inside there is an image of the Virgin of Sorrows, brought from Peru as spoils of war after the military campaigns during the War of the Pacific. * Cave of Padre Negro: A pilgrimage center built on a rock by the Colombian priest Cris√≥gono Sierra, known locally as Padre Negro (Spanish for \\"Black Father\\"). Inside there are murals by the painter Luis Enrique Cerda. * Municipal Cemetery of Caldera: The first secular cemetery in Chile, it was inaugurated on 20 September 1876. In its historical sector, mausoleums and tombs have cast iron structures made by English craftsmen and Carrara marble tombstones.\\"La Copiap√≥\\" est√° de fiesta en Caldera * Tornini House Museum: a private museum, opened on 5 November 2010. It houses historical artifacts relating to the city-port of Caldera, the Constitutional Revolution (1859), the War of the Pacific (1879-1883), and the Italian immigration in the late nineteenth century. The property was built around 1875 by the Railway Administration Manager, Thomas Smith, and later purchased by Henry B. Beazley, British Consul to Copiap√≥, Caldera and Peru. On 14 October 1907 it was acquired by Bernardo Tornini Capelli, serving for some years as viceconsular seat of the Kingdom of Italy.Casa Tornini, Museo - Centro Cultural: Un espacio para conocer y valorar el patrimonio cultural de Atacama =Rural= * Orbicular Granite Nature Sanctuary: This geological oddity is located 11 km North of Caldera. It is a formation of a small area, about 400 m¬≤, with circular rock mineral scales on granite rocks, giving a peculiar appearance.

The film concerns a group of Ivy League and Hampshire College graduates falling in and out of love in the disco scene of New York City, in the late 1970s and \\"very early 1980s\\". Chlo√´ Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale have the lead roles. The Last Days of Disco is the third film (after Metropolitan (1990) and Barcelona (1994) in what Stillman calls his \\"Doomed-Bourgeois-in-Love series\\". The three films are independent of each other except for the cameo appearances of some common characters. According to Stillman, the idea for Disco was originally conceived after the shooting of Barcelona's disco scenes. In 2000, Stillman published a novelization of the film, titled The Last Days of Disco, with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards. It won the 2014 Prix Fitzgerald Award. The film was released theatrically in the United States on June 12, 1998; its DVD and video releases followed in 1999. The DVD releases eventually went out of print, and the film was widely unavailable for home video purchase until it was picked up by The Criterion Collection and released in a director-approved special edition on August 25, 2009. Along with Metropolitan and Barcelona, a print of The Last Days of Disco resides in the permanent film library of the Museum of Modern Art. Plot In the \\"very early 1980s,\\" Alice Kinnon and Charlotte Pingress, recent Hampshire College graduates, work as poorly-paid readers for a New York City publisher. After work one night, they enter an exclusive disco nightclub where Alice hopes to socialize with Jimmy Steinway, who uses the club to entertain his advertising clients. Barred from bringing clients, Jimmy is eventually kicked out by his friend Des McGrath, a manager at the club whose job is in jeopardy for allowing in Jimmy and his clients. After Jimmy leaves, Alice takes Charlotte's advice to go home with her second choice, Tom Platt. At work the following morning, Charlotte and Alice talk with other editors about how to fast-track their careers. Unable to afford rent on their own, they move in together with a third girl, Holly; despite Alice's reluctance, they settle on a railroad apartment. Returning to the club, Alice is upset to learn Charlotte has designs on Jimmy, and that Tom was separated from a long-term girlfriend when he slept with Alice, but their one-night stand convinced him to return to her. Des begins to pursue Alice. At work, Alice pursues the publication of a book on Buddhism, written by the Dalai Lama's brother, that Charlotte had previously recommended rejecting, and gains the editors' respect. Though it is discovered that the author is not the Dalai Lama's brother, Alice maintains the book is one of the best she has ever read. Charlotte, now dating Jimmy, is openly insecure about Jimmy and Alice's apparent friendliness. Charlotte loudly announces to various friends at the club that Alice has gonorrhea, deducing it when Alice refuses to drink. Charlotte later apologizes, but tells Alice it will make men view her as more accessible. Des does become more interested in being with Alice, and they start dating casually. Alice has dinner with Tom and confronts him about giving her gonorrhea, which he initially denies, but Alice reveals he was her first sexual partner. He admits he also gave her herpes. Josh Neff, a district attorney and friend of Jimmy's who frequently attends the club, asks Alice to lunch to pitch a book. He confesses he is actually interested in Alice, and they go on a real date, where he tells her he is on medication for manic depression. Returning home, Alice discovers Charlotte being taken away in an ambulance after a miscarriage, and being told by Jimmy that he is moving to Barcelona. At the hospital, Charlotte asks Alice if Jimmy ever expressed interest in being with her; when Alice admits that he did, Charlotte reacts with tears and tells her she will be moving out. The nightclub is raided by the police for tax fraud, and Des tries to run away despite Josh's promise to protect him, believing Josh's interest in Alice will cause him to act unfairly. They later discover that disco records were no longer selling and attendance was already down. Alice and Charlotte learn their employer has merged with a larger publishing house and layoffs are to be expected. Some time later, Charlotte, Josh, and Des are seen leaving the unemployment office. Josh announces he is going to Lut√®ce for lunch, treated by Alice, who is celebrating her promotion ‚Äì her book was published after she switched it from non-fiction to self-help). Des and Charlotte discuss how their big personalities are too much for normal personalities like Alice, Josh, and Jimmy. Des says that pairing off monogamously detracts from their glamorous lifestyle, and Charlotte agrees. Taking the subway to Lut√®ce, Alice and Josh discuss their future prospects. As the end credits begin, they break character to dance to \\"Love Train\\", joined by the entire subway station when they arrive at their destination. Cast * Chlo√´ Sevigny as Alice Kinnon: One of two main characters, a quiet and passive but intelligent young woman working as a book editor in Manhattan. She and Charlotte, frequent companions, work for the same publisher and attended a prestigious college together. * Kate Beckinsale as Charlotte Pingress: The other main character, a rather narcissistic and shallow person. She constantly offers \\"advice\\" to Alice and criticizes her lack of sociability. She is outgoing but dominating of those around her. * Chris Eigeman as Des McGrath: A manager at the disco Alice and Charlotte frequent, casually dating Alice at one point. He provides comic relief in many sequences and provides much insight in conversations. He is intelligent but somewhat conniving, and has many hookups with Manhattan women, with a routine of pretending to come out as a homosexual when he has lost interest in them. * Mackenzie Astin as Jimmy Steinway: An ambitious friend of Des who works in advertising. Jimmy has to sneak his way into the disco in costume because the house owner doesn't want \\"those kind of people\\" in the club.

Alice eventually begins a relationship with him, and comes to learn that he suffers from manic depressive disorder. * Robert Sean Leonard as Tom Platt: A charming, wealthy environmental lawyer with whom Alice has a one-night stand. He gained interest in Alice after meeting her at the disco but proved to not be relationship material.

Production =Development and casting= The idea for the film reportedly came to director Stillman after filming the disco scenes in his previous film, Barcelona. Stillman, who had frequented the New York discos in the 1970s and 1980s himself, announced the project soon thereafter, and interest from a handful of film distributors and actors sprouted before the film had even been written. According to Stillman in the 2009 audio commentary for the film, various actors (many of them reportedly \\"big names\\") were interested in the project from its original conception; Ben Affleck was originally looking into playing the role of Des, but Stillman, who had worked with Chris Eigeman before, handed the role over to him instead. Kate Beckinsale, who was living in England at the time, mailed an audition tape to Stillman; he was immediately mesmerized and cast her in the role of Charlotte. The leading role of Alice Kinnon took the longest to cast‚Äîit originally was going to go to an unnamed European actress, but according to Stillman, she resembled co-star Kate Beckinsale \\"too much\\" and also had a non-American accent that caused complications. Winona Ryder was subsequently offered the role through her agent. The call was placed by studio executives on a Monday. The film's editor, Chris Tellefsen, who had previously worked as the editor of Kids, recommended Chlo√´ Sevigny after seeing her performance in that film. Two days after the phone call was placed to Ryder's agent, Sevigny, who had been given the script through her agent, auditioned for the role, and won it. By the time Ryder's agent returned the call, Sevigny had already been cast. =Filming= Principal photography began on August 12, 1997, and ended on October 27, 1997. Filming took place in various New York City locations, and the structure used for the disco was Loews Landmark Theater Loew's Jersey Theatre in Jersey City, New Jersey, that was in the process of being renovated. The filmmakers had to share the location with another film production that took place there beforehand. The other production paid for the red carpeting used in the building, and the rest of the interior was designed and paid for by Stillman's crew. The film's distributor had also pushed the filmmakers to complete the film and get it released before the Miramax disco club film 54, and it was; 54 was released in US cinemas in late August 1998, just two months after the theatrical debut of The Last Days of Disco. Themes Like Stillman's other films, The Last Days of Disco deals with social structure, sexual politics,Richard Brody. The New Yorker, August 8, 2016. \\"The politics of Disco caught on film\\", p. 12. and group dynamics. The relationships that bloom from the club are often expressed through long dialogue sequences, with Stillman's trademark dry humor and \\"sharp lines\\" often blurted, especially by Charlotte and Josh. Release =Box office= The Last Days of Disco was theatrically released on June 12, 1998 in US theaters where it grossed $277,601 on its opening weekend. It went on to make $3 million in North America. With a production budget of $8 million, the film was considered a financial failure, although it was well received by many critics. It was received better than the critically panned release 54, which dealt with the Manhattan disco Studio 54. =Critical reception= The Last Days of Disco received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 73% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. Metacritic gives it a 76 out of 100 rating, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of four and wrote, \\"If [F.] Scott Fitzgerald were to return to life, he would feel at home in a Whit Stillman movie. Stillman listens to how people talk, and knows what it reveals about them\\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin praised Chris Eigeman's performance: \\"Mr. Eigeman makes the filmmaker a perfect mouthpiece who can brood amusingly about anything, no matter how petty. Here he plumbs the psychological subtext of Lady and the Tramp\\". Andrew Sarris, in his review for The New York Observer, wrote, \\"Mr. Stillman's free ticket with the critics for the seemingly magical minimalism of Metropolitan has long since expired. In his future projects, all the charm and buoyancy in the world may not compensate for a lack of structure and bedrock reality\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A- grade; Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, \\"Stillman's gang may be maturing precariously close to middle age, but it's lovely to know the important pleasures of conversation and intellectual discussion endure\\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan praised the \\"exceptional acting ensemble\\" for being \\"successful at capturing the brittle rituals of this specific group of genteel, well-spoken young people on the cusp of adulthood who say things like 'What I was craving was a sentient individual' and 'It's far more complicated and nuanced than that'.\\" =Novelization= The director, Whit Stillman, wrote a novelization of the film published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux under the same title, with the added subtitle \\"...With Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards\\". It won the 2014 Prix Fitzgerald Award.Whit Stillman. Love and Friendship. Listed within promotional material in Stillman's 2016 book.

According to Sevigny in a 2009 audio commentary track for the film, her performance in The Last Days of Disco‚Äîparticularly the upbeat dance sequence finale in the subway‚Äîgot the attention of director Kimberly Peirce, who cast Sevigny in Boys Don't Cry (1999). Sevigny received an Oscar nomination for her performance in that film, but said that of all the films she's made, The Last Days of Disco is the one \\"people come up to me about\\" the most. Sevigny also stated that she became good friends on the set with co-star Subkoff, with whom she remained close after shooting. The two worked together on a fashion line called Imitation of Christ in 2003, along with Scarlett Johansson. The film was accessioned by the film library at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, where it is sometimes screened to the public. It was last shown at the museum's Pop Rally event in August 2009, with Stillman and Eigeman present for a question-and- answer session following the screening. Subkoff was also present during the Q & A. An after-party in celebration of the screening was advertised and held that evening as well. Home media The film was originally released on VHS and DVD in 1999 through Image Entertainment. This DVD release included the film's original theatrical trailer as the single bonus feature on the disc. After being unavailable for home media purchase for a significant time, the film received a second release, and was added to the esteemed Criterion Collection DVD series. It was the 485th film to enter the series, and was released on August 25, 2009, in a restored version that was approved by director Stillman. Stillman's first film in his 'trilogy', Metropolitan, was also released in the Criterion series three years prior. The Criterion release of The Last Days of Disco included as supplemental materials: an audio commentary with Whit Stillman, Chlo√´ Sevigny, and Chris Eigeman; four deleted scenes, a promotional making-of featurette, an audio recording of Stillman reading a passage from his film novelization, a still gallery with a text narrative by Stillman, and the original theatrical trailer. A liner essay by novelist David Schickler was also included as a paper insert in the package. The cover of the DVD features an illustration by French artist Pierre Le-Tan, depicting actresses Beckinsale and Sevigny preparing themselves in the powder room before entering the disco; the painting is a replication of a scene in the film. A Blu-ray was released by Criterion on July 24, 2012.

He is the king of the spirits, leader of the hosts of good, and enemy of Rangda, the demon queen and mother of all spirit guarders in the mythological traditions of Bali. The battle between Barong and Rangda is featured in the Barong dance to represent the eternal battle between good and evil.  Origin  Barong animal mask dance, together with sanghyang dance are considered native Balinese dances, predating Hindu influences. The native Indonesians of Austronesian heritage often have similar mask dances that represent either ancestral or natural spirits; an example is Dayak's Hudoq dance. The term barong is thought to have been derived from the local term bahruang, which today corresponds to the Indonesian word beruang which means \\"bear\\". It refers to a good spirit, that took the form of an animal as the guardian of forest. In Balinese mythology, the good spirit is identified as Banas Pati Raja. Banas Pati Raja is the fourth \\"brother\\" or spirit child that accompanies a child throughout their life, which is a similar concept to guardian angels. Banas Pati Raja is the spirit which animates Barong. A protector spirit, he is often represented as a lion. The Barong is often portrayed accompanied by two monkeys. Barong is portrayed as a lion with a red head, covered in white thick fur, and wearing gilded jewelry adorned with pieces of mirrors. The shape of lion Barong is somewhat similar to a Pekingese dog. The origins of the Barong are far back in time and quite uncertain. Its origins could be from animist worship, before Hinduism appeared, when villagers still believed in the supernatural protective power of animals. = Calon Arang = Barong, a mythical lion-like creature Rangda is Barong's opposite. While Barong represents good, Rangda represents evil. Rangda is known as a demon queen, the incarnation of Calon Arang, the legendary witch that wreaked havoc in ancient Java during the reign of Airlangga in the 10th century. It is said that Calon Arang was a widow who had mastered the art of black magic, who often damaged farmer's crops and caused disease to come. She had a girl, named Ratna Manggali, who, though beautiful, could not get a husband because people were afraid of her mother. Because of the difficulties faced by her daughter, Calon Arang was angry and she intended to take revenge by kidnapping a young girl. She brought the girl to a temple to be sacrificed to the goddess Durga. The next day, a great flood engulfed the village and many people died. Disease also appeared. King Airlangga, who had heard of this matter, then asked his advisor, Empu Bharada, to deal with this problem. Empu Bharada then sent his disciple, Empu Bahula, to be married to Ratna. Both were married with a huge feast that lasted seven days and seven nights, and the situation returned to normal. Calon Arang had a book that contained magic incantations. One day, this book was found by Empu Bahula, who turned it over to Empu Bharada. As soon as Calon Arang knew that the book had been stolen, she became angry and decided to fight Empu Bharada. Without the help of Durga, Calon Arang was defeated. Since she was defeated, the village was safe from the threat of Calon Arang's black magic. = Rangda = Rangda and Barong Another version holds that Rangda was actually linked to historical queen Mahendradatta or Gunapriyadharmapatni, a Javanese princess sister of Dharmawangsa of East Javanese Isyana Dynasty of late Medang Kingdom period. She was the queen consort of Balinese king Udayana and Airlangga's own mother. Mahendradatta is known for her devotion to the worship of Durga in Bali. The story goes that Mahendradatta, the mother of Airlangga, was condemned by Airlangga's father because she practiced black magic. After she became a widow (Rangda in old Javanese means: 'widow'), hurt and humiliated, she sought revenge upon her ex-husband's court and the whole of his kingdom. She summoned all the evil spirits in the jungle, the and the demons that caused plague and death in the kingdom. Airlangga had to face his own mother to save the kingdom. A fight occurred, but she and her black magic troops were so powerful that Airlangga had to ask for the help of the spirit king, Barong in order to defeat her. Barong came with Airlangga's soldiers, and a fight ensued. Rangda cast a spell that made Airlangga's soldiers all want to kill themselves, pointing their poisoned keris into their own stomachs and chests. In response, Barong cast a spell which caused the soldiers' bodies to be resistant to the sharp keris. At the end, Barong won, and Rangda ran away.  Barong dance  Barong dance performance with kris-wielding dancers and Rangda in Bali The lion is the popular one, as it comes from the Gianyar region, where Ubud (the home of tourist's Balinese dance ritual viewing) is located. Within the calon arang, the dance drama in which the Barong appears, the barong responds to Rangda's use of magic to control and kill her to restore balance. In traditional Barong dance performances, he is portrayed in his struggles against Rangda, it is the popular part of Balinese culture. The mythical creature would dance along the street to the calon arang dance. A priest would throw holy water at it. * The dance opens with two playful monkeys teasing Barong in a peaceful environment. * The next scene is popularly known as \\"Keris Dance\\". The Rangda character appears and wreaks havoc. She casts black magic upon male dancers, who represent Airlangga's soldiers, and orders them to commit suicide. In a trance, these men stab themselves on their chest with their own kris. Meanwhile, Barong and the priest cast protective magic on these men, which makes them invulnerable to sharp objects. * The dance ends with the final battle between Barong and Rangda, concluding with the victory of Barong over Rangda. Rangda runs away, the evil is defeated, and the celestial order is restored.  Variations  Barong Landung miniature in National Museum, Jakarta The lion barong is one of five traditional Barongs. In Bali each region of the island has its own protective spirit for its forests and lands. Each Barong for each region is modeled after a different animal. They are: =Barong Ket= Barong Ket & Rangda Lion barong as banaspati raja means king of the jungle, the most common Barong, it is the symbol of a good spirit, headdress uses sekar taji made of carved leather, sliced with prada and added with some small mirror decoration. =Barong Bangkal= Barong Bangkal in Indonesia Bangkal is an old pig in Bali and is considered a mythical animal that has strength. It is made of velvet fabric. Paraded on Galungan and Kuningan holidays. =Barong Macan= Barong shaped like a tiger that lives in the forest, its fur resembles a tiger fur made of velvet fabric. Tigers are famous mythical animals in stories in Bali, especially tantri. =Barong Asu= Very sacred barong asu is in Pacung, Tabanan. paraded especially on Galungan and Kuningan holidays. =Barong Gajah= The shape resembles an elephant from India. Barong is paraded around the village on Galungan and Kuningan holidays. =Barong Landung= Barong landung has a different form with barongs in Bali. This barong is not danced by 2 dancers as in general, this barong manifests like two male and female dolls, which are called 'Jero Luh' and 'Jero Gede', the form is similar to Betawi Ondel-ondel.

The goal of most organizations is to minimize the investment in inputs as well as operating expenses while increasing throughput of its production systems. Successful organizations which seek to gain market share strive to match throughput to the rate of market demand of its products. . Overview In the business management theory of constraints, throughput is the rate at which a system achieves its goal. Oftentimes, this is monetary revenue and is in contrast to output, which is inventory that may be sold or stored in a warehouse. In this case, throughput is measured by revenue received (or not) at the point of sale‚Äîexactly the right time. Output that becomes part of the inventory in a warehouse may mislead investors or others about the organizations condition by inflating the apparent value of its assets. The theory of constraints and throughput accounting explicitly avoid that trap. Throughput can be best described as the rate at which a system generates its products or services per unit of time. Businesses often measure their throughput using a mathematical equation known as Little's law, which is related to inventories and process time: time to fully process a single product. Basic formula Using Little's Law, one can calculate throughput with the equation: I=R*T where: *I is the number of units contained within the system, inventory; *T is the time it takes for all the inventory to go through the process, flow time; *R is the rate at which the process is delivering throughput, flow rate or throughput. If you solve for R, you will get: R=I/T References Further reading *Goldratt, Eliyahu and Jeff Cox. The Goal. Croton-on-Hudson: North River Press, 2004.

After the publication of his first two novels, Boyracers and The Incredible Adam Spark, he became known for his different take on Scots dialect writing, evolving a style specific to Falkirk, suffused with popular culture references and socialist politics. He also applied to be rector of Glasgow University in 2014. Bissett used to lecture in creative writing at Bretton Hall College, now part of the University of Leeds, and tutored the creative writing MLitt at the University of Glasgow alongside Janice Galloway and Tom Leonard.

Background Bissett was born in 1975. He attended Falkirk High School and then the University of Stirling, where he gained a First-Class Honours degree in English literature and education. After a short spell as a secondary-school teacher at Elgin Academy, Bissett was awarded a master's degree in English from the University of Stirling, during which time he edited a collection of Scottish Gothic stories, Damage Land (2001), and wrote his first novel, Boyracers. His stories were either short- or longlisted for the national Macallan Short-Story Competition four times between 1999 and 2002. His third novel, Death of a Ladies' Man, was published by Hachette Scotland in July 2009. In 2009 Bissett moved into playwriting: his first play, The Ching Room, was performed at Oran Mor and Traverse Theatre in March 2009, starring Andy Clarke and Colin McCredie.

His efforts in the 1950s and 1960s had a profound impact on the development of computational models of evolutionary systems. His seminal work, \\"Simulation of genetic systems by automatic digital computers\\" (1958), is quoted in the literature to this day. Fraser was born in London, England, and lived in Hong Kong for most of his youth. He studied at the University of New Zealand, and later went to the University of Edinburgh, and subsequently to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Sydney, Australia. It was at the CSIRO where Fraser made his seminal contributions to evolutionary computation. His earliest work was done on the SILIAC computer that was installed for the University of Sydney in 1956. The SILIAC was the Australian cousin to the ILLIAC machine that was developed at the University of Illinois. The machine was said to be running well when one could hear a 'rhythmic clicking of the relays inside it.' The clicking indicated that the computer was processing the iterations of the program correctly. Fraser began using it to simulate genetic selection processes. Fraser also starred in multiple TV shows during the early days of Australian television. His time with \\"Science in Close-Up\\" ended in a dramatic departure when censors refused to permit airing of a childbirth. Such footage is commonplace today but was forbidden at the time and that was why he walked out of the show. A surprisingly popular show was his \\"Doorway to Knowledge\\" as it was fairly sophisticated science that was broadcast at eleven o'clock in the morning. He achieved a certain measure of celebrity through the shows and he turned up quite regularly in the Sydney Morning Herald, the city's primary newspaper. In the 1960s, Fraser moved to the United States to act as visiting professor at the University of California at Davis. In 1967, he took over the Headship of Biological Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. In 1983, Fraser suffered a stroke which left him unable to converse normally. The timing of this event was most tragic because Fraser was left unable to engage his colleagues, just at the time when interest in evolutionary models and simulations was beginning to rise within computer science. In 1999, Fraser received the 1999 IEEE Neural Networks Council Pioneer Award in Evolutionary Computation. He died 14 July 2002 at the age of 78, as a result of complications from a heart attack.

In 1990 film producer Taylor Hackford made the movie Sweet Talker which starred and was written by Bryan Brown. Hackford invited Thompson to submit some ideas for a soundtrack and then asked him to work with Filleul to produce a full soundtrack for the film.

Bassanelli was a renaissance double reed woodwind instrument which was described in 1619 by Michael Praetorius in his Syntagma Musicum II: : \\"Bassanelli derive their name from the master who created them, Johann Bassanello, an illustrious Venetian musician and composer. The bore of bassanelli is straight and opens at the bottom; and these instruments only have one key. They are blown by direct contact with the reeds, exactly as are curtals, pommers, and bassets, and are nearly the same as these instruments in timbre, but much softer. The cant, which is the littlest of the bassanelli, is notably excellent to hear on the tenor part in ensembles in which all types and sets of instruments are used, for its tuning is rather accurate, and is similar to flutes in the execution of a tenor part. With good reeds, bassanelli can be made to play rather high. Like shawms, they have seven fingerholes, with a key on the lowest. In the rear, however, there is no hole to be found. They are pitched a fourth lower than chamber pitch, for their lowest size is the bass in F, but in chamber pitch this is understood as the 8 foot C.\\" Though Praetorius attributes the invention of bassanelli to Johann Bassanello (a.k.a. Giovanni Bassano), it is more likely Giovanni's father Santo who invented them.Lasocki, David, with Roger Prior, The Bassanos: Venetian musicians and instrument makers in England, 1531-1665 (Cambridge: Scolar Press, 1995), p. 217. As there are no surviving examples of bassanelli, there has been some disagreement concerning its construction, e.g. cylindrical versus conical bore. A comparison of the lengths for the various sizes shown in the scale drawings by Praetorius to the pitches he gave for them, indicates the acoustical properties of a conical bore. The fact that there is no thumbhole (like the shawm) also points to a conical bore instrument that overblows at the octave, with no need to extend the range upward by means of a thumbhole (as is seen on the crumhorn, sordun, and other cylindrical bore reed instruments.) The quiet timbre was apparently produced by a narrow conical bore without a terminal flare.

Process As described in inventions of Sylvester L. Steffen,; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; and chillcuring is an electrical ventilating process that facilitates the photoelectric after-ripening of bulk stored seeds. The ventilation process is controlled by monitoring the wet-bulb temperature of air around the grain (as measured by evaporative cooling), by which the grain is brought to equilibrium moisture and temperature with atmospheric air. Seed dormancy is better maintained at cooler (chill) atmospheric temperatures, and grain weight and seed vigor are better preserved. The after-ripening of seeds is a biochemical process of carbohydrate/protein stabilization associated with the chemical release of water (H:OH), a reverse process of hydrolysis. The triatomic molecules of water and carbon dioxide are especially reactive in attenuating infrared light-spectrum waves, which provides energy necessary in photosynthesis and (curing) after-ripening. Infrared electrical heat is supplied by ‚Äúgrainlamps‚Äù so as to energize water vapor in the air under high humidity conditions.

The petite Shay, at five-feet tall, was dubbed the \\"Pocket Venus\\" by Hollywood gossip columnists. Early life Shay was born in Cedarhurst, New York, the eldest daughter of a wealthy lawyer, Joseph A. Shay, and his wife, Lillian. She attended New York schools and a Swiss finishing school in France until age 14, when her father moved her and her younger sister, Adeline, to London. The family also lived in a house in Florence and a French chateau in Nice. When Shay was 19 years old, the family moved to Hollywood because of her father's work on behalf of various movie studios. She lived with her mother and sister at the Garden of Allah apartments which was populated by film stars. The family's friends and neighbors included Laurence Olivier, Harpo Marx, Gary Cooper and Ginger Rogers whom Shay said was her spa and skinny-dipping partner. Career When Shay decided she wanted to be an actress, her father contacted the heads of Fox and Paramount movies studio for their help. Quickly, she was given her first screen test with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and then studied acting with Clark Gable's wife, Josephine Dillon. Her first screen roles were small uncredited parts in such films as The Age of Consent (1932), A Bill of Divorcement (1932) starring John Barrymore and Billie Burke, and Roman Scandals (1933) with Eddie Cantor. Shay also dubbed the voice of Greta Garbo in Grand Hotel. Shay took a break from acting during her first marriages. After the second ended, she acted on Broadway in The Sap Runs High. She then returned to Hollywood in 1939 to play Joan Crawford's scene-stealing French maid in The Women. According to Shay, her friend Groucho Marx thought she had a gift for comedy and offered to write material for her, but Shay refused because she wanted to be known as a \\"serious\\" actress. After moving to England during World War II, and except for the 1948 film I Killed the Count, Shay gave up acting for the next two decades. In 1968 she returned to acting with a small role in the Julie Andrews film Star!. She appeared in the 1974 remake of The Great Gatsby. In 1976, director Ken Russell asked her to play an \\"aged American desperate for attention\\" in Valentino, his biography of Rudolph Valentino, in which she got to dance with the film's star, Rudolf Nureyev. Shay continued to act and make small appearances over the next 30 years including appearances in Candleshoe (1977), Superman III (1983), Death Wish 3 (1985), Little Shop of Horrors (1986) and Bullseye! (1990). Her last film was 1999's Parting Shots. Social life Although mostly an ingenue screen actress, Shay became well-publicized for her social life and romances. She was chauffeured around Hollywood in a Mercedes-Benz limousine, to the studios as well as parties and events. Although of diminutive stature, her beauty attracted many admirers, and Walter Winchell dubbed her \\"Hollywood's Pocket Venus\\". Shay's dates included Errol Flynn, Howard Hughes, Johnny Weissmuller, Victor Mature, Roy Rogers and Cecil B. DeMille. Shay married Thomas Francis Murphy in 1934. Murphy has been described as an attractive Irishman as well as a drunken philanderer who accumulated large debts. The marriage ended within the year. Shay remarried in 1936 to Winthrop Gardiner, a member of a prominent New York family descended from Lord Lion Gardiner.Obituary: \\"Winthrop Gardiner, Jr.\\" New York Times. October 18, 1980. After only six months, Shay filed for divorce because of Gardiner's much-publicized affair with ice skater Sonja Henie whom he later married. In 1940, Shay met British army captain Geoffrey Steele and fell in love. The couple married in 1941 amid speculation and bets by the tabloid magazines about how long the union would last. Shay said, \\"Most gave it 3 to 6 months. Nobody gave us forty years.\\" The couple remained married until Steel died in 1987. During World War II, Shay moved to England with Steele where she gave birth to a daughter, Georgiana. Over the next few decades she frequented Buckingham Palace and became a prominent figure in London society circles. Final years Shay suffered a stroke in 2004. Her final public appearance was the National Film Theatre's 2004 tribute to her favorite director, George Cukor. Shay died at the age of 94 in California while visiting her daughter, Georgiana Waller, the former wife of musician Gordon Waller.

The GR is expressed in almost every cell in the body and regulates genes controlling the development, metabolism, and immune response. Because the receptor gene is expressed in several forms, it has many different (pleiotropic) effects in different parts of the body. When glucocorticoids bind to GR, its primary mechanism of action is the regulation of gene transcription. [Free full text] The unbound receptor resides in the cytosol of the cell. After the receptor is bound to glucocorticoid, the receptor- glucocorticoid complex can take either of two paths. The activated GR complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus or represses the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in the cytosol (by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus). In humans, the GR protein is encoded by NR3C1 gene which is located on chromosome 5 (5q31).  Structure  Like the other steroid receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor is modular in structure and contains the following domains (labeled A - F): * A/B - N-terminal regulatory domain * C - DNA-binding domain (DBD) * D - hinge region * E - ligand-binding domain (LBD) * F - C-terminal domain  Ligand binding and response  In the absence of hormone, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resides in the cytosol complexed with a variety of proteins including heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and the protein FKBP52 (FK506-binding protein 52). The endogenous glucocorticoid hormone cortisol diffuses through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm and binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resulting in release of the heat shock proteins. The resulting activated form GR has two principal mechanisms of action, transactivation and transrepression, described below. = Transactivation = A direct mechanism of action involves homodimerization of the receptor, translocation via active transport into the nucleus, and binding to specific DNA responsive elements activating gene transcription. This mechanism of action is referred to as transactivation. The biological response depends on the cell type. = Transrepression = In the absence of activated GR, other transcription factors such as NF-Œ∫B or AP-1 themselves are able to transactivate target genes. However activated GR can complex with these other transcription factors and prevent them from binding their target genes and hence repress the expression of genes that are normally upregulated by NF-Œ∫B or AP-1. This indirect mechanism of action is referred to as transrepression.  Clinical significance  The GR is abnormal in familial glucocorticoid resistance. In central nervous system structures, the glucocorticoid receptor is gaining interest as a novel representative of neuroendocrine integration, functioning as a major component of endocrine influence - specifically the stress response - upon the brain. The receptor is now implicated in both short and long-term adaptations seen in response to stressors and may be critical to the understanding of psychological disorders, including some or all subtypes of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

He achieved his public fame with an economic analysis on China open-door policy after the 1980s. In his studies of economics, he focuses on economic explanation that is based on real world observation (an observation first approach). He is also the first to introduce concepts from the Chicago School of Economics, especially price theory, into China. In 2016, Cheung claimed to have written \\"1,500 articles and 20 books in Chinese\\" during his academic career. He obtained his PhD in economics from UCLA, where his teachers were the American economists Armen Alchian and Jack Hirshleifer. He taught in the Department of Economics at the University of Washington from 1969 to 1982, and then at the University of Hong Kong from 1982 to 2000. During this period, Cheung reformed the syllabus of Hong Kong's A-level Economics examination, adding the concepts of the postulate of constrained maximization, methodology, transaction cost and property right, most of which originate from the theories of the Chicago school. Academic career A Hakka of Huiyang, Guangdong ancestry born in Hong Kong in 1935, Cheung fled to China in 1941 due to the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. From 1959 to 1967, he studied Economics at UCLA and prepared a PhD dissertation. From 1967 to 1969, he did postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago, analysing share tenancy and variable rural land resource allocation, and was hired as an assistant professor after impressing Milton Friedman in a debate. In 1969, he moved to the University of Washington where he taught until 1982. Under the advice of several friends, including Ronald Coase, he returned to Hong Kong as a professor in University of Hong Kong to support the economic reforms of China. Unlike modern mainstream economists, Cheung's analysis does not rely on advanced mathematical techniques but solely on the two basic building blocks of price theory: one is the axiom of constrained maximisation and the other, the law of demand (one that already incorporates the law of diminishing marginal returns). One of the constraints which he emphasizes most is transaction cost (or better termed institutional cost). His theory of share tenancy has enhanced the understanding of contractual arrangement, which was largely ignored by neo- classical economists. According to Cheung, sharecropping is not necessarily exploitative. It will achieve the same efficient allocation as labor markets under competition and zero transaction costs (Cheung, 1968). In the presence of transaction costs, sharecropping can be efficient by lowering the monitoring costs of wage contracts and increasing risk-sharing benefits relative to rent contracts (Cheung, 1969). This implication is revolutionary; sharecropping was perceived as an inferior arrangement for years. After the publication of The Fable of The Bees, our perception of externalities is no longer the same: as long as corresponding property rights are clearly delineated, OR transaction cost is zero, externalities can be internalized through private negotiation/contract arrangement without government intervention. In 1983, Cheung published probably his most important journal article, \\"The Contractual Nature of the Firm\\". While a firm cannot be defined easily, Cheung interprets it as a kind of contractual arrangement being used to replace the market (i.e. price mechanism) to reduce transaction costs (e.g. the cost of price searching). Cheung once stated that when he finished writing the article, he knew that it would become a work that will last generations, and still be read a hundred years later. Thus, \\"[he] beheld the sky and laughed.\\" Outside of the academic world, Steven Cheung is most well known for his numerous writings directed at a popular audience, especially the Chinese public. He is also known for his famous wit; in 1969 he wrote an article \\"Irving Fisher and the Red Guards\\", published in the renowned Journal of Political Economy, arguing ironically that the activities of the Red Guards in China stemmed from their use of a \\"refined concept of capital\\". Unbeknownst to the readers, the article was written under considerable emotional pain; his close friend, the table tennis champion Rong Guotuan, had just committed suicide after being tortured by the Red Guards. Cheung maintained a lifelong friendship with former mentors Ronald Coase and Milton Friedman, the latter of whom officiated his wedding. He accompanied Friedman in his numerous tours of China, and was present when Friedman met with Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang to discuss economic reforms. Cheung was also an avid photographer. He took the most iconic photo of Milton Friedman, which was featured on the cover of Friedman's treatise Capitalism and Freedom. Criticism Nobel Prize winners like Ronald Coase\\"Ronald Coase's Nobel prize lecture\\" from nobelprize.org and Joseph E. Stiglitz\\"Joseph Stiglitz's Nobel prize lecture\\" (page 2/Footnote 2) from nobelprize.org have acknowledged intellectual provocation by Cheung in their respective Nobel lectures. [Coase citation missing]. While referring to Cheung's \\"brilliant, valiant attempt\\" to prove that sharecropping does not matter to the incentives of the workers, Stiglitz credited Cheung's \\"unreasonable assumptions, especially concerning information\\" for motivating him to develop the theories of the role of information in economics. Practical research Steven Cheung is highly respected for his deep devotion to his research. In order to understand real life phenomena, he personally engaged in numerous economic activities, such as fish farming, selling citrus fruit, inspecting the petroleum industry, and haggling over the price of antiques. He has criticized the isolation of most economists from real life problems. Contribution to economics and China's economic development Cheung's contribution to economics and China's economic development can be roughly grouped in the following areas, # New Institutional Economics ## how different kinds of contractual arrangement affect transaction costs, which are often ignored by neoclassical economists ## realizing the importance of transaction costs (as Cheung often mentions in his writings, if there is no transaction costs (the original starting point assumption by Coase), there is no difference in using different institutional arrangements (e.g. market or government)). ## the nature of the firm (a government, to a certain extent, is a firm and can be more efficient than the market in some areas), # Methodology ## emphasis on economic explanation (according to Cheung, economic explanation is the ONLY objective of the study of economics); ## the analysis of relevant and observable real world constraints: Adam Smith's tradition, ## downward sloping demand curve: Neoclassical tradition, ## theories must be potentially refutable but not yet refuted (Cheung considers many mainstream concepts not observable, leading to the non-refutable nature of many theories (such as utilities, welfare)) ## focus on capturing the underlying and relevant constraints to explain economic phenomena that might seem odd and strange on the surface. # China's economic development ## Considerable influence among the Chinese speaking population (most of his works after 1982 are written in Chinese); ## Prediction of China's institutional reform (which, in general, has been quite accurate) ## Analysis of the deficiencies in the Chinese state owned enterprises =Comments on China's modernization= He wrote many books (in Chinese) commenting on China's modernization programs from an economic point of view. In the 1980s, Cheung predicted and strongly supported an economic transformation of China as a market economy. However, in that decade, China went through serious inflation, leading to strong economic, political and social tensions. However, after 1992, China continued to reform economically. Steven Cheung claimed that most of his predictions have come true. One of his major ideas, the replacing of state-owned enterprises by private enterprises, turns out to be very consistent with the direction taken by Chinese political leaders and policy makers. Later on, after the leaders of Shanghai began economic reforms, he predicted that it would immediately become one of the financial centers of the world, surpassing Hong Kong. The prediction was met with heavy skepticism, but turned out to be correct in some respect. As of 31 January 2015, Shanghai Stock Exchange overtook the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in terms of market capitalization. However, Shanghai has yet to catch up with Hong Kong in terms of financial infrastructure, and Shanghai's dream of overtaking Hong Kong has yet to be fully fulfilled. Legal troubles On January 28, 2003, Cheung was indicted on thirteen counts by a US federal grand jury. The charges consisted of six counts of filing a false income tax return, six counts of filing false foreign bank account reports, and one count of Conspiracy to Defraud the United States. Cheung was accused of failing to report incomes from Hong Kong parking lots and other business. As a U.S. citizen, Cheung is obliged to report incomes from anywhere in the world, even if he does not reside in the United States. The law is uncommon in other countries. Cheung insists that he relied on the advice of his tax consultant, and did not know he was supposed to report the income in question. Experts have said that ignorance of the U.S. tax policy is common among U.S. expatriates; the U.S. government generally does not pursue investigations of failures to report overseas income for non-residents. When discovered, offenders are often simply requested to turn in the unpaid tax. It is unknown why the U.S. government chose to investigate Cheung, and further to pursue a federal grand jury indictment; journalists have suspected ulterior motives. Originally a professor at University of Hong Kong, because of the extradition agreements between the US and Hong Kong, Cheung has since stayed in mainland China, a country that has no such agreements with America. He now writes books and works as a columnist for the China website ifeng.com. Occasionally, he pays visits to various universities in mainland China. From 1998 to 2003, Steven Cheung's company, Steven N. S. Cheung Inc. had a subsidiary in Seattle called Thesaurus Fine Arts, which specialized in Asian antique pieces. The store closed when a series of investigative reports in the Seattle Times alleged that many of the antiques were fake. [source needed] In 2004, the Washington State Attorney General filed consumer fraud charges against Thesaurus Fine Arts. In 2005, Thesaurus Fine Arts settled for up to $550,000 in fines, attorney fees, and restitution. Cheung was dropped from the case as a result. Cheung has denied ownership of Thesaurus. Thesaurus is a subsidiary of Steven N. S. Cheung Inc., but it is claimed that Cheung is \\"not an officer, director or shareholder\\" of Thesaurus.

Later consisting of Harvey Williams, Jonathan Akerman, Keris Howard, Michael Hiscock, and Beth Arzy who replaced Annemari Davies in 2000. Initially begun as a side project of Wratten's previous band Northern Picture Library, Trembling Blue Stars became Wratten's main band when Northern Picture Library broke up in 1995. Wratten took the name of his band from The Story of O by Pauline R√©age. Trembling Blue Stars are characterized by melancholic songs with shimmering guitars and introspective lyrics. Many of their early lyrics address Wratten's relationship with Annemari Davies, who had been in The Field Mice and Northern Picture Library with him. The first Trembling Blue Stars album, Her Handwriting, was released in 1996 on Shinkansen Recordings (the successor of Sarah Records), to critical acclaim. Wratten afterwards assembled a band, which at various times included Davies, Gemma Townley, Cath Carroll and Ian Catt, as well as Michael Hiscock, Keris Howard (previously of the Sarah Records-era band Brighter) and Harvey Williams. Producer Ian Catt has worked on every Trembling Blue Stars release. Lips That Taste of Tears, the band's second album, was released in April 1997. The album received acclaim again, although the group proved reluctant to tour extensively. Broken By Whispers, their third long player, was released in 2000 and saw them getting more press and radio play. \\"Dark Eyes\\" was voted Single of the Week on Mark Radcliffe's show on BBC Radio 1. The overall mood was melancholic, but Broken By Whispers saw the band experimenting with more bass and synth sounds. Indeed, this album was picked up by Seattle's Sub Pop Records and gave the band their first release in North America. They also recorded a live session on the John Peel show in 2001. In 2001, Trembling Blue Stars released Alive To Every Smile, which still featured Annemari Davies on vocals, along with Beth Arzy. The album was widely acclaimed and added more synth and beats, notably to one of their best known songs, \\"The Ghost of an Unkissed Kiss\\", which combined a dance-pop sensibility with more traditional indie sounds. Multiple EP releases appeared in between albums. The band also gathered together singles for the compilation A Certain Evening Light in 2003. In 2005, their fifth album The Seven Autumn Flowers was released on Bar/None Records in both the USA and UK after a break with Shinkansen. A brief mini- tour of the USA in late 2005 promoted it. Their sixth album The Last Holy Writer was released through Elefant Records in 2007, with tracks from it featured in the Australian feature film The Sculptor. Trembling Blue Stars issued their seventh album Fast Trains and Telegraph Wires in October 2010, but split at the end of that year following the release of a final farewell EP, Correspondence.

Biography Wierwille was raised in and later ordained by the Evangelical and Reformed Church (a predecessor of the United Church of Christ) in 1941, and he officially left that church in 1957. Wierwille graduated from Mission House College with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Theology degrees.\\"Power For Abundant Living. American Christian Press. 1971. p379\\" He then studied at The University of Chicago Divinity School and received a Master of Theology in practical theology from Princeton Theological Seminary.\\"Studies in Abundant Living: Order My Steps In Thy Word. American Christian Press. 1985. pg303\\" Wierwille later studied at Pikes Peak Bible Seminary and Burton College, a non-accredited institution, and received a doctorate in theology. In October 1942 he started the precursor to The Way International (a nontrinitarian Christian organization), Vesper Chimes, which was a radio show broadcast from Lima, Ohio, incorporating in 1947 as The Chimes Hour Youth Caravan. He incorporated as The Way Incorporated in 1955, maintaining that this was the name that early Christians used for themselves basing his assertion on several uses of \\"the way\\" or \\"this way\\" in Acts of the Apostles. Later the official name became The Way International. Wierwille authored several books that are printed by The Way International's American Christian Press publishing organization. One book was Jesus Christ is Not God, in which he addressed his belief that Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God and Messiah but not a persona of the Christian God. \\"Jesus Christ is Not God. American Christian Press. 1975\\" Wierwille wrote three other works which focused on Jesus Christ and the concept of the Holy Spirit: Jesus Christ Our Passover, Jesus Christ Our Promised Seed, and Receiving the Holy Spirit Today. Other major works include Power for Abundant Living, Christians Should Be Prosperous, Are the Dead Alive Now? and his Studies in Abundant Living five- volume series. Wierwille became associated in 1957\\"The Aramaic New Testament Estrangelo Script. American Christian Press. 1983. p7\\" with Aramaic Bible scholar George Lamsa, who finished his translation work for the Lamsa Bible in Wierwille's home.\\"The Aramaic-English New Testament.

American Christian Press. 1988. p7\\" Believing the original New Testament was written in Aramaic, Wierwille was a supporter of Lamsa's translation of the Bible and used it frequently. On February 2, 1961, he moved The Way International headquarters to New Knoxville, Ohio, on approximately of family farm land. After graduating from B. G. Leonard's Gifts of the Spirit class in Calgary, Alberta, Wierwille began teaching a similar class that he initially called Receiving the Holy Spirit Today but soon changed to Power for Abundant Living (PFAL). Eventually he expanded it into a teaching series, including a foundational, intermediate, and advanced class. Wierwille was the president of The Way International from its incorporation until he retired from leadership in October, 1982. He was followed by his hand-picked successor, L. Craig Martindale. Martindale was a former Baptist Student Union and Fellowship of Christian Athletes leader at the University of Kansas, where he played football in the early 1970s. After his retirement, Wierwille‚Äôs health deteriorated rapidly. He died of ocular cancer on May 20, 1985, at age 68.

It was the first railway station in Berlin, opening in 1838. It was located at Potsdamer Platz, about 1 km south of the Brandenburg Gate, and kick-started the transformation of Potsdamer Platz from an area of quiet villas near the south-east corner of the Tiergarten park into the bustling focal point that it eventually became. For more than a century it was the terminus for long-distance and suburban trains. Also located at this spot were underground stations on the Berlin U-Bahn and S-Bahn, and today's new underground Regionalbahnhof, known as Bahnhof Potsdamer Platz, while the short-lived M-Bahn crossed the site of the former terminus.  Early days  The Potsdamer Bahnhof was the Berlin terminus of the city's first railway, linking it with Potsdam. Begun in 1835, it was opened from the Potsdam end as far as Zehlendorf on 22 September 1838, and its entire length of 26 km on 29 October. The first train was hauled by a British-built locomotive, the work of Robert Stephenson at his Newcastle-upon-Tyne works in 1835, and called Adler (Eagle). In 1848 the lines were extended west to Magdeburg, to link up with routes extending across the future German state. The whole area around the Berlin terminus became a major focus for urban growth after its opening. Five major streets eventually converged here, most having started out as mere rough tracks through the Tiergarten park and adjoining fields.  A new terminus  The first Potsdamer Bahnhof lasted until 1869, when it was superseded by a far grander structure in response to growing traffic, built by Julius Ludwig Quassowski (1824‚Äì1909) with five platforms, a trainshed roof that was 173m long and 36m wide, a booking hall with separate waiting rooms and facilities for four classes of ticket holders, and a separate entrance and reception area on the west side for visiting royalty. Opened on 30 August 1872, it eventually handled train services to and from Cologne, Paris, Frankfurt/Main, Strasbourg and Aix en Provence. By 1890 over 3 million people a year were using it, and it was holding its own against a larger rival down the road (the Anhalter Bahnhof).  Ringbahnhof and Wannsee Bahnhof  Location of the main station and its Wannseebahn and Ringbahn appendices in 1910, shadowed with the situation of 1980‚Äì85 Still the facilities could not cope, and so in 1890‚Äì1891 two additional termini were built on either side of it for short-haul and suburban traffic: on the east side, the Ringbahnhof, opened on 1 April 1891 to serve the Ringbahn itself, the circular route skirting the city's perimeter with connections to all the main termini and open throughout its length since 15 November 1877; and the Wannsee Bahnhof on the west side, opened on 1 October 1891 for trains to Wannsee and the south western suburbs. Both these stations were located further south, with the north entries just north of the line Bernburger Stra√üe. In 1901, separate tracks for the suburban line along the Anhalter Bahn to Lichterfelde-Ost were built together with a number of new stations. The Berlin city terminus was moved from the Anhalter Bahnhof to the Potdam Ringbahn station. This line was the first Berlin suburban line to be electrified with Third Rail, opened on 2 July 1903. Originally using 550 V DC, it was converted to 800 V in April 1929, in the course of the \\"Grand Electrification\\" of the core of Berlin's city, Ring, and suburban lines. The lines terminating in the Potsdamer Bahnhof Wannsee station and the mainline terminus had to wait until 15 May 1933 to be electrified. The Ringbahnhof ultimately handled many times as many passengers as the mainline terminus.  1930s heyday  Although smaller than the Anhalter Bahnhof, the Potsdamer Bahnhof was much the busier of the two. By 1939 up to 83,000 people per day were using it, actually making it the busiest station in Berlin by a considerable distance. Since most of these were specifically using the Ringbahnhof, it gave the impression that the entire terminus was simply a suburban or commuter station handling exclusively short haul services, yet the main line services, including those to Paris and other French destinations, were definitely still running. The previous year, the terminus, together with the line from Potsdam, had reached its centenary, and the celebrations featured an operational replica of the \\"Adler\\" locomotive that had hauled the very first train 100 years previously (the original loco had been scrapped at Augsburg in 1857). The replica was the work of the DRG restoration workshop at Kaiserslautern in 1935. In 1939 the Wannsee Bahnhof on the west side closed, superseded by the new S-Bahn North-South Link described below.  World War II and its aftermath  The fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof was determined by World War II, and yet even if the war had not occurred, major changes would still have taken place. Under the grand plan by Adolf Hitler (1889‚Äì1945), to transform Berlin into the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania, to be realised by Albert Speer (1905‚Äì81), the building would have ceased to be a railway terminus. The new North-South Axis, the linchpin of the plan, would have severed its approach tracks, leaving the terminus stranded on the wrong side of it. All trains arriving in Berlin would have run into either of two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn to the north and south of the centre respectively, to be known as Nordbahnhof (North Station) and S√ºdbahnhof (South Station), located at Wedding and S√ºdkreuz. The intended fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof has not been documented. In any event, things took a very different course. During World War II the terminus, like most of Berlin, was devastated by Royal Air Force and US Air Force bombs and Soviet artillery shells. Despite some rubble clearance and emergency repairs, damage to rail infrastructure further out was so great that the mainline terminus never saw another train, it and the Ringbahnhof finally closed on 3 August 1944. Shortly after the war's end the Ringbahnhof received a reprieve of sorts, temporarily reopening on 6 August 1945 as terminus of the Wannseebahn trains, while the U-Bahn and S-Bahn received massive repairs (megalitres of water had to be pumped out for starters). The Ringbahnhof closed for good on 27 July 1946 after some fragmentary train workings had resumed along the U-Bahn and North-South Tunnel on 2 June. The services were extended further in 1951. Potsdamer Bahnhof had a unique location in post-war Berlin. Located in the so-called lower Friedrichsvorstadt the Potsdamer Bahnhof became part of the new Kreuzberg borough in 1920. Since a change of borough boundaries in 1938, the boroughs of Tiergarten and Kreuzberg lay on either side of Potsdamer Bahnhof, but the boundary of the borough of Mitte skirted around the site of Potsdamer Bahnhof,http://blog.andie.org.uk/2014/01/bahnhof-potsdamer-platz.html so it formed a long thin rectangle within Mitte extending as a salient south from the rest of Mitte towards, and just over, the Landwehr Canal.http://www.alt- berlin.info/cgi/stp/lana.pl?nr=10&gr;=7&nord;=52.500435&ost;=13.385738 The result was that Potsdamer Bahnhof was in the Soviet Sector of Berlin, which became the de facto capital of East Germany, while the approach track and neighbourhood to the East were in the American Sector of Berlin, and the neighbourhood to the West in the British Sector. As a terminus within East Berlin, but with its approach tracks coming through West Berlin, as with the Stettiner Bahnhof, the Deutsche Reichsbahn were not particularly anxious to restore many services to the station. Another interruption of services was caused by the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, no trains running between 17 June, the day of the uprising, and 9 July. Above ground the remains of the terminus were cleared away in stages between 1957 and 1960 after a vague attempt at restoration was aborted. Besides the Dresdner and Hamburger Bahnh√∂fe (which were not operating by the time of WWII) all of Berlin's other rail termini suffered a similar fate, leaving a network that remained fragmented and inconvenient for decades, exacerbated by the Division of Berlin and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 (see below). The building of the Berlin Wall had a further impact. The now-derelict site of the station would have required two or more kilometres of wall to surround an unused area of 8.5-hectares. The East German regime decided to leave the site of the Potsdamer Bahnhof outside of the wall, although it remained formally and legally part of the Soviet Sector until 21 December 1971, when East Germany were paid DM 31 million for this piece of land as part of a wider land swap. By contrast, the route of the S-Bahn through the Berlin Nord-S√ºd Tunnel having been re-opened, as described above, crossed under the Berlin Wall between Anhalter Bahnhof and the Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station, so the Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station closed, like the other stations in East Berlin on the North-South line (apart from Friedrichstra√üe). Trains that were now only for use in West Berlin travelled between Anhalter Bahnhof via Friedrichstra√üe without stopping, and then on to Humboldthain. The Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station remained closed until 1 March 1992. The building of the Berlin Wall and the closure of Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station left the area to the West of the site of the Potsdamer Bahnhof a long way from rapid transport networks. West Berlin's purchase of the site from the East opened an opportunity to solve that problem, and trains, of a sort, returned to the site of the station, since a part of Tiergarten quarter, in the shape of the short-lived M-Bahn, which crossed the site. However, the purpose of the M-Bahn disappeared with the fall of the Wall, and it was quickly dismantled and removed, since the trackbed at Gleisdreieck was an obstruction to re-unifying the ends of the U2 Underground line, which since re-instatement has also effectively replaced the M-Bahn.  The Potsdamer Bahnhof site today  Potsdamer Platz with the site of the Potsdamer Bahnhof in September 2005. The long green strip is Tilla Durieux Park, the site of the former station and its approaches. The road running down its left (eastern) side is Gabriele Tergit Promenade, named after the German writer and journalist Gabriele Tergit (1894-1982), while the road running down the right (west) side is Linkstra√üe, a bygone thoroughfare from former times now resurrected, but realigned a few metres east of its old route Plan of the Berlin North‚ÄìSouth mainline. The site of Potsdamer Bahnhof is in the bottom third of plan, on the route of the (new) main line, while the site of another former station Anhalter Bahnhof is almost parallel parkland, but further towards the South Eastern corner of the plan Today a number of vast new developments can be seen around Potsdamer Platz. Despite some initial reservations, the new quarter has become a commercial success, and a must-see for the majority of visitors to Berlin. Where the Potsdamer Bahnhof once stood is a long landscaped strip of land named after the Austrian actress Tilla Durieux (1880‚Äì1971), stretching for 450 m down to the Landwehrkanal. Despite appearances on the surface, long-distance trains have returned to the site, since the Berlin North‚ÄìSouth mainline runs under the site of the Potsdamer Bahnhof, with the Potsdamer Platz station extending under some of the site of the Potsdamer Bahnhof. A major fire at the DB Museum (German State Railway Museum) in Nuremberg on the night of 17/18 October 2005 destroyed a historical shed and 25 locomotives including the Adler replica featured in the centenary celebrations for the Potsdamer Bahnhof in 1938. Deutsche Bahn have apparently ordered another operational replica in time for the 175th anniversary celebrations in 2010, for the Nuremberg - F√ºrth railway line, Germany's first.

USAB was a combined command with the Headquarters, U.S. Command Berlin (USCOB). This combined organization was sometimes called the \\"Berlin Command\\". USCOB/USAB was a separate command from the U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) which had previously been in command of American troops in West Berlin. The major general who commanded this organization held the title of \\"Commandant; U.S. Commander Berlin; Commander, U.S. Army Berlin\\". A brigadier general served as the \\"Commander, Berlin Brigade (Infantry); Deputy Commander, U.S. Army Berlin and Community Commander\\".

Units under the command of USAB included the Berlin Brigade, the Medical and Dental Activities, Tempelhof Central Airport (United States Air Force base), Armed Forces Network (radio and television affiliate AFN Berlin), the U.S. Military Liaison Mission and the United States Army Field Station Berlin. Troops assigned to USAB were housed at several kasernes in Zehlendorf and Steglitz, including Andrews Barracks, McNair Barracks, and Turner Barracks. Families lived in the housing areas near the Clay Compound, and in the D√ºppel, Dahlem, and Lichterfelde neighborhoods. Truman Plaza, located across Clayallee from the Clay Headquarters Compound, held the post exchange, commissary, Army Post Office (APO), American Express bank, Stars & Stripes book store, barber, florist, Deutsche Bundespost, and the Major Arthur D. Nicholson Memorial Library. Schools for the children of service members, Thomas A. Roberts Berlin American Elementary School (TAR) and Berlin-American High School (BAHS), were located close to Truman Plaza.  History  After the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, the presence of U.S. military forces in Berlin was no longer necessary, but was retained (along with the British and French forces) until the Russian military withdrew from eastern Germany. USAB was inactivated on 12 July 1994 with President Bill Clinton participating in the casing of the colors ceremony. Since then, USAB housing areas, schools, and the Army Hospital have reverted to civilian use, some for German citizens, and others being taken over by the U.S. Embassy. Truman Plaza was razed in anticipation of new housing for employees of the German federal government relocating from the former capital Bonn, which began in 2009/2010. Across the street from Truman Plaza was the Berlin Brigade headquarters, part of which serves as an annex of the Embassy of the United States in Berlin. The nearby library and adjoining Outpost Theater have been converted into the Allied Museum, which documents the American, British and French presence in Berlin during the Cold War.

The Rights of All replaced Freedom's Journal, the nation's first African American newspaper, which had been founded by Cornish together with John Russwurm. Cornish had resigned from Freedom's Journal after six months, and under Russwurm's sole editorship, it reversed its opposition to the American Colonization Society to become a pro- colonizationist organ, running along these lines until Russwurm moved to Liberia in late 1829. In launching The Rights of All, Cornish reemphasized the opposition to the American Colonization Society that had been a signature theme of the early months of Freedom's Journal. Yet there was a great deal of continuity between the two publications, and The Rights of All deployed the same subscription agents, including radical abolitionist David Walker, who promoted the publication in his Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World. Cornish estimated that The Rights of All had about 800 subscribers, but despite this robust support, the journal survived less than a year.  References  * David E.

After the end of World War II, under the conditions of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, the Allied forces occupied West Berlin. This occupation lasted throughout the Cold War. The French Army also had units in Berlin, called Forces Fran√ßaises √† Berlin and the British Army's unit in Berlin was the Berlin Infantry Brigade. US Army's Berlin Brigade patch Brigadier General John E. Rogers and Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Dorofeev (Soviet Union) at Spandau Prison in 1981 Soldiers of the Berlin Brigade guarding Spandau Prison Contrasting roles of the Berlin troops‚Äî1970 soldier's jammed locker includes uniforms for a variety of duties along with big-city dress clothes History The Berlin Brigade of the United States Army was a separate brigade based in Berlin. Its shoulder sleeve insignia was the U.S. Army Europe patch with a Berlin tab, later incorporated. During the Berlin Wall Crisis of 1961, the Army reorganized the command structure of the forces in Berlin and created the U.S. Army Berlin and created the Berlin Brigade from the units already in the city. The 6th Infantry Regiment, active in Germany since 1950, was reorganized in mid-1958 according to the Pentomic structure: Each battle group consisted of five line (rifle) companies, a combat support company, and a headquarters & headquarters company. The Berlin Brigade had the 2nd and 3rd Battle Groups, 6th Infantry until 1963, when Army force structure abandoned battle groups in favor of brigades and subordinate battalions. The reorganized brigade consisted of the following units: *2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry *3rd Battalion, 6th Infantry *4th Battalion, 18th Infantry (reflagged on 13 September 1972 as the 4th Battalion, 6th Infantry) *Battery C, 94th Field Artillery *Company F (later 6th Battalion), 40th Armor (Turner Barracks) *42nd Engineer Company *42nd AG Unit (Postal) *42nd Military Police Group (Customs) (attached elements) *287th Military Police Company (Separate) *43rd Chemical Detachment *76th Chemical Detachment *279th Station Hospital (became US Army Hospital Berlin in 1976) *168th Medical Detachment (Veterinary Service) *592nd Signal Company *298th Army Band *AFN Europe AM FM TV *Rail Transportation Office -RTO (Berlin Licherfelde West train station) *Berlin Brigade Aviation Detachment (Tempelhof Central Airport) *US Army Engineers-DEH Detachment Engineering & Housing (Von Steuben compound) *US Military Liaison Mission Potsdam -USMLM *Detachment A - 39th Special Forces Operational Detachment (1956-1990) The 168th and 298th share the distinction of being the longest-serving units in Berlin. They both arrived in the city in a 37-vehicle convoy on 3 July 1945. The commanders of both units were old high school classmates. The brigade's infantry battalions were reflagged again in 1984 as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 502nd Infantry Regiment, and Battery C, 94th FA was reflagged as Battery E, 320th Field Artillery. From 1947 to 1987, brigade soldiers were tasked with month-long rotations at Spandau Prison. These rotations, shared with British, French and Soviet soldiers, continued until Spandau's last prisoner, Rudolf Hess, died in 1987. Until the end of the Cold War, members of the brigade were eligible for the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany clasp. Because of the legal status of West Berlin, it was technically occupied territory left over from World War II. During the early 1980s, the U.S. Army Regimental System initiative renamed a large percentage of infantry, armor and artillery battalions to align overseas commands with units assigned to stateside brigades, reinforcing the Army's regimental designations and unit morale. The original intent was to initiate personnel replacement and rotations within regiments, a \\"next step\\" that did not provide sufficient flexibility to Army personnel managers. The impact on Berlin-based infantry battalions was to reflagged the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions, 6th Infantry as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 502nd Infantry, respectively, during the summer of 1984, assigning Berlin infantry units a shared identification with infantry battalions of 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the operational structure of the Brigade was as follows: * Berlin Brigade ** 4th Bn, 502nd Infantry Regiment, (6x M106, 12x M901, 14x M113, 8x M125) ** 5th Bn, 502nd Infantry Regiment, (6x M106, 12x M901, 14x M113, 8x M125) ** 6th Bn, 502nd Infantry Regiment, (6x M106, 12x M901, 14x M113, 8x M125) ** Combat Support Battalion *** HHC, (2x M1A1) *** D Company, 40th Armor Regiment, (14x M1A1) *** F Company, 40th Armor Regiment, (14x M1A1) *** E Battery, 320th Field Artillery Regiment, (8x M109A3) *** 42nd Engineer Company (3x M728 CEV) ** 42nd Postal Unit ** 298th Army Band ** AFN Europe AM FM TV ** 43rd Chemical Detachment ** 766th Military Intelligence Detachment ** Berlin Brigade Aviation Detachment (6x Bell UH-1H, 2x Pilatus UV-20A Chiricahua, 1x Beechcraft C-12C Huron) ** US Military Liaison Mission Potsdam -USMLM ** US Army Signal Support Company Field Station Berlin Soldiers who deployed to support Desert Storm Individual members of the brigade with Intelligence specialties from 766 Military Intelligence Detachment & Field Station Berlin, deployed to Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1990‚Äì1991, filling short falls for other units in USAREUR But the first Berlin Brigade units to take part in an out-of-theater operation were the command-and-staff element of Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), as well as one platoon from Company D, 6th Battalion, 502nd Infantry, and the 42nd Engineer Company. These units were later joined by the members of the 42nd AG Unit (Postal). These units served in Operation Provide Comfort II, a relief and protection mission for Iraqi Kurds. They served with a multinational \\"Allied Ground Combat Force\\" that also included British, French, Italian, Dutch, and Turkish infantry companies. Based in Silopi, Turkey, near the Iraqi border, from July to October 1991, these ground forces were soon withdrawn to avoid entanglement in the local Turkish-PKK conflict and because it was decided that the US Air Force presence at Incirlik constituted an adequate deterrent to Iraqi attempts at encroaching on the Kurdish autonomous zone. Soldiers of this task force were authorized to wear the Berlin Brigade shoulder sleeve insignia as a combat patch on the right shoulder of their uniform, the first and only time elements of the Berlin Brigade were authorized to do so. Elements of the Berlin Brigade were the first combat units selected to deploy as a member of the United Nations Protectionary Forces (UNPROFOR) to Macedonia in July 1993; later to be renamed Task Force Able Sentry. Under the treaties that enabled the reunification of Germany, all non-German military forces were required to leave Berlin. The Berlin Brigade was officially inactivated by President Bill Clinton on 6 July 1994. The last unit to leave Berlin was the 42nd AG Unit (Postal). The 42nd was a small unit responsible for the mail service for the military assigned to Berlin, the Potsdam unit, and the Helmstedt detachment. It received very little recognition but was vital to the morale of the brigade Besides postal service, the unit also performed other services, such as courier duty throughout the European theater. The unit was based at Andrews Barracks under Special Troops. Historical notes The 287th Military Police Company was the only US Army MP unit to use boats for water patrol along the border to East Germany. The Berlin Brigade Aviation Detachment at Tempelhof Central Airport was the last US Army unit worldwide to use the DeHavilland Canada U-6 Beaver, when retired in January 1980. Its replacement was the UV-20A Chiricahua (two delivered in 1979),for which the unit was also the first and until 1991 only operator within the US ARMY.url=http://www.theberlinobserver.com/archive/1980V36/V36_N7_feb15.pdf title=Page 5 Last two U-6s retired berlin Observer 15 February 1980 publisher=http://www.theberlinobserver.com accessdate=2019-06-10}} The Rail Transportation Office operated the only regular US Army Transportation Corps trains (between West Berlin and West Germany) through a communist controlled country for 45 years, pulled by east German Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotives.

Regarded by his sympathisers as a 'race martyr', he briefly became a cause c√©l√®bre for the tabloid press in the 1970s. Early years Relf spent most of his working life as a bus driver although he also had a spell as a paratrooper. He was involved in far-right activity in the Midlands during the 1960s and was arrested in 1965 as a suspect in a cross burning incident. Following this incident he was invited onto Midlands Today to present his point of view, an appearance widely condemned by anti-racist campaigners in the region.Gavin Schaffer, The Vision of a Nation: Making Multiculturalism on British Television, 1960-80, Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, p. 106 House sale controversy and aftermath Relf first came to national attention in 1976 when he advertised his house in Leamington Spa as being 'For Sale - to an English family only'.ITN - Birmingham man advertising house for sale to English family only stays in jail The sign had initially read \\"Viewing.

Demonstrations were held, particularly in the Midlands, demanding his release, although counter- demonstrations endorsing the sentence were also organised.Back & Solomos, Race, Politics and Social Change, p. 62 One such event in Handsworth ended in a riot with 28 arrests as National Front and anti-fascist demonstrators clashed when their respective marches met.Tahir Abbas, Frank Reeves, Immigration and Race Relations: Sociological Theory and John Rex, I. B. Tauris, 2007, p. 138 However, fervour for Relf's cause soon died after articles about his background began to appear in the Sunday Times, revealing that Relf had been a member of the British Movement and had served as a bodyguard to Colin Jordan as well as attempting to organise a UK branch of the Ku Klux Klan.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 184 Relf, who staged a hunger strike during his incarceration,Christopher T. Husbands, Racial Exclusionism and the City: The Urban Support of the National Front, Routledge, 2013, p. 12 was released from prison the same year, although by now much of the popular support that he had gathered had died away. He would go on to rejoin the British Movement, although he left due to his dissatisfaction with the leadership of Michael McLaughlin and instead devoted much of his energies to the World Union of National Socialists, at the time led by Povl Riis- Knudsen. He also been associated with the National Front and it became his main area of domestic activity after he left the BM (although he had also been courted by the National Party who, along with the NF and BM, played a leading role in the campaign for his release).S. Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 162 Having gained notoriety Relf continued to perform publicity stunts, notably in September 1978 when he was handed a ¬£10 fine for refusing to wear a motorcycle helmet in protest at the legal exemption from the requirement for Sikhs.Taylor, op cit Relf was jailed soon afterwards for publishing racial hatred materials, and immediately went on hunger strike, sparking another NF led campaign for his release.taylor, op cit He helped to set up White Nationalist Crusade, an attempt to create an umbrella movement for the far right in Britain, although this proved unsuccessful and he briefly led his own White Power Movement the following year.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 195 Later years Relf largely disappeared from public life until 1991 when he again became involved in controversy, this time over a letter sent to the Conservative Party in Cheltenham. In the letter Relf attacked local Tories for their decision to endorse John Taylor, a black man and current member of the House of Lords, as their candidate for the 1992 general election. Relf suggested that those who had chosen Taylor should be 'strung up' because Taylor wanted 'a nation of half breeds'.English census rebel jailed Taylor failed to win the traditionally Conservative seat of Cheltenham in the 1992 election, losing to Nigel Jones of the Liberal Democrats. In 2002 Relf was jailed for a week after refusing to complete a census form because he was not happy to indicate his nationality as \\"British\\", preferring \\"English\\". He had originally been fined for the offence but refused to pay on principle. Later that same year he was fined for sending postcards deemed to be offensive to Warwick police station. Relf had sent the cards after reading a story that the local police had removed a poster promoting a Saint George's Day event.

He was the mayor of Bethlehem from 1972 to 1997. Freij was born in 1918 in Bethlehem to a family which could trace its residence in Bethlehem back 500 years. He graduated from the British-run Bishop Gobat school in Jerusalem in 1940. In the early 1950s, he headed the local branch of the Holy Land Mission, an American Presbyterian-backed charity. As the owner of a string of shops selling olivewood and mother-of- pearl souvenirs, he was appointed to Bethlehem town council under Jordanian rule in 1960. He remained on the council when Israel occupied the West Bank in the 1967 war, which had been previously occupied by Jordan in the aftermath of 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Elias Freij He was named and has been set up as a mayor in May 1972 by actual elected and winner Ibrahim Salim Abu-Hmud with 1181 votes, in the second place Ayyoub Musallam with 1007 votes and Elias Freij in third place with 998 votes, in 1976 he was elected. Israel then banned all further municipal elections and Freij remained in office until he stepped down on health grounds in May 1997. He was the only elected Palestinian mayor not deposed by the Israeli military authorities for pro-Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leanings. He was also the only non-PLO mayor to remain in office after the Palestinian National Authority was established. Despite his independence from the PLO, he was part of the PLO delegation to the Madrid Conference of 1991 and was a close confidant of Yassir Arafat.https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/30/world/elias-freij-80-mayor-of- bethlehem-for-25-years.html During his long period in office he made use of his international contacts to gain financial support for infrastructure projects, including construction of schools, administration buildings and water supply projects. In his time, Bethlehem became a twin city with Athens in Greece, C√≥rdoba in Spain and Assisi in Italy. Freij was an influential local figure, becoming Chairman of Bethlehem University's Board of Trustees and President of the Chamber of Commerce. He travelled abroad frequently, and was a member of the Palestinian negotiation team to the Madrid Conference of 1991 and was appointed in 1995 as a Minister of Tourism and Antiquities in the Palestinian National Authority, a post he held until 1997. He died on 29 March 1998 in Amman, Jordan.

Bell jars are often used in laboratories to form and contain a vacuum. It is a common science apparatus used in experiments. Bell jars have a limited ability to create strong vacuums; vacuum chambers are available when higher performance is needed. They have been used to demonstrate the effect of vacuum on sound propagation. In addition to their scientific applications, bell jars may also serve as display cases or transparent dust covers. In these situations the bell jar is not usually placed under vacuum. Vacuum A bell jar operating below atmospheric pressure A vacuum bell jar is placed on a base which is vented to a hose fitting, that can be connected via a hose to a vacuum pump. A vacuum is formed by pumping the air out of the bell jar. The lower edge of a vacuum bell jar forms a flange of heavy glass, ground smooth on the bottom for better contact. The base of the jar is equally heavy and flattened. A smear of vacuum grease is usually applied between them. As the vacuum forms inside, it creates a considerable compression force, so there is no need to clamp the seal. For this reason, a bell jar cannot be used to contain pressures above atmospheric, only below. Bell jars are generally used for classroom demonstrations or by hobbyists, when only a relatively low- quality vacuum is required. Cutting-edge research done at ultra high vacuum requires a more sophisticated vacuum chamber. However, several tests may be completed in a bell jar chamber having an effective pump and low leak rate. Some of the first scientific experiments using a bell jar to provide a vacuum were reported by Robert Boyle. In his book, New Experiments Physico- Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects, (Made, for the Most Part, in a New Pneumatical Engine), he described 43 separate experiments, some of which were carried out with Robert Hooke, investigating the effect of reducing the air pressure within the bell jar on the objects contained within. = Sound propagation experiments = One of the most well known of these experiments involved placing a ringing bell inside the jar, and observing that upon pumping out the air, the ringing disappeared. This experiment demonstrated that the propagation of sound is mediated by the air, and that in the absence of the air medium, the sound waves cannot travel. This experiment is often used as a classroom science experiment, where the experiment is repeated with an item such as an alarm clock placed under a bell jar, and the noise of the alarm clock fading as the air is pumped out being used to demonstrate the effect. By additionally placing a microphone inside the bell jar and observing that the sound detected by the microphone reduces as the air is pumped out, the effect of absorbance of the sound by the glass of the jar itself can be excluded. A model of Joseph Priestley's bell jar containing a candle = Candle in a bell jar experiments = Another common experiment using a bell jar involves placing a jar over a lit candle, and observing that the flame goes out, demonstrating that oxygen is required for combustion. A common variation of this experiment is to place the candle and bell jar over water, and to observe that when the candle extinguishes, the water level will rise inside the bell jar. The explanation for this observation is that the heating of the air inside the jar by the candles causes it to expand, and when the candle has exhausted the oxygen supply and extinguishes, the air will cool and contract, leading to the water being drawn up to fill the space. A common misconception is that the water level rises to replace the consumed oxygen, but since the combustion reaction produces carbon dioxide gas as a product, this explanation is not correct. Joseph Priestley also used a candle and a mint plant placed beneath a bell jar in an experiment reported in Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air to demonstrate the effect of photosynthesis. The candle was initially lit, and then the bell jar placed over the two items, and once the oxygen had been consumed by the candle, the flame extinguished. However, the candle was able to be reignited a number of days later, demonstrating that the plant had produced the oxygen required. = Physiological experiments = Priestley also carried out experiments using plants and a mice beneath a bell jar. He found that whilst a mouse kept alone inside a bell jar eventually died, when a plant was also placed inside the jar the mouse would survive. Boyle also studied the effect of removing the air from bell jars containing a number of different animals including insects, mice, birds and fish and observed the how they reacted when the air was removed. In \\"Experiment 40\\", from New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects, (Made, for the Most Part, in a New Pneumatical Engine) he tested the ability of insects to fly under reduced air pressure, whilst in \\"Experiment 41,\\" he demonstrated the reliance of living creatures on air for their survival. The oil painting An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump depicts a natural philosopher repeating a similar experiment to that of Boyle with a bird inside a bell jar. = Risks = A vacuum produces a pressure difference of one atmosphere, approximately 14 psi, over the surface of the glass. The energy contained within an implosion is defined by the pressure difference and the volume evacuated. Flask volumes can change by orders of magnitude between experiments. Whenever working with liter sized or larger flasks, chemists should consider using a safety screen or the sash of a flow hood to protect them from shards of glass, should an implosion occur. Glassware can also be wrapped with spirals of tape to catch shards, or wrapped with webbed mesh more commonly seen on scuba cylinders. Glass under vacuum becomes more sensitive to chips and scratches in its surface, as these form strain accumulation points, so older glass is best avoided if possible. Impacts to the glass and thermally induced stresses are also concerns under vacuum. Round bottom flasks more effectively spread the stress across their surfaces, and are therefore safer when working under vacuum. Decorative or preservative A modern day decorative glass bell jar containing a succulent Purely decorative bell jars were commonly used in the Victorian period to display and serve as transparent dust covers and display cases for a wide variety of items, including clocks, taxidermy, shells, and wax flowers and fruit. Decorative bell jars were made of thin glass, with more care being taken regarding their optical clarity, and they did not have a thickened base flange. For this reason, they are not suitable for vacuum use and would usually fail if pumped down. Similar glass domes were used as cheese domes or garden cloches.

McCreary covers an area of 1.70 km, and has a population of 472. Though settled as early as the 19th century, it was incorporated as a village in 1964, and amalgamated with the Municipality of McCreary in 2015. As the self-proclaimed Ski Capital of Manitoba, the former village previously held significance as the closest settlement to the former Mount Agassiz Ski Area.  History  McCreary was named for the surrounding Municipality of McCreary. Both the former village and municipality share the name with the local post office, which adopted the name in 1899 from William McCreary. It was incorporated as a village in 1964, but was amalgamated into the municipality in 2015.  Geography  McCreary is located in the Parkland region of Manitoba. It is located on flat prairie land, but lies immediately east of Riding Mountain National Park. = Climate = McCreary has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with cold winters and warm summers. Average daytime temperatures range from in July to in January. McCreary gets an average of precipitation annually, noticeably wetter than other areas of the Parkland region. There is measurable rainfall 80.1 days of the year on average, and measurable snowfall 46.9 days of the year.  Demographics  As of the 2011 Canadian census, the population of McCreary was 472, a 3.1% decrease from the 2006 census, in which the population was 487. The median age was 58.1 years old, 17.5 years older than the national average of 40.6. There were 250 private dwellings, 228 of which were occupied. English is the main language used in McCreary, being spoken fluently by virtually all of the population. In terms of Canada's official languages, 92.1% of the population speaks exclusively English, while 6.8% also speaks French. Other languages spoken as a mother tongue include Ukrainian (3.4%), German (2.2%), Tagalog (1.1%), and Ojibwe (1.1%), though only Ukrainian sees regular use at home, by 1.1% of the population. Of those in McCreary aged 15 or over, 60.5% are married or living with a common-law partner, 17.3% have never been married, 2.5% are separated, 6.2% are divorced, and 13.6% are widowed.  Attractions  = Recreation = McCreary was formerly known for the nearby Mount Agassiz Ski Area at Riding Mountain National Park, which opened in 1961, and renovated for the 1979 Canada Winter Games at the cost of nearly $500,000. Despite previously holding the position as the only ski \\"mountain\\" (as opposed to valley) in Canada between Thunder Bay and the Rocky Mountains, Mount Agassiz closed in 2000 after its owner's bankruptcy. Attempts to re-open Mount Agassiz as recent as 2015 with the purpose of reviving tourism in the area fell through, and the old structures at the site have been demolished, though Parks Canada is still taking proposals for the site. In contemporary times, the former village still features some public recreational facilities, including a tennis court shared with McCreary School, a curling arena, three baseball diamonds and a swimming pool. Though McCreary now lacks facilities for downhill skiing, several trails for cross-country skiing are available in the winter. = Culture = The Burrows Trail Arts Council has provided professional performances, visual art exhibitions, workshops and classes to the area including McCreary since 1986. It was named for the historical Burrows Trail that ran through McCreary. The McCreary and District Library rotates with the collections of other libraries included in the Parkland Library Service, and contains over 15,000 volumes, as well as mobile and local art collections and two public computers with Internet service.  Sports  McCreary played a role in the 1979 Canada Winter Games, as some events were held at the nearby Mount Agassiz Ski Area. McCreary Centennial Arena is a predominant outlet for sports in the area, hosting ice hockey teams under Hockey Manitoba, as well as broomball teams. McCreary is also known for its history in the sport of curling.  Government  McCreary, being amalgamated with the surrounding municipality, is represented by a council consisting of a reeve and six councillors. The present reeve, Larry McLauchlan, was elected to office in 2015, and previously served as reeve of the former Rural Municipality of McCreary from 2007. The remaining council consists of councillors Clayton Kohlman, Allan Whyte, Dave Smith, Linda Cripps, Shawn Buchanan, and Coreen Roy. Before its amalgamation, McCreary was represented by a mayor from the time of its incorporation in 1964. The former village lies within the federal riding of Dauphin‚ÄîSwan River‚ÄîNeepawa, which is represented by MP Robert Sopuck, a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. Provincially, it lies within the riding of Agassiz, which is represented in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly by MLA Stu Briese, a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba.  Transportation  Historically, passenger and mail service in the area was available by stagecoach from 1891 until 1903. The service ran along the Burrows Trail, an early north-south thoroughfare through the Parkland area that was constructed by the federal government to facilitate settlement of the region. Motorized taxi service began in 1910, and in starting in 1929, the village was serviced by a bus from Winnipeg that stopped at towns along Manitoba Highway 5. The village was served by the Canadian National Railway from 1912 to 1982. While the village is no longer serviced by CN, the station remains intact today as a historical site. In contemporary times, the area is served by Via Rail passenger train service, as well as McCreary Airport, a small public airport with one turf runway and a hangar. The airport has seen use from government agencies, skiers and pleasure pilots. McCreary is located along Manitoba Highway 5, which connects it to the Parkland region's largest centre, Dauphin, to the northwest, as well as Neepawa, to the south. It also marks the beginning of Manitoba Highway 50, which allows access from the former village to several communities along the western shore of Lake Manitoba.  Education  McCreary is part of the Turtle River School Division, and has one public school, McCreary School. The school has 126 students in grades K-12, and offers academic and vocational classes.

It was founded in 1974 by a coalition of peace groups. It has been involved in several campaigns, including a high-profile legal challenge against the Serious Fraud Office's decision to suspend a corruption investigation into BAE Systems in 2007. On 27 September 2012, it was honoured with a Right Livelihood Award for its \\"innovative and effective campaigning\\". Research Campaigns are founded on research into the arms trade and arms companies, and their relationship with the UK government and military, through political, financial and military support. The focus is on arms exports, although they recognise that there is a close relationship with military procurement. The research places particular emphasis on debunking myths and exposing hidden features of the arms trade, and large government subsidies given to the arms industry, largely through government research and development but also through export credits, government promotion and military attaches. In 2011, it commissioned the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute to calculate the costs of these subsidies - the figure it arrived at was ¬£698 million annually. The campaign has published briefings on the arms trade, including An introduction to the Arms Trade - An introduction to the impact of the arms trade, how it works, and the main justifications for the arms trade (latest edition April 2011) and Private gain, public pain - The case for ending the Government's arms selling and shutting the UKTI's Defence & Security Organisation (May 2010). It publishes a quarterly magazine, CAATnews, which is sent to supporters. The website contains information about the arms trade, arms companies and campaigning material. A relatively recent addition is an Arms Trade App, which reveals in an accessible format the details of UK \\"strategic export\\" licences, including military equipment, issued by the Export Control Organisation of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. This makes previously difficult or inaccessible information available to public view and CAAT sees it as a valuable campaigning tool in helping to hold the government to account. In 2013, in collaboration with the European Network Against Arms Trade, they launched a European Union Arms Export Browser which breaks down the complex data in the EU annual reports on arms exports in an accessible manner, by year, supplier country, destination country and types of military hardware. History It has adopted and adapted different campaign targets and slogans. From 2011 the main campaign slogan has been \\"This is NOT OK\\". The Arab Spring of 2011 vindicated CAAT's focus on UK weapons sales to authoritarian regimes in the region, and helped to give the campaign greater visibility in the media and with the public. =Control BAE= BAE Systems formerly British Aerospace, is the world's second largest arms company. BAE's arms are sold around the world. It has military customers in over 100 countries and in 2010 it was listed by SIPRI as having 95% of its sales as military. CAAT has long campaigned against BAE, highlighting allegations of corruption and political influence, rebuking claims about jobs, attending AGMs as critical shareholders, and through legal action. Saudi Arabia and other corruption inquiries In September 1985 BAE was a signatory to the UK's largest ever arms deal, the Al Yamamah contract to sell and service military planes to the government of Saudi Arabia. This ongoing contact has evolved through several phases and by 2006 had brought them ¬£43 billion.O'Connell, Dominic. \\"BAE cashes in on ¬£40bn Arab jet deal\\", The Sunday Times, News International, 20 August 2006 Shortly after the contract was signed, corruption allegations emerged concerning bribes paid to Saudi officials through a ¬£60 million pound slush fund. On 12 September 2003 the Serious Fraud Office began an investigation into possible corruption. There were also SFO investigations in BAE dealings in Chile, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria, Qatar, Romania, South Africa and Tanzania. However, on 14 December 2006 the Government, under the personal intervention of Prime Minister Tony Blair, discontinued the Al Yamamah probe on the grounds that its conclusions might embarrass the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and threaten Britain's national security. The campaign, in conjunction with The Corner House, mounted a legal challenge to this decision, to assess if in curtailing the investigation the Government had acted illegally. On 9 November 2007 the High Court granted the request for judicial review of the decision. Subsequently, on 10 April the High Court ruled that the Government had acted illegally in stopping the corruption investigation. Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Sullivan ruled that the Government had capitulated under intimidation from the government of Saudi Arabia and that \\"no-one whether within this country or outside, is entitled to interfere with the course of justice.\\" BAE Systems continued to deny any impropriety stating the court had failed \\"to distinguish between a commission and a bribe.\\" Subsequently, the Serious Fraud Office launched an appeal that was heard before the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords on 7‚Äì8 July 2008. On 30 July the House of Lords overturned the High Court ruling, and decreed that the SFO had acted lawfully in the interest of national security. Lord Bingham stated that \\"the director's decision was one he was lawfully entitled to make\\". The ruling attracted widespread condemnation. Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, characterised the verdict as \\"a legal licence for international blackmail.\\" Symon Hill commented: \\"BAE and the government will be quickly disappointed if they think that this ruling will bring an end to public criticism. Throughout this case we have been overwhelmed with support from people in all walks of life. There has been a sharp rise in opposition to BAE's influence in the corridors of power. Fewer people are now taken in by exaggerated claims about British jobs dependent on the arms trade. The government has been judged in the court of public opinion.\\" On 1 October 2009 the Serious Fraud Office announced that it would seek to prosecute BAE over bribery allegations in four countries: the Czech Republic, Romania, South Africa and Tanzania,. However, in the following months no moves were made to take the case forward and in a shock move, on 5 February 2010, they announced a \\"plea bargain\\" deal whereby BAE would pay ¬£30 million and plead guilty to failing to keep reasonably accurate accounting records in relation to its activities in Tanzania. No action would be taken in respect of the allegations with regards to the other countries. Simultaneously, BAE agreed a separate plea bargain with the US Department of Justice whereby it pleaded guilty to \\"conspiring to defraud the US by impairing and impeding its lawful functions, to make false statements about its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance program, and to violate the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations\\" and was fined $400 million. The campaign and The Corner House mounted a legal challenge to the decision by the SFO to accept the plea bargain on the grounds that they failed properly to apply prosecution guidance, including its own guidance. In particular, the plea agreement reached failed to reflect the seriousness and extent of BAE's alleged offending, which included corruption and bribery, and to provide the court with adequate sentencing powers. In response, on 1 March, the High Court granted an injunction prohibiting the Director of the SFO from taking further steps in its plea bargain settlement. However, the judicial review request was rejected on 24 March. In December 2010, Mr Justice Bean held a sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court. He was critical of the deal between the SFO and BAE and ruled that BAE was to pay a fine of ¬£500,000 and make a further ¬£29.5 million payment to the people of Tanzania. BAE delayed that payment, which was only transferred to the government of Tanzania on 15 March 2012, after severe criticism in the parliamentary International Development Committee. =UKTI Armed and Dangerous= United Kingdom Trade & Investment (UKTI) Defence & Security Organisation is the government's arms export promotion unit. It came into being on 1 April 2008 as a replacement for the Defence Export Services Organisation. The Defence Export Services Organisation was an adjunct of the Ministry of Defence concerned with procuring contracts for private military companies to export arms to foreign governments.UKTI Defence & Security Organisation website (Successor to DESO) The closure of DESO had been a core campaigning aim of CAAT since its inception in 1974 and was the principal campaign in 2006, focusing on arms sales to countries with poor human rights records (in 2004, UK arms export licenses were granted to 13 of the 20 'major countries of concern' identified by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in its 2005 Human Rights Annual Report). CAAT also alleged that DESO unfairly privileged the interests of arms companies and helped facilitate bribes to foreign officials. On 25 July 2007 Gordon Brown announced that DESO would be closed, a move condemned by Mike Turner, then Chief Executive of BAE Systems. Since its inception, UKTI DSO has held a privileged position in UKTI, employing more civil servants (160) at London headquarters than UKTI employs for all other industry sectors combined (130). There is no economic justification for such support: arms sales account for just 1.2% of UK exports and sustain just 0.2% of the national labour force. UKTI DSO is responsible for organising and supporting UK participation in arms fairs overseas and in the UKTi, especially the bi-annual Defence Systems and Equipment International (DSEi) in London and Farnborough International Airshow. The head of UKTI DSO is Richard Paniguian CBE, a former BP executive. UKTI DSO is based at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) in Westminster and also has staff in overseas offices in priority market countries. CAAT has held a number of protest demonstrations outside their offices and has made many Freedom of Information requests to UKTI DSO on markets, meetings and arms fair activities. =Arms fairs= It has long campaigned against government support and participation in arms fairs, in the UK and elsewhere. Arms Fairs promote weapons sales by giving arms dealers the chance to meet and greet military delegations, government officials, other arms companies and suppliers, and interested individuals. The guest lists for arms fairs frequently include regimes who abuse human rights, and countries actively involved in armed conflicts. Defence Systems and Equipment International DSEi is one of the largest arms fairs in the world. It is held at the ExCel Centre in London's docklands bi-annually. From 2003 to May 2008 it was organised by Reed Elsevier, a publishing and information company, who acquired the previous organisers Spearhead in 2003. CAAT campaigned to encourage Reed Elsevier to extricate itself from the arms industry. It directed a sustained and concerted effort from academics, doctors and writers who used the company's products, who demanded that Reed Elsevier end their involvement with arms fairs on ethical grounds. This culminated in Reed's decision to sell its arms fairs to Clarion Events in June 2007, a sale which was completed in May 2008. Since 2008 CAAT has campaigned against both UKTI DSO and Clarion Events' involvement in DSEi. In collaboration with Stop the Arms Fair coalition, they organised demonstrations against DSEi in 2009 and 2011 focusing its efforts in central London as security made it difficult to protest near ExCel. There have also been many smaller demonstrations outside Clarion Events offices and trade fairs, such as The Baby Show and Spirit of Christmas. Because Clarion, unlike Reed Elsevier, is a private company it is not possible to organise shareholder opposition; instead the focus has been on making exhibitors and visitors aware of Clarion's arms trade connections. The campaign has also tried to raise public awareness of the role of the Farnborough Airshow as an arms fair, owned and organised by the arms industry body Aerospace, Defence and Security (ADS). =Disarm the Gallery= The \\"Disarm the Gallery\\" campaignDisarm the Gallery was launched by CAAT and the Stop the Arms Fair coalition in 2012. It aims to persuade the National Gallery to end the ¬£30,000 annual sponsorship by Italian arms company Finmeccanica which has allowed the company to hold receptions for arms company executives attending arms fairs DSEi and Farnborough International. In October 2012, the Finmeccanica sponsorship was terminated, one year earlier than it had been due to expire. Other issues =Clean Investment= It has consistently sought to highlight public organizations (local councils, pension funds, charities, educational institutions, health bodies, religious organizations etc.) who hold shares in companies trading in arms and encourage them to disinvest. From 1995 to 2007 they researched and published annual reports on the arms company shareholdings of local authorities. In July 2007 they released research that 75 local authorities in the UK held such investments through their pension funds. It argued that many council employees did not want to invest in the arms industry and would prefer a more ethical investment strategy. The Clean Investment campaign has had many successes. In 2001, after a campaign by the CAAT Christian Network, the Church of England redefined its investment criteria and confirmed it would no longer invest in arms companies. With its arms-free portfolio, the Church was judged in 2005 to be the second best performer of more than 1,000 funds over the previous decade. The CAAT Universities Network has met with considerable success in its campaign for ethical investment in educational institutions. A 2007 report,'Study War No More', highlighted military funding and involvement in 26 British universities. CAAT supports student research into university investment portfolios which has helped students to mount their own campaigns for clean investment. As a result, many universities have disinvested their arms industry shares, while campaigns continue on other campuses for similar action to be taken. The campaign no longer actively researches or publishes on Clean Investment. Instead it encourages supporters to gain information on public bodies through the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and to use this information to support disinvestment. =Corporate mercenaries= Since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the use of 'private military companies' has become standard practice for countries such as the UK and the US. The campaign considers these contractors to be modern-day corporate mercenaries, as defined by the Geneva Convention. Private military companies have become big business, with an estimated turnover worldwide of $100 billion in 2003, and their use is likely to rise in future conflicts. CAAT published a research paper on the issue in 1999. It seeks an end to all mercenary activities. If this cannot be achieved at this point, they believe that they should be strictly regulated and has collaborated with War on Want and other organisations to lobby the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office to do so. In 2008, Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband rejected a government licensing system and proposed regulation by a trade organisation. The Coalition government accepted the Labour government's proposals and in March 2011 stated that ADS Group, representing over 2,000 companies in the AeroSpace, Defence and Space sectors, would oversee the regulation. CAAT does not find this form of self-regulation to be strong or impartial. Structure and funding The campaign's ultimate decision-making body is its steering committee, of elected and appointed members and staff members. It employs a small number of paid staff who are supported by a large number of volunteers, without whom the campaign would not be able to function. There is a network of local groups and contacts who play a vital role in communicating its message and strengthening its campaigns. There are two special interest networks ‚Äì the Christian Network and the Universities Network. Supporters receive copies of CAATnews quarterly magazine, mailings and ebulletins and are invited to attend an annual gathering, regional workshops and protests. Individuals and supportive groups (local branches of peace organisations, trade unions, churches, etc.) donate around 80% of the running costs. As a campaigning organisation, it is unable to take advantage of many of the benefits open to charities, but makes applications for charitable funding to a small number of trusts and foundations for its research and educational work. It is a member of the European Network Against Arms Trade (ENAAT) and works together with similar organisations in other countries.

The siege was one of the bloodiest in the Napoleonic WarsWeller p 204 and was considered a costly victory by the British, with some 4,800 Allied soldiers killed or wounded in a few short hours of intense fighting during the storming of the breaches as the siege drew to an end. Enraged at the huge number of casualties they suffered in seizing the city, the troops broke into houses and stores consuming vast quantities of alcohol with many of them then going on a rampage, threatening their officers and ignoring their commands to desist, and even killing several.Paget p 151 It took three days before the men were brought back into order. When order was restored, an estimated 200-300 civilians had been killed or injured.It has been variously stated that 4,000 civilians had been killed or injured, however no reliable primary sources have been cited to confirm this number.\\"Siege of Badajoz\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Siege After capturing the frontier towns of Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo in earlier sieges, Wellington's army moved south to Badajoz to capture this frontier town and secure the lines of communication back to Lisbon, the primary base of operations for the allied army. Badajoz was garrisoned by some 5,000 French soldiers under General Armand Philippon, the town commander, and possessed much stronger fortifications than either Almeida or Ciudad Rodrigo. With a strong curtain wall covered by numerous strongpoints and bastions, Badajoz had already faced two unsuccessful sieges and was well prepared for a third attempt, with the walls strengthened and some areas around the curtain wall flooded or mined with explosives.Myatt p 79ff The allied army, some 27,000Paget p 149 strong, outnumbered the French garrison by around five to one and after encircling the town on 17 March 1812, began to lay siege by preparing trenches, parallels and earthworks to protect the heavy siege artillery, work made difficult by a week of prolonged and torrential rainfalls, which also swept away bridging works that were needed to bring the heavy cannon and supplies forward. On 19 March the French made a strong sally with 1,500 men and 40 cavalry which surprised the working parties and caused losses of 150 officers and men before being repulsed. Amongst the wounded was Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Fletcher, the chief engineer. By 25 March batteries were firing on the outwork, Fort Picurina, which that night was stormed by 500 men and seized by redcoats from Lieutenant-General Thomas Picton's 3rd Division. Casualties were high with 50 killed and 250 wounded, but the fort was captured. The French made several raids to try to destroy the lines advancing toward the curtain wall, but were repeatedly fended off by the famed British 95th Rifles while simultaneously being counter-attacked by line infantry. The capture of the bastion allowed more extensive siege earthworks to be dug and with the arrival of heavy and siege guns, breaching batteries were established. On 31 March the allies began an intense bombardment of the town's defences. Soon a maze of trenches was creeping up to the high stone walls as the cannons continued to blast away at the stonework. On 2 April an attempt was made to destroy a barrier that had been erected amongst the arches of the bridge to cause flooding that was hampering the siege. The explosion of 450 lbs of powder was only partly successful. By 5 April two breaches had been made in the curtain wall and the soldiers readied themselves to storm Badajoz. The order to attack was delayed for 24 hours to allow another breach to be made in the wall.Myatt p 93 News began to filter to the allies that Marshal Soult was marching to relieve the town and an order was given to launch the attack at 22:00 on 6 April.Paget p 150 The French garrison were well aware of what was to come and, in between the cessation of siege guns at 19:30 and the start of the assault at 22:00, protected the large breaches in the walls with harrows, caltrops, and chevaux de frise in preparation for the imminent assault.Wellesley p 32 Storm Siege of Badajoz General Sir Thomas Picton storming the Castle of Badajos. March 31st 1812 With three large gaps in the curtain wall and being aware of Marshal Soult marching to the town's aid, Wellington ordered his regiments to storm the town so at 22:00 on the 6th and the troops made their way forward with scaling ladders and various tools. Three attacks would be mounted. The first men to assault the breaches were the men of the forlorn hope, who would lead the main attack by the 4th Division on two of the breaches. The third breach would be assaulted by Craufurd's Light Division, while diversionary attacks were to be made to the north and the east by Portuguese while British soldiers of the 5th Division and Picton's 3rd Division would assault the Castle from across the river. Just as the main forlorn hope were beginning their attack, a French sentry was alerted and raised the alarm. Within seconds, the ramparts were filled with French soldiers, who poured a lethal hail of musket fire into the troops at the base of the breach. The British and Portuguese surged forward en masse and raced up to the wall, facing a murderous barrage of musket fire, complemented by grenades, stones, barrels of gunpowder with crude fuses and bales of burning hay to provide light. The furious barrage devastated the British soldiers at the wall and the breach soon began to fill with dead and wounded over whom the storming troops had to struggle. The carnage, rubble and loss of guiding engineering officers led Craufurd's Light Division to become confused; assaulting an outlying ravelin that led nowhere, the troops became mixed with those of the 4th Division. Despite the carnage, the redcoats continued to surge forward in great numbers, only to be mown down by endless volleys and shrapnel from grenades and bombs. The French could see that they were holding off the assault and that the British were becoming stupefied and incapable of further exertion. In just under two hours, some 2,000 men had been killed or badly wounded at the main breach, while many more men of the 3rd Division were shot down as they made their diversionary assault. Picton's 3rd Division managed to reach the top of the castle wall ‚Äì without Picton, who was wounded as he climbed a ladder to try to reach the top of the wall ‚Äì and found themselves secure within the castle but, as all entrances into the town were blocked up, could not immediately come to the assistance of the other divisions. Everywhere they attacked, the allied soldiers were being halted and the carnage was so immense that Wellington was about to call a halt to the assault when he heard that the soldiers had gained a foothold in the castle. He ordered that the castle gates be blown and that the 3rd Division should support the assaults on the breaches with a flank attack. The 5th Division, which had been delayed because their ladder party had become lost, now attacked the San Vicente bastion; losing 600 men, they eventually made it to the top of the curtain wall. Major Lord FitzRoy Somerset, Wellington's military secretary (and the future Field Marshal the Lord Raglan), was the first to mount the breach,Heathcote, p. 267 and afterwards secured one of the gates to enable access for British reinforcements before the French could organise a fresh defence. The town's fate was sealed with the linking up with men of the 3rd and 5th Divisions, who were also making their way into the town. Once they had a foothold, the British and Portuguese soldiers had an advantage. Seeing that he could no longer hold out, General Philippon withdrew from Badajoz to the neighbouring outwork of San Cristobal; he surrendered shortly after the town had fallen.Myatt p. 104 Aftermath British infantry attempt to scale the walls of Badajoz, the site of one of several horrific sieges conducted during the Peninsular War. Siege of Badajoz When dawn finally came on 7 April, it revealed the horror of the slaughter all around the curtain wall. Bodies were piled high and blood flowed like rivers in the ditches and trenches. Surveying the destruction and slaughter Wellington wept openly at the sight of British dead piled upon each other in the breachesFletcher, I. Badajoz 1812: Wellington's bloodiest siege and bitterly cursed the British Parliament for granting him so few resources and soldiers. The assault and the earlier skirmishes had left the allies with some 4,800 casualties. Numbers differ between 4,924 and 4,760. The elite Light Division had suffered badly, losing some 40 percent of their fighting strength. With success came mass looting and disorder as the redcoats turned to drink and reprisals. The wanton sacking of Badajoz has been noted by many historians as a particularly atrocious conduct committed by the British Army: many homes were broken into, property vandalized or stolen, Spanish civilians of all ages and backgrounds raped, and many officers shot by the men they were trying to bring to order. Captain Robert Blakeney wrote: > The infuriated soldiery resembled rather a pack of hell hounds vomited up > from infernal regions for the extirpation of mankind than what they were but > twelve short hours previously ‚Äì a well-organised, brave, disciplined and > obedient British Army, and burning only with impatience for what is called > glory.Myatt p 105 Despite this, some historians have defended the British soldiers' mass rape and murder by arguing that the aftermath could not have been avoided considering the ferociousness of the battle. Ian Fletcher argues: > Let us not forget that hundreds of British troops were killed and maimed by > the fury of the respective assaults, during which men saw their comrades and > brothers slaughtered before their very eyes. Should we really condemn them > for feeling some degree of bitterness, for wanting to vent their anger upon > somebody? The storming of a fortress is not the same as a battle where men > expect casualties to occur. But when a force was asked to storm a fortress > when practicable breaches had been formed, such casualties would have been > deemed unnecessary. Given the enormity of the task facing the stormers in > the Peninsula, I for one begrudge them none of their feelings of anger and > desire for revenge.Fletcher p.47 On the other hand, Myatt writes: > Presumably one can return to the laws of war which, imprecise though they > were, did at least suggest propriety of a surrender when a practicable > breach had been made, to which Phillipon might very justifiably have > retorted that practicable was not a recognisable description of breaches on > which two of the best divisions in the British Army had failed to make any > impressions, even though the extent of their effort can be measured by their > losses.Myatt p 107 After fifteen to eighteen hours Wellington finally issued an order that the sack of Badajoz should cease and ordered detachments to restore order beginning at 5 a.m. the next day.Oman, Vol.5, p. 261. It was some 72 hours before order was completely restored, however.Hibbert, Christopher. Wellington: A Personal History, Perseus Books, 1997, p.119, . Many British soldiers were flogged as punishment and a gallows was erected, though no one was hanged.Myatt p 106 The most detailed study of the effects of the British riot and looting of Badajoz is undoubtedly the one published in 1983 by Eladio M√©ndez Venegas from data collected in the Diocesan Archives of Badajoz. Research into the local archives have established that only about 300 families (between 1,200 and 1,500 people) had remained in the city. A document drawn up at the time by the priest of the Parish of Conception, which is signed ‚ÄòBances‚Äô, presents in two folios the detailed list, per street/per parish, of the civilian dead and injured. The conclusion is that the total could be as high as 250, possibly even 280. This number may seem small but it means that there could have been between 20% and 30% of the Spanish civilians who were within the walls of Badajoz were killed or injured.\\"Casualties during the Sack of Badajoz 1812\\". The Napoleon Series. In a letter to Lord Liverpool, written the following day, Wellington confided: > The storming of Badajoz affords as strong an instance of the gallantry of > our troops as has ever been displayed. But I greatly hope that I shall never > again be the instrument of putting them to such a test as that to which they > were put last night.Fletcher p 81 From an engineering view point, the requirement to undertake the assault in a hasty manner, relying upon the British bayonet, rather than scientific methods of approach, undoubtedly resulted in heavier casualties, as did the lack of a corps of trained sappers. The siege was to lead, within two weeks, to the formation of the Royal School of Military Engineering. The siege was over and Wellington had secured the Portuguese‚ÄìSpanish frontier. He could now advance into Spain, where he eventually engaged Marshal Marmont at Salamanca.

Grosmont Priory was established in the 12th century and closed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. The village was established in the 1830s when the Whitby to Pickering Railway was built, and grew as a result of industrial iron ore extraction, and in the 1860s the development of an ironworks led to further growth. Up to at least the 1850s the village was known as Tunnel. History The River Esk at Grosmont, west of the priory was the crossing place of the ancient structure known as Wade's Causeway. A priory was established in the early 13th century, but no major settlements existed until the industrial revolution (1830s) when the arrival of railways and demand for iron led to the creation of a new village \\"Tunnel\\" later named Grosmont, and to the establishment of an iron works. Before the industrial period there is evidence of iron ore extraction and iron working in the parish: a 15th/16th century ironworking site has been identified on the banks of the Esk close to the priory;, 15th/16th century ironworking site and a late or post-medieval iron forge existed in Smithy Holme Wood less than south-east of the present village;, Iron working site, Smithy Holme Wood and a post-medieval pit for ironstone extraction was located less than east of the village;, Post medieval ironstone extraction pit alum extraction and refining is known to have taken place near to the site of St Matthews church., Allum garth, former Alum production site =Grosmont Priory= Grosmont Priory was a Grandmontine religious house, one of three in England. It was established around 1200 when Joan Fossard and her husband gifted about of land in the Forest of Egton (Eskdale) to the order. A fire destroyed most of the priory in 1360. In 1394 the Abbot of Grandimont gained permission to sell the priory, which was acquired by John Hewitt. The priory continued until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s. At the time of dissolution the priory had four priors; a net income of ¬£12 2s 8d per year; its buildings included a church with a bell tower, chapter house, kitchen and lodgings. The priory was located on the banks of the Esk., Grosmont Priory (site of)Sources:  * An unrelated chapel on the banks of the Esk about south-west of the priory was dedicated to St Leonard or St Lawrence and possibly connected with the Abbey of Melsa., former Chapel site, St Leonard or St Lawrence =Tunnel, or Grosmont village= A canal was surveyed in 1793 from Ruswarp near Whitby passing through Grosmont, Beck Hole and Newton Dale to Pickering, but was not pursued. A railway connection from Whitby was considered in the 1820s, with lines either to Pickering or Stockton via the Esk valley; surveying began in the 1830s, followed by formation of a company to raise capital for a line to Pickering; an act of parliament for Whitby and Pickering Railway was obtained in 1833. In May 1835 a daily service began on the partially completed line between Whitby and the Tunnel Inn in Grosmont. The railway company constructed the village inn and post office (1835/6). horse railway tunnel Grosmonts furnaces by night, 7 October 1865 The opening of the railway in 1836 brought industrial development: four lime kilns were constructed by the Whitby and Grosmont Lime Company, supplied with stone from Pickering; and the Whitby Stone company exported ironstone mined in the Grosmont area and building stone. The first recipient of ore from Grosmont was the Birtley Iron Company in 1836. Growth of Grosmont around the railway, river bridge and the 'Tunnel Inn' was observed by Henry Belcher in 1836: The village was known as \\"Tunnel\\" early in its history.Ordnance survey. 1:10560, 1853 In 1839 a second iron mine was begun by Mr Berwick on behalf of the landowner, Mrs Clark. Competition from Scottish black band ironstone resulted in a loss of trade for the mines in 1842/3. An increase in demand for ore in the mid-1840s led to the Grosmont mines becoming active again. A contract from Bolckow and Vaughan for 36,000 tons over three years was made in 1846. The area became an important supplier of iron stone; supplying one third of the ironworks in northern eastern England by 1848. Discovery of large deposits of ore in north Cleveland in 1850 closer to the consumers reduced demand for ore from south Cleveland. Henry Belcher raised funds to construct St Matthew's Church which was established in 1842 at a cost of ¬£1,260. The York and North Midland Railway acquired the line in the 1840s and made improvements; at Grosmont a stone bridge, a new tunnel and a railway station were constructed. By 1859 Grosmont had developed into a small town, with a Literary Institute and a National School. By 1861 three ironstone mines, Whitby Stone Co, Birtley Iron Co, and Mrs Clarks' mine, were extracting 30,000, 10,000 and 30,000 tons of ore respectively per annum. In 1862 Charles and Thomas Bagnall started an ironworks, 'Grosmont Works' and two blast furnaces were built by 1863. The furnaces were diameter, high, each with a production capacity of 250 tons per week. Furnace gas was extracted by a refractory lined iron tube built into the top ('throat') of the furnace ‚Äì the gas was used to heat boilers, and hot blast stoves. The site was connected to the railway by a siding., Grosmont Iron Works (site of) The Bagnalls acquired the land containing the Whitby Stone Company's mines to secure its supply of ore, and built back to back cottages for their workers in the village. Mrs Clark's mines were acquired in 1864. In 1865 a railway connection at Grosmont westwards to Castleton was opened, completing a connection from Whitby to the north-east ports. Grosmont Iron Works, , view westward over railway station The ironworks employed about 500 people and produced about 40,000 tons of iron at its peak between 1865 and 1875. A brickworks was established in 1870, east of the railway line and ironworks, and north of the village., Former brick and tile works The village population reached a peak of 1600 in 1880; a village cooperative society and Methodist church were founded in 1867, a Working Men's Institute was established in 1871, the church of St Matthew was rebuilt and enlarged in the decade after 1875. A third blast furnace was constructed and began production in 1876. Several negative factors affected the works after the mid-1870s: a drop in iron prices of 75% in the late 1870s; difficulty in obtaining coal during a strike in the Durham Coalfield around 1879, and industrial problems at the works in 1880. The works closed in 1891, and were offered for sale and the buildings demolished in the early 1890s. As a result of its closure, the village population dropped to 872 by 1901. The works produced an estimated one million tons of slag. After closure the slag heaps were reprocessed to make road stone, and slag wool; reprocessing continued until at least the early 1930s. The brickworks expanded during the first decades of the 20th century: its chimney was built in 1902; and a Hoffmann kiln was constructed in 1923; the brickworks operated until 1957. Excluding the building of Ings Terrace in the post second world war period, there has been no urban expansion of the village since the 19th century.Ordnance survey. 1:2500, 1893; 1913; 1973. 1:25000, 2009 In 1963 the railway line to Pickering closed but was reopened by volunteers as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway in 1973.

Oriana's maiden voyage was from Southampton to Sydney in December 1960, during this voyage the Oriana was the first ocean liner to berth at the Fremantle Passenger Terminal. At 41,915 gross tons and with capacity for more than 2,000 passengers in two classes (first and tourist), Oriana was briefly the largest passenger liner in service on the UK to Australia and New Zealand route, until the introduction of the 45,733 ton SS Canberra in 1961. The Canberra could never match the Oriana for speed, however, the latter having achieved 30.64 knots during her pre-hand over trials in 1960 and held the Golden Cockerel trophy for the fastest ship in the P&O; fleet which she retained until she retired in 1986, when it was handed back to the Canberra (in spite of the fact that Canberra's speed had by then been reduced to 23 knots). On Canberra's final cruise the Golden Cockerel was handed over to the new MV Oriana when both ships were anchored off Cannes and sent boats out to perform the handover. In 1962, the Oriana collided with the , resulting in damage and an eventual court case with the United States government, Orient Steam Navigation Company v. United States. In August 1970, the Oriana caught fire while steaming out of Southampton. This serious fire occurred when the boiler room caught fire at the beginning of its journey across the Atlantic on its way to USA, New Zealand, and Australia. Repairs took more than two weeks. From 1973, Oriana was converted to operate as a one class cruise ship and from 1981 until retirement in March 1986 was based in Sydney. After a layup of two months at No. 21 Pyrmont Wharf, Sydney, the ship was sold and moved to Osaka, Japan, to become a floating hotel. The ship served as a floating museum at Beppu, ≈åita, from 1987 but this venture was ultimately not successful, and she was subsequently sold to Chinese interests in 1995. The ship served as a floating hotel and tourist attraction in Shanghai until 2002, when she was moved to Dalian. In 2004 Oriana was damaged in a storm. Repairs proved to be unfeasible, so she was towed to a ship breakers yard and dismantled in 2005. In 1995, the name Oriana was assigned to the P&O; Cruises ship MV Oriana.

Crosstalk is usually caused by undesired capacitive, inductive, or conductive coupling from one circuit or channel to another. Crosstalk is a significant issue in structured cabling, audio electronics, integrated circuit design, wireless communication and other communications systems. Mechanisms Every electrical signal is associated with a varying field, whether electrical, magnetic or traveling. Where these fields overlap, they interfere with each other's signals. This electromagnetic interference creates crosstalk. For example, if two wires next to each other carry different signals, the currents in them will create magnetic fields that will induce a smaller signal in the neighboring wire. In electrical circuits sharing a common signal return path, electrical impedance in the return path creates ' between the signals, resulting in crosstalk.LearnEMC Web Site: Common-Impedance CouplingK.-H. Gonschorek and R. Vick: Electromagnetic Compatibility for Device Design and System Integration, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg, 2009, , page 90 In cabling In structured cabling, crosstalk refers to electromagnetic interference from one unshielded twisted pair to another twisted pair, normally running in parallel. Signals traveling through adjacent pairs of wire create magnetic fields that interact with each other, inducing interference in the neighboring pair. The pair causing the interference is called the ‚Äúdisturbing pair‚Äù, while the pair experiencing the interference is the ‚Äúdisturbed pair‚Äù. ;Near-end crosstalk (NEXT): NEXT is a measure of the ability of a cable to reject crosstalk, so the higher the NEXT value, the greater the rejection of crosstalk at the local connection. It is referred to as near end because the interference between the two signals in the cable is measured at the same end of the cable as the interfering transmitter. The NEXT value for a given cable type is generally expressed in decibels per feet or decibels per 1000 feet and varies with the frequency of transmission. General specifications for cabling (such as CAT 5) usually include the minimum NEXT values. ;Power sum near-end crosstalk (PSNEXT) :PSNEXT is a NEXT measurement which includes the sum of crosstalk contributions from all adjacent pairs as an algebraic sum of the NEXT of the three wire pairs as they affect the fourth pair in a four-pair cable (e.g., Category 6 cable). The Superior Modular Products White paper states that the testing process for PSNEXT consists of measuring all pair-to-pair crosstalk combinations and then summing all of the values for each pair. The specification was developed to directly address the effect of transmissions on multiple adjacent pairs on the pair being tested and is relevant to all connecting hardware and associated communications cables. :Cabling bandwidth in excess of 100 MHz (Category 5 cable bandwidth) make consideration of PSNEXT more important as Gigabit Ethernet through Cat-6 uses all four wire pairs simultaneously and bidirectionally. The additional wire pair usage and growing bandwidth increases the need to keep NEXT in check. ;Far-end crosstalk (FEXT): FEXT measures the interference between two pairs of a cable measured at the far end of the cable with respect to the interfering transmitter. ;Equal level far end crosstalk (ELFEXT): ELFEXT measures the FEXT with attenuation compensation. ; (AXT): AXT is interference caused by other cables routed close to the cable of interest as opposed to signals contained in the same cable. In audio right In stereo audio reproduction, crosstalk can refer to signal leakage across from one program channel to another, reducing channel separation and stereo imaging. Crosstalk between channels in mixing consoles, and between studio feeds is a much more noticeable problem, as these are likely to be carrying very different programs or material. Crosstalk is an electrical effect and can be quantified with a crosstalk measurement. Crosstalk measurements are made on audio systems to determine the amount of signal leaking across from one channel to another. The Independent Broadcasting Authority published a weighting curve for use in crosstalk measurement that gives due emphasis to the subjective audibility of different frequencies. In the absence of any international standards, this is still in use despite the demise of the IBA. Good crosstalk performance for a stereo system is not difficult to achieve in today's digital audio systems, though it is hard to keep below the desired figure of -30 dB or so on vinyl recordings and FM radio. Other examples In telecommunication or telephony, crosstalk is often distinguishable as pieces of speech or in-band signaling tones leaking from other people's connections. If the connection is analog, twisted pair cabling can often be used to reduce crosstalk. Alternatively, the signals can be converted to digital form, which is typically less susceptible to crosstalk. In wireless communication, crosstalk is often denoted co-channel interference, and is related to adjacent-channel interference. In integrated circuit design, crosstalk normally refers to a signal affecting another nearby signal. Usually, the coupling is capacitive, and to the nearest neighbor, but other forms of coupling and effects on signal further away are sometimes important, especially in analog designs. See signal integrity for tools used to measure and prevent this problem, and substrate coupling for a discussion of crosstalk conveyed through the integrated circuit substrate. There are a wide variety of repair solutions, with increased spacing, wire re-ordering, and shielding being the most common. In full-field optical coherence tomography, \\"crosstalk\\" refers to the phenomenon that due to highly scattering objects, multiple scattered photons reach the image plane and generate coherent signal after traveling a pathlength that matches that of the sample depth within a coherence length. In stereoscopic 3D displays, crosstalk refers to the incomplete isolation of the left and right image channels so that one bleeds into the other - like a double exposure, which produces a ghosting effect.

This can be achieved through a number of ways with the most common form being crosstalk between proteins of signaling cascades. In these signal transduction pathways, there are often shared components that can interact with either pathway. A more complex instance of crosstalk can be observed with transmembrane crosstalk between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cytoskeleton. Crosstalk between signalling pathways One example of crosstalk between proteins in a signalling pathway can be seen with cyclic adenosine monophosphate's (cAMP) role in regulating cell proliferation by interacting with the mitogen- activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. cAMP is a compound synthesized in cells by adenylate cyclase in response to a variety of extracellular signals. cAMP primarily acts as an intracellular second messenger whose major intracellular receptor is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) that acts through the phosphorylation of target proteins. The signal transduction pathway begins with ligand-receptor interactions extracellularly. This signal is then transduced through the membrane, stimulating adenylyl cyclase on the inner membrane surface to catalyze the conversion of ATP to cAMP. ERK, a participating protein in the MAPK signaling pathway, can be activated or inhibited by cAMP. cAMP can inhibit ERKs in a variety of ways, most of which involve the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the inhibition of Ras- dependent signals to Raf-1. However, cAMP can also stimulate cell proliferation by stimulating ERKs. This occurs through the induction of specific genes via phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB by PKA. Though ERKs do not appear to be a requirement for this phosphorylation of CREB, the MAPK pathway does play into crosstalk again, as ERKs are required to phosphorylate proteins downstream of CREB. Other known examples of the requirement of ERKs for cAMP-induced transcriptional effects include induction of the prolactin gene in pituitary cells, and of the dopamine beta-hydroxylate gene in pheochromocytomal cells (PC12). A number of diverse mechanisms exist by which cAMP can influence ERK signaling. Most mechanisms involving cAMP inhibition of ERKs uncouple Raf-1 from Ras activation through direct interaction of PKA with Raf-1 or indirectly through PKA interaction with the GTPase Rap1 (see figure 1). PKA may also negatively regulate ERKs by the activation of PTPases. Mechanisms for the activation of ERKs by cAMP are even more varied, usually including Rap1 or Ras, and even cAMP directly. Figure 1: a possible mechanism of cAMP/PKA inhibition of ERK activation (MAPK pathway). cAMP activation of PKA activates Rap1 via Src. Rap1 then phosphorylates Ras and inhibits signaling to Raf-1. Transmembrane crosstalk Crosstalk can even be observed across membranes. Membrane interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and with neighboring cells can trigger a variety of responses within the cell. However, the topography and mechanical properties of the ECM also come to play an important role in powerful, complex crosstalk with the cells growing on or inside the matrix. For example, integrin-mediated cytoskeleton assembly and even cell motility are affected by the physical state of the ECM. Binding of the Œ±5Œ≤1 integrin to its ligand (fibronectin) activates the formation of fibrillar adhesions and actin filaments. Yet, if the ECM is immobilized, matrix reorganization of this kind and formation of fibrillar adhesions is inhibited. In turn, binding of the same integrin (Œ±5Œ≤1) to an immobilized fibronectin ligand is seen to form highly phosphorylated focal contacts/focal adhesion (cells involved in matrix adhesion) within the membrane and reduces cell migration rates In another example of crosstalk, this change in the composition of focal contacts in the cytoskeleton can be inhibited by members of yet another pathway: inhibitors of myosin light-chain kinases or Rho kinases, H-7 or ML-7, which reduce cell contractility and consequently motility. (see figure 2). Figure 2: the matrix can play into other pathways inside the cell even through just its physical state. Matrix immobilization inhibits the formation of fibrillar adhesions and matrix reorganization. Likewise, players of other signaling pathways inside the cell can affect the structure of the cytoskeleton and thereby the cell's interaction with the ECM. Crosstalk in lymphocyte activation A more complex, specific example of crosstalk between two major signaling pathways can be observed with the interaction of the cAMP and MAPK signaling pathways in the activation of lymphocytes. In this case, components of the cAMP pathway directly and indirectly affect MAPK signaling pathway meant to activate genes involving immunity and lymphocytes. Newly formed cAMP is released from the membrane and diffuses across the intracellular space where it serves to activate PKA. The catalytic subunit of PKA must bind four molecules of cAMP to be activated, whereupon activation consists of cleavage between the regulatory and catalytic subunits. This cleavage in turn activates PKA by exposing the catalytic sites of the C subunits, which can then phosphorylate an array of proteins in the cell. In lymphocytes, the intracellular levels of cAMP increase upon antigen-receptor stimulation and even more so in response to prostaglandin E and other immunosuppression agents. In this case, cAMP serves to inhibit immunity players. PKA type I colocalizes with the T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors and causes inhibition of T- and B-cell activation. PKA has even been highlighted as a direct inducer of genes contributing to immunosuppression. Additionally, the cAMP pathway also interacts with the MAPK pathway in a more indirect manner through its interaction with hematopoietic PTPase (HePTP). HePTP is expressed in all leukocytes. When overexpressed in T-cells, HePTP reduces the transcriptional activation of the interleukin-2 promoter typically induced by the activated T-cell receptor through a MAPK signaling cascade. The way that HePTP effectively inhibits the MAPK signaling is by interacting with the MAP kinases Erk1, Erk2, and p38 through a short sequence in HePTP's non-catalytic N terminus termed the kinase interaction motif (KIM)., The highly-specific binding of Erk and p38 to this subunit of HePTP results in rapid inactivation of the signaling cascade (see figure 3). Figure 3: even without activation by a ligand bound to the receptor (R1), the MAPK pathway normally shows basal activity (at low levels). However, HePTP counteracts this activity. Yet, since both HePTP and Erk are cytosolic enzymes, it is reasonable to conclude that there exists a mechanism for the inhibition of Erk by HePTP to cease in order to allow for the translocation of activated Erk to the nucleus. Indeed, like in many other cases of protein- protein interaction, HePTP appears to be phosphorylated by Erk and p38 at the sites Thr45 and Ser72. Importantly though, a third phosphorylation site in the non-catalytic N terminus (the KIM region) of HePTP has been found‚Äîone that is phosphorylated to a much higher stoichiometry by the cAMP pathway, in yet another instance of crosstalk between the cAMP and MAPK pathways. Phosphorylation of this third site by PKAs from the cAMP pathway inhibits binding of MAP kinases to HePTP and thereby upregulates the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. The MAPK pathway, through Ras, Raf, Mek, and Erk, shows low activity in the presence of unphosphorylated (active) HePTP. However, activation the cAMP pathway stimulates the activation of PKA, which in turn phosphorylates HePTP at Ser23. This prevents HePTP from binding to Erk and frees the MAPK pathway from inhibition, allowing downstream signaling to continue (see figure 4). Figure 4: activation of the cAMP pathway by binding of ligand to its appropriate receptor (R2) leads to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by adenylate cyclase (AC). This activated PKA then phosphorylates HePTP at Ser23, inhibiting its ability to bind to Erk and subsequently inhibit the MAPK pathway. Moreover, studies involving smooth muscle cells from the atrium of the heart have shown that PKA can reduce the activation of MAP kinases in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by phosphorylating the kinase c-Raf. Thus, it seems plausible that PKA in the cAMP pathway could even be further involved in the regulation of lymphocyte activation not only by inhibiting the antigen-receptor MAPK signal pathway at its final stage, but even further upstream.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 821. The author of the rhyme is uncertain, but may be English poet Robert Southey (1774‚Äì1843). Lyrics Here is a representative modern version of the lyrics: > What are little boys made of? What are little boys made of? Snips and snails > And puppy-dogs' tails That's what little boys are made of What are little > girls made of? What are little girls made of? Sugar and spice And everything > nice [or \\"all things nice\\"] That's what little girls are made of The rhyme appears in many variant forms. For example, other versions may describe boys as being made of \\"snaps\\", \\"frogs\\", \\"snakes\\", or \\"slugs\\", p. 449 of the 1842 edition. rather than \\"snips\\" as above. Origins In the earliest known versions, the first ingredient for boys is either \\"snips\\" or \\"snigs\\", the latter being a Cumbrian dialect word for a small eel. The rhyme sometimes appears as part of a larger work called What Folks Are Made Of or What All the World Is Made Of. Other stanzas describe what babies, young men, young women, sailors, soldiers, nurses, fathers, mothers, old men, old women, and all folks are made of. According to Iona and Peter Opie, this first appears in a manuscript by the English poet Robert Southey (1774‚Äì1843), who added the stanzas other than the two below. Though it is not mentioned elsewhere in his works or papers, it is generally agreed to be by him.

The line included professional video cameras, video monitors and linear video editing systems. History Sony first demonstrated a wideband analog video HDTV capable video camera, monitor and video tape recorder (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in Algiers. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-1000 video recorder, with its companion HDT-1000 processor/TBC, and HDS-1000 video switcher all working in the 1125-line (this is an analog measurement defined by the number of horizontal lines, laid out from top to bottom, 1125-line would be equivalent to a digital resolution of 1875x1125.1125 divided by 3, and then multiplied by 5, due to the 5:3 aspect ratio, assuming square pixels) component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio. The helical scan VTR (the HDV-100) used magnetic tape similar to 1\\" type C videotape for analog recording. Sony in 1988 unveiled a new HDVS digital line, including a reel-to- reel digital recording VTR (the HDD-1000) that used digital signals between the machines for dubbing but the primary I/O remained analog signals. The large unit was housed in a 1-inch reel-to-reel transport, and because of the high tape speed needed, had a limit of 1-hour per reel. Sony, owner of Columbia Pictures/Tri-Star, would start to archive feature films on this format, requiring an average of two reels per movie. There was also a portable videocassette recorder (the HDV-10) for the HDVS system, using the \\"UniHi\\" format of videocassette using 3/4\\" wide tape. The transport housing similar in appearance to Sony's D1/D2 Standard Definition Digital VTRs, but recorded analog HD. The small cassette size limited recording time. The price of the HDD-1000 and its required companion HDDP-1000 video processor in 1988 was US$600,000. The metal evaporated tape (tape whose magnetic material was evaporated and deposited onto the tape in a vacuum chamber) costed US$2500.00 per hour of tape and each reel weighed nearly 10 pounds. The high price of the system limited its adoption severely, selling just several dozen systems and making its adoption largely limited to medical, aerospace engineering, and animation applications. Uses The Sony HDVS system is used in the production of a 5-min feature film about Halley's Comet in 1986, titled \\"Arrival\\", and shown in US theatres later that year, using 35mm film instead of tape. The first drama film shot using the HDVS professional video camera is RAI's Julia and Julia (Italian: Giulia e Giulia) in 1987, and the first HDTV television show was CBC's Chasing Rainbows, shot using the HDVS system in 1988. For the Genesis Invisible Touch Tour shows at Wembley Stadium in July 1987, the Sony HDVS system was used to film these shows and later released in VHS and LaserDisc in 1988 and DVD in 2003. World War II: When Lions Roared (also known as Then There Were Giants) is a 1994 TV movie, directed by Joseph Sargent, that stars John Lithgow, Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins as the three major Allied leaders. It was the first video production to be produced in the 1125-line high-definition television (HDTV) format. It was converted to NTSC for broadcast in the United States. The HDVS brand and logo is still used by Sony nowadays (as \\"Digital HDVS\\", since the original HDVS line of equipment from 1984 used wideband analog video to achieve the 1125-lines of resolution) on their current digital high-definition HDCAM-format cameras such as the Sony HDW-750 and HDW-F900.

Abstracting means that you don't exactly specify how the user interface is going to look, but rather what elements are to be shown, and how should they behave. For example, to describe a message window, you could write: In theory then you could use that description to generate user interfaces for different platforms, like PDAs. In practice, the different capabilities of those different platforms make a complete translation difficult. Other less ambitious domain-specific programming languages attempt only to describe the user interfaces (or other parts of the application or process) in a domain (for example Windows).

Prigrevica () is a village located in the Apatin municipality, in the West Baƒçka District of Serbia. It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The village is located 9 km east from Apatin. Population of Prigrevica counts about 3,964 people (2011 census), mostly ethnic Serbs. Name The village was founded about 600 years ago and it was recorded as Zenthyvan. In German it is known as Batschsentiwan or Sankt Johann an der Schanze (1763). Saint John the Baptist is considered the patron of the village. Its Serbian names were Sentivanprogrevica (recorded in 1772), and Prigrevica Sveti Ivan (recorded in 1893). In 1947, the name was changed to shorter form Prigrevica. History In the end of the 17th century the village became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. A new wave of colonisation occurred in 1748 when many German colonists settled in Prigrevica. The colonists came from many different regions in southern Germany and East France. The gathering centre was in Ulm, Germany and from that point they were transported by the Danube to Apatin, which became the main base of the German expansion in Vojvodina. When the Yugoslav Partisans came on October 24, 1944, they liberated Prigrevica from Axis occupation. AVNOJ declared its mainly German population as public enemies. Also in Prigrevica the German civil population became victim of excessive revenge of the partisans. They were partially shot, tortured to death or sent to one of several concentration camps that existed until 1948. After the Second World War, Prigrevica was settled by colonists who mostly originated from Lika and Banija.

He was instrumental in the revival of interest in Robert E. Howard's Conan stories and influenced the writing careers of L. Sprague de Camp, Fletcher Pratt, and other authors.De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"John D. (\\"Doc\\") Clark\\" (obituary) in Locus, August 1988, pages 64-65.  Life and career  Clark was born in Fairbanks, Alaska.\\"John D. Clark, 80, Rocket Fuel Developer\\" (obituary) in the New York Times, July 9, 1988, page 33. He attended the University of Alaska, and then the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, California from 1927-1930, graduating with a B.S. in Physical Chemistry. During his last two years at Caltech his college roommate was future science fiction author L. Sprague de Camp. He received an M.S. from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and, in 1934, a PhD from Stanford University. In 1933 Clark published a novel spiral chart of the periodic system of the chemical elements. This design was used by Life Magazine for a striking and influential illustration as part of a special number on the elements, 16 May 1949. It inspired the artist Edgar Longman, whose mural was a prominent exhibit in the Festival of Britain science exhibition, London, 1951. Clark came up with a new version in 1950, but this did not have the same success. Clark moved to Schenectady in Upstate New York in the early 1930s, taking a job with General Electric. A few years later he moved to New York City. He was living in Philadelphia and working as a research chemist for John Wyeth & Brother of that city in 1943. On June 7 of that year he married operatic soprano singer Mildred Baldwin.\\"Mildred Baldwin Bride: Opera Singer Wed to Dr. John D. Clark in Ceremony Here\\", in the New York Times, June 8, 1943, page 24. Their marriage later ended in divorce. From 1949 to his retirement in 1970, Clark developed liquid propellants at the Naval Air Rocket Test Station at Dover, New Jersey (after 1960, this became the Army's Liquid Rocket Propulsion Laboratory of Picatinny Arsenal). His title there was chief chemist. In 1962 he married artist Inga Pratt, widow of Fletcher Pratt.Contemporary Authors, First Revision, edited by Frances C. Locher and Ann Evory, entry on John Drury Clark, p. 91 He was the author of Ignition! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants (Rutgers University Press, 1972), based on his experiences in the field, which he dedicated to his wife Inga. It chronicles the development of liquid rocket fuel technology through both technical explanations of the work scientists performed and also anecdotes about the people involved and the often humorous incidents which took place. Copies of the original edition, now out of print, are rare and sell for over $400. In May 2018 Rutgers University Press began publishing Ignition! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants again. During the Clarks' married life they lived in an \\"unconventional\\" house in Newfoundland, in the Green Pond section of Rockaway Township, Morris County, New Jersey, where Clark continued to reside in his later years, until his own death. He died on July 6, 1988 after a long illness and series of strokes at St. Clare's Hospital in Denville, New Jersey, near his home. Clark's papers, consisting of four cubic feet of correspondence, drafts of scientific and science fiction publications, notes, an unpublished typescript memoir, diaries (1923‚Äì1984), clippings, and photos, are preserved in the Special Collections at Virginia Tech as part of that repository's Archives of American Aerospace Exploration.  Literary career and influence  As a fan of the science fiction and fantasy magazines of the pulp era, Clark became friendly with several figures who were or would become authors in both fields, including P. Schuyler Miller, Fletcher Pratt, and L. Ron Hubbard. He met Miller while living in Schenectady in the 1930s, and made the acquaintance of Pratt after moving to New York City. He later introduced de Camp to Miller, Pratt, and the informal circle of aspirant New York science fiction writers that included Otto Binder, John W. Campbell, Edmond Hamilton, Otis Adelbert Kline, Henry Kuttner, Frank Belknap Long, Manly Wade Wellman, and Jack Williamson. = Clark and Conan = Clark first encountered Robert E. Howard's fantasies of Kull, Conan and Solomon Kane in the magazine Weird Tales. He became an avid fan, and together with Miller he worked out an outline of Conan's career and a map of the world in Howard's invented Hyborian Age in early 1936 from the then-published stories. Miller sent this material to Howard, whose reply confirmed and corrected their findings. Their map became the basis of those that later appeared in the book editions of the Conan stories. Their revised outline, \\"A Probable Outline of Conan's Career\\" was published in the fanzine The Hyborian Age in 1938. Thus established as an authority on Conan, Clark was invited to edit and provide introductions for the first book editions of Howard's Conan stories, published by Gnome Press in the 1950s. Expanded versions of his and Miller's essay on Conan, retitled \\"An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian\\", appeared in the Gnome volume The Coming of Conan in 1953 and (revised by de Camp) in the fanzine Amra, vol. 2, no. 4, in 1959. It was the source of the linking passages between the individual Conan stories in both the Gnome editions and the Lancer paperback editions of the 1960s. Clark and Miller's Hyborian Age map, together with Howard's own original, are the basis of those published in the Gnome, Lancer, and later editions of the stories. = Clark and the science fiction community = While unemployed in the mid-1930s Clark wrote a couple of science fiction stories, \\"Minus Planet\\" and \\"Space Blister\\", with plotting assistance from L. Sprague de Camp, which were published in Astounding Stories in 1937. \\"Minus Planet\\" was the first science fiction story to deal with antimatter.Asimov, Isaac (1974) Before the Golden Age (Orbit 1976 edition, vol. 4) p. 181 When additional stories failed to sell he abandoned fiction writing while remaining active in science fiction circles. This experience did, however, prompt de Camp to launch his own career as a science fiction writer, first with short stories and then with a novel in collaboration with their mutual friend Miller. Clark furthered de Camp's career in another way by introducing him into Fletcher Pratt's war-gaming circle, and to Pratt himself, in 1939. De Camp and Pratt went on to write some of the most celebrated light fantasy of the 1940s, the Harold Shea and Gavagan's Bar stories. Clark also provided L. Ron Hubbard with the germ for his humorous fantasy novella The Case of the Friendly Corpse, published in the August 1941 issue of Unknown. According to de Camp, in the 1930s Clark and a friend named Mark Baldwin had \\"concocted a prospectus for an imaginary College of the Unholy Names\\", which Clark lent to Hubbard in 1941. Hubbard then built his story around the setting. Clark's first marriage led to the establishment of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, founded in 1944 by Pratt. As the new Mrs. Clark was reportedly unpopular with Pratt and others of his friends, the club gave them an excuse to spend time with him without her. The Trap Door Spiders later served as the model for Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the Black Widowers. Clark himself was fictionalized as the James Drake character. In 1952 Clark provided the scenario for and edited the Twayne Science Fiction Triplet The Petrified Planet, which has been described as \\"the first 'shared world' anthology\\". The scenario postulated a star system inhabited by silicon-based life forms, and was used as the basis for the three novellas by Pratt, H. Beam Piper and Judith Merril forming the body of the work. An excerpt from Clark's introduction (\\"The Silicone World\\") was reissued in the December, 1952 issue of Startling Stories, and the whole was reprinted in the 1983 Ace edition of Piper's contribution to the book, Uller Uprising. However, the Startling Stories excerpt has also been credited to Pratt, who supposedly utilized Clark's name as a pseudonym. Isaac Asimov, whom Clark first met in 1942, wrote the foreword to his book Ignition!

Founding guitarist Wally Gonzalez credits his fellow founding member, drummer Edmund Fortuno (a.k.a. \\"Bosyo\\"), as having introduced the band's name. In December 1970, the band was lauded for headlining the first open field rock festival in the Philippines. In 1971, they released their first album as a quintet, and thereafter gained momentum when it performed in a rock opera with the Manila Symphony Orchestra, the first production of its kind in the country. Juan de la Cruz reinvented itself in 1973 as a power trio and rose to stardom as the premier rock band in the Philippines. History =Up in Arms= The original Juan de la Cruz Band, consisting of Wally Gonzalez (guitar/vocals), Sandy Tagarro (bass guitar/vocals), Edmond Fortuno (drums), Bing Labrador (keyboards) and Alex Cruz (saxophones & flute), was formed in 1968.PinoyClassicRock.com In December 1970, they performed in the Antipolo Rock Festival (the Philippine equivalent to the Woodstock festival of 1969). They were subsequently tapped in September 1971 as the featured rock band in tandem with the Manila Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Redentor Romero) for the Philippine production of the rock opera by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, Jesus Christ Superstar, at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Consequent to his dramatic part as the Judas character in the rock opera production, Sandy Tagarro vacated his instrumentalist role in the group and was replaced by Clifford Ho as bassist. Upon the conclusion of the Jesus Christ Superstar production, Edmund Fortuno (aka \\"Bosyo\\"), Bing Labrador and Alex Cruz (with guitarist Vic Naldo and bassist Marlon Ilagan) formed a splinter group, Anak Bayan which, together with the Manila Symphony Orchestra, performed for another major production run at the Cultural Center, the rock opera, Tommy by The Who. The versatile Sandy Tagarro returned to the Juan de la Cruz Band, occupying the drummer's seat as Fortuno's replacement, and also as the band's lead vocalist; while Clifford Ho continued on bass. A musician from the Manila Symphony Orchestra (whom they had befriended in the Jesus Christ Superstar production), Romy Santos (flute/sax/clarinet), replaced Alex Cruz. Rene Sogueco (keyboards/vocal) was also recruited to replace Bing Labrador. In the wake of this major revamp, the Juan de la Cruz Band recorded its first album in 1971, entitled Up in Arms, which was released by Vicor Music Corporation under its Sunshine Records imprint. However, complications in the band caused Sandy Tagarro to leave abruptly barely after concluding the Up in Arms recording sessions; not even to pose for the album's photography. Consequently, the group picture for the LP's album cover showed a different drummer (Bobot Guerrero), with Tagarro's name stricken off the personnel credits, with exception to a parenthetical credit of him as composer of one song (\\"Lady in White Satin\\"). Bobot Guerrero's entry as the new drummer of Juan de la Cruz continued through the promotional run of the album and into concerts and club stints. The Up in Arms album was not a commercial success and had not been reissued by Vicor Music Corporation to date. An unauthorized compact disc translation of the LP (albeit excellently remastered and packaged) by Shadoks/Normal Music (Bonn, Germany) with spurious bonus tracks from a later edition of the band‚Äîis sold in online Internet shops. Wally Gonzales is showcased as a rock guitarist with progressive leanings in this early effort. In several months, keyboardist Rene Sugueco had also left (briefly replaced by Larry Martinez), and bassist Clifford Ho (briefly replaced by Tony Rodriguez). It was during this transition phase that Joey Smith had recently returned to the Philippines from a successful sojourn in Japan, and in 1973 had accepted a cameo singing role at the Cultural Center's \\"Little Theater\\" for an abortive rock musical (produced by Carlitos Benavides) based on Erich Segal's novel then in vogue, Love Story, in which the Juan de la Cruz Band was once again called upon to perform. This was also the period when the members of Juan de la Cruz and Anakbayan were freely associating and performing collectively as a \\"supergroup\\" ensemble in various concerts. Nidez aranzamedez, a notable rock drummer also jammed with the group and came up with the classic album the \\"Super Session\\". =Himig Natin= The state of Juan de la Cruz's flux and gradual dissolution led Wally Gonzalez to reconvene an all-new powerhouse trio, together with Joey Smith (later a.k.a. \\"Pepe Smith\\") as singer-drummer- composer; and with singer-bassist-composer Mike Hanopol. Smith and Hanopol collaborated in Tokyo with Japanese guitarist Shinki Chen in a \\"free-rock\\" trio setup called Speed, Glue & Shinki, which had released two seminal albums for Atlantic Records Japan. Rock music historian Julian Cope narrates in his book, Japrocksampler (Bloomsbury, 2007), that Shinki Chen had recruited Joey Smith (and later, Mike Hanopol) from a Filipino rock group called Zero History, which he found performing in Tokyo's mall district. (Wally Gonzalez was the guitarist of Zero History.) And thus the vibe of Speed, Glue & Shinki is noteworthy in the earliest contributions of Smith and Hanopol for the Juan de la Cruz collaboration, especially in the stop-start heaviness of \\"Take You Home\\" (A song by the american heavy psych group Fields, originally released in 1969, revived from the eponymous second album of S,G&S;), and the talking blues of \\"Blues Train\\". The ensuing album by the iconic trio of Gonzalez, Smith & Hanopol, unfurling its masterly title track, \\"Himig Natin\\" (English translation: \\"Our Hymn\\"), went on to become the anthem of Manila's post-hippie culture and underground radio network, particularly the DZRJ-AM radio show, Pinoy Rock 'n' Rhythm‚Äîlater on shortened to \\"Pinoy rock\\". The song is widely known as the first example of Pinoy rock. Himig Natin famously rallied Pinoy rock, which swelled into a movement and provided indicators of its yet- unrealized commercial fuel. The social impact and innovations of the Juan de la Cruz Band inadvertently became the catalyst for the inception of Original Pilipino Music (OPM) and the viability for diverse, originally-authored musical genres to emerge and thrive in the Philippines. Recent They were recently awarded the ASAP Pinoy Band's Special Lifetime Achievement Award on ASAP Natin 'To (formerly ASAP) in 2017 for their contributions to Filipino music as one of the greatest Pinoy rock bands in OPM rock history. Long time band guitarist Joey \\"Pepe\\" Smith passed away on January 28, 2019 at the age of 71.

The nom de guerre was perhaps utilized to circumvent a technicality that only unsigned bands were eligible to participate in the competition. They made two performances: at the Araneta Center (on an improvised stage behind the Smart Araneta Coliseum); and at 'Jam Park', a vacant lot leased for the multi-part event in the Makati area, situated alongside the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX). The nearly-reconstituted band consisted of Wally Gonzalez (guitar), Sonny Tolentino (bass guitar), Edmund Fortuno (drums), Bing Labrador (organ), Alex Cruz (saxophones & flute), with Jacqui Magno (vocals). Ironically, the group progressed only up until the semi-finals phase of the Battle of the Bands, after which they again disbanded.

The local theta correspondence relates irreducible admissible representations over a local field, while the global theta correspondence relates irreducible automorphic representations over a global field. The theta correspondence was introduced by Roger Howe in . Its name arose due to its origin in Andr√© Weil's representation theoretical formulation of the theory of theta series in . The Shimura correspondence as constructed by Jean-Loup Waldspurger in and may be viewed as an instance of the theta correspondence.  Statement  =Setup= Let F be a local or a global field, not of characteristic 2. Let W be a symplectic vector space over F, and Sp(W) the symplectic group. Fix a reductive dual pair (G,H) in Sp(W). There is a classification of reductive dual pairs. =Local theta correspondence= F is now a local field. Fix a non-trivial additive character \\\\psi of F. There exists a Weil representation of the metaplectic group Mp(W) associated to \\\\psi, which we write as \\\\omega_{\\\\psi}. Given the reductive dual pair (G,H) in Sp(W), one obtains a pair of commuting subgroups (\\\\widetilde{G}, \\\\widetilde{H}) in Mp(W) by pulling back the projection map from Mp(W) to Sp(W). The local theta correspondence is a 1-1 correspondence between certain irreducible admissible representations of \\\\widetilde{G} and certain irreducible admissible representations of \\\\widetilde{H}, obtained by restricting the Weil representation \\\\omega_{\\\\psi} of Mp(W) to the subgroup \\\\widetilde{G}\\\\cdot\\\\widetilde{H}. The correspondence was defined by Roger Howe in . The assertion that this is a 1-1 correspondence is called the Howe duality conjecture. =Global theta correspondence= Stephen Rallis showed a version of the global Howe duality conjecture for cuspidal automorphic representations over a global field, assuming the validity of the Howe duality conjecture for all local places. Howe duality conjecture Define \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\widetilde{G}) the set of irreducible admissible representations of \\\\widetilde{G}, which can be realized as quotients of \\\\omega_{\\\\psi}. Define \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\widetilde{H}) and \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\widetilde{G}\\\\cdot\\\\widetilde{H}), likewise. The Howe duality conjecture asserts that \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\widetilde{G}\\\\cdot\\\\widetilde{H}) is the graph of a bijection between \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\widetilde{G}) and \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\widetilde{H}). The Howe duality conjecture for archimedean local fields was proved by Roger Howe. For p-adic local fields with p odd it was proved by Jean-Loup Waldspurger. Alberto M√≠nguez later gave a proof for dual pairs of type II, namely pairs of general linear groups, that works for arbitrary residue characteristic. . For orthogonal-symplectic or unitary dual pairs, it was proved by Wee Teck Gan and Shuichiro Takeda. The final case of quaternionic dual pairs was completed by Wee Teck Gan and Binyong Sun.

Friedl√§nder's second communication on the micrococci of pneumonia, which appeared on 15 November 1883, touched off a controversy over the causative agent of pneumonia that continued for the next three years. In this second report he noted that he had examined more than 50 additional cases of pneumonia and that he had identified bacteria in nearly all of them and that sections from which the bacteria were absent were from the lungs of patients dying late in the course of the disease. Friedl√§nder also noted that it was necessary to use special stains (e.g. the Gram Stain) to see the bacteria because using ordinary stains (H&E;) nuclei and fibrin stained the same way as bacteria and thus obscured the ability to see the bacteria.Friedl√§nder, C. 1883 Die Mikrokokken der Pneumonie. Fortschr. Med., 1 (22):715-733, Nov. 15. As a result, Klebsiella pneumoniae is often called Friedl√§nder's bacterium or Friedl√§nder's bacillus.Kohler, W. & Mochmann, H.

Zeitschrift f√ºr √§rztliche Fortbildung 81(12):615-618 It is unclear if the bacteria that he observed in persons dying of pneumonia were truly all Klebsiella, some may well have been Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 1886, he introduced the ampoule in medicine. He died a premature death, aged 39 or 40, after a brief stint with a respiratory disease, believed to be caused by his discovered infectious organism, the Friedlander's Bacillus.

Dictyocaulus arnfieldi is the lungworm of horses, and Dictyocaulus viviparus is the lungworm affecting ruminants.  Dictyocaulus viviparus: lungworm of cattle, deer D. viviparus is the most common lungworm of cattle; the infection is also known as husk or parasitic bronchitis. Although classified as the same parasite, some people believe that the D. viviparus of deer and elk should be reclassified as a different species, including D. eckertii in New Zealand. However, both species have been shown capable of cross-infecting cattle and cervids (at least in New Zealand) . The parasite has a simple but interesting life cycle, with dispersal facilitated by a fungus. Adult D. viviparus worms reside in the bronchial tree of the animal's lungs. They lay eggs into the airways (bronchi). These eggs are coughed up and subsequently swallowed by the host. The eggs hatch into Stage 1 larvae (L1) in the gastrointestinal tract of the ruminant host. These L1 larvae are shed in the feces or manure. In the feces, larvae mature through two stages and become infective as L3 stage larvae. Cattle feces supports the growth of Pilobolus sp. fungi. The L3 larvae of D. viviparus invade the inside of these fungi, and wait in the fungal sporangium. When the fungus sporulates, the larvae are dispersed as much as 10 feet in a pasture. Cattle grazing then ingest the L3 larvae. These larvae go through the intestinal system and penetrate the intestinal wall. They use the lymphatic system to reach the mesenteric lymph nodes, where they mature once again into L4 stage larvae. The L4 larvae use the blood supply and the lymphatic system to reach the lungs, where they become adults. The life cycle is completed.  Symptoms of D. viviparus  Symptoms of D. viviparus can include coughing, rapid shallow breathing, expiratory dyspnea, tactile fremitus, serous nasal discharge, pyrexia, increased pulse rate, weight loss, and diarrhea.  Diagnosis of D. viviparus infection  # Microscope detection of L1 larvae in feces # Microscope detection of eggs or larvae in the coughed up sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from affected animal # Blood serology test for worm antigens (available in some countries / states)  Treatment of lungworm infections  Treatment of a D. viviparus infection should be considered if chances of reinfection are high. This would include situations with high stocking rates, longer grazing seasons, and grazing on pastures where infected cattle have grazed. If treatment is decided, ivermectin, albendazole, fenbendazole, febantel and other anthelmintics will target the lungworm. Pasture management should take into consideration the infectiveness of these organisms since the larvae can survive in the soil for extended periods of time.  D. arnfieldi in horses and donkeys  D. arnfieldi is similar to D. viviparus in cattle, but only affects equids. Donkeys usually show no disease and can be silent carriers (and shedders) of this parasite, which causes clinical signs in horses. Routine deworming of horses and donkeys may help prevent cross infection when kept together. Pastures that housed donkeys may be infected with lungworm larvae. As a result, horses and donkeys should not be grazed together. These drugs are given with three weeks intervals between treatments.

She is internationally known for convincingly combining elements of cubism (called by her \\"Dimensionalism\\") with pointillism and ‚Äì through the use of the Golden Ratio for laying out paintings ‚Äì structure. She has been accredited with being the first female cubist painter. Though she lived the greater part of her life abroad ‚Äì her formative years as a cubist painter in France and her mature years in England ‚Äì she is often referred to as a \\"Russian painter\\". From her relationship with the Mexican cubist painter and later muralist Diego Rivera in Paris she had a daughter, Marika Rivera (1919-2010), who became a professional dancer and film actress. Artist‚Äôs name Marevna was also known, depending on the preferred usage or transliteration, as Maria Marevna, Marie Marevna, Marie Vorobiev, Maria Vorobieva, Marie Vorobieff Marevna, Maria Marewna Worobiew, Marevna Vorob√´v, Marevna Vorobyev, Marevna Vorobieva, Marevna Vorobev-Stebelska, Marevna Vorobyov-Stebelska, Maria Vorobyova-Stebelskaya, Maria Bronislawowna Worobjewa-Stebelskaja, Maria Bronislavovna, Maria Rozanowicz-Vorobieff, and Rosanovitch Marevna Vorobiev. Reputedly, the nickname Marevna was given to her by Maxim Gorky after a Russian fairy sea princess. Growing up in Russia Marevna reputedly was born in 1892 in Cheboksary in the administrative district of Kazan in Russia as Maria Bronislavovna Vorobyova-Stebelskaya to the Polish nobleman Bronis≈Çaw Stebelski and the actress Maria Vorobyova. She spent a lonely childhood in Tiflis, now Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, then under Russian control. In 1910 she went to Moscow to study at the Stroganov Art Academy, but in the following year left for Italy. On the island of Capri she was introduced to Maxim Gorki who named her after a Russian fairy sea princess, Marevna, a name she adopted and made her own. A petite blue-eyed blonde, she was said not to have been a conventional beauty; but an outgoing nature paired with the proverbial depth of the Russian soul seems to have given her a special charm that easily elicited an enthusiastic echo from her contemporaries. Early career in Paris In 1912, as a twenty-year-old budding talent, Marevna moved to Paris, where she continued her art studies and soon began displaying her work at exhibitions. She became acquainted and, indeed, friends with some of the greatest artists and writers of the early twentieth century then resident in Montparnasse and especially at La Ruche. Among them were Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Jean Cocteau, Ilya Ehrenburg, Maxim Gorki, Max Jacob, Moise Kisling, Pinchus Kr√©m√®gne, Fernand L√©ger, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, and Chaim Soutine. Three years later, in 1915, the gifted Mexican painter Diego Rivera, also temporarily resident in Paris at La Ruche ‚Äì no Adonis but a known womanizer of violent temper ‚Äì began a relationship with her while he was still in a common-law marriage with the Russian artist Angelina Beloff, six years his senior and then pregnant with his only son Diego Jr., who was not, however, to survive for more than 14 months. Diego Rivera was nearly 30 at the time and by at the zenith of his cubist phase, having already exhibited his works at three exhibitions. Marevna herself discovered cubism as an eminently suited vehicle for her own talent, and is thought to have been one of the first female cubist painters. Despite Diego Rivera's assurances of his love for Marevna, their relationship ended soon after the birth on 13 November 1919 in Paris of their daughter Marika. A comparison of their respective subsequent work, also of Marevna's paintings with those of Diego Rivera's later wife Frida Kahlo, suggests that Marevna never quite lost sight of him. Nevertheless, for a time, until his tragic death, she was to find a kindred spirit in Chaim Soutine. \\"Homage to Friends from Montparnasse\\" (1962), of mural size yet painted long after she had left Paris, is a window into Marevna's heart, not only as regards Diego Rivera, but also Chaim Soutine and other Paris friends ‚Äì a little circle completely dominated by Amedeo Modigliani. Later career in England Marevna's and Diego Rivera's daughter Marika became first a dancer, then a film actress, and then also a playwright, using the name Marika Rivera. At her first wedding in 1938, Marika married the Provence painter Jean Paul Brusset, by whom she had a son, Jean Brusset. Subsequently, she married the owner of the literary periodical \\"Polemic\\", Rodney Phillips, who for the duration of their marriage owned Athelhampton House in Dorset/England (1949‚Äì1957), and by whom in 1949 she had her second son, David Phillips. Marevna lived with her daughter's family at Athelhampton. Her paintings from this time include a portrait of its owner ‚Äì her son-in-law Rodney Phillips ‚Äì and the stunning topiaries in its Great Court (\\"Pyramid Garden\\"). After the break-up of her daughter's second marriage, mother, daughter and the two grandsons moved to a significantly smaller though still sizeable property in Ealing, \\"the queen of the London suburbs\\", a few steps down the road from Ealing Abbey, a Roman Catholic Benedictine monastery and parish church. In Ealing Marevna \\"enjoyed some three more fruitful decades before her demise there in 1984\\".This was to gloss over the low points in the early 1960s. The Pushkin Club for Russian exiles in London arranged an exhibition of her paintings but the poor lighting and hanging made for a disaster and even at the rock bottom price of $60 there were no sales. In the Christmas Bazaar sale the club sold off her small watercolors for not more than $3. At home the household dogs had access to her storage and damaged her paintings. No money was available from her family for paint or materials nor was there even a room to paint in. She was fortunate enough then to meet Anya Teixeira at the Club. The latter bought her materials from her meager earnings as a clerk. These included the rolls of canvas from which the ultra-large pictures of her former colleagues in the Russian School of Paris painted. She successfully pleaded for Marevna to have the use of a large room to paint in so she could resume her career. Marevna died in London on 4 May 1984. Select list of paintings While unfortunately the contract for the work ended in court proceedings, the catalogue and online reproductions of over 100 pictures are available (for reference only) on the official site of Anya Teixeira for the years up till 1967. These slides undoubtedly helped the subsequent purchase of much of Marevna's work by Oscar Ghez, the Swiss collector.

And near this > hamlet the country people had so undermined a hill of sand, by digging it to > carry it into to their grounds, that a great quantity thereof fell down, > discovering the top of a tree, which by farther search was found to be > thirty feet in length, so that it plainly appeareth this circuit of marsh > land (now, of the sands overblowing, called the Burrows) was in elder ages > stored with woods and tall timber trees\\". Similar stories exist in respect of the south coast of Glamorgan, across the Bristol Channel, regarding the Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes which started shifting in the late 14th century and encroached on Kenfig Castle, resulting in its evacuation but which spared Candleston Castle, now almost surrounded by dunes. Civilian use A lifeboat station was opened on Braunton Burrows in 1848, although its crew always came from the established Appledore Lifeboat Station on the other side of the estuary. It was closed in 1918 as it was difficult to find men and horses to launch the boat following World War I. It is used, particularly by local people, for a range of leisure activities, particularly dog-walking, from three large car parks adjacent to the site. There is a long tradition of scientific research, particularly botanical. Tourism is an important use of the area in summer. The more isolated parts of the Burrows are noted for naturism. Military use Braunton Burrows played an important role during the Second World War. In 1943 Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Thompson was tasked with training the Americans for their assault on the heavily defended Normandy beaches. All good training ground had been claimed by the British and so Thompson had no choice but to accept the Atlantic coast near Braunton. The perimeter of the land he needed did in fact stretch south from Mortehoe Station to Braunton, and the River Caen to the Taw Torridge Estuary. Every acre was needed for exercise and for rehearsals using live ammunition, explosives, tanks, artillery and air support ‚Äì all of which became features of the US Assault Training Centre. The beaches here were ideal for amphibious exercises, despite the fierce Atlantic surf, and the nearby sands were soon found to be identical to Omaha in every respect ‚Äì including sand quality, beach gradient and tidal range. Anyone who has seen Omaha beach will instantly recognise an uncanny resemblance to Woolacombe and Saunton. Thompson was originally tasked with teaching the troops how to neutralise the enemy beach defences and then fight their way inland, although the second part of his mission was later relocated to Slapton beach in South Devon. Ranges for all weapons were required in order to help the troops practice and construction of such ranges and other aids had to be carried out quickly, as the first units arrived in North Devon on 1 September 1943. 6 Replica landing craft made from concrete can still be found at the southern end of the Burrows. As winter approached, a permanent camp was needed; most troops had been accommodated in tents until then. 505 Nissen huts were erected to house 4250 men. Some of the narrow country lanes were made one-way for ease of use and where no metalled roads existed temporary tracks were laid. One such track is the old ferry way, which extended from the south end of Sandy Lane across the back of the dunes to the White House near Crow Point. This road was widened and straightened and exists today as ‚Äòthe American Road‚Äô. The site is currently leased by the Ministry of Defence from the Christie Devon Estates Trust (see Tapeley Park). The area is closed for 10 days per year for military training. The fact that it is so difficult to navigate makes it ideal for land-based exercises, although the sandy conditions are useful to all disciplines. The Royal Air Force sometimes use Saunton Sands to practice STOL beach landing and take off with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The Royal Marines also occasionally use the beach to practice amphibious landings. Crow Point Lighthouse Situated at the south end of Braunton Burrows is Crow Point Lighthouse, which guides vessels navigating the Taw and Torridge estuary. Erected in 1954, the lighthouse is a small tubular steel structure, powered when first built by acetylene gas, then from 1978 by electricity and now by solar power following conversion in 1987. Modernised in 2001, it currently displays a sector light indicating safe passage in and out of the River Taw. It is operated by Trinity House. A much larger structure formerly stood, alongside the estuary, north- west of the current light: Braunton Lighthouse (also known as Bideford Lighthouse) consisted of an octagonal wooden tower built on top of keepers' accommodation, 86 foot high in total.High Light photo (Braunton Museum) There was also an associated low light.Low Light photo (Braunton Museum) The low light was 300 metres to the north-west of the main light; when the two were aligned, as seen from a vessel in Bideford Bay, they provided a bearing for the safe passage through the shoals in the estuary. The lower light was contained in a wooden shed mounted on a short railway running perpendicular to the shore, so that it could be moved to keep pace with the dynamically shifting shoals; for example, between 1820 and 1832 it had to be winched 34m to the north-east, while in the following twelve years it had to be winched back to the south-west by 90m. Both lighthouses were built in 1819 (the Low Light was rebuilt in 1832), both were painted white and each was lit by a single Argand light mounted within a parabolic reflector. In the 19th century the lights were tidal: rather than being lit all night, they were only displayed between half-flood and half-ebb, when they signalled safe passage over Bideford Bar (a notorious sand bank which renders entry into the Taw Torridge Estuary hazardous at low tide). From 1879 the High Light began to be displayed all night, regardless of the state of the tide;London Gazette, Issue 24747, Page 4701, 29 July 1879 and in 1889 it was made occulting (the light being eclipsed for two seconds every thirty seconds).London Gazette, Issue 25957, Page 4017, 26 July 1889 The Low Light remained tidal (later an additional red or green light signalled the state of the tide, and a spherical daymark was used during hours of daylight). In 1890 each lighthouse was painted with a vertical red stripe on the seaward side.London Gazette, Issue 26115, Page 7057, 16 December 1890 In 1945 the two lighthouse keepers were withdrawn as the ground under the High Light (where they lived) was becoming unstable. After the establishment of Crow Point Light, both the old Braunton lights were demolished in 1957 and a new pair of leading lights were erected east of the estuary, at Instow. Designations *UNESCO Biosphere Reserve *National nature reserve (part) *SSSI *Ramsar site *Special Area of Conservation *North Devon AONB *North Devon Heritage Coast Part of the site was de-declared as an NNR in 1996 because of a disagreement over grazing management practices between the landowner Christie Devon Estates Trust and English Nature. This de-declaration was a unique occurrence. Braunton Burrows forms the core area of North Devon's Biosphere Reserve. Scrub invasion Scrub invasion is managed to maintain a state of semi-equilibrium and prevent succession to a climax community. The methods of scrub management used have become a point of contention between the various parties involved with the site. During the 1970s invasion of coarse grasses were managed largely by rabbit grazing. The spread of myxomatosis resulted in rabbit population decline and consequent encroachment of species rich turf by scrub species such as privet Ligustrum vulgare and heather Calluna vulgaris. Decline in species diversity was exacerbated through the introduction of sea buckthorn Hippophae rhamnoides by the military. This attempt at dune stabilisation was implemented after preparations for the Normandy landings caused widespread erosion. Deep rooted species such as bramble, hawthorn and willow were also able to flourish and resulted in several sallow carr communities These species were maintained and species rich turf later established through a combination of management techniques. Braunton Burrows, August 2009 The burning of deep rooted species often made the soil more fertile but led to the spread of coarse grasses. These grasses were later managed by mowing in combination with grazing by soay sheep and cattle. Grazing was viewed by the Christies Estates Trust as exacerbating erosion and hence damaging to species diversity. The trust therefore opposed the introduction of sheep and cattle to the site. However English Nature felt that this turnover was erosive but nevertheless was less invasive than mowing. English Nature felt the turnover of soil increased species diversity and with the use of soay sheep, maintained a desirable balance to ecosystems. It was this disagreement that was the main factor which led to the de-designation of the site as a national nature reserve in 1996.

For broadcast transmission across multiple cells, it defines transmission via single- frequency network configurations. The specification is referred to as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) when transmissions are delivered through an LTE (Long Term Evolution) network. eMBMS is also known as LTE Broadcast.GSA: LTE Broadcast (eMBMS) Market Update ‚Äì January 2019 (retrieved 7 January 2019) Target applications include mobile TV and radio broadcasting, live streaming video services, as well as file delivery and emergency alerts. Questions remain whether the technology is an optimization tool for the operator or if an operator can generate new revenues with it. Several studies have been published on the domain identifying both cost savings and new revenues.  Deployments  In 2013,Verizon Eyes Broadcast Over LTE for Super Bowl 2014 By Chloe Albanesius, PC Magazine, January 8, 2013 Verizon announced that it would launch eMBMS services in 2014, over its nationwide (United States) LTE networks.

[ https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/verizons-mobile-video- service-go90-launches-to-public/] Verizon ceased operating the go90 service on July 31, 2018. In February 2016, Akamai demonstrated with Expway, delivery of video streams across LTE networks with live on the fly switching from unicast to broadcast, at Mobile World Congress 2016. In April 2016, Verizon, Telstra, KT and EE launched the LTE Broadcast Alliance. As of January 2019, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association had identified 41 operators that have invested in eMBMS (including those considering/testing/trialling, deploying or piloting and those that have deployed or launched eMBMS). Five operators state they have now deployed eMBMS or launched some sort of commercial service using eMBMS.GSA: LTE Broadcast (eMBMS) Market Update ‚Äì January 2019 (retrieved 7 January 2019) The range of chipsets available that can support eMBMS has been steadily growing, with three mobile processors/platforms released since March 2018. GSA has identified 69 chipsets supporting eMBMS, and there are at least 59 devices that support eMBMS (in some instances after operator-specific upgrades).GSA: LTE Broadcast ‚Äì eMBMS ‚Äì Snapshot July 2019  Competing technologies  Main competing technologies of MBMS include DVB-H/DVB-T, DVB- SH, DMB, ESM-DAB, and MediaFLO. However, due to spectrum scarcity and the cost of building new broadcast infrastructure some of these technologies may not be viable. MediaFLO has been deployed commercially in the US by Verizon Wireless through their relationship with MediaFLO USA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Qualcomm) however the service was shut down in early 2011.MediaFLO DMB and DVB-H trials have been ongoing for more than a year now, like those during the football 2006 championships in Germany. Huawei's proprietary CMB is a precursor to the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service. It was specified in 3GPP R6 and is using existing UMTS infrastructure. Huawei says that CMB is based on existing UMTS infrastructure and real time streaming application protocol. The most significant competition is from services that stream individual video feeds to users over uni-cast data connections. While less efficient in certain situations, particularly the traditional case where everyone watches the same stream simultaneously, the user convenience of individual streaming has taken over the vast majority of the mobile media streaming market.  Technical description  The MBMS feature is split into the MBMS Bearer Service and the MBMS User Service and has been defined to be offered over both UTRAN (i.e. WCDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) and LTE (where it is often referred to as eMBMS). The MBMS Bearer Service includes a Unicast and a Broadcast Mode. MBMS Operation On-Demand (MOOD) allows dynamic switching between Unicast and Broadcast over LTE, based on configured triggers. The MBMS Bearer Service uses IP multicast addresses for the IP flows. The advantage of the MBMS Bearer Service compared to unicast bearer services (interactive, streaming, etc.) is that the transmission resources in the core and radio networks are shared.Delivering content with LTE broadcast By Thorsten Lohmar, Michael Slssingar, Vera Kenehan and Stif Puustinen, Ericsson Review, February 11, 2013 One MBMS packet flow is replicated by GGSN, SGSN and RNCs. MBMS may use an advanced counting scheme to decide, whether or not zero, one or more dedicated (i.e. unicast) radio channels lead to a more efficient system usage than one common (i.e. broadcast) radio channel. * UTRAN MBMS offers up to 256 kbit/s per MBMS Bearer Service and between 800 kbit/s and 1.7 Mbit/s per cell/band. The actual cell capacity depends on the UE capabilities. * GERAN MBMS offers between 32 kbit/s and 128 kbit/s. Up to 4 GSM timeslots may be used for one MBMS bearer in the downlink direction. The actual data rate per Traffic Slot depends on network dimensioning. The MBMS User Service is basically the MBMS Service Layer and offers two different data Delivery Methods: * The Streaming Delivery Method can be used for continuous transmissions like mobile television services. An application layer FEC code may be used to increase the transmission reliability. * The Download Delivery Method is intended for ‚Äúdownload and play‚Äù services. A File Repair service may be offered to compensate for unreliable delivery. MBMS has been standardized in various groups of 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project), and the first phase standards are found in UMTS release 6. As Release 6 was functionally frozen by the 3rd quarter of 2004, practical network implementations may be expected by the end of 2007, and the first functional mobile terminals supporting MBMS are estimated to be available by also end of 2007. eMBMS has been standardized in various groups of 3GPP as part of LTE release 9. The LTE version of MBMS, referred to as Multicast-broadcast single-frequency network (MBSFN), supports broadcast only services and is based on a Single Frequency Network (SFN) based OFDM waveform and so is functional similar to other broadcast solutions such as DVB-H, -SH and -NGH. In Release 14, the 3GPP enhanced the specifications for eMBMS with a view to making the technology more attractive for deployment by operators and broadcasters. The 3GPP‚Äôs work on the next generation of technology in Release 16 includes a study on LTE-based broadcast on 5G networksTechnical explanation about LTE-based 5G Terrestrial Broadcast, MBMS APIs for mission-critical services and MBMS user services for IoT.GSA: LTE Broadcast (eMBMS) Market Update ‚Äì January 2019 (retrieved 7 January 2019)  3GPP technical specifications  MBMS Bearer Service (Distribution Layer): * 3GPP TS 22.146 Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Stage 1 * 3GPP TS 23.246 Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Architecture and functional description * 3GPP TS 25.346 Introduction of the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) in the Radio Access Network (RAN); Stage 2 * 3GPP TS 25.992 Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS); UTRAN/GERAN Requirements * 3GPP TS 36.300 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 (see chapter 15 for eMBMS) * 3GPP TS 36.440 General aspects and principles for interfaces supporting Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) within E-UTRAN * 3GPP TS 43.246 Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) in the GERAN; Stage 2 * 3GPP TR 25.803 S-CCPCH performance for Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) MBMS User Service (Service Layer): * 3GPP TS 22.246 Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) user services; Stage 1 * 3GPP TS 26.346 Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Protocols and codecs * 3GPP TR 26.946 Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) user service guidelines * 3GPP TS 33.246 3G Security; Security of Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) * 3GPP TS 32.273 Telecommunication management; Charging management; Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) charging  See also  * LTE * Mobile television * TDtv * Broadcast and Multicast Service (BCMCS), a point-to-multipoint service defined for 3GPP2 systems  References  Category:Broadcast engineering Category:LTE (telecommunication) Category:Mobile technology Category:Mobile telephone broadcasting ","title":"Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service"},{"id":"2995704","text":"Admiral Sir Israel Pellew, KCB, RN (25 August 1758 ‚Äì 19 July 1832), was an English naval officer who spent his career under the shadow of his more successful older brother Edward Pellew. Early naval service Pellew first went to sea aboard the sloop in 1771, serving in the West Indies. He went to the North American station on the frigate HMS Flora in 1776. Pellew was promoted to lieutenant1 April 1779 in the in April 1779 and then served on the frigates and Apollo. He was placed in command of the cutter in the North Sea in 1782. In 1783 he captured the Dutch privateer Flushinger in a single-ship action. Resolution transferred to the Irish station, with Pellew remaining in command until 1787. In March 1789 he joined , and was promoted to commander22 November 1790 in 1790, but was not employed again during the peace. On the outbreak of war in 1793 Pellew was temporarily without a ship, and served as a volunteer aboard his brother's command , being in charge of her aft guns when she captured the on 18 June, the first British naval victory of the French Revolutionary Wars. For this action, his brother was knighted and Israel Pellew was presented to King George III and made post captain25 June 1793 of . In April 1795 he was made captain of a larger frigate, , commanding her off Newfoundland and in the North Sea. In September 1796, sailing to join his brother's squadron in the Channel, Pellew took Amphion into Plymouth for repairs. On 22 September she suddenly exploded alongside the dock. About 300 of her crew and visitors were killed. Pellew survived, being blown through an open stern gallery window on to the deck of a sheer hulk. An inquiry blamed the explosion on the Amphion's gunner, who was suspected of stealing gunpowder which caught fire and blew up the fore magazine. However, Pellew had already complained that the magazine was poorly constructed and unsafe, and questioned the judgement on the deceased gunner. In February 1797 Pellew was appointed to but, having been put ashore when her crew mutinied at the Nore, and under pressure from his commander-in-chief, he resigned the command, being moved in July to . He commanded her first in the Channel, until November 1798, and then on the Halifax and Jamaica stations. In 1800, Pellew suffered a setback when a boat attack to seize some Spanish vessels from an anchorage off Cuba was driven off with significant casualties and only the capture of a small galley. Later Cleopatra ran aground off Abaco, one of the Bahamas. She was aground for three days and only floated off after her guns and some ballast had been thrown overboard. The Trafalgar Campaign Pellew next went to sea in April 1804 following the Peace of Amiens, commanding the ship of the line in the Channel before going to the Mediterranean in September and participating in the full chase across the Atlantic after the French fleet and the return leg to Cadiz. During this time, Pellew became good friends with his admiral and joined the famous Band of Brothers with which Nelson surrounded himself. The Conqueror fought well at the Battle of Trafalgar, being the fourth ship in the van or weather column under Nelson's command. The , Villeneuve's flagship, surrendered to Conqueror's captain of Marines, who had been sent aboard by Pellew to receive Villeneuve's sword. But as the Conqueror had sailed on to engage the and to attempt to block the escape of Dumanoir's squadron, the Marines could not return the sword to Pellew. During the course of these later actions, Pellew was wounded by a close miss from a cannonball, but refused to report it or have it treated until well after the battle. The French admiral's sword was eventually given to Admiral Collingwood after the battle and he retained it much to Pellew's disgust. Pellew was also greatly irked following the battle by the shadow of his brother, which appeared when the boarding party arrived on the deck of the Bucentaure. Marine captain James Atcherly boarded the ship and encountered Admiral Villeneuve, who asked for the identity of his captor. Atcherly replied that it was Captain Pellew, whereupon Villeneuve pronounced \\"It is a satisfaction to me that it is to so fortunate an officer as Sir Edward Pellew that I have surrendered\\". The greatly embarrassed Atcherly corrected his mistake, to which Villeneuve shouted \\"His brother? What are there two of them? Helas!\\". Although the Conqueror's sails and rigging suffered considerable damage, she suffered only three dead and nine wounded despite being in the thick of battle, and returned to Gibraltar largely unharmed by the large storm which followed the action, and was even able to help some more crippled ships back to port. After Trafalgar the Conqueror helped continue to blockade C√°diz and then, in 1807, was in the squadron sent to secure the Portuguese fleet and royal family. She remained off the Portuguese coast during much of 1808, eventually returning home after the surrender of Siniavin's Russian squadron in the Tagus. Pellew then left her and was appointed to superintend the payment of ships in the Medway. Admiral Pellew and retirement In 1810 Pellew was promoted to rear- admiralRear Admiral of the Blue 31 July 1810, of the White 12 August 1812, of the Red 4 June 1814 and in 1816 his brother, on receiving the command of the Mediterranean fleet, made him captain of the fleet, effectively his chief of staff. In 1815, Pellew was knighted. He retained the position of captain of the fleet until 1816, taking a prominent part in the negotiations with the Barbary powers that year and the ensuing bombardment of Algiers. This marked the end of his active service, but Pellew advanced automatically to the rank of vice-admiralVice Admiral of the Blue 12 August 1819, of the White 27 May 1825, of the Red 22 July 1825 in 1819. In the same year his only son, Edward, an officer in the Life Guards, was killed in a duel with a brother officer in Paris. Pellew was appointed a full admiral in 1830. He had moved to Plymouth in retirement and died there in 1832, after a long and painful illness. Pellew was buried near his home in Plymouth at Charles the Martyr Church, but on 21 March 1941 a massive German air raid in the Blitz demolished the church and its attendant graveyard. The ruins of the church remain standing as a memorial to that night, but there is no surviving indication of the whereabouts of Pellew's body or tomb, which is believed to have been lost.

Pope Clement VIII published on 14 July 1600 the first book to bear this name, a revision, in line with the renewal ordered by the Council of Trent, of the contents of books, called Ordines Romani, written from the end of the seventh century on to describe the ceremonies for the election and ordination of a Pope and to give indications for Mass and other celebrations by the Pope in the course of the year. The contents of these books were enriched over time. A work in two sections that became known as De C√¶remoniis Cardinalium et Episcoporum in eorum di≈ìcesibus (Ceremonies of Cardinals and Bishops in Their Own Dioceses) was added in the sixteenth century. Pope Clement VIII's C√¶remoniale Episcoporum was based on these texts and on others that have now been lost. The work of preparation, begun in December 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII took 17 years. A facsimile of the original 1600 edition in two books was published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 2000. Pope Innocent X issued a revised edition in 1650. In 1727 or 1729 the chapters, originally printed as single blocks, were divided into numbered paragraphs and summaries were added at the head of each chapter, in place of the previous titles. In 1752, Pope Benedict XIV revised slightly the two preexisting books and added a third on ceremonies to be observed by those holding civil office in the Papal States. In 1886, Pope Leo XIII made yet another revision, in which, though the Papal States had been incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy, he kept the third book. The Catholic Encyclopedia gives an account of the C√¶remoniale Episcoporum as it stood after this 1886 revision. In line with the renewal ordered by the Second Vatican Council, a fully revised edition in a single volume was issued by Pope John Paul II in 1984, replacing the earlier editions. The revision aimed at securing an episcopal liturgy that was \\"simple, and at the same time noble, fully effective pastorally, and capable of serving as an example for all other liturgical celebrations.\\" The book is in eight parts: # Episcopal liturgy in general # Mass # Liturgy of the Hours and Celebrations of the Word of God # Celebrations of the Mysteries of the Lord in the course of the year # Sacraments # Sacramentals # Noteworthy dates in the life of a bishop # Liturgical celebrations connected with solemn acts of episcopal governance There are also appendices on: # The vesture of prelates # A table of liturgical days arranged in order of precedence # A table on Ritual Masses, Masses for Various Needs, Votive Masses and Requiem Masses # Lists of abbreviations and sigla used in the book See also *Roman Ritual *Roman Pontifical *Liturgical Books of the Roman Rite References External links  Category:Catholic liturgy ","title":"Caeremoniale Episcoporum"},{"id":"2995746","text":"P√°l Tomori (c. 1475 ‚Äì 29 August 1526) was a Catholic monk and archbishop of Kalocsa, Hungary. He defeated an Ottoman army near Sremska Mitrovica () in 1523.P√°l Fodor and G√©za D√°vid: Ottomans, Hungarians, and Habsburgs in Central Europe: the military confines P√°l Tomori was elected commander-in-chief (jointly with Gy√∂rgy Szapolyai) of the Hungarian army in the battle of Moh√°cs in 1526. He died there while trying to stop fleeing soldiers. Paul Tomori Tomori's romantic statue in Kalocsa Life He was born into a common family in Aba√∫j County. He began his military career as the noble family of J√°nos Bornemisza. In Transylvania he was a Curian clerk, treasury official, isp√°n of the Salt Chamber, and from 1505 to 1514 he was a castle lord in Fogaras. In 1506 he contributed to the suppression of the Szekler uprising that broke out due to a tax called the ox roasting. In 1512 II. He was in the Turkish court as Ul√°szl√≥'s ambassador. At the end of July 1514, after Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa laid down his arms, J√°nos Szapolyai sent him against the peasant army besieging the city of Bihor. In the battle of Tomori, he defeated the insurgents and their leader, and also captured priest L≈ërinc. The Hungarian peasant war of 1514 ended with this battle. From 1514 to 1518 he was a castle captain in Fogaras and Munk√°cs, then in 1518 he was appointed captain of the castle in Buda. In May 1519, his action was due to the suppression of the commonplace rebellion in the palatine election parliament. In the middle of 1520, for unknown reasons - there is an assumption that due to the death of his bride [2] - he distributed his wealth among his relatives, entered the observant Franciscans and marched to the convent of Esztergom. Tomori was known as a good soldier, so in 1521, at the outbreak of the Turkish-Hungarian war, many saw in him a warlord who would be able to lead the Hungarian armies. According to a report from the Buda administration, the Hungarians did not have trained warlords, because the long peace(only some border military fought permanently, but most of the nobility lived far away from the Ottoman danger zone) ‚Äúeffeminated‚Äù them with reality, only P√°l Tomori was skilled in the craft of warfare. However, despite the encouragement, Tomori did not want to return to a secular career. Finally, at the request of Hungary, on February 4, 1523, VI. Pope Adorjan forced him to accept the archdiocese of Kalocsa, and then in April the Assembly of the Estates hastily entrusted him - according to contemporary reporting - with \\"the country's lieutenant and the captaincy of the entire Great Plain\\". Tomori complied with the instructions of the pope and the Assembly and thus became the organizer and military leader of the defense against the Turks. During its three years of operation in the South, it has earned serious merits in strengthening border protection. He arrived at his station in P√©terv√°rad in July 1523, and by August he had to fight the Bosnian pasha Ferh√°d, who, under the leadership of his army of about twelve thousand men, besieged the castle of Red in Szerem. On August 6 and 7, Hungarian troops won a decisive victory over Ferh√°d's army in three battles in the Nagyolaszi- Rednek-Sz√°vaszentdemeter triangle. This was the only significant Hungarian victory in the Hungarian-Turkish war of 1521‚Äì26. Over the next year and a half, Tomori sought to strengthen the southern border fortress system, especially the one in Szer√©ms. Relying on these castles, he repulsed the increasing frequency of Turkish invasions. By 1525, he had stabilized the situation so much that he was able to break into Turkish territory as well. He could not think of a larger campaign, because he received very little support from the Hungarian Treasury and the Hungarian lords. The diocese of Tomori spent all its income on defense and also received papal support, but this proved to be small in relation to the task. To make the court and the lords aware of the danger, he repeatedly threatened to resign, then on January 12, 1526, he actually submitted his resignation and began negotiations with the Turkish ambassador who detained in Buda. Later, Suleiman I had already decided to launch another campaign against Hungary, so Tomori withdrew his resignation and returned to his station again. His plan was to try to stop the Turkish army on the Drava line with an army of about six thousand. On August 24, he also defeated a Turkish prot√©g√©, but the military council ordered his army to join the Hungarian main army. Tomori opposed the decision, but carried out the order nonetheless. In the battle on August 29, he was the commander-in-chief of the Hungarian armies. In addition to many ecclesiastical and secular dignities, he also lost his life in the short battle.Csicsay Alajos: H√≠res √©s h√≠rhedt szem√©lyek a magyar t√∂rt√©nelemben. 2004 Dunaszerdahely. 126 p Legends Many legends and stories exist about him.

As the kernel of the medieval state of Vladimir-Suzdal, this area played a vital part in the development of Russian statehood. The site of an ancient Meryan sanctuary in Zalesye The name Zalesye alludes to the deep woods that used to separate the medieval Principality of Rostov from the Republic of Novgorod and from the Dnieper principalities. Slavic tribes already existed in today's European Russia in 1500 BC. Merians, Muroma, and other Volga Finnic tribes inhabited also the area. There was a strong interaction between the Slavs and Finnic peoples in these territories. The population of the area rapidly increased and by 1124 reached the point when Yuri Dolgoruki found it expedient to move his princely seat from Rostov in the Upper Volga Region to Suzdal in Zalesye. Lake Pleshcheyevo Suzdal was the oldest and most senior town of Opolye. Yuri established other important urban centres in Pereslavl-Zalessky (founded 1152), Yuriev-Polsky (1152), Dmitrov (1154), Starodub-on-the-Klyazma (1152), Vladimir-Zalessky (1108), Ksnyatin (1136), and Yaropolch-Zalessky (1136). The descriptors Zalessky (\\"beyond the woods\\") and Polsky (\\"in the fields\\") served to distinguish new cities from their eponymous towns in the south - now in modern-day Ukraine. Perpetually at odds with the powerful Suzdalian boyardom, Yuri even contemplated moving his capital from Suzdal to the new town of Pereslavl-Zalessky. His unexpected death (1157) forestalled this plan, but Yuri's son Andrew the Pious finally moved the princely seat to another young town, Vladimir, in 1157. The old nobility of Rostov and Suzdal, however, arranged Andrew's assassination (1174) and a brief civil war for supremacy in Zalesye followed. During the Mongol invasion of the Kieven Rus' (1223-1240), when the woods were gradually being cleared and new centres developed in Moscow, Tver, and elsewhere, the strategic importance of Zalesye declined. New urban centres developed around famous monasteries (e.g., Sergiev Posad, Kirzhach) or near royal residences (e.g., Alexandrov, Radonezh). Sometimes the term Zalesye can include the whole Upper Volga and Lower Klyazma region. In this sense, Zalesye equates to the territory included within the Golden Ring of Russia.

He hosted a radio show broadcast across the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Late in his life, he became additionally well known for a series of popular books about UFOs and other paranormal phenomena. Biography =Early life and career= Frank Edwards was born in Mattoon, Illinois, Edwards broadcast on pioneering radio station KDKA AM in the 1920s, making him one of the earliest professional radio broadcasters. During the 1930s, Edwards continued his career in radio, but also worked a variety of other jobs, including a stint as a professional golfer. He was hired by the US Treasury Department during World War II to promote war bond sales. =National radio, UFOs and controversy= After WWII, the Mutual Broadcasting System hired Edwards to host a nationwide news and opinion program sponsored by the American Federation of Labor. Edwards' program was a success, and became nationally popular. In 1948, Edwards received an advance copy of \\"Flying Saucers Are Real,\\" a magazine article written by retired U.S. Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe. Though already interested in the UFO reports that had earned widespread publicity since 1947, Edwards was captivated by Keyhoe's claims that the US military knew the saucers were actually extraterrestrial spaceships. Edwards began mentioning UFOs on his radio program, and wrote several books on the subject. He was dismissed from the radio program in 1954, for reasons that remain uncertain. His interest in UFOs was believed to be a factor, but Edwards's editor and friend Rory Stuartsee Stuart's preface to the anthology The Strange World of Frank Edwards (Lyle Stuart Inc, 1977) wrote, \\"[AFL President] George Meany insisted that Frank Edwards not mention any [competing labor union] CIO labor leaders on his program. He flatly refused and was fired.\\" In spite of thousands of letters in protest of his dismissal, Edwards was not reinstated. =Later career= After his dismissal from Mutual, Edwards continued working in radio, mostly at smaller local stations. He created and hosted a syndicated radio program, Stranger Than Science, which discussed UFOs and other Forteana. In 1959, he published a book with the same title, largely a collection of his radio broadcasts. From 1955 to 1959 and from 1961 to 1962, Edwards served as a commentator for WTTV television in Indianapolis. He was on radio station WXLW, also in Indianapolis, in 1964 and returned to television on WLWI in 1965.Frank Allyn Edwards on Answers.com His book \\"Strange People\\" recalls a television interview that was videotaped on October 3, 1961, with psychic Peter Hurkos.Strange People, Frank Edwards; 1961 p. 277. It is not known if any of these programs survive. During his time at WTTV, his program was the subject of experiments in subliminal advertising during 1958. The movie preceding his show contained the subliminal message \\"Watch Frank Edwards\\" inserted along with similar messages for bacon. Neither was a success in changing viewer habits. It is unknown if Edwards knew of the experiments.Quirkology: How We Discover the Big Truths in Small Things By Richard Wiseman 2008 p. 131 Edwards was a frequent contributor to Fate Magazine, and wrote the introduction to their compendium \\"Strange Fate\\". Edwards made an appearance on the Johnny Carson-era Tonight Show in October 1966. The episode was guest-hosted by singers Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. Although Carson saved videos of the show past 1969, this episode is presumed lost. On that telecast, Gorme made references to the fact that she enjoyed various science-fiction shows, like Star Trek and Time Tunnel, and Edwards made various references to experts' sightings of UFOs to promote his then-current book, \\"Flying Saucers‚ÄîSerious Business!\\" =His death= It is one of the myths of ufology that Edwards died on June 24, 1967, exactly 20 years after Kenneth Arnold's famous first \\"flying saucer\\" sighting. In fact, Edwards had died a few minutes before midnight on June 23, but his death was announced at the Congress of Scientific Ufologists in New York City on June 24, 1967.

Meteor scatter communication: A new understanding. In Meteor Burst Communications. Wiley, New York, 1993, 9‚Äì58. is a radio propagation mode that exploits the ionized trails of meteors during atmospheric entry to establish brief communications paths between radio stations up to apart. How it works As the earth moves along its orbital path, millions of particles known as meteors enter the earth's atmosphere every day, a small fraction of which have properties useful for point to point communication. When these meteors begin to burn up, they create a trail of ionized particles in the E layer of the atmosphere that can persist for up to several seconds. The ionization trails can be very dense and thus used to reflect radio waves. The frequencies that can be reflected by any particular ion trail are determined by the intensity of the ionization created by the meteor, often a function of the initial size of the particle, and are generally between 30 MHz and 50 MHz.\\"ITU - The Meteor Burst Communication Network System \\" The distance over which communications can be established is determined by the altitude at which the ionization is created, the location over the surface of the Earth where the meteor is falling, the angle of entry into the atmosphere, and the relative locations of the stations attempting to establish communications. Because these ionization trails only exist for fractions of a second to as long as a few seconds in duration, they create only brief windows of opportunity for communications. Development The earliest direct observation of interaction between meteors and radio propagation was reported in 1929 by Hantaro Nagaoka of Japan. In 1931, Greenleaf Pickard noticed that bursts of long distance propagation occurred at times of major meteor showers. At the same time, Bell Labs researcher A. M. Skellett was studying ways to improve night-time radio propagation, and suggested that the oddities many researchers were seeing were due to meteors. The next year Schafer and Goodall noted that the atmosphere was disturbed during that year's Leonid meteor shower, prompting Skellett to postulate that the mechanism was reflection or scattering from electrons in meteor trails. In 1944, while researching a radar system that was \\"pointed up\\" to detect the V-2 missiles falling on London, James Stanley Hey confirmed that the meteor trails were in fact reflecting radio signals. In 1946 the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) found a direct correlation between enhancements in VHF radio signals and individual meteors. Studies conducted in the early 1950s by the National Bureau of Standards and the Stanford Research Institute had limited success at actually using this as a medium. The first serious effort to utilize this technique was carried out by the Canadian Defence Research Board in the early 1950s. Their project, \\"JANET\\", sent bursts of data pre-recorded on magnetic tape from their radar research station in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan to Toronto, a distance exceeding 2,000 km. To burst the data, a 90 MHz \\"carrier\\" signal was monitored for sudden increases in signal strength, signalling a meteor, which triggered a burst of data. The system was used operationally starting in 1952, and provided useful communications until the radar project was shut down around 1960. Military use One of the first major deployments was \\"COMET\\" (COmmunication by MEteor Trails), used for long-range communications with NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe headquarters. COMET became operational in 1965, with stations located in the Netherlands, France, Italy, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway. COMET maintained an average throughput between 115 and 310 bits per second, depending on the time of year. Meteor burst communications faded from interest with the increasing use of satellite communications systems starting in the late 1960s. In the late 1970s it became clear that the satellites were not as universally useful as originally thought, notably at high latitudes or where signal security was an issue. For these reasons, the U.S. Air Force installed the Alaska Air Command MBC system in the 1970s, although it is not publicly known whether this system is still operational. A more recent study is the Advanced Meteor Burst Communications System (AMBCS), a testbed set up by SAIC under DARPA funding. Using phase- steerable antennas directed at the proper area of the sky for any given time of day, the direction where the Earth is moving \\"forward\\", AMBCS was able to greatly improve the data rates, averaging 4 kilobits per second (kbit/s). While satellites may have a nominal throughput about 14 times greater, they're vastly more expensive to operate. Additional gains in throughput are theoretically possible through the use of real-time steering. The basic concept is to use backscattered signals to pinpoint the exact location of the ion trail and direct the antenna to that spot, or in some cases, several trails simultaneously. This improves the gain, allowing much improved data rates. To date, this approach has not been tried experimentally, so far as is known. Scientific use The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) uses meteor scatter extensively in its SNOTEL system. Over 800 snow water content gauging stations in the Western United States are equipped with radio transmitters that rely upon meteor scatter communications to send measurements to a data center. The snow depth data collected by this system can be viewed on the Internet.SNOTEL Data Collection Network Fact Sheet In Alaska, a similar system is used in the Alaskan Meteor Burst Communications System (AMBCS), collecting data for the National Weather Service from automated weather stations, as well as occasional data from other US government agencies. Amateur radio use Most meteor scatter communications is conducted between radio stations that are engaged in a precise schedule of transmission and reception periods. Because the presence of a meteor trail at a suitable location between two stations cannot be predicted, stations attempting meteor scatter communications must transmit the same information repeatedly until an acknowledgement of reception from the other station is received. Established protocols are employed to regulate the progress of information flow between stations. While a single meteor may create an ion trail that supports several steps of the communications protocol, often a complete exchange of information requires several meteors and a long period of time to complete. Any form of communications mode can be used for meteor scatter communications. Single sideband audio transmission has been popular among amateur radio operators in North America attempting to establish contact with other stations during meteor showers without planning a schedule in advance with the other station. The use of Morse code has been more popular in Europe, where amateur radio operators used modified tape recorders, and later computer programs, to send messages at transmission speeds as high as 800 words per minute. Stations receiving these bursts of information record the signal and play it back at a slower speed to copy the content of the transmission. Since 2000, several digital modes implemented by computer programs have replaced voice and Morse code communications in popularity. The most popular mode for amateur radio operations is MSK144, which is implemented in the WSJT-X software.

The algorithm is similar to a set of wooden blocks of various shapes and colors sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. Only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved. Moreover, some kinds of blocks cannot have other blocks stacked on top of them. The simplicity of this toy world lends itself readily to classical symbolic artificial intelligence approaches, in which the world is modeled as a set of abstract symbols which may be reasoned about. Motivation Artificial Intelligence can be researched in theory and with practical applications. The problem with most practical application is, that the engineers don't know how to program an AI system. Instead of rejecting the challenge at all the idea is to invent an easy to solve domain which is called a toy problem. Toy problems were invented with the aim to program an AI which can solve it. The blocks world domain is an example for a toy problem. Its major advantage over more realistic AI applications is, that many algorithms and software programs are available which can handle the situation. This allows to compare different theories against each other. In its basic form, the blocks world problem consists of cubes in the same size which have all the color black. A mechanical robot arm has to pick and place the cubes. More complicated derivatives of the problem consist of cubes in different sizes, shapes and colors. From an algorithm perspective, blocks world is an np-hard search and planning problem. The task is to bring the system from an initial state into a goal state. Automated planning and scheduling problem are usually described in the PDDL notation which is an AI planning language for symbolic manipulation tasks. If something was formulated in the PDDL notation, it is called a domain. Therefore, the task of stapling blocks is a blocks world domain which stays in contrast to other planning problems like the dock worker robot domain and the monkey and banana problem.

It was declared a national park in 1981 and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986. It occupies 40 km2 (15 sq mi) and it extends into each of the six municipalities on the island. Nearly 450,000 tourists visit the park every year. There is accommodation for tourists just outside the park's boundary. The park is named after the rock formation of Garajonay, the highest point on the island at . It also includes a small plateau whose altitude is 790‚Äì1,400 m above sea level. Attractions The park provides the best example of Canarian laurisilva, a humid subtropical forest that in the Tertiary covered almost all of Southern Europe. It is also found on the Azores and the Madeira Islands. Laurus azorica, known as Azores laurel, or by the Portuguese names louro, loureiro, louro-da-terra, and louro- de-cheiro, can be found in the park, as well as Laurus novocanariensis, known as Canary laurel. Although named as a single type of forest, the national park englobes several varieties of forests. Most humid and protected valleys oriented to the North have the richest and most complex forests. It is known as valley laurisilva, a true subtropical rainforest where the largest laurel trees can be found. At higher altitudes, with less protection from wind and sun, the forest loses some of its more delicate species. Here it is called slope laurisilva (laurisilva de ladera). At the south the forest is mainly a mix of beech and heather, species adapted to the less humid atmosphere. Other attractions of the national park are the massive rocks that are found along the island. These are former volcanoes whose shapes have been carved by erosion. Some, like the \\"Fortaleza\\" (fortress in Spanish) were considered sacred by the native islanders, as well as ideal refuges when attacked. The park is crossed by a large network of 18 footpaths, trekking being one of the main tourist activities in the island. Many of the species of flora and fauna are endemic to the Macaronesian islands, the Canary Islands or La Gomera, and the Garajonay forest harbors a rich biota of understory plants, invertebrates, and birds and bats, including a large number of endemic species. Two species of reptile, Gallotia gomerana (Gomeran lizard) and Chalcides viridanus (Gomeran skink), can be found. Amphibians include the stripeless tree frog, Hyla meridionalis.

Their romance evokes those of Romeo and Juliet and Hero and Leander. Gara was a princess of Agulo on La Gomera. During the festival of Be√±esm√©n, it was customary for unmarried girls of Agulo to gaze at their reflections in the waters of Chorros del Epina. If the water was clear, they would find a husband; if it was cloudy, some misfortune would befall them. When Gara looked at the water, she saw her reflection clearly. However, she gazed too long and the sun's reflection blinded her temporarily. A wise man named Geri√°n told her that this meant that she needed to avoid all fire or else it would consume her. Jonay was the son of the Guanche mencey or king of Adeje on Tenerife, who arrived on the island to celebrate these ceremonies. Jonay's participation in the ensuing games attracted the attention of Gara, and the two fell in love. Unfortunately, when the engagement was announced, the volcano Teide, visible from La Gomera, began to erupt as if in disapproval. This was interpreted as a bad omen and the couple‚Äôs respective parents broke the engagement. Jonay was made to return to Tenerife, but one night, he swam across the channel that separated the two islands and rejoined his beloved. Their respective fathers ordered that the two be found. The lovers were soon trapped on a mountain, where they decided to take their own lives.

It is common in coal miners and others who work with coal. It is similar to both silicosis from inhaling silica dust and asbestos dust. Inhaled coal dust progressively builds up in the lungs and leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and in worse cases, necrosis. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, severe state, develops after the initial, milder form of the disease known as anthracosis (from the Greek Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÇ, or anthracas ‚Äî coal, carbon). This is often asymptomatic and is found to at least some extent in all urban dwellers due to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease, simple coal workers' pneumoconiosis and complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (or progressive massive fibrosis, or PMF). More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust develop industrial bronchitis, clinically defined as chronic bronchitis (i.e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. The incidence of industrial bronchitis varies with age, job, exposure, and smoking. In nonsmokers (who are less prone to develop bronchitis than smokers), studies of coal miners have shown a 16% to 17% incidence of industrial bronchitis. In 2013 CWP resulted in 25,000 deaths ‚Äî down from 29,000 deaths in 1990. However, a later 2018 study by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health shows a resurgence of the incurable respiratory illness, the highest rate recorded in roughly two decades.  Pathogenesis  Coal dust is not as fibrogenic as silica dust. Coal dust that enters the lungs can neither be destroyed nor removed by the body. The particles are engulfed by resident alveolar or interstitial macrophages and remain in the lungs, residing in the connective tissue or pulmonary lymph nodes. Coal dust provides a sufficient stimulus for the macrophage to release various products, including enzymes, cytokines, oxygen radicals, and fibroblast growth factors, which are important in the inflammation and fibrosis of CWP. Aggregations of carbon-laden macrophages can be visualized under a microscope as granular, black areas. In serious cases, the lung may grossly appear black. These aggregations can cause inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the formation of nodular lesions within the lungs. The centers of dense lesions may become necrotic due to ischemia, leading to large cavities within the lung. = Appearance = Simple CWP is marked by the presence of 1‚Äì2 mm nodular aggregations of anthracotic macrophages, supported by a fine collagen network, within the lungs. Those 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter are known as coal macules, with larger aggregations known as coal nodules. These structures occur most frequently around the initial site of coal dust accumulation ‚Äî the upper regions of the lungs around respiratory bronchioles. The coal macule is the basic pathological feature of CWP and has a surrounding area of enlargement of the airspace, known as focal emphysema. Continued exposure to coal dust following the development of simple CWP may progress to complicated CWP with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), wherein large masses of dense fibrosis develop, usually in the upper lung zones, measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter, with accompanying decreased lung function. These cases generally require a number of years to develop. Grossly, the lung itself appears blackened. Pathologically, these consist of fibrosis with haphazardly-arranged collagen and many pigment-laden macrophages and abundant free pigment. Radiographically, CWP can appear strikingly similar to silicosis. In simple CWP, small rounded nodules (see ILO Classification) predominate, tending to first appear in the upper lung zones. The nodules may coalesce and form large opacities (>1 cm), characterizing complicated CWP, or PMF. Diagnosis There are three basic criteria for the diagnosis of CWP: #Chest radiography consistent with CWP #An exposure history to coal dust (typically underground coal mining) of sufficient amount and latency #Exclusion of alternative diagnoses (mimics of CWP) Symptoms and pulmonary function testing relate to the degree of respiratory impairment but are not part of the diagnostic criteria. As noted above, the chest X-ray appearance for CWP can be virtually indistinguishable from silicosis. Chest CT, particularly high-resolution scanning (HRCT), are more sensitive than plain X-ray for detecting the small round opacities. = Treatment = There is no cure or discovered treatments for pneumoconiosis. Some patients are given oxygen to help with their breathing and are advised to stop smoking to prevent further decline in lung function. In the most extreme cases a lung transplant could be done to help prolong the patient's life expectancy. = Prevention of pneumoconiosis = The main way to avoid contracting coal worker's pneumoconiosis is to avoid the inhalation of coal dust. Some of the ways to prevent this disease include: not smoking, wearing ventilated masks when coming in contact with potentially dangerous airborne particles, regular pulmonary exams, and becoming educated about the risks of lung diseases in your work environment.  Epidemiology  A video on the history of black lung disease In 2013 CWP resulted in 25,000 deaths down from 29,000 deaths in 1990. Between 1970‚Äì1974, prevalence of CWP among US coal miners who had worked over 25 years was 32%; the same group saw a prevalence of 9% in 2005‚Äì2006. In Australia, CWP was considered to be eliminated in the 1970s due to strict hazard control measures. However, there has been a resurgence of CWP in Australia, with the first new cases being detected in May 2015.Sim, M., Glass, D., Hoy, R., Roberts, M., Thompson, B., Cohen, R., ... & Deponte, K. (2016). Review of Respiratory Component of the Coal Mine Workers Health Scheme for Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines. Final Report. Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, Monash University From 1999 to 2016, the average years of life lost due to CWP increased from 8.1 to 12.6 years, most likely due to the increased severity and progression of CWP. History A miner at the Black Lung Laboratory in the Appalachian Regional Hospital in Beckley, West Virginia. Black lung is actually a set of conditions and until the 1950s its dangers were not well understood. The prevailing view was that silicosis was very serious but it was solely caused by silica and not coal dust. The miners' union, the United Mine Workers of America, realized that rapid mechanization meant drills that produced much more dust, but under John L. Lewis they decided not to raise the black lung issue because it might impede the mechanization that was producing higher productivity and higher wages. Union priorities were to maintain the viability of the long-fought-for welfare and retirement fund, which would be sustained by higher outputs of coal. After the death of Lewis, the union dropped its opposition to calling black lung a disease and realized the financial advantages of a fund for its disabled members. In the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, the US Congress set up standards to reduce dust and created the Black Lung Disability Trust. The mining companies agreed to a clause, by which a ten-year history of mine work, coupled with X-ray or autopsy evidence of severe lung damage, guaranteed compensation. Equally important was a \\"rate retention\\" clause that allowed workers with progressive lung disease to transfer to jobs with lower exposure without loss of pay, seniority, or benefits. Financed by a federal tax on coal, the Trust by 2009 had distributed over $44 billion in benefits to miners disabled by the disease and their widows. A miner who has spent 25 years in underground coal mines has a 5‚Äì10% risk of contracting the disease. =21st century= After the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 became law in the United States, the percentage of American miners suffering from black lung disease decreased by about 90 percent. More recently, however, rates of the disease have been on the rise. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported that close to 9 percent of miners with 25 years or more experience tested positive for black lung in 2005‚Äì2006, compared with 4 percent in the late 1990s. New findings have shown that CWP can be a risk for surface coal miners, who are 48% of the workforce. Data from the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program of NIOSH, which examined chest X-rays from more than 2,000 miners in 16 US states from 2010‚Äì2011, showed that 2% of miners with greater than one year of surface mining experience developed CWP. 0.5% of these miners had PMF. Most of these workers had never worked in an underground mine prior to surface mining. A high proportion of the X-rays suggested that these miners had developed silicosis. NIOSH, with support from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), operates a Mobile Health Screening Program, which travels to mining regions around the United States. Miners who participate in the Program receive health evaluations once every five years, at no cost to themselves. Chest x-rays can detect the early signs of and changes in CWP, often before the miner is aware of any lung problems. A 2016-17 investigation by National Public Radio found that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health had under-reported cases of progressive massive fibrosis (a complication of black lung) by at least a factor of 20. NPR identified over 2,000 cases at certain clinics in Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, compared to 99 that NIOSH reported. NIOSH confirmed in 2018 the largest cluster of PMF ever scientifically documented, despite near- elimination of the disease in the 1990s. The causes of the spike are believed to include longer working shifts, mining of thinner coal seams (which causes mining machines to put more non-coal silica dust in the air), and retirements and layoffs that have prompted more former employees to visit health clinics. New U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration rules took effect in August, 2016, that lowered maximum allowed dust concentrations for surface and underground mines, and exposure by miners who have been found to be developing pneumoconiosis. Research Work to investigate the relationship between respirable dust exposure and coal worker's pneumoconiosis was carried out in Britain by the Institute of Occupational Medicine. This research was known as the Pneumoconiosis Field Research (PFR). The research underpinned the recommendations for more stringent airborne dust standards in British coalmines and the PFR was ultimately used as the basis for many national dust standards around the world.

Some of the franchise holders, most notably ITV plc and its predecessor companies Granada plc and Carlton Communications, launched other television channels, some with the ITV brand, some not.  Current channels  = ITV = thumb The ITV network was launched in 1955, a federal network of fifteen regional companies granted franchises either solely on a geographical basis or also on a weekday/weekend split basis. The franchises were reallocated several times and now, except for two in Scotland, all the franchises are owned by ITV plc, and are branded as ITV or UTV. The network contains a variety of programming, such as entertainment, dramas, documentaries, news, films and sport. A timeshift channel, ITV +1, is available on Freeview, Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media.  ITV HD  ITV HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel created by ITV. It was first trialled primarily to show the 2006 World Cup games to which ITV had the rights. It also showed looping previews, it began scheduled broadcasting on 9 June 2006 and ended on 30 November 2006. The full version was released as a simulcast on 17 July 2008 on all platforms. STV launched their HD service in June 2010. STV HD broadcasts in Central and Northern Scotland on Virgin Media and Freeview. The channel was made available on the Sky and Freesat EPGs in April 2014. UTV HD was launched in Northern Ireland in October 2010 exclusively to Virgin Media. It was later added to Freeview on 24 October 2012 after the completion of the digital switchover in the region. = ITV2 = After 1964, the fourth push-button channel selector on British televisions was traditionally labelled \\"ITV2\\", in the expectation that the second commercial channel would be awarded to ITV in the near future. In the event, Channel 4 claimed the button when it launched in 1982. It was not until 1998 that ITV launched its first new digital channel, known as ITV2. This combines more repeated and new entertainment and films as well as behind the scenes and imported programmes for the modern world. It is available on all digital services and broadcasts 24 hours a day. A timeshift channel, ITV2 +1, is available on Freeview, Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media. Before 2 August 2011, ITV2 +1 was only available on Freeview between 19:00 and 06:00, as it was forced to timeshare with CITV, and, in Scotland, TeleG (until it closed). ITV2 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV2. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel. = ITV3 = thumb ITV plc's third channel was launched on 1 November 2004 as ITV3. It was initially thought that ITV3 would continue alongside Plus, broadcasting only on Freeview and cable, but at a last minute deal made it available on Sky, replacing Plus on all platforms (except Freeview). It usually shows murder mysteries, classic dramas and movies. ITV3 is also available on all digital services and is available between 06:00 and 03:00, with teleshopping taking up the early hours of the day. A timeshift channel, ITV3 +1, is available on Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media. ITV3 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV3. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel. = ITV4 = thumb ITV4 is a digital channel based targeted at men. It began broadcasting on 1 November 2005. It broadcasts for the same amount of time as ITV3. It usually shows sport events, archival programming, and, similarly to ITV3, movies. A timeshift channel, ITV4 +1, is available on Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media. ITV4 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV4. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel. = ITVBe = thumb ITVBe is a lifestyle television channel from ITV plc, which launched on 8 October 2014. The channel broadcasts programmes previously broadcast on ITV2 such as The Real Housewives franchise and scripted reality show The Only Way Is Essex. The channel is available free-to-air on Freeview, Sky and Virgin Media. A high-definition simulcast and timeshift channel, ITVBe HD and ITVBe +1, are also available.  LittleBe  On 3 September 2018, ITVBe introduced a new children's strand titled, LittleBe, which is dedicated to British preschool programming. = CITV = The CITV channel is aimed at children under 12 years old, and broadcasts daily between 06:00 and 21:00. The channel launched on 11 March 2006 at 09:25 with Holly & Stephen's Saturday Showdown, on Freeview, Virgin Media and TalkTalk TV. It then launched on Sky on 8 May 2006 at 06:00, with other platforms to follow. The channel replaced the ITV News Channel on Freeview. In February 2008 it was moved to a space originally held by ABC1, allowing ITV4 to go 24/7 on Freeview; however, this means that it can no longer be received in Wales via Freeview because the channel would interfere with S4C if available in Wales. On 9 January 2012, a change in the FEC mode on the multiplex allowed CITV to broadcast in Wales on Freeview.  Defunct channels  The ITV network, as a whole has, owned other spin-off channels. Some were as joint ventures with other broadcasters; others were not. = With the ITV brand =  ITV Encore  thumb ITV Encore was a drama television channel from ITV plc launched on 9 June 2014. Unlike ITV's other channels it was available exclusively on Sky and Now TV, as part of their subscription packages. A high-definition simulcast and timeshift channel, ITV Encore HD and ITV Encore +1, was also available on Sky. Following an over-reliance on repeated content and less than stellar ratings, the channel closed on 1 May 2018 as part of ITV's plans to turn the channel into a box-set brand.  ITV Play  thumb ITV Play was a 24/7 participation television channel in the United Kingdom. It launched on 19 April 2006 on Freeview, and was also available on Sky Digital. It was embroiled in a scandal involving overpriced premium-rate phone lines, by which ITV plc pulled the channel off air until further notice. The channel's closure was announced on 13 March 2007, and it closed on 15 March 2007. The channel was replaced by ITV2 +1 on Freeview. The brand \\"ITV Play\\" continued during late night quiz show slots on the ITV Network until December 2007. While ITV plc had intended the make profits from the ITV Play brand, only the late night slots on ITV1 and ITV2 made money.  ITV News Channel  The ITV News Channel launched on 1 August 2000 under the name ITN News Channel. Carlton Television and Granada Television bought equal shares from ITN in the network and rebranded it ITV News Channel in September 2002. In April 2004 ITV bought NTL's 35 per cent share and took full control over the channel. The channel was closed on 23 December 2005 due to poor ratings and the launch of ITV4. It was replaced by ITV4 and CITV.  ITV Sport Channel  thumb The ITV Sport Channel, originally broadcasting UEFA Champions League football and ATP Masters Series tennis under the brand ONsport, was ITV's sports channel. It closed with (and indeed was responsible for) the collapse of ITV Digital. Lasting for just one football season; the ITV Sport Channel launched on Saturday 11 August 2001 with Man City v Watford in the First Division, and closed on Sunday 12 May 2002 with the Division 2 Play-off Final between Brentford and Stoke. There were two spinoff channels, ITV Sport Plus and ITV Sport Select, the latter used to show the on-demand Premier League football matches from Sky Sports. Whilst football was the mainstay of the channel, it showed the ATP Masters Series, British basketball and European Cup rugby union. Previously to the ITV Digital rebrand, the ITV Sport bouquet included ONsport 1 and ONsport 2, which were subject to rebrands themselves after ITV bought up the rights to the tennis Masters Series. Before then, the channel had been branded as Champions on 28, and Champions on 99.  ITV Select  This pay-per-view service on ITV Digital was formerly called ONrequest, which launched with ONdigital. It gave access to films, sport events and exclusive footage. It closed prior to the collapse of the platform due to ITV's financial difficulties and poor uptake.  ITV Box Office  thumb ITV Box Office was a pay-per-view sports channel. It launched on 4 February 2017. On 24 January 2020 ITV announced that it had closed the channel via this message posted on the ITV Box Office web page: 'The ITV Box Office service has ceased as of 24th January 2020. There are no further plans to show any future events on this channel.' = Without the ITV brand = Merit Merit launched in July 2020 exclusively on Freeview channel 34 that began broadcasting cooking and gardening programmes from 9pm to midnight.https://rxtvinfo.com/2020/merit- launching-on-freeview-channel-34https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/new-freeview- channel-merit/ The license for the channel was bought by Sky UK less than one month later, in August 2020. = With the UTV brand =  UTV2  Formerly TV You, owned by UTV plc, this was the Northern Irish equivalent to ITV2. It closed due to poor viewership, and the failure to attract any advertising during its existence.  UTV Ireland  UTV Ireland was a general entertainment channel available in Ireland. The channel was launched on 1 January 2015 and broadcast programmes from ITV Studios Global Entertainment such as Emmerdale and Coronation Street, often simulcast with the main ITV network. The channel was owned by ITV plc since February 2016, following the sale of UTV Media's television assets. In July 2016, ITV announced the sale of UTV Ireland to Virgin Media Ireland, owners of TV3. The channel was replaced by be3 on 9 January 2017. = Carlton Communications =  Carlton Cinema  This channel was owned by Carlton Communications showing classic cinema. It closed in 2003 due to poor viewing figures.  Taste CFN  Originally this was the Carlton Food Network, owned by Carlton Communications, showing cooking programmes. This was the first Carlton channel to be launched when it started on cable on 1 September 1996. The channel itself went bust in late 2001 due to financial difficulties. It was never replaced on the ITV Digital platform (but the closure stated that Carlton Cinema would replace this and fill in the gap)  Carlton Kids  This was owned by Carlton Communications showing children's television. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures. This channel, like Carlton World, was replaced by a timeshare of the now-defunct Discovery Kids and Discovery Wings on the ONdigital platform.  Carlton Select  This was a channel owned by Carlton Communications showing general entertainment programming. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures; however, it relaunched again in 2002 (for cable television only), suddenly it plunged into extreme risk as Carlton heard rumours about itself merging with Granada to form a single ITV (save for the Granada name). It struggled to keep going, but it failed and shattered, which meant it closed in 2003, due to the rumours of merging. Its slot was used to provide extra hours for Carlton Food Network. The channel had originally been broadcast as SelecTV since June 1995 as a cable exclusive but changed to Carlton Select in early 1997 and started on OnDigital when that platform went on air in late 1998.  Carlton World  This was a channel owned by Carlton Communications showing factual programming. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures. It was replaced by a timeshare of the now-defunct Discovery Kids and Discovery Wings on the ONdigital platform. = Granada plc =  Granada Breeze  thumb Originally Granada Good Life, Granada Breeze was another GSB owned venture. This was a lifestyle channel aimed at female viewers and showed programmes on lifestyle, cookery, health and US daytime television such as Judge Joe Brown. Cuts to the channel saw original programming drop in favour of US imports, which greatly impacted the channel‚Äôs ratings. It closed in January 2002 on Sky and ITV Digital due to poor viewing figures, but continued until April 2002 to honour contracts with NTL and Telewest.  Granada Plus  Owned by Granada Sky Broadcasting, a 50-50 joint venture between Granada plc and BSkyB, Granada Plus was a general entertainment channel aimed at older audiences and ran from archived material. The channel, initially launched as \\"Granada Plus\\", was later known as \\"G Plus\\" and finally simply \\"Plus\\". It continued to broadcast until 1 November 2004, when ITV sealed a deal to buy out Sky's stakes in GSB to close down the channel in order for ITV's new channel, ITV3, to take Plus' low EPG position on Sky Digital. The channel was replaced on digital satellite and cable platforms, but a closedown slide continued to be available as late as 2010 on analogue cable. The closedown slide has since become inaccessible to places where analogue cable is no longer supported, as the digital switchover occurred.  Granada Men & Motors  thumb Men & Motors was a men's lifestyle television channel in the UK. It was the last remaining station operated by Granada Sky Broadcasting after Plus became the third GSB channel to be closed down, being replaced by ITV3. A joint venture set up by Granada plc (now part of ITV plc) and BSkyB in 1996. Although ITV plc is now the sole owner of GSB, Sky will receive 49.5 per cent of any proceeds (net of liabilities) if Men & Motors is sold. The channel was previously available on Freeview but was removed to make way for ITV Play which was then removed to make way for ITV2 +1, but was still available on Sky Digital and Virgin Media. While it was still broadcasting, it was available from 11:00 to 04:00 every day with ITV Nightscreen taking up the hours of 04:00 to 06:00 and a mixture of teleshopping and animated captions between 06:00 and 11:00. Men & Motors was removed from Virgin Media on 25 March 2010, and closed on 1 April 2010 on Sky Digital and Freesat, making way for ITV HD.  Granada Talk TV  The last of the original GSB channels, Granada Talk TV focused primarily on chat shows. Due to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in the early hours of 31 August 1997, it ceased broadcasting on 31 August 1997. = Joint ventures with Granada Television=  Shop!  Shop! was a home shopping channel which was a joint venture between Granada and Littlewoods. It ran from 1999‚Äì2002 and was replaced on Freeview by QVC.  Wellbeing  Wellbeing was a health and beauty focused channel, a joint venture between Granada and Boots which lasted just nine months on air in 2001.  Super Channel  This was a pan-European cable and satellite channel launched in 1987 by all of the ITV companies except Thames Television (who was a shareholder in the SES Astra satellite operator instead), with the assistance of BBC Worldwide (then Enterprises) and of a few other third parties, such as the independent music television producer Music Box. This channel aimed to beam a selection of the best of British television from both past and present (from both the BBC and ITV) to those living in mainland Europe. It was aimed both at foreign viewers and British expatriates, along with the syndicated ITN World News and a few other programmes coming from other European countries (such as Holland). However, the channel ran into severe financial difficulties almost from the start, with rights problems involving Equity demanding full payment of royalties for its archive programming, and poor viewing figures, advertising revenue and profits. The channel eventually had to scrap much of its BBC and ITV output, and after failing to achieve its expectations in 1988 the channel's British shareholders sold the entirety of its shares to the Italian consortium Beta Television, who changed its programming output completely, although it continued carrying the ITN World News and being based in London. In 1993, it was bought by the American broadcaster NBC, relaunching it as NBC Super Channel, later renaming it NBC Europe. It finally closed in 1998. (The BBC launched its own satellite service immediately after the failure of Super Channel, BBC TV Europe (later BBC World Service Television and BBC World).) The Guardian newspaper speculated that the failure of Super Channel might have been a historical precedent to the bad luck that ITV has generally had with cable and satellite television. =Joint venture with JML= = The Store = JML Store is a UK television shopping channel, in partnership with JML Direct Limited, and programming block on ITV. Dubbed the \\"chatmercial\\", The Store combines the format of a chatshow with home TV shopping in front of a studio audience. The channel was first launched in November 2011 as \\"The Zone\\" exclusively on the Freeview platform, but was not available in Wales until 9 January 2012. On Tuesday 1 October, ITV rebranded the channel as \\"The Store\\", which also launched as a 24-hour channel on Freesat and Sky on the same day. The Freeview channel varies from the satellite feed, as it only broadcasts between 6 pm and 6 am, and airs the live casino programme Jackpot247 daily, between 10 pm and 3 am. On 1 August 2014, it was rebranded as \\"JML Store\\" on all platforms, except Freeview. =SMG plc/STV Group plc=  Sky Scottish  A joint venture between Scottish Television and BSkyB, this was a general entertainment channel for the Scottish market. It closed after 18 months on air due to poor viewing figures.  S2  Owned by SMG plc (now known as STV Group plc), this was the Scottish equivalent to ITV2. The channel simulcasted the vast majority of ITV2 programmes, albeit covering the ITV2 DOG with its own. It closed due to poor viewership. STV2 STV2 was a local television network in Scotland, operating five city-based TV licences serving Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Ayr. It was owned and operated by STV Group plc. Initially broadcast as two separate stations ‚Äì STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh ‚Äì the launch of three local licences in Aberdeen, Dundee and Ayr led to the launch of a single networked service on 24 April 2017. In May 2018, it was announced that STV2 would shut down at the end of June 2018 as part of a strategic review. It closed on 30 June 2018.

The fluid in this space is called interstitial fluid, comprises water and solutes, and drains into the lymph system. The interstitial compartment is composed of connective and supporting tissues within the body - called the extracellular matrix - that are situated outside the blood and lymphatic vessels and the parenchyma of organs. Structure The non-fluid parts of the interstitium are predominantly collagen types I, III, and V, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans, such as hyaluronate and proteoglycans that are cross- linked to form a honeycomb-like reticulum. Such structural components exist both for the general interstitium of the body, and within individual organs, such as the myocardial interstitium of the heart, and the renal interstitium of the kidney. The interstitium in the submucosae of visceral organs, the dermis, superficial fascia and perivascular adventitia are fluid filled spaces supported by a collagen bundle lattice. The fluid spaces communicate with draining lymph nodes though they do not have lining cells or structures of lymphatic channels. Functions The interstitial fluid is a reservoir and transportation system for nutrients and solutes distributing among organs, cells, and capillaries, for signaling molecules communicating between cells, and for antigens and cytokines participating in immune regulation. The composition and chemical properties of the interstitial fluid vary among organs and undergo changes in chemical composition during normal function, as well as during body growth, conditions of inflammation, and development of diseases, as in heart failure and chronic kidney disease. The total fluid volume of the interstitium during health is about 20% of body weight, but this space is dynamic and may change in volume and composition during immune responses and in conditions such as cancer, and specifically within the interstitium of tumors. The amount of interstitial fluid varies from about 50% of the tissue weight in skin to about 10% in skeletal muscle.

He graduated from University of Aberdeen with degrees in Master of Surgery, Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Law. His medical career spanned Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and London. He discovered that filariasis in humans is transmitted by mosquitoes. This is the foundation of modern tropical medicine, and he is recognized with an epithet \\"Father of Tropical Medicine\\". His discovery directly invoked the mosquito-malaria theory, which became the foundation in malariology. He eventually became the first President of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. He founded the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (subsequently absorbed into the University of Hong Kong) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Manson was inflicted with gout during his service in China. His recurring condition worsened with age. He died in 1922. Childhood and education Birthplace of Sir Patrick Manson Patrick Manson was a son of Alexander Manson and Elizabeth Livingstone Blaikie, born at Oldmeldrum, eighteen miles north of Aberdeen. His father was manager of the local branch of the British Linen Bank and Laird of Fingask. His mother was distant relative of the famed Christian missionary- explorer David Livingstone. He was the second son of a family of three boys and four girls. He developed a childhood passion in natural history, fishing, shooting, carpentry, mechanics and cricket. Among his Presbyterian-Christian family, he showed excellent memory for memorising church sermons at the age of 5 years. In 1857 his family moved to Aberdeen, where he entered Gymnasium School. He later continued at West End Academy. In 1859 he was apprenticed to Blaikie Brothers, ironmasters based in Aberdeen. However he was struck by a type of tuberculosis called Pott's disease of the spine which forced him to take rest. In 1860 he entered the University of Aberdeen from where he completed medicine course in 1865. He was only nineteen and was underage for graduation, so he visited hospitals, museums and medical schools in London. Finally of age he formally graduated in October 1865, and was appointed Medical Officer at Durham Lunatic Asylum, where he worked for seven months. He performed 17 postmortem dissections on patients with psychiatric illnesses for his thesis. In 1866 he received the degrees of Master of Surgery, Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Law. In China Patrick Manson Patrick Manson was inspired by his elder brother, David Manson, who worked in Shanghai in medical service, to join medical officer post in the Customs Service of Formosa (now Taiwan). Manson traveled to Formosa in 1866 as a medical officer to the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs, where he started a long career in the research of tropical medicine. His official daily duty involved inspecting ships docked at the port, check their crews and keep the meteorological record. He also attended to Chinese patients in a local missionary hospital where he was exposed to a wide variety of tropical diseases for his postgraduate training without any supervision. His only research tool was a combination of clinical skill, hand lens and good record keeping. He was in good terms with the native Chinese, learning Mandarin and befriending them. However, due to political conflict between China and Japan over the occupation of the island, he was advised by the British Consul to leave. After 5 years in Formosa, he was transferred to Amoy, on the Chinese coast where he worked for another 13 years. Once again he again served the local Chinese patients at the Baptist Missionary Society's Hospital and Dispensary for the Chinese. His brother David joined him for 2 years. =Discovery= He spent his early years researching filaria (a small worm that causes elephantiasis). Manson focused his time on searching for filaria in blood taken from his patients. From this he began to work out the life cycle of filaria and through painstaking observation discovered that the worms were only present in the blood during the night and were absent during the day. He conducted experiments on his gardener, Hin Lo, who was infected with filaria. He would get mosquitoes to feed on his blood while he slept and then dissect the mosquitoes filled with Hin Lo's blood. \\"I shall not easily forget the first mosquito I dissected. I tore off its abdomen and succeeded in expressing the blood the stomach contained. Placing this under the microscope, I was gratified to find that, so far from killing the Filaria, the digestive juices of the mosquito seemed to have stimulated it to fresh activity.\\" Manson observed that filaria only developed as far as an embryo within the human blood and that the mosquito must have a role in the life cycle. Through these early experiments he started to hypothesise about the role of mosquitoes and the spread of disease. That the mosquito (Culex fatigans, now Culex quinquefasciatus) was the intermediate host of the filarial parasite (Wuchereria bancrofti) was a medical breakthrough in 1877. His experimental results were published in the China Customs Medical Report in 1878, and relayed by Spencer Cobbold to the Linnean Society in London. Out of this arose the mosquito-malaria theory, which suggested that the agent that causes malaria was also spread by a mosquito. In the British Medical Journal in 1894 he published 'On the Nature and Significance of Cresenteric and Flagellated bodies in Malarial Blood'. In this article he states, \\"the mosquito, having been shown to be the agent by which the filaria is removed from the human blood vessels, this or similar suctorial agent must be the agent which removes from the human blood vessels those forms of the malaria organism which are destined to continue the existence of this organism outside the body.\\" He then proposes, \\"the hypothesis I have ventured to formulate seems so well grounded that I for one, did circumstances permit, would approach its experimental demonstration with confidence. The necessary experiments cannot for obvious reasons be carried out in England, but I would commend my hypothesis to the attention of medical men in India and elsewhere, where malarial patients and suctorial insects abound.\\" Sir Ronald Ross approached Manson in London and went on to prove this theory. The subsequent correspondence between Ross and Manson is documented as one of the most legendary collaborations in the history of medicine. Manson's theory was finally proved by Ross in 1898 who described the full life cycle of the malarial parasite (of birds) inside the female mosquito. Ross won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for this discovery. Both Manson and Laveran were also nominated for the Nobel prize. During his acceptance speech, Ross controversially did not acknowledge Manson as his primary mentor. The subsequent fall out between these two great men is well documented in the book The Beast in the Mosquito: The Correspondence of Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson.The Beast in the Mosquito: The Correspondence of Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson. Edited by William F. Bynum, Caroline Overy (Cilo Media 51, 1998 ) Manson also demonstrated a new species of Schistosoma (Bilharzia) known as Schistosoma mansoni. In 1882, he discovered sparganosis, a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm Spirometra. In Hong Kong From 1883 to 1889, Manson worked in Hong Kong. He was the first to import cows from his native Scotland to Hong Kong and thus establish a dairy farm in Pok Fu Lam in 1885 and the company Dairy Farm in Hong Kong. However his most significant works are in medical education. He was the founder of the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, where Sun Yat-sen was one of his first pupils. In 1896, through his contacts at the Foreign Office, Manson managed to secure the release of Sun after he had been kidnapped in London by Chinese officials. Sun went on to become the first President of the Republic of China. In 1911 Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese became the University of Hong Kong. In London After 23 years in Southeast Asia, Manson had amassed considerable wealth from his medical practices. He returned to London in 1889, and settled at 21 Queen Anne Street, W1. In 1890 he qualified the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians. He became Physician at the Seamen's Hospital Society in 1892 and also Lecturer on Tropical Diseases in St George's Hospital. In July 1897 was appointed Chief Medical Officer to the Colonial Office. It was here that he used his influence to push for the foundation of a School of Tropical Medicine at the Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital. In a speech in 1897, he endorsed a call by fellow Scottish physician Andrew Davidson for courses in tropical medicine at every British medical school.Manson, P. (1897).

The screenplay was written by Richard Outten. It is the sequel to the film Pet Sematary which was based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. The film stars Edward Furlong, Anthony Edwards, and Clancy Brown. Pet Sematary Two was theatrically released in the United States on August 28, 1992, by Paramount Pictures and grossed $17.1 million worldwide. It received negative reviews from critics, but Clancy Brown's performance received critical acclaim. Plot Following the accidental death of his mother Renee, 13-year-old Jeff Matthews and his veterinarian father, Chase, move to Ludlow, Maine, his mother's hometown. He's introduced to the belligerent town sheriff, Gus Gilbert, and his stepson, Drew, whom Gus abuses relentlessly. Jeff also draws the ire of local bully Clyde Parker, who tells him about the story of the Creed family and the legend of the MiÍûåkmaq burial ground. One night, Gus shoots and kills Drew's beloved dog Zowie after the dog disturbs him during sex. Drew asks Jeff to help him bury the dog in the MiÍûåkmaq burial ground to see if the rumors are true that it can resurrect the dead. Zowie does indeed return from the dead but is uncharacteristically fierce. Chase treats Zowie for his gunshot wound, which refuses to heal; even more bizarre is the fact that Zowie has no heartbeat. Chase sends a sample of Zowie's blood to a lab. It turns out that Zowie's cells have completely deteriorated and are no different from those of a dead canine. Jeff and Drew go to the pet cemetery on Halloween for a night of horror stories with local boys. When Gus finds out that Drew's mother allowed him to go despite being grounded, he rushes to the cemetery and breaks up the party. He attacks his stepson, but just as he is about to hit him with a grave marker, Zowie appears. The dog fatally mauls Gus, whom the boys subsequently bury at the Indian cemetery. Gus returns to life; he now moves stiffly and rarely speaks, but treats Drew better. Over time, Gus becomes increasingly crude and sadistic, sexually assaulting Drew's mother and brutally skinning the pet rabbits for supper. Zowie breaks out of the veterinary clinic and kills three cats before entering Chase's home and attacking him. A day later, Jeff encounters Clyde, who is about to sever Jeff's nose using the wheel spokes of his own bicycle when Gus shows up. He sends Jeff home, then murders Clyde as Drew looks on. Gus then pursues Drew to their house, where the boy is trapped with the savage Zowie. He escapes through a window just as his mother arrives home in her car, and the two take off. Gus pursues them at high speed in his police car, eventually killing them both by ramming their car into an oncoming potato truck. Gus then returns to Clyde's body and puts it in a body bag, intending to take it to the burial ground as well. After Drew's funeral, Jeff decides to reanimate his mother by using the Indian burial ground's power. Gus exhumes her corpse and brings it to Jeff at the burial ground. When Chase hears that his wife's grave has been robbed, he rushes to the Gilbert house. There, he is attacked by Zowie and Gus, and he shoots and kills them both. Upon coming back to life, Renee stabs and kills Marjorie Hargrove, the Matthews' housekeeper. Jeff confronts his undead mother in the attic, and they embrace. Chase arrives home and urges Jeff to get away from Renee, who says she wants to spend quality time with her husband. An undead Clyde arrives and, after knocking Chase out, tries to kill Jeff ‚Äî first with an axe and then with an ice skate. Renee locks Chase and both boys in the attic, which she then sets on fire. Jeff kills Clyde with a severed livewire and then breaks down the attic door to escape. Not letting both Jeff and Chase leave, Renee says that she and the three want to work things out. Renee wants Jeff to stay and join her in death, saying she loves him. But Jeff drags his father out of the house as Renee is destroyed by the flames while shrieking \\"Dead is better!\\" In the final scene, a recovering Chase locks up his veterinary clinic before he and his son leave Ludlow behind.

She has stated that her original concept for the film would have involved Ellie Creed as the central character, the only survivor from the first film. However, Paramount was not confident in making the film's lead a teenage girl, so the story was written with completely new characters and a male protagonist. Thirteen-year-old Furlong was cast in the lead role, capitalizing on his rise to fame in the previous year's blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Shooting took place in Coweta County, Georgia. Release Stephen King, who wrote the novel upon which the first film was based, had his name removed from the film prior to its release. The film debuted at #3. Home media Paramount Home Video released Pet Sematary Two on VHS in April 1993, and on DVD in September 2001. Shout Factory released it on Blu-ray on February 25, 2020. The original score / soundtrack album was released on CD as a limited edition from La-La Land Records on August 29, 2019, and on limited-edition vinyl (October 11, 2019) and audio cassette (September 3, 2019) from Terror Vision Records. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 22% of 23 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating was 3.7/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"is much better at special effects than at creating characters or telling a coherent story\\". Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Not nearly as scary as the 1989 original, it nonetheless expresses and attempts to resolve in bold mythological terms the anxieties of being 13.\\" Variety wrote, \\"Pet Sematary Two is about 50% better than its predecessor, which is to say it's not very good at all.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post likened it to \\"an elongated Tales from the Crypt\\" episode and criticized the script as a rehash of the original.

A on display at the Deutsches Panzermuseum Munster, Germany. This article discusses tanks of the interwar period. World War I established the validity of the tank concept and between the two world wars, many nations needed to have tanks, but only a few had the industrial resources to design and build them. During and after World War I, Britain and France were the intellectual leaders in tank design, with other countries generally following and adopting their designs. This early lead would be gradually lost during the course of the 1930s to the Soviet Union and, to a lesser extent, Nazi Germany.  General developments  Mark VIII (Liberty) Tank The final tank designs of 1918 showed a number of trends. The joint US and British Mark VIII tank was supposed to be a common heavy tank design for them and the French. The design should have overcome the limitations of the earlier British heavy tanks. The , 37-ton armored vehicle was powered by a 300-hp (224 kW) V-12 engine and capable of 7 mph (11 km/h) cross-country. Although 100 were built, it was the much smaller Renault FT that set the pattern for almost all tanks that followed it; these tanks generally had lower track profiles and more compact hulls, and mounted their weapons in turrets. Worldwide, many sizes of tank were considered, and much of the development effort went into light tanks that were useful primarily against infantry or for colonial police-type work. The worldwide economic difficulties of the 1920s and 1930s led to an increased emphasis on light tanks as they were much cheaper to produce than medium or heavy tanks. However, the Spanish Civil War showed that tank-versus-tank engagements and tank-versus-towed antitank gun engagements would now be a major consideration for the future of tank warfare. It became clear that tanks would need to be heavily armoured and carry larger guns. Tank shape, previously guided purely by considerations of obstacle clearance, now became a trade-off between a low profile, desirable for stealth, and weight savings. The BT-2 tank of 1932 was the first modification of Walter Christie's design. A13 Cruiser Mk IV tank. In Britain, a great deal of study on the future of tank warfare was carried out, and there were some differences. Whilst both J.F.C. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart foresaw a war where all arms, infantry, tanks and artillery, would be mechanised, Fuller's theories looked at all-arms formations with artillery, infantry and military engineers mounted on similar vehicles to keep pace with the tanks. He foresaw armies using heavy all-arms formations to break through opponents defences, allowing lighter, faster units to make rapid advances, thereby not allowing the enemy to re- establish any defences. Liddell Hart considered that armoured vehicles would carry their own supporting infantry, in much the same way as modern warships carry their own marine detachments; he also proposed using indirect attack, effectively going around any defences. During the late 1920s the British Army established the Experimental Mechanized Force, to test these theories and look at the basic problems of managing, controlling and commanding all arms formations, including the use of aircraft. Many of the units involved in this force were posted to North Africa, where their experience played a major part in the British success in the East African Campaign and General Wavell's initial successes in the Western Desert campaign. The British used three classes of tank: the 'Infantry', for supporting the infantry; the 'Cruiser', for fast moving encounter battles and reconnaissance; and the light tank, for reconnaissance, escort and internal security. In the U.S., J. Walter Christie developed a series of fast tanks, based on his revolutionary Christie suspension system. This was combined with very high power-to-weight ratios achieved by fitting large aircraft engines in his tanks. Although his prototypes were capable of very high speeds, and in some cases designed to be air transportable, disputes with the United States Army Ordnance Corps and a high price (compared with what the US military was willing to pay) meant they were never produced in the USA. Christie's prototypes were however purchased by the Soviet Union, and were to be developed into the BT tanks and eventually, on the eve of World War II, the famous T-34. The success of the BT series, when observed by Fuller, at Russian Army manoeuvres, influenced the British to buy a Christie Tank, imported as a \\"Tractor\\", which led to Christie's suspension incorporated into British cruiser tank designs such as the A13 Cruiser Mk IV, Crusader, and others. BT-7A artillery support tank was a self-propelled gun variant of the Soviet BT tank, armed with a 76.2 mm howitzer. Soviet BT-7 tanks on parade. Today it may be difficult to understand why the tank idea found such resistance from the leadership of several armies. Part of the explanation is that the entire automotive industry was in its infancy. Tanks were rightly considered unreliable, troublesome equipment as late as the early 1930s. Weak engines, poor transmissions, and fragile, short-life tracks contributed to this reputation. The otherwise- incomprehensible resistance to tanks from 'traditional' military leadership can be partly understood in this light; a tank battalion that loses most of its vehicles due to mechanical failure on a 50-mile movement is not a reliable asset in combat. The international success of the Vickers six-ton tank is due more to its high reliability than any brilliance in the design. However, as the decade passed, engines, transmissions and tracks all improved. By the beginning of World War II, reliable engines and transmissions, as well as high-speed suspension designs were all available. A final trend in the between-the-wars period was changes in manufacturing methods. France pioneered the use of very large castings to form gun mantlets, turrets and eventually, with the S-35, entire tank hulls. The widespread use of casting was copied by the US and USSR, and to a lesser extent in the UK. Casting enables the fast manufacture of ballistically well-shaped components. Germany never made much use of large cast components, limiting casting to smaller items such as mantlets. Welding gradually replaced riveting and bolting as a means of fastening rolled armor plate together. Rivets can shear off when struck by enemy fire, resulting in additional crew casualties. Germany and the USSR led the way with welding, although the US followed closely. Riveting and bolting remained in use in some countries such as Hungary, Japan, and Italy, and to a lesser extent in the United Kingdom right to the end of World War II. Finally, the US and USSR led the way in rationalizing designs for fast production, eliminating unnecessary components or manufacturing steps that added little value. In contrast, French and German pre-war (and even wartime) tanks often incorporated features that added cost or manufacturing complexity out of proportion to their combat value.  United Kingdom  Vickers Medium Mark Is on a manoeuvre somewhere in England, 1930 Following World War I, many experiments involving armoured vehicles were conducted in Britain. The most significant advances were made in the areas of suspensions, tracks, communications, and the organization of these vehicles on the battlefield. British designs, particularly those from Vickers-Armstrong, formed the basis for many of the most common tanks of the 1930s and early World War II. For example, the Vickers Six Ton Tank was the basis for the Polish 7TP, the Soviet T-26, and was a major influence on the Italian M-11 and M-13 series and the Czech LT-35. The six-ton Vickers tank was not adopted by the British Army. Vickers Medium Mark II Tank. Another notable design was the Vickers Medium Mk II, a pivotal design which combined some of the best traits of World War I tanks into a much faster tank. It had a fully rotating turret on top like the FT, but mounted a dual-use 3-pounder gun (that could fire both high-explosive and anti-tank shells) with a coaxial machine gun. It also had a radio, a machine-gunner position in the front of the hull, and some limited use of sloped armour. Some of these tanks would go on to serve in World War II, though most of the significance of the design lies in the number of features that were utilized in later tank designs. The Vickers Carden-Lloyd machine gun carriers influenced the tankette concept through export and similar designs such as the Soviet T-27, Italian CV-33, German Panzer I and other copies. A perhaps less significant but also notable design was the Vickers A1E1 Independent, which was a large heavy tank that was built in 1925. It had a large main turret and four smaller turrets. This design concept was later used by the Soviet T-28 and T-35 tanks as well as the German Neubaufahrzeug. Carden-Loyd tankette towing a howitzer. Exponents of the replacement of the cavalry function by armoured vehicles were Liddell Hart and Fuller. Their opponents misinterpreted (either mistakenly or deliberately) them as proponents of an all-tank fighting force, though their views did specify that artillery and infantry should be mechanised to make them as fast and manoeuvrable as the tanks they advocated, and experiments were curtailed. An outstanding achievement of the British Army was the creation of the Experimental Mechanised Force in the late 1920s. This was a small Brigade- sized unit developed to field-test the use of tanks and other vehicles. The unit pioneered the extensive use of radio to control widely separated small units. The unit was short-lived, however. Vickers A1E1 \\"Independent\\" Eventually, by the 1930s, British experiments and their strategic situation led to a tank development programme with three main types of tank: light, cruiser, and infantry. The Infantry tanks were tasked with the support of dismounted infantry. The maximum speed requirement matched the walking pace of a rifleman, and the armour on these tanks was expected to be heavy enough to provide immunity to towed anti-tank guns. Armament had to be sufficient to suppress or destroy enemy machine gun positions and bunkers. Cruiser tanks were tasked with the traditional cavalry roles of pursuit and exploitation, working relatively independently of the infantry. This led to cruiser tank designs having great speed. To achieve this they were lightly armoured, and tended to carry anti-tank armament. The light tanks were tasked with reconnaissance and constabulary-type colonial roles, with cheapness the major design factor. Vickers-Armstrong built a series of light tanks, to be sold either to the British Army who wanted to keep costs down or to foreign militaries.  France  The French used a very wide range of tanks, including many unique types. France was the second largest tank producer in the world, behind the Soviet Union (see French armoured fighting vehicle production during World War II). Their cavalry tank class filled the role of what are now called MBTs. They also fielded a heavy tank design, and several lighter types for scouting and infantry support. In addition to these types, they were also working on super-heavy breakthrough tanks (FCM F1). The French didn't have an independent Tank Corps. All tanks belonged to either the Infantry or the Cavalry. The French Renault R35 tank * Infantry Tanks (Chars) ** Light Tanks (Chars L√©gers), generally similar to other nations' light tanks, though they were intended to be used more for infantry support rather than scouting, and as such were better armoured but slower than many other light tanks. The Renault R35 was the most common type; small numbers of the futuristic FCM 36 were built. The R35 was also exported to several eastern European countries, including Romania and Poland. ** Medium Tanks (Chars de Bataille), these were in fact meant to be specialised breakthrough tanks (Char D1, Char D2, Char B1). ** Heavy Tanks (Chars Lourds); only the World War I-vintage Char 2C was ever operational in this class, being the reason why the breakthrough role was delegated to the Chars de Bataille. * Cavalry Tanks (Automitrailleuses). These classes focused on speed in addition to the power and protection of other tank designs, and were intended for both anti-tank and anti-personnel work. As by law all tanks (Chars) had to be part of the Infantry, the Cavalry called its tanks Automitrailleuses. These included the Hotchkiss H35. ** Armoured Combat Tanks (AMCs or Automitrailleuses de Combat), a medium tank that sacrificed some armour for speed, and had similar armament to the infantry tanks (AMC 34, AMC 35, SOMUA S35). ** Armoured Reconnaissance (AMRs or Automitrailleuses de Reconnaissance), essentially light tanks (AMR 33;AMR 35), but specifically intended for general reconnaissance and maintaining a security screen. Specialised reconnaissance however would be carried out by AMD's or Automitrailleuses de D√©couverte, typically armoured cars or half-tracks. French 13.2 mm-armed AMR 35s, belonging to 4e RDP, 1re DLM. The Renault FT-17 had a long life and saw use in World War II and even later in Indochina. It was utilised as far away as in China, during the Chinese Civil wars, and versions of the tank were used both against and by the Japanese during the invasion of China. A large number found their way into both Republican and Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War. They were used in the Russian Revolution by both the Bolsheviks and the White Russians, and later by the Finns against the Soviets. France exported the FT-17 right up to World War II. The design was also developed by the Italians as the Fiat 3000 and the USSR as the T-18. By the mid-1930s the French Army was replacing the aging FT-17 fleet with a mixed force of light tanks both in the Infantry and Cavalry branches, as well as medium and heavy tanks. The Infantry light tanks included the Renault R 35, which followed the FT-17 concept quite closely with its very small size, two-man crew, and short 37 mm gun armament. It was, however, heavily armored. The R 35 was mostly used to equip the independent tank battalions, an armoured reserve allocated at army level and intended to reinforce infantry divisions in breakthrough operations. French infantry divisions normally had no organic tank component. The R 35 was exported to Poland and Romania. The cavalry had the similar Hotchkiss H 35, armed with the same 37 mm, as well as light recon tanks such as the AMR 35. France also produced what may have been the best tank of the 1930s, the SOMUA S35. This tank equipped the armoured divisions of the Cavalry which had to execute the exploitation phase of a battle and was probably the best combination of armour, firepower and mobility prior to the appearance of the German PzKpfw IV Ausf. F2 and Soviet T-34. The S 35 had a long 47 mm gun that could kill any tank then in service, as well as heavy cast armour and good speed. Char B1 bis at the Mus√©e des Blind√©s at Saumur The French char de bataille Char B1 tank was a very formidable tank, with heavy cast and riveted armour, the same long 47 mm gun as in the S 35, and a hull-mounted 75 mm howitzer. All Char B1s were equipped with radio and the tank was nearly invulnerable to most tanks and towed antitank guns. They equipped the armoured divisions of the Infantry, which were specialised breakthrough units. In general, French tanks of the 1930s were well-armoured, innovative vehicles that owed little to foreign designs. However, the light tanks lacked firepower and almost all French tanks were crippled by their one-man turrets. Even the vaunted Char B1 had a commander who was tasked with commanding the vehicle, aiming the main gun, and loading the main gun. If he were a platoon leader or company commander, he had the additional tasks of controlling his other units. Such a heavy set of tasks was overwhelming, and greatly reduced the effectiveness of the tanks. The lack of radios with the light tanks was not seen as a major drawback, since French doctrine called for slow-paced, deliberate manoeuvers in close conformance to plans: the \\"Methodical Battle\\" concept, adopted because wargaming showed it to be superior. The role of small unit leaders was to execute plans, not to take the initiative in combat. This was nearly the opposite of German doctrine, which stressed initiative and decision-making at low command levels (Auftragstaktik). In 1939 a belated effort was made to improve flexibility and increase the number of radios. Despite the views of Estienne and later Charles de Gaulle, the French general staff failed in defining an effective military doctrine regarding their use, due to the division of labour between infantry and cavalry tanks. In the Battle of France, despite an advantage in number and armour against the Germans, the French tanks were not used to good enough effect. The infantry tanks were only effective in executing the breakthrough phase of a battle; and thus useless as a mobile reserve. Ironically, cooperation with the infantry was poor. The Cavalry units alone were too few in number. After the Fall of France, work on new designs, such as the Char G1, officially halted, although there was some clandestine designing done. After the liberation of France, the next tank to be introduced would be the ARL 44 heavy tank, which came too late to participate in World War II, but was used post-war for a time.  Soviet Union  T-18 light tank The Soviet Union's efforts in tank design and production must be understood in the context of the experience of the Russian Civil War and the growth of Soviet industry. During the civil war, the use of armored trains and artillery trains was common. This tended to lead to a greater interest in tanks and armored cars compared to some western nations. The rapid growth of heavy industry in the USSR under the Five-Year plans made a large tank fleet possible. Initially, the tanks and armored cars in Soviet hands were a mix of FT-17 imports and a few British tanks left behind in the civil war. The first Soviet tank, the T-18 (sometimes called MS-1) was a fairly close copy of the FT-17, but with improved suspension and a larger turret. Stalin's enthusiasm for industrialisation and mechanisation drove an aggressive military development program, resulting in by far the largest and broadest tank inventory of all nations by the late 1930s. In 1926, under a secret annex to the Treaty of Rapallo, the Soviet Union and Germany set up a joint tank school at Kazan, which was illegal under the Treaty of Versailles. Both countries learned much about tank design and tactics in this co-operative venture. The Germans provided advice on mechanisation of Soviet heavy industry, and helped develop a sense of professionalism in the Red Army. From 1929, an experimental Mechanised Brigade was formed, training and developing combined-arms tactics with foreign tanks, armoured cars, tractors, and lorries. The Soviets also spent tens of millions of dollars on U.S. equipment and technology to modernise dozens of automotive and tractor factories, which would later produce tanks and armoured vehicles. The multi-turreted T-28 medium tank. The T-28 was the first series-produced modern medium tank. Based on a mixed force of foreign tanks and imported prototypes, the Soviets developed an impressive domestic design and production capability. The T-26 light tank was based on the Vickers E (as were many other tanks of the period), chosen after it beat a Soviet FT derivative in trials. The Soviets purchased some U.S. Christie M1930 tank prototypes, from which they developed the BT series of fast tanks. They also developed the heavier multi-turreted T-28 medium tank and the massive T-35, which followed the design premise of the Vickers A1E1 Independent. Of the tanks produced between 1930 and 1940, 97% were either identical copies of foreign designs, or very closely related improvements. Significantly, the major improvement the Soviet designers made to these foreign designs was an increase in firepower. By 1935, the Red Army \\". . . possessed more armoured vehicles, and more tank units than the rest of the world combined.\\" (Zaloga 1984, p. 107) Soviet T-35 tank But from 1937 to 1941, the Red Army's officer corps, the armour design bureaux, and leadership of the factories were gutted by Stalin's Great Purge. Approximately 54,000 officers were repressed. Military knowledge completely stagnated and armoured vehicle production dropped drastically (though still remaining the world's largest). Training and readiness dropped to very low levels. This repression continued until the eve of the war. The BT-5 Fast Tank; the BT series led to the development of the T-34. The participation by Soviet 'volunteer' tank units in the Spanish Civil War was decisive in forming Soviet tank designs for World War II. Soviet tanks dominated their foreign rivals in Spain due to their firepower, but their thin armor, in common with most tanks of the period, made them vulnerable to the new towed antitank guns being supplied to Infantry units. This finding led directly to a new generation of Soviet tanks. By the eve of World War II, the Soviet Union had some of the world's best tanks (including the T-34 and KV-1, which were basically a generation ahead, coming as a shock to the Wehrmacht). However, the poor training and readiness status of most Red Army units led to a catastrophic defeat of the enormous Soviet Mechanised Corps during the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. Despite their generally good equipment, the Red Army's operational capabilities and motorised logistic support were very inferior.  Czechoslovakia  LT vz. 35 tanks in the ≈†koda Works The Czech Army bought three Carden-Loyd tankettes and a production licence for them in 1930, ƒåeskomoravsk√° Kolben-Danƒõk building four copies that same year as prototypes for future orders. The Carden-Loyds were evaluated during the Fall maneuvers and revealed numerous problems: the crews had very poor vision through the narrow slits, the machine gun had a very narrow field of fire and the crewmen had a difficult time communicating. Furthermore, they were slow, underpowered and often broke down. One of the P-1 prototypes was rebuilt to address these issues with additional vision ports in all directions, internal ammunition storage and the machine gun's field of fire increased to 60¬∞. It was extensively tested during 1931‚Äì32 and a few other changes were made as a result. The armor was increased from and from and a fixed machine gun was added for the driver. Two of the other prototypes were rebuilt to the same standard; all three were officially accepted by the Army on 17 October 1933. The order for seventy was placed on 19 April 1933, all being delivered by October 1934. The ≈†koda T-21 (original designation was ≈†koda ≈†-IIc) was ≈†koda's contribution to the IIc army category (medium tanks for general use) and a direct competitor to Praga V-8-H. In the early thirties both Praga and ≈†koda (main competitors for both Czechoslovak army contracts but also with regard to export) designed some successful light tanks (LT-35, later the LT-38) but both companies produced some unsuccessful infantry support tank designs, notably the Praga P-IIb and ≈†koda ≈†-IIb. Subsequently, both companies worked together to design a joint infantry tank project, designated ≈†P-IIb. Both companies however also continued to work on their own private attempts to build IIb/IIc category prototypes. These private attempts would later become the Praga V-8-H and ≈†koda T-21. The main design works on the T-21 began as early as September 1936. The first prototype was finished in May 1937 and first variant from May 1937 was the original ≈†-IIc. The engine development was delayed and the prototype was fitted (in order to save time) with a 190 hp 13-liter V6, originally intended for the ≈†-III breakthrough tank prototype. In September 1937, the V6 engine was removed and the original ≈†koda engine intended for it was installed. It still failed its tests which were stopped in November, marking the end of the 1st development stage of T-21. By that time the Ministry of Defence committee was looking for a suitable Czechoslovak medium tank for the army but the ≈†-IIc did not to make the June 1938 army tests deadline and as a result this was the end of the T-21 as a potential Czechoslovak army medium tank. In any case, after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia that was no longer possible, not without German consent at least. During the early months of occupation German delegations visited the ≈†koda factory and tests were performed with the ≈†-IIc prototype which, by 22.5.1939, had been renamed, to fit the German nomenclature principles to ≈†koda T-21 (T = tank, 2 = medium, 1 = 1st variant). The Germans initially wanted to test it at Kummersdorf, but did not show too much interest in the design and instead the Germans decided to produce an improved version, which was named T-22. The British Carden-Lloyd Tankette's Czechoslovakia had acquired led to the Czechoslovakia designed tank, the Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33 which was assembled from a framework of steel \\"angle iron\\" beams, to which armor plates were riveted. The front armor was thick, the sides had a thickness of , the top was thick and the bottom plates were in thickness. This was deemed enough to deflect armor-piercing bullets fired from distances greater than from the front and from the sides. Both were supposed to withstand ordinary bullets from over . The , water-cooled, , inline 4-cylinder Praga engine sat directly in the fighting compartment. It had a top speed on the road of . The suspension was a modified version of that used in the Carden-Loyd tankettes. The Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33 (literal translation Tankette model 33) was a Czechoslovak- designed tankette used mainly by Slovakia during World War II. Seventy-four were built. The Germans seized forty when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939; there is no record of their use. The Slovaks captured thirty at the same time when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia. In Slovak service it only saw combat during the Slovak National Uprising. The AH-IV was another Czechoslovak-designed tankette which ƒåeskomoravsk√° Kolben-Danƒõk was determined not to repeat the problems of its earlier Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33 tankette and gave the gunner a turret for better observation and all-around fields of fire for its new AH-IV tankette. It was assembled from a framework of steel \\"angle iron\\" beams, to which armor plates between thick were riveted. The , water-cooled, six-cylinder Praga engine produced at 2500 rpm. It sat in the rear of the fighting compartment and drove the transmission via a drive shaft that ran forward between the driver and commander to the gearbox. It had a top speed on the road of and a range between . The semi-automatic Praga-Wilson transmission had five forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the forward- mounted drive sprocket. The suspension was a smaller version of that used in the Panzerkampfwagen 38(t). A Czech LT vz. 34 in 1935 The LT vz. 34, formally designated as Lehk√Ω Tank vzor 34 (\\"Light Tank Model 34\\") Czechoslovak-designed light tank had been based on that of the Carden-Loyd tankette, of which the Czechs had purchased three, plus a manufacturing license, in 1930. Dissatisfied with the prototypes of the Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33 tankette, the Czech Army decided that it would be easier to design a light tank from scratch rather than modify a tankette chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret. 50 were built, the last of which was delivered during 1936. A LT vz. 38 Czech LTL exported to Peru and designated as LTP The next major tank developed in Czechoslovak service had the formal designation Lehk√Ω (Light) Tank vzor (Model) 35, but was commonly referred to as the LT vz. 35 or LT-35. In German use it was called the Panzerkampfwagen 35(t), commonly shortened to Panzer 35(t) or abbreviated as Pz.Kpfw. 35(t), and this Czechoslovak-designed light tank ended up being used mainly by Nazi Germany during World War II. The letter (t) stood for tschechisch (German: \\"Czech\\"). Four hundred and thirty- four were built; of these the Germans seized two hundred and forty-four when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired fifty-two when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service it saw combat during the early years of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired by 1942. A LT vz. 38 designated as LTH the export version to Switzerland In 1935, the Czechoslovak tank manufacturer ƒåKD was looking for a replacement for the LT-35 tank they were jointly producing with ≈†koda Works. The LT-35 was complex and had shortcomings, and ƒåKD felt there would be orders both from the expanding Czechoslovak army and for export. ƒåKD decided to use a suspension with four large wheels for their new tank. It resembled the Christie suspension outwardly, but was actually a conventional leaf spring unit. The resulting vehicle was reliable and came to be known as LT vz. 38 in Czechoslovak service and designated the Panzer 38(t) in German service. On 1 July 1938, Czechoslovakia ordered 150 of the TNHPS model, which came to be known as the LT vz. 38, and although none had entered service by the time of the German occupation those made were taken over and used by Germany. After the German takeover, Germany ordered continued production of the model as it was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks. It was first introduced into German service under the name LTM 38; this was changed on 16 January 1940 to Panzerkampfwagen 38(t). Production of tanks for Germany continued into 1942, and amounted to more than 1,400 examples. In German service the 38(t) was used as a substitute for the Panzer III.  Germany  Germany, constrained by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, was not allowed to produce tanks of any kind and only a few armoured cars. In 1926 an unofficial program of tank construction was initiated by Von Seeckt, the commander of the Reichswehr. Built by Rheinmetall-Borsig the first Grosstraktor (\\"big tractor\\") was similar to the existing British Mk II medium tank, 20 tons with a 75 mm gun. This, and other designs, were tested with Soviet co-operation at a tank school in the Russian Urals. In Germany proper dummy tanks were used in training, apparently at the instigation of then-Major Heinz Guderian, a staff tactical instructor. Guderian had read Fuller, Liddell-Hart and other tank warfare theorists and he had the support of his commanders to develop his theories into reality.Panzer I Ausf. A in combat during the German invasion of Norway. In 1931 the German General Staff accepted a plan for two types of tank, a medium tank with a 75 mm gun and a lighter vehicle with a 37 mm gun. While design and then construction work was carried out, the German army used a variety of light tanks based on the British Carden Loyd tankette chassis. The early tanks were code-named Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper (La S, \\"agricultural hauler\\"), a designation that lasted until 1938. The first of these light tanks ran in early 1934. It was a five-ton Krupp design which was dubbed the LKA1. The new government approved an initial order for 150 in 1934 as the 1A La S Krupp. Around 1500 of these light tanks were built. Later German tanks received a new designation, Panzerkampfwagen (PzKpfw or PzKw), which means \\"Armoured Fighting Vehicle\\". The first machine to use this was the two-man PzKpfw I Ausf A influenced by the Carden Loyd tankette, and was a 5.4 ton machine with a 3.5-litre 60 hp (45 kW) petrol engine. It had 13 mm of armour and was armed with twin 7.92 mm machine guns. The more common Ausf B was a little larger to accommodate a 100 hp (75 kW) Maybach engine. Both models were sent to the Spanish Civil War for testing, along with other new German weapons. From the experiences in Spain it quickly became clear that the next generation of tanks would need better armour, greater range and much heavier weapons. Panzer II tanks cross the desert The PzKpfw II was around 50% heavier than the PzKpfw I. It had a 20 mm Solothurn antitank gun as main armament, as well as improved armour of up to 30 mm. Also sent to Spain from 1937, the PzKpfw II proved more capable against light infantry, but no better when faced with capable anti- tank guns or other tanks. Despite these weaknesses, production continued until 1941. At the outbreak of war, the German Army had 955 PzKpfw IIs and almost 4000 were built in total. Panzer 35(t) in France, 1940 A major boost to German armour came with the annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, giving Germany access to the entire Czech arms industry. The Czechs had two light tank designs later used by the Germans, the ≈†koda LT-35 and the ƒåeskomoravsk√° Kolben-Danƒõk (ƒåKD) TNHP. The ≈†koda was a 10-ton machine with a 37 mm main gun and excellent cross-country capabilities; the ƒåKD was 8.5 tons and also fitted with a 37 mm gun‚Äîdue to extensive tests it was an extremely reliable machine with a top quality chassis. Both were taken into the German panzer forces, as the PzKpfw 35(t) and the PzKpfw 38(t), and further production was ordered. ƒåKD was renamed Boehmisch-Maehrische Maschinenfabrik AG (BMM) in 1940 and continued production until 1942, providing the Wehrmacht with 1,168 PzKpfw 38(t) tanks. In 1940, Czech tanks made up around a quarter of the entire German panzer force. German Panzer III Ausf. D tank, in Poland (1939) While lighter tanks formed almost the entirety of the German forces, heavier tanks were at least at the prototype stage. In 1934, a number of heavy prototypes were constructed, based around either 75 or 105 mm main guns. Designated Neubaufahrzeug (NbFz) and very similar to contemporary Soviet and British designs, six were built by Rheinmetall and Krupp. Although they were mainly useful for propaganda purposes because only a handful of the tanks were made, three were actually used in combat in Norway. The knowledge of the NbFz and the experiences of the lighter tanks in Spain aided in designing the next generation of tanks, the PzKpfw III and PzKpfw IV. The PzIII was the lighter of the two and was intended for use in anti-tank operations, whereas the heavier PzIV was armed with a short-barrel gun and intended for supporting infantry. Panzer IV Ausf. C The Panzer III's 37 mm gun was considered underpowered, yet it was used in the interests of standardisation with the infantry. Contracts for the Zugf√ºhrerwagen (ZW, \\"platoon leader vehicle\\") were issued late in 1936. Its weight was limited to a maximum of 24 tons, because it was required to be able to cross existing bridges. Development work continued until 1938 when the Ausf D went into limited production. This 19 ton machine was powered by a 12-litre 320 hp (239 kW) engine. It had a top speed of 25 mph (40 km/h) and was fitted with 30 mm armour all round. By the outbreak of war, around fifty had been completed and some saw service in Poland. Full-scale production did not begin until October 1939 as the Ausf E. Around 350 PzKpfw IIIs in the E variant were ready by the invasion of France.  Japan  Whippets. Like the US Army, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) did not have tanks of its own in World War I, so initially it started out by purchasing foreign tanks for evaluation, and then began developing its own designs. After the war, a few Whippets (six) were exported to Japan, where they remained in service until around 1930.Crow, p. 2. Japanese Type 89 I-Go tanks moving toward Manila, January 1942. In 1925, in addition to tankettes, the Japanese Army began to design tanks to satisfy its own requirements. Before that year, as with most nations, all tanks in Japanese service had been of foreign design and/or manufacture. The first Japanese design was finished in May 1926 and the prototype Type 87 Chi-I medium tank was completed by February 1927. After trials, the Chi-I was considered too heavy and slow to be used as its main tank. It was decided to create a new design modeled after the Vickers Medium C, which had been bought by the Japanese Army in March 1927. By 1929 the prototype of the Type 89 Chi-Ro (Experimental Tank Number 2) was completed. The Type 89 Chi-Ro tank was lighter (9.8 tonnes) and shorter than the Chi-I. It contained increased armour (6 to 17 mm) and an improved water- cooled engine. After success in initial tests, the Type 89 became the first mass-produced Japanese tank. The Type 89 had a crew of four, and was armed with a 57 mm Type 90 gun and two 6.5 mm type 91 machine guns. The second version of this tank known as the Type89B Otsu used a diesel engine. The Japanese were among the first to use diesel engines in their tank designs. Japanese Type 95 Ha-Go first prototype, 1934 During the 1930s, the Japanese began production of tankettes and light tanks, which were used heavily in Manchuria and China. The Type 94 tankette weighed 3.4 tonnes and was generally used as either a tractor to tow an ammunition trailer, or as a patrol/reconnaissance tank. With a crew of two men and a single 6.5 mm type 91 machine gun, 823 units of the Type 94 were produced and they saw widespread service as late as 1945. Over twice as large as the Type 94 at (7.4 tonnes), the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank had a complement of three crewmen, a 37 mm gun and the same 6.5 mm type 91 machine gun, and most importantly a diesel engine which would later greatly influence future tank designs in the Soviet Army. Over two-thousand Type 95 tanks were built, and production continued until 1943. By 1936 the Japanese Army started to look for a replacement for the Type 89. The new medium tank, Type 97 Chi-Ha, was introduced in 1937. The Type 97 Chi-Ha at 15 tonnes was armed with a low-velocity 57 mm gun and had armour up to 25 mm thick. Later, an improved version known as the Type 97 Shinhoto Chi- Ha remained in production until 1943. Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank The 1930s were the last time that the Japanese military focused on production and design of tanks before World War II. After that period, they were largely preoccupied with establishing naval control and their focus was on production of ships and aircraft. Furthermore, with the emphasis on expansion southward into the Pacific Ocean region, land battles would be largely replaced by naval warfare, and thus, with the exception of small islands, the domain of the Imperial Japanese Navy. With the destruction of the Imperial Navy, the focus on tanks returned when the Japanese military prepared for the defense of the mainland in the last years of World War II.  United States  After World War I, and still using British and French designs, the United States Tank Corps was reduced in size. Renaults and the new Mk VIII \\"Liberty Tank\\" were retained:https://web.archive.org/web/20080929193938/http://www.ftmeade.army.mil/Museum/Exhibit_MarkVIII_Tank.html The Defense Act of 1920 restricted tanks to infantry use only; as a result, the Tank Corps was disbanded, with the remaining tanks distributed among the infantry. In 1928, at the request of Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis, the Army formed the Experimental Mechanized Brigade. It consisted of a heavy tank battalion, a light tank battalion, a motorised infantry battalion, a motorised artillery battalion, an engineer company, and a signals company. Due to the use of obsolete equipment, the experiment failed, and the force was disbanded after three months. A M1 Combat Car. In 1934‚Äì35, at the request of the Cavalry, three prototype tanks, the T2, T2E1, and T2E2 were produced. Under the terms of the Defense Act of 1920, tanks were restricted to infantry units. To get around the Defense Act, these tanks were called \\"combat cars\\". The M1 series entered service in 1937. The T2, inspired by the British Vickers 6-Ton, was standardised as the M1 combat car. The T2E1, a single-turret tank armed with three machine guns, was standardised as the M2A1. The T2E2, a two-turret tank with two machine guns, was standardised as the M2A2. M2 tank. Throughout the interwar period the US produced only a few hundred tanks. From the end of World War I to 1935, only 15 tanks were produced. Most were derivatives or foreign designs or very poor quality private designs. The Christie designs were among the few bright spots, but the US Army acquired only three Christies and did not pursue the idea any further. Budget limitations and the low priority given to the Army meant that there were few resources for building tanks. The US Army instead developed and tested tank components such as suspensions, tracks, and transmissions. This work paid off when production needed to be initiated upon the outbreak of war. Immediately before and during World War II, U.S tanks and many other Allied tanks were powered by radial aircraft-type engines. However, the massive production of aircraft caused a shortage of these engines. Because of this, many tanks, particularly the Sherman and the Lee, were powered by as many as five different power-plant arrangements. In addition to Wright and Continental radials, they were powered by Ford GAA, GM truck diesels, and the Chrysler A57 multibank (an arrangement of five 6-cylinder automobile engines that ran as a single unit). After the war, diesel truck-type engines replaced the gasoline- burning radials.  Others  Polish 7TP tank. Many other nations that desired tanks could not design or build their own. The 1920s and 1930s saw a widespread export business as smaller or less-industrialized nations purchased tanks abroad. Sometimes, the import of foreign tanks led to the birth of a tank industry in the importing nation. Poland imported the British Vickers Six-Ton tank and began production of improved models. The pinnacle of this improvement program was the 7TP, which featured a diesel engine and 37 mm gun. Poland also produced the TKS series of tankettes, similar in concept to the Vickers-Carden-Loyd machinegun carriers of Britain and the UE of France. These vehicles had two-man crews, thin armor, and a single ball-mounted light machinegun. Turkey imported Soviet T-26 and a few T-28 tanks but did not begin series production of any tank. L-60 Toldi light tank based on Sweden's L-60 Sweden's Landsverk firm designed several advanced light tanks, including the 20 mm armed L-60, which also had welded construction and some sloped armor. The L-60 was adopted as the Toldi light tank by Hungary. With its 20 mm gun it was roughly comparable to the German Panzer II or Soviet T-60. The L-60 was also the chassis on which the Landsverk L-62 self-propelled 40 mm anti-aircraft gun was built. Although designed as tank destroyer, the vehicle saw service with Hungarian forces on the Eastern Front as a self- propelled anti-aircraft gun under the name Nimrod. Six were used by Finland after 1942. Hungary produced the Toldi as well as a medium tank, the Turan. The Turan I was based on a prototype of Czech medium tank ≈†koda T-21 (≈†-II-c), had rivetted construction, and a 40 mm gun. The later Turan II had a 75 mm gun. During World War II these tanks were supplemented by several dozen imported German vehicles. Latvia and Lithuania imported a few light vehicles such as Vickers-Carden-Loyd tankettes, FT-17s, and Six-Tonners. CV-35-L3/35 in the Balkans. Romania imported some R-35 light tanks from France, as well as some Panzer 35(t)s. Italy imported the French FT-17 and produced a slightly improved clone, the Fiat 3000. A native Italian design was the L6/40, a very small light tank with a 20 mm Breda cannon and rivetted construction. A medium tank, based on the Vickers Six-Tonner, was the M-11-M13 series. This tank had a very good 47 mm gun, but very thin armor. Italy also produced a large number of CV-33 and CV-35 tankettes based on the Vickers-Carden-Loyd concept. In Latin America, the first war where the tank was employed was the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay, in which the former used a small number of British-built tanks and tankettes, whereas the latter had no tanks at all.

Girard. On January 30, 1957, the 46-year-old Sakai was collecting scrap metal on a U.S. Army shooting range in Soumagahara, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Sakai, a mother of six, earned a living selling scrap metal, and had entered the Army area for the purpose of collecting spent rifle cartridges. Specialist Third Class Girard, a 21-year-old enlisted man from Ottawa, Illinois, used a grenade launcher mounted on an M1 rifle to fire an empty casing at Sakai, which killed her.Harnisch, Larry. \\"Soldier kills woman\\", Los Angeles Times, retrieved November 27, 2007. Extradition and controversy The strong Japanese outcry over the killing led to a jurisdictional dispute between the Japanese authorities and the U.S. Army. The Army maintained that Girard had acted while on duty and was thus under the jurisdiction of U.S. military courts, while the Japanese government held that Girard's actions had taken place during a period of rest, making him subject to Japanese law. Girard had been assigned to guard a machine gun at the firing range in between sessions of target practice; the Japanese contention was that since Girard had not fired a weapon during exercises, he could not be considered as actively on duty. Eventually, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson ruled that Girard's specific action \\"was not authorized\\", and he was turned over for trial.\\"The Girard Case\\", Time, October 7, 1957, retrieved December 14, 2007. Girard appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, but the Court rejected his request for intervention. American response to Girard's extradition was largely negative. Relatives and supporters in his Illinois hometown drummed up 182 feet of signatures for a petition decrying the decision, the American Legion protested vociferously, the Veterans of Foreign Wars said that Girard had been \\"sold down the river\\", Senator John Bricker of Ohio called the decision a matter of \\"sacrificing an American soldier to appease Japanese public opinion\\", and the New York Daily News summed up its feelings in a headline: \\"To the Wolves, Soldier\\". In the midst of the uproar, the New York Times, fearing that American reaction was eroding the good will earned in Asia by the initial decision to extradite, published an article lauding the positive interactions between most U.S. soldiers and Japanese civilians, including photographs of soldiers celebrating Christmas with a Japanese family while clothed in traditional Japanese attire. Trial At the trial, a Japanese witness for the prosecution asserted that Girard had yelled a warning to Sakai before firing, but Girard himself denied ever having done so, a statement which shocked and mystified observers. According to testimony from Victor Nickel, a soldier of the same rank who had accompanied him, Girard had lured Sakai and other scavengers toward his position by tossing empty casings out onto the range, then fired at Sakai \\"for a joke\\".\\"The Girard Case (Contd.)\\", Time, October 7, 1957, retrieved December 14, 2007. Girard claimed that the death had been an accident. The presiding judge, Yuzo Kawachi, went so far as to visit the scene of the incident himself, and pronounced himself \\"baffled\\" by the discrepancies in Girard's account of events. However, he stated that he could find \\"no evidence of deliberate murder\\", and Girard was handed only a three-year suspended sentence. He was also demoted to private status by the U.S. Army as a result of his actions; had he been found guilty of murder, he would have been dishonorably discharged. Aftermath Girard, who was recorded as having an IQ of 90, was held in little regard by his fellow soldiers, widely viewed as a \\"bumpkin clown\\" who drank to excess and ran up debts at various Japanese establishments. After his trial, he went home to America with his Taiwan-born Japanese bride, Haru \\"Candy\\" Sueyama, and was repeatedly booed by fellow servicemen during his return trip. Sakai's widowed husband, Akikichi, and his six children were compensated with US $1,748.32 (US$ in ) for their loss, but this monetary offer was perceived as an attempt to buy off justice by many Japanese, and Akikichi stated to U.S. authorities that \\"I do not thank you for it.\\" Notes External links * Supreme Court ruling * Time Magazine article * President Eisenhower's letter to Girard's mother Category:1957 crimes in Japan Category:Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:United States military in Japan Category:United States military scandals Category:Murder in Japan ","title":"Girard incident"},{"id":"2995917","text":"William Lance LeGaultProfile, google.com; accessed November 8, 2015. (May 2, 1935 ‚Äì September 10, 2012), sometimes credited as W. L. LeGault, was an American film and television actor, best known as U.S. Army Colonel Roderick Decker in the 1980s American television series The A-Team. Personal life LeGault was born May 2, 1935 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Mary Jean (n√©e Kovachevich; died December 21, 1980) and Ernest Legault (1906‚Äì1941). LeGault's father, Ernest, was French-Canadian from Moose Creek, Ontario, Canada. LeGault's mother, Mary, was born in Illinois, the daughter of immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The family was poor. He lived in an orphanage for a time between his father's death in 1941 and when his mother remarried in 1943. He started working at 11, and was fired from the railroad at 13 when they discovered he was not 18 as he had claimed. He grew up in Chillicothe, Illinois and graduated from Chillicothe Township High School in 1955. He received a full football scholarship to the Municipal University of Wichita, where he majored in business administration for two years before dropping out to pursue a music career. Career LeGault's first three feature films were Elvis Presley movies, Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962) in which he was a stunt double for Elvis Presley, Kissin' Cousins (1964), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). He also appeared in Presley's 1968 NBC television special Elvis (also known as Elvis' 68 Comeback Special), where he sat at the side of the stage playing a tambourine. He appeared in Roustabout, another Presley film, as a carnival barker. In 1969, he appeared as Iago in the UK stage version of Jack Good's Catch My Soul: Rock Othello, and played Iago again in the 1974 Metromedia film version of Catch My Soul. He starred in television series and in television movies and was known mainly for portraying military personnel, especially officers. His best known television role was in the 1980s series The A-Team as Colonel Roderick Decker‚Äîa United States Army colonel who tried to catch the fugitive Vietnam veterans. He played the role of Colonel Decker from 1983‚Äì86. He also had a recurring role in another 1980s hit television series, Magnum, P.I., as a United States Marine Corps colonel, Colonel \\"Buck\\" Greene. LeGault was on screen in a variety of programs including the short lived series Werewolf in 1987. In 1980, he starred with Kenny Rogers in the television movie The Gambler. He made a few appearances on the second season of Dynasty as gangster Ray Bonning. He appeared on Knight Rider in the pilot episode \\"Knight of the Phoenix\\" and appeared (as a different character) in the season 2 episode \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\"; and played three different characters in Airwolf (in To Snare a Wolf, Sweet Britches as villains, and Wildfire in a comparatively rare good guy role) as well as doing the voice-overs for the series' 1st Season \\"saga sell\\" teasers. He guest-starred on yet another hit 1980s television series Dallas as Al Halliday in 1989. In 1984 he also starred in Murder, She Wrote, Season 4 Episode 20. Often playing stern colonels, the low-pitched, gravelly-voiced actor portrayed Colonel Glass in the 1981 comedy Stripes, starring Bill Murray and John Candy.

He appeared on Land of the Giants in the first-season episode \\"Underground\\" as a police officer. LeGault's last role was in the 2013 film Prince Avalanche, and the film is dedicated to him. Voicework On the Knight Rider season 1 DVD pilot commentary, creator Glen A. Larson mentioned that Lance LeGault had \\"a voice that was four octaves lower than God's.\\" This trait helped him obtain roles (often) as a villain or other \\"tough guy\\". It also resulted in a side career doing voice-over work. LeGault's trademark voice was at one point featured on self-guided tour cassettes at Elvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee. For many years in the 1980s, LeGault voiced programme trailers for ABC. In the video game world, he was heard as the voice of Major Manson in the 1998 video game Battlezone II: Combat Commander. He provided the voice of Junior the Buffalo in Disney's Home on the Range (2004). He also voiced Yank Justice in the nine-episode, 30-minute 1985 series Bigfoot and the Muscle Machines, part of Marvel Productions' Super Sunday block. From 2009 to 2010, he performed voiceover work for Burger King, with the then-new \\"Angry Whopper\\" burger. Other voice- over work on commercials included Dodge and 7-Up.

It is a former estate garden featuring annuals, roses and wildflowers and an extensive rockery. It is located on Wilket Creek, one of the tributaries of the Don River West Branch. The estate's title was once held by Alexander Milne, a Scottish weaver who settled there after the War of 1812 and left in 1832. Although the property remained in the Milne family, it was left in neglect. The land and the woollen/saw mills were bought by Rupert E. Edwards in 1944 and he created a magnificent garden there. He sold the property to the Municipality of Metro Toronto in 1955 to become a public park, and it became Edwards Gardens in 1956. Toronto Botanical Garden (formerly Civic Garden Centre) relocated into the Milne home on the site in 1959. Edwards Gardens is one of several parks located along Toronto's ravines, many of which are connected by hiking and cycling trails, and connected to the shores of Lake Ontario. The park's manicured lawns and flower beds make it a popular destination for wedding parties to take photographs. In 2013, Edwards Gardens won an Award of Excellence under the Regional Citation (New Directions) category from the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects for their sustainably designed parking lot. Following the example of some botanical gardens, Edwards Gardens put an accent on cheaper landscaping and event hosting instead of living collections, which tend to be neglected. However, most important botanical gardens consider living collections as a major conservation piece and their importance only grows as more and more wild species are threatened by climate change and by habitat loss due to human expansion.

The series aired on TLC from October to December 2005. Overview Before gaining celebrity on Loveline and The Man Show, Carolla worked as a carpenter for several years. In this series, he returns to the profession by purchasing his father's house on Hartsook Street in Village Valley, California for $739,500 and paying all expenses out of his own pocket to have it renovated. The show co-stars friends from his construction days (\\"my band of unemployable idiots\\"), who do much of the renovation. The footage is a mix of celebreality television and real-life construction. The team became known for its laziness despite being on camera the entire day. They failed four of five initial building inspections, installed the pool incorrectly, showed up late, slept on the job, got high on the job, skinny- dipped on the job, and poured condiments on one another's heads. Early in the project, their tools were stolen. Later on, personal friction led several of them to quit, only to be cajoled back to the site by Carolla. One architectural innovation featured on the show (Episode 12, aired 20 Dec 2005) is noteworthy: the Recyclarolla. The device consists of a 3-inch PVC pipe fitted inside a kitchen cabinet at an approximately 30-degree downward angle. The end of the pipe emerges from the outer wall, about 40 cm above the ground. Positioned under the hole is a recycling bin. The pipe conveys empty bottles and cans from the kitchen directly into the recycling bin outside. The name was coined by Jimmy Kimmel, who has one installed in his home. Survivor host Jeff Probst is also said to be a fan of the Recyclarolla. =Finale= The two-part season finale aired on December 20, 2005, and included both the last weeks of construction on the house and the sale of the house for $1,008,000. Property records indicate a final sale price of $990,000 however. The last episode featured several scenes in which Carolla was considering the purchase of another house, suggesting that Carolla and his crew might be back for a second season.

Elected to the Kentucky state house before the American Civil War, he was commissioned as a Union officer when he volunteered, advancing to the rank of brigadier general before he resigned to go to Congress. He was promoted to Major General by brevet on March 13, 1865. He was elected to the US Congress from Kentucky in 1862 representing the Unionist Party, serving until 1866. That year, Smith was appointed as the Territorial Governor of Montana, serving from 1866 to 1869. He returned to Washington, D.C., where he was ordained as a Baptist minister and became active in the temperance movement. Biography Smith was born in 1826 in Richmond, Kentucky to John Speed Smith and his wife Elizabeth Lewis (Clay) Smith (1798-1887)\\"KOAR's Russian Connection\\", Kentucky Online Arts Resource Blog, 15 October 2012 as the third of seven children. He was named for his maternal grandfather, Green Clay, a very wealthy planter and slaveholder in Kentucky and a prominent politician. His siblings included Sally Ann Lewis (1818-1875), named for her maternal grandmother; Curran Cassius, Pauline Green, Junius Brutus (never married), Mary Spencer (never married), and John Speed, Jr.Thomas Speed, Records and Memorials of the Speed Family, Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, 1892, pp. 88-89 Smith's father was elected to the Kentucky legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. His mother's younger brothers, Brutus J. Clay and Cassius M. Clay, both became state politicians and were later elected as members of the Unionist Party to the US Congress from Kentucky during the American Civil War. Cassius became known as an abolitionist before the war. As a young man, Green Clay Smith pursued academic studies. When the U.S.-Mexican War began, he enlisted in the Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the First Regiment of the Kentucky Volunteer Infantry on June 9, 1846. Smith returned to Kentucky, where he graduated from Transylvania University in 1849, then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1852. He began his practice in Covington. From 1853 to 1857, Smith served as a school commissioner. Career =Congressman= Smith was elected as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving from 1861 to 1863. On April 4, 1862, he was commissioned colonel of the Fourth Regiment of the Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers on June 12, 1862.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 728. Like his uncles Brutus J. and Cassius M. Clay, Smith joined the Unionist Party. In 1862, he was elected as an Unconditional Unionist to the thirty-eighth congress, resigning from his military post on December 1, 1863. He served as chairman of the Committee on Militia from 1865 to 1866. He was brevetted major general of volunteers on March 13, 1865. =Governor= Smith resigned from Congress in July 1866 when President Andrew Johnson appointed him as Territorial Governor of Montana. He served there from 1866 to 1869, working to moderate hostilities between European American settlers and the Native Americans who occupied the lands, including tribes of the Blackfoot Confederacy. =Pastor= After he resigned, Smith returned to Washington, D.C.. He was ordained to the Baptist ministry and served in a number of congregations while supporting the temperance movement. He was pastor in Richmond, Mt. Sterling, Frankfort and Louisville, Kentucky. In 1890 he was called as pastor of the Metropolitan Baptist Church (now Capitol Hill Baptist Church) in Washington, D.C., which he served until his death in 1895.Speed (1892), Records and Memorials, p. 92 =Presidential nomination= In 1876, the National Prohibition Party nominated Smith for President of the United States. With his running mate, Gideon T. Stewart, the two received 9,737 popular votes in the election. Smith continued his work in religion and temperance.

A gas such as argon is introduced in very small quantities into the chamber, where it becomes charged or ionized through interactions with the free electrons from the cathode, forming a plasma. The plasma is then accelerated through a series of at least two highly charged grids, and becomes an ion beam, moving at fairly high speed from the aperture of the device. History Prof. Dr. Manfred von Ardenne, June 1986 The duoplasmatron was first developed in 1956 by Manfred von Ardenne to provide a powerful source for gas ions. Other contributors such as Demirkanov, Frohlich and Kistemaker continued development between 1959 and 1965. Throughout the 1960s, many continued to investigate, discovering negative ion extraction and multiply charged ion production. There are two types of plasmatrons, the uniplasmatron and the duoplasmatron. The prefix refers to the constriction of discharge.  Operation  The standard duoplasmatron consists of three main components that are responsible for its operation. These include the hot cathode, the intermediate electrode, and the anode. The intermediate electrode's main job is to produce discharge. This discharge is confined into a small portion near the anode and a short magnetic field between the intermediate electrode and the anode. The duoplasmatron has two different types of plasma: the cathode plasma which is close to the cathode and the anode plasma that is close to the anode. The cathode works by injecting a beam of electrons with a suitable amount of energy. This injection ionizes the gas molecules, typically Argon gas, in the anode and increases the potential near the anode. The ions that are repulsed, however, combine with the ions that contain enough energy to pass the deceleration region and this combination of ions fill the expansion cup with directed ions and electrons. The best operational mode for the duoplasmatron is considered to be when the cathode is adjusted to an emission where the intermediate electrode and the cathode potential are approximately equal.  Applications  The duoplasmatron is a type of ion source. Ion sources are necessary to form ions for mass spectrometers and other types of instruments. In comparison to Penning ionization sources, the duoplasmatron features advantages such as less expenditure, easier handling, and a longer lifetime. However, the duoplasmatron does have lower beam intensity, which can be a large disadvantage.

He was born in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, and is considered the fastest pre-independence Indian pace bowler. He was arguably one of the fastest bowlers in the world during his time. Indian batsman C.K. Nayudu claimed in writings that during his first spell, Nissar was faster than Englishman Harold Larwood, who terrorized Australia in 1932 in the infamous Bodyline series. Nissar along with Amar Singh formed an Indian fast bowling duo that was considered one of the best in the world during the 1930s. He was one of the founders of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). He immigrated to Pakistan in 1947 and died in Lahore in 1963. Career The 1932 Indian Test Cricket team that toured England. Mohammad Nissar seen standing fourth on this photo of the team captained by Maharaja of Porbandar. Mohammed Nissar was drafted into the Indian team which toured England in 1932. He was a part of the side which contained players like CK Nayudu, the brothers Wazir Ali and Nazir Ali, and of course, his famous bowling partner, Amar Singh. Even today, Nissar's main claim to fame was of being the first man to take a wicket for India, and for being the fastest pre-war bowler India have produced. Nissar's career kick-started right in his first match, as he, in the first ball of his second over, dismissed Herbert Sutcliffe for 3, knocking over Sutcliffe's stumps. Then, with the fifth ball of the very same over, he bowled the other opener, Percy Holmes.Wisden ‚Äì England v India 1932. Espncricinfo.com (30 July 2007). Retrieved on 2018-05-11. What made this fact extraordinary was that Holmes and Sutcliffe were involved in an opening stand of 555 for Yorkshire just ten days ago.Indian Cricket Fever ‚Äì Fast bowling legacy: Nissar and Amar Singh. Cricketnetwork.co.uk (10 June 2003). Retrieved on 2018-05-11. In the course of his 26-over spell, Nissar scalped five wickets for 93 runs, as England were skittled for 259, a below-par score for a team that had looked much stronger on paper. In the second innings, Nissar bowled 18 overs and took a wicket, of Walter Robins, who was a victim of his in the first innings as well, for 42 runs. Overall, with a strike rate of 44, and with match figures of 6 for 135, Nissar gave a glimpse of other performances England should have watched out for when he played them. That was to be the only test match for India that year, but there were many other first-class matches on the tour, where Nissar grabbed 71 wickets at an average of 18.09. In 1935‚Äì36, when Jack Ryder's Australian XI toured India to play against Maharaja \\"Vizzy\\" Vizianagaram's Indian team, he made a mark there too, taking 32 wickets in 4 unofficial tests. Nissar's last test was against England in August 1936, at The Oval, where he managed to take six wickets, including a five wicket haul, even though India lost the match.Statsguru, bowling innings list.

This was a common problem when listening to music from the phone while the phone was in a pocket. The more stable 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm audio sockets aren't prone to such problems. The contacts are exposed to dust and dirt, more so than those of a TRRS socket. This, combined with the small size of the contacts, prevented connections in some cases.

The Army of the West, also known as the Trans-Mississippi District, was a formation of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War that was a part of the Army of Mississippi. It saw action in the Battle of Pea Ridge, Battle of Corinth, and Battle of Iuka and consisted of about 20,000 personnel. History =Pea Ridge campaign= During 1861, Confederate forces in Missouri and Arkansas were divided into two independent commands: Major General Sterling Price's pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard, based in southwestern Missouri, and Major General Benjamin McCulloch's Confederate volunteers, based in northwestern Arkansas and the Indian Territory. Both Price and McCulloch feuded with each other concerning the proper Confederate strategy in the Trans-Mississippi area, and cooperated only once, during the Wilson's Creek campaign in August 1861.Shea & Hess, pp. 2, 19. During February 1862, the Union Army of the Southwest commanded by Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis drove the Missouri State Guard out of the state and into northwestern Arkansas, where Price united with McCulloch's forces. The Confederates settled into winter quarters in the northern Boston Mountains, where Price immediately started feuding with McCulloch again. Price also started the process of enlisting his men from the Missouri State Guard into the Confederate volunteer army but the process was slow and only one brigade was organized onto complete regiments by March; another brigade was composed only of battalions and a third of partial organized battalions and companies.Josephy, pp. 336-338. To solve the problem of having two feuding commanders in Arkansas, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Major General Earl Van Dorn to command the District of the Trans-Mississippi, which covered Missouri, Arkansas, the Indian Territory, and northern Louisiana; the district was part of the Confederate Department No. 2, commanded by General Albert Johnston. Once he arrived in Arkansas, Van Dorn designated each command a division and enlisted additional troops, organizing them into the 19th and 20th Arkansas Infantry regiments. He also ordered Brigadier General Albert Pike to bring his brigade from the Indian Territory to Arkansas but only two regiments (the 1st and 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles) reached Van Dorn's army before the campaign started.Shea & Hess, pp. 23-25, 58. Van Dorn launched his offensive on March 5; when he discovered that Curtis was positioned behind fortifications located along the Little Sugar Creek, Van Dorn decided to march around the Union left flank and attack from the rear, starting the flanking march during the night of March 6-7\\\\. There was a delay as the Confederates had to construct a bridge over the Little Sugar Creek; by morning Price's division arrived at the Telegraph Road north of Curtis's fortifications, with McCulloch behind him and a rocky ridge called Big Mountain between the Confederates and the Union army. At this time, McCulloch received permission to head around the southern shoulder of Big Mountain and meet up with Price near Elkhorn Tavern, since this would shorten the distance he would travel. However, a portion of the Union army, commanded by Brigadier General Franz Sigel intercepted McCulloch's men near the southwest corner of Big Mountain. While an attack by Pike's brigade and Brigadier General James McIntosh's cavalry brigade drove back the Union forces from their initial positions, McCulloch was killed while scouting the second Union line, McIntosh was killed while leading a regiment into position, and Union reinforcements routed McCulloch's infantry brigade and captured its leader, Colonel Louis Hebert.Shea & Hess, p. 87; Josephy, pp. 343-344. Pike was able to rally a portion of the division and lead it back to the Bentonville Detour, where it marched around the northern end of Big Mountain and to Elkhorn Tavern. Colonel Elkanah Greer of the 3rd Texas Cavalry took command of another portion of the division and, after holding his position until after dark, also marched around Big Mountain to the tavern.Shea & Hess, pp. 210-211. Meanwhile, Price's force, accompanied by Van Dorn, arrived near Elkhorn Tavern to find Colonel Eugene Carr's Union division defending the crest. Price deployed the State Guard on his left and the Missouri Confederate brigades on the right; following an artillery bombardment, he ordered a charge. The Confederates were able to drive back the Union line and capture a cannon but couldn't rout Carr's division; one of Price's brigade commanders was killed and Price himself was wounded twice but not seriously enough to leave the field.Josephy, pp. 344-345. During the night, the remains of McCulloch's division arrived at Elkhorn Tavern but no supplies came, since the supply train was located several miles away at the initial Confederate positions and Van Dorn failed to order it to follow the army; as a result, the Confederates were low on ammunition.Shea & Hess, pp. 214-215. Curtis concentrated his army around the Confederate positions near Elkhorn Tavern during the night; at dawn he started an artillery bombardment which lasted two hours. Due to having no ammunition reserves nearby, the Confederates soon ran very low on artillery shells and couldn't resupply for at least five or six hours. Van Dorn ordered his army to retreat towards the east before moving southwards. Neither Van Dorn nor Price remained behind to supervise the retreat, so the units left the field chaotically, with the artillery batteries leaving as they ran out of ammunition and the infantry and cavalry regiments following.Shea & Hess, pp. 236, 239-240. Once the army arrived at Van Buren, Van Dorn reorganized it into a single division under Price, with four infantry brigades, two cavalry brigades, and an artillery brigade. At this time, General P. G. T. Beauregard, acting for Johnston, ordered Van Dorn to bring his army to Corinth, Mississippi to join Johnston's force for an attack on the Union army at Shiloh. However, due to bad roads Van Dorn failed to reach Corinth until a week after the Battle of Shiloh; in addition, Van Dorn brought all supplies he could, including the machinery and stores at the Little Rock arsenal, to northern Mississippi with him, and left few men behind.Shea & Hess, pp. 285, 287, 289. =Iuka-Corinth Campaign= Following the transfer of the Army of the West to Corinth, part of the army was incorporated into the Army of Mississippi. The remaining units were reorganized by Price into two divisions commanded by Brigadier Generals Henry Little and Dabney Maury, with a cavalry brigade commanded by Colonel Frank Armstrong. As part of the preparations for the Perryville campaign, the new commander of Department No. 2, General Braxton Bragg, divided Mississippi into several commands to defend the state in his absence. Van Dorn was appointed commander of the District of the Mississippi, centered around Vicksburg; Price was given the District of the Tennessee, covering northwestern Mississippi and northeastern Alabama, with the Army of the West as his field army. Price was ordered to hold the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and prevent the Union forces in western Tennessee, commanded by U. S. Grant and William S. Rosecrans, from reinforcing the Union army in Kentucky, with Van Dorn to cooperate with Price. Initially, Van Dorn refused to unite his force with Price's, instead concentrating on recapturing Baton Rouge, Louisiana; when that attack failed, Van Dorn reconsidered Price's proposal of invading the Union held territory.Cozzens, p. 39, 42-43, 59-60. In the meantime, Price launched an offensive without waiting for Van Dorn's forces, mostly due to pressure from Bragg. He captured without a fight the town of Iuka on September 14, along with many supplies abandoned by the Union garrison. Grant and Rosecrans immediately formed a plan of trapping Price, with Grant moving in from the northwest to hold Price's attention, while Rosecrans attacked from the south and southwest to cut off Price's lines of retreat. The two columns reached Iuka on September 19 but due to poor communications and misunderstanding, Grant failed to attack as planned. This enabled Price to concentrate on Rosecrans, resulting in the Battle of Iuka; the Confederates overpowered the initial Union line and held it against Union counterattacks. Upon learning of Grant's approach, Price decided to retreat to avoid being surrounded; total Confederate casualties were 652, with Little killed and succeeded by Brigadier General Louis Hebert.Cozzens, pp. 50, 56-57, 63-65, 70, 74-115, 133. Uniting with Van Dorn at Ripley, Mississippi on September 28, Price placed himself under Van Dorn's command. The Army of the West was redesignated Price's Corps, which with Mansfield Lovell's division from the District of the Mississippi, formed Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee. (Lovell's division remained separate from Price's corps and reported directly to Van Dorn.) Van Dorn then informed Price of his plans to capture Corinth: first the Confederates would march to Pocahontas, northwest of Corinth, in order to confuse the Union high command, then turn around and attack Corinth from the north and northwest. Although opposed to the plan, Price went along with it. During the two‚Äëday Battle of Corinth, Price's corps did much of the fighting. On the first day, Price's troops drove the Union troops from their lines north of Corinth into their second line of fortifications; on the second, his divisions overran several parts of the Union line and briefly entered into Corinth but had to fall back due to lack of support. Hebert reported himself sick on the morning of the second day and was replaced by Brigadier General Martin E. Green; in addition, several field officers were killed or wounded during the battle. During both days, Lovell failed to fully support Price's attacks, which may have been due to his opposition to attacking Corinth at all.Cozzens, pp. 136-140, 175-193, 203-213, 237-268, 271, 306. Van Dorn ordered a retreat first towards Pocahontas, where he proposed for the Confederate army to attack Corinth again from the south; both Price and Maury talked him out of it. The retreat continued westward, with Lovell's division serving as a rearguard against Rosecrans and Price's divisions in front. On the morning of October 6, Van Dorn learned that another Union force commanded by Stephen Hulbut was approaching from the west; he assigned Maury's division to hold the Davis Bridge over the Hatchie River until the army could reach another crossing six miles to the south. Maury formed a line on the west side of the creek but the line was overrun with the loss of 300 prisoners. Hulbut then crossed several regiments to the east bank, which suffered 570 casualties, mostly due to sharpshooters and artillery fire. Once a temporary bridge was built across the Hatchie, the Confederate army retreated to Holly Springs.Cozzens, pp. 277-279, 285-290, 300. Price's force lost 35 percent of its strength, with most of the casualties in Maury's division (2,500 men out of 3,900, with another 600 desertions during the retreat). Both Price's and Van Dorn's districts were merged into the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, commanded by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton, who took over the Army of West Tennessee. Price was reassigned to the Trans-Mississippi Department in February 1863 but the Missouri regiments were not transferred with him as he had requested.Cozzens, pp. 305-307, 321-322.

It must be maintained within narrow limits because too little pressure could cause brain tissue to become ischemic (having inadequate blood flow), and too much could raise intracranial pressure (ICP). Definitions The cranium encloses a fixed- volume space that holds three components: blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and very soft tissue (the brain). While both the blood and CSF have poor compression capacity, the brain is easily compressible. Every increase of ICP can cause a change in tissue perfusion and an increase in stroke events. =From resistance= CPP can be defined as the pressure gradient causing cerebral blood flow (CBF) such that : CBF = CPP/CVR where: :CVR is cerebrovascular resistance =By intracranial pressure= An alternative definition of CPP is: : CPP=MAP-ICP where: :MAP is mean arterial pressure :ICP is intracranial pressure :JVP is jugular venous pressure This definition may be more appropriate if considering the circulatory system in the brain as a Starling resistor, where an external pressure (in this case, the intracranial pressure) causes decreased blood flow through the vessels. In this sense, more specifically, the cerebral perfusion pressure can be defined as either: : CPP = MAP - ICP (if ICP is higher than JVP) or : CPP = MAP - JVP (if JVP is higher than ICP). Physiologically, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) causes decreased blood perfusion of brain cells by mainly two mechanisms: *Increased ICP constitutes an increased interstitial hydrostatic pressure that, in turn, causes a decreased driving force for capillary filtration from intracerebral blood vessels. *Increased ICP compresses cerebral arteries, causing increased cerebrovascular resistance (CVR). FLOW Ranging from 20ml 100g-1 min-1 in white matter to 70ml 100g-1 min-1 in grey matter. Autoregulation Under normal circumstances a MAP between 60 and 160 mmHg and ICP about 10 mmHg (CPP of 50-150 mmHg) sufficient blood flow can be maintained with autoregulation. Although the classic 'autoregulation curve' suggests that CBF is fully stable between these blood pressure values (known also as the limits of autoregulation), in practice spontaneous fluctuations can occur. Outside of the limits of autoregulation, raising MAP raises CBF and raising ICP lowers it (this is one reason that increasing ICP in traumatic brain injury is potentially deadly). In trauma some recommend CPP not go below 70 mmHg. Recommendations in children is at least 60 mmHg. Within the autoregulatory range, as CPP falls there is, within seconds, vasodilatation of the cerebral resistance vessels, a fall in cerebrovascular resistance and a rise in cerebral-blood volume (CBV), and therefore CBF will return to baseline value within seconds (see as ref. Aaslid, Lindegaard, Sorteberg, and Nornes 1989: http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/1/45.pdf). These adaptations to rapid changes in blood pressure (in contrast with changes that occur over periods of hours or days) are known as dynamic cerebral autoregulation.

Bridwell hit the (apparent) single which led to the crucial Merkle's Boner running error of the season against the Chicago Cubs. The error ended up costing the Giants the pennant (the apparent winning run was nullified, the game was thus declared a tie, and the Cubs won the makeup of that game). Bridwell never played in a World Series. Midway through the 1911 season, he was traded by the Giants, who would go on to play in the 1911 World Series, to the Boston Rustlers. He played his final two years in the Federal League. In 1,252 career games, Bridwell batted .255 with 350 RBIs. He had 1,064 hits, with 95 doubles and 32 triples in 4,169 at bats. Bridwell had this to say about the reason why John McGraw was a great manager: \\"He knew how to handle men, some players he rode and others he didn't. He got the most out of each man.\\" Bridwell's pugnaciousness fit right in with McGraw's style of play. He once punched McGraw in the nose, earning a two-game suspension. However, in The Glory of their Times, Bridwell said he was suspended for two weeks. Bridwell was interviewed for Lawrence Ritter's 1966 book The Glory of their Times. He died at age 85 and had one daughter.

Some direct action groups, environmental movements, and professional organisations have identified themselves with the movement at the local, national, or international level.Fox Butterfield.

Major anti- nuclear groups include Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, Peace Action and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service. The initial objective of the movement was nuclear disarmament, though since the late 1960s opposition has included the use of nuclear power. Many anti-nuclear groups oppose both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The formation of green parties in the 1970s and 1980s was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics.John Barry and E. Gene Frankland, International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics, 2001, p. 24. Scientists and diplomats have debated nuclear weapons policy since before the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The public became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the Pacific. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing. Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s, and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns. In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, West Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America. Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970sJim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, pp. 95‚Äì96. and while opposition to nuclear power continues, increasing public support for nuclear power has re-emerged over the last decade in light of growing awareness of global warming and renewed interest in all types of clean energy (see the Pro-nuclear movement). A protest against nuclear power occurred in July 1977 in Bilbao, Spain, with up to 200,000 people in attendance. Following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, an anti-nuclear protest was held in New York City, involving 200,000 people. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant west of Hamburg; some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. The largest protest was held on 12 June 1982, when one million people demonstrated in New York City against nuclear weapons. A 1983 nuclear weapons protest in West Berlin had about 600,000 participants. In May 1986, following the Chernobyl disaster, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program. In the US, public opposition preceded the shutdown of the Shoreham, Yankee Rowe, Millstone 1, Rancho Seco, Maine Yankee, and many other nuclear power plants. For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following public relations activities by the nuclear industry,Jonathan Leake. \\"The Nuclear Charm Offensive\\" New Statesman, 23 May 2005.Union of Concerned Scientists.

The 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed renaissance and revived nuclear opposition worldwide, putting governments on the defensive. As of 2016, countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Norway have no nuclear power stations and remain opposed to nuclear power. Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland are phasing-out nuclear power. Sweden formerly had a nuclear phase-out policy, aiming to end nuclear power generation in Sweden by 2010. On 5 February 2009, the Government of Sweden announced an agreement allowing for the replacement of existing reactors, effectively ending the phase-out policy.Erika Simpson and Ian Fairlie, Dealing with nuclear waste is so difficult that phasing out nuclear power would be the best option, Lfpress, 26 February 2016.

Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear Movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age, Twayne Publishers, pp. 191‚Äì192. The public became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the Pacific. In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing.Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 54-55. Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s, and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.Wolfgang Rudig (1990).

The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America. Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.  Fossil fuels industry  Fossil oil and industry starting from 50's was engaging into campaigns against nuclear industry which it perceived it as a threat to their commercial interests. Organizations such as American Petroleum Institute, the Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association and Marcellus Shale Coalition were engaged in anti-nuclear lobbying in late 2010's and from 2019 large fossil fuel suppliers started advertising campaigns portraying fossil gas as \\"perfect partner for renewables\\" (actual wording from Shell and Statoil advertisements). Fossil fuel companies such as Atlantic Richfield were also donors to environmental organizations with clear anti-nuclear stance such as Friends of the Earth. Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council are receiving grants from other fossil fuel companies. As of 2011 Greenpeace strategy Battle of Grids proposed gradual replacement of nuclear power by fossil gas plants which would provide \\"flexible backup for wind and solar power\\". =Anti-nuclear perspectives= Concerns about nuclear weapons The 18,000 km2 expanse of the Semipalatinsk Test Site (indicated in red), which covers an area the size of Wales. The Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989 with little regard for their effect on the local people or environment. The full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by Soviet authorities and has only come to light since the test site closed in 1991. From an anti-nuclear point of view, there is a threat to modern civilization from global nuclear war by accidental or deliberate nuclear strike. Some climate scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions from climatic effects alone and disabled future generation . Soot thrown up into the atmosphere could blanket the earth, causing food chain disruption in what is termed a nuclear winter.Philip Yam. Nuclear Exchange, Scientific American, June 2010, p. 24.Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon. Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, Scientific American, January 2010, p. 74-81. Many anti-nuclear weapons groups cite the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, in which it found that 'the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict'. Ridding the world of nuclear weapons has been a cause for pacifists for decades. But more recently mainstream politicians and retired military leaders have advocated nuclear disarmament. In January 2007 an article in The Wall Street Journal, authored by Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and Sam Nunn. These men were veterans of the cold-war who believed in using nuclear weapons for deterrence. But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that instead of making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme concern. Since the 1970s, some countries have built their own second-strike capability of massive deterrence in the event of a military attack with weapons of mass destruction. Two examples of this second-strike capability are the Samson Option strategy of Israel, and the Dead Hand system of Russia. During the era of nuclear weapons testing many local communities were affected, and some are still affected by uranium mining, and radioactive waste disposal.Frida Berrigan. The New Anti- Nuclear Movement Foreign Policy in Focus, 16 April 2010. Concerns about nuclear power Following the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster, authorities shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants. As of 2013, the Fukushima site remains highly radioactive, with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some land will be unfarmable for centuries. The difficult cleanup job will take 40 or more years, and cost tens of billions of dollars. The abandoned city of Prypiat, Ukraine, following the April 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is in the background. President Jimmy Carter leaving the Three Mile Island accident for Middletown, Pennsylvania, 1 April 1979 There are large variations in peoples‚Äô understanding of the issues surrounding nuclear power, including the technology itself, its deployment, climate change, and energy security. There is a wide spectrum of views and concerns over nuclear powerSustainable Development Commission. Public engagement and nuclear power and it remains a controversial area of public policy.Sustainable Development Commission. Is Nuclear the Answer? p. 12. When compared to other energy sources, nuclear power has one of the lowest death rates per unit of energy produced ‚Äî 0.07 per TWh, as compared to over 32 per TWh in case of brown coal. Many studies have shown that the public \\"perceives nuclear power as a very risky technology\\" and, around the world, nuclear energy has declined in popularity since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity.Helen Caldicott (2006). Nuclear Power is Not the Answer to Global Warming or Anything Else, Melbourne University Press, , p. xvii Opponents of nuclear power have raised a number of related concerns:Brian Martin. Opposing nuclear power: past and present, Social Alternatives, Vol. 26, No. 2, Second Quarter 2007, pp. 43‚Äì47. *Nuclear accidents: a safety concern that the core of a nuclear power plant could overheat and melt down, releasing radioactivity. *Radioactive waste disposal: a concern that nuclear power results in large amounts of radioactive waste, some of which remains dangerous for very long periods. *Nuclear proliferation: a concern that some types of nuclear reactor designs use and/or produce fissile material which could be used in nuclear weapons. *High cost: a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive to build, and that clean up from nuclear accidents are highly expensive and can take decades. *Attacks on nuclear plants: a concern that nuclear facilities could be targeted by terrorists or criminals. *Curtailed civil liberties: a concern that the risk of nuclear accidents, proliferation and terrorism may be used to justify restraints on citizen rights. Of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive waste have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide. Anti-nuclear campaigners point to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear emergency as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe. Costs resulting from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster are likely to exceed 12 trillion yen ($100 billion) and the clean up effort to decontaminate affected areas and decommission the plant is estimated to take 30 to 40 years. Excluding accidents, the standard amount of high-level radioactive waste is however tiny (UK has produced just 2150 m3 during its 60 years nuclear program), it can be effectively recycled and stored safely. In his book Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Jim Falk explores connections between technological concerns and political concerns. Falk suggests that concerns of citizen groups or individuals who oppose nuclear power have often focused initially on the \\"range of physical hazards which accompany the technology\\" and leads to a \\"concern over the political relations of the nuclear industry\\" A more neutral observer might observe that this is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. Baruch Fischhoff, a social science professor said that many people really do not trust the nuclear industry.Matthew L. Wald. Edging Back to Nuclear Power The New York Times, 21 April 2010. Wade Allison, a physics professor actually says \\"radiation is safe & all nations should embrace nuclear technology\\" M.V. Ramana says that \\"distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy is widespread\\", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that \\"only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry\\". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by nuclear safety violations, or through ineffectiveness or corruption of the nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain. Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has \\"tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power\\", including the publication of numerous \\"fact sheets\\" that discuss issues of public concern. M.V. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful. Nuclear proponents have tried to regain public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. These designs include those that incorporate passive safety and Small Modular Reactors. While these reactor designs \\"are intended to inspire trust, they may have an unintended effect: creating distrust of older reactors that lack the touted safety features\\". Since 2000 the nuclear power was promoted as potential solution to the greenhouse effect and climate change as nuclear power emits no or negligible amounts of carbon dioxide during operations. Anti-nuclear groups highlighted the fact that other stages of the nuclear fuel chain ‚Äì mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management ‚Äì use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide.Mark Diesendorf. Is nuclear energy a possible solution to global warming? Kurt Kleiner. Nuclear energy: assessing the emissions Nature Reports, Vol. 2, October 2008, pp. 130‚Äì131.Mark Diesendorf (2007). Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy, University of New South Wales Press, p. 252. As this is the case with any energy sources, including renewable energy, IPCC analyzed total life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions, which account for all emissions during manufacturing, installation, operations and decommissioning. With 12 gCO2eq/kWh nuclear power still remains one of the lowest emitting energy sources available. In 2011, a French court fined √âlectricit√© de France (EDF) ‚Ç¨1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace's computer systems. Greenpeace was awarded ‚Ç¨500,000 in damages. There is a wide range of published energy-related studies which conclude that energy efficiency programs and renewable power technologies are a better energy option than nuclear power plants. This diverse range of studies come from many different sources, across the political spectrum, and from various academic disciplines, which suggests that there is a consensus among many independent, non-partisan energy experts that nuclear power plants are a poor way to produce electrical power.Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power, Non-Nuclear Futures, Reaction Time. Other technologies The international nuclear fusion project International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is constructing the world's largest and most advanced experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor in the south of France. A collaboration between the European Union (EU), India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States, the project aims to make a transition from experimental studies of plasma physics to electricity-producing fusion power plants. In 2005, Greenpeace International issued a press statement criticizing government funding of the ITER, believing the money should have been diverted to renewable energy sources and claiming that fusion energy would result in nuclear waste and nuclear weapons proliferation issues. A French association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, Sortir du nucl√©aire (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), claimed that ITER was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium hydrogen isotopes used in the fusion process. According to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear fusion power \\"remains a distant dream\\". The World Nuclear Association have said that fusion \\"presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges\\". Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns. Several milestones of the project has already been finished, but the finishing date for First Plasma has been discussed and postponed many times with various conclusions. In late 2016, the ITER council agreed on an updated project schedule, with a planned First Plasma opening by 2025, nine years after the originally anticipated opening. Some anti-nuclear groups advocate reduced reliance on reactor-produced medical radioisotopes, through the use of alternative radioisotope production and alternative clinical technologies. Cyclotrons are being increasingly used to produce medical radioisotopes to the point where nuclear reactors are no longer needed to make the most common medical isotopes. =Nuclear-free alternatives= Three renewable energy sources: solar energy, wind power, and hydroelectricity The 150 MW Andasol Solar Power Station is a commercial parabolic trough solar thermal power plant, located in Spain. The Andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isn't shining. Photovoltaic SUDI shade is an autonomous and mobile station in France that provides energy for electric vehicles using solar energy. Anti-nuclear groups say that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting energy conservation and energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption while providing the same level of energy \\"services\\".Greenpeace International and European Renewable Energy Council (January 2007).

Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight, wind, tides, plant growth, and geothermal heat, as the International Energy Agency explains:IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002).

Anti-nuclear groups also favour the use of renewable energy, such as hydro, wind power, solar power, geothermal energy and biofuel.Greenpeace International and European Renewable Energy Council (January 2007).

Yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage, 11.4% in the EU, and it is widely used in Asia, and the United States. In 2014, worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 177 gigawatts (GW), sufficient to supply 1 percent of global electricity demands. As of 2020 wind power expansion slowed down due to protests of residents and environmentalists. Solar thermal energy stations operate in the United States and Spain, and as of 2016, the largest of these is the 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in California.\\"World's Largest Solar Thermal Power Project at Ivanpah Achieves Commercial Operation\\" , NRG press release, 13 February 2014. The world's largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California, with a rated capacity of 750 MW. Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel. Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the United States. As of 2020 expansion of biomass as fuel, which was previously praised by environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, has been criticized for environmental damage. Greenpeace advocates a reduction of fossil fuels by 50% by 2050 as well as phasing out nuclear power, contending that innovative technologies can increase energy efficiency, and suggests that by 2050 most electricity will come from renewable sources. The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly 50% of global electricity supplies will need to come from renewable energy sources in order to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and minimise climate change impacts.International Energy Agency. IEA urges governments to adopt effective policies based on key design principles to accelerate the exploitation of the large potential for renewable energy 29 September 2008. Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford professor, says producing all new energy with wind power, solar power, and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be \\"primarily social and political, not technological or economic\\". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs. Many have since referred to Jacobson's work to justify advocating for all 100% renewables, however, in February, 2017, a group of twenty-one scientists published a critique of Jacobson's work and found that his analysis involves \\"errors, inappropriate methods and implausible assumptions\\" and failed to provide \\"credible evidence for rejecting the conclusions of previous analyses that point to the benefits of considering a broad portfolio of energy system options.\\" Anti-nuclear organizations Members of Nevada Desert Experience hold a prayer vigil during the Easter period of 1982 at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site. The anti-nuclear movement is a social movement which operates at the local, national, and international level. Various types of groups have identified themselves with the movement: * direct action groups, such as the Clamshell Alliance and Shad Alliance * environmental groups, such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace * consumer protection groups, such as Ralph Nader's Critical Mass * professional organisations, such as International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War * political parties such as European Free Alliance Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public protests and acts of civil disobedience which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. Other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government authorities, influencing public policy through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections. Anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licensing proceedings.Herbert P. Kitschelt. Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 67. Anti- nuclear power organisations have emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme. Protest movements against nuclear power first emerged in the United States, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. Fuelled by the Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster, the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years \\"made nuclear energy untenable in many countries\\".Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 1. In the 1970s and 1980s, the formation of green parties was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics (e.g., in Germany and Sweden). Some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on nuclear power and energy issues.Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power, Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 279. In 1992, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that \\"his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups\\".Matthew L.

In 1971, the town of Wyhl, in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue. In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant. The Wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites. In 1972, the nuclear disarmament movement maintained a presence in the Pacific, largely in response to French nuclear testing there. New Zealand activists sailed boats into the test zone, interrupting the testing program.Paul Lewis. David McTaggart, a Builder of Greenpeace, Dies at 69 The New York Times, 24 March 2001.Lawrence S. Wittner. Nuclear Disarmament Activism in Asia and the Pacific, 1971‚Äì1996 The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol. 25‚Äì5‚Äì09, 22 June 2009. In Australia, thousands of people joined protest marches in Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney. Scientists issued statements demanding an end to the nuclear tests. In Fiji, anti-nuclear activists formed an Against Testing on Mururoa organization. In the Basque Country (Spain and France), a strong anti- nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately led to the abandonment of most of the planned nuclear power projects.Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power, Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 371. On 14 July 1977, in Bilbao, between 150,000 and 200,000 people protested against the Lemoniz Nuclear Power Plant. This has been called the \\"biggest ever anti-nuclear demonstration\\".Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 138. In France, there were mass protests in the early 1970s, organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in France. Between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations.Herbert P. Kitschelt. Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 71.

In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. Following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in Bonn. In the Philippines, there were many protests in the late 1970s and 1980s against the proposed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, which was built but never operated. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration protested against the construction of the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant west of Hamburg.

The march took nine months to traverse , advancing approximately fifteen miles per day.Hundreds of Marchers Hit Washington in Finale of Nationwide Peace March Gainesville Sun, 16 November 1986. The anti-nuclear organisation \\"Nevada Semipalatinsk\\" was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear groups in the former Soviet Union. It attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the nuclear test site in north-east Kazakhstan, in 1991.World: Asia-Pacific: Kazakh anti-nuclear movement celebrates tenth anniversary BBC News, 28 February 1999.Matthew Chance. Inside the nuclear underworld: Deformity and fear CNN.com, 31 August 2007.Protests Stop Devastating Nuclear Tests: The Nevada-Semipalatinsk Anti-Nuclear Movement in Kazakhstan The World Uranium Hearing was held in Salzburg, Austria in September 1992. Anti-nuclear speakers from all continents, including indigenous speakers and scientists, testified to the health and environmental problems of uranium mining and processing, nuclear power, nuclear weapons, nuclear tests, and radioactive waste disposal. People who spoke at the 1992 Hearing included: Thomas Banyacya, Katsumi Furitsu, Manuel Pino and Floyd Red Crow Westerman. =Protests in the United States= Anti-nuclear protest in 1979 following the Three Mile Island accident There were many anti-nuclear protests in the United States which captured national public attention during the 1970s and 1980s. These included the well-known Clamshell Alliance protests at Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant and the Abalone Alliance protests at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, where thousands of protesters were arrested. Other large protests followed the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. A large anti-nuclear demonstration was held in May 1979 in Washington, D.C., when 65,000 people including the Governor of California, attended a march and rally against nuclear power. In New York City on 23 September 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a protest against nuclear power. Anti-nuclear power protests preceded the shutdown of the Shoreham, Yankee Rowe, Millstone I, Rancho Seco, Maine Yankee, and about a dozen other nuclear power plants.Williams, Estha.

Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, is scheduled to close in 2014, following many protests. Protesters in New York State are seeking to close Indian Point Energy Center, in Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City. =Recent developments= For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following public relations activities by the nuclear industry, advances in nuclear reactor designs, and concerns about climate change, nuclear power issues came back into energy policy discussions in some countries. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed come back. ;2004‚Äì2006 In January 2004, up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Paris against a new generation of nuclear reactors, the European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPWR).Thousands march in Paris anti-nuclear protest ABC News, 18 January 2004. On 1 May 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for several decades. In Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging Trident weapons system with a newer model. The largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of the public opposed the move.Lawrence S. Wittner. A rebirth of the anti-nuclear weapons movement?

In June 2007, 4,000 local residents, students and anti-nuclear activists took to the streets in the city of Kudzus in Indonesia's Central Java, calling on the Government to abandon plans to build a nuclear power plant there. In February 2008, a group of concerned scientists and engineers called for the closure of the Kazantzakis-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament took place in Oslo in February 2008, and was organized by The Government of Norway, the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Hoover Institute. The Conference was entitled Achieving the Vision of a World Free of Nuclear Weapons and had the purpose of building consensus between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states in relation to the Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty. During a weekend in October 2008, some 15,000 people disrupted the transport of radioactive nuclear waste from France to a dump in Germany. This was one of the largest such protests in many years and, according to Der Spiel, it signals a revival of the anti-nuclear movement in Germany.The Renaissance of the Anti-Nuclear Movement Spiel Online, 11/10/2008.Anti-Nuclear Protest Reawakens: Nuclear Waste Reaches German Storage Site Amid Fierce Protests Spiel Online, 11/11/2008.Simon Sturdiness.

German nuclear programme threatened by old mine housing waste The Times, 22 January 2010. ;2010 KETTENreAKTION! in Uetersen, Germany On 21 April 2010, a dozen environmental organizations called on the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to investigate possible limitations in the AP1000 reactor design. These groups appealed to three federal agencies to suspend the licensing process because they believed containment in the new design is weaker than existing reactors. On 24 April 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (KETTENreAKTION!) between the nuclear plants at Kr√ºmmel and Brunsb√ºttel. In this way they were demonstrating against the plans of the German government to extend the life of nuclear power reactors. In May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched for about two kilometers from downtown New York to the United Nations headquarters, calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons.A-bomb survivors join 25,000-strong anti-nuclear march through New York Mainichi Daily News, 4 May 2010.

Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. On 12 March 2011, 60,000 Germans formed a 45-km human chain from Stuttgart to the Neckarwestheim power plant. On 14 March 110,000 people protested in 450 other German towns, with opinion polls indicating 80% of Germans opposed the government's extension of nuclear power. On 15 March 2011, Angela Merkel said that seven nuclear power plants which went online before 1980 would be closed and the time would be used to study speedier renewable energy commercialization. In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate halt to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to plans to extend the lifespan of three existing nuclear plants. In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the largest anti- nuclear demonstration the country has seen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011. About 7,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in Bremen. About 3,000 people protested outside RWE's headquarters in Essen. Citing the Fukushima nuclear disaster, environmental activists at a U.N. meeting in April 2011 \\"urged bolder steps to tap renewable energy so the world doesn't have to choose between the dangers of nuclear power and the ravages of climate change\\". In mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power. In India, environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project six-reactor complex, 420 km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated following Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster and during two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured. In May 2011, some 20,000 people turned out for Switzerland's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration in 25 years. Demonstrators marched peacefully near the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant, the oldest in Switzerland, which started operating 40 years ago. Days after the anti-nuclear rally, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power reactors. The country's five existing reactors would be allowed to continue operating, but \\"would not be replaced at the end of their life span\\". In May 2011, 5,000 people joined a carnival-like anti- nuclear protest in Taipei City. This was part of a nationwide \\"No Nuke Action\\" protest, urging the government to stop construction of a Fourth Nuclear Plant and pursue a more sustainable energy policy. On World Environment Day in June 2011, environmental groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and legislators, gathered in Taipei and protested against the nation's three operating nuclear power plants and the construction of a fourth plant. Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters marched in Japan. Company workers, students, and parents with children rallied across Japan, \\"venting their anger at the government's handling of the crisis, carrying flags bearing the words 'No Nukes!' and 'No More Fukushima'.\\" In August 2011, about 2,500 people including farmers and fishermen marched in Tokyo. They are suffering heavy losses following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and called for prompt compensation from plant operator TEPCO and the government. In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching to the beat of drums, \\"took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant\\". Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy. Tens of thousands of people marched in central Tokyo in September 2011, chanting \\"Sayonara nuclear power\\" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Author Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto were among the event's supporters. Since the March 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster, \\"populations around proposed Indian NPP sites have launched protests that are now finding resonance around the country, raising questions about atomic energy as a clean and safe alternative to fossil fuels\\". Assurances by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that all safety measures will be implemented, have not been heeded, and there have thus been mass protests against the French-backed 9900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Maharashtra and the 2000 MW Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu. The state government of West Bengal state has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 MW facility where six Russian reactors were to be built. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government's civil nuclear program at the apex Supreme Court. The PIL specifically asks for the \\"staying of all proposed nuclear power plants till satisfactory safety measures and cost-benefit analyses are completed by independent agencies\\". Michael Banach, the current Vatican representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference in Vienna in September 2011 that the Japanese nuclear disaster created new concerns about the safety of nuclear plants globally. Auxiliary bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said this serious nuclear power incident should be a lesson for Japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects. He called on the worldwide Christian solidarity to provide wide support for this anti-nuclear campaign. Statements from bishops‚Äô conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power. Nobel laureate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe has said Japan should decide quickly to abandon its nuclear reactors. In the UK, in October 2011, more than 200 protesters blockaded the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station site. Members of the Stop New Nuclear alliance barred access to the site in protest at EDF Energy's plans to build two new reactors on the site. ;2012 Protest at Neckarwestheim, Germany, 11 March 2012 In January 2012, 22 South Korean women's groups appealed for a nuclear free future, saying they believe nuclear weapons and power reactors \\"threaten our lives, the lives of our families and all living creatures\\". The women said they feel an enormous sense of crisis after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, which demonstrated the destructive power of radiation in the disruption of human lives, environmental pollution, and food contamination. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Yokohama, Japan, on 14‚Äì15 January 2012, to show their support for a nuclear power-free world. The demonstration showed that organized opposition to nuclear power has gained momentum following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The most immediate demand of the demonstrators was for the protection of rights, including basic human rights such as health care, for those affected by the Fukushima accident. In January 2012, three hundred anti-nuclear protestors marched against plans to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in the UK. The march was organised by Pobl Atal Wylfa B, Greenpeace and Cymdeithas yr Iaith, which are supporting a farmer who is in dispute with Horizon. On the anniversary of the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, protesters across Japan called for the abolishment of nuclear power and nuclear reactors. In Koriyama, Fukushima, 16,000 people called for the end of nuclear power. In Shizuoka Prefecture, 1,100 people appealed for the scrapping of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant. In Tsuruga, Fukui, 1,200 people marched in the streets of the city of Tsuruga, the home of the Monju fast-breeder reactor prototype and other nuclear reactors. In Nagasaki and Hiroshima, anti-nuclear protesters and atomic-bomb survivors marched together and demanded that Japan should end its nuclear dependency.The Mainichi Shimbun (12 March 2012) Antinuclear protests held across Japan on anniversary of disaster Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann expects anti-nuclear petition drives to start in at least six European Union countries in 2012 in an effort to have the EU abandon nuclear power. Under the EU's Lisbon Treaty, petitions that attract at least one million signatures can seek legislative proposals from the European Commission, which would pave the way for anti-nuclear activists to garner support. In March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital following the massive tsunami that hit Japan one year ago. The protesters rallied in Taipei to renew calls for a nuclear-free island. They \\"want the government to scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant ‚Äì the fourth in densely populated Taiwan\\". Scores of aboriginal protesters \\"demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on their Orchid Island\\". In March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney. In March 2012, South Korean environmental groups held a rally in Seoul to oppose nuclear power. Over 5,000 people attended, and the turnout was one of the largest in recent memory for an anti-nuclear rally. The demonstration demanded that President Lee Myung Bak abandon his policy of promoting nuclear power. In March 2012, police said they had arrested nearly 200 anti-nuclear activists who were protesting the restart of work at the long-stalled Indian Kudankulam nuclear power plant. In June 2012, tens of thousands of Japanese protesters participated in anti-nuclear power rallies in Tokyo and Osaka, over the government's decision to restart the first idled reactors since the Fukushima disaster, at Oi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui Prefecture. ;2013 Anti-nuclear protesters in Taipei Thousands of protesters marched in Tokyo on 11 March 2013 calling on the government to reject nuclear power. In March 2013, 68,000 Taiwanese protested across major cities against nuclear power and the island's fourth nuclear plant, which is under construction. Taiwan's three existing nuclear plants are near the ocean, and prone to geological fractures, under the island. In April 2013, thousands of Scottish campaigners, MSPs, and union leaders, rallied against nuclear weapons. The Scrap Trident Coalition wants to see an end to nuclear weapons, and says saved monies should be used for health, education and welfare initiatives. There was also a blockade of the Faslane Naval Base, where Trident missiles are stored. ;2014 Anti-nuclear protesters shot with water cannons in Taiwan In March 2014, around 130,000 Taiwanese marched for an anti-nuclear protest around Taiwan. They demanded that the government remove nuclear power plants in Taiwan. The march came ahead of the 3rd anniversary of Fukushima disaster. Around 50,000 people marched in Taipei while another three separate events were held around other Taiwanese cities attended by around 30,000 people. Among the participants are the organizations from Green Citizen Action's Alliance, Homemakers United Foundation, Taiwan Association for Human Rights and Taiwan Environmental Protection Union. Facing on-going opposition and a host of delays, construction of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant was halted in April 2014. =Casualties= Anti-nuclear demonstrations near Gorleben, Lower Saxony, Germany, 8 May 1996 Casualties during anti-nuclear protests include: *On 9 December 1982, Norman Mayer, an American anti‚Äìnuclear weapons activist, was shot and killed by the United States Park Police after threatening to blow up the Washington Monument, Washington, D.C., unless a national dialogue on the threat of nuclear weapons was seriously undertaken. *On 10 July 1985, the flagship of Greenpeace, Rainbow Warrior, was sunk by French agents in New Zealand waters, and a Greenpeace photographer was killed. The ship was involved in protests against nuclear weapons testing at Mururoa Atoll.

Impact =Impact on popular culture= Montage of film stills from the International Uranium Film Festival Beginning in the 1950s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as Fail-Safe and feature films such as Godzilla (1954),Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), The China Syndrome (1979), Silkwood (1983), and The Rainbow Warrior (1992). Dr. Strangelove explored \\"what might happen within the Pentagon ... if some maniac Air Force general should suddenly order a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union\\". One reviewer called the movie \\"one of the cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been on the screen\\".Bosley Crowther. Movie Review: Dr. Strangelove (1964) The New York Times, 31 January 1964. The China Syndrome has been described as a \\"gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power\\" which had an extra impact when the real-life accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant occurred several weeks after the film opened. Jane Fonda plays a TV reporter who witnesses a near-meltdown (the \\"China syndrome\\" of the title) at a local nuclear plant, which was averted by a quick-thinking engineer, played by Jack Lemmon. The plot suggests that corporate greed and cost-cutting \\"have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction\\".The China Syndrome (1979) The New York Times. Silkwood was inspired by the true-life story of Karen Silkwood, who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant where she worked. Dark Circle is a 1982 American documentary film that focuses on the connections between the nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industries, with a strong emphasis on the individual human and protracted U.S. environmental costs involved. A clear point made by the film is that while only two bombs were dropped on Japan, many hundreds were exploded in the United States. The film won the Grand Prize for documentary at the Sundance Film Festival and received a national Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding individual achievement in news and documentary.\\"Dark Circle, DVD release date 27 March 2007, Directors: Judy Irving, Chris Beaver, Ruth Landy. . For the opening scenes and about half of its length, the film focuses on the Rocky Flats Plant and its plutonium contamination of the area's environment. , (literally \\"Humming of Bees and Rotation of the Earth\\") is a Japanese documentary directed by Hitomi Kamanaka and released in 2010. It is the third in Kamanaka's trilogy of films on the problems of nuclear power and radiation, preceded by Hibakusha at the End of the World (also known as Radiation: A Slow Death) and Rokkasho Rhapsody. Nuclear Tipping Point is a 2010 documentary film produced by the Nuclear Threat Initiative. It features interviews with four American government officials who were in office during the Cold War period, but are now advocating for the elimination of nuclear weapons. They are: Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry. Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE) was a musical group founded in 1979 by Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Bonnie Raitt, and John Hall, following the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. The group organized a series of five No Nukes concerts held at Madison Square Garden in New York City in September 1979. On 23 September 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large anti-nuclear rally staged by MUSE on the then- empty north end of the Battery Park City landfill in New York. The album No Nukes, and a film, also titled No Nukes, were both released in 1980 to document the performances. In 2007, Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash, and Jackson Browne, as part of the No Nukes group, recorded a music video of the Buffalo Springfield song \\"For What It's Worth\\".Musicians Act to Stop New Atomic Reactors Filmmakers Taylor Dunne and Eric Stewart are working on a documentary called \\"Off country\\" that looks at the devastating effects of atomic bomb testing on the communities around the White Sands missile range in New Mexico, the Nevada Test Site and the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado. They were interviewed by Screen Comment's Sam Weisberg in 2017. =Impact on policy= U.S. and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945‚Äì2005 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is a nontechnical online magazine that has been published continuously since 1945, when it was founded by former Manhattan Project physicists after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Bulletins primary aim is to inform the public about nuclear policy debates while advocating for the international control of nuclear weapons. One of the driving forces behind the creation of the Bulletin was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy at the dawn of the atomic age. In 1945 the public interest in atomic warfare and weaponry inspired contributors to the Bulletin to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers and destruction that atomic war could bring about. In the 1950s, the Bulletin was involved in the formation of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, annual conferences of scientists concerned about nuclear proliferation. Historian Lawrence S. Wittner has argued that anti-nuclear sentiment and activism led directly to government policy shifts about nuclear weapons. Public opinion influenced policymakers by limiting their options and also by forcing them to follow certain policies over others. Wittner credits public pressure and anti-nuclear activism with \\"Truman‚Äôs decision to explore the Baruch Plan, Eisenhower‚Äôs efforts towards a nuclear test ban and the 1958 testing moratorium, and Kennedy‚Äôs signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty\\".Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Confronting the Bomb: A Short History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement In terms of nuclear power, Forbes magazine, in the September 1975 issue, reported that \\"the anti-nuclear coalition has been remarkably successful ... [and] has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power.\\" California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal,Jim Doyle. Nuclear power industry sees opening for revival San Francisco Chronicle, 9 March 2009. and some other U.S. states have a moratorium on construction of nuclear power plants.Minnesota House says no to new nuclear power plants StarTribune.com, 30 April 2009. Between 1975 and 1980, a total of 63 nuclear units were canceled in the United States. Anti- nuclear activities were among the reasons, but the primary motivations were the overestimation of future demand for electricity and steadily increasing capital costs, which made the economics of new plants unfavorable. The proliferation of nuclear weapons became a presidential priority issue for the Carter Administration in the late 1970s. To deal with proliferation problems, President Carter promoted stronger international control over nuclear technology, including nuclear reactor technology. Although a strong supporter of nuclear power generally, Carter turned against the breeder reactor because the plutonium it produced could be diverted into nuclear weapons.William A. Gamson and Andre Modigliani. Media Coverage and Public Opinion on Nuclear Power, American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 95, No. 1, July 1989, p. 15. For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries. In recent years, intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear power issues back to the forefront of policy discussion in the nuclear renaissance countries. But some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy, through nuclear power phase-out legislation.Research and Markets: International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power Reuters, 6 May 2009. Under the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987, all territorial sea and land of New Zealand is declared a nuclear free zone. Nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships are prohibited from entering the country's territorial waters. Dumping of foreign radioactive waste and development of nuclear weapons in the country is outlawed. Despite common misconception, this act does not make nuclear power plants illegal, nor does it make radioactive medical treatments produced in overseas reactors illegal. A 2008 survey shows that 19% of New Zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy source, while 77% prefer wind power as the best energy source. On 26 February 1990, FW de Klerk issued orders to terminate the country's nuclear weapons programme, which until then had been a state secret.http://people.reed.edu/~ahm/Courses/Stan- PS-314-2009-Q1_PNP/Syllabus/EReadings/Albright1994South.pdf South Africa becomes the first country in the world to voluntary give-up its nuclear weapons programme. UN vote on adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons on 7 July 2017 Ireland, in 1999, had no plans to change its non-nuclear stance and pursue nuclear power in the future. In the United States, the Navajo Nation forbids uranium mining and processing in its land. In the United States, a 2007 University of Maryland survey showed that 73 percent of the public surveyed favours the elimination of all nuclear weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 59 percent support reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to 400 weapons each. Given the unpopularity of nuclear weapons, U.S. politicians have been wary of supporting new nuclear programs. Republican-dominated congresses \\"have defeated the Bush administration's plan to build so-called 'bunker-busters' and 'mini-nukes'.\\" The Megatons to Megawatts Program converts weapons-grade material from nuclear warheads into fuel for nuclear power plants. Bulletin of atomic scientists Thirty-one countries operate nuclear power plants.Mycle Schneider, Steve Thomas, Antony Froggatt, Doug Koplow (August 2009). The World Nuclear Industry Status Report, German Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety, p. 6. Nine nations possess nuclear weapons:Ralph Summy.

U.S. President Barack Obama with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev after signing the New START treaty in Prague, 2010 During Barack Obama's successful U.S. presidential election campaign, he advocated the abolition of nuclear weapons. Since his election he has reiterated this goal in several major policy addresses. In 2010, the Obama administration negotiated a new weapons accord with Russia for a reduction of the maximum number of deployed nuclear weapons on each side from 2,200 to between 1,500 and 1,675‚Äîa reduction of some 30 percent. In addition, President Obama has committed $15 billion over the next five years to improving the safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile.Jeremy Bernstein. Nukes for Sale The New York Review of Books, 14 April 2010. Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the Italian government put a one-year moratorium on plans to revive nuclear power. On 11‚Äì12 June 2011, Italian voters passed a referendum to cancel plans for new reactors. Over 94% of the electorate voted in favor of the construction ban, with 55% of the eligible voters participating, making the vote binding. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on 30 May 2011, that Germany's 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents and anti-nuclear protests within Germany. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so. As of 2011, countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Norway remain opposed to nuclear power. Germany and Switzerland are phasing-out nuclear power. =Public opinion surveys on nuclear issues= In 2005, the International Atomic Energy Agency presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues report. Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believed that the risk of terrorist acts involving radioactive materials at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally supported the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people did not favor the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents felt that all nuclear power plants should be closed down. Stressing the climate change benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.International Atomic Energy Agency (2005). Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries pp. 6‚Äì7. There was little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicated. The global research agency GlobeScan, commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believed that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs. Eurobarometer 2008 poll indicated 44% supporting and 45% opposing nuclear energy in the European Union. Majority (over 62%) also appreciated nuclear power as means to prevent climate change. Both Eurobarometer and subsequent OECD poll (2010) indicated a \\"clear correlation between knowledge and support\\", so respondents who were more aware of the greenhouse gas emissions from energy sector were more likely to support low-emission nuclear power. A 2012 meta-analysis also confirmed positive correlation between support for nuclear power and understanding of nuclear power operations, with a significant effect where people living closer to nuclear power plant showed higher levels of support in general. In the USA support and opposition to nuclear power plants is split almost equally. Criticism Stewart Brand at a 2010 debate, \\"Does the world need nuclear energy?\\" Attempts to reach political agreement on effective policies for climate change continue, and pro-nuclear environmentalists seek to reverse the traditionally anti-nuclear attitudes of environmentalists. Filmmaker Rob Stone's Pandora's Promise (2013) is a good example of this trend. Some environmentalists criticise the anti-nuclear movement for under-stating the environmental costs of fossil fuels and non- nuclear alternatives, and overstating the environmental costs of nuclear energy. Of the numerous nuclear experts who have offered their expertise in addressing controversies, Bernard Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, is likely the most frequently cited. In his extensive writings he examines the safety issues in detail. He is best known for comparing nuclear safety to the relative safety of a wide range of other phenomena. Anti-nuclear activists are accused of encouraging radiophobic emotions among the public. The War Against the Atom (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could be held responsible for about 100 deaths per year.Samuel MacCracken, The War Against the Atom, 1982, Basic Books, pp. 60‚Äì61 The Nuclear Energy InstituteNuclear Energy Institute website (NEI) is the main lobby group for companies doing nuclear work in the United States, while most countries that employ nuclear energy have a national industry group. The World Nuclear Association is the only global trade body. In seeking to counteract the arguments of nuclear opponents, it points to independent studies that quantify the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and compares them to the costs and benefits of alternatives. NEI sponsors studies of its own, but it also references studies performed for the World Health Organization,Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health: Budapest, Hungary, 23‚Äì25 June 2004 for the International Energy Agency,Executive Summary and by university researchers.Ari Rabl and Mona. Dreicer, Health and Environmental Impacts of Energy Systems. International Journal of Global Energy Issues, vol.18(2/3/4), 113‚Äì150 (2002) Critics of the anti-nuclear movement point to independent studies that show that the capital resources required for renewable energy sources are higher than those required for nuclear power. Some people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, criticize the movement on the basis of the claim that nuclear power is necessary for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These individuals include James Lovelock, originator of the Gaia hypothesis, Patrick Moore, an early member of Greenpeace and former director of Greenpeace International, George Monbiot and Stewart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog. Lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products. In a January 2008 interview, Moore said that \\"It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot.\\" Stewart Brand has apologized for his past anti-nuclear stance in 2010 book Whole Earth Discipline explaining that \\"Greens caused gigatons of carbon dioxide to enter the atmosphere from the coal and gas burning that went ahead instead of nuclear\\". Some anti-nuclear organisations have acknowledged that their positions are subject to review.Some rethinking nuke opposition USA Today In April 2007, Dan Becker, Director of Global Warming for the Sierra Club, declared, \\"Switching from dirty coal plants to dangerous nuclear power is like giving up smoking cigarettes and taking up crack.\\"http://www.newstrib.com/featured-series/energy- series/Articles/A_7-20-2007_1_4.pdf James Lovelock criticizes holders of such a view: \\"Opposition to nuclear energy is based on irrational fear fed by Hollywood-style fiction, the Green lobbies and the media.\\" \\". . .I am a Green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy.\\" George Monbiot, an English writer known for his environmental and political activism, once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry.George Monbiot \\"The nuclear winter draws near\\", The Guardian, 30 March 2000 He finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011. Although he \\"still loathe[s] the liars who run the nuclear industry\\", Monbiot now advocates its use, having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the 2011 Japan tsunami on nuclear reactors in the region. Subsequently, he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement, writing that it \\"has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health ... made [claims] ungrounded in science, unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong.\\" He singled out Helen Caldicott for, he wrote, making unsourced and inaccurate claims, dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up, and overstating the death toll from the Chernobyl disaster by a factor of more than 140.

He retired as the Knox Taylor Professor emeritus of geology and professor of geosciences at Princeton University. He currently serves as a visiting scholar in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University.  Life and main scientific contributions  After having received his BSc in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1957, he went to Princeton University, where he completed his PhD in 1964 under the supervision of Bob Dicke. He joined the faculty of the university immediately afterwards. His first major contribution, made in the late 1960s, was to relate the magnetic anomalies of alternating polarity, which occur on the ocean bottom at both sides of a mid-ocean ridge, to seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. From 1971 on he worked on the further development of the plume theory of Tuzo Wilson, which postulates the existence of roughly cylindrical convective upwellings in the Earth's mantle as an explanation of hotspots. Wilson originally applied the concept to Hawaii and explained the increase in age of the seamounts of the Hawaii-Emperor chain with increasing distance from the current hotspot location; however, the concept was subsequently applied to many other hotspots by Morgan and other scientists. Morgan has received many honors and awards for his work, among them the Alfred Wegener Medal of the European Geosciences Union (1983), the Maurice Ewing Medal of the American Geophysical Union (1987), the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London (1994) and the National Medal of Science of the USA, award year 2002.National Science Foundation, \\"W.

It is traditionally prepared in xiaolong, which is a kind of small bamboo steaming basket, which give them their name. Xiaolongbao is often referred to as a kind of \\"dumpling\\", but should not be confused with British or American-style dumplings, nor with Chinese jiaozi. They are also called a soup dumpling in English-speaking countries because they are filled with hot soup (and therefore must be eaten carefully). Making xiaolongbao at Nanxiang Mantou Dian, Roppongi Hills The perennial queue outside the Nanxiang Bun Shop in Shanghai Origins \\"Xiaolongbao\\" originated in Changzhou, Jiangsu, by Wan Hua Tea House, in the years of Daoguang Emperor (1820 to 1850). Xiaolongbao evolved from the guantangbao (soup-filled dumplings/buns) from Kaifeng, Henan province, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty (AD 960‚Äì1127). There are numerous styles of xiaolongbao in Jiangsu cuisine. Shanghai-style xiaolongbao originated in Nanxiang, which was a neighboring village of Shanghai in Jiangsu that eventually ended up becoming an outer suburb of Shanghai's Jiading District. The inventor of xiaolongbao sold them in his first store in Nanxiang next to the town's notable park, Guyi Garden. From there the xiaolongbao expanded into downtown Shanghai and outward. The Suzhou and Wuxi styles are larger (sometimes twice as large as a Nanxiang-style soup dumpling) and have sweeter fillings. The Nanjing style is smaller with an almost translucent skin and less meat. Two specialist xiaolongbao restaurants have a particularly long history. One is Nanxiang Mantou Dian (Nanxiang Bun Shop), which derives from the original store in Nanxiang but is now located in the Yu Garden area. It is famed for its crab-meat-filled buns. The other is Gulong Restaurant, at the original site next to Guyi Garden in Nanxiang. Ingredients Chinese buns, in general, may be divided into two types, depending on the degree of leavening of the flour skin.From the Annals of Jiading(a district in Shanghai) Buns can be made with leavened or unleavened dough. Those made with unleavened dough use clear water for mixing, the skin is thin and the fillings large. It is frequently made in Nanxiang but is imitated elsewhere, calling it Xiang- style. Steamed buns made with raised flour are seen throughout China and are what is usually referred to as mantou. Steamed xiaolongbao made with partially raised flour are more commonly seen in the south. This means that their skin is tender, smoother, and somewhat translucent, rather than being white and fluffy. As is traditional for buns of various sizes in the Jiangnan region, xiaolongbao is pinched at the top prior to steaming, so the skin has a circular cascade of ripples around the crown. Xiaolongbao is traditionally filled with pork. One popular and common variant is pork with minced crab meat and roe. More modern innovations include other meats, seafood, shrimp, crab meat, and vegetarian fillings. The characteristic soup-filled kind is created by wrapping solid meat aspic inside the skin alongside the meat filling. Heat from steaming then melts the gelatin-gelled aspic into soup. In modern times, refrigeration has made the process of making xiaolongbao during hot weather easier, since making gelled aspic is much more difficult at room temperature. Serving Traditionally, xiaolongbao is a kind of dim sum (√† la carte item) or \\"xiaochi\\" (snack). The buns are served hot in the bamboo baskets in which they were steamed, usually on a bed of dried leaves or paper mat, although some restaurants now use napa cabbage instead. The buns are usually dipped in Zhenjiang vinegar with ginger slivers. They are traditionally served with a clear soup on the side. Around Shanghai, \\"xiaolongbao\\" may be eaten throughout the day, although usually not for breakfast. They form part of a traditional Jiangnan-style morning tea (). In Guangdong and the West,<ref group=\\"note>the West refers to the Western world it is sometimes served as a dish during Cantonese tea time. Frozen xiaolongbao are now mass-produced and a popular frozen food sold worldwide. Related varieties The xiaolongbao is one of kind of tang bao (\\"soup bun\\").

He is best known for his dereliction of duty at the Battle of the Crater during the Siege of Petersburg. Early life Ledlie was born in Utica, New York. His obituary in the New York Times claimed he graduated from Union College, in Schenectady, New York, but the college has no record of his attendance there. Ledlie worked as a civil engineer on the Erie Canal and in railroad construction. Civil War Shortly after the start of the Civil War, Ledlie was appointed major of the 19th New York Infantry, which was subsequently renamed the 3rd New York Artillery regiment. The history of this regiment was marred by a mutiny at the expiration of its original term of service. Ledlie was promoted to colonel in December 1861, and was promoted to brigadier general in command of the Artillery Brigade of the Department of North Carolina in December 1862. (His appointment expired in March 1863 for lack of Senate confirmation, but he was reappointed in October 1863 and later confirmed.) For the next year and a half, he served primarily in garrison positions with North Carolina coastal artillery emplacements and in the Department of Virginia and North Carolina. Just after the start of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign in 1864, Ledlie transferred to the Army of the Potomac, commanding a brigade in Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside's IX Corps. On June 9, he was put in command of the 1st Division to succeed Brig. Gen Thomas G. Stevenson, who had been killed a few weeks earlier during the Battle of Spotsylvania. It was in this command that his brief military career was ruined. During the Siege of Petersburg, former coal miners in Burnside's corps devised an ingenious plan to lift the stalemate by digging a 511-foot tunnel under the Confederate lines, and filling the end of the tunnel with four tons of gunpowder. On July 30, 1864, they detonated the explosives, creating a crater some 135 feet in diameter that remains visible to this day. Some 250 to 350 Confederate soldiers were instantly killed in the blast. The Union plan was to exploit the explosion by sending well-rehearsed African-American troops of Edward Ferrero's division into the gap and driving for critical objectives deep in the Confederate rear area. However, Maj. Gen George Meade, the commander of the Army of the Potomac, ordered a column of white troops to make the lead assault on the crater instead of Ferrero's division of African American troops, who were trained specifically for the task. The change in battle formation was approved by General Ulysses S. Grant. In his later testimony before the Committee on the Conduct of the War, Meade claimed that he changed the order because the white troops were more experienced, not because he lacked faith in the capabilities of the African American troops.James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) Burnside, despondent at the change in plans, resorted to a lottery to select a replacement division. Ledlie drew the short straw and disaster resulted. His division was the smallest and weakest in the IX Corps, and he did not brief his troops beforehand and they entered the crater out of curiosity instead of moving safely around its rim, as Ferrero's division had been trained to do. Unable to exit the steep sides of the crater, they were slaughtered by Confederates firing down on them. 3,798 Union troops were casualties in the ill-fated battle that achieved none of its objectives. Most damning for Ledlie's reputation was the fact that he did not lead, or even accompany, his men into battle, and a few weeks earlier, during the attacks on Confederate entrenchments at Cold Harbor, he had run and hidden for cover, an event that the enlisted men didn't forget, but which managed to escape Burnside's attention. During the Battle of the Crater, Ledlie and Ferrero were observed behind the lines in a bunker, drinking liquor. Ledlie was criticized by a court of inquiry into his conduct that September, and in December he was effectively dismissed from the service by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, on orders from Gen. Grant. He formally resigned his commission on January 23, 1865. Postbellum career Ledlie resumed his career as a railroad civil engineer in the West and South. He participated in the construction of the transcontinental railroad as an employee of the Union Pacific. He also worked on constructing the Nevada Central Railroad line from Battle Mountain to Austin, Nevada, racing to get the 92-mile line built in half a year to meet a deadline before a bond issue expired. His crews got within two miles of the city limits of Austin before the deadline, and at the last minute town officials quickly extended the city limits to meet the tracks. Ledlie died in New Brighton, Staten Island in 1882, and is buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Utica, New York.

Smith taught with contemporaries Bruno Bobak, B.C. Binning and Jack Shadbolt at the Vancouver School of Art (now Emily Carr University of Art and Design) for ten years, then for twenty-six years at the University of British Columbia before retiring in 1982 to paint full-time. Early life and education He was born Gordon Appelbe Smith in East Brighton, England. His father, William George Smith, was an amateur watercolourist. He took Gordon and his brother Donald on frequent visits to the National Gallery, London and to the Tate. He attended the Harrow County School for Boys where Gordon received four years of formal art training and several prizes for his art. In 1933, Smith's parents separated. His mother Daisy Smith took the boys to live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Gordon did not see his father again until he went to England as an intelligence officer during World War II. From 1937 to 1940, he studied art at the Winnipeg School of Art. In 1939, during his third year of art school, Smith enrolled in the Royal Winnipeg Rifles. Before going overseas for war service, he took a vacation in Vancouver where he met and married Marion Fleming. In 1942, he joined the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. He was first a lieutenant, then a Platoon Commander and then the Intelligence Officer. In 1943, he was badly injured while landing at the beach in Leon Forte, Sicily. Art career In 1944, Smith returned to Vancouver where the Vancouver Art Gallery had a solo show for the work he produced overseas. He also attended the Vancouver School of Art in the same year to complete the fourth year of his art degree. From 1945 to 1954, Smith taught at the Vancouver School of Art. In 1947 he had his second solo show at Vancouver Art Gallery. In 1956 Smith was invited to train teachers in the new faculty of Education Department at UBC. In 1960, his highly experimental work is chosen to represent Canada at the S√£o Paulo Bienal. In 1965, at the request of Arthur Erickson, Smith designed two murals for Erickson's new Simon Fraser University campus building. The work, titled Mosaic Mural, is permanently installed along the sides of the west academic quadrangle. For EXPO '70 in Osaka, Japan, he was commissioned by Arthur Erickson to create an artwork for the Canadian Pavilion.https://www.arthurerickson.com/cultural- buildings/expo-70-canadian-pavilion/13/caption Awards and honours In 1995, Smith won the \\"Structure with Red Sun Award\\". He was named a member of the Order of Canada in 1996. He was an Education Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In 2007 he received the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts. In March 2009 at The National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, he was named a laureate and presented with the Governor General's Award in the Visual and Media Arts. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Collections Smith's works are included in the collections of the following museums: *Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec *National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa *the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. *Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England *Vancouver Art Gallery In 2009 his massive wall sculpture Beach Tangle was installed in the lobby of the West Vancouver Community Centre, one of the venues for celebration during the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Personal life In 1953, Gordon and Marion Smith moved to the North Shore of Vancouver into their first commissioned house from the architect Arthur Erickson. The need for a larger studio space prompted them to move to a second new house in West Vancouver, commissioned by friend Erickson in 1966. After Marion's death in 2009, Smith continued to live and work in their home. He died in Vancouver on January 18, 2020 at the age of 100.

The first Greek settlements were established in the Naples area in the 2nd millennium BC. During the end of the Greek Dark Ages a larger mainland colony - initially known as Parthenope - developed around the 9-8th century BC, and was refounded as Neapolis in the 6th century BC:Daniela Giampaola, Francesca Longobardo, Naples greek and roman, Electa Naples 2000 it held an important role in Magna Graecia. The Greek culture of Naples was important to later Roman society. When the city became part of the Roman Republic in the central province of the Empire, it was a major cultural center.History of Naples Virgil is an example of the political and cultural freedom of Naples. For centuries, Naples was the capital of the kingdom of Naples. The city has seen the rise and fall several civilizations and cultures, each of which has left traces in its art and architecture, and during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment was a major center of culture. During the Neapolitan War, the city rebelled against the Bourbon monarchs, spurring the early push towards Italian unification. Today Naples is part of the Italian Republic, the third largest municipality (central area) by population after Rome and Milano, and has the second or third largest metropolitan area of Italy. Greek birth, Roman acquisition Megaride in modern times, with the Castel dell'Ovo. The Naples area has been inhabited since the Stone Age. Settlers from two cities in Euboea, Greece, jointly colonised the nearby Cumae, the earliest Greek city on mainland Italy. The earliest founding of Naples itself is claimed in legend to be the Greek colony Phaleron (Latin: Phalerum), after the hero Phaleros, one of the Argonauts. However, the first Greek settlements had been established on the site during the 2nd millennium BC. At the end of the Greek Dark Ages a larger mainland colony ‚Äì initially known as Parthenope ‚Äì developed around the 9-8th century BC. Parthenope was the name of the siren in Greek mythology, said to have washed ashore at Megaride, having thrown herself into the sea after she failed to bewitch Ulysses with her song. Around this time Greeks became locked in a power struggle with the Etruscans, who sought to dominate the area. Etruscans attacked Cumae (524 BC) and, although the attack failed, it signaled a growing Etruscan determination to dominate the area, the pressure of which pushed Parthenope to the commercial margins. There is evidence that the city had slid into decadence and, some argue, had virtually ceased to exist. However, literary evidence shows that the city was destroyed because the hegemony of Cumae was threatened. Recent archaeological discoveries show that, in the 6th century (not in the 470 BC, after the battle of Cumae), the city was refounded and the new urban zone of Neapolis (ŒùŒµŒ¨œÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ) was founded inland, eventually becoming one of the foremost cities of Magna Graecia. The primitive center of Parthenope on the hill of Pizzofalcone came to be called simply Palaipolis (Latin: Palaepolis), the \\"old city\\". Neapolis had a powerful line of walls, in front of which the Carthaginian invader Hannibal had to retreat when the city was allied with the Romans. Other features were an odeon and a theatre, and the temple of the city's patron gods, the Dioscuri. Although conquered by the Samnites during the fifth century BC, and then the Romans,Touring Club of Italy, Naples: The City and Its Famous Bay, Capri, Sorrento, Ischia, and the Amalfi, Milano, February 2003 Naples long retained its Greek culture; it is significant In the Roman era the city was a flourishing centre of Hellenistic culture that attracted Romans who wished to perfect their knowledge of Greek culture. The pleasant climate made it a renowned resort, as recounted by Virgil and manifested in the numerous luxurious villas that dotted the coast from the Gulf of Pozzuoli to the Sorrentine peninsula. The famous district of Posillipo takes its name from the ruins of Villa Paus√≠lypon, meaning, in Greek, \\"a pause, or respite, from worry\\". Romans connected the city to the rest of Italy with their famous roads, excavated galleries to link Naples to Pozzuoli, enlarged the port, and added public baths and aqueducts to improve the quality of life in Naples. The city was also celebrated for its many feasts and spectacles. Parthenope as patroness According to legend, the saints Peter and Paul came to the city to preach. Christians had a prominent role in the late years of the Roman Empire, and there are several notable catacombs, especially in the northern part of the city. The first pal√¶o- Christian basilicas were built next to the entrances to the catacombs. The greatly popular patron of the city, San Gennaro (St. Januarius), was decapitated in nearby Pozzuoli in AD 305, and, since the 5th century, he has been commemorated by the basilica of San Gennaro extra Moenia. The Cathedral of Naples is also dedicated to St. Gennaro. It was in Naples, in Lucullus' Villa in what is now the Castel dell'Ovo, that Romulus Augustulus, the last nominal western emperor was imprisoned after being deposed in 476. Naples suffered much during the Gothic Wars between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines during the 6th century. In 536, it decided to resist Belisarius's invasion. However, his troops captured the city by entering through its aqueduct. With the changing tide of the war in the 540s, it was starved into surrender by Totila, who treated it leniently. During Narses's expedition during the 550s, it was captured by the Empire once again. When the Lombards invaded and conquered much of Italy in the following years, Naples remained loyal to the Eastern Roman Empire. The Duchy of Naples At the time of the Lombard invasion, Naples had a population of about 30,000-35,000. In 615, under Giovanni Consino, Naples rebelled for the first time against the Exarch of Ravenna, the emperor's plenipotentiary in Italy. In reply, the first form of duchy was created in 638 by the Exarch Isaac or Eleutherius (exarchic chronology is uncertain), but this official came from abroad and had to answer to the strategos of Sicily. At that time the Duchy of Naples controlled an area corresponding roughly to the present day Province of Naples, encompassing the area of Vesuvius, the Campi Flegrei, the Sorrentine peninsula, Giugliano, Aversa, Afragola, Nola and the islands of Ischia and Procida. Capri was later part of the duchy of Amalfi In 661 Naples, with the permission of the emperor Constans II, was ruled by a local duke, Basilius, whose allegiance to the emperor soon became merely nominal. In 763 the duke Stephen II switched his allegiance from Constantinople to the Pope. In 840 Duke Sergius I made the succession to the duchy hereditary, and thenceforth Naples was de facto totally independent. At this time the city was mainly a military centre, ruled by an aristocracy of warriors and landowners, even though it had been forced to surrender to the neighbouring Lombards much of its inland territory. Naples was not a merchant city as were other Campanian sea cities such as Amalfi and Gaeta, but had a respectable fleet that took part in the Battle of Ostia against the Saracens in 849. In any event, Naples did not hesitate to ally itself with infidels if it proved advantageous to do so: in 836, for example, Naples asked for support from the Saracens in order to repel the siege of Lombard troops coming from the neighbouring Duchy of Benevento. Later, Muhammad I Abu 'l-Abbas led its Muslim conquest of Naples and managed to sack it and take huge amount of its wealth.Hilmar C. Krueger. \\"The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095\\" in A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, Vol.I. Kenneth Meyer Setton, Marshall W. Baldwin (eds., 1955). University of Pennsylvania Press. p.48. After Neapolitan dukes rose to prominence under the Duke-Bishop Athanasius and his successors (among these, Gregory IV and John II participated at the Battle of the Garigliano in 915), Naples declined in importance in the 10th century until it was captured by its traditional rival, Pandulf IV of Capua. In 1027, duke Sergius IV donated the county of Aversa to a band of Norman mercenaries led by Rainulf Drengot, whose support he had needed in the war with the principality of Capua. In that period he could not imagine the consequences, but this settlement began a process which eventually led to the end of the independence of Naples. Last of the rulers of such independent southern Italian states, Sergius VII was forced to surrender to Roger II of Sicily in 1137; Roger had had himself proclaimed king of Sicily seven years earlier. Under the new rulers, the city was administrated by a compalazzo (palatine count), with little independence left to the Neapolitan patriciate. In this period Naples had a population of 30,000 and was sustained by its holdings in the interior; commerce was mainly delegated to foreigners, mainly from Pisa and Genoa. Apart from the church of San Giovanni a Mare, Norman buildings in Naples were mainly lay ones, notably castles (Castel Capuano and Castel dell'Ovo), walls and fortified gates. The Castel Nuovo (\\"New Castle\\") was renovated and chosen as his palace by Charles I of Anjou. The entrance is decorated by a Renaissance Arch of Triumph celebrating the entrance in the city of the Aragonese king Alfonso I (15th century) Normans, Hohenstaufen, and Anjou After a period of Norman rule, in 1189 the Kingdom of Sicily was in a succession dispute between Tancred, King of Sicily of an illegitimate birth and the Hohenstaufens, a German royal house, as its Prince Henry had married Princess Constance the last legitimate heir to the Sicilian throne. In 1191 Henry invaded Sicily after being crowned as Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor and many cities surrendered, but Naples resisted him from May to August under the leadership of Richard, Count of Acerra, Nicholas of Ajello, Aligerno Cottone and Margaritus of Brindisi before the Germans suffered from disease and were forced to retreat. Conrad II, Duke of Bohemia and Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne died of disease during the siege. In light of this Tancred achieved another unexpected achievement that his contender Constance, now empress, was captured at Salerno while those cities surrendered to Germans resubmitted to Tancred. Tancred had the empress imprisoned at Castel dell'Ovo at Naples before her release in May 1192. In 1194 Henry started his second campaign upon the death of Tancred, but this time Aligerno surrendered without resistance, and finally Henry conquered Sicily, putting it under the rule of Hohenstaufens. Frederick II Hohenstaufen founded the university in 1224, considering Naples as his intellectual capital while Palermo retained its political role. The university remained unique in southern Italy for seven centuries. After the defeat of Frederick's son, Manfred, in 1266 Naples and the kingdom of Sicily were assigned by Pope Clement IV to Charles of Anjou, who moved the capital from Palermo to Naples. He settled in his new residence in the Castel Nuovo, around which a new district grew up, marked by palaces and residences of the nobility. During Charles' reign new Gothic churches were also built, including Santa Chiara, San Lorenzo Maggiore and the Cathedral of Naples. After the Sicilian Vespers, (1284) the kingdom was split in two parts, with an Aragonese king ruling the island of Sicily and the Angevin king ruling the mainland portion; while both kingdoms officially called themselves the Kingdom of Sicily, the mainland portion was commonly referred to as the Kingdom of Naples. The Hungarian Angevin king Louis the Great captured the city several times. The kingdom had been divided in two, but Naples grew in importance: Pisan and Genoese merchants were joined by Tuscan bankers, and with them came outstanding artists such as Boccaccio, Petrarca, and Giotto. See also Kingdom of Naples The Aragonese period Idealized depiction of Naples from the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle. In 1442 Alfonso I conquered Naples after his victory against the last Angevin king, Rene, and made his triumphal entry into the city in February 1443. The new dynasty enhanced commerce by connecting Naples to the Iberian peninsula and made Naples a centre of the Italian Renaissance: artists who worked in Naples in this period include Francesco Laurana, Antonello da Messina, Jacopo Sannazzaro and Angelo Poliziano. The court also granted land holdings in the provinces to the nobility; this, however, had the effect of fragmenting the kingdom. After the brief conquest by Charles VIII of France in 1495, the two kingdoms were united under Aragonese rule in 1501. In 1502 Castilian general Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba entered in the city. Although Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba was Castilian, he conquered under the command of Ferdinand II of Aragon. Ferdinand and his wife Isabella I of Castile ruled their kingdoms jointly in personal union during their marriage. But the partnership of the Catholic Monarchs ceased with Isabella's death in 1504, and Ferdinand expelled the Castilians from leadership in Aragonese possessions in Italy, including Naples.Charles E. Nowell, \\"Old World Origins of the Spanish- American Viceregal System\\" in First Images of America. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1976, p. 225. The conquest began nearly two centuries of rule of the almost omnipotent vicer√© (\\"viceroys\\") in Naples. Palazzo Reale (Royal Palace) was the seat of Spanish and Austrian viceroys. Under the viceroys Naples grew from 100,000 to 300,000 inhabitants, second only to Istanbul in Europe. The most important of them was don Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo: he introduced heavy taxation and favoured the Inquisition, but at the same time improved the conditions of Naples. He opened the main street, which still today bears his name; he paved other roads, strengthened and expanded the walls, restored old buildings, and erected new buildings and fortresses, essentially turning the city of Naples by 1560 into the largest and best fortified city in the Spanish empire. In the 16th and 17th century Naples was home to great artists such as Caravaggio, Salvator Rosa and Bernini, philosophers such as Bernardino Telesio, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella and Giambattista Vico, and writers such as Gian Battista Marino, thus confirming itself among the most important capitals of Europe. All these cultural figures contributed to the aesthetic and intellectual transformations leading to a new era, commonly defined as Baroque. Patrons and salon-holders such as Aurora Sanseverino, Isabella Pignone del Carretto and Ippolita Cantelmo Stuart had a significant role in the artistic and cultural life in Naples. All the strains of an increasingly over-populated city exploded in July 1647, when the legendary Masaniello led the populace in violent rebellion against the foreign, oppressive rule of the Spanish. Neapolitans declared a Republic and asked France for support, but the Spaniards suppressed the insurrection in April of the following year and defeated two attempts by the French fleet to land troops. In 1656 the plague killed almost half of the inhabitants of the city; this led to the beginning of a period of decline.

Painting by Gaspar Butler. =1714 to 1799= The Spanish Habsburgs were replaced in 1714 by Austrian ones, until in 1734 the two kingdoms were united under a single independent crown (Utriusque Siciliarum), that of Charles of Bourbon. Charles renovated the city with the Villa di Capodimonte and the Teatro di San Carlo, and welcomed the philosophers Giovan Battista Vico and Antonio Genovesi, the jurists Pietro Giannone and Gaetano Filangieri, and the composers Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. This first king of the House of Bourbon tried to introduce legislative and administrative reforms, but they were stopped as the first news of the French Revolution reached the city. By that time, Charles' son, Ferdinand IV was king, and he entered an anti-French Coalition with Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, and Portugal. The Bay of Naples, by Joseph Vernet, 1748 The population of Naples at the beginning of the 19th century was mostly made up of a mass of people, who were called the lazzarone and lived in extremely poor conditions. As well, there was a strong royal bureaucracy and an √©lite of landowners. When in January 1799 French revolutionary troops entered the city they were hailed by a pro- revolutionary minor part of the middle class, but had to face strong resistance by the royalist lazzari, who were fervidly religious and did not support the new ideas. The short-lived Neapolitan Republic tried to gain popular support by abolishing feudal privileges, but the mass of the people rebelled and in June 1799 the republicans surrendered. Upon the order of the restored monarchy, Admiral Horatio Nelson arrested the leaders of the revolution and handed them over for execution Francesco Caracciolo, Mario Pagano, Ettore Carafa, and Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel. Nelson was rewarded by being made Duke of Bronte by the king. =1799-1861= The Theatre of San Carlo was built during the reign of Charles I of Bourbon The Parthenopaean Republic in Naples was suppressed by the British and Russians in 1799, and was following in 1805 by a full invasion. In early 1806 Napoleon conquered the Kingdom of Naples. The Emperor Napoleon first named his brother Joseph Bonaparte to be King and then his brother-in-law and Marshal Joachim Murat in 1808, when Joseph was given the Spanish crown. The latter created a communal administration led by a mayor, which was left almost intact by Ferdinand in 1815 as he regained his kingdom after the 1815 Neapolitan War in which the Austrians defeated Murat. In 1839 Naples was the first city in Italy to have a railway, with the Napoli-Portici line. In spite of a little cultural revival and the proclamation of a Constitution on June 25, 1860, in the last years of the kingdom the gap between the court and the intellectual class continued to grow. On September 6, 1861, the kingdom was conquered by the Garibaldines and was handed over to the King of Sardinia: Garibaldi entered the city by train, descending in the square that today still bears his name. In October 1860 a plebiscite sanctioned the end of the Kingdom of Sicily and the birth of new Italian state, the United Kingdom of Italy. Galleria Umberto, 1887‚Äì91. Contemporary age The opening of the funicular railway to Mount Vesuvius was occasion for the writing of the famous song \\"Funicul√¨, Funicul√†\\", one more song in the centuries long tradition of Neapolitan song. Many Neapolitan songs are also famous outside of Italy, as for example \\"O Sole Mio\\", \\"Santa Lucia\\" and \\"Torna a Surriento\\". On April 7, 1906 nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted, devastating Boscotrecase and seriously damaging Ottaviano. During World War II, Naples was the first Italian city to rise up against the Nazi military occupation; between September 28 and October 1, 1943 the people of the city rose up and pushed the Germans out, in what became known as the \\"four days of Naples\\". British Armoured patrols of the King's Dragoon Guards were the first allied unit to reach Naples. They were followed by the Royal Scots Greys followed by troops of the US 82nd Airborne Division; they found Naples already free, and continued on instead towards Rome. In 1944 another devastating eruption from Vesuvius occurred; images from this eruption were used in the film The War of the Worlds. Napoli has turned into the most important transportation hub of southern Italy. The airport of Capodichino has connections with several airports in Europe. The city also has an important port that connects to many Tyrrhenian Sea destinations, including Cagliari, Genoa and Palermo, often with fast ferries. Naples also has ferry connections to nearby islands and Sorrento, and fast rail connections to Rome and the south. It is famous for the light railway Circumvesuviana. Organised crime is deeply rooted in Naples. The Camorra, the feuding Neapolitan gangs and families, have a long history. During 2004 over 120 people died in Naples in Camorra killings; many of the deaths were related to the drug trade. Unemployment remains very high in Naples, with some estimates running above 20% among working-age males. The industrial base is still small and a number of earlier and ambitious enterprises such as automobile manufacturing plants on the outskirts have closed and gone elsewhere. There is a large \\"submerged economy\\"‚Äîmeaning the black market‚Äîand it is difficult to have reliable statistics on the amount of wealth generated by such activity. Social services in the city have come under recent strain in attempting to deal with the increase in immigration. In 1927 Naples absorbed some nearby communities; the 1860 population of 450,000 increased to 1,250,000 in 1971. Cosmetically, at least, Naples improved in the two decades either side of the turn of the 21st century: Piazza del Plebiscito, for example, has returned to its historic role as the largest open square in the city instead of being the squalid parking lot that it was between the end of WWII and 1990; city landmarks such as the San Carlo theater and the Galleria Umberto have been restored; a major ring road, the tangenziale di Napoli, has alleviated traffic through and around the city; and major construction continues on the new underground railway system, the Naples Metro (metropolitana di Napoli), which, even its current unfinished state now provides easy transportation for the first time in the history of the city from the upper reaches of the Vomero hill section of the city into the downtown area. As a result of at least some of these improved conditions in the city, tourism has increased. As a matter of fact, Naples became the world's 91st richest city by purchasing power in 2005, with a GDP of US$43 billion, surpassing cities such as Budapest and Zurich, and unemployment decreased dramatically between the 1990s and 2010.

After retirement, Pumpido moved into club management. His nephew Facundo Pumpido, is also a professional footballer. Club career Pumpido began his career at his home city side Uni√≥n de Santa Fe. After a brief stint for V√©lez S√°rsfield, where his form saw him called up for the 1982 FIFA World Cup squad, he moved to Club Atl√©tico River Plate to replace the departing national 'keeper Ubaldo Fillol. Here, he became part of the side that won the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n as well as the Copa Libertadores for the first time in its history in 1986 under manager H√©ctor Veira. In 1988, he transferred to Spanish club Real Betis where, in 1989, he almost lost a finger during a training session when his wedding ring caught on a nail in the crossbar of the goal. He returned to Argentina to his first club, Union in 1991. His last season was at the Lanus Athletic Club in 1993, and then he retired from football. International career Although chosen by Argentinian coach C√©sar Luis Menotti as the third goalkeeper of the Argentinian national team in the 1982 World Cup, he did not play in the tournament. Pumpido eventually made his international debut against Paraguay the following year. He was the starting goalkeeper during Argentina's victorious 1986 World Cup campaign, playing in all seven games, conceding just five goals in 630 minutes of football, and keeping three clean sheets. At the 1990 World Cup, Pumpido was at fault for Cameroon's winning goal, fumbling Fran√ßois Omam-Biyik's header into the net as the African nation shocked the defending champions at the tournament's opening game in Milan, winning by a goal to nil. Pumpido then broke his leg in the eleventh minute of Argentina's second game against the USSR. He was replaced by substitute Sergio Goycochea (also his understudy at River Plate), who had not played a game in eight months. Goycochea eventually became key to Argentina's run to the final, saving penalty shoot-out kicks in the quarter final win over Yugoslavia and the semi-final victory over hosts Italy. Coaching career After retiring as a player, Pumpido went into management. After several seasons at Uni√≥n de Santa Fe he took over at Paraguayan side Olimpia, from the capital city of Asunci√≥n, winning the Copa Libertadores in 2002. After resigning from Olimpia due to a lack of \\"[...] support from the president\\", he then became coach of UANL Tigres in Mexico, reaching the final of the 2003‚Äì04 Primera Divisi√≥n de M√©xico championship. Between October 2005 and July 2006, Pumpido coached Argentinian Primera Divisi√≥n club Newell's Old Boys, followed by brief stints at Mexican club side CD Veracruz and Saudi club Al-Shabab, before his return to Olimpia, Paraguay's most successful football club and winner of three Libertadores cups, as well as one Intercontinental cup. On 23 December 2011, he was hired as coach of the Argentinian club Godoy Cruz. On 3 September 2012, he returned to Uni√≥n de Santa Fe for a second spell as manager.

He was the last Hispanic mayor of the city until 2005. Background Aguilar, also known as Cristoval, was born in California in 1816 to Jose Mar√≠a Aguilar and Mar√≠a Ygnacia Elizalde.John P. Schmal, \\"The Four Hispanic Mayors of Los Angeles,\\" HispanicVista.com, May 23, 2005 The Aguilars lived in an adobe facing the Los Angeles Plaza on what is now North Main Street. This house was a prominent landmark that later served as the town calabozo, or jail, and then as the town's first hospital, in 1858.Clare Wallace, Los Angeles Public Library biography, May 9, 1938, from sources, cited there On October 31, 1848, Aguilar married Maria Dolores Yorba at the San Gabriel Mission. His wife was the daughter of Jos√© Antonio de los Remidios Yorba and Mar√≠a Catalina Verdugo. The Yorbas possessed vast land holdings including most of the Santa Ana Valley (in present-day Orange County, California). In the 1870 census, the Aguilars had four children living with them: Librada, 19; Jose M., 17; Matias, 12; Guadalupe, 10, and Rosa, 7. Aguilar could not speak English, but, as reported by Los Angeles historian H.D. Barrows in 1899, he \\"made a good and acceptable Mayor because of the general familiarity of citizens of all nationalities then residing here, with the Spanish tongue.\\" Political life Aguilar \\"held prominent office under Mexican rule as far back as 1883-4.\\"\\"Death of Ex-Mayor Aguilar,\\" Los Angeles Herald, April 13, 1886, page 1 After the transfer of California from Mexico to the United States, the Mexican ayuntamiento was abolished in favour of a city council system. A Democrat, Aguilar was elected to the new Los Angeles Common Council on July 1, 1850, and he served in 1850-51, 1855‚Äì56, 1858‚Äì59 and 1861-62. He was mayor of Los Angeles in 1866-67, 1867‚Äì68 and 1870-72. Aguilar was elected to the Board of Supervisors three times, serving in 1854-56, 1860 and 1862-64.John P. Schmal, \\"The Election of Cristobal Aguilar,\\" LatinoLA, October 5, 2005 Aguilar was first elected mayor on May 7, 1866. The election was certified three days later and he assumed office that same day. In that same year he signed an ordinance to set aside five acres of land as a \\"Public Square or Plaza, for the use and benefit of the Citizens in common,\\" which land later was named Pershing Square. Aguilar was unseated for three months in the middle of his first term and replaced by Damien Marchesseault. During that time he served as zanjero or Water Overseer. With Los Angeles being in a Mediterranean climate and risks of both drought and flooding a constant threat, this position was actually considered more important than the mayor and paid the highest salary of any city official at the time. On August 8, 1867, Aguilar was reinstated as mayor and served the remainder of his term. His decision in 1868 to retain control over the city's water rights and reserves is considered one of the most important in Los Angeles' history. In 1868, Aguilar lost re-election to Joel Turner and was subsequently appointed as Water Overseer once again. Aguilar was elected mayor in 1870 over Andrew Glassell by a vote of 436 to 428, and he was installed despite a requested recount. He was defeated for reelection in 1872 by J.R. Toberman in a vote of 715 for Toberman and 350 for Aguilar. During that election, Toberman \\"made an issue\\" of Aguilar's \\"poor English.\\" Historian John P. Schmal noted that: > When Aguilar became Mayor, there were less than 6,000 residents in the City. > When the city council proposed selling off the city's water rights to bring > in additional revenue, Aguilar vetoed the proposal. If Aguilar had not used > his power of veto, Los Angeles would have lost control of its water rights, > leading to serious problems at a later date. In December 1873, Aguilar was again appointed as zanjero by a vote in the Common Council of 7-2 over T.H. Eaton.\\"Common Council,\\" Los Angeles Daily Herald, January 1, 1874, page 1, columns 1 and 2 Aguilar served until December 5, 1878.

He died of a heart attack on April 11, 1886, at the age of 70. The Los Angeles Herald wrote of him in an obituary: > He was at one time a wealthy man and brought up a large family with much > care, giving each a good education.

It was sometimes known as the Hayling Billy, which is now the name of a footpath along the old track which is a Local Nature Reserve.\\"The Hayling Billy Leisure Trail\\" Marshall, B Havant, Bosmere Hundred Society, 1992  History  The line was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) for goods on 19 January 1865, and for passengers on 16 July 1867.\\"Catching the train to Hayling Island: a history\\" Newell, L: Havant, Havant Borough Council, 2005 (2003) It ran from Havant to Hayling Island station.

Neither were ever \\"halts\\", in spite of their small size.Hampshire railways remembered Oppitz,L Newbury, Countryside 1988 The LBSCR quickly ran into difficulty during the construction of the railway, as they had attempted to save on the cost of buying land on Hayling Island for the line by constructing an embankment on the mud flats in the sheltered waters of Langstone Harbour. This was an ambitious plan, which also involved the construction of wet and dry docks at Sinah Lake. They were given a grant to the mudlands by William Padwick, who was himself behind the plan, and the promoters offered to build the embankment and Railway at a cost of ¬£80,000,called South Hayling until 1892 \\"Branch Line to Hayling\\" Mitchell,V./Smith,K (In association with Bell,A): Midhurst, Middleton Press, 1984 but the area was not sheltered as had been hoped and the bank was severely eroded before the railway could be completed. The Board of Trade inspector was invited to certify the line as being fit for passenger traffic, but he initially refused to do so as he found that many of the sleepers had begun to rot in the original section of the railway, and there was also an unauthorised level crossing at Langstone. The former problem was quickly fixed but the level crossing remained until the closure of the line. The line itself was mainly used during the summer months as people from the South Coast travelled down to the beach on Hayling Island. The coaches were often overflowing during these months, but were almost empty during the winter.\\"Southern Holiday Lines in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight\\" Bennett,A Cheltenham, Runpast 1994 The line was taken over by the Southern Railway in 1923 and by British Railways in 1948. Because of the weight restriction on the bridge\\"The Book of Hayling Island-more than a millennium\\"Rogers,P: Tiverton, Halsgrove, 2000 it was worked, from late Victorian times to closure in 1963 by small LB&SCR; A1/A1X Class locomotives.Memories of the Hayling Island Branch:Produced by Ian Heys for \\"Branch Line Videos\\", Catalogue Number 418-514424  Closure  Over the winter of 1962 it was decided to close the branchClosure details because the timber swing bridge which crossed Langstone Harbour needed to be replaced. The line was operating at a small profit but British Railways took the view that the cost of a new bridge was an unreasonably large investment. The final normal service train ran on the evening of 2 November 1963. Goods services continued until the final day but goods trains were not run separately. Instead goods were conveyed in mixed trains (passenger coaches, goods wagons and vans, and a brake van) and these were a feature of the branch until the end. To clear the remaining goods stock away, the final train from Hayling Island on Saturday 2 November 1963 was a mixed train hauled by A1X no. 32650. The day after closure a special was run, hauled by A1X nos. 32636 and 32670 and this was the last ever train on the branch. All three of these locomotives survive in preservation.  After closure and the line today  After closure, an attempt was made to re-open the line, using a former Blackpool Marton Vambac single deck tram, no. 11. The tram was stored in the goods yard at Havant, and later, on Hayling Island itself. With no support from the local authorities the venture came to nothing and the tram never ran on the line. Unlike the line, however, the tram survived, and is currently preserved in running order at the East Anglia Transport Museum. The attempted re-opening delayed the lifting of the track. This finally took place in the Spring of 1966, and included the demolition of most of the structure of the railway bridge at Langstone. A significant amount of the bridge remains, including the base of the swinging section, and what seem to be bridge piers. The bridge piers are, in fact, the lower parts of the wooden bridge structure which were enclosed in rectangular columns of concrete by the Southern Railway in the late 1920s, early 1930s. The columns stand on the bridge foundations, which were specially strengthened to deal with the tidal scour at this location. Today, the area where the tracks once stood on the Havant side of the line is a Local Nature Reserve and footpath. This enables people to walk from Havant station all the way to where the bridge and the level crossing was located, by Langston station, serving the village of Langstone.\\"A Guide to Hayling Island\\" Pierce Jones,V/Walton,R. :Hayling Island, waltondesign, 2005 If one were to continue walking south from Langston station (the railway never spelled it with the final \\"e\\"), across the road bridge, they would join the Hayling Island side of the line. This section of the line passes down the west side of the island, passing through where North Hayling station used to stand, and terminates at West Town, the main area of population in the south of the island. Sadly, due to an arson attack, the old Crossing keepers' cottages near Langston railway station unexpectedly caught fire in December 2018 and were almost completely destroyed. The property company owning the site has been ordered to rebuild them. https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/campaigners-over- the-moon-as-council-orders-rebuild-of-fire-ravaged-langstone-railway- cottages-1-8762719 Langstone rail bridge turntable This section is now a combined footpath, bridleway and cycleway.

Alfred Enneper and Karl Weierstrass studied minimal surfaces as far back as 1863. Weierstrass parameterization facilities fabrication of periodic minimal surfaces Let ∆í and g be functions on either the entire complex plane or the unit disk, where g is meromorphic and ∆í is analytic, such that wherever g has a pole of order m, f has a zero of order 2m (or equivalently, such that the product ∆íg2 is holomorphic), and let c1, c2, c3 be constants. Then the surface with coordinates (x1,x2,x3) is minimal, where the xk are defined using the real part of a complex integral, as follows: \\\\begin{align} x_k(\\\\zeta) &{}= \\\\Re \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\zeta} \\\\varphi_{k}(z) \\\\, dz \\\\right\\\\\\\\} + c_k , \\\\qquad k=1,2,3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi_1 &{}= f(1-g^2)/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi_2 &{}= \\\\mathbf{i} f(1+g^2)/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi_3 &{}= fg \\\\end{align} The converse is also true: every nonplanar minimal surface defined over a simply connected domain can be given a parametrization of this type. For example, Enneper's surface has ∆í(z) = 1, g(z) = z^m. Parametric surface of complex variables The Weierstrass- Enneper model defines a minimal surface X (\\\\mathbb{R}^3) on a complex plane (\\\\mathbb{C}).

Wiseman, Remus: a Roman myth, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.133. The Romans celebrated Liberalia with sacrifices, processions, ribald and gauche songs, and masks which were hung on trees. This feast celebrates the maturation of young boys to manhood. Roman boys, usually at age 15 or 16, would remove the bulla praetexta, a hollow charm of gold or leather, which parents placed about the necks of children to ward off evil spirits. At the Liberalia ceremony the young men might place the bulla on an altar (with a lock of hair or the stubble of his first shave placed inside) and dedicate it to the Lares, who were gods of the household and family. Mothers often retrieved the discarded bulla praetexta and kept it out of superstition. If the son ever achieved a public triumph, the mother could display the bulla to ward off any evil that might be wished upon the son by envious people. The young men discarded the toga praetexta, which was probably derived from Etruscan dress and was decorated with a broad purple border and worn with the bulla, by boys and girls. The boys donned the clothing of adulthood, the pure white toga virilis, or \\"man's gown\\". The garment identified him as a citizen of Rome, making him an eligible voter. The celebration on March 17 was meant to honor Liber Pater, an ancient god of fertility and wine (like Bacchus, the Roman version of the Greek god Dionysus). Liber Pater is also a vegetation god, responsible for protecting seed. Liber, again like Dionysus, had female priests although Liber's priests were older women. Wearing wreaths of ivy, the priestesses made special cakes, or libia, of oil and honey which passing devotees would have them sacrifice on their behalf. Over time this feast evolved and included the goddess Libera, Liber Pater's consort, and the feast divided so that Liber governed the male seed and Libera the female. Ovid in his almanac entry for the festival identifies Libera as the celestial manifestation of Ariadne.Fasti 3.459-516. This ancient Italian ceremony was a \\"country\\" or rustic ceremony. The processional featured a large phallus which the devotees carried throughout the countryside to bring the blessing of fertility to the land and the people. The procession and the phallus were meant also to protect the crops from evil. At the end of the procession, a virtuous and respected matron placed a wreath upon the phallus. Related to the celebration of the Liberalia is the Procession of the Argei, celebrated on March 16 and 17. The Argei were 27 sacred shrines created by the Numina (very powerful ancient gods who are divine beings without form or face) and found throughout the regions of Rome. However, modern scholars have not discovered their meaning or use. In the argei celebration, 30 figures also called Argei were fashioned from rushes into shapes resembling men; later in the year they were tossed into the river(s). The origin of this celebration is not certain, but many scholars feel that it may have been a ritualistic offering meant to appease and praise the Numa and that the 30 argei probably represented the thirty elder Roman curiae, or possibly represented the 30 Latin townships. Other ancient scholars wrote that the use of the bull-rush icons was meant to deter celebrants from human sacrifice, which was done to honor Saturn. Some historical documents indicate that the argei (the sacred places) took their names from the chieftains who came with Hercules, the Argive, to Rome and then occupied the Capitoline (Saturnian) Hill. There is no way at present to verify this information, but it does coincide with the belief that Rome was founded by the Pelasgians and the name Argos is linked to that group. While Liberalia is a relatively unknown event in modern times, references to Liberalia and the Roman goddess Libera are still found today online and in astrology.

Population: History The strategic height overlooking the Klyazma River was of great importance for defending approaches to the medieval Russian capital of Vladimir. To that effect, a fortress was established there some time in the 12th century, most likely in the 1130s. The Yaropolk fortress took its name from one prince named Yaropolk. It was situated about halfway between the nearest Klyazma ports: Starodub-on-the- Klyazma and Gorokhovets. After the Mongols destroyed the fortress in 1238, Yaropolk was next documented in the 1389 treaty between Vasily I and his uncle Vladimir the Bold. The selo of Vyazniki likely appeared slightly downhill from Yaropolk in the end of the 16th century; its first mention in the documents was in 1608 and it quickly developed into a merchant sloboda. When Yaropolk was annihilated by fire in 1703, Vyazniki came to dominate the area. In 1778, Vyazniki was granted town status. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Vyazniki serves as the administrative center of Vyaznikovsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Resolution #433 As a municipal division, the town of Vyazniki, together with sixty-two rural localities in Vyaznikovsky District, is incorporated within Vyaznikovsky Municipal District as Vyazniki Urban Settlement.Law #62-OZ Economy As of the beginning of the 21st century, Vyazniki is one of the centers of the flax industry of Russia.

The island was named by Captain Bedwell after his sub-lieutenant, George Sidney Lindeman whilst aboard the Royal Navy vessel . Most of the island is included in the Lindeman Islands National Park which also protects another 13 islands. There is also a resort and an airport on the island. Lindeman Island was created after a volcanic mountain range was drowned by rising sea levels. History The island was occupied by Aboriginal tribes, known generally as the Ngaro, until circa 1900, who used the area for fishing. It is unknown if they lived on the island permanently. An incident occurred on nearby Shaw Island between the local tribe and some Europeans in late August 1861. One aboriginal was shot dead and Henry Irving, a squatter from Broadsound, and Nicholas Millar, a sailor from Rockhampton, were bludgeoned to death. The Native Police officer at the logging camp of Eugene Fitzalan on Whitsunday Island was notified. A large punitive mission afterwards set out in two schooners under Lieut. Williams. They destroyed the native camp and burnt or impounded all the canoes found. The aboriginals themselves apparently escaped into the mountainous terrain. They resisted later attempts to be relocated to the mainland. In 1905 Captain James AddertonCreating Island Resorts, Brian King, 1997, took out a sheep grazing lease over the island and established facilities for shearing. In 1923 Angus Nicholson began a small lodge for visitors, although he did not build permanent accommodation until 1929. The Nicholsons had local Ngaro people working for them on the island. Goats roamed wild and visitors were requested to shoot only for food. Before the end of WW2, Reg Ansett of Ansett Australia saw the potential of the area and began planning for air services. Starting in 1952 Barrier Reef Airways began flying boat services to a number of islands including Lindeman. Ansett opened Proserpine or Whitsunday Coast Airport in 1957 to allow transfers to smaller island aircraft. The resort was sold to P&O; shipping in 1974, who then sold the resort to Club Med in 1992. Resort The resort was the first Club Med established in the Whitsunday Islands and in 1992 became the only Club Med village in Australia. Lindeman Island resort was closed on 31 January 2012. On the 27 April 2012 it was purchased by White Horse Holding, a Chinese firm, for $12 million. The price paid was considerably lower than expected because the resort needed refurbishment. White Horse are planning to redevelop the Island into three luxury resorts (5 star beach resort, 6 star spa resort, and 6 star eco resort) including upgrading the airstrip and facilities, a proposed 'safe harbour' where approximately 50 boats will be able to moor, two tourist villa precincts and a central village that will have a number of restaurants and cafes, sporting facilities, retail shops and communal recreation areas. The Lindeman Island Project is currently going through what is known as the ‚ÄòEnvironmental impact statement process‚Äô (EIS) If a ‚Äòcoordinated project‚Äô has the potential to cause environmental, social or economic impacts, the project proponent must prepare an environmental impact statement. White Horse are anticipating an approval late this year with construction to begin in 2017. See also * List of islands of Australia References External links *Lindeman Island.

On 5 December 2011, al-Mahafdha, Rajab, and Mohammed Al-Maskati of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights were named in a death threat by Adel Flaifel, a former State Securities Services official, causing the International Federation for Human Rights and World Organisation Against Torture to call for an international letter-writing campaign on their behalf. On 6 January 2012, a stun grenade thrown by security forces injured al-Mahafda's arm during a protest. On 25 January 2012, al-Mahafdha participated in an open seminar organised by Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition party where he criticized the government on freedom of press, suppression of peaceful protests, blocking opposition websites and delaying visits of international human rights organizations.\\"ŸÖŸäŸÑÿßÿØ: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ±ŸäŸÜŸäŸàŸÜ ŸÖÿµÿ±ŸàŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ≥ŸÑŸÖŸäÿ™ŸáŸÖ ÿ≠ÿ™Ÿâ ŸÜŸäŸÑ ŸÖÿ∑ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸáŸÖ\\".

Relationship with other human rights groups  According to US embassy cables released by WikiLeaks the US ambassador to Bahrain, Adam Ereli, in 2010 noted that human rights organisations including Freedom House and Human Rights Watch relied too much on Rajab and the BCHR for their information on Bahrain. In January 2010, after Freedom House classified Bahrain as \\"not free\\" in its 2010 global survey of political rights and civil liberties, Ereli stated that the BCHR \\"likely had undue influence over the Freedom House researchers, who may not have cast a very wide net during their in-country consultations\\".

Ed Schwartz (May 5, 1946 ‚Äì February 4, 2009) was a Chicago media personality who hosted local late-night radio programs from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. He was nicknamed \\"Chicago Ed.\\" Early life and education A native of the Southeast Side of Chicago, Schwartz' interest in radio began as a youngster with the gift of a portable radio from his grandparents. He fell asleep each night tuned to the Jack Eigen Show on WMAQ (AM). When his part-time high school job took him to the WLS (AM) studios for a delivery, WLS personality Dex Card invited Schwartz to come into the studio and watch him broadcast. The experience made him even more determined to secure a job in radio. Schwartz graduated from Bowen High School, and then attended Columbia College where he studied radio production. Some of Schwartz' classmates included Pat Sajak, Bob Sirott, and Bruce DuMont; he was the first of the group to get a broadcasting job. Schwartz also attended Triton College where he became a certified paramedic. Professional career After working as a gofer at WLS (AM) and WIND (AM), where he was hired as the music librarian, Schwartz became a full- time late-night host at WIND in 1973. Ed Schwartz did not have a voice that was naturally suited for radio. His multiple attempts to win an on-air position at both WLS-AM and WIND had failed, but feeling he had something to offer the public via the airwaves, Schwartz never gave up his hopes. The beginning of his on-air career was something of an accident. A half-hour before airtime, the usual late-night radio personality phoned the station to say he would not be in. WIND had made no arrangements for a replacement because of such short notice. Schwartz was there and was asked to fill in. It soon became his full-time overnight job, as the audience liked his style of honestly speaking his mind and addressing community concerns. During his programs, Schwartz led discussions on local Chicago issues, inviting listeners to call in with their problems so that Schwartz and the listening community could offer some assistance. He frequently telephoned aldermen in the middle of the night to inform them of listener complaints, and he held open forums on racism, poverty, and health care. While still at WIND, Schwartz started a dating service for listeners of his show. There were 22 weddings before management made the decision to close it down because of possible legal issues. Ed Schwartz enlivened late-night radio‚Äîtracking news stories and doing various types of interviews, along with his willingness to use the power of the media to solve listeners' problems. While other late-night radio programs set a tone of quiet entertainment or discussion, Schwartz's shows kept a pace like those done at earlier times of the day. Another regular feature of Schwartz's radio shows was his Chicago History programs. Schwartz' panel of experts would gather at the studio and invite listener questions; stumping the panel meant winning a prize. At the end of these shows, both the panel and the audience learned something about the history of the city. The interviews Schwartz did with local television personalities provided much historic background for a book on Chicago children's television, The Golden Age of Chicago Children's Television. His interviews with Frazier Thomas and Ray Rayner are cited in the book; he is mentioned in the authors' acknowledgments. In 1982, at the suggestion of popular WGN radio host Bob Collins, Schwartz moved his program to the more powerful WGN (AM), where he began his Good Neighbor Food Drive. This event annually raised up to $200,000 while collecting several tons of food; it was the largest one-day food drive in the United States. According to Schwartz, the food drive was initially a response to mayor Jane Byrne's decision to spend several thousand dollars on fireworks while Chicago food pantries were struggling to feed the homeless. Schwartz's generous deeds brought him much attention throughout the Chicago area, and by 1992, his program was reaching nearly 380,000 listeners a week and was considered the top-rated overnight radio show in Chicago. Even though Schwartz was no longer on the air in 1996, WMAQ (AM) played host to the food drive and invited him to preside over it on their airwaves. WBBM-AM has hosted this annual holiday event since 1997. Rival radio personalities, especially those at WLUP, frequently ridiculed Schwartz's upbeat radio program and made light of his battles with obesity. Kevin Matthews, for example, portrayed a character named \\"Ed Zeppelin‚Äù. This character sang parody songs about food and overeating; another was Steve Dahl.Feder, Robert. \\"Late-night voice Eddie Schwartz turns dial, tosses WGN for a \`Loop'\\". Chicago Sun-Times. May 7, 1992. Schwartz rarely acknowledged their barbs, however, and actually accepted an offer to join WLUP in 1992. However, Schwartz failed to attract the same number of listeners he enjoyed while at WGN, due in large part to a constantly changing time-slot, and he parted ways with WLUP in 1995.Feder, Robert. \\"Schwartz, WLUP go separate ways\\". Chicago Sun-Times. May 15, 1995. Afterward, Schwartz became a columnist for Lerner Newspapers, which published neighborhood-specific periodicals throughout the Chicago area. Column Schwartz submitted to Pioneer Press, thinking he still had a job there. A few weeks before his death, Schwartz made his last appearance on radio with host Geoff Pinkus at his old station, WIND.audio file-Geoff Pinkus interviews Ed-early 2009 (Windows Media Player) Health problems and death Schwartz was diagnosed with renal failure in September 2005, not long after he was no longer writing his column. Several radio colleagues began organizing fund- raisers to help pay for his medical treatment. Feder, Robert. \\"For ailing Chicago Ed, money, hope running out\\". Chicago Sun-Times. November 22, 2005. After spending a year in a nursing facility, Schwartz returned home in 2006 and began writing a novel based on his life experiences. However, Schwartz continued to suffer from kidney and heart problems, and died on February 4, 2009, aged 62. He was laid to rest under sunny skies after graveside services at Jewish Waldheim Cemetery in Forest Park.
