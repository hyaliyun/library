Background At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was blockaded within the confines of Port Arthur by the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, the Russian subsidiary naval base at Vladivostok, although shelled by a Japanese squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Dewa Shiget≈ç in March 1904, remained largely undamaged and unblockaded. Located at Vladivostok was a garrison force consisting of the protected cruiser and auxiliary cruiser and a stronger Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron consisting of the armored cruisers Russian cruiser Rossia, , and , under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, pages 395‚Äì397, 412. This small squadron put to sea in the early months of the conflict for commerce raiding operations, and it was the concern of the Imperial Japanese Navy that it might be used either to attack targets on the Japanese mainland, or to coordinate an attack to lift the blockade on Port Arthur. The Japanese were forced to assign the IJN 2nd Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj≈ç with considerable resources in an attempt to locate and destroy it. Attack on Tsushima Strait Russian Vice Admiral Petr Bezobrazov departed Vladivostok on 12 June 1904 with Rossia, Rurik, and Gromoboi under orders to proceed through the eastern Tsushima Channel in the Korean Strait, cruise for two days on known transport routes, and to then double back through the western channel, after which he was to attempt to join his forces to the fleet still blockaded at Port Arthur. On 15 June, he sighted two military transports, Hitachi Maru and Sado Maru en route to Dalny. Hitachi Maru was transporting 1,238 people, including 727 men of the 1st Reserve Regiment of the Imperial Guard of Japan and 359 men from the IJA 10th Division. Sado Maru was transporting 1,258 people, including 867 members of a railway engineering battalion. Both vessels were transporting a large amount of stores, most critically needed were eighteen Armstrong 11-inch (280 mm) siege howitzers, requested by the IJA 3rd Army to attack the Russian fortifications at Port Arthur. Passing in the opposite direction was the smaller Izumi Maru, which was being used as an unarmed, but unmarked hospital ship transporting sick and wounded men from the front back to Japan.Wilmont. The Last Century of Sea Power. Page 94 The only provision the Imperial Japanese Navy had made for protection of its transports was the protected cruiser , which at this time (0715) was stationed approximately mid-channel. Tsushima sighted the Russian squadron in the heavy early morning fog, but was unable to raise a warning due to the short range of its wireless, and poor atmospheric conditions, and attempted to close the distance to Tsushima Island where conditions were better. She was sighted by the Russian squadron, but they did not pursue. Tsushima managed to transmit her warning at 0815 hours, and then headed back towards the Russian squadron. Admiral Kamimura, based at Takeshiki Guard District on Tsushima sent a warning to Shimonoseki to stop all sailing, then ordered his ships to pursue Tsushima. However, at 0900, the Russian squadron sighted Izumi Maru, and Bezobrazov sent Gromoboi to chase her. Gromoboi opened fire, killing or wounding over 30 men, before the Japanese transport stopped and surrendered. About 100 sick and wounded were taken off her, and then she was sunk west of Okinoshima, with those who refused to surrender still aboard. Around 1000, the Russian squadron sighted Sado Maru, and came into sight of the Japanese fleet at about the same time. Despite having just given the Japanese transport 40 minutes to surrender and abandon ship, Rurik fired two torpedoes into Sado Maru, which exploded, killing 239 passengers and crew, but which did not sink the ship. Sado Maru eventually drifted for the next 30 hours until she grounded on Okinoshima. Next, Gromoboi approached Hitachi Maru, which exhibited no sign of intending to surrender. Gromoboi opened fire with all guns, killing many of the men on deck, including her British captain and senior crewmen, and sinking the ship. Due to deteriorating visibility, the Japanese fleet could not close with the Russian squadron, and at 1330 reached the 152 survivors from Hitachi Maru. Aftermath Hitachi Maru Memorial stele at Yasukuni Shrine The Russian squadron continued its operations against shipping on 16 June, when they seized the British steamer Allanton off Maizuru. The cruisers also sank two sailing boats the following day.Matsumura, Masayoshi (2009) Baron Kaneko and the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì05). Lulu.com, p. 144. The attack was a severe blow to Japanese public morale. Memorials were erected in Chidorigafuchi Park in Tokyo, and a mass grave commemorating the Imperial Guards was erected in Aoyama Cemetery. A monument to Sado Maru was built in Shiba Park (and was moved to Yasukuni Shrine in 1964). Kamimura received numerous death threats and came under extreme pressure to track down the Russian squadron, which he did at the Battle off Ulsan on 14 August 1904.

She was requisitioned in 1904 by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War. Background In 1896, following the First Sino-Japanese War, NYK Lines announced an ambitious expansion plan for shipping routes to Europe, which would require up to twelve new vessels. Up until this time, all such vessels had been purchased from overseas sources; however, with the promulgation of the Japanese Shipbuilding Assistance Law in 1896, Mitsubishi was able to secure a contract from NYK for two of these vessels. Previously, the largest vessel constructed by Mitsubishi had been the Suma Maru (1592 tons) for the OSK Lines, so the construction of such a large steel vessel entirely in Japan was unprecedented. Although the company enlisted the support of foreign advisors and used foreign blueprints as a guide, the work took longer than expected, and Mitsubishi eventually was forced to pay compensation to NYK for the cancellation of one of the vessels, and for the delay in delivery of the vessel later named Hitachi Maru.. Hitachi Maru was placed into service with NYK on its European routes for almost six years. In February, 1904, she was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Army to transport men and war materials from Japan to ports in Korea and Manchuria in support of the Russo-Japanese War. While transporting 1,238 people, including 727 men of the 1st Reserve Regiment of the Imperial Guard of Japan and 359 men from the IJA 10th Division and 18 Krupp 11-inch (280 mm) siege howitzers, she was shelled and sunk by the Imperial Russian Navy armored cruiser in the southern Korean Strait between the Japanese mainland and Tsushima in the \\"Hitachi Maru Incident\\".

He was appointed mayor in 1878 after more than 14,000 Austro-Hungarian troops, led by Josip Filipoviƒá, captured Bosnia and Herzegovina from the declining Ottoman Empire. He remained the mayor for the last 14 years of his life. Early life and family Mustafa Fadilpa≈°iƒá was born in Sarajevo with the surname ≈†erifoviƒá in 1830, into one of the most respected and wealthiest families in the city, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mustafa was the son of Fadil- pasha ≈†erifoviƒá, a wealthy landowner, poet, calligrapher and political leader. During Ottoman times, the elder ≈†erifoviƒá was the Pasha of Sarajevo. Fadilpa≈°iƒá had a brother named Mahmud. Their brother-in-law was the Travnik dissident ≈†erif-beg Hafizadiƒá. It is believed that they were descended from ≈†erif Ahmed who migrated to Sarajevo around 1750 from the Kefe Eyalet and it is alleged that he himself was a descendant of the prophet Muhammad Fadilpa≈°iƒá was raised and educated in the Ottoman capital city Constantinople. He also lived in Egypt before returning to Sarajevo in 1860. Upon his return to Sarajevo, he married Nuri Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá, a woman who was known as the largest single landowner in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and niece of military leader Husein Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá. His father died aged 80 on 26 November 1882 in Istanbul, having migrated there when the Habsburg regime took over Bosnia in 1878. He was buried in √úsk√ºdar. Fadilpa≈°iƒá's paternal grandparents were Mustafa Nurudin, who was killed in January 1827, just prior to the Bosnian uprising, and ƒÜamila Fazlagiƒá (died 1848). First Mayor of Sarajevo During the summer of 1878, the Austro-Hungarian army, led by Josip Filipoviƒá, began invading Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although met with resistance by the Ottoman Bosnian army, led by their commander Smail Haki-beg Selmanoviƒá, the Austro-Hungarians quickly captured the entire region, which had been a part of the weakening Ottoman Empire. Immediately after the arrival of the Austro-Hungarian government, Fadilpa≈°iƒá was appointed the first Mayor of Sarajevo, a position which was originally housed in a building on the left bank of the Miljacka, and later in Bistrik, one of the oldest settlements in the city. During his governance, Sarajevo underwent noticeable positive changes and Sarajevans were particularly fond of their first mayor. He enacted the first regulatory plan of Sarajevo, which provided protection and revitalization for the historic bazaar Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija. In 1880 he implemented the first wagonettes in Sarajevo. Five years later, he had horse-drawn trams installed. For the first time in six centuries, in 1881, he reinstated the Catholic Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Pope Leo XIII named Josip ≈†tadler the first archbishop of Sarajevo. Around that same time, he commissioned the building of, what is today known as, the Building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was designed by Josip Vanca≈°. Fadilpa≈°iƒá also commissioned the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sacred Heart Cathedral, a Sharia law school, a grammar school and multiple hamams. Fadilpa≈°iƒá, his father and his brother became the most politically influential Sarajevans near the end of the 19th century. Death Having spent the final 14 years of his life as the mayor of Sarajevo, Fadilpa≈°iƒá died on 6 December 1892 at the Vakus Hospital in Sarajevo, where he had been transported after a fit of nausea. He was buried in the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque.

The bill invests more resources into English language learner programs and creates 5,000 new pre-K and full day kindergarten slots for at risk youth. He also sponsored a bill to provide every school in Colorado with an analysis of where opportunity gaps exist in order to ensure that all students are being challenged. 2013 Legislative Session Buckner sponsored a bill to help under and unemployed adults obtain technical education certificates to increase math literacy and help those participating in the program re-enter the workforce. Elections *2012 To challenge incumbent Republican Representative Cindy Acree for the District 40 seat, Buckner was unopposed for the June 26, 2012 Democratic Primary, winning with 2,130 votes, and won the November 6, 2012 General election with 20,163 votes (57.2%) against Representative Acree.

During this period the group purchased their own ships and started operation worldwide. In 1997, after acquiring a floating dock and a shipyard in Istanbul‚Äôs Tuzla shipyard region, the group extended their scope of work to ship repair, maintenance, overhaul and ship docking. Success in repairing and docking of around 50 to 70 ships per year brought rapid development to Tersan Group into the new ship building sector very soon. In 2001 Tersan Group established their ship building yard in the same region of Tuzla/Istanbul but separately from the repair yard. The first new building project was successfully delivered in 2002 which is followed by a number of challenging new building projects until 2008. The limited areas in Tuzla/Istanbul region and the capacities of the current yard no longer met with Tersan‚Äôs future targets for building huge Offshore and Handymax commercial vessels, consequently Tersan decided to invest in a new yard in Yalova City with much more capacities and still benefitting from easy access to Istanbul. The repair yard remaining in Tuzla/Istanbul, Tersan‚Äôs ship building division moved to Yalova in 2008. The new facilities in Yalova is today one of the biggest and most modern shipyards in Europe. Besides the initial investment the development of the yard is going on continuously meeting upcoming technologies and demanding new building projects.

As the title indicates, the painting represents a woman holding a fan. She is shown in half-length sitting on what appears to be a green bench. She is wearing an elaborate gown with a Polka dot pattern consisting of an array of blue-filled circles, and holds in her right hand a folded fan. The left hand of the woman holds a paper that bares the artists signature (lower left). She wears a hat with feathers or plumes of fashionable dressed Parisian women.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, exhibition catalogue: Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art She is placed in an outdoor setting with buildings, windows and green shutters in the 'background'. The work is similar stylistically with another work exhibited at the same Salon d'Automne, Dancer in a caf√© (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo New York). Le Salon Bourgeois, designed by Andr√© Mare inside La Maison Cubiste, in the decorative arts section of the Salon d'Automne, 1912, Paris. Metzinger's Femme √† l'√âventail is hanging on the wall to the left; reflected in the mirror, Fernand L√©ger's Le passage √† niveau (The Level Crossing), 1912. Towards the center-left is a portrait of a woman by Marie Laurencin As in other works by Metzinger of the same period, there are elements to be found of the real world, e.g., a fan, windows, and feathers. The rest of the canvas consists of a series of geometric forms of greater or lesser abstraction, of convex and concave gradations that stem from the teachings of Georges Seurat and Paul C√©zanne. The Divisionist brushwork, mosaic-like 'cubes', present in Metzinger's Neo- Impressionist phase (circa 1903 through 1907) have returned giving texture and rhythm to vast areas of the canvas, visible both in the figures and background.Art of the 20th Century, Louis Vauxcelles, 1907, describes the brushwork of Delaunay and Metzinger as mosaic-like 'cubes' Femme √† l'√âventail portrays a strikingly fashionable woman at the height of Parisian fashion in 1912. The artist depicts the figure and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the scene simultaneously. This can be seen in the deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of chiaroscuro, of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing. > \\"The style of the clothes is meticulously up-to-the-minute\\" writes > Cottington of Metzinger's three entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, \\"the > cut of the dresses, and the relatively uncorseted silhouettes they permitted > their weavers to display, owe much more to Poiret than to Worth‚Äîindeed the > check of one figure in the Dancer and the polka dots of the Woman with a Fan > anticipate the post-war geometries, if not the colour harmonies, of Sonia > Delaunay's fabrics, while the open-collared sportiness of the dress and > cloche-style hat in The Yellow Feather look forward to the 1920s.\\"David > Cottington, 2004, Cubism and its Histories, Manchester University Press Multiple perspective Danseuse au caf√© (Dancer in a caf√©), oil on canvas, 146.1 x 114.3 cm, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York. Published in Au Salon d'Automne \\"Les Ind√©pendants\\" 1912, Exhibited at the 1912 Salon d'Automne The reflexive function of complex geometry, juxtaposed multiple perspectives, planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types. Though very subtle, there does manifest itself in Femme √† l'√âventail a spatial depth or perspective reminiscent of the optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, windows appear of varying dimension depending on distance from the observer. This shows that non-Euclidean geometry does not imply the destruction of classical perspective, or that the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. Unlike the flattening of space associated with the Cubist paintings of Picasso and Braque of the same period, Metzinger had no intention of abolishing depth of field. Of course here perspectival space is only alluded to by changes of scale, not by co-ordinated linear convergence, resulting in a complex space perfectly adapted to a stage-set. This feature is observed not only in Metzinger's Cubist paintings, but also in his Divisionist and proto- Cubist works between 1905 and 1909, as well as in his more figurative works of the 1920s (during the Return to order phase).Christopher Green, Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 52, 53Helmholtz on Space and Painting, Michael Heidelberger, University of T√ºbingen. Translation from Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) lectures, 1871-1873 on Optisches √ºber Malerei (On the Relation of Optics to Painting), publ. 1876 The painting, as Metzinger's enchanting Dancer in a caf√©, inscribes an ambivalence in that it expresses both contemporary and classical, modern and traditional, avant-garde and academic connotations, simultaneously. The \\"busy geometry of planar fragmentation and juxtaposed perspectives has a more than reflexive function,\\" notes Cottington, \\"for the symmetrical patterning of its reticulations (as in the dancer's d√©colletage) and their rhythmic parallel repetitions suggest not only movement and diagrams but also, metonymically, the mechanised object- world of modernity.\\" \\"The works of Jean Metzinger\\" Guillaume Apollinaire writes in 1912 \\"have purity. His meditations take on beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach sublimity. The new structures he is composing are stripped of everything that was known before him.\\"Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, The Cubist Painters, translated, with commentary by Peter F. Read, 2002 Apollinaire, possibly with the work of Eadweard Muybridge in mind, wrote a year later of this state of motion present in the Cubist paintings of Metzinger and others, as akin to cinematic movement around an object, revealing a plastic truth compatible with reality by showing the spectator \\"all its facets.\\" Albert Gleizes in 1911 remarks Metzinger is \\"haunted by the desire to inscribe a total image\\": :He will put down the greatest number of possible planes: to purely objective truth he wishes to add a new truth, born from what his intelligence permits him to know. Thus‚Äîand he said himself: to space he will join time. [...] he wishes to develop the visual field by multiplying it, to inscribe them all in the space of the same canvas: it is then that the cube will play a role, for Metzinger will utilize this means to reestablish the equilibrium that these audacious inscriptions will have momentarily broken. (Gleizes) Now liberated from the one-to-one relationship between a fixed coordinate in space captured at a single moment in time assumed by classical vanishing-point perspective, the artist became free to explore notions of simultaneity, whereby several positions in space captured at successive time intervals could be depicted within the bounds of a single painting.Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2001Linda Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and NonEuclidean geometry in Modern Art, 1983 This picture plane, write Metzinger and Gleizes (in Du \\"Cubisme\\", 1912), \\"reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces.\\" The forms situated within this space, they continue, \\"spring from a dynamism which we profess to command. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensibility.\\"Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, Du \\"Cubisme\\", Paris, 1912, in Robert L. Herbert, Modern Artists on Art, Englewood Cliffs, 1964. There are two methods of regarding the division of the canvas, according to Metzinger and Gleizes, (1) \\"all the parts are connected by a rhythmic convention\\", giving the painting a centre from which the gradations of colour proceed (or towards which they tend), creating spaces of maximum or minimum intensity. (2) \\"The spectator, himself free to establish unity, may apprehend all the elements in the order assigned to them by creative intuition, the properties of each portion must be left independent, and the plastic continuum must be broken into a thousand surprises of light and shade.\\" > \\"There is nothing real outside ourselves; there is nothing real except the > coincidence of a sensation and an individual mental direction. Far be it > from us to throw any doubts upon the existence of the objects which strike > our senses; but, rationally speaking, we can only have certitude with regard > to the images which they produce in the mind.\\" (Metzinger and Gleizes, 1912) According to the founders of Cubist theory, objects possess no absolute or essential form. \\"There are as many images of an object as there are eyes which look at it; there are as many essential images of it as there are minds which comprehend it.\\" Theoretical underpinnings The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points is treated in Du \\"Cubisme\\" (1912). It was also a central idea of Jean Metzinger's Note sur la Peinture, 1910; Indeed, prior to Cubism painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. And it was Metzinger for the first time in Note sur la peinture who enunciated the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. It was then that Metzinger discarded traditional perspective and granted himself the liberty of moving around objects. This is the concept of \\"mobile perspective\\" that would tend towards the representation of the \\"total image.\\" Though at first the idea would shock the general public some eventually came to accept it, as they came to accept the 'atomist' representation of the universe as a multitude of dots consisting of primary colors. Just as each color is modified by its relation to adjacent colors within the context of Neo-Impressionist color theory, so too the object is modified by the geometric forms adjacent to it within the context of Cubism. The concept of 'mobile perspective' is essentially an extension of a similar principle stated in Paul Signac's D'Eug√®ne Delacroix au n√©o- impressionisme, with respect to color. Only now, the idea is extended to deal with questions of form within the context of both space and time.Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York Salon d'Automne, 1912 The Salon d'Automne of 1912, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November. Metzinger's Danseuse is exhibited second to the right. Other works are shown by Joseph Csaky, Franti≈°ek Kupka, Francis Picabia, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Le Fauconnier. The Salon d'Automne of 1912, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November, saw the Cubists (listed below) regrouped into the same room XI. The history of the Salon d'Automne is marked by two important dates: 1905, bore witness to the birth of Fauvism (with the participation of Metzinger), and 1912, the xenophobe and anti-modernist quarrel. The 1912 polemic leveled against both the French and non-French avant-garde artists originated in Salle XI where the Cubists exhibited their works. The resistance to foreigners (dubbed \\"apaches\\") and avant-garde artists was just the visible face of a more profound crises: that of defining modern French art, and the dwindling of an artistic system crystallized around the heritage of Impressionism centered in Paris. Burgeoning was a new avant-garde system, the international logic of which‚Äîmercantile and m√©diatique‚Äîput into question the modern ideology elaborated upon since the late 19th century. What had begun as a question of aesthetics quickly turned political, and as in the 1905 Salon d'Automne, with his infamous \\"Donatello chez les fauves\\",Louis Vauxcelles, Le Salon d'Automne, Gil Blas, 17 October 1905. Screen 5 and 6. Gallica, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, the critic Louis Vauxcelles (Les Arts, 1912) was most implicated in the deliberations. Recall too, it was Vauxcelles who, on the occasion of the 1910 Salon des Ind√©pendants, wrote disparagingly of 'pallid cubes' with reference to the paintings of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, L√©ger and Delaunay.Louis Vauxcelles, A travers les salons: promenades aux ¬´ Ind√©pendants ¬ª, Gil Blas, 18 March 1910 On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the Chambre des d√©put√©s (and was debated at the Assembl√©e Nationale in Paris).Journal officiel de la R√©publique fran√ßaise.

La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, or Projet d'H√¥tel, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, and a bedroom, and a living room‚Äîthe Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Gleizes, Laurencin, L√©ger and Metzinger's Woman with a Fan were hung. It was an example of L'art d√©coratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the Fa√ßade architecturale, designed by Duchamp- Villon.La Maison Cubiste, 1912 \\"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\\", writes Christopher Green, \\"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers and Mare's old friends L√©ger and Roger La Fresnaye\\".Christopher Green, Art in France: 1900-1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000 Reviewing the Salon d'Automne Roger Allard commended Metzinger's 'finesse and distinction of palette'.

For 5 years, Rowland practiced law in Memphis, then moved to Coffeeville, Mississippi and set up a law office. He often submitted historical articles for publication in the Commercial Appeal, Atlanta Constitution, and Mississippi Historical Society.Galloway, Patricia. 2006.

Retrieved 2014-01-10 Career In 1902, Dunbar Rowland became the first director of the newly created Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH). In the early years of his tenure, Rowland concentrated on collecting Confederate records to preserve and commemorate the sacrifice of Mississippi soldiers during the American Civil War. In 1906, Rowland married Eron Opha Moore Gregory, who would become an eminent historian in her own right. As Director of the State archives, Dunbar Rowland created a written History of Mississippi in two volumes, published in 1907: * Dunbar Rowland (ed). 1907. Encyclopedia of Mississippi History: comprising sketches of counties, towns, events, institutions and persons (Volume I) * Dunbar Rowland (ed). 1907. Encyclopedia of Mississippi History: comprising sketches of counties, towns, events, institutions and persons (Volume II) Rowland traveled to Europe where he visited established archives in England, France and Spain, and obtained copies of historical records pertaining to territorial Mississippi. For the Mississippi archives, Rowland rejected the library-style arrangement of the state‚Äôs records and instead developed his own system that resulted in a chronological arrangement of documents for each department of government. In archiving Confederate history in Mississippi, Rowland compiled and edited a ten-volume collection of Jefferson Davis documents, that he published in 1923: *Jefferson Davis, Constitutionalist: his Letters, Papers, and Speeches During the 1920s, Rowland organized the first archeological survey in Mississippi to collect Native American relics and perform excavations of mounds in the state to locate artifacts for preservation in the archives. In 1925, Rowland compiled and published two additional volumes on Mississippi history that contained biographical accounts of the state‚Äôs businessmen and politicians: *History of Mississippi: The Heart of the South Along with other state historians, Rowland used his position in state government to lobby the Mississippi congressional delegations to create the National Archives in Washington D.C., which came to fruition in 1934. Rowland was so involved in the process, that he applied to become the first director of the National Archives but was unsuccessful. In addition to the establishment of private and public archives during his tenure at MDAH, Rowland was able to initiate the creation of a museum and a library, plus assemble literary and artistic collections that were representative of Mississippi history and culture.

The simplest case in Euclidean geometry is the intersection of two distinct lines, which either is one point or does not exist if the lines are parallel. The red dot represents the point at which the two lines intersect. Determination of the intersection of flats ‚Äì linear geometric objects embedded in a higher-dimensional space ‚Äì is a simple task of linear algebra, namely the solution of a system of linear equations. In general the determination of an intersection leads to non-linear equations, which can be solved numerically, for example using Newton iteration. Intersection problems between a line and a conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, etc.) or a quadric (sphere, cylinder, hyperboloid, etc.) lead to quadratic equations that can be easily solved. Intersections between quadrics lead to quartic equations that can be solved algebraically.  On a plane = Two lines = For the determination of the intersection point of two non-parallel lines a_1x+b_1y=c_1, \\\\ a_2x+b_2y=c_2 one gets, from Cramer's rule or by substituting out a variable, the coordinates of the intersection point (x_s,y_s) : : x_s=\\\\frac{c_1b_2-c_2b_1}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1} , \\\\quad y_s=\\\\frac{a_1c_2-a_2c_1}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1}. \\\\ (If a_1b_2-a_2b_1=0 the lines are parallel and these formulas cannot be used because they involve dividing by 0.) = Two line segments = Intersection of two line segments For two non- parallel line segments (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2) and (x_3,y_3),(x_4,y_4) there is not necessarily an intersection point (see diagram), because the intersection point (x_0,y_0) of the corresponding lines need not to be contained in the line segments. In order to check the situation one uses parametric representations of the lines: : (x(s),y(s))=(x_1+s(x_2-x_1),y_1+s(y_2-y_1)), : (x(t),y(t))=(x_3+t(x_4-x_3),y_3+t(y_4-y_3)). The line segments intersect only in a common point (x_0,y_0) of the corresponding lines if the corresponding parameters s_0,t_0 fulfill the condition 0\\\\le s_0,t_0 \\\\le 1 . The parametrs s_0,t_0 are the solution of the linear system : s(x_2-x_1)-t(x_4-x_3)=x_3-x_1, : s(y_2-y_1)-t(y_4-y_3)=y_3-y_1 \\\\ . It can be solved for s and t using Cramer's rule (see above). If the condition 0\\\\le s_0,t_0 \\\\le 1 is fulfilled one inserts s_0 or t_0 into the corresponding parametric representation and gets the intersection point (x_0,y_0). Example: For the line segments (1,1),(3,2) and (1,4),(2,-1) one gets the linear system : 2s-t=0 :s+5t=3 and s_0=\\\\tfrac{3}{11}, t_0=\\\\tfrac{6}{11}. That means: the lines intersect at point (\\\\tfrac{17}{11},\\\\tfrac{14}{11}). Remark: Considering lines, instead of segments, determined by pairs of points, each condition 0\\\\le s_0,t_0 \\\\le 1 can be dropped and the method yields the intersection point of the lines (see above). Line‚Äìcircle intersection = A line and a circle = For the intersection of *line ax+by=c and circle x^2+y^2=r^2 one solves the line equation for or and substitutes it into the equation of the circle and gets for the solution (using the formula of a quadratic equation) (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2) with :x_{1/2}= \\\\frac{ac\\\\pm b\\\\sqrt{r^2(a^2+b^2)-c^2}}{a^2+b^2} \\\\ , :y_{1/2}= \\\\frac{bc\\\\mp a\\\\sqrt{r^2(a^2+b^2)-c^2}}{a^2+b^2} \\\\ , if r^2(a^2+b^2)-c^2\\\\ge0 \\\\ . If this condition holds with strict inequality, there are two intersection points; in this case the line is called a secant line of the circle, and the line segment connecting the intersection points is called a chord of the circle. If r^2(a^2+b^2)-c^2=0 holds, there exists only one intersection point and the line is tangent to the circle. If the weak inequality does not hold, the line does not intersect the circle. If the circle's midpoint is not the origin, see.Erich Hartmann: Geometry and Algorithms for COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN. Lecture notes, Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, October 2003, p. 17 The intersection of a line and a parabola or hyperbola may be treated analogously. = Two circles = The determination of the intersection points of two circles * (x-x_1)^2+(y-y_1)^2=r_1^2 ,\\\\ \\\\quad (x-x_2)^2+(y-y_2)^2=r_2^2 can be reduced to the previous case of intersecting a line and a circle. By subtraction of the two given equations one gets the line equation: :2(x_2-x_1)x+2(y_2-y_1)y=r_1^2-x_1^2-y_1^2-r_2^2+x_2^2+y_2^2. This special line is the radical line of the two circles. Intersection of two circles with centers on the x-axis, their radical line is dark red Special case \\\\;x_1=y_1=y_2=0 : In this case the origin is the center of the first circle and the second center lies on the x-axis (s. diagram). The equation of the radical line simplifies to \\\\;2x_2x=r_1^2-r_2^2+x_2^2\\\\; and the points of intersection can be written as (x_0,\\\\pm y_0) with :x_0=\\\\frac{r_1^2-r_2^2+x_2^2}{2x_2},\\\\quad y_0 =\\\\sqrt{r_1^2-x_0^2}\\\\ . In case of r_1^2 the circles have no points in common. In case of r_1^2=x_0^2 the circles have one point in common and the radical line is a common tangent. Any general case as written above can be transformed by a shift and a rotation into the special case. The intersection of two disks (the interiors of the two circles) forms a shape called a lens. circle‚Äìellipse intersection = Two conic sections = The problem of intersection of an ellipse/hyperbola/parabola with another conic section leads to a system of quadratic equations, which can be solved in special cases easily by elimination of one coordinate. Special properties of conic sections may be used to obtain a solution. In general the intersection points can be determined by solving the equation by a Newton iteration. If a) both conics are given implicitly (by an equation) a 2-dimensional Newton iteration b) one implicitly and the other parametrically given a 1-dimensional Newton iteration is necessary. See next section. = Two smooth curves = A transversal intersection of two curves touching intersection (left), touching (right) Two curves in \\\\R^2 (two-dimensional space), which are continuously differentiable (i.e. there is no sharp bend), have an intersection point, if they have a point of the plane in common and have at this point : a: different tangent lines (transversal intersection), or : b: the tangent line in common and they are crossing each other (touching intersection, see diagram). If both the curves have a point and the tangent line there in common but do not cross each other, they are just touching at point . Because touching intersections appear rarely and are difficult to deal with, the following considerations omit this case. In any case below all necessary differential conditions are presupposed. The determination of intersection points always leads to one or two non-linear equations which can be solved by Newton iteration. A list of the appearing cases follows: intersection of a parametric curve and an implicit curve intersection of two implicit curves *If both curves are explicitly given: y=f_1(x), \\\\ y=f_2(x), equating them yields the equation :: f_1(x)=f_2(x) \\\\ . *If both curves are parametrically given: C_1: (x_1(t),y_1(t)), \\\\ C_2: (x_2(s),y_2(s)). : Equating them yields two equations in two variables: :: x_1(t)=x_2(s), \\\\ y_1(t)=y_2(s) \\\\ . *If one curve is parametrically and the other implicitly given: C_1: (x_1(t),y_1(t)), \\\\ C_2: f(x,y)=0. :This is the simplest case besides the explicit case. One has to insert the parametric representation of C_1 into the equation f(x,y)=0 of curve C_2 and one gets the equation: ::f(x_1(t),y_2(t))=0 \\\\ . *If both curves are implicitly given: C_1: f_1(x,y)=0, \\\\ C_2: f_2(x,y)=0. : Here, an intersection point is a solution of the system ::f_1(x,y)=0, \\\\ f_2(x,y)=0 \\\\ . Any Newton iteration needs convenient starting values, which can be derived by a visualization of both the curves. A parametrically or explicitly given curve can easily be visualized, because to any parameter or respectively it is easy to calculate the corresponding point. For implicitly given curves this task is not as easy. In this case one has to determine a curve point with help of starting values and an iteration.

For polygons with many segments this method is rather time-consuming. In practice one accelerates the intersection algorithm by using window tests. In this case one divides the polygons into small sub- polygons and determines the smallest window (rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes) for any sub-polygon. Before starting the time-consuming determination of the intersection point of two line segments any pair of windows is tested for common points.

Lecture notes, TU Darmstadt, 1997, p. 79 (PDF; 3,4 MB)  In space (three dimensions)  In 3-dimensional space there are intersection points (common points) between curves and surfaces. In the following sections we consider transversal intersection only. = A line and a plane = Line‚Äìplane intersection The intersection of a line and a plane in general position in three dimensions is a point. Commonly a line in space is represented parametrically (x(t),y(t),z(t)) and a plane by an equation ax+by+cz=d. Inserting the parameter representation into the equation yields the linear equation :ax(t)+by(t)+cz(t)=d\\\\ , for parameter t_0 of the intersection point (x(t_0),y(t_0),z(t_0)). If the linear equation has no solution, the line either lies on the plane or is parallel to it. = Three planes = If a line is defined by two intersecting planes \\\\varepsilon_i: \\\\ \\\\vec n_i\\\\cdot\\\\vec x=d_i, \\\\ i=1,2 and should be intersected by a third plane \\\\varepsilon_3: \\\\ \\\\vec n_3\\\\cdot\\\\vec x=d_3 , the common intersection point of the three planes has to be evaluated. Three planes \\\\varepsilon_i: \\\\ \\\\vec n_i\\\\cdot\\\\vec x=d_i, \\\\ i=1,2,3 with linear independent normal vectors \\\\vec n_1,\\\\vec n_2, \\\\vec n_3 have the intersection point : \\\\vec p_0=\\\\frac{d_1(\\\\vec n_2\\\\times \\\\vec n_3) +d_2(\\\\vec n_3\\\\times \\\\vec n_1) + d_3(\\\\vec n_1\\\\times \\\\vec n_2)}{\\\\vec n_1\\\\cdot(\\\\vec n_2\\\\times \\\\vec n_3)} \\\\ . For the proof one should establish \\\\vec n_i\\\\cdot\\\\vec p_0=d_i, \\\\ i=1,2,3 , using the rules of a scalar triple product. If the scalar triple product equals to 0, then planes either do not have the triple intersection or it is a line (or a plane, if all three planes are the same). = A curve and a surface = intersection of curve (t,t^2,t^3) with surface x^4+y^4+z^4=1 Analogously to the plane case the following cases lead to non-linear systems, which can be solved using a 1- or 3-dimensional Newton iteration.Erich Hartmann: Geometry and Algorithms for COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN. Lecture notes, Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, October 2003, p. 93 *parametric curve C: (x(t),y(t),z(t)) and :parametric surface S: (x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))\\\\ , *parametric curve C: (x(t),y(t),z(t)) and :implicit surface S: f(x,y,z)=0\\\\ . Example: :parametric curve C: (t,t^2,t^3) and :implicit surface S: x^4+y^4+z^4-1=0 (s. picture). :The intersection points are: (‚àí0.8587, 0.7374, ‚àí0.6332), (0.8587, 0.7374, 0.6332). A line‚Äìsphere intersection is a simple special case. Like the case of a line and a plane, the intersection of a curve and a surface in general position consists of discrete points, but a curve may be partly or totally contained in a surface. = A line and a polyhedron  Two surfaces = Two transversally intersecting surfaces give an intersection curve. The most simple case the intersection line of two non-parallel planes.  See also  * Computational geometry * Equation of a line  References Further reading * Nicholas M.

McCain, along with fellow North Carolina A&T; State University students Ezell Blair Jr., Joseph McNeil and David Richmond, staged a sit-in protest at the Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, on February 1, 1960 after they were refused service due to the color of their skin. Their actions were credited with launching the Greensboro sit-ins, a massive protest across state lines involving mostly students who took a stand against discrimination in restaurants and stores by refusing to leave when service was denied to them. The sit-ins successfully brought about the reversal of Woolworth's policy of racial segregation in their southern stores, and increased national sentiment to the fight of African-Americans in the south. Early life, education and protest McCain was born in Union County, North Carolina, on January 3, 1941. He attended James B. Dudley High School in Greensboro for one year where he initially met his soon-to-be partner in the Greensboro Sit-ins, Ezell Blair Jr.,Franklin McCain. (2014).

McCain graduated from Eastern High School in Washington D.C. in 1959. In the fall of 1959, McCain enrolled at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. During McCain's freshman year, he lived in a dormitory with David Richmond and resided in the same building as Ezell Blair Jr. and Joseph McNeil. During this time, the four men became extremely close friends. They would frequently gather in one of their dorms to have deep conversations, usually about racial inequalities in America. The conversations would go on for so long, that it was common for the men to fall asleep right where they sat chatting. McCain said that they \\"finally felt hypocritical\\" for doing nothing along with many in the country, and they decided it was time to take a stance. McCain weighed over 200 pounds and towered over his comrades at 6'2\\". Despite his intimidating build, he was regarded as quiet, and wasn't on any athletic teams in school, as he instead preferred the close companionship of his friends. McCain and his three friends devised a plan to sit down at the white only counter in a store, and not to leave until they were served. McCain later said that five and dime stores would often put ads on TV encouraging everyone to shop in their store, but once black people got there, they were treated as unwelcome guests. He said that it really \\"added insult to injury\\" and so the men thought this would be a good place to start their protest. Ultimately, it was McCain who gave the final call as his friends began to get cold feet about the situation. Quiet McCain is remembered for having said, \\"Are you guys chicken or not?\\" Moments later the four men were out the door, on the way to accomplish their mission. In February of 1960, the four men refused to leave Woolworth's, one of the world's largest retailers, after they were denied service. McCain later said, \\"I felt that this could be the last day of my life\\" but that, \\"we had absolutely no choice.\\" Bilyeu, S. (2010). 1960: Sitting Down to Take a Stand. New York Times Upfront, 142(8), 24. Despite being scared, the men stood their ground. McCain compared the men to \\"Mack trucks\\" because there was simply no way anyone could move them from their seats. The longer the men sat, the more McCain realized that no one was stopping them. He later said that he thought to himself \\"Maybe they can't do anything to us, maybe we can keep it up.\\" Ten days later, the protest had spread to fifteen cities in five different states. 1972\\\\.

She is best known for her roles as first Director of the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industryhttp://larson.library.emory.edu/marbl/DigProjects/swh/subjects/The%20Southern%20Summer%20School%20for%20Women%20Workers%20in%20Industry.htm and as a co-founder of the Affiliated Schools for Workers (later known as the American Labor Education Service), though she also had a long career in government service supporting education for underserved groups including women, labor workers, and the elderly. Early life and education Worthington Smith was born in 1888 in New York City. Her father's invention of a steamheating system, which heated many of the early office buildings of New York, provided the family with a handsome fortune. She attended Bryn Mawr College between 1906 and 1910 for her undergraduate degree, during which she was elected to lead the student body as president of the Self Government Association. Worthington Smith remained at Bryn Mawr the following year and left in 1911 with a master's degree in ethics and psychology, after which she received a second graduate degree from the New York School of Philanthropy (which exists currently as the Columbia University School of Social Work). When she was twenty-five years old she returned to Bryn Mawr at the invitation of President of the College, M. Carey Thomas, to oversee a residence hall as a Warden, and began to teach an informal class on social work at the request of a group of undergraduates in which she introduced the concepts of child welfare, family rehabilitation, delinquency, immigration, and housing. She returned to her studies at the School of Philanthropy in 1914 and soon established a community center for youth in New York City that served many boys of Irish, Italian, and African American descent, which she ran until M. Carey Thomas offered her the position of Acting Dean in 1919. In the two years that she served as Dean, her interest in workers' educationThe Story of Philosophy was already becoming an area of active pursuit: in addition to her duties mentoring undergraduate students and administering college programs, Smith took the initiative to arrange night classes for the black college gardeners and service employees.http://www.ego2heart.org/heartsease/history.html  The Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry  A pivotal moment in Worthington Smith's career came in 1921, when President Thomas asked her to head the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry,Phamplet for the School http://larson.library.emory.edu/marbl/DigProjects/swh/images/Barker%20528/0528-086.pdf a brand new initiative that Thomas envisioned and set into motion after visiting Workers' Educational Association programs in England.Workers' Education Bureau of America Though Thomas was the original visionary of the school, Worthington Smith is credited with developing it into the immensely successful program that it became and setting the example for a host of other similar programs that were founded in its image, including the Wisconsin Summer School, Barnard Summer School, Vineyard Shore School, Southern Summer School, and the coeducational Hudson Shore Labor School. The Summer School was a residential program on the campus of Bryn Mawr College that operated for 8 weeks in the summer every year (except for 1935) between 1921 and 1938, hosting and educating female factory workers from all over the country who numbered approximately 1700 over the duration of the initiative. Money was raised for scholarships to support the students, who were between the ages of 18 and 35 and came from diverse backgrounds including different nationalities, races, religions, industries, non-unionized and union affiliations. About 100 women attended each year that the school operated, gathering to live, eat, and sleep together while they studied a variety of liberal arts subjects with distinguished faculty drawn from local institutions. The object of the school, as stated in prospectus and distributed to a variety of news outlets, was \\"to offer young women of character and ability a fuller education and an opportunity to study liberal subjects in order that they might widen their influence in the industrial world, help in the coming social reconstruction and increase the happiness and usefulness of their own lives.\\" The focus was therefore on giving women the knowledge and tools to exercise agency in their lives, and to become leaders in their communities in a new era of social change.http://brynmawrcollections.org/greenfield/exhibits/show/the-summer- school-for-women-wo/introduction/hilda-worthington-smith In 1933 Harry Hopkins, as adviser to FDR and head of the FERA, borrowed Ms. Smith to set up an educational program for the Administration, which in 1937 became the W.P.A.'s Workers Education Service. As FDR's Educational Specialist, She created and ran multiple programs; one such program employed out-of-work teachers, whose graduates include Hubert H. Humphrey, a future vice president under LBJ. Another set up the She-She-She Camps for unemployed women, ER's bid to place women in the program of Civilian Conservation Corps camps for men, and to provide education and housing for unemployed youth.  Later career and life  The workers' education movement gained momentum, with Worthington Smith playing an active and significant role. In addition to the schools that she was directly involved in founding (such as the Hudson Shore Labor School, which was established on the site of her family home on the Hudson River),http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/daybyday/event/august-1939-18/ she served on the advisory committees of many such initiatives. She also established and served as first Director of the Affiliated Schools for Workers (1927‚Äì1939), later known as the American Labor Education Service (1939‚Äì1962). The later years of Worthington Smith's career were dominated by federal appointments, listed here: *Specialist in Workers' Education for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, 1933‚Äì1943 *Director of the Workers' Service Program for the Works Progress Administration 1939‚Äì1943 *Consultant in Labor Education, 1943 *Federal Public Housing Authority as Chief of the Project Services Section 1943‚Äì1945 *Chairman of the National Committee for the Extension of Labor Education 1945‚Äì1951 *Member of the New York State Adult Education Bureau (1957 to 1959) *Consultant for the Connecticut State Commission for Services to Elderly Persons from 1959 to 1961. *Consultant for the Training Division of the Community Action Program of the Office of Economic Opportunity, 1965 Worthington Smith retired at the age of 83 to focus on various writing projects related to her life experiences and career, including a narrative of her seven years with the Office of Economic Opportunity and a revised and expanded version of her autobiography, Opening Vistas in Workers' Education, which was self-published in 1978. In addition to these publications, Worthington Smith's poetry was published in songbooks, periodicals, and in three printed volumes: Castle of Dream (1910) and Poems (1964), both privately printed, and Selected Poems (1977). She died on March 3, 1984.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/14/obituaries/hilda-w- smith-95-educator.html Life philosophy To sum up Jane's life a story done in 1984 for the New York Times does come close to sewing 1919 to 1983 into a fine embroidery. The author noted that in 1937 the programs Smith initiated but couldn't in 1933 call by name became the W.P.A.'s Workers Education Service. When tasked by Harry Hopkins to be education specialist she already knew what she wanted. Smith also wanted to teach \\"workers‚Äô education\\", a term that had a strong communist association.

It achieved notoriety for a fire which occurred in May 1961 in which 19 people perished. The club The club was located on Crown Street in Bolton and was on the top floors of an old mill warehouse building. From the street front, the building had three floors but the warehouse was built on a slope so the rear had eight floors looking out on to the River Croal which at this point ran in a brick-lined channel. The club was opened in December 1960 by Stanley Wilcock, who rented the building, using the lower floors for his business, making kitchen furniture. In March 1961, Wilcock sold his interest in the nightclub which occupied the top two floors of the warehouse to two Manchester businessmen; Denis Wilson and Richard Sorrensen. Wilcock retained the lower floors for his furniture business. The club was small with just a few tables where customers could sit and listen or dance to tape-recorded music. The maximum occupancy was about 200. The owners of the building learnt of the nightclub's availability from an advertisement in the Bolton Evening News and were concerned the building would be unsuitable for such use. On 1 May 1961 at 10.35pm, one of the owners, Norman Balshaw went to the club and told Wilson and Sorrensen that the club was not to be continued, and they must vacate by 24 June.Details of Coroner‚Äôs Inquest, 30 January 1961 - June 13, 1961, Folder ABZ/73/1, Bolton Archive The fire On the night of the fire, the club was quiet with it being a Monday. Between 20 and 25 people were in the club. At 11pm, less than half an hour after the visit by the owner, the manager Bill Bohannon smelt smoke. He went down the single wooden staircase, which was the only means of access and egress. Upon arriving at the ground floor, he saw smoke coming under the door leading to the furniture workshop. He kicked the door down and was confronted with a raging inferno. The intensity of the fire prevented him returning upstairs, but he managed to escape. This inferno quickly spread up the stairs towards the club. As there was no other means of escape, some customers took to jumping from the windows. The windows available were those at the back, where there was an eight-floor drop onto bricks by the river channel.Bolton Evening News, May 2, 1961 Bolton Fire Brigade arrived within three minutes, but were unable to enter due to the intense fire. It was not possible to access the back with ladders, due to the river, and the turntable ladder was not long enough to bridge the river to reach the upper floors. Bolton were backed up by fire engines from Leigh, Horwich (Lancashire County Fire Brigade) and Bury (Bury Fire Brigade). The blaze took 2.5 hours to bring under control and allow the firemen to bridge the burnt staircase with their ladders gaining access to the top floors.Bolton News, 20 June 2001 The scene was, as one fireman said, ‚Äúhorrific,‚Äù with 14 people dead in the club. Of those in the club at the time of the fire, the manager Bill Bohannon escaped, 14 died in the club, five died from jump injuries and two, maybe three, jumped and survived. The number is not clear due to difficulty in accessing the river channel and a comment that someone who had jumped was seen running away. Police Constable Brian White said he only saw three jump from the building.Glasgow Herald, June 14, 1961 There were 11 men and eight women killed in the tragedy. Denis Wilson and Richard Sorrensen, the owners, and Sheila Bohannon, wife of the manager were among those who perished in the fire.Details of Coroner‚Äôs Inquest, Folder ABZ/73/3, 2 May 1961 ‚Äì 25 November 1968, Bolton Archive Inquest At the inquest, ex-club owner Stanley Wilcock gave evidence of there being a door behind the bar. This was an inward opening loading bay door, which would have given access to the outside front of the building and a drop of 2 floors, but the fitting of a false dance floor in the club prevented it from opening. It was disclosed the door could be opened but it needed to be lifted over the false floor for it to open, something customers in their panic had never thought about. If this door had been opened all victims would probably have escaped. It was established that the blaze was so intense due to the highly flammable solvents and paints used in the furniture workshop. The cause of death was given as smoke inhalation. The fire never fully reached the top floor but the hot gases and smoke soon filled the whole building. Despite an investigation by the Police and Fire Brigade, no actual cause for the fire could be given and the Coroner recorded an open verdict. Aftermath Following the fire, there was an outcry, and questions were asked in Parliament. The records of the questions and answers are held in the National Archives in Kew.National Archives, Kew, ref HO 346/10National Archives Kew, Public Records, original department reference FIR (1960) 8/707/4-8 The result was a change in the Licensing Act, namely the Licensing Act 1961, which required Fire Brigades to inspect clubs and requirements on owners to provide adequate exits and fire extinguishers. A new act, the Licensing Act 1964, also required all clubs to be inspected and a licence issued before they could open. This was later incorporated into the Fire Precautions Act 1971 giving Fire Brigades powers to close sub-standard night clubs. In 2006 the Fire Precautions Act was withdrawn and following subsequent changes to the Licensing Act, Fire Services no longer have a duty to inspect clubs, although they retain a power to close premises if and when they are brought to their attention. Notes Bill Bohannon, the manager of the club, who survived the fire, having suffered 20 per cent burns, died aged 84 in November 2013.

Vranic was recognized by a number of national and international awards for his research contributions, mentoring and administration including the Orders of Canada (Officer) and Ontario. Personal life and education Vranic was born in 1930 to Vladimir Vranic and Ana Vranic in Zagreb, Croatia. His Jewish father converted to Christianity in 1920, and his mother converted upon marriage, but they were both non-observant. His father was a professor at the Faculty of Economics, Engineering, and Sciences, and Dean at the School of Economics and Engineering at the University of Zagreb. His mother ran a beauty salon in Zagreb. Vranic's immediate family escaped from the Holocaust due to the Italians' humane treatment of Jews. After the collapse of Italy, his family escaped with a partisan boat to Vis, an island governed by Allied Forces and Croatian partisans, and then on a British military ship to Taranto, Italy, which was already under supervision by the Allied Forces. During the last year of the war, his father joined the partisans. After the war, his family returned to Zagreb where Vranic completed high school, medical school (1955) and received a D.Sc in Physiology at the University of Zagreb in 1962. Vranic was invited to be the last post-doctoral fellow of Charles Best, a co- discoverer of insulin. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1965, associate professor in 1968 and full professor in 1972 at the University of Toronto Department of Physiology. Vranic was chair of the Department of Physiology from 1991 to 1995. In 1978 he was cross-appointed to professor in the Faculty of Medicine. In 1976-1977 he was an invited professor at the University of Geneva during a sabbatical leave and a visiting research fellow of Merton College at the University of Oxford. From 1973-1978 he was appointed a member of the Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Engineering at the University of Toronto. He was an adjunct professor at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm and at the University of Zagreb, Croatia. Vranic is also a member of the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the Department of Medicine and a fellow at the Senior Scholar's College at the University of Toronto. His wife, Magda Vranic, was an assistant professor in rehabilitation medicine at the University of Toronto. She died of breast cancer at the age of 50. Together, they had two daughters. Vranic died on June 18, 2019 in Toronto, Canada of congestive heart failure.The Globe and Mail, July 18, 2019 Research Vranic's research accomplishments reflect the supervision of a large number of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, and wide collaboration with basic and clinical researchers who were crucial for interaction between basic science, molecular and cell biology, and clinical research. He has 214 peer-reviewed publications and is recognized for his research contributions in the following areas: =Tracer methodology= The treatment of diabetes concentrates on the liver and/or the periphery. Vranic quantified hormonal and metabolic interactions involved in the physiology and pathogenesis of diabetes by developing tracer methods to separate the effects of diabetes on both. A large amount of his research accomplishments are due to measurement of non-steady state glucose kinetics. He collaborated in the first clinical tracer studies on insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and the Cori cycle. =Extrapancreatic glucagon= Diabetes reflects insulin deficiency and glucagon abundance. Vranic discovered extrapancreatic glucagon in dogs, which changed the prevailing dogma and permitted precise exploration of the roles of insulin and glucagon in physiology and diabetes, and provided conclusive evidence about the role of glucagon in diabetes. Before his research, glucagon was considered to have effects on many organs, but he was the first to measure the physiological role of glucagon, based on the effect of glucagon on glucose turnover. In contrast to prevailing beliefs, he was the first to indicate that glucagon only acts on the liver. He was also the first to quantify the physiological secretion of insulin. =Glucose metabolism= Vranic was the first to establish the critical role of glucagon-insulin interaction and the control of glucose metabolism during moderate exercise and of catecholamines during strenuous exercise. He quantified the deficiencies in the release and effects of these hormones in diabetes. He also revealed how acute and chronic hyperglycemia affects the expression of GLUT2 gene and protein in diabetes. =Exercise and stress= Vranic pioneered new concepts of the role of exercise in diabetes, leading to precise methods of controlling insulin, allowing type 1 diabetics to participate in the Olympics and clinicians to recommend exercise and healthy eating habits to prevent type 2 diabetes. He outlined molecular and physiological mechanisms whereby exercise training and adaptation to repetitive neurogenic stress can prevent diabetes in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats. =Indirect effect of insulin= Vranic and others established that the indirect effect of insulin plays an important role in the regulation of glucose production in dogs. They confirmed this effect in humans and its role in type 2 diabetes. =Mechanisms whereby the liver and muscle are protected against hypoglycemia= Vranic showed that because the muscle and the liver are protected against changes in glucose levels, these organs do not have diabetic complications. =Prevention of hypoglycemia= Vranic described the molecular mechanisms responsible for increased HPA axis in diabetes and for the diminished responses of HPA axis, catecholamines and glucagon to hypoglycemia. He proposed a new approach to decrease the threat of hypoglycemia by blocking the effect of somatostatin. Vranic's research accomplishments and his main collaborators are summarized in a career retrospective entitled: \\"Odyssey between Scylla and Charybdis through storms of carbohydrate metabolism and diabetes: a career retrospective.

Index  Academic Studies  He started studying painting and sculpture in 1976 at the National School of Fine Arts in Argentina, specializing in fileteado porte√±o (Buenos Aires‚Äô fileteado style) with filete master teacher Le√≥n Untroib. He also studied diverse international popular arts and ornamental styles, and since 1989 started conducting extensive research in art styles in Italy, Spain, France, England, United States, Mexico, Russia and China.  Tango and fileteado  Tango and fileteado are closely related, therefore Muscia participated in several projects where both art forms intersected; he was also a pioneer in integrating the fileteado art into areas in which this type of art had not been seen before. Due to his commendable contribution to Buenos Aires's popular arts, he was appointed Head Professor at the Academia Nacional del Tango de la Rep√∫blica Argentina [Argentina's National Tango Academy], position which he has continuously held since 1990.  Teaching and publications  In 1995 Muscia publishes \\"El Filete Porte√±o, Arte Popular de Buenos Aires\\", [The filete porte√±o: Popular Buenos Aires Art ] Spanish-English Edition. This was the first fileteado instruction book published and it was launched simultaneously in Argentina and in The US. This book was sponsored by the Fondo Nacional de las Artes [National Arts Fund] and by the National Tango Academy of the Argentine Republic, and it was declared by the Buenos Aires City Council as a book of cultural relevance. (Regulation 49.554. 1995). Since the 1980s and to this date, Muscia has held seminars, conferences, lectures, demonstrations, exhibits, and has appeared in newspaper articles and TV segments with the purpose of promoting the fileteado art in Argentina and the world. Since 1995 he has been a professor at the Liceo Superior del Tango [Superior Tango Academy] in the course \\"El Tango y las artes pl√°sticas\\" [Tango and Plastic Arts].  In the art field  He has presented individual and collective exhibits in Argentina. Since 1984 and sponsored by the Chancellorship of Argentina, he has exhibited his work in art galleries and cultural centers in Europe ‚ÄìLondon, Berlin, Barcelona, Toulouse, among others, and in Mexico and The US, fact which according to critics has helped to legitimize the fileteado as a means of artistic expression. He has received several awards, including a Scholarship of the Fundacion Antorchas for Artistic Creativity (1992) for his Project T√≥tems Porte√±os (Resignificaci√≥n del Obelisco de Buenos Aires).

He is the founder of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, the state's third-largest political party, and ran as the Moderate candidate for Governor of Rhode Island in the 2010 election. While leader of the Moderate Party, Block was an advocate for economic, educational, and political reforms in Rhode Island. His court battle to gain official state recognition for the Moderates in 2009 overturned several unconstitutional laws and made it easier for third parties to gain signatures and access election ballots. In a highly contested four-way election, Block received 6.5% of the vote in the Governor's Race. Block emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of the Rhode Island General Assembly in the aftermath of the 2010 elections. He publicly opposed the controversial $75 million loan and subsequent taxpayer bailout of 38 Studios, the taxpayer-funded redevelopment the Superman Building, and introduction of the Sakonnet River Bridge toll. Block has also called for the elimination of the \\"master lever\\" from election ballots which he argues creates voter disenfranchisement and unfairly benefits larger political parties. He eventually created MasterLever.org to explain his position and enable the public to contact state officials via e-mail. As a small business owner, Block has run several software companies which have worked with state governments to identify fraud and government waste in social service and welfare programs. In 1995, Block was able to save the state of Texas over $1 billion by developing a new statewide debit card system. Shortly after the 2010 election, Block offered his company's help free of charge to find waste and fraud in Rhode Island's entitlement programs. He was subsequently involved in the state's Medicare waste and fraud report as well as assisting the Providence Police Department's fraud unit to better access state records in late 2012. Police investigators have claimed that the new computer software will help detect millions of dollars in fraud. He also served as president of RI Taxpayers, a taxpayer advocacy and watchdog group, until his resignation in May 2013 when he announced his candidacy for governor in the 2014 election. In October 2013, Block announced that he had joined the Rhode Island Republican Party and intended to challenge Cranston Mayor Allan Fung in the upcoming Republican primary. He based his campaign on a plan to save Rhode Island taxpayers $1 billion by eliminating wasteful spending.  Early life  Kenneth J. Block was born and raised in Milford, Connecticut. The oldest of three children, Block's family lived in the same house as his grandparents. He graduated from Milford High School in 1983 and then attended Dartmouth College where he earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer science four years later. Block began his career writing software for Wall Street trading desks during the late 1980s. He was employed by the Bank of New England and worked at small software consultancy firms Dalcomp Corporation and LOBB Systems. In 1991, Block moved to Rhode Island to work for the Providence-based GTECH Corporation. Although initially a one-year consultancy, he stayed with the company for another six years. From 1995 to 1999, Block was president of Kinetic Consulting, Inc., a software consultation firm that worked with state agencies to identify government waste and abuse as well as improving the overall efficiency of their spending programs, until the dot-com bust forced him to close the company. In 2001, Block founded Simpatico Software Systems, a data mining service used by government agencies and private businesses to track waste and fraud. Additionally, it supplies software services to the SNAP program. Similar to his first company, Simpatico Systems also provided engineering and consulting services. Its clients have included the EVERTEC and GTECH Corporations, Northrop Grumman, and the state government of Texas. In Texas, Block's company developed a statewide debit card system for food stamp and welfare recipients that saved the state more than $1 billion. Two years later he created a second company, Cross Alert Systems, which manufactures \\"intelligent\\" traffic systems for recreational trail and public road intersections.  Political career  In 2007, Block decided to enter the Rhode Island political scene. In later interviews, Block said that he entered politics out of frustration with the state government's inability to solve Rhode Island's declining economy and education system. He was particularly concerned that his children were not getting a quality education in public schools and, like many young Rhode Islanders, would eventually have to leave the state due to high unemployment rate. He also noted the difficulty for small business owners to operate in the state and that the high tax rate forced many companies to relocate to Massachusetts and elsewhere. As a longtime business owner himself, Block believed many of these problems could easily be fixed though basic fiscal responsibility and \\"common sense\\" leadership. Disillusioned with both the Democratic and Republican parties, who he felt were more concerned battling over social issues, Block believed that starting a centrist-based third-party would be the best option. His political affiliation is unknown before 2007, however, Block has stated his admiration for former RI Governor Bruce Sundlun. A Brown University political poll reported that 74% of Rhode Islanders were dissatisfied with the state's political leadership and \\"would be supportive of a new moderate political party\\". A poll run by Block produced similar numbers. He reasoned that if his party could attract enough moderate voters, they would be able to put pressure on then Republican Governor Donald L. Carcieri and the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to address vital issues being neglected by the state. The Moderate Party of Rhode Island was founded by Block a year later. An official website was launched in early-2008 and several candidates were endorsed in the general election - Jean Ann Guiliano (D), John Pagliarini (R), Matt McHugh (I), and Christopher Little (I). On October 23, 2008, Block co-hosted Operation Clean Government's State of the State with former RI attorney general Arlene Violet interviewing all four candidates. Gaining official recognition by the state was \\"a fight and a half\\" according to Block. In February 2009, Block and American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the state to gain official party status. U.S. District Judge William Smith, striking down several ballot access laws as unconstitutional, ruled in the Moderate Party's favor three months later. The Moderate Party were able to collect over 34,000 signatures, the 12th highest number of signatures in the country, to qualify as a political party and were placed on the 2010 ballot. Afterwards, Block said that Rhode Island was the most difficult state to start a political party. The Moderate Party would find support from a number of prominent figures including former Hasbro CEO Alan G. Hassenfeld, Arlene Violet, and former U.S. Attorney Robert Clark Corrente, the latter briefly serving as party chairman.  2010 election  Block was the Moderate Party's candidate for Governor during the 2010 election. He had not intended to run for office, however, Block reluctantly stepped in failing to find a suitable candidate in time. Block had developed an interest in civics and government while at Dartmouth College in the 1980s though he had no political experience prior to the campaign. He was successful in gaining the necessary signatures 1,000 registered voters to get on the ballot. His door-to-door campaigning in South Kingstown was included in a feature story for Rhode Island Monthly. Block was one of the candidates profiled on Fox Providence's The Rhode Show for its \\"Coffee with the Candidates\\" segment. Block finished fourth in the statewide general election with 22,146 votes garnering 6.5% of the vote. He followed Democrat Frank Caprio with 78,896 votes (23%), Republican John Robitaille with 114,911 votes (33.6%), and the winner Independent Lincoln Chafee with 123,571 votes (36.1%). Though an impressive performance for a first-time candidate Block was blamed for his part in the four-way race that allowed Chafee to win the election. The Republican Party of Rhode Island was particularly critical of Block for splitting the race as their candidate, John Robitaille, lost to Chafee by less than 4% of the vote.  Post-election  Block continued his political activism as leader of the Moderate Party stressing the need for economic, educational, and governmental reforms. He made several guest appearances on Rhode Island PBS's public affairs television program A Lively Experiment and Operation Clean Government's State of the State. He began a movement to abolish the \\"master lever\\" and worked with the state to uncover fraud and waste in the state's welfare programs going so far as to offering his company's services to Governor Chafee at no charge. In January 2013, Block began teaching a technology and business class as an adjunct professor at the University of Rhode Island. An outspoken critic of the Rhode Island General Assembly, he challenged a number of controversial decisions made by the legislative body. While running for Governor, Block criticized the state's $75 million loan to 38 Studios, in exchange for the video game company moving its headquarters from Maynard, Massachusetts to Providence, Rhode Island, suggesting that the money would be better spent investing in local businesses. He was also strongly opposed to taxpayer-funded redevelopment of the Superman Building and the introduction of the Sakonnet River Bridge toll. Block called this most recent legislation by the assembly an \\"awful decision\\" and condemned the Rhode Island Democratic Party as \\"[proving] itself completely incapable of governing the state.\\" = Combating fraud and government waste = Shortly after the 2010 election, Democratic State Representative Lisa Baldelli Hunt urged Governor Lincoln Chafee to contact Block about working with state agencies to uncover fraud in Rhode Island's Medicaid programs. In April 2011, Block volunteered his company's services free of charge to help the state identify waste and fraud in Health and Human Services spending. He was not able to testify in person before the House and Senate Finance Committee that month, however, a written statement was submitted into the record. Two months later, Block talked with both the Department of Human Services and the Department of Labor and Training about using his company's services free of charge. After several months negotiating with the Chafee administration, Block announced on WPRO's The John DePetro Show that his company was close to reaching an agreement to start working with state agencies to investigate waste and abuse in Rhode Island's welfare system. Block's company, Simpatico Software Systems, began working with the Providence Police Department's fraud unit in late 2012. Simpatico Systems developed a computer program so that fraud investigators can more easily access state records. The unit's two investigators, Jack Costa and Daniel Murphy, had previously been dependent on more than a dozen other agencies throughout the state and records were often unavailable in the current system. The Simpatico system specifically assisted the Providence Housing Authority in sharing data with the state government. Their efforts were featured on the November 6th edition of WPRI's Eyewitness News. It was claimed that the new computer software would help investigators detect millions of dollars in fraud. He was later involved in the Rhode Island Health and Human Services Waste and Fraud Report which submitted its preliminary findings in early 2013. = Ban the Master Lever initiative = Another reform pushed by Block was the elimination of straight-ticket or \\"master lever\\" voting, which allows voters to cast a ballot for all candidates of a single political party with one vote, arguing that it confuses and disenfranchises voters. The master lever was first introduced to Rhode Island in 1939 when voting machines required voters to physically pull multiple levers to cast a vote. These machines were eventually replaced with a modern electronic system in the late 1990s, however, the laws remained in place. Block was among those who testified before the Rhode Island Senate in a judiciary hearing on the elimination of the master lever in March 2012. A later study conducted by the Moderate Party, which examined ballots from the 2010 election in Burrillville, Rhode Island, indicated that voters did not understand how to use the master lever. Voters that chose to vote for all Democratic candidates would often cancel out their votes when continuing to cast individual votes further down in the ballot. Block cited the Moderate Party's campaign in the November 2012 election as an example with, he said, over 9,000 Rhode Island voters using the Moderate Party master lever mechanism despite not having a Moderate candidate on the ballot. Politifact judged this claim as 'mostly true\\" saying that there were slightly under 9,000 such votes. Another issue caused by the master lever, critics argue, is \\"under voting\\" at the local level, where many offices are officially non-partisan, with candidates being skipped on the ballot because they do not belong to a political party. The master lever also created an unfair advantage for majority political parties at the expense of minority and third parties. Both Allan Fung and Scott Avedisian, Republican mayors of Cranston and Warwick respectively, agreed with this view; a ballot recount by Fung in his 2006 election revealed serious irregularities in votes cast by the master lever. In U.S. presidential elections, many voters unknowingly elect candidates simply by voting for a presidential nominee. An estimated 46,000 voters used the master lever during the 2010 gubernatorial elections, a number which doubled during the 2012 U.S. presidential election, giving local Democrats a huge advantage over non-Democratic candidates. In January 2013, Block launched MasterLever.org to inform the public about the problems using the obsolete voting system in local and state elections. The website allowed supporters to send an automated letter to state officials including House Speaker Gordon Fox, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, and Governor Lincoln Chafee. Within a week of its launch, 500 people had sent letters via the website in support the banning the master lever. That number rose to 2,600 within four months. Although the majority of the General Assembly remained silent on the issue, Block's initiative eventually gained support from key political figures including Democratic Secretary of State Ralph Mollis and Governor Chafee. Block polled legislators at the State House for their stance on the master lever which he then made available on the website. A ban on the master lever was also supported by RI-based government watchdog groups Common Cause, Operation Clean Government, and the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition. Block made a second appearance on the April 5th edition of A Lively Experiment where he talked about his views on the master lever, payday loans, and state tax credits. Block's report on waste and fraud in Rhode Island's state social service programs was also a topic of discussion on the show. = Involvement with RI Taxpayers = On February 4, 2013, Block succeeded Harriet Lloyd as president of the taxpayer advocacy group RI Taxpayers (formerly known as the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition). The decision was discussed a week later on A Lively Experiment; one of the guest panelists, columnist Donna Perry, was the executive director of RI Taxpayers. As president of the organization, Block was an active public speaker and made numerous appearances before state committee hearings. On March 13, 2013, he testified before RI House Judiciary Committee on behalf of both the Moderate Party and RI Taxpayers urging the members to pass legislation for eliminating \\"master lever\\" voting in the state. At the RI Taxpayers' annual meeting on May 11, Block issued a formal challenge to the General Assembly to \\"stop stalling\\" on economic-related legislation for businesses and taxpayers before adjourning next month. At another meeting, Block called for more citizen involvement in local government and warned that voter apathy, especially among people under 40, would continue to result in poor legislation and a lack of accountability by political leadership. He also spoke about the importance of economic reforms and the need to improve the state's business climate. After a four-month term, Block resigned his position with RI Taxpayers to run in the 2014 elections.  2014 election  On May 21, 2013, Block announced he would once again run for office as Governor of Rhode Island in the 2014 election. Weeks later, political operative Jeff Britt joined the Moderate Party as Block's campaign manager. Britt was previously a political ally of Democratic House Speaker Gordon Fox and former Republican governor Don Carcieri. His campaign was endorsed by blogger and third-party activist Dennis Mikolay praising him as a government watchdog. One of his last public appearances as a Moderate candidate took place at Roger Williams University on September 30, 2013.  Switch to the Republican Party  On October 28, 2013, Block officially announced at a Barrington town hall meeting that he would be joining the Republican Party with the intention of running as its candidate for the 2014 gubernatorial election. The news was not totally unexpected as Block, who had been largely funding the Moderate Party with his own finances, including his 2010 campaign, held a poll on his chances running as a Moderate or Republican candidate over the summer. A Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions poll indicated only 9% of participants would vote for Block as a Moderate candidate. Three months earlier, Block suggested that he would be open to running as a Republican during a WPRO interview with Buddy Cianci. He had also been courted by Republican Joe Trillo to join the party partially to prevent another four-way race which allowed then independent candidate Lincoln Chafee to win the 2010 election. John DePetro called Block's decision a \\"smart political move\\" and speculated on the upcoming GOP primary between Block and Republican party favorite Cranston mayor Allan Fung. The news was also discussed on A Lively Experiment with guest panelists Dave Layman, WPRO/WPRI legal analyst Louis Pulner, Brown University political science professor Wendy Schiller, and Arlene Violet. Block declared his intention to run as the party's nominee in a letter to 20,000 Republican voters and based his campaign on an ambitious plan to save the state $1 billion in government waste over a four-year period. He further explained that this amount could easily be achieved by focusing on \\"off budget\\" spending such as public sector retiree healthcare, temporary disability, and unemployment insurance. Block offered the state's Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) program as an example. Cutting the annual costs in half for the TDI program, which is twice as much to run as New Jersey, would save $80 million alone. Block outlined his plan on his official website in addition to other forums as well. In November 2013, he was invited to write a column for The Providence Journal to make his case for saving the state $1 billion by eliminating government waste. Block was also interviewed by Tim White and Ted Nesi on the November 15th edition of WPRI's Eyewitness News and further explained his plan to save the state $1 billion. That same month, PolitiFact.com rated a claim by Block that Rhode Island has the most expensive unemployment system in the country as \\"false\\". According to the \\"2014 State Business Tax Climate Index\\", published by the Tax Foundation, Rhode Island ranked 46 out of the 50 states. In the report, Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system was rated the worst in the country, however, that alone did not indicate it was the most expensive. Block‚Äôs policy director, Matthew Schweich, defended the statement pointing out that Rhode Island was ranked near the bottom in almost every category and argued that the cumulative effect supports their claim. Block responded to the website in a letter to the editor of The Providence Journal acknowledging the error \\"but choosing the wrong words and intentionally misleading voters are different types of mistakes\\". In December 2013, longtime Rhode Island GOP fundraiser Tony Bucci resigned his slot on Fung's campaign committee to join Ken Block's gubernatorial campaign as a senior adviser and finance chairman.  Personal life  Block lives in Barrington, Rhode Island with his wife Jennifer, a middle school science teacher, and their two children.

One of key party politicians, Jos√© Sanchez Marco, took Nocedal‚Äôs place ‚Äì virtually ensured success by means of a broad electoral alliance ‚Äì in the prestigious Navarrese Pamplona district, vacating in turn his own place as an Integrist candidate in the rural Gipuzkoan district of Azpeitia; Senante became his replacement though total alien to Basque political milieu he got safely elected, as Azpeitia, a profoundly religious, conservative rural district, had been usually electing Traditionalist candidates.some authors claim that Senante and other Carlist candidates owed their success in Azpeitia to Jesuit propaganda of the local Loyola sanctuary, see Jos√© Luis Orella Mart√≠nez, El origen del primer catolicismo social espa√±ol [PhD thesis at Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia], Madrid 2012, p. 114 The 1907 triumph turned out to be the start of a fairly long parliamentary career, lasting for the next 16 years. Senante stood as an Integrist candidate from the same Azpeitia district in course of the following 7 election campaigns of 1910, 1914, 1916, 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1923, always emerging victorious. The mainstream Carlists usually refrained from fielding counter-candidates, though at times other parties presented their contenders; twice (in 1918 and 1920) Senante was declared triumphant having faced no competition and elected according to the notorious Article 29.for 1918 see here, for 1920 see here During 3 terms until 1916 he was one of two Integrist MPs in the Cortes; during 5 terms after that date Senante was the sole party deputy in the parliament.see the list of Integrist deputies; the Integrist leader, Juan Olaz√°bal, preferred to stay out of Cortes and pursued his career in the regional Vascongadas politics As representative of Integrism Senante was perhaps the most Right-wing, reactionary and anti- democratic deputy of the entire Cortes; even other ultraconservative MPs, the mainstream Carlists, were to a small extent prepared to demonstrate some flexibility. Senante governed his actions by the principle of defending the sacrosanct Catholic religion, which marked the most visible thread of his activity: defending rights and privileges of the Church against secularization, usually promoted by the Liberals. He sided with the hierarchy both in case of nationwide disasters like Semana Tr√°gica, the event he interpreted mostly in religious terms,Ramon Corts i Blay, La setmana tr√†gica de 1909: l'arxiu secret Vatic√†, Barcelona 2009, , pp. 211-2 and minor though publicity-gaining controversies, like a dispute over possible sale abroad of an antique Zamora pyxis, possessed by the Church.the Zamora cathedral possessed an ancient pyxis from the Caliphate period and intended to sell to a private antiquities dealer, triggering public debate about the piece possibly being taken out of Spain; Canalejas spoke in favor of restrictions, while Senante argued that the Church was free to handle the antique the way they liked, see J.I. Mart√≠n Benito, F. Regueras Grande, El Bote de Zamora: historia y patrimonio, [in:] De Arte 2 (2003), pp. 216-7, 221 Senante speaking, 1922 Having developed adopted Vascongadas allegiances,Senante entered Academy of Basque Studies and spoke in favor of bilingualism, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta, Manuel Senante Mart√≠nez Senante turned out to be supporter of separate local establishments,supported Solidaridad Alicantina in 1907, Paniagua, Piqueras 2008, p. 521 active in the extra-parliamentary commission on regional autonomy organized in 1918taking turns with Manuel Chalbaud Err√°zquin, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta, Manuel Senante Mart√≠nez and publishing related works.author of a 1919 theoretical work on municipal autonomy in a regional legal ambience; he referred to ‚Äúnuestras provincias Vascongadas‚Äù and spoke against municipal autonomy, considered absurd, see here In general, he tended to vote with the Conservative Party against the Liberals, though at the later stages, especially after the assassination of Jos√© Canalejas, he even sided with the Liberals against the growing anarchist and socialist tide. At times he represented Integrism in broad Catholic electoral alliances, formed under the auspices of the primate.like Junta Electoral Central in 1914, Crist√≥bal Robles Mu√±oz, Jesuitas e Iglesia Vasca.

He kept steering the Alicantine daily when the death of Ram√≥n Nocedal vacated the chairmanship of El Siglo Futuro. The daily, set up in 1875 by Candid√≥ Nocedal, remained a second-rate newspaper in terms of circulation and impact on the Spanish national market, but for ultraconservative politics it emerged as an iconic voice and a point of reference. It is not clear how the process of appointing a new editor-in-chief was managed,At the time of Nocedal's death the junta administrativa of El Siglo Futuro was composed of Javier Sanz Larumbe, Ildefonso Alonso de Prado, D. Adaucto, and Timoteo San Mill√°n, El Siglo Futuro 22.04.35, available here who the counter-candidates considered were, and what the key selection factors were.Apart from Senante, the obvious candidate must have been the party leader Juan Olazabal, at that time editing a local Gipuzkoan daily La Constancia; it is possible that another one was Rafael Rotll√°n, who soon afterward left El Siglo Futuro to head El Debate, Orella Mart√≠nez 2012, p. 67 Following an eight-month vacancy, in November 1907 it was Senante who appointed the new director.See El Siglo Futuro 06.11.07, available here El Siglo Futuro remained under Senante's leadership for the next 29 years and was probably his lifetime achievement. For three decades Senante was its strategic director, editor and manager, setting the political line rather than contributing himself.Key writers were the regular staff of Luis Ortiz y Estrada, Emilio Munoz (Fabio), Juan Mar√≠n del Campo (Chafarote) and Felipe Robles Delgano; guest writers included important Traditionalist politicians like Conde Rodezno, Jos√© Lamami√© or Manuel Fal Cond√© Madrid-based, the daily was better positioned to trace national politics and influence decision makers than mainstream Carlist dailies, especially the Barcelona-based El Correo Catal√°n, the Sevilla-based La Uni√≥n and the Pamplona-based El Pensamiento Navarro. Its readership base remained stable, composed mostly of lower parish clergy and Traditionalist activists. Though under Senante the paper underwent modernization with the introduction of graphics and expansion into economic, culture and sport sections, over time ‚Äì especially in the 1920s and later ‚Äì the circulation distance between El Siglo Futuro and leading national newspapers broadened into an abyss.The circulation of El Siglo Futuro was 5,000, compared to 200,000 of the monarchist ABC and 80,000 of the Catholic El Debate El Siglo Futuro In terms of ideological outlook Senante followed the Nocedals closely; El Siglo Futuro remained an ultraconservative, vehemently anti-liberal and then anti-democratic vehicle of pursuing traditional values centered on the Catholic faith. Its principal objective was defense of religion and position of the Church; its primary foe was liberalism, later to be paired with democracy and socialism. In terms of party politics the paper remained the tribune of Integrism and was perhaps its most visible emanation in the Spanish public realm;El Siglo Futuro opposed militantly secular liberalism of the late Restauraci√≥n, cautiously endorsed Catalan and Basque rights if framed in the traditional fueros, sympathized with the Central Powers in course of the First World War, despised the emerging anarchist and socialist Left, cheered the Primo de Rivera dictatorship to be disillusioned later, had few regrets about the fallen monarchy of Alfonso XIII but was almost explicitly hostile towards the Republic, welcomed the rise of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, to turn against the latter following the assassination of Dolfuss even following amalgamation within Carlism in the early 1930s El Siglo Futuro cherished its Integrist identity. In terms of its style and language El Siglo Futuro was a fairly typical Spanish party paper, excelling in bombastic, hyperbolic, inflammatory, intransigent, sectarian phraseology. The paper led a venomous campaign against the Jews and freemasonry,For a review see Isabel Martin Sanchez, La campa√±a antimas√≥nica en El Siglo Futuro: la propaganda anujud√≠a durante la Segunda Rep√∫blica, [in:] Historia y Comunicaci√≥n Social 4 (1999), pp. 73-87. In a single sentence the daily accused the Jews of serving both Marxism and plutocracy, denouncing ‚Äúfrente √∫nico o com√∫n revolucionario judeomarxista y mas√≥nico, animado por una sola y tuisma alma, los banqueros jud√≠os de Wall Street‚Äù (p. 80); for the newspaper, Judaism and freemasonry represented anti-Spain (pp 78-80), anti-Catholicism (pp 80-83) and Satanism (81). Another author claims that El Siglo Futuro, consumed by traditional Spanish anti-British obsession, viewed freemasonry as sort of a secret service managed by London, Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 1975, , p. 180; for other anti-British threads, see here. Mart√≠n Sanchez claims that El Siglo Futuro contributed to buildup of the later Francoist ‚Äúcrusade‚Äù propaganda by engineering anti-masonic, anti-Jewish and anti-communist mobilisation (p 87), and facilitated pro-Axis leaning by lambasting the League of Nations as steered by the Jews (84), praising Hitler and Mussolini for confronting Judaism (p. 77).

A variety of means are available to achieve the effect. For further information about the use of tremolo in music, including notation, see Tremolo. History The first self-standing electronic tremolo effects unit may have been produced by DeArmond, in which a motor shakes a canister containing a \\"hydro-fluid\\" (not mercury as some people assume), oscillating the canister containing an electrolytic fluid that sends the signal to ground. Earliest references to DeArmond's tremolo unit date to 1941.Presto Music Times, August 1941 Starting in the 1950s many companies began incorporating the effect into guitar amplifiers, including the Fender Tremolux and Vibrolux: Leo Fender marked the effect on Fender amplifiers as \\"vibrato\\", conversely calling the vibrato arm on his Fender Stratocaster a tremolo arm. The most notable early amplifiers with built-in tremolo functions were the 1961 Fender Princeton and the Gibson Falcon. In such amplifiers, the tremolo circuit was relatively simple, using as little as a dozen components and one half of a tube of the preamp circuit. The effect was achieved through \\"bias wiggle\\", in which the bias of a tube, in the preamp or output stage, was modulated (turned off and on, or partly off and on) in a pure sine wave. Such circuits typically had controls for speed and depth, and produced an effect described as \\"lush, warm, and roundly pulsing\\". Later amplifiers, and particularly the Fender Blackface amps of the mid 1960s and the later Silverface amps, used a much more complex circuit, producing the kind of effect that was especially popular with surf musicians. Modulation was produced using an optocoupler, a light- dependent resistor whose pulsating signal (producing a lopsided wave) affects the preamp circuit.

History and ministry Maldonado is the co-founder and Sr. Pastor of King Jesus Ministry (El Rey Jes√∫s). In an interview conducted by Publishers Weekly, Maldonado stated that Christ appeared before him during intense prayer and audibly spoke to him saying, \\"I have called you to bring my supernatural power to this generation.\\" He started a church with twelve members in 1996. He has written over 50 books and manuals which many of them have been translated into Spanish, English, Portuguese, Italian, and French. Maldonado also preaches what he sees as the message of Jesus and his redemptive power on Maldonado's international television program The Supernatural Now, which is aired on TBN, Daystar, and The Church Channel. As of May 22, 2013, his ministry, along with other of his affiliated daughter churches, have a combined membership of 20,000 congregants. Maldonado teaches that Christian believers need to use the power of God to demonstrate that God is active in the world today just as he was during the time of the primitive church. He believes that without the supernatural power of God, it is impossible to truly know God and receive His blessings of healing, wealth, deliverance, among others in our life. His teachings also focus on establishing what he calls the Kingdom of God. He explains that the Kingdom of God is not a physical place, but a network of thoughts, lifestyle, principles, laws and fundamentals that govern the entire universe. Maldonado is married to Ministry partner Ana Maldonado. He currently resides in Miami, Florida, with his wife and their two sons Bryan and Ronald. In September, 20th, 2020, however, Maldonado announced that his wife Ana had filed for divorce. http://www.guillermomaldonado.org/blog/statement-from- apostle-guillermo-maldonado Views on coronavirus Disregarding the coronavirus pandemic, Maldonado urged his congregants to show up for worship services in person. \\"Do you believe God would bring his people to his house to be contagious with the virus?

Despite this, studio time was booked for October 2013, with nothing really planned. No songs had been written, but apparently the music kept coming. More studio time was thus booked for November. Also announced as part of this project is a live album, which was released simultaneously. The live album is called Thanks for the Feedback, and features 20 songs from one of the band's performances at their own PUSAFEST '11.PledgeMusic ‚Äì Updates Pledgers were able to pledge money on a limited edition colored vinyl of the album, where the color of the vinyl version was voted on by the pledgers.

Part of the World Music Network Rough Guides series, the release covers a broad swathe of the music of Indonesia, both traditional and modern. The compilation was produced by Phil Stanton, co- founder of the World Music Network. Paul Fisher compiled the tracks and wrote the liner notes, and Duncan Baker coordinated the project. Critical reception The album met critical appraise upon release. In his review for AllMusic, Bret Love rose the subject of non-gamelan Indonesian music's obscurity in the West, calling the compilation an \\"accessible introduction to some very unfamiliar musical traditions\\". Robert Christgau called it \\"crass\\" even by the standards of the series, and \\"at least as edutaining as Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?\\". Writing for JazzTimes, Josef Woodard called it \\"as much a treat for the ears as it is a challenge to our preconceptions\\". Both Christgau and Woodard contrasted the record with the 20-CD Music of Indonesia series by Smithsonian Folkways, comparing the latter's ethnomusicological focus with the Rough Guide's pop overtones.

According to Plutarch, it made a frightening sound, resembling a mix of animal noises and lightning, and was used by the Parthians to scare their opponents in battle instead of the more typical Greek battlefield instruments, the salpinx or horn. According to Plutarch, a rhoptron was made from hollowed-out piece of pine or fir that had only one opening (stoma), unlike a frame drum, which were also used by the Greeks. This piece was somehow fitted with bronze bells (k≈çd≈çnes) and covered with oxhide, so that the bells collided with the head as it was played. In this way it resembles a snare drum more than a tambourine, though the latter is often used in translation. The rhoptra were played with the fingers, not sticks. Rhoptra were also known as rhombos, which also designated a bullroarer. Among the Ancient Greeks it also meant a door knocker,Liddell- Scott-Jones Dictionary of Classical Greek, rhoptron a meaning it retains in the modern language. NotesReferences * * Thomas J.

A naturally talented and powerful fighter, Quinn recorded 20 professional wins, 18 of which came by knock out. Amidst reports of a lackadaisical approach to training and a taste for partying, Quinn's early potential went unfulfilled. His career stalled following high profile defeats to Siarhei Liakhovich, Kali Meehan and, in Quinn's final bout in May 2011, Seth Mitchell. In February 2012, Quinn gunned down Raul Bennett Sambola in their mutual home town of Bluefields following a family feud. After spending a year on the run, Quinn was finally arrested in April 2013. He admitted to the murder and was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Amateur career Quinn entered boxing due to his father, who had himself boxed in the 1980s. Whilst serving in the Nicaraguan army, Quinn was dominant in the country's amateur boxing ranks, winning all 38 of his contests. Having left the army, he turned professional in 2004. Professional career Quinn spent his first two years as a professional fighting in Nicaragua and neighbouring Costa Rica. Compiling a 13-2 record and earning the nickname \\"The Sandman\\", he attracted the attention of American promoter Don King, whose organisation gave him a contract allowing entry the US to participate in more lucrative bouts. He won his first four fights in the US, including a dominant performance against JJ McAllister in 2007, whom he knocked down 49 seconds into the first round. Having built up a sequence of 13 victories but gaining a reputation within the boxing fraternity for being more interested in carousing than serious training, Quinn was unexpectedly defeated by journeyman Harvey Jolly on April 24, 2009, in St. Louis on a split decision. He subsequently lost his next two fights, against former WBO world champion Siarhei Liakhovich in Germany and ex-rugby player Kali Meehan in Australia. Quinn returned to Nicaragua for a couple of a confidence boosting bouts against locals before returning to the US to face up-and-coming fighter Seth Mitchell. Mitchell defeated Quinn by knockout in the first round, with Quinn having fallen to his knees following a few hard jabs from Mitchell and declining to get up. It was to prove his last professional fight. Quinn travelled to Australia for a training camp but quit after two weeks and returned home. Personal life A huge figure in his impoverished home town, Quinn was known for encouraging or cajoling fellow townsfolk into performing civic improvement activities. Despite this, he also had a number of run-ins with local authorities. In one incident he used his physicality to deprive a naval officer of their AK-47 after they demanded that he stopped smoking a cannabis joint in public, and was subsequently arrested. In 2008, Quinn and his father were accused of being involved in a plot to break two Colombian drug traffickers out of prison and kill the prosecutor of their case. Quinn denied the charges, which were subsequently dropped. Murder conviction In 2011, Quinn came across Raul Bennett Sambola, whose boat had run out of fuel. Quinn gave Sambola fuel for which Sambola would repay him at a later date. When the time came, Sambola refused to pay the amount that Quinn claimed was owed. In retribution, Quinn took the engine from Sambola's boat and told police that he would only return it when he was paid the money that he was owed. A few weeks later, Sambola shot Quinn's younger brother Jorge twice in a nightclub, leaving Jorge with life-changing injuries. Sambola was arrested, but released on the condition that he paid for Jorge‚Äôs medical bills. A furious Quinn told the police that if they didn't lock Sambola up then he would kill him. Returning from a trip to Miami three months later and finding Sambola still free, Quinn went on a local radio show to announce that if Sambola didn't leave town within a month then he would be killed. Thirty days later, on February 19, 2012, Quinn shot Sambola to death in a busy restaurant. Quinn got a taxi to the quayside and made his escape on a jet ski. Quinn then went on the run, evading capture for over a year before finally being arrested in April 2013, along with three of his wives and two Colombians who were with him at the time. He was charged with both Sambola's murder and other charges including being head of a criminal enterprise involved with drug and people trafficking. Quinn admitted to committing the murder but denied the other charges. For the murder he was sentenced to 17 years in La Modelo prison.

Zhang's death was then described in the Zizhi Tongjian before it went on to describe the events of the 12th lunar month, strongly implying that Zhang was executed on the same day that Shi ordered his execution, but not directly stating so.) was an official of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period states Later Liang and Later Tang. He had his most powerful positions during the reign of Later Tang's last emperor Li Congke, as both chancellor and the director of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies). After Li Congke was overthrown by his brother-in-law Shi Jingtang, who established his own Later Jin, Shi ordered Zhang be put to death.  Background and service during Later Liang  It is not known when Zhang Yanlang was born, but it is known that he was from Kaifeng. During Later Liang, he served as an administrator under the director of material pricing, later becoming the material pricing adjustor at Yun Prefecture (ÈÑÜÂ∑û, in modern Tai'an, Shandong).History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 69.  During Later Tang = During Li Cunxu's reign = In 923, Li Siyuan, a major general for Later Liang's archrival Later Tang, which was then ruled by Li Siyuan's adoptive brother Li Cunxu, captured Yun Prefecture in a surprise attack, and was subsequently commissioned by Li Cunxu as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered at Yun).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Zhang Yanlang came under his command, and he had Zhang continue to serve as the material pricing adjustor. Later (after Later Tang destroyed Later Liang later in 923), when as Li Suyuan was moved to Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered at Kaifeng) (in 924) and later Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) (in 925),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. Zhang followed him to those assignments and served as the circuit treasurer. At some point, Zhang fostered his relationship with Li Siyuan's chief strategist An Chonghui by giving a daughter in marriage to An's son.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. = During Li Siyuan's reign = In 926, Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at the capital Luoyang. Li Siyuan claimed the throne thereafter. He made An Chonghui his chief of staff, and An, on account of the marital relationship between his son and Zhang Yanlang's daughter, had Zhang made the deputy chief of staff. Meanwhile, Li Siyuan had executed Li Cunxu's director of material pricing, Kong Qian, under the rationale that Kong's harsh taxes had driven the people against Li Cunxu. The directorate of material pricing ‚Äî which Later Liang had established to replace Tang's three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies) and merge them into one ‚Äî was abolished. Rather, the three agencies were reestablished, at least in name, as separate agencies, and typically placed under the command of a chancellor.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 26. In 927, Zhang, who was then also carrying the title of director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi), was made the acting director of the three agencies, but continued to also serve as the director of palace affairs. He was also apparently, at the same time, serving as the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan). In 928, when Li Siyuan was preparing to launch a general campaign against the warlord Wang Du the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) after Wang Du had tried to, but failed to, assassinate the imperial general Wang Yanqiu, it was Zhang that Li Siyuan sent to the front to consult with Wang Yanqiu and the other generals stationed nearby to determine the strategy. Later, when the Khitan Empire sent an army to try to aid Wang Du, Zhang and Wang Yanqiu both commanded armies in defeating the joint Yiwu/Khitan army.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 930, Zhang Yanlang was given the titles of acting minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu) and director of the three agencies (‰∏âÂè∏‰Ωø, Sansishi). This was the first time that anyone was given the title of Sansishi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. (He was later, though, made the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong), and then of Xiongwu Circuit (ÈõÑÊ≠¶, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu), although it was unclear whether these assignments were made during or after Li Siyuan's reign.) = During Li Congke's reign = In 934 ‚Äî by which time Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke was emperor ‚Äî Zhang Yanlang was serving as the military governor of Xiongwu. That year, the commander of the army at Wen Prefecture (ÊñáÂ∑û, in modern Longnan, Gansu), Cheng Yangui (), surrendered the prefecture to Later Shu. Zhang launched his army and put Wen Prefecture under siege. When the Later Shu general Li Yanhou () sent a relief force, however, Zhang lifted the siege and withdrew, allowing Later Shu to retain Wen. Shortly after, Li Congke recalled him from Xiongwu, made him Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)), and made him a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), as well as acting director of the three financial agencies.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. In early 936, Li Congke, concerned that his brother-in-law (the husband of Li Siyuan's biological daughter the Princess of Jin), Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), would rebel, consulted a number of imperial officials on what to do to ward off a Hedong rebellion. L√º Qi () advocated entering into an alliance with the Khitan by submitting a large financial gift to the Khitan. Zhang was very supportive of L√º's proposal, believing that not only would it ward off a Hedong rebellion, but it would create great savings in border defenses. He and L√º therefore drafted a proposed communique to the Khitan. However, when Li Congke consulted the imperial scholar Xue Wenyu (), Xue not only opposed, but persuaded Li Congke that it would be humiliating, particularly because the Khitan Emperor Taizong may insist on marrying Li Congke's daughter (or have a Khitan prince do so) under the Heqin system. Li Congke thus rejected the proposal. Meanwhile, over the years he served as Li Congke's acting director of the three agencies, Zhang, apprehensive of a possible Hedong rebellion, tried to reduce the amount of revenues Shi had access to by strictly examining the tax revenues from Hedong, allowing the circuit to retain only the amount of revenues it was entitled to keep legally and requiring it to submit all other tax revenue to the imperial government, drawing Shi's resentment. Later in the year, when Li Congke tried to test Shi's loyalty by transferring him to Tianping, Shi rebelled and, with a Khitan force commanded by Emperor Taizong himself aiding him, defeated the Later Tang force Li Congke sent against him, commanded by Zhang Jingda. The remnants of Zhang Jingda's army was surrounded by the Hedong/Khitan forces at Jin'an Base (ÊôâÂÆâÂØ®, near Taiyuan). Upon Zhang Jingda's defeat, Li Congke's young son Li Chongmei the Prince of Yong volunteered to command another Later Tang army against the combined Hedong/Khitan forces, and initially Li Congke was inclined to agree. However, Zhang Yanlang, Liu Yanlang (), and Li Congke's brother-in-law Liu Yanhao (brother of Li Congke's wife Empress Liu), all advocated that Li Congke himself command the army, despite Li Congke's own lack of desire to do so. Li Congke felt compelled to do so. Zhang, not trusting Li Congke's chief of staff Zhao Yanshou, also had Zhao removed from the scene by supporting fellow chancellor Lu Wenji's proposal to have Li Congke send Zhao north to rendezvous with Zhao's father Zhao Dejun the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) to jointly face the Hedong/Khitan army, and Li Congke did so. Meanwhile, also under Zhang Yanlang's suggestion, Li Congke issued a general conscription order, requiring a collection of the people's horses, as well as the requirement to have one man enter the military for every seven households. The result of the conscription order only yielded 5,000 soldiers and 2,000 horses, creating no real help for the imperial army but causing the people much alarm. Subsequently, Zhang Jingda's army, which was then facing starvation, surrendered after Zhang Jingda's deputy Yang Guangyuan killed him. The Later Jin/Khitan army (Shi having been created the emperor of a new Later Jin by Emperor Taizong by this point) also defeated Zhao Dejun and Zhao Yanshou's army, and was heading for Luoyang. Li Congke, believing the situation to be hopeless, committed suicide with his family by fire, ending Later Tang. Shi subsequently entered Luoyang.  Death  Shi Jingtang summoned the Later Tang officials to an imperial gathering. At the gathering, he declared a general pardon for all present ‚Äî except for Zhang Yanlang, whom he arrested and put into jail. He subsequently issued an edict, reaffirming the pardon, but excepting Zhang, Liu Yanlang, and Liu Yanhao from the pardon. Zhang was then executed. It was said, though, that later when Shi was trying to find a suitable person to head the three financial agencies but could not find one, he regretted killing Zhang.

Digital electronics is at the heart of computers, but there are many direct applications of digital electronics. All these digital electronics need data to be presented to them in a digital format (i.e. the data have to be digitally conditioned). This is called digital conditioning. Since computers are electronics devices, all the information they work with has to be digitally formatted. Therefore, if they are used to control a variable such as temperature, then the temperature has to be represented digitally. That's why we need digital signal conditioning to condition process-control signal to be an approximated digital format.Curtis D. Johnson, \\"Process Control Instrumentation Technology\\" Sep 6, 2006. Introduction and digital fundamentals Digital signal conditioning in process control means finding a way to represent analog process information in digital format.Ram√≥n Pall√°s- Areny, John G. Webster, \\"Sensors and Signal Conditioning, 2nd Edition\\", November 2000. Use of in control system is particularly valuable number of other reasons, however: # A computer can control multivibrator process-control system. # Nonlinearities in sensor output can be linearized by the computer. # Complicated control equation can be solved quickly and modified as needed. # Networking of control computers allow a large process-control complex to operate in a fully integrated fashion. Digital information The use of digital techniques in process control system hat process variable measurements and control information be encoded into a digital form. Digital signals themselves are simply two-scale (binary)Goodwin, Graham C., Richard H. Middleton, and H. Vincent Poor. \\"High-speed digital signal processing and control.\\" Proceedings of the IEEE 80.2 (1992). These levels may be represented in many ways. For example, two volts, two currents, two frequencies etc. Digital words Given the simple binary information that is carried by signal digital, it is clear that multiple signals must be used to describe analog information. Generally, this is done by using an assemblage of digital levels to construct a binary number, often called a word. The individuals digital levels are referred to as bits of the word. Thus, for example, a 6-bit word consists of six independent digital levels, such as 101011_2, which can be thought of as six-digit base 2 number. An important consideration, then, is how the analog information is encoded into this digital word. Digital whole numbers One of the most common scheme for encoding analog into s digital word is to use the straight counting of decimal (or base 10) and binary numbers representations. Some examples Ex. 1. Find the base 10 equivalent of the binary whole number 00100111_2 ? Solution. As in the base 10 system, zero preceding the first significant digit do not contribute. Thus, the binary number is actually 100111, and n=5, decimal equivalent can be computed as follows: N_10 = a_5 2^5 + a_4 2^4 + . . . . + a_1 2^1 + a_0 2^0 N_10 = (1)2^5 + (0)2^4+(0)2^3+(1)2^2+(1)2^1+(1)2^0 N_10 = 32+4+2+1 N_10 = 39 See also * Signal conditioning ReferencesExternal links * http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3735/15/8/001 * http://www.hbm.com/en/menu/products/industrial-amplifiers/ * http://sine.ni.com/np/app/main/p/ap/daq/lang/en/pg/1/sn/n17:daq,n21:11/fmid/2998/ Category:Digital electronics ","title":"Digital signal conditioning"},{"id":"41605442","text":"Hypercompe mus is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Charles Oberth√ºr in 1881.

It was built in the then- fashionable Queen Anne style, but was significantly remade in the Craftsman style in 1917 by builder Emmett Moseley. It is a 1.5 story wood frame house built on a foundation of poured concrete and brick piers. Its roof is a multi- level gable-on-hip design, with shed dormers on each elevation. A porch wraps around three sides of the building, and is extended at the back to provide a carport. The interior was not significantly remade in 1917, and retains Colonial Revival details. In addition to being a distinctive local instance of Craftsman styling, the house was the first in the area to be wired for electricity at the time of its construction.

These codes apply the signs of SASL to the grammar of the oral languages, resulting in Signed English, Signed Afrikaans, Signed Xhosa, Signed Zulu, etc. They are not a natural form of communication among deaf people. Manually coded language is commonly used instead of SASL for simultaneous translation from an oral language into sign, for example at the Deaf Forum that is held annually at different locations in the Western Cape. The result is that, while deaf people from different language communities can communicate with each other without difficulty in SASL, they cannot understand \\"sign language\\" interpreters unless they have been schooled in the particular manually coded language used by the interpreter.

It is currently located at 231 11th Avenue in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City.  History and mission  Printed Matter, Inc. was founded by a loose consortium of artists, critics, and publishers‚Äîincluding Sol LeWitt, Lucy Lippard, Carol Androcchio, Amy Baker (Sandback), Edit DeAk, Mike Glier, Nancy Linn, Walter Robinson, Ingrid Sischy, Pat Steir, Mimi Wheeler, Robin White and Irena von Zahn‚Äîin 1976 as a for- profit art space in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. The original concept arose from Sol LeWitt's desire for artists to take over the means of production of their variously serious, unique, and oddball artist's books (alternatively known as \\"bookworks\\" or \\"book art\\"). At the time, these artist's books were viewed as inconsequential and used by dealers as free promotional materials, instead of being regarded as art. Lucy Lippard cites International General, an independent publisher of artists' books run by artist Seth Siegelaub, as a model for Printed Matter Inc. In 1976, Printed Matter's inaugural catalog of books included both established and lesser-known artists who are signal artists of their generations, including Kathy Acker, Laurie Anderson, Carl Andre, John Baldessari, Daniel Buren, Susan Hiller, Adrian Piper, Ad Reinhardt, Martha Rosler, Edward Ruscha, and Lawrence Weiner. Printed Matter is one of the first organizations dedicated to creating and distributing artists' books, incorporating self-publishing, small press publishing, and artist networks and collectives. Historically there was no lack of publishers of these works, but there was a real need for distributors; Printed Matter functions as both a distribution agency as well as a publisher of artists' books. Printed Matter focused heavily on the distribution of these artists' books because it could simultaneously broaden the reach of art outside museums and allow artists to \\"control their own production.\\" The works published by Printed Matter are editioned and are conceived by artists as artworks. However, due to mass-producing they can be sold at affordable prices (currently around $5-$50), as they are meant to spread the accessibility of art. Printed Matter also serves as a support system for avant-garde artists as well as a place of community, often balancing its role as publisher, exhibition space, retail space, and community center of the downtown arts scene. Many artists rely on Printed Matter's commitment to fostering creative output that is overlooked by commercial art galleries and publishers. Printed Matter also holds on-site courses and workshops for middle school, high school, and college students interested in DIY publishing and distribution. Corporate status and operations In 1976 writer and editor Ingrid Sischy was hired by Sol LeWitt and the board of directors as the inaugural director of Printed Matter, Inc. By 1978 she was successful in applying for and being granted 501(c)(3) corporate non-profit status, and Printed Matter Inc officially became a non-profit organization with a focus on artist publications. Materials on view at Printed Matter are either discovered through a submission process or arrive via a network of artists, distributors, and publishers. Because of the non-traditional approach to curating content, the inventory of Printed Matter is very diverse, representing the long tail concept of offerings. The mail order catalog model of fulfillment is how Printed Matter maintains a global reach to its worldwide customer base, which includes libraries, archives, and museums, as well as academic institutions and individuals. The collected works are organized by artist's name, with special sections organized by genre i.e. zines, audio works, periodicals, or publisher. Each summer the inventory is assessed from top to bottom resulting in a comprehensive backlist and updated archive being ready for perusal in the Fall season. Printed Matter also curates artists' window installations in the front window that engage the public beyond the prospect of buying and selling books.

Early life  Hazarvi was born in Chamba Village, Kot Najeebullah, North-West Frontier Province, British India. His father Abdul Hameed Hazarvi, an Islamic scholar, belonged to the Hazarewal Karlal tribe. He was a follower of the Chishti Order.Adams, p.100-101 He was the elder of his four brothers and sisters.Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi . Official website of the Jamaat-e-Islami.

Hazarvi was a great Mudarris and in the month of Ramadan especially he would teach Dowra Qur'an to advanced students over the 30 days. Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi being one of the best speakers in South Asia, he was a brilliant orator, and he had his gifted ability to answer and reply spontaneously. Many people would go \\"Mast\\" when he delivered his speeches. Ghazali-e-Zaman Syed Ahmad Saeed Kazmi Shah would consider himself uneducated in front of him. Hazarvi shared a close relationship with Muhaddith-e-Azam Pakistan Moulana Sardar Ahmad Qadri; both had studied under Hamid Raza Khan.

Pakistan Study Centre, University of Karachi, 2002Akbar S. Ahmed (1999) Islam today: a short introduction to the Muslim world. I.B.

When Pakistan movement began for the independence of India, the Indian National Congress was supported by many Muslim scholars, leaders and the learned who were devotees of Indian nationality and stood side by side with the Hindu leaders. Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi announced his assistance and loyalty to Qa‚Äôid A‚Äòzam in the struggle to acquire Pakistan. After the passage of Lahore Resolution he gave an all out support to the Mohammad Ali Jinnah for the achievement of Pakistan. He made intensive tours of the country to generate support for the AIML. He advised his followers to work for the AIML and emphatically declared that he would not lead the funeral prayers of any devotee if he had not participated in the Pakistan Movement in any capacity.

Agitation for democracy During the Ayub era, nine prominent leaders belonging to different political parties were tried for mutiny under the Official Secret Act. The nine of them had decided to initiate a democratic movement; As a president of Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi was one of the nine. The trial lingered on for two years. Ultimately, the case was taken back by the government, for lack of evidence. In 1965, the joint opposition was organised, he was one of its central leaders. Along with other leaders of the Combined Opposition Party (COP) , Hazarvi toured the two wings of the country (East and West Pakistan) to create mass awareness and organise a strong national democratic movement. The military ruler, president Muhammad Ayub Khan (1958‚Äì1969), banned political parties and warned Hazarvi against continued political activism. Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan supported the opposition party, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). In the 1964‚Äì1965 presidential elections, Hazarvi supported the opposition leader, Fatima Jinnah.  Opposition to other sects  Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian claimed to be the Mahdi (messiah) awaited by Muslims, as well as a Ummati Nabi, a subordinate prophet to Muhammed who brings no new Sharia but instead restores Islam to its pure form. These claims proved controversial among many Muslims, and Hazarvi branded Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as a heretic and apostate and called him and his followers (Ahmadis) Kuffar.Zahid Aziz, Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam (2008) A survey of the Lahore Ahmadiyya movement: history, beliefs, aims and work. A.a.i.i.l. (u.k.), . p. 43 Hazarvi was also the founding member of Majlis-e-Tahaffuz-e-Khatme Nabuwwat, Pakistani nationalist Muslim political movement in Pakistan. He led a movement against Ahmadis and held a Khatme Nabuwwat Conference at Rabwah in 21‚Äì23 October 1953. Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi was a central figure in the Khatme Nabuwwat Movement of 1953, which demanded that government of Pakistan declare the Ahmadis as non-Muslims. Hazarvi was active in the Khatme Nabuwwat movement. Beliefs and Practices=Beliefs regarding Muhammad= Hazarvi believed that: *Muhammad is a human being but created from light like angels, rather than from clay like other human beings. *He is present in many places at the same time.N. C. Asthana & A.Nirmal. Urban Terrorism : Myths And Realities. Publisher Pointer Publishers, 2009 , 9788171325986. pg. 67 *He is still witnessing all that goes on in the world. *He has knowledge of that which is unknown, including the future.Clinton Bennett. Muslims and modernity: an introduction to the issues and debates. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005 , 9780826454812. pg. 189 *He has the authority to do whatever he desires as granted to him by God. *Although human, he possessed a n≈´r (light) that predates creation. This contrasts with the Deobandi view that Muhammad was insan-e-kamil (\\"the complete man\\"), a respected but physically typical human. *He is haazir naazir (can be present in many places at the same time, as opposed to God, who is everywhere by definition). *God has granted him ilm-e-ghaib (the knowledge of the unseen). Hazarvi wrote: =Practices= *Public celebration of Muhammad's birthday.Sirriyeh 1999: 49Sirriyeh 2004: 111 *Veneration of the dead, specifically those who lead pious/righteous lives. This consists of the intervention of an ascending, linked and unbroken chain of holy personages claimed to reach ultimately to Muhammad, who Barelvis believe intercede on their behalf with God. *Visiting the tombs of Muhammad, his companions and of pious Muslims, an act the Barelvis claim is supported by the Quran, Sunnah and acts of the companions, but which opponents call \\"shrine-worshipping\\" and Grave worshiping and consider to be un-Islamic. *Use of devotional music. *Leaving the beard to grow for men; the Hazarvis views a man who trims his beard to less than a fist-length as a sinner, and shaving the beard is considered abominable.Arun Shourie, The World of Fatwas or the Sharia in Action, pg. 135. ASA Publications, 1995.  Works Hazarvi wrote and translated books on a variety of subjects, including his compilation of Manaqib-al-Jaleela, is a book on Islamic Jurisprudence.A‚Äòlahazrat as a Translator of Holy Qur‚Äòan. wimnet.org Other works include: * Tahqiq-ul-Haq Fi Kalima-tul-Haq (The Truth about Kalima-tul-Haq) * Shamsul Hidayah * I'la Kalimatillah Fi Bayan-e-Wa Ma Uhilla Bihi Legharillah * AlFatuhat-us- Samadiyyah (Divine Bounties) * Tasfiah Mabain Sunni Wa Shi'ah * Majmua Fatawa Ideology Hazarvi's understanding of Islamic law has been presented concisely in his book Manaqib-al-Jaleela. Hazarvi's inspiration from his mentor, Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi and non-traditionalist approach to the religion has parted him from traditionalist understanding on a number of issues, but he never goes out of the traditional framework. =Jihad= Hazarvi believes that there are certain directives of the Qur'an pertaining to war which were specific only to Muhammad and certain specified peoples of his times (particularly the progeny of Abraham: the Ishmaelites, the Israelites, and the Nazarites). Thus, Muhammad and his designated followers waged a war against Divinely specified peoples of their time (the polytheists and the Israelites and Nazarites of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of Divine punishment and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for jizya and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from death punishment and for military protection as the dhimmis of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam. The only valid basis for jihad through arms is to end oppression when all other measures have failed.Mizan, The Islamic Law of Jihad According to him Jihad can only be waged by an organised Islamic state. No person, party or group can take arms into their hands (for the purpose of waging Jihad) under any circumstances. Another corollary, in his opinion, is that death punishment for apostasy was also specifically for the recipients of the same Divine punishment during Muhammad's times‚Äîfor they had persistently denied the truth of Muhammad's mission even after it had been made conclusively evident to them by God through Muhammad.Islamic Punishments: Some Misconceptions , Renaissance ‚Äì Monthly Islamic Journal, 12(9), 2002. The formation of an Islamic state is not a religious obligation per se upon the Muslims. However, he believes that if and when Muslims form a state of their own, Islam does impose certain religious obligations on its rulers as establishment of the institution of salat (obligatory prayer), zakah (mandatory charity), and 'amr bi'l-ma'ruf wa nahi 'ani'l-munkar (preservation and promotion of society's good conventions and customs and eradication of social vices; this, in Hazarvi's opinion, should be done in modern times through courts, police, etc. in accordance with the law of the land which, as the government itself, must be based on the opinion of the majority). The Qur'an states norms for male-female interaction in surah An-Nur. While in surah Al-Ahzab, there are special directives for wives of Muhammad and directives given to Muslim women to distinguish themselves when they were being harassed in Medina.Mizan, Norms of Gender Interaction The Qur'an has created a distinction between men and women only to maintain family relations and relationships.Mizan, The Social Law of Islam =Penal laws= * The Islamic punishments of hudud (lit. \\"limit\\" or \\"boundary\\") are maximum pronouncements that can be mitigated by a court of law on the basis of extenuating circumstances.Mizan, The Penal Law of Islam * The shariah (Divine law) does not stipulate any fixed amount for the diyya (monetary compensation for unintentional murder); the determination of the amount‚Äîfor the unintentional murder of a man or a woman‚Äîhas been left to the conventions of society. * Ceteris paribus (all other things being equal), a woman's testimony is equal to that of a man's.The Law of Evidence , Renaissance ‚Äì Monthly Islamic Journal, 12(9), 2002. * Rape is hirabah and deserves severe punishments as mentioned in the . It doesn't require four witnesses to register the case as in the case of Zina (Arabic) (consensual sex). Those who were punished by stoning (rajm) in Muhammad's time were also punished under hirabah for raping, sexually assaulting women, and spreading vulgarity in society through prostitution. =Sources of Islam= * All that is Islam is constituted by the Qur'an and Sunnah. Nothing besides these two is Islam or can be regarded as its part.Mizan, Sources of Islam * Just like Quran, Sunnah (the way of the prophet) is only what Muslim nation received through ijma (consensus of companions of the prophet) and tawatur (perpetual adherence of Muslim nation). * Unlike Quran and Sunnah, ahadith only explain and elucidate what is contained in these two sources and also describe the exemplary way in which Muhammad followed Islam. * The Sharia is distinguished from fiqh, the latter being collections of interpretations and applications of the Sharia by Muslim jurists. Fiqh is characterised as a human exercise, and therefore subject to human weakness and differences of opinion. A Muslim is not obliged to adhere to a school of fiqh. Death Hazarvi died on 9 October 1970, in a road accident at Wazirabad, Punjab, Pakistan. He left 2 sons and 4 daughters elder son name was Mufti Abdul Shakoor Hazarvi and second son is Muhammad Tariq Hazarvi.

It was originally released by the Daiei Motion Picture Company (later acquired by Kadokawa Pictures). Zatoichi's Flashing Sword is the seventh episode in the 26-part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi. Plot A lone yakuza musketeer chases after Ichi alongside a canal and shoots him in retaliation for Ichi cutting the yakuza boss and to earn the prestige of his more experienced fellows. His fellow yakuza arrive and he claims to have killed Ichi but without a corpse they don't believe him. Ichi is rescued from the water and a travelling stranger pays a local townswoman to nurse Zatoichi back to health. When well again Ichi travels to the stranger's home town to express his gratitude. The yakuza learn of Ichi's survival and his destination. They go after him and leave the failed shooter behind. He goes alone to make up for his lost face. On the way to Kajikazawa, Ichi passes by a sword dojo being roughed up by some stray ronin. Ichi laughs and the four ronin challenge him with shinai. He mocks them for wanting to beat up a blind man then defeats them all in a few seconds. When Ichi arrives in Kajikazawa, he finds that the stranger was not a man but was Kuni, daughter of Bunkichi, one of the two town bosses. Her father is planning a free fireworks display and goes across the river to talk to rival boss Yasugoro. Yasugoro wants control of the river ford as all travellers have to pay to cross. Ichi stays with Kuni and does chores around the house and massages around town. He massages Yasugoro's sister in Yasugoro's house and overhears that Yasugoro and the local government Inspector, who is sleeping with the sister, are conspiring to force control away from Bunkichi. The musketeer arrives in town and is revealed to be Seiroku, Bunkichi's son who fled town after racking up drinking debts and refusing to pay. He soon sees Ichi. The four ronin arrive Yasugoro hires them to kidnap Seiroku. Yasugoro's men claim Seiroku tried to kill Yasugoro. They say Bunkichi can either hand over the river right's, fight or they will kill Seiroku. Yasugoro's sister tells Yasugoro that the Inspector says to kill the prisoner to start a war. The Yakuza pursuing Ichi find him at the river bathing. He goes into deeper water and when they follow, he kills them while submerged. He goes to the Inspector's house, meets with him and Yasugoro's sister, kills them both and frees Seiroku. Seiroku proves ungrateful. He goes home and lies about escaping by himself. The lead ronin comes up with a plan to break Ichi's alliance with Bunkichi. Yasugoro sends a letter to Bunkichi claiming the Intendant will mediate at a meeting. Bunkicihi arrives and Yasugoro claims the mediator isn't present because Yasugoro wants Bunkichi to have a chance to give up the famous fugitive Ichi rather than have Bunkichi arrested for harbouring the criminal. Bunkichi falls for the deceit and sends Ichi on his way. Ichi is confused about why he is being forced to leave before the fireworks and refuses the money Bunkichi offers. Kuni is distressed that Ichi must leave and that she can't say why. As he says goodbyes to the household he tells Seiroku, having recognised Seiroku by scent when Seiroku arrived at home, that \\"you really shouldn't shoot people with guns\\" then he leaves town. With Ichi gone Yasugoro attacks Bunkichi's house killing almost everyone present (but not Kuni and her sister who are safe in a locked storeroom). Ichi, wishing to see, or at least be close to, the fireworks turns back and over hears the ronin, who are camped outside of town, as they brag about the plan. Ichi kills them and goes to Yasugoro's house to exact retribution. He cuts down the candles and forces them to fight in the dark. After killing Yasugoro he stands for a moment in the light of the fireworks.

Founded by Emile Pequignet in 1973, the company is owned now by two entrepreneurs: Philippe Spruch and Laurent Katz.  History  In 1973, Emile Pequignet, designer and founder of a watchmaking concern, set up his own business in Morteau, France. As a native of Haut-Doubs, he was a horse breeder and a recognized horseman; he took part in many national riding events and invested thirty percent of his communications budget in equestrian sponsorship. The Emile Pequignet brand was associated with the world of horseriding and in 1980th was presented an ‚ÄúEquitation‚Äù line of wristwatches, whose dials represent horses' heads engraved on a coin. Another inspiration that Emile Pequignet took was exotic countries. This is seen in the collections MOOREA (inspired by the island in French Polynesia), SAKKARA (the most ancient pyramid in Egypt) and MASSAI (name of an African tribe). When retirement arrived, Emile Pequignet looked for a successor who would retain the firm‚Äôs independence. In 2004 Didier Leibundgut, marketing director at Zenith, acquired control of Pequignet's watchmaking business.Vive la difference. In: Retail Jeweller, July 2006, UK At the beginning of his governing the brand, Pequignet offered customers a choice of more than 150 different watch straps and bracelets in a variety of colors and materials, enabling the appearance of the watch to be changed at the whim of the wearer. The brand was mostly targeted to women.DNA Watcher, by David M Robertson.

Playback, September 13, 1993. The film centres on Jeanne O'Neil (Andr√©e Lachapelle), a single mother running a small inn in rural Quebec with her daughter Alfa (√âlise Guilbault). The family's life is turned upside down, however, when bisexual prodigal son Alex (Roy Dupuis) and old family friend Jean-Louis McKenzie (Gilbert Sicotte) simultaneously arrive for a visit, causing chaos as Alex's sociopathic tendencies begin to blow the lid off the family's dysfunctional and borderline incestuous emotional life. Supporting cast members in the film include Macha Limonchik, Gabriel Gascon, Luc Picard, Andr√© Brassard, Caroline Dhavernas and Mich√®le Deslauriers. The film garnered Genie Award nominations for all four of its lead actors at the 14th Genie Awards, with Dupuis and Sicotte nominated for Best Actor and Guilbault and Lachapelle nominated for Best Actress. The film was originally inspired by a family-owned inn in Saint-Joseph-de-la-Rive where director and screenwriter Michel Langlois had worked in his youth.\\"Entrevue avec Michel Langlois et Andr√©e Lachapelle - Mer et Monde, un √©chec int√©ressant\\". Le Devoir, March 5, 2009. The film first entered development in 1984 as La Travers√©e, with L√©a Pool originally slated to direct. However, she dropped out of the project, and Langlois brought it to French director Paul Vecchiali. Vecchiali was subsequently also unable to direct the film and Pool returned to the project a second time, but was again forced to drop out. Langlois subsequently put the film on hold, opting to take other jobs in the film industry so that he could learn how to direct the film himself. He continued to write other screenplays, and directed several short films before completing a final draft of Cap Tourmente in 1991 and entering production in 1992 as the film's director. Both Dupuis and Guilbault had previously also acted in Langlois' short film Sortie 234. In 2009, Langlois released M√®re et monde, a documentary film about the real family who had inspired the film. Plot Alex O'Neil has a deeply troubled mind. He also has a dysfunctional and incestuous family. He returns from his merchant seaman job to the rocky coasts of his home. His mother, Jeanne, doesn't seem to mind, and lets him stay at her bed and breakfast hotel. His sister, Alfa, seems to have the hots for him, just as she does for their old boyfriend Jean-Louis, who has just shown up. Jeanne seems to be attracted to him. All these people appear eager to get their hands on his body, but he's too wrapped up in what's going on inside his head to notice.

A pioneer in manufacturing elastic knits, the Chantelle brand grew thanks to the 'Kretz tulle' used first in its corsets, then in its bras. The company has been owned by the Kretz family since the 1900s.  History  A 1971 Magazine ad of Chantelle in Persian, Zan-e Rooz. * 1876: The company that would become Chantelle is founded at the end of the 19th century, as a manufacturer of elastic knits. * The 1900s: At the time, women's figures are still tightly corseted in dresses with a train. Maurice Kretz, Fran√ßois Auguste Gamichon's nephew, begins to manufacture corsets made of elastic fabrics in 1902. * The 1930s: The launch of the \\"little black dress\\" by Chanel in Vogue magazine in 1926 leads many women to \\"abandon\\" their corsets. Jean Kretz, a textile engineer and Maurice Kretz's son, refines the weaving methods and launches \\"Kretz tulle\\", an elastic fabric. * The 1940s: Claude Kretz, who has joined his father in the company, uses \\"Kretz tulle\\" to manufacture the first girdles. The Chantelle brand is first used in 1949. * The 1950s: New Look silhouettes, wasp waists and pneumatic breasts appear; their icon is the American actress Mae West. The Chantelle girdle, suppler and lighter than the corset, launches with the slogan: \\"Chantelle, the girdle that stays in place.\\" * The 1960s: On the eve of ready-to-wear, Chantelle launches its first bras under the impulse of Claude Kretz. In 1962, Chantelle opens its first bra manufacturing plant in Epernay in the Champagne region. * The 1970s: Chantelle launches the \\"D√©fi\\" model in 1972, the very first molded bra. * The 1980s: Chantelle launches the risque \\"Vertige\\" model in 1983, one of the first see- through and plunging neckline bras. * The 2000s: Chantelle moves toward invisible products and T-shirt bras. Its \\"Women of the World\\" campaign highlights the \\"Africa\\" and \\"Graphie\\" lines. * The 2010s: Chantelle launches a more casual line, based on technologies offering freedom of movement and comfort, like Spacer and Memory foam innovations. Iconic Products *1972: Introduction of the \\"D√©fi\\" model onto the market ‚Äì the very first molded, seamless, bra, prioritizing good support for the bust. * 1982: Launch of the \\"Les ch√©ris\\" collection, which evokes a new style of seduction. *1983: Chantelle dares to go see-through and offers a plunging neckline with \\"Vertige\\" supported by a campaign by Jacques S√©gu√©la. *1999: The \\"Hedona\\" molded bra meets women's new expectations. * 2013: Chantelle launches its first Swimwear collection for the Spring/Summer season.

In 2015 it entered a new phase in this process by closing a deal with Waterland, a private equity firm that was looking for a digital agency to invest in. TamTam became the launching platform for a buy-and-build-strategy. The deal opened up many possibilities and soon deals were made with other companies that added their specialism to the digital mix.

The book was well received and won multiple awards in 2014: Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, The Goldsmith Award, and Top honors at the San Francisco Book Festival. Content Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies. By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms \\"Siren Servers,\\" alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example, he points to Google's translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. As a solution to this problem, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson‚Äôs Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.  Structure  The book is divided into nine parts plus a conclusion. Lanier ends each part of the book with interludes. Each interlude is tailored to the theme of the chapters contained in each part of the book. The interludes read like mini fictional short stories and others suggest guiding thoughts on what reader could take away from the theme in each cluster of chapters. = Chapters = # First Round # The Cybernetic Tempest # How This Century Might Unfold, from Two Points of View # Markets, Markets, Energy Landscapes, and Narcissism # Contest to Be Most Meta # Democracy # Ted Nelson # The Dirty Pictures (or, Nuts and Bolts: What a Humanistic Alternative Might Be Like) # Transition # Conclusion Reception Joe Nocera from the New York Times said: Janet Maslin from the New York Times compares Lanier to Michael Jackson, the \\"King of Pop\\", while dubbing Lanier \\"the father of virtual reality\\".

He finds her twin sister Juliette who promises to aid him in his increasingly desperate search for her elusive sister... Reception In The New York Times, Jennifer Kornreich writes, \\"This successor to the Marquis de Sade's identically titled novel says nothing new about the nature of pleasure and pain. What it more ably accomplishes is a depiction of the ghoulish transformation of a nameless London art collector from creepy predator to humble captive after he meets twin sisters who bear an uncanny likeness to the portrait of his ideal woman\\" and she concludes \\"Ultimately, however, he discovers that the dainty object of his unhinged affection is even more depraved than he is.

Her works have been shown at the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. She began her studies at the Art Institute of Chicago and continued as she pursued her Bachelor's and Master of Fine Arts degrees. She has taught art at the college level, including School of Art and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. and at the Corcoran Gallery of Art's Dupont Center for Advanced Studies. Inspired by Henri Matisse, Paul C√©zanne and √âdouard Manet, she made paintings of mothers and children in the 1960s. During that decade, she owned a gallery in Indianapolis. Her art changed markedly in the 1970s when she shifted to performance and other forms of art, as well as how women are depicted in art. Her studies of philosophy and psychology greatly influenced her art, both in terms of content and medium. Important works of the early 1970s are representations of goddesses, which Edelson used as a contrast against established, patriarchal viewpoints of women. In Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper, the faces of the disciples are replaced with noted women artists, and Story Gathering Boxes explored stories of the feminine experience. Other notable works include The Negotiation and Kali Bobbitt. She worked to increase the rate at which works of art by women are among museum collections. She helped found and was an active member of the Heresies Collective, which published the Heresies journal, to show and promote art made by women. She also joined the feminist cooperative gallery, A.I.R. Gallery (Artists In Residence), which held exhibits of Edelson's work, including The Memorial to the 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era. In that exhibit, the intention was to empower women attendees. She was also active in the civil rights movement. Personal life=Early life and education= Mary Beth Edelson was born Mary Elizabeth Johnson in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1933. She was the eldest of three children born to Mary Lou and A. M. Johnson, a dentist. Her siblings are Jayne and Allan. Encouraged by her parents, she became interested in art and activism in her early teens. Upon learning that a German family had escaped from a labor camp (German: Arbeitslager), Edelson organized a group, called a \\"peace cell\\", which supports people who have experienced trauma. She was 13 years old. Art Institute of Chicago She started taking classes at the Art Institute of Chicago during the weekends when she was around 13 years of age. She developed an interest in creating large works of art when she created stage flats for Washington High School's theater. From 1951 to 1955, Edelson studied at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, where she majored in art and minored in philosophy and speech. Her works were exhibited in 1955 at a solo senior-year exhibition, where one of her paintings was deemed unseemly for \\"ministers and small children.\\" Angry faculty members demanded the works to be pulled from the show, which resulted in protest at the university. She studied during the summers at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1953‚Äì1954). She received her Master of Fine Arts degree in 1958 from the New York University. =Relationships and children= Edelson resided in New York during the mid-1950s. She married a lawyer, Jerome M. Strauss, on June 5, 1959 and then lived as Mary Beth Strauss in Indianapolis. By 1961, she was president of the 1444 Gallery. They had a daughter, Lynn. Upon her divorce, her ex-husband was granted primary custody of her daughter. Her experience is told in Phyllis Chesler's book, Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody. She married Alfred H. Edelson, the CEO of Rytex Stationery, in 1965 and became Mary Beth Edelson. He purchased Talbot Gallery as a wedding present for her. He was the president of the Democratic council of Indiana and on the board of the Fletcher National Bank. She has in total four children born between 1959 and 1967: Eric, Lynnor (Lynni), David, and Nick. Edelson has lived in SoHo, Manhattan since 1976. SoHo is a part of New York City known for its art galleries. In 1968, she left Indianapolis for Washington, D.C. with her husband, Alfred H. Edelson. They later divorced. By 1972, Edelson was living with artist Robert Stackhouse in her Washington, D.C. house. The couple moved to New York in 1976. They lived in Soho in a loft with a living area and two studios, one for each artist. Edelson and Stackhouse were together for 15 years. Early career During the second half of the 1950s, Edelson became active in the emergent feminist movement and the civil rights movement. Her work in the 1960s‚Äîinspired by Henri Matisse, Paul C√©zanne and √âdouard Manet‚Äîwere made of scenes of mothers and children. Edelson's feminist and conceptual art consists of bronze sculptures, paintings, collages, prints, story gathering boxes, and sketches. She is also a photographer, book artist, and performance artist. She taught art at Park School in Indianapolis, Montclair State College in New Jersey, and, after 1968, at the School of Art in Washington, D.C. She taught at the Corcoran Gallery of Art's Dupont Center for Advanced Studies and at the Smithsonian for a nine-week women's study course in art. Feminist art movement Edelson is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Rachel Rosenthal, Carolee Schneemann, and Judy Chicago. In 1968, she established the country's first Conference for Women in the Visual Arts in Washington, D.C. Edelson presented her first feminist speech at the Herron Art Museum in 1968. She began a protest after an \\"all-male biennial\\" and \\"all man traveling art show\\" at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. They were not billed as all male, but no women were represented. Fueled by her frustration, she picketed with other women artists. Women's art groups were established after the event. She became active in the feminist art movement and created performance art that glorified women after she moved to Washington, D.C. Working within the larger conceptual framework of the 1970s feminist art movement, Edelson's paintings, collages, and performances challenged hegemonic patriarchal values. Common themes in Edelson's work from this period include: ancient goddess figures, such as \\"the enigmatic Baubo, the trickster Sheela-na-gig, an Egyptian bird goddess, and Minoan snake goddesses\\"; references to popular culture; and subversions of art historical scenes. Lucy Lippard describes Edelson's approach to her artmaking: \\"Mary Beth Edelson's work arises from Feminism‚Äôs double strength. Like the great Goddess to whom she has dedicated her art, she has (at least) two aspects‚Äîpolitical rage and life-giving affirmation. The two merge in an individual identification with the collective ego: 'Women exploring who \\"we are\\" and not who \\"I am\\"'.\\" Edelson joined the feminist cooperative gallery, A.I.R. Gallery (Artists In Residence), which held exhibits of Edelson's work, including The Memorial to the 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era. In that exhibit, she used fire circles and fire ladders as rituals in 1977. The intention was to empower women attendees. She was an active participant in the Heresies Collective from its early days of operation. Chrysalis and the Heresies Collective, including the Heresies publication, were founded in part due to Edelson's efforts. She was a leader of the Committee on Diversity and Inclusion and the Women's Action Coalition from 1992 and 1994, respectively. Edelson was a member of the Title IX Task Force, a group formed to increase the presence of women's painting and sculpture in museums in accordance with the Title IX amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that bans federally funded organizations from sex discrimination. The group, assembled in 1998, filed a complaint with the National Endowment for the Arts against the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. The complaint addressed the underrepresentation of works of art by women in these museums, which in turn has the effect of restricting art dealers ability to sell art made by women. The artist was included in the 2007-2009 \\"WACK! Art of the Feminist Revolution\\" traveling exhibition, curated by Connie Butler. It was removed from the exhibition, though, because audiences were not interested in the art of the 1970s, focused on the feminine body and spirituality. She was interviewed for the film !Women Art Revolution. Edelson was interviewed for the Archives of American Art Oral History Program in the first half of February 2009 at her New York studio by former Independent Curators International (ICI) executive director Judith Olch Richards. The program has interviewed artists, critics, historians, and others since 1958 to record visual arts history. Over her career, she has lectured at museums and universities across the United States and internationally. Edelson's personal archives are held by the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University. Notable works=Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper= Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. Christ's head is overlaid with that of Georgia O'Keeffe. The artists collaged over the apostles include Lynda Benglis, Louise Bourgeois, Elaine de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Nancy Graves, Lila Katzen, Lee Krasner, Georgia O'Keeffe, Louise Nevelson, Yoko Ono, M. C. Richards, Alma Thomas, and June Wayne. As well, other women artists have their image shown in the border of the piece; in all eighty-two women artists are part of the whole image. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \\"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.\\" Proposals for: Memorials to the 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era, a 1977 performance piece, had the same objective. New York's Museum of Modern Art acquired the original work Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper along with four other original collage posters in the series. Among the works in the 22 Others exhibitions in 1973 and 2013, it is declared her \\"most famous work\\" by Karen Rosenberg of The New York Times. =Story Gathering Boxes= Story Gathering Boxes, an ongoing participatory artwork, was initiated in 1972 and exhibited though at least 2014, when it was shown at Aldridge Contemporary Art Museum in Hartford, Connecticut. The purpose of the exhibit is to question long-held beliefs and myths by learning and sharing stories with others. Paper cards contains a prompt inviting viewers to share personal stories on various topics, such as gender, childhood, and immigration. Story Gathering Boxes allows all viewers to participate in the creation of a collective narrative. The project was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, and The Florsheim Foundation. =Kali Bobbitt= Edelson's life-size monument to Lorena Bobbitt, who famously castrated her abusive husband in 1993, is entitled Kali Bobbitt (1994). It was included in MoMA PS1's 2015 survey show Greater New York. The sculpture reimagines Bobbitt as the warrior goddess Kali, mounted on a ziggurat plinth, adorned with knives, and grasping a severed penis. Edelson explains: =Other works= The Negotiation, made in the 1980s on a 10 foot by 18 foot canvas, depicts a man and a woman in an embrace and seems to reflect self-insight. In 1980, she created Shaking the Grass, gelatin silver print mounted on board and Seven Cycles: Public Rituals, offset lithograph on paper, both of which are at the Walker Art Center. Inspiration=Goddess metaphor= During the 1970s Edelson aligned herself with the feminist neopaganist goddess movement. She refers to Great Goddess theory throughout her work. Primordial archetypes, like the goddess, warriors, and tricksters that she invokes, represent a contrast to women of formalized, patriarchal societies. As Edelson states in 'Male Grazing: An Open Letter to Thomas McEvilley', published in the April 1989 New Art Examiner, her enduring interest has been in \\"destabilizing preexisting representations of masculine desire and privilege in relationship to the female body.\\" She continues: \\"My rituals also provided resistance to the mind/body split, by acknowledging sexuality in spirituality, thus reconciling the experience of a united spirit, body, and mind.\\" According to Lucy Lippard, ritual is Edelson's \\"prime form.\\" The National Museum of Women in the Arts' biography of Edelson states: \\"Her site-specific performances or 'rituals' [‚Ä¶] strove to create a new feminine spirituality with its own values and iconography.\\" Recurring \\"esthetic talismans\\" in her iconography are stone and fire, substances \\"at the heart of the Great Goddess myths that she is adapting to contemporary needs.\\" For example, Edelson invited visitors to ritually enter through a flaming ladder installation titled Gate of Horn for her 1977 show at A.I.R. Gallery memorializing the 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era. On Halloween, adopted as the Woman‚Äôs New Year, another public ritual took place in the gallery and outside street. The artist's own naked body acts as a stand-in for the divine feminine in Women Rising (1973), Moon Mouth Series (1973-4), and later Goddess Head (1975) photomontages, for which the artist documented herself performing private rituals in nature and altered the images with a grease pencil to resemble mythological women such as Wonder Woman, Kali, the Wiccan Spiral Goddess, and Sheela-na-gig. She explains her conception of the goddess as \\"an internalized, sacred metaphor for an expanded and generous understanding of wisdom, power and the eternal universe.\\" Her perspective is derived from her studies and research of philosophy, mythology, and psychology. She is particularly influenced by Carl Jung. =Nude women's bodies= Edelson draws attention to the female nude to address the ways in which women have been \\"exploited and underrepresented in the history of art.\\" She has used black-and-white photographs of her own naked body in both indoor and outdoor spaces as a ground for her paintings. \\"By presenting herself so self-possessed and unapologetically unclothed, she hoped to help loosen the centuries-old grip that male artists held on the passive female body,\\" wrote the !Women Art Revolution. She created performance art using photographic works that involved body art, including O‚ÄôKevelson, shown in 1973, where her self-portraits were revised with a grease pencil until they resembled Louise Nevelson or Georgia O'Keeffe. Collections Among the noteworthy museums with Edelson's work are: Guggenheim Museum, Guggenheim Museum, and MoMA PS1 in New York. In Washington, D.C., they are among the collections of Corcoran Gallery and National Museum of American Art.

At the 2006 census, its population was 2,168, in 663 families. Nashalj Village is one of the tourism attractions of Kashan which, due to its unique texture, mild climatic conditions, snowy winter and cool summers, shines like a jewel. Nashalj is Located 43 km northwest of Kashan, the natural beauties of the village, along with its high security against the attack of thieves, attracted people to this area, Mehr News Agency reported. Name Folk etymology derives the name Neshalj from the phrase Noh-salj (ŸÜÿ´ŸÑÿ¨), meaning \\"nine-snow\\" and interpreted to mean that there are nine months of snow each year in the village. A more probable origin, according to Habib Borjian, is a derivation from a prefix, either *ni- (\\"down\\") or *ni≈°- (\\"out\\"), attached to a root such as *rak (\\"arrange\\"), referring to the prominent ridges and gorges around the village. Characteristics  The village is located on the northern slope and has beautiful buildings in terms of texture and architectural style. The ceiling of each house is the courtyard of another house. Buildings in the village reveal that its residents made optimum use of climatic and geographical conditions. The presence of two bathhouses in the village indicates the attention of residents toward health and cleanliness. Water canals exceeding 2,500 meters hint at the firm will of the people to live in the village. Due to the village's geographical position (suitable soil, water and weather), farmers are active in the field of horticulture. There are five water reservoirs in the village, the historical precedence of some dates back to the Safavid era. Given the average rainfall of 200 mm per year, the village is a suitable place for growing sweet-scented Mohammadi rose. The village is famous for its rosewater. Poetry written by Bahram Nashalji about 700 years ago shows that the culture of friendship prevailed in the village.

Founded in Shanghai in 1925 by the Shaw (Shao) brothers led by Runje Shaw (Shao Zuiweng), the company also established operations in Malaya and Hong Kong. Although the company's Shanghai studio was destroyed in 1937 during the Japanese invasion, its offshoot in Hong Kong, later called Shaw Brothers Studio, blossomed into a media empire under the leadership of the youngest brother, Sir Run Run Shaw. Founding Runje Shaw (Shao Zuiweng), the oldest Shaw brother and founder of Tianyi In 1922, Runje Shaw (Shao Zuiweng), the eldest Shaw brother who had been a lawyer and businessman, was the manager of the theatre Xiao Wutai (Happy Stage or Laughter Stage) in Shanghai. Among his colleagues were Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Zhou Jianyun, who co- founded Mingxing Film Company. In 1923 Mingxing released the film Orphan Rescues Grandfather to great commercial success. Inspired by his former colleagues, Shaw established Tianyi Film Company in 1925. He served as general manager and director, while his younger brothers Runde Shaw (Shao Cunren) and Runme Shaw (Shao Renmei) managed accounting and distribution. The youngest brother, Run Run Shaw (Shao Yifu), did odd jobs for the company. History 1926 Tianyi film Lady Meng Jiang, starring Hu Die =1920s= Tianyi's first film, A Change of Heart (Á´ãÂú∞Êàê‰Ωõ), directed by Shao Zuiweng himself and released in 1925, was highly profitable. A shrewd businessman who understood the audiences' preferences, Shao was one of the first Chinese filmmakers to make extensive use of traditional literature, legends, and myths. Tianyi made highly successful genre films, including costume drama, swordplay, and gods and ghosts, inspiring numerous imitations from other studios. The studio's 1925 film Swordswoman Li Feifei is considered by some as the earliest Chinese martial arts film. In 1926, Tianyi released two highly successful costume dramas: The Lovers (Liang Zhu Tongshi, based on the legend of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai), and White Snake (based on the eponymous legend), both directed by Shao Zuiweng. In addition to success in the domestic market, White Snake also became the most successful Chinese film in Southeast Asia. =1930s= By the 1930s, Tianyi had become one of the top Chinese film studios, along with Mingxing and Lianhua. Unlike other major studios, which produced politically charged, socially conscious leftist films, Tianyi mainly focussed on making apolitical \\"entertainment\\" films. Tianyi was one of the first filmmakers to take the leap from silent films to sound. In 1931, Shao produced A Singer's Story (Ê≠åÂ†¥Êò•Ëâ≤), one of the earliest Chinese sound films, directed by Li Pingqian. The film White Gold Dragon (1933) was the first Cantonese language sound film, inspired by Shao's encounter with Cantonese opera performers in Shanghai; the film was very successful in Hong Kong, Macao and throughout Southeast Asia. Starting in 1934, Tianyi made a series of Mr. Wang comedy films adapted from the popular comic strip of Ye Qianyu. =World War II= Still riding the success of White Gold Dragon Shao moved to Hong Kong with his brother, where the brothers became key figures in establishing Cantonese cinema in Hong Kong. After the Shao brothers recovered from the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong and Singapore during World War II, they expanded their film distribution business to include foreign films from the United States, England, France and India. International expansion Sir Run Run Shaw (Shao Yifu), the youngest Shaw brother who expanded the business in Singapore and Hong Kong Besides Shanghai, Tianyi also expanded its business to Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. In the mid-1920s, Shao Zuiweng sent Runme and Run Run to Singapore, then part of British Malaya, where they established a company called the Shaw Organisation to distribute films made by Tianyi. Around 1930, the Shaw brothers set up Nanyang (South Seas) Film Studio to produce films. In 1933, Tianyi released White Gold Dragon, the first Cantonese talkie ever produced, which was a commercial success in southern China. Tianyi subsequently established a studio in Hong Kong in 1933‚Äì34 to produce Cantonese films. The move to Hong Kong was accelerated by the banning of martial arts films by the Chinese government as these films were thought to be morally decadent and promote superstition, as well as a ban on Cantonese films. Both of these genres were important to Tianyi as they were very popular among the Chinese diaspora communities, and Tianyi exported its Mandarin films produced in Shanghai and Cantonese films produced in Hong Kong throughout Southeast Asia. Its Hong Kong studio was destroyed by a fire in 1936, but Runde Shaw, the second eldest brother, reestablished the business as Nanyang Studio, later renamed Shaw and Sons. Demise in Shanghai Just before the Japanese invasion of Shanghai in August 1937, Tianyi shipped its equipment to Hong Kong, and amalgamated the main operation with its Hong Kong branch, Nanyang Studio. Its studio in Shanghai was destroyed when the Japanese occupied the city, and Shao Zuiweng closed Shanghai-based Tianyi. The other major studios of Shanghai, Mingxing and Lianhua, also suffered fatal damage. The Shaws' operations in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia later also suffered setbacks during World War II, when the Japanese confiscated their theatres and imprisoned Run Run Shaw. Legacy After World War II and the Communist victory in mainland China, Shao Zuiweng retired from the film industry and stayed in Shanghai. His younger brothers, meanwhile, rebuilt their businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong. When Hong Kong emerged as the new centre for Chinese-language filmmaking, Run Run Shaw moved there from Singapore in 1957, and reorganized the Tianyi operations into Shaw Brothers Studio. Under Sir Run Run's leadership, Shaw Brothers became Hong Kong's largest and most influential film production company from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s. Shaw later concentrated on TVB, which became the dominant television company in Hong Kong.

The canal fell into disuse in the mid-20th century but has since been restored.  History  The Tralee Ship Canal was built to accommodate larger ships sailing into Tralee as the quay in Blennerville was becoming unpractical to use due to silting, while merchants in Tralee were not satisfied with its facilities at the start of the 19th century. The House of Commons authorised an Act of Parliament in June 1829 for the canal with work beginning in 1832. Issues with funding meant that the canal was not completed until 1846 when it was opened to ships. The canal was 2 miles long in length with a new canal basin built in Tralee, lock gates and a wooden swing bridge constructed in Blennerville. Large ships of up to 300 tonnes could navigate the canal but not long after the canal opened it too began to suffer from silting. By the 1880s Fenit harbour was built which was a deep water harbour and did not suffer from silting. A railway was constructed soon afterwards between Fenit and Tralee carrying cargo and freight from ships moored there. Due to silting the canal fell into disuse and neglect, and was closed in 1951.  Restoration  Following the restoration of Blennerville Windmill in the early 1990s it was envisaged that the canal could be restored as a tourist attraction. In 1999 the Office of Public Works (OPW) started a restoration project of the canal at a cost of IR¬£650,000. It involved the excavation of the basin, a new swing bridge constructed at Blennerville, the lock gates being restored and the canal being dredged of silt. The basin area of the canal was subsequently redeveloped with apartments blocks built as part of a proposed marina while the towpath along the canal was upgraded and is now used by people as an enjoyable amenity as part of the Dingle Way. Tralee Rowing Club use the canal and have a boathouse at the basin.

The chemical spill occurred upstream from the principal West Virginia American Water intake and treatment and distribution center. Following the spill, up to 300,000 residents within nine counties in the Charleston, West Virginia metropolitan area were without access to potable water. The areas affected were portions of Boone, Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Logan, Putnam, and Roane counties and the Culloden area of Cabell County. Crude MCHM is a chemical foam used to wash coal and remove impurities that contribute to pollution during combustion. The \\"do-not- use\\" advisory for drinking water from West Virginia American Water's system began to be gradually lifted by West Virginia state officials on January 13 based upon \\"priority zones.\\" On Tuesday, January 14, the company revealed that the tank, which leaked about 7,500 gallons into the ground by the Elk River, had also contained a mixture of glycol ethers known as PPH, with a similar function as MCHM. The chemical spill was the third chemical accident to occur in the Kanawha River Valley within the last five years. On June 12, 2014 another spill of containment water occurred at the same site.  Freedom Industries  Freedom Industries was founded in 1992 by Melody, and Carl L. Kennedy II. On December 31, 2013, Freedom Industries merged with three other companies, Etowah River Terminal, Poca Blending, and Crete Technologies. Gary Southern became president of Freedom Industries on December 10, 2013 and remained president until April 2014 when Chemstream appointed a reorganization officer. The company distributed chemicals used in coal mining. Freedom Industries' Charleston facility was located along the Elk River, approximately upstream from the river's confluence with the Kanawha River, Previously in use by Etowah River Terminal, the facility stored chemicals in 14 storage tanks with a capacity of 4 million gallons. The facility stored chemicals, but did not conduct coal cleaning. Eastman Chemical Company was the manufacturer of the crude MCHM. Federal and West Virginia state regulators had not inspected the Freedom Industries chemical storage site in Charleston since 1991 when the facility was owned by Pennzoil, according to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP). Under state law, the facility had been required to have only an industrial stormwater permit, which it possessed. Freedom Industries was required to test the rain runoff every quarter, and send the results to the DEP. Under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Freedom Industries filed its \\"Tier Two\\" form in February 2013, which contained detailed information about each chemical it was storing at its Charleston facility. Following its filing of the tier two form, West Virginia state emergency response officials and Kanawha County emergency planners and responders received copies. These entities received copies of the form under law so that its chemical inventory information could be utilized to prepare plans for possible accidents.  4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol  Chemical structure of 4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol. 4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM), or more appropriately 4-methylcyclohexylmethanol, is an organic compound with the formula CH3C6H10CH2OH. Classified as an alcohol, it exists as two isomers with similar properties. MCHM is a colorless oil with an odor of licorice. The amount of reliable information of this chemical is still unknown. Further data from Eastman's internal studies was released after the Elk River, West Virginia (2014) spill, including the studies upon which the LD-50 estimate was based and one 28-day study of oral toxicity of pure MCHM which concluded that 400 mg/kg doses were associated with erythropoietic, liver, and kidney effects, though these were not considered more than \\"minor toxicity\\" and the \\"no observed effect\\" level was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day.[43] Crude MCHM is a chemical foaming agent utilized in the processing of coal at coal preparation plants to remove impurities that contribute to pollution during combustion. The chemical washes coal in a process known as \\"froth flotation,\\" which involves the separation of sand-size particles of coal from the surrounding rock within a tank of water or other solution. MCHM is utilized in about 20 to 25 percent of coal preparation plants in West Virginia. MCHM is not used in the majority of West Virginia's coal preparation plants, because it is only used to produce coal for metallurgical purposes, a type of coal known as \\"coking coal\\" and most West Virginia plants process coal that is to be used for the generation of electricity. Diesel fuel was originally used for the froth flotation process, but it was replaced by MCHM because of air emissions regulations. Glycol ethers are a group of solvents based on alkyl ethers of ethylene glycol commonly used in paints. These solvents typically have a higher boiling point, together with the favorable solvent properties of lower-molecular weight ethers and alcohols.46 Incident The spill began on Thursday, January 9, 2014 when up to of crude MCHM leaked from a one-inch hole in the bottom of a stainless steel storage tank capable of holding and its containment area at Freedom Industries' Charleston facility. The MCHM leaked from the containment area and into the ground, through which it traveled into the Elk River. The chemical spill occurred upstream from West Virginia American Water's raw water intake at its Kanawha Valley Water Treatment Plant. The Elk River measured approximately in depth at the time of the spill. Charleston's downtown skyline (pictured) viewed from the south bank of the Kanawha River, of which the Elk River is a tributary. The spill was noticed around mid morning on January 9 by several Charleston area residents when they began to notice a \\"sweet smell\\"(like Licorice) in the air. DEP began receiving odor complaints from Charleston residents at 8:15 a.m. According to Freedom Industries, two employees noticed leakage from the tank into the containment area around 10:30 a.m. on January 9. According to the company's president, Gary Southern, workers began cleanup immediately by hauling away the remaining MCHM in the storage tank and vacuuming the spilled MCHM from the ground nearby. However, the DEP, whose inspectors discovered the leak at 11:10 a.m. in response to residents' complaints about the odor, contradicted Southern's claim. When the department's inspectors arrived at the facility, they observed the MCHM leaking through a concrete block containment dike with no cleanup or containment measures underway. Inspectors found a wide stream of chemical liquid flowing across the floor of the containment dike and into the ground where the dike's wall joined with its floor. According to DEP inspectors, they discovered a pool of clear liquid measuring approximately in size outside of the damaged white stainless steel tank, Number 396. DEP inspectors also stated that Freedom Industries' workers had set up one cinder block and a bag of safety absorbent powder to stop the flow of the stream of leaking chemical. DEP air quality inspector Mike Kolb described the scene as \\"a Band-Aid approach\\" and stated further that it was \\"apparent that this was not an event that had just happened.\\" The DEP and the Kanawha County Fire Department had been able to locate the origin of the leak by tracing the smell. At the time of the leak's discovery by the inspectors, the damaged storage tank contained about of MCHM. West Virginia American Water was aware of the chemical spill by noon, but assumed that they could filter it. By 4 p.m., when its carbon filtration system could no longer handle the large amount of contamination in the water and the chemical began flowing through the carbon filter, they decided to report the problem. This they did at 5:09 p.m. West Virginia American Water concluded that its tap water was unsafe for use and instructed its customers to cease using its tap water at 5:45 p.m. Freedom Industries failed to contact West Virginia American Water following the spill, and West Virginia American Water was instead notified by the DEP. Freedom Industries refused initial media inquiries following the spill. The company's president, Gary Southern gave a ten-minute news conference the next evening, January 10. =Local residents= Residents were advised not to drink, cook with, bathe, or wash with West Virginia American Water tap water; up to 300,000 residents were affected. The area affected spanned nine counties within the Charleston, West Virginia metropolitan area. The areas affected included Boone, Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Logan, Putnam, and Roane counties and in the Culloden area of Cabell. The majority of Cabell County was unaffected as its public water system uses water from the Ohio River, and some residents in Saint Albans in Kanawha County, Lincoln County and Hurricane in Putnam county were not affected by the water ban as they were served by local public water systems. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources stated that 122 people had sought treatment by January 11 for symptoms including nausea and vomiting. Of those 122 people, four people had been admitted to the Charleston Area Medical Center and one at another area hospital for observation with symptoms of nausea. On January 12, the number of patients treated at hospitals for their symptoms from chemical exposure grew to about 169. By that evening of January 10, nearly 700 residents had contacted West Virginia's poison control center, reporting a range of symptoms including nausea and rashes. On January 13, the total number of residents who had been hospitalized had risen to 10, and by January 14, the total reached 14, although none were in were in serious condition. By 1 p.m. on January 10, the sweet-smelling odor was no longer detectable, according to West Virginia National Guard Adjutant, Major General James Hoyer. On January 11, the chief of DEP's Homeland Security and Emergency Response division, Mike Dorsey, stated that of MCHM had spilled into the river, more than had previously been estimated. The \\"do-not-use\\" advisory on drinking water from the West Virginia American Water system began to be lifted by West Virginia state officials on January 13, five days after it had been put into effect following the January 9 detection of the chemical spill. The lifting of the ban started with hospital facilities and extended zone by zone within the West Virginia American Water system. Following the gradual end to the \\"do-not-use\\" advisory, affected Charleston area residents were instructed to flush water from their pipes, hot water tanks, and the icemakers in their refrigerators. West Virginia American Water began lifting the \\"do-not-use\\" ban in downtown Charleston, and would begin phasing in use of the system's drinking water based upon \\"priority zones.\\" By the evening of January 13, 15 percent of West Virginia American Water's customers were permitted to begin using the drinking water. On January 13, a Kanawha County Circuit Court judge issued a temporary restraining order to preserve evidence at the Freedom Industries' Charleston facility. The order also prohibited the company from modifying in any manner \\"any structure, tank, equipment, material or condition of\\" its facility, except as necessary to stop and clean up the chemical spill. On January 21, Freedom Industries notified West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection that a second chemical, polyglycol ethers (PPH), was in the leaking tank with the MCHM. The department said that the failure to report accurately the type of materials and the quantities is a violation of state law. A one- year incident timeline can be found published in the Supporting Information section of a 2014 research paper A case study of the incident can be found published here . This report only includes information that was publicly available as of March 2016. This report does not include the findings and information released by the US Chemical Hazard and Safety Board, US National Toxicology Program, and other academic studies. Information disclosed as part of these studies indicated more than 100 mg/L of 4-MCHM was present in the Elk River, levels greater than 3.773 ppm 4-MCHM were present in the water treatment plant, among other information.  Government response  Va. Guard personnel assist W.Va. water collection operations. On January 9, West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin declared a state of emergency, and activated the West Virginia National Guard. Governor Tomblin ordered residents within the spill's affected areas to \\"continue to refrain from using the water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, bathing and washing.\\" United States President Barack Obama further declared the chemical spill a Federal state of emergency on January 9. Following the President's declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was directed to provide both assistance on the ground and federal funding for the state's emergency management efforts. FEMA and the West Virginia National Guard distributed bottled water to the nine affected counties. The West Virginia Bureau of Public Health and the West Virginia National Guard began working on a \\"long-term\\" plan to ensure the availability of water and food supplies for residents in the affected areas. The West Virginia National Guard also provided potable water in tankers. On January 10, FEMA had sent 75 trucks, each carrying about of water. By the morning of January 11, the United States Department of Homeland Security had sent 16 tractor trailers of bottled water to 16 distribution centers around the Charleston metropolitan area. At a news conference on January 11, FEMA officials announced that they had already brought approximately of potable water into affected areas. The unaffected city water departments in Milton and Hurricane and the Putnam Public Service District in Scott Depot provided their water for free to area residents, and attempted to minimize confusion, as their systems were not affected by the West Virginia American Water system's tap water ban. Booth Goodwin, United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia commenced a formal \\"investigation into the circumstances surrounding the release.\\" Goodwin stated that a \\"negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation.\\" On January 10, Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper announced plans to request that the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigate the incident. CSB officials were in the process of reviewing information about the spill and planned to make a decision to deploy to the Charleston area by January 11. On January 11, CSB officials announced they were to arrive in Charleston on January 13 to begin their investigation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration also opened its own investigation of the incident. The Environmental Protection Agency had found no violations and had not taken enforcement actions against the Freedom Industries Charleston facility within the last five years. DEP did reveal that the facility had been the subject of a previous \\"odor complaint\\" \\"several years ago,\\" although the complaint was determined by DEP to be unfounded. Following the spill, the DEP issued a violation notice on January 10 to Freedom Industries for releasing MCHM into the air and violating West Virginia's Air Pollution Control Act and the Water Pollution Control Act, and it subsequently ordered that its Charleston facility's 11 other tanks be emptied and the chemicals moved off site. By the night of January 9, the West Virginia National Guard began testing the contaminated water in the Elk River. The National Guard utilized its own lab, in addition to labs from DuPont and the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The National Guard also requested two additional labs to expedite the water testing process. West Virginia American Water coordinated with DuPont and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to determine the contamination level within its system. A total of four labs were set up to continue testing the amount of the chemical remaining in the water. On January 12, Governor Tomblin stated that he was coordinating with DEP secretary, Randy Huffman, to draft recommendations for preventing future chemical leaks. Because MCHM was not considered a \\"hazardous\\" chemical, Freedom Industries' Charleston facility was not inspected by the DEP. Another West Virginia regulation requiring chemical companies to provide \\"immediate\\" notice of a spill leaves it to the DEP chief to determine what \\"immediate\\" notice is on a case by case basis. As of January 13, West Virginia state authorities continued their investigation as to which state laws Freedom Industries broke leading up to and following the MCHM spill. The tank that leaked showed signs that it may have been damaged by water that froze during unusually cold weather. On January 9, 2015, Governor Tomblin released a report detailing the state's response to the Freedom Industries chemical leak.WV.gov, Office of the Governor (2015), \\"Governor Tomblin Announces Water Crisis After Action Review Available Online \\" The report provides chronological detail of each state agency and commission's role in responding to the state of emergency and includes several questionnaires completed by state workers directly involved in the response.State of West Virginia. \\"After Action Report\\" Threat to human health The chemical released was \\"crude MCHM,\\" which was intended for use as a foaming/wash agent to aid in the processing of coal. Little is known about MCHM's potential effects on human health, nor about its effects on aquatic environments. While its manufacturer, Eastman Chemical Company, is required by law to produce a safety data sheet (SDS), much of the information in the data sheet is incomplete, according to a report by the Christian Science Monitor. Contaminated water smelled sweet, resembling licorice. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, if consumed the chemical may provoke the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, diarrhea, reddened/burning skin and/or eyes, itching, and rashes. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists stated that MCHM caused headaches, eye and skin irritation, and difficulty breathing from prolonged exposures at high concentrations. Both health and company officials have stated the chemical consumption is not known to be fatal, even if consumed in its purest form. The chemical leaked was highly diluted due to the large amount of water involved; however, due to the potential health effects, authorities advised over 300,000 residents in surrounding communities to avoid utilizing the water for cooking, drinking, or bathing. Because shipment of MCHM is not regulated by the United States Department of Transportation, it was not being considered \\"hazardous\\" by emergency response and environmental protection officials. However, under the regulatory standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, MCHM is considered \\"hazardous.\\" The chemical's manufacturer, Eastman Chemical Company, identified it as a \\"skin irritant that could be potentially harmful if ingested.\\" The Eastman Chemical Company's material safety data sheet for crude MCHM identifies hazards, included skin and eye irritation, and at elevated temperatures, irritation of the eyes and of the respiratory tract. The median lethal dose of MCHM is 825 milligrams per kilogram of body mass, when tested in rats.  Environmental impact and cleanup  The president of West Virginia American Water stated that his company was not aware of a treatment to remove the chemical from its system. Because of this, West Virginia American Water began flushing miles of lines within its Charleston area water system, although as of January 11, there was no timetable as to when its system would be safe for area residents to use. West Virginia American Water's engineers began adding additional carbon and other chemicals to speed the treatment process and move the contaminated water out of its water distribution system. Michael Dorsey, Chief of the DEP's Homeland Security and Emergency Response division stated that tests conducted on water samples taken on the night of January 9‚Äì10 showed the concentration of MCHM had decreased from 2 parts per million to 1.7 parts per million. That finding remained above the 1 part per million recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as \\"acceptable.\\" The West Virginia National Guard continued to test the water every hour and its teams worked overnight between January 9 and 10 to perform tests and report results on both inflow and outflow samples of the Elk River's water. Each test took approximately 46 minutes. Tests conducted over the weekend of January 11‚Äì12 at four locations indicated a safe amount below 1 part per million of the chemical. Despite this, officials continued testing throughout the water system's distribution area into January 13 before ending the system- wide \\"no use\\" advisory. The chemical's manufacturer, Eastman Chemical Company, maintains that when MCHM is diluted, the compound does not have adverse effects on the aquatic environment. No fish kills were reported following the spill and there was no apparent effect on aquatic life, according to West Virginia state officials. , the Elk River serves as the sole remaining habitat for the diamond darter (Crystallaria cincotta). On July 26, 2013, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service formally designated the diamond darter as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The potential risk of the chemical spill to the diamond darter has not been reported.  Resulting closures  The West Virginia Legislature and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia at the West Virginia State Capitol (pictured) cancelled sessions on January 9, following the tap water ban. As a result of West Virginia American Water's notice that the tap water was unsafe following the spill, Charleston area businesses closed and hospitals took emergency measures to conserve water. School systems within the affected eight counties were also closed. Charleston area residents hurried to nearby stores to stock up on available bottled and packaged water. The West Virginia Legislature, which had reconvened following its winter break, cancelled its business on January 9. On January 9, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in Charleston and the courts in Boone and Lincoln counties closed. West Virginia State University in Institute also cancelled its classes for the duration of the tap water outage. Because of the lack of potable water, Charleston cancelled a convention of mayors and city council members from around the state of West Virginia, which had been scheduled to begin on January 13. = Litigation = As of January 10, the day following the chemical spill from Freedom Industries' Charleston facility, at least eight lawsuits had been filed against the chemical company. The lawsuits were filed on behalf of Charleston area businesses forced to close during the resulting state of emergency and on behalf of all West Virginia American Water customers. The plaintiffs have asked to be granted class action status and are seeking punitive damages and compensation for lost profits during the state of emergency. A further lawsuit was filed against Freedom Industries and West Virginia American Water on January 10 by a patient whose kidney transplant was cancelled due to the water outage. By January 13, a Kanawha County judge had granted a temporary restraining order against Freedom Industries, and the number of lawsuits filed in the Kanawha County Circuit Court had risen to 19. On January 17, 2014, Freedom Industries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, requiring a court‚Äìappointed trustee to run the company. However, according to the Charleston Gazette, a company \\"whose characteristics are strikingly similar to Freedom Industries,\\" Lexycon LLC, registered as a business with the West Virginia secretary of state about two months after Freedom Industries filed for bankruptcy. The company is registered at the same addresses and phone numbers as the former Freedom Industries, and is founded by a former Freedom executive.David Gutman, \\"Freedom execs tied to new chemical company,\\" The Charleston Gazette, May 1, 2014 (accessed May 27, 2014)  Previous chemical accidents  Freedom Industries' release of crude MCHM into the Elk River was the third major chemical accident to occur in the Kanawha Valley in five years. In 2008, an explosion and fire occurred at a Bayer CropScience facility in Institute, killing two employees. In 2010, toxic gas was released at the DuPont facility in Belle. Following these incidents, a team of expert officials from the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) conducted investigations and contacted West Virginia state authorities in 2011 to establish a program to prevent chemical accidents and releases throughout the Kanawha River valley, known as \\"Chemical Valley\\" for its history of chemical processing, production, and resulting pollution. The CSB recommended that the safety program be headed by Dr. Rahul Gupta, the executive director for the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department. The West Virginia Legislature and West Virginia state government did not execute the CSB's recommendations.  Outcome  On January 14, five days after the chemical spill, leaders in both the West Virginia House of Delegates and the West Virginia Senate began investigating the loopholes that allowed the Freedom Industries facility in Charleston not to report the incident earlier. Senator John Unger, chairman of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on State Water Resources, proposed amending the current State Water Resources Management Plan. At the request of Governor Tomblin, DEP Secretary Randy Huffman began examining new methods of regulating similar chemical facilities. DEP is also examining the establishment of an inventory of similar facilities across West Virginia. On February 10, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives, held a field hearing in Charleston to investigate the circumstances behind, and the response to, the chemical spill.The Charleston, West Virginia, Chemical Spill: Field Hearing before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, Second Session, February 10, 2014 (Charleston, West Virginia) Further independent sampling On January 16, an independent unfunded engineering and science research team from the University of South Alabama drove more than 800 miles from Mobile, Alabama to help residents affected by the incident. The team was headed by Environmental Engineering Professors Dr. Andrew Whelton and Kevin White, and also included graduate students Keven Kelley, Matt Connell, Jeff Gill, and Lakia McMillan. The initial focus of their effort was to determine the impact of flushing on chemical levels in household drinking water as well as understand the reaction of the contaminated water with various household plumbing materials. When on the ground, the team found that many residents had not flushed their plumbing systems despite being given permission days before their arrival. Contaminated water remained in homeowner plumbing systems, leaving it to contact plumbing materials such as pipes, valves, gaskets, and joints. Homeowners they spoke with explained that they had refused to flush because of reports they heard from friends that odors caused by flushing could cause negative health impacts. Many homeowners stated no intention of flushing for the foreseeable future. In response, the research team modified the flushing protocol that was issued to homeowners and helped flush residences with these more health protective measures. Dr. Whelton's team then issued new guidance to the affected homeowners on how to conduct a plumbing system flush. On January 20, Dr. Whelton, his team, and the WV Clean Water Hub briefed the Governor Tomblin's Director of Communications about citizens not flushing after a press conference at the Capitol building. The number of residents that had not flushed their plumbing systems was unknown to the Governor's office. Results of the unfunded research team's efforts have been reported by several news outlets, including CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley, local CBS affiliate WOWK, Charleston Daily Mail, West Virginia Water Crisis Blog, New York Times, Mobile Press-Register, local NBC Affiliate WMPI, and The Huffington Post. Their testing continues and focuses on the public health and plumbing system degradation issues associated with contaminated drinking water. On December 16, 2014, the research team's completed paper regarding the residential tap water contamination in West Virginia was published in Environmental Science & Technology.Whelton et al. (December 16, 2014). \\"Residential Tap Water Contamination Following the Freedom Industries Chemical Spill: Perceptions, Water Quality, and Health Impacts\\" Retrieved January 14, 2015.

Early life  Moreland was born in Longview, Texas, the son of Robert Lloyd Moreland, an engineer, and Connie May Moreland (n√©e Brandon), a school librarian. Moreland's father worked for Sunoco as an electrical engineer, and because of this job the family moved a lot. His was a conservative Southern Baptist family. When he was a baby they moved to Northern Kentucky, across the river from Cincinnati, Ohio. Moreland credits his love for Cincinnati Reds to this time in Kentucky. When Moreland was 10 years old Moreland's family moved from Boone County, Kentucky to Tulsa, Oklahoma and, with the help of his father, he started playing the guitar. When he was 12 or 13 he started playing with a child he went to church with who wrote songs and inspired him to start writing songs.  Career  Moreland played in his first show when he was 13 or 14 years old. In the early 2000s during high school, Moreland played in local punk and hardcore bands, including local metalcore Oklahoma band, Thirty Called Arson. Moreland put together the Black Gold Band in 2005, and released Endless Oklahoma Sky on Oklahoma City label Little Mafia Records in 2008. In 2009, he recorded the follow-up Things I Can't Control at Armstrong Recording in Tulsa with producer and musician Stephen Egerton (Descendents, All). Largely self-performed and self-produced, Moreland produces music that is influenced by his Oklahoma roots, music that is \\"gloriously and joyfully heartbreaking.\\" Moreland has released a constant stream of records (in 2011 he released two full length albums and two EPs), saying \\"I write a lot of songs. And I guess I feel like your most recent release kind of represents you.\\" Moreland has cited Steve Earle as his \\"gateway\\" to folk music. He switched genres from hardcore to folk when he heard Earle's song \\"Rich Man's War\\". His father was also a big Earle fan. Other influences were Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt. Moreland runs his own mail order business and ships his own records (packing the records, taking them to the post office himself) because all of his favorite labels (Ebullition Records, Level Plane Records, Dischord Records) used that method. In 2015, Moreland released High on Tulsa Heat, his third full-length solo record release. It was produced by Moreland and features Jesse Aycock, John Calvin Abney, Chris Foster, Jared Tyler, and Kierston White. The album was recorded quickly and informally over the course of a few days in July 2014. Moreland used his parents' home in Bixby, Oklahoma, as a studio while they were out of town on vacation. A video of the song \\"Cherokee\\" was conceived and shot by Joey Kneiser, and features bass player Bingham Barnes. Both are from the band Glossary. Moreland said the song was inspired by a dream. Moreland participates in the Folk Alliance International Conference, a non-profit folk music conference that is held annually in Kansas City, Kansas. He participated in fellow singer-songwriter Jason Isbell's 2013 national tour. In 2017, Moreland released his seventh album, Big Bad Luv, on 4AD. The title is a nod to the book by that name by Larry Brown. The record is the first where Moreland recorded with a full band. Musicians from the bands Dawes (Griffin and Taylor Goldsmith) and Shovels And Rope (Carrie Ann Hearst and Michael Trent) contributed vocals. His fifth solo album, LP5, was released February 7, 2020. It's produced by Matt Pence of Centro-Matic and marks his return to the label Thirty Tigers, after his previous release via 4AD.  Performance style  John Moreland and the Black Gold Band Oklahoma City Conservancy (June 14, 2009) Moreland sometimes plays solo with an acoustic guitar, but was often accompanied by two different bands: the Black Gold Band (now defunct) or the Dust Bowl Souls. Though his earlier music was more rock-based, his more recent releases are characterized as being sparsely acoustic. He is characterized as a songwriter's songwriter. American television host and political commentator Rachel Maddow tweeted praise of Moreland's work: \\"If the American music business made any sense, guys like John Moreland would be household names.\\" Moreland posits that Maddow probably saw him opening for Lucero, a band Maddow likes. Moreland jokes that her remark was \\"the first time his dad has agreed with Rachel Maddow.\\" During the summer of 2015, Moreland opened for Jason Isbell, Dawes, and Patty Griffin.  Sons of Anarchy  Three of Moreland's songs, \\"Heaven\\", \\"Gospel\\", and \\"Your Spell\\", have been featured on the TV show, Sons of Anarchy.  Personal life  Moreland is married to visual artist Pearl Rachinsky, who did the album layout for Big Bad Luv. Around 2015, Moreland relocated to Norman, Oklahoma but then later that year moved back to Tulsa.

He was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He was born at Arley in Warwickshire. Wright had a brief first-class cricket career, but in one season, 1962, he was one of the leading wicket-takers in county cricket. He played for Warwickshire's second eleven from 1958 and made his first-class debut in nine games in the 1960 season, taking 21 wickets. There was an advance to 48 wickets from 17 matches in 1961, though they came at a cost of 32.52 runs per wicket, which was a high average for that period. In 1962, one of Warwickshire's most successful bowlers from the previous season, the off-spinner Basil Bridge, was restricted by illness to no more than a few games, and, in the absence of spin alternatives, the county regularly fielded three medium-pacers, Jack Bannister, Tom Cartwright and Wright as its main bowling attack. The move was quite successful as all three took more 100 wickets each and Warwickshire rose nine places to third in the County Championship, though Wisden Cricketers' Almanack took the view that lack of variety in the attack was the reason the county had not won the title. Wright, with 116 wickets at an average of 21.31, was the leading wicket-taker of the three and, said Wisden, \\"appeared the most dangerous and should improve\\". Virtually all of Wright's career-best bowling was done in this 1962 season. Against Gloucestershire at Edgbaston, he took five for 100 and six for 91 to achieve a match analysis of 11 for 191. He bettered this later in the season with five for 87 and six for 58 ‚Äì match figures of 11 for 145 ‚Äì in the game against Surrey, also at Edgbaston, and these were the best match and innings figures of his career. Wright's cricket career did not develop, however. In 1963, he was out of form and injured, and his tally of wickets dropped to 38; in no innings in the season did he take more three wickets. In 1964, he dropped out of the team and left the county staff at the end of the season, though he continued to play occasional second eleven matches through to 1969. In his last two seasons on the staff, he had played in one List A game in each year, without success. Wright's batting was consistently negligible: he passed 20 only twice in his entire first-class career. He generally batted at No 11, usually rising to No 10 only when Roly Thompson, a more senior rabbit, was in the team.

Price (born August 5, 1938) is the longest serving artistic director of a professional theatre in the United States. As the Executive Director of Goodspeed Musicals since 1968, he has produced more than 235 musicals, including 75 world premiers and transferred 19 productions to Broadway, including the world premieres of Shenandoah, Man of La Mancha and Annie. His productions have won 13 Tony Awards and 33 nominations. He has also accepted two special Tony Awards on Goodspeed's behalf. In 2019, he was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame.  Early life  Price was born on August 5, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois. He is the son of William and Sylvia Price, both of whom were Jewish. He was raised in a Jewish home in Chicago. He continues to strongly identify as a Jew and is active with a wide range of Jewish organizations. Price's first introduction to the theatre came from visiting family members who worked as actors. As a child, he acted in television commercials, including live commercials. He also learned from his uncle, a theatre manager in Chicago.  Education  Price received a B.A. from Michigan State University. He also received an M.A. from the University of Minnesota and a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) from the Yale School of Drama.  Early career in musical theatre  Early in his career, Price was a stagehand and electrician at the Shubert Theater in New Haven, Connecticut. He also served as Executive Producer of the 3,500-seat Valley Music Hall in Salt Lake City, Utah, the original stage manager for Richard Rodgers' Music Theater of Lincoln Center, and the production stage manager for Andy Williams, Henry Mancini and the Osmonds. As a lighting designer, he was responsible for the lighting at President Lyndon B. Johnson's Inaugural Gala, for Josephine Baker on Broadway and for the premiere American tour of the Hungarian National Ballet.  Goodspeed Musicals  Price first joined Goodspeed Musicals for the company's first season in 1963, but left after a year. In 1968, Price returned to Goodspeed as the theatre's Executive Director‚Äîa role he held until 2014‚Äîwith the goal of saving the then-struggling organization. Over his 45 years as Executive Director at Goodspeed, Price has produced more than 235 musicals, including 75 world premieres, and 19 Broadway productions. Price grew Goodspeed from a fledgling organization with only three full-time employees, a two-month season and a budget of less than $500,000 in his first season to a \\"musical-theater empire\\" with 65 year-round employees, a $12.5 million budget and a season lasting from April to December.

Areas affected by the tropical cyclone include Fiji and Tonga. In Tonga, Ian caused destruction in the Ha'apai islands, as well as one fatality. Meteorological history During January 2, 2014 the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi) reported that Tropical Disturbance 07F had developed to the southeast of Futuna Island. Over the next day the system gradually developed further underneath an upper level ridge of high pressure, within an area of moderate vertical wind shear, as it slowly moved towards the southwest. RSMC Nadi subsequently classified the disturbance as a tropical depression early on January 4, as the systems low level circulation center consolidated. Over the next day the system continued to move towards the southwest, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 07P late on January 5. At around this time RSMC Nadi named the system Ian, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Early on January 8, RSMC Nadi reported that Ian had become a category two tropical cyclone. During that day the systems organization significantly improved with RSMC Nadi reporting at 1800 UTC that Ian had become a category three severe tropical cyclone. Over the next day the system developed a cloud filled eye and intensified into a category 4 severe tropical cyclone. On January 12, as Ian started to weaken RSMC Nadi handed the primary warning responsibility, for issuing warnings over to the Wellington Tropical Cyclone Warning Center. Preparations and impact Cyclone Ian intensifying off Tonga on January 6 Late on January 10, a state of emergency was declared by Tongan Prime Minister Lord Tu'ivakano, after Ian intensified into a category five severe tropical cyclonehttp://matangitonga.to/2014/01/11/state-emergency-declared- vava%E2%80%98u-and-ha%E2%80%98apai with 287 km/h winds. It struck the Ha'apai islands the next day between Tongatapu and Vava'u, according to the Director of Emergencies Leveni Aho. He also said that 23 islands that are a part of Ha'apai were unreachable by telephone and that patrol boats were traveling from island-to-island to get information. As a result of the cyclone, homes were flattened and at least one person was dead. Ha'apai governor Tu'i Ha'angana said that he was able to see from one side of the island to the other and \\"that's how devastated it is.\\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia- pacific/2014/01/powerful-cyclone-rips-through-tonga- islands-201411264930152149.html By 13 January, contact with the islands was restored.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-13/an-tonga-monday/5196822 The electrical grid on Ha'apai sustained tremendous damage, with 90 percent of power lines being lost or severely damaged. Approximately 1,000 customers lost power during the storm. Estimates placed the cost to repair the system at NZ$4 million (US$3.5 million). By January 23, only 100 residences had power back and Tonga Power Limited (TPL) stated it could take a further two months to fully restore the system. In addition to the severe disruption to power, 80‚Äì90 percent of the region's water supply was lost. Most residents in Ha'apai rely on rain water collection, and the collection tanks were largely destroyed by the storm. The nation's tourism industry also experienced moderate to severe losses, with damage to facilities amounting to T$1.6 million (US$861,000). Throughout the archipelago, 1,130 buildings were affected, half of which were completely destroyed. Of those structures not destroyed, 34 percent sustained major damage, including 13 schools. Approximately 2,300 people were left homeless by the storm. Total damage from the storm amounted to an estimated T$90.2 million (US$48 million). Aftermath This church on Lifuka Island had its roof torn off by Cyclone Ian. In the wake of Ian, the ANZ bank donated T$15,000 (US$8,000) to the Tonga Red Cross Society. New Zealand provided NZ$2.27 million (US$1.87 million) in assistance to the TPL. In addition, six electricians, a front end loader, and a tractor were sent to assist in restoration and debris removal efforts. Australia provided A$50,000 in emergency supplies including blankets, water containers, tarpaulins, kitchen sets and hygiene kits. On January 22, the director of Tonga's National Emergency Office, Leveni Aho, announced that the scale of damage was beyond Tonga's ability to handle on its own and made a formal request for internal aid. Following this, China sent 400 tents to house displaced persons while France provided a cargo plane for supply transport. In accordance with the FRANZ agreement, enacted in 1992, the Government of France established an air route from Nuku'alofa to Ha'apai and deployed an aircraft carrier from New Caledonia. The carrier, loaded with supplies from the French Red Cross, arrived in Tonga on January 17. The Japanese Government provided 600 jerrycans and 30 water tanks (3,700 litre capacity), collectively worth ¬•13 million (US$127,000). Recovery from the cyclone is slow with over 80 families still living in tents over a year after the system had affected the islands.http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/266284/new-houses- for-tongan-cyclone-victims See also *Cyclone Hina *Cyclone Waka *Cyclone Percy *Cyclone Pam ReferencesExternal links Category:Tropical cyclones in Tonga Category:Tropical cyclones in Fiji Category:2013‚Äì14 South Pacific cyclone season Category:Category 5 South Pacific cyclones Category:Retired South Pacific cyclones Ian ","title":"Cyclone Ian"},{"id":"41607138","text":"Dying Gaul, Roman copy of a Hellenistic sculpture of a dying Galatian warrior, Capitoline Museums. The Galatians (; ; ) were a Gallic speaking Celtic people of the Hellenistic period that dwelt mainly in central Anatolia, in what was known as Galatia, in today's Turkey. In their origin they were a part of the great migration which invaded Macedon, led by Brennus. The originals who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios c. 278 BC. They consisted mainly of three tribes, the Tectosages, the Trocmii, and the Tolistobogii, but there were also other minor tribes. In 25 BC, Galatia became a province of the Roman Empire, with Ankara (Ancyra) as its capital. In the 1st century AD, many Galatians were Christianized by Paul the Apostle's missionary activities. The Epistle to the Galatians by Paul the Apostle is addressed to Galatian Christian communities and is preserved in the Bible (i.e. the New Testament).

Seeing something of a Hellenized savage in the Galatians, Francis Bacon and other Renaissance writers called them ('Gauls settled among the Greeks') and the country , as had the 3rd century AD Latin historian Justin.Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus, 25.2 and 26.2; the related subject of copulative compounds, where both are of equal weight, is exhaustively treated in Anna Granville Hatcher, Modern English Word-Formation and Neo-Latin: A Study of the Origins of English (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University), 1951. The more usual term was of Diodorus Siculus' Bibliotheca historica v.32.5, in a passage that is translated \\"...and were called Gallo- Graeci because of their connection with the Greeks\\", identifying Galatia in the Greek East as opposed to Gaul in the West.This distinction is remarked upon in William M. Ramsay (revised by Mark W. Wilson), Historical Commentary on Galatians 1997:302; Ramsay notes the 4th century AD Paphlagonian Themistius' usage . Brennus invaded Greece in 281 BC with a huge war band and was turned back before he could plunder the temple of Apollo at Delphi. At the same time, another Gaulish group of men, women, and children were migrating through Thrace. They had split off from Brennus' people in 279 BC, and had migrated into Thrace under their leaders Leonnorius and Lutarius. These invaders appeared in Asia Minor in 278‚Äì277 BC; others invaded Macedonia, killed the Ptolemaic ruler Ptolemy Ceraunus but were eventually ousted by Antigonus Gonatas, the grandson of the defeated Diadoch Antigonus the One- Eyed. During the course of the power struggle between Nikomedes I of Bithynia and his brother Zipoetes, the former hired 20,000 Galatian mercenaries. The Galatians split into two groups headed by Leonnorius and Lutarius, which crossed the Bosporus and the Hellespont respectively. In 277 BC, when the hostilities had ended the Galatians came out of Nikomedes' control and began raiding Greek cities in Asia Minor while Antiochus was solidifying his rule in Syria. The Galatians looted Cyzikus, Ilion, Didyma, Priene, Thyatira and Laodicea on the Lycus, while the citizens of Erythras paid them ransom. Either in 275 or 269 BC Antiochus' army faced the Galatians somewhere on the plain of Sardis in the Battle of Elephants. In the aftermath of the battle the Celts settled in northern Phrygia, a region that eventually came to be known as Galatia. The Seleucids build a series of forts at Thyatira, Akrasos and Nakrason and placed garrisons at Seleucia Sidera, Apamea, Antioch of Pisidia, Laodicea on the Lycus, Hierapolis, Peltos and Vlandos to limit Galatian raids. However the Galatians expanded beyond those borders taking control of important cities such as Ancyra (present day Ankara), Pessinus, Tavium, and Gordion. They launched further raids into Bithynia, Heracleia and the Pontus in both 255 and 250 BC. Either in 240 or 230 BC Attalus I inflicted a heavy defeat on the Galatians at the Battle of the Caecus River. In 216 BC, Prusias I of Bithynia intervened to protect the cities of the Hellespont from Galatian raids. In 190s BC, the Galatians raided Lampsacus and Heraclea Pontica. According to Memnon of Heraclea their goal was to gain access to the sea, however this claim is disputed by modern historiography. The constitution of the Galatian state is described by Strabo: comfortably to custom, each tribe was divided into cantons, each governed by a tetrarch with a judge under him, whose powers were unlimited except in cases of murder, which were tried before a council of 300 drawn from the twelve cantons and meeting at a holy place, twenty miles south-west of Ancyra, written in . It is likely it was a sacred oak grove, since the name means 'sanctuary of the oaks' in Gaulish: (from , lit. 'oak', and , lit. 'sacred ground'). The local population of Cappadocians were left in control of the towns and most of the land, paying tithes to their new overlords, who formed a military aristocracy and kept aloof in fortified farmsteads, surrounded by their bands. These Galatians were warriors, respected by Greeks and Romans (illustration, below). They were often hired as mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of the times. For years the chieftains and their war bands ravaged the western half of Asia Minor as allies of one or other of the warring princes without any serious check‚Äîuntil they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince Antiochus Hierax, who reigned in Asia Minor. Hierax tried to defeat Attalus I, the ruler of Pergamon (241‚Äì197 BC), but instead the Hellenized cities united under Attalus' banner and his armies inflicted several severe defeats upon Hierax and the Galatians in c. 232, forcing them to settle permanently and to confine themselves to the region to which they had already given their name. The theme of the Dying Gaul (a famous statue displayed in Pergamon) remained a favourite in Hellenistic art for a generation. Their right to the district was formally recognized. The king of Attalid Pergamon employed their services in the increasingly devastating wars of Asia Minor; another band deserted from their Egyptian overlord Ptolemy IV after a solar eclipse had broken their spirits. In 189 BC, Rome sent Gnaeus Manlius Vulso on an expedition against the Galatians, the Galatian War, defeating them. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BC onward. Galatia declined, at times falling under Pontic ascendancy. They were finally freed by the Mithridatic Wars, during which they supported Rome. In the settlement of 64 BC, Galatia became a client-state of the Roman empire, the old constitution disappeared, and three chiefs (wrongly styled 'tetrarchs') were appointed, one for each tribe. But this arrangement soon gave way before the ambition of one of these tetrarchs, Deiotarus, the contemporary of Cicero and Julius Caesar, who made himself master of the other two tetrarchies and was finally recognized by the Romans as 'king' of Galatia.

Life He was the son of Count Dietrich I of Wied (died about 1200), a follower of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in the Third Crusade. His brother Rudolf, Theoderich's uncle, was already elected Archbishop of Trier in 1183, however, he was denied by Pope Lucius III who favoured his rival Folmar of Karden. Theoderich began his ecclesiastical career about 1189; from about 1196, he served as provost of St. Kunibert's in Cologne, from 1205 also of Rees on the Lower Rhine. In 1210 he is documented as archdeacon at Trier and provost of St. Paulinus' Church. Elected archbishop upon the death of his predecessor John I on 15 July 1212, he soon entered into a fierce quarrel with the Rhenish count Henry II of Nassau over the erection of Montabaur Castle on the right bank of the Rhine. Henry had the fortress devastated and the archbishop arrested, nevertheless Theoderich was able to finish the construction two years later. Like his ancestors, he remained a loyal supporter of the Imperial House of Hohenstaufen, backing the young king Frederick II against his Welf rival Otto IV, which earned him the opposition of his counterparts in Cologne and Mainz. He also ensured the election of Frederick's son Henry (VII) as King of the Romans in 1220 and his coronation by Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne two years later. He remained a close confidant of the emperor, whom he accompanied to Italy and Sicily, and also of His son Henry (VII) until his rebellion in 1234. Theoderich also took care of his Trier principality. Under his rule construction was begun on the Liebfrauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) in approximately 1230 AD. He consecrated Limburg Cathedral in 1235 AD and also promoted the establishment of the Order of Saint John in Trier and of a Teutonic Order commandry in Koblenz (at the later Deutsches Eck). He acquired the Eifel estates around Malberg and had Kyllburg Castle erected about 1240. Theoderich was buried in the Cathedral of Trier.

Interior view to the top with high ceiling and arcs The great hall of Magna Plaza. Decorations during the coronation of king Willem- Alexander of the Netherlands The Former Amsterdam Main Post Office, currently a shopping mall known as Magna Plaza, is a monumental building located at Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 182, Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was built in 1895‚Äì1899 in Neo-Gothic and Neo-Renaissance style. The building has been a rijksmonument since July 9, 1974, and is part of the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites. Description at monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl, official website for Dutch cultural heritage  History  The Amsterdam Post Office was built in the period 1895‚Äì1899, designed by Cornelis Peters. It replaced the Royal Post Office of 1854, which was designed by Frederik Willem Conrad and Cornelis Outshoorn, which served as a gallery shortly before being taken down in 1897.  Exterior  The exterior is heavily decorated with polychromatic brick with details in dressed stone, including framing for all windows and doors. Across the roof edges are a large number of dormers, each with their own crow-stepped gable. Due to the pear shaped crowns on top of the towers the building is colloquially named ‚ÄòPerenburg‚Äô (English: pearburg).  Interior  The building's interior consists of a central hall with galleries on two upper floors, surrounded by arcades and crowned by a sunroof. The public function of the building was limited to the ground floor, while the rest of the building was only accessible to personnel of the PTT. In 1987, the PTT announced that it intended to vacate the building and it was sold the next year for ∆í 7,5 million (about ‚Ç¨3,2 million) to Larmag, a Swedish real estate developer, who intended to repurpose the building as a luxurious shopping mall. Maintaining and optimally using the monumental building was a main criterion. The construction started in February 1991. The exterior work was mostly limited to cleaning, repair and restoration of the facades. The interior of the building was completely rebuilt, maintaining the carrying structures and decorative elements.  Renovation and shopping mall  Unexpected technical problems delayed the work; the building's foundation had to be replaced, and several of the beams were found to be hollow. The floors of the new mall were connected by escalators and elevators. The existing stairways were maintained; two as emergency stairways and one as a public stairway. Office spaces were created in the attic. The renovation was led by H. Ruijssenaars. The shopping mall Magna Plaza, named after Larmag's CEO Lars-Erik Magnusson, was finally opened to the public on August 17, 1992.

A category-C listed building, it is situated in the Highland council area, east of the village of Plockton on the south shore of Loch Carron. The castle was built in 1866 for Alexander Matheson, a Scottish businessman and Member of Parliament. It was built in the Scottish Baronial style, to designs by Alexander Ross. It remained in the Matheson family until the 1920s, when it was sold to Sir Daniel Hamilton and his wife, who owned the neighbouring estate. The Hamiltons intended to use the castle for educational purposes in the local community, but this never came to fruition and following the outbreak of World War II the castle was used as a naval hospital. By the end of the war the Hamiltons had died, and the castle was bequeathed to the local council, which converted it for use as a home economics college for girls, operating until its closure in 1989. After standing derelict for more than a decade, the castle was bought by the Dobson family of England in 2002, seventeen of whom moved in. Faced with huge renovation costs, the family had several disputes, and sold their story to a television company, who produced a five-part series which aired on BBC1. In 2009, after most of the family had moved away, the Dobsons sold the castle. It was bought with the intention of converting it to a bed and breakfast, which operated for two years but then closed, as the castle remained in need of major renovation. As of 2020 it remains closed, having not been open for almost a decade. The castle is served by Duncraig railway station, on the Kyle of Lochalsh line. This was originally opened in 1897 as a private station, and is now open to the public. Description Duncraig Castle is located on Loch Carron, part of the west coast of Scotland, in the Highlands. It is on the northern shore of the Lochalsh peninsula, to the north-east of the town of Kyle of Lochalsh and the Isle of Skye. It is close to the village of Plockton. The castle is served by the Duncraig railway station, which is on the Kyle of Lochalsh line from Inverness.GB eNRT May 2016 Edition, Table 239 (Network Rail) The three-storey building was constructed in the Scottish baronial style, and has an asymmetrical nine-bay layout with gables and crenellations. The building has eighty rooms including a large dining room, and features a chapel as well as an octagonal water tower and a large modern extension. It has been designated as a category C listed building since 1982. The castle's estate consists of of land, much of it forest, as well as a boathouse and two private islands. The castle is operated as a bed and breakfast (B&B;) as well as being the home of the owner and her family, although as of 2020 the B&B; is yet to reopen following extensive renovation work. The castle is served by Duncraig railway station, which is unstaffed and operated by Abellio ScotRail, lying between Stromeferry and Plockton on the Kyle of Lochalsh line. The station features a single concrete platform and an unusual hexagonal shelter with pyramid-shaped roof. The station received a category-B listing in 1997. History Duncraig Castle was built in 1866 by Sir Alexander Matheson, who had returned to Britain after making a large sum of money through the Chinese opium trade, as a country home suitable for hosting large gatherings. The building is located close to the Mathesons' family seat at Attadale, and was designed by the architect Alexander Ross. Matheson died in 1886 and the castle initially remained with his family, who rented it to wealthy tenants continuing its use as a hosting venue for summer entertainment. In 1897, the Highland Railway built the Kyle of Lochalsh Extension to their existing line to Stromeferry, which included a dedicated station for Duncraig Castle. Named Duncraig railway station, it was initially a private-use only station for the Matheson family, but was later opened for public use. By the 1920s the Matheson family were in financial difficulty and they sold the castle to Sir Daniel Hamilton and his wife Lady Hamilton, owners of the neighbouring Balmacara Estate. The Hamiltons, supporters of social reform, planned to use the castle as a community education centre, for local people to receive training in activities such as weaving. In 1938 the local authority began discussions with the Hamiltons about using the castle for education purposes, but these did not come to fruition before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Sir Daniel Hamilton died during the early stages of the war, and the castle was used during the hostilities by the government, as a naval hospital. By the end of the war, Lady Hamilton had also died and the castle was bequeathed to Inverness-shire council, for use as a community facility for the Highlands. The building was operated by the education authority as a home economics college for girls. A wing was added in modernist style in 1969, and the council made other alterations such as the removal of fireplaces and installation of a central heating system throughout the building. The college closed in 1989 and the building remained empty and neglected for the next fourteen years, apart from a period in the mid-1990s during which it was used for the filming of the BBC comedy-mystery-drama Hamish Macbeth. In 2002, the castle was bought by Sam and Perlin Dobson, a couple who ran a business in Nottingham. Seventeen members of the Dobsons' extended family moved into the castle in the summer of 2003, including Sam and Perlin's daughter as well as Sam's parents and three of his siblings, each bringing their own spouses and children, leaving jobs in England and occupying a different wing of the castle. The castle was in need of major renovation at the time, with none of its bathrooms operational and several collapsed ceilings, and the Dobsons found they had to spend large sums of money and devote much of their time to repair work. This burden, coupled with the difficulty of living in a derelict building through the winter months, caused increasing disputes amongst the family. They decided to sell their story to a television company, which filmed the family's lives during their first year in the castle and produced a five- part reality television series called The Dobsons of Duncraig, which aired on BBC1 from December 2004. The stress and financial pressures of renovating the castle took its toll on the family and by 2008 only Sam and Perlin's family were still residing there, after the other siblings had left, and Sam's parents evicted following a court order. In 2009 the Dobsons decided to sell the castle and move on. The castle was bought from the Dobson family by Suzanne Hazeldine, who began operating a bed and breakfast (B&B;) in the castle. After opening and running the B&B; operations in the existing building for two years, she closed the castle in 2010 to renovate and convert it into luxury accommodation. The work was still in progress in 2016, when Hazeldine informed The Press and Journal newspaper that she had given the building a \\"complete overhaul\\". The reopening was planned at the time for the spring of 2017, but as of 2020 it has still not reopened, its website declaring that it is due to open in spring 2020.

As a portfolio manager at S.A.C. Capital Advisors, he was accused of generating possibly the largest single insider trading transaction profit in history at a value of $276 million. A jury convicted him, and in November 2014 he began serving a nine-year prison sentence. He is currently incarcerated at FCI Miami as inmate 01138-104, and scheduled for early release on 19 July 2021. Early life Martoma was born in Michigan and grew up in Merritt Island, Florida. His mother, Lizzie, is a doctor and his father, Bobby (formerly Cochukattil Thomas), owns a dry cleaning and laundry company. Both are immigrants from India. He graduated from Merritt Island High School in 1992. He graduated from Duke University and then attended Harvard Law School but was expelled in 1999 for grade manipulation and dishonesty. He had used computer software to create a fake transcript with better grades which he then sent to federal judges in an attempt to secure a clerkship. After leaving Harvard, he legally changed his name from Ajai Mathew Thomas to Mathew Cochukattil Martoma in 2001. He then applied and was accepted to Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he received an MBA in 2003. After Martoma's trial, where it was revealed that he had been expelled from Harvard but did not disclose that to Stanford, Stanford took back his degree for being admitted under false pretenses. Martoma worked as a portfolio manager at S.A.C. Capital Advisors. He was hired in 2006 after working for three years at Sirios Capital Management. Martoma owned a $2 million mansion in Boca Raton. This residence was forfeited as part of Martoma's sentencing. Trial According to the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, Martoma allegedly advised Steven A. Cohen to sell shares of pharmaceutical companies Wyeth and Elan Corporation based on tips from two doctors, including Sid Gilman of the University of Michigan, about the Alzheimer's disease drug bapineuzumab during clinical trials overseen by the FDA. Martoma pleaded not guilty to formal charges of securities fraud, two counts, and conspiracy which resulted in $276 million in profits for SAC Capital in 2008. The insider trading trial began on January 9, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. A jury of seven women and five men were selected to evaluate the evidence in a courtroom presided by U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe. On February 6, 2014, Martoma was found guilty on all charges. On September 8, 2014, Martoma was sentenced to 9 years in prison. In addition Martoma must forfeit his $9.38 million bonus which he earned in 2008. In August 2017, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the conviction.. In June 2018, the again divided panel issued an amended opinion reaching the same result. On June 3, 2019, the Supreme Court declined to hear Martoma's case, leaving his sentence in place. Personal life Martoma is married to Dr. Rosemary A. Martoma (n√©e Kurian), a pediatrician; the couple have three children.

Nanjing was the name for modern Beijing during the Liao dynasty, when Khitan rulers made the city the southern capital. To distinguish Nanjing, which literally means \\"Southern Capital\\" in Chinese, from modern Nanjing in Jiangsu Province and Beijing Damingfu, the Northern Song Dynasty name for modern Daming County in Hebei Province, Chinese historians sometimes refer to Beijing during the Liao dynasty as Liao Nanjing (). The Khitan rulers of the Liao acquired the city, then known as Youzhou, in the cession of the Sixteen Prefectures in 938 from the Later J√¨n, one of the five shortlived dynasties that ruled northern China following the end of the Tang Dynasty. The city was officially renamed Nanjing, Youdu Fu (Âçó‰∫¨ÂπΩÈÉΩÂ∫ú). In 1012, the city was renamed Nanjing, Xijin Fu (Âçó‰∫¨ÊûêÊ¥•Â∫ú). The city was also colloquially referred to at the time as Yanjing. In 1122, the city was captured by the Jurchen Jin dynasty and was officially renamed Yanjing, ending the use of Nanjing for what is today modern Beijing.

The outer city wall was 36 li in circumference, though some scholars say it was closer to 25-27 li, 9 meters high and 4.5 meters wide at the top. The city had eight gates (men), two each in each cardinal direction: Andongmen and Yingchunmen to the east, Kaiyangmen and Danfengmen to the south, Xianximen and Qingpumen to the west, and Tongtianmen and Gongchenmen to the north. On top of the wall were 910 battle towers. Outside the wall were three layers of moats. Outside Danfengmen was the jiju grounds, where Khitan nobles played an ancient form of polo. A minaret in the Niujie Mosque, founded in 996, is now the oldest mosque in Beijing. Inside the southwest corner of the outer walled city was a rectangular inner walled city, which during the Tang era served as the headquarters of the Lulong commander. \\"ËæΩÂçó‰∫¨ÔºàÁáï‰∫¨ÔºâÁöáÂüé\\" 2002-12-1 The Liao converted this inner city into a walled imperial place, which had four gates. To the south and west, imperial walled city shared gates with the outer walled city, Xianximen and Danfengmen. The north gate of the imperial city was Yabeimen and east gate was Xuanhemen. In keeping with Khitan tradition which orients toward the east, the main gate of the imperial city was Xuanhemen. On top of the Xuanhemen was the Pavilion of Five Phoenix (Wufenglou). From the pavilion, the Khitan ruler could gaze out at the cityscape to the east. Outside of this gate was the Minzhong Temple, now the Fayuan Temple, the oldest in Beijing. The north wall stretched from the modern day White Cloud Temple east along Toufa Hutong (Hair Lane). ‰æØÊôìÊô®, \\"Âåó‰∫¨ÁöÑËæΩ‰ª£Âè§ÂüéÈÅóËøπ:ËæΩÂÆãÂ§ßÊàòÁöÑÈ´òÁ≤±Ê≤≥(Âõæ)\\" [3] Âåó‰∫¨ÈùíÂπ¥Êä• 2009-08-06 Shoushui Hutong, the lane adjacent to Toufa Hutong to the north, once called the Stinking Water River, was likely Liao Nanjing's moat. The east wall was situated just west of Lanman Hutong, which was itself the eastern moat. The Fayuan Temple, some 200 meters west of Lanman Hutong, was encompassed inside the wall. A stone tablet near Caishikou marks the location of Andongmen, the north gate in the east wall. The south wall was located roughly along modern-day Baizhifang Street. A stone tablet at the intersection of Baizhifang Street and You'anmen Inner Street marks the site of Kaiyangmen, the east gate in the south wall. The west wall extended from the White Cloud Temple to the Xiaohongmiao neighborhood, to the east of the Lianhua River, which functioned as the west moat.(Chinese) ‰æØÊôìÊô®, \\"Âåó‰∫¨ÁöÑËæΩ‰ª£Âè§ÂüéÈÅóËøπ:ËæΩÂÆãÂ§ßÊàòÁöÑÈ´òÁ≤±Ê≤≥(Âõæ)\\" [2] Âåó‰∫¨ÈùíÂπ¥Êä• 2009-08-06 Liao Nanjing retained the 26 neighborhood division of the Tang city. The major markets were to the northern part of the city. =Imperial city= Liao-era furniture from the uncovered in Fangshan District. Inside the imperial city was the palace complex, which in keeping with Han Chinese tradition, faced the south. The palace complex, like the later Forbidden City, had two internal gates facing the south, Xuanjiaomen and Nanduanmen (which were renamed, respectively, Yuanhemen and Qixiamen in 1006). To the east and west were the Zuoyemen and Youyemen, which were renamed Wanchunmen and Qianqiumen in 1006. The palace was located on the same site where Shi Siming had built his palace when he declared himself emperor in 759, during the An-Shi Rebellion. Halls in the palace include the Yurong, Xuanhe, Danei and Yongping. =Houses of worship= The city had numerous temples including the Minzhong, Yanshou and Wutian. Among those that survive to this day are the Minzhong Temple, now known as the Fayuan Temple, the oldest Buddhist Temple in Beijing; the Tianning Temple whose pagoda, built in the Liao era, is among the oldest buildings standing in Beijing; the Daoist White Cloud Temple; and the Niujie Mosque, founded in 996 by Nazaruddin, an Arab resident, and now the oldest mosque in Beijing. History Khitans were a nomadic people from Inner Mongolia. Painting of Khitan hunters by Hu Gui from the Five Dynasties. Prior to its cession to the Liao in 938, Youzhou had been regional center in northern China for two millennia. The city, known in earlier eras as Ji, was the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan, and became under the Tang dynasty an important military command to guard the northern frontier against the Khitan and Xi. After the fall of the Tang in 907, the Khitan leader Yel√º Abaoji declared himself emperor in Shangjing (modern-day Baarin Left Banner, Inner Mongolia) in 918 and began to expand southward. In 936, his son, Yel√º Deguang renamed their dynasty, Liao, and in 938 helped Shi Jingtang, a Shatuo Turk general overthrow the Later Tang dynasty and found the Later J√¨n dynasty. In exchange for Liao military assistance, Shi Jingtang ceded the Sixteen Prefectures along the Great Wall to the Liao. The Liao then made the two principal cities acquired, Youzhou (modern Beijing) and Yunzhou (modern Datong), the Southern and Western Capitals of its growing empire. Liao Nanjing administered the empire‚Äôs Southern Circuit, which includes predominantly ethnic Han territory south of the Taihang Mountains. Under Liao rule, the population inside the walled city grew from 22,000 in 938 to 150,000 in 1113 (and the population of the surrounding region grew from 100,000 to 583,000) as large numbers of Khitan, Xi, Shiwei and Balhae from the north and Han from the south migrated to the city. = War and peace with the Song = After unifying the rest of China in 960, the Song dynasty sought to recapture the lost northern territories. In 979, the Song emperor Taizong personally led a military expedition that reached and laid siege to Nanjing (Youzhou) but was defeated in the decisive Battle of Gaoliang River, north of the city. In 1004, the Song and Liao signed the Treaty of Chanyuan, and remained at peace for more than a century. =Fall of Liao Nanjing= In 1120, the Song entered the Alliance on the Sea with the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) of the Jurchens, a semi-agricultural, forest-dwelling people living northeast of the Liao in modern-day northeast China. The Song and Jin agreed to jointly invade the Liao and split captured territories, with most of the Sixteen Prefectures going to the Song.Mote 1999: 208 Under the leadership of Wanyan Aguda, the founder of the Jin dynasty, the Jurchens captured in rapid succession, Shangjing, Zhongjing and Dongjing, the Liao's Upper, Central and Eastern Capitals.(Chinese) „Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩÂéÜÂè≤ÂéÜÂπ¥Â§ß‰∫ãËÆ∞„Äã\\"ÂåóÂÆãÔºèËæΩ - ÂÆ£Âíå‰∫åÂπ¥ ÂÖ¨ÂÖÉ1120Âπ¥ Â∫öÂ≠ê\\" Accessed 2014-01-08 In the spring of 1122, the Liao court rallied around Prince Yel√º Chun and made him emperor in Nanjing. Yel√º Chun rebuffed the Song appeals to surrender. In May, the Song commander Tong Guan sent two armies to capture Nanjing, but Zhong Shidao's eastern army was defeated by Yel√º Dashi at Baigou (in Rongcheng County, Hebei) and Xin Xingzong's western army was driven back by Xiao Gan at Fancun (in modern Zhuozhou, Hebei). After Yel√º Chun died of illness in the early summer, the Empress Dowager Xiao Defei assumed leadership, and Tong Guan sent Liu Yanqing to attack Nanjing in September with 150,000 troops. Gao Feng and Guo Yaoshi, the Liao commanders of Yizhou and Zhuozhou surrendered their respective cities. Guo Yaoshi then led the vanguard of the Song Army in a raid on Nanjing.(Chinese) „Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩÂéÜÂè≤ÂéÜÂπ¥Â§ß‰∫ãËÆ∞„Äã\\"ÂåóÂÆãÔºèËæΩ - ÂÆ£ÂíåÂõõÂπ¥ ÂÖ¨ÂÖÉ1122Âπ¥ Â£¨ÂØÖ\\" Accessed 2014-01-08 He sent subordinate Zhen Wuchen with fifty soldiers dressed as city residents to seize and open the Yingchunmen. Guo Yaoshi and the rest of the raiders entered the city, seized the Minzhong Temple and then managed to control seven of the city's eight gates. Empress Xiao refused to surrender or flee. She sent for reinforcements and continued to resist from the imperial city, firing arrows from atop Xuanhemen. After three days of street fighting, Xiao Gan's Four Armies, so called because it consisted of armies of Khitan, Xi, Han and Balhae troops, reached the city, ahead of the main Song Army. They slipped into the city through the Danfengmen, the only gate of the outer walled city not controlled by the Song troops. According to Song battlefield accounts, that gate was not open to the public and overlooked by the raiders. Xiao Gan's reinforcements then emerged from the north and east gates of the imperial city and surprised Guo Yaoshi's who were busy looting while waiting for the main Song Army to arrive. After heavy fighting in the markets in the north of the city, the Song raiders were defeated and trapped. Guo Yaoshi fled by lowering himself from the city wall. Of the 7,000 Song raiders who attacked the city, only 400 managed to escape. Xiao Gan then routed Liu Yanqing's main Song Army. In the winter of 1122, the Jin Army drove through the Juyong Pass and marched on Nanjing from the north. This time, Empress Xiao fled to the steppes and the remaining Liao officials capitulated. Wanyan Aguda allowed the surrendering officials to retain their positions and encouraged refugees to return to the city, which was renamed Yanjing. =Song Yanshan= In the spring of 1123, Wanyan Aguda agreed, as per treaty terms, to hand Yanjing and four other prefectures to the Song in exchange for tribute. The handover occurred after the Jurchens had looted the city's wealth and forced all officials and craftsman to move to the Jin capital at Shangjing (near present-day Harbin).(Chinese) \\"ÂåóÂÆãÔºèËæΩ - ÂÆ£Âíå‰∫îÂπ¥ ÂÖ¨ÂÖÉ1123Âπ¥ Áô∏ÂçØ\\" Accessed 2014-01-08 Thus, the Song, having failed to take the city militarily from the Khitans, managed to purchase Yanjing from the Jurchens.Mote 1999: 209 Song rule of the city, renamed Yanshan (ÁáïÂ±±), was short-lived. As the convoy of relocated Nanjing residents passed Pingzhou (near Qinhuangdao) on their way to the Northeast, they persuaded the governor Zhang Jue to restore them to their home town. Zhang Jue, a former Liao official who had surrendered to the Jin dynasty, then switched his allegiance to the Song. The Song Emperor Huizong welcomed his defection, ignoring warnings from his diplomats that the Jurchens would regard the acceptance of defectors as a breach of treaty terms. Zhang Jue was defeated by the Jurchens, and took refuge with Guo Yaoshi at Yanshan. The Song court had Zhang Jue executed to satisfy Jin demands, much to the alarm of Guo Yaoshi and other former Liao officials serving the Song. The Jurchens, sensing Song weakness, used the Zhang Jue incident as a pretext to invade. In 1125, Jin forces defeated Guo Yaoshi at the Battle of the Bai River, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River in modern Miyun County. \\"ÂåóÂÆãÔºèËæΩ - ÂÆ£Âíå‰∏ÉÂπ¥ ÂÖ¨ÂÖÉ1125Âπ¥ ‰πôÂ∑≥\\" Accessed 2014-01-08 Guo Yaoshi then surrendered Yanshan and then guided the Jin's rapid advance on the Song capital, Kaifeng, where the Song Emperor was captured in 1127, ending the Northern Song dynasty. Yanshan was renamed Yanjing. A Liao- era memorial tablet found in the tomb of Li Jicheng, an official in Nanjing, and his wife. The tablet was unearthed in Fengtai District in 2002.  Conversion into Jin Zhongdu  In 1151, the Jin dynasty moved its capital from Shangjing to Yanjing, renaming the city, Zhongdu. The Jurchens expanded the city to the west, east and south. Liao Nanjing's northern wall was extended to the east and west with Tongtianmen renamed Tongxuanmen and Gongchenmen renamed Chongzhimen.

In the mid 1930s, the state embarked on a program of removing dangerous grade crossings where major routes crossed railroad tracks. In 1938, it awarded a contract to S. M. Dixon to build an overpass at the crossing of US 79 and the St. Louis Southwestern Railway line. Dixon built a section of concrete roadway, wide, with a concrete deck girder bridge to cross the tracks.

The film stars Arya's younger brother Sathya and Miya. The movie features a successful soundtrack composed by Ghibran. It opened to mixed reviews in September 2014. The film was remade in Bengali in 2020 as Love Story.  Plot  The movie begins with Jeeva (Sathya) being taken to court, where he recalls his past. In 1989, at the beginning of his 12th standard, his friend Balaji (Ananth Nag) falls in love with their classmate Karthika (Miya). Jeeva talks to Karthika but comes to know that she is actually in love with him. The next day, he accepts her love. Jeeva's father died when he was young, and his mother (Rindhuravi) married again. Once when Jeeva and Karthika are out, they are caught by police, and both their families are informed. Later, when Jeeva goes to apologize to Karthika's parents, he is hit by her father (Vaidyanathan). Meanwhile, Karthika's father applies for a transfer. Jeeva and Karthika promise that they will not meet until their last exam. On the last day, Karthika leaves but gives a letter to Balaji and tells him to give it to Jeeva, but Balaji does not give it and tries to convince Jeeva that Karthika does not love him anymore. Jeeva and Karthika try to meet each other but in vain. Finally, Jeeva learns Karthika's whereabouts, and they finally meet. When he meets her, he lands up in a fight with her friend. He goes to her home and asks her if she still loves him. She says no but later feels she should talk to him and marry him the way he asked her as proof, but fate has other plans. The next day when she meets him, he stabs her before she can say anything and later realizes she is still in love with him. He tries to save her, but she dies in his arms. The scene returns to the present, where Jeeva escapes from the police to find Karthika's grave, then he jumps off a cliff. The movie ends with Jeeva and Karthika united in heaven and their names written on the bark of the tree by Jeeva when they first met.

Madhan of Escape Artistes Motion Pictures was to produce the film, while Yuvan Shankar Raja was announced as the music composer. Adharvaa was announced to play the lead role but consequently opted out during pre-production stages, and the production house dropped the film. Jeeva Shankar replaced him with Sathya in September 2013 with Sathya's brother, Arya producing the film under his production house, The Show People. Malayalam actress Miya was signed to play the female lead role, making her debut in Tamil films. The film began production in October 2012 in Ooty, with costume designer Sai preparing clothes for the film's 1980s backdrop. Mia said that she played a school girl named Karthika in the film, a \\"very cute character\\", going on to add that she had to act in a lot of emotional scenes and that she would be seen mostly in the school uniform costume and the half saree. She had shot for 45 days in Ooty, with most of her scenes being shot in a set. Sathya played a school boy named Jeeva, a character that required him to shed more than 10 kg, with the actor stating that the film was an \\"intense love story...on the lines of Kaadhal Kondein (2003), 7G Rainbow Colony (2004), and Kaadhal (2004)\\".  Soundtrack  The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Ghibran. The soundtrack album features six tracks, with lyrics written by Madhan Karky, Parvathy, P. Vetriselvan and Asmin. The album was released at Sathyam Cinemas on 28 June 2014 by actresses Trisha Krishnan and Nayantara while director Bala and actresses Pooja Umashankar, Lekha Washington and, Rupa Manjari were also present. Jeeva Shankar stated that he told Ghibran that he wanted five melodious songs \\"that capture the spirit of young romance\\". Since the film was set in 1988‚Äì89, the director had wanted an 80s feel to the songs but Ghibran suggested a more contemporary sound, which, he felt, would appeal to modern- day audiences. Ghibran stated that there would be \\"subtle references\\" to the music of the period the film is set in, especially in the use of instruments. He also says he has used music bridges as the director had not placed any restriction on the length of the songs. Barring K. S. Chitra, no 80s singers sang the songs as the voices had to match the two young leads, with Ghibran adding that, since the film was about the journey of the two characters, the voices \\"mature as the film progresses\\". The album received high praise from critics. The Times of India wrote, \\"This is an album that you will instantly take to and it is only going to grow on you even better, especially if you are in love. It is sure to figure in the Top 5 of the year's best film album\\". Behindwoods have 3.25 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Ghibran showcases poise, proficiency and pure melodies in this soul-stirring album\\". Indiaglitz.com wrote, \\"Ghibran is on a roll. What's so good to see is, the tunes let the lyrics to dominate and the freedom he gives to the singers to be imaginative. With this album he has gone a step further from being a bankable music director to a star composer. Like the title, the album will be remembered as an 'epic' in the years to come\\". musicaloud.com gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"His Telugu debut may not have been up to his usual standards, but with Amara Kaaviyam, Ghibran continues to churn out top quality work in Tamil\\". Sify wrote, \\"Ghibran shoulders the movie by delivering his career best soundtrack and his re-recording is very refreshing too\\".  Release  The satellite rights of the film were sold to STAR Vijay.  Critical reception  The film received mixed reviews from critics. Sify wrote that \\"the movie moves at snail pace and the second half of the movie wanders aimlessly before convoluting in a tragic climax. Had the director tweaked his screenplay a little and had made it tight, Amara Kaaviyam would have lived up to its title\\". Behindwoods rated the film 2.75 out of 5 and noted that \\"Amara Kaviyam has brilliant music, great visuals, good acting, wish it had left little more impact\\". The Hindu noted that \\"Amara Kaaviyam, though fleetingly good, isn‚Äôt the thriller that it should have been, and isn‚Äôt the romance it intended to be\\". Rediff wrote \\"Director Jeeva Sankar has attempted to portray an intense love story and he does succeed to some extent\\".

It was a serialized competition that followed three Michelin star chefs becoming mentors, as they return to their old catering colleges to select and train a prot√©g√©. Each chef has an initial group of seven student candidates and over the course of the series must eliminate less able candidates until they choose the one who will become their prot√©g√©. The climax of the series is a head to head competition of all three prot√©g√©s where they cook for the chef's own mentors, who will judge them not only their skills as a chef, but also by how well they are able to represent their mentor's style and philosophy of cooking. Chefs and mentors The three chefs and their mentors who appear in the program are: * Tom Kitchin, the head chef of the one Michelin star restaurant The Kitchin who was mentored by Pierre Koffman at La Tante Claire. * Theo Randall, the head chef of Theo Randall at the InterContinental and former holder of one Michelin star at The River Caf√© in London where he was mentored by Ruth Rogers before becoming its head chef. Randall was also mentored at the same establishment by Rose Gray, who died before the series was commissioned. * Michel Roux, Jr., the head chef of the two Michelin star restaurant Le Gavroche, who was mentored by his father Albert Roux at the same restaurant before becoming its head chef. Colleges The three colleges featured are: *Perth College, where Tom Kitchin studied. *Brooklands College, where Theo Randall studied. *University College Birmingham. While Michel Roux, Jr. did not attend this college himself, the Roux family have strong ties to the college. Episodes The series consists of twenty episodes, initially broadcast on consecutive weekday evenings over four weeks. Each of the first three weeks focused on a different chef each week reducing their initial seven candidates down to two semi- finalists with Kitchin appearing in the first week, Randall in the second week and Roux in the third. The final week had the semi finalists compete for the place as each chef's prot√©g√© over the first three nights in the same order as the opening weeks. The penultimate night is devoted to the proteges cooking a three course menu for their mentor of which two dishes were selected to go forward, after feedback to improve them by their mentor, to the final night for judging by the chef's mentors themselves. Winner The competition was won by Jamie MacKinnon, Tom Kitchin's prot√©g√©, who scored forty points from the chef's mentors, beating the prot√©g√©s of Theo Randall and Michel Roux, Jr. who scored thirty six points each.

It includes ten contributing buildings (of eleven within its boundaries) lining Arkansas Highway 8, just north of its junction with Farm Market and Banks Roads. At the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001, all of these buildings, built between c. 1898 and 1940, stood vacant, reflecting the decline of the area. New Edinburg has never had a population more than 200. At its height, the center of the town included six general stores, a cafe, a hotel, a blacksmith, and an automotive service garage. The hotel was built c. 1879, and served as such until 1910, when it was converted to a residence. The blacksmithy is a utilitarian wood frame building with a metal roof, built c. 1936, which was used by two blacksmiths. The service station was built of similar materials in 1940, and (as of 2001) housed the local volunteer fire department. The cafe building dates to about 1928, but does not contribute to the district because of significant modifications to its facade in 2000. Of the general stores, the Parrot Grocery Store is one of the oldest buildings in the district. It was supposedly used as a Methodist church before being moved to its present location c. 1900 and converted to retail use. Like most of the other stores, it is clad in weatherboard, with a metal gable roof. Two of the stores, the Hamaker-Hearnsberger Store and the Parham Store (both c. 1920), retain elements of car canopies on their fronts; the latter also originally had gasoline pumps. There is one residential house in the district, a brick- sheathed frame building built c. 1948.

It is located north of Metro Manila along the North Luzon Expressway. The site where it is located used to be a farmland and was converted and being developed into a mixed-use area that will integrate residential and office buildings as well as shopping, entertainment, leisure, education, business and sports complex. It is owned by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a Filipino-based indigenous Christian religious organization, through its educational institution, the New Era University, and operated by Maligaya Development Corporation. It was inaugurated on July 21, 2014 in commemoration of INC's centennial celebration on July 27, 2014. History On August 17, 2011, the Iglesia Ni Cristo executive minister Eduardo Manalo led the groundbreaking of the Philippine Arena, a 55,000-seater indoor domed arena, and other infrastructures in the complex. After three years of construction, on July 21, 2014, Philippine president Benigno Aquino III and INC executive minister Eduardo Manalo led the inauguration of the Ciudad de Victoria on time for the INC centennial celebration on July 27, 2014. During the COVID-19 pandemic, three tents near the Philippine Arena were set up as isolation facilities for COVID-19 patients. Developments The first phase development includes the Philippine Arena, which is currently the largest indoor arena in the Philippines, in Asia and in the world with a seating capacity of 55,000; The largest stadium in the Philippines with 20,000-seater Philippine Sports Stadium; The two-hectare Sports Center, an indoor aquatic and tennis center the first in Northern Luzon; and the initial four phases of residential developments. The second phase development includes the Era√±o G. Manalo (EGM) Medical Center, an 11-storey 1st class modern hospital which is the first of its kind in Northern Luzon with 1,000-bed capacity; the New Era University Bocaue Campus, with specialization in sports science, architecture and medical education; and the phase also include additional hotels & residential developments. On May 18, 2018 an Iglesia ni Cristo Chapel was dedicated within the Ciudad de Victoria. Landscape PWP Landscape Architecture, the firm who landscaped the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, designed the landscape for the arena and the whole complex of Ciudad de Victoria. Headed by Chris Dimond, The Landscape Architect of the Ciudad De Victoria. The landscape design for phase one includes: The Philippine Arena, the Stadium Gardens, and the Water Gardens. The Philippine Arena landscape design is defined by a curvilinear system of formal trees and covered walkways that echo the elliptical form of the Arena connecting two arrival areas, two plazas and a grand stair that leads to the arena. The Stadium Gardens are defined by vertical layers of palm trees, drifts of informal flowering gardens, and dense hedges that expose two clearings for accommodating large casual gatherings or organized events. A series of outdoor plazas, gardens and performance venues form the setting for the development including: The North and South Arrival Plazas, The Promontory Plaza, The Great Stairs, and Ciudad de Victoria Plaza that are all related to each other with two cross axes (N-S and E-W) that intersect at the Promontory Plaza. These spaces are woven together both by a spine of formal trees and covered walkways that echo the elliptical form of the Arena. Records On December 31, 2015, the INC claimed three records during its \\"Countdown to 2016\\" event at the Ciudad de Victoria, these are Largest Fireworks Display, Longest Line of Sparklers Lit in A Relay, and Most Sparklers Lit Simultaneously.

Displayed at the Besser Museum of Northeast Michigan, in Alpena, Michigan, it is believed to be the last intact wooden fishing tug remaining. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. History The Katherine V. was built by Henry Vincent of Rogers City, Michigan in 1928 for Charles A. Vogelheim, and named for his wife and daughter. It was operated by the Vogelheim family, but they were not the ones who would fish her. They hired 2 captains who would direct where to put down the nets. In turn, they would each get a quarters pay. They would continue to fish her until around 1970. In 1973, the Vogelheims sold it to be converted into a yacht. The conversion was never done, and the Vogelheim family regained ownership in 1977. It remained at the fish docks in Rogers City until 2001, when the Vogelheims donated the fishing vessel to the Besser Museum. The museum moved the tug to its property with the intention of restoring it, and the tug was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. However, no restoration was started until 2013, when the museum started work on a new exhibit about Great Lakes fisheries heritage. Restoration was completed in 2019 and she is now available to the public to walk on its exterior. However, the inside is only open to the public at special events held by the museum. The vessel is one of about 900 boats that were in the Great Lakes gill net fishing fleet. She is unique in that she spent her entire fishing career in Lake Huron waters off the northeastern Lower peninsula. It has been noted that, \\"The Katherine V is the last remaining example of the large, wooden fish tugs that once plied the waters of Lake Huron on both the Canadian and American sides of the lake. She is also a splendid example of wooden ship building methods and skills that were once common among the craftsmen of this region.\\" The vessel is said to be emblematic of Great Lakes fisheries heritage, highlighting 'social, ecological and technical changes that occurred within the fishery and across the Great Lakes region during the early part of the 20th century.\\" in 2003, she was donated and brought to the Besser Museum. In 1931, the Katherine V. came to the assistance of another fishing tug, The Tramp, which became locked in ice that was thick. \\"The diligent crew worked tirelessly to free the vessel, but it still took seven days to break free. The Katherine V. and Tramp resumed their plans to catch fish, but the duo eventually had to return. Rather than risk becoming stuck again, the crews mutually agreed to wait until the ice would part. The two vessels waited for two weeks until they could return. The boats reached nearly ¬æ of a mile from shore, but the ice ahead of them was impenetrable. Both vessels left a watchman on duty at night in case the wind decided to change course.\\" Description The Katherine V is long and wide. It is equipped with a 75-90 hp. Kahlenberg oil engine. It is constructed of cypress and oak beams. The deck and hull have been ironed over. Her hull is constructed of white oak, northern white cedar and cypress. She was clad in steel and aluminum to aid in winter fishing.

It was written by Dan Christian Ghattas of the Internationalen Vereinigung Intergeschlechtlicher Menschen (the Organisation Intersex International (OII) in Germany) and published in October 2013 by the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation. The countries studied were Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, New Zealand, Serbia, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine and Uruguay. Synopsis The report is believed to be the first comparative international analysis of the human rights of intersex people. It found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide. Ghattas states: Ghattas found that: *Genital \\"normalization\\" surgeries are widespread: \\"Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order. Therefore, genital surgery is performed from infancy to adolescence and adulthood in all examined countries.\\" *Gonadal tissue is removed in most countries, between childhood and adolescence. Hormone treatments are administered. *There is minimal aftercare. *Birth registrations, with a sex assignment, is required in most countries, within 4 weeks of birth. *Intersex is treated as a taboo subject in all countries studied. Intersex people experience prejudice, often due to gender non-conforming behaviour and appearance. *Human rights-based activism is only recently established, and the number of NGOs small and volunteer-based. Ghattas makes five conclusions for human rights organisations: #Raise awareness of the existence of intersex individuals. #Increase visibility of intersex individuals and life situations. #Encourage intersex people to self-organise and voice needs. #Promote collaboration with NGOs. #Take account of the needs of intersex people in all areas of human rights work.

History The Department was established by the Fraser Government after a recommendation from the Defence Review Committee, which concluded that there were disadvantages in the previous large structure of the Defence Department. Charles Halton became Secretary of the new department. In July 1984 a 27-person senior executive team was appointed to assist the departmental Secretary, of which only one was a woman. The Department was abolished in December 1984, after Bob Hawke was elected Prime Minister in the 1983 Australian federal election. Hawke reasoned that the needs of Defence policy making in Australia would be better served if all responsibilities were bought together within the one portfolio. Scope Information about the department's functions and/or government funding allocation could be found in the Administrative Arrangements Orders, the annual Portfolio Budget Statements and in the Department's annual reports. Functions of the Department at its creation were: *Within defence policies approved by the Minister for Defence the following support for defence purposes - **Purchase of goods and services **Manufacture of goods and provision of services **Research and development **Development of Australian industry **Dockyard support.

Plot Law school professor Roger Bowdin prepares his seniors for their yearly \\"mock trial,\\" but star student Zachary Davis persists in wanting something more than the usual fake case. He gets the professor to agree to have the aspiring lawyers investigate the town itself, then put it on trial for anything they happen to find. Good-natured mayor Dick Williston goes along with the project when the professor approaches him about it, happy to cooperate with the class. The overzealous Zach begins to concern girlfriend Mary Judson, his roommate Bill Reeves, and others with the way he begins digging up potential controversies and scandals. His father having once been incarcerated for corruption in another town, Zach may have a personal vendetta in trying to implicate others. On the first day of the trial, with Mary assisting him as prosecuting attorney, Bill as jury foreman and the professor as presiding judge, Zach aggressively goes after the mayor with a number of unsubstantiated charges. When he brings up a potential tax malfeasance involving misappropriated funds, the popular mayor refuses to continue. Zach is promptly shunned in town, fired from his job and asked to leave by his landlady. A farmer, Al Rees, confronts him on the street, implying that Zach doesn't know what he's doing. The headstrong Zach refuses to relent, even when Mary points out that she wants to keep living in this town after they marry. Returning to the witness stand, the mayor explains how funds were used temporarily to keep farmers and other homeowners from losing their properties, with all funds later being replaced. Zach, ashamed by his aggressive behavior, intends to leave town, but the professor urges Mary to go after Zach and bring him back.

He played college baseball at the Virginia Military Institute for coaches Donny White and Paul Maini from 1985 to 1988. He then served as the head coach of the VMI Keydets (1992‚Äì1994) and the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers (2006‚Äì2011) Finwood has coached 61 players who were selected in the MLB Players Draft including 3 major leaguers. VMI Finwood was a standout shortstop at VMI, where he was named to the SoCon's All-North Division team three times. His .399 batting average remains sixth in school history. He also ranks highly on the program's all-time lists for hits and runs. He began coaching at VMI, serving as an assistant from 1989 through 1991 before being elevated to head coach. In his three years as a head coach, the Keydets went from 2 wins in 1991 to 21 wins in both 1993 and 1994, and played in the 1993 Southern Conference Baseball Tournament championship game. VCU and Auburn Finwood then moved to VCU, serving as assistant for four years and associate head coach for two. The Rams won more than 40 games in both 1998 and 1999, including a school record 46 in 1998. Both seasons, VCU earned trips to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship and won CAA regular season titles in 1997 and 1998. He then moved to Auburn where he worked as an assistant for five seasons. He was responsible for the Tiger defense and also served as recruiting coordinator. Auburn recorded the two highest fielding percentages in school history, and ranked highly in both the SEC and nationally. The Tigers reached four NCAA Tournaments. WKU After his time at Auburn, Finwood earned the head coaching position at WKU. From his first to his third season, the Hilltoppers improved by 11 conference wins, claimed a conference tournament title, and reached the first of two straight NCAA Regionals. In 2009, WKU won 42 games, a share of the regular season title, and earned an at- large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Finwood saw 17 Hilltoppers drafted, 55 sign professional contracts, and three players reached Major League Baseball. WKU ranked highly in defense, finishing third in the nation in 2009, and fifteenth in 2011. Old Dominion In June 2011, Finwood accepted the head coaching position at Old Dominion. The Monarchs improved from last to fourth in the CAA in the course of his first two seasons. However, due to the fact that ODU was moving to Conference USA the CAA officials ruled that they were ineligible for the conference tournament after winning 30 games and what would have been the third seed in the conference tournament. In 2014 Coach Finwood gave ODU its first ever C-USA victory in a 2‚Äì1 extra inning win on the road over then 15th ranked Rice Owls for his 300th career win. In just his third season at Old Dominion Coach Finwood lead the Monarchs to their first ever win over the number 1 ranked team in the country with an 8‚Äì1 victory over the Virginia Cavaliers at Harbor Park in Norfolk, reached the semifinals of the 2014 Conference USA Baseball Tournament, and earned an at-large bid in the Columbia, SC Regional of the 2014 NCAA Tournament, the school's eight appearance and first since 2000. The 2014 team finished the year third in the NCAA in double plays turned and first in Conference USA in double plays, doubles, HBPs, runs, stolen bases, and second in triples. In his four years at Old Dominion to date Finwood has had five players drafted (six picks) in the MLB Draft, two All-Americans, and several All-Conference selections as well as two victories over a #1 ranked team.

History Formed in November 1940 in Sydney, New South Wales, the regiment was assigned to the 8th Division and initially consisted of two batteries - the 29th and 30th. Each battery consisted of two troops, designated 'A' to 'D', and then later - when a third battery was raised - 'A' to 'E'. The regiment had an authorised strength of 42 officers and 385 other ranks in early 1941. Each battery eventually consisted of eight guns. After training with antiquated Ordnance QF 18-pounders, the regiment was re-equipped with 3-inch mortars due to a shortage of field pieces, and deployed to Malaya and Singapore along with the 27th Brigade in August 1941 to reinforce the 22nd Brigade, which had been deployed to Malaya earlier in the year following a request from the British government for Australian troops to help bolster the garrison amidst rising concerns about Japanese intentions in the Pacific. The regiment's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel John O'Neil, but on 11 November 1941 Lieutenant Colonel John Wright, who had previously served in the Australian Flying Corps during the First World War, took over after O'Neill was killed in a car accident. Lieutenant Colonel John O'Neill's funeral procession, November 1941. Shortly after arriving in Singapore, the regiment began training, taking up a position around Tampines in September. In November, it was re-equipped with Ordnance QF 25-pounders and raised its third battery - designated as the 65th Battery - by which time the regiment's strength grew to around 600 personnel. In early December 1941, the regiment moved north into Malaya and shortly afterwards the Japanese invaded. The regiment was assigned to the 22nd Brigade on the east coast and established its headquarters around Kluang. The initial onslaught of the Japanese thrust was directed against the British and Indian units in the northern part of peninsula, and so it was not until January that the Australians went into action. When they did, the regiment's batteries were split up: the 65th supported the 45th Indian Brigade, while the 29th and 30th were sent to help the Australian 27th Brigade. Throughout January they had a heavy workload, taking part in significant actions at Gemas, Muar and around Ayer Hitam and the Namazie Estate, firing thousands of rounds as they conducted rearguard actions over a distance of , as the Allied forces were pushed south towards Johore and then across the Causeway to Singapore island. During the campaign in Malaya, the regiment suffered numerous casualties as they were frequently called upon to provide support in close contact; the 30th Battery suffered particularly heavy casualties around Muar, with 24 men out of the battery's strength of 98 being wounded. A brief lull in the fighting followed, during which the regiment continued to fire support missions, attacking Japanese positions in Johore, as the Allied forces prepared for a Japanese attack on Singapore. On 8 February, the Japanese launched a strike across the Strait of Johore, concentrating several divisions on the 22nd Brigade's position in the north-west sector of the island. As the only artillery regiment positioned in support of the 22nd Brigade, the 2/15th was heavily engaged, attacking Japanese barges and assaulting troops, but as the defenders were stretched thinly, their lines were soon penetrated and they were forced to withdraw to prevent encirclement. During the withdrawal, a large number of guns were lost after the 30th Battery's transport became bogged. Over the course of a week, they were pushed back to Singapore city, and by 15 February, the garrison commander, Lieutenant General Arthur Percival gave the order for Allied forces to surrender. A total of 556 personnel from the 2/15th were captured; they would spend three-and-a-half years in Japanese captivity, during which 294 men died. After the war ended in August 1945, the surviving members of the regiment were repatriated to Australia and the regiment was disbanded.

It was a branch of the North Branch Canal, which was one of only two major canals in Pennsylvania to be owned by the state. The creek went from West Nanticoke to Pittston, going through Luzerne County. Course The Wyoming Division Canal started near Solomon Creek. It paralleled the eastern bank of the Susquehanna River in Wilkes-Barre, crossing over Mill Creek via an aqueduct and passed by the Hollenback Cemetery and the current site of the Luzerne County Courthouse. The canal then ran to Back Street, which is now known as Pennsylvania Avenue, and paralleled it for some distance before paralleling Wilkes-Barre Boulevard, and passing by the Stegmaier Building. It then ran back in the direction of the river between Union Street and Bennett Street. The canal at this point passed through a geographical formation called the Redoubt, which was at least high. The canal ended at Pittston. History and significance In 1831, George Wolf, the governor of Pennsylvania, borrowed $2,400,000 to create and expand a number of canals in Pennsylvania, including the Wyoming Division Canal. The purpose of this canal was to connect the city of Philadelphia the state of New York with the coal-mining lands in Luzerne County, and to connect the Pennsylvania Canal with the Erie Canal. The project was approved by the state legislature with a $100,000 budget, but was delayed for several years. Reasons for the delay included arguments over the course of the canal, inclement weather, and disagreements between the contractors and the engineers. Construction began in 1831, and by February 1832, of canal had been built and the budget had been exceeded. By 1833, the estimated budget had reached $220,594.56. The estimated completion date was changed to August 1833, but construction did not finish until June 23, 1834. The total cost of the canal was $342,625. There were numerous geographical difficulties with the construction of the Wyoming Division Canal. These included large cliffs near Wilkes-Barre. The Wyoming Division Canal was sold by the state to a private company, the North Branch Canal Company in April 1858. In 1865, the canal was damaged in a flood, but was rebuilt. The Wyoming Canal closed in 1882. It was succeeded in functionality by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission placed a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker commemorating the Wyoming Division Canal in Wilkes-Barre in August 1994. The Wyoming Division Canal contributed to the Wyoming Valley becoming the largest producer of anthracite in the world. Description and features The Wyoming Division Canal had a total length of . It ran between West Nanticoke and Pittston. It also had a public boat basin. A wall was also constructed on the canal. The depth of the water in the canal was . Boats accessing the Wyoming Division Canal via the North Branch Canal did so by taking a rope ferry across the Susquehanna River to the Wyoming Division Canal. The Wyoming Division Canal had five locks. The first lock was called the Outlet Lock and was in height. The second one was unnamed and was in height. The third one was in Wilkes- Barre and was also in height. The fourth one was in Plainsville and was in height. The fifth lock was at Port Blanchard and was in height. Uses The main locations that the Wyoming Division Canal was used to transport goods to included Harrisburg, Philadelphia, and the Great Lakes. However, some coal barons were unwilling to rely entirely on the canal to transport their coal.

The primary interest of the group is its 78% majority ownership of City Football Group, a worldwide organisation most notably controlling Manchester City F.C, Mumbai City FC, Melbourne City F.C and New York City F.C., as well as several other international football clubs. However, it also holds interests in various other endeavours outside of the sporting world with an extensive property portfolio in the United Arab Emirates and Manchester. It was initially thought that Abu Dhabi United Group was a part of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund owned by Abu Dhabi. But Abu Dhabi United Group had denied connection to the government of Abu Dhabi.  City Football Group  The Group was founded in the summer of 2008, as Sheikh Mansour looked to take over Manchester City Football Club from the former Prime Minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra and signed off the deal on 1 September 2008, with due diligence completed on 23 September the same year. The US-educated Sulaiman Al-Fahim was the public face of ADUG during the initial phase of the takeover - a larger-than-life figure often described as the \\"Donald Trump of Abu Dhabi\\". On completion of the takeover, Al-Fahim generated considerable attention in the footballing world with promises of grandiose spending plans to capture the world's greatest footballing talents. Although he did bring in the Brazilian Robinho from Real Madrid on the same day on which the takeover was agreed, One week after ADUG took control of the club Al-Fahim was removed from his role to be replaced by the much more restrained Khaldoon al-Mubarak, who remains in position to the present day. In 2011, Manchester City qualified for the Champions League and won the FA Cup, providing the club their first success in over three decades following ADUG's support. In 2012, the club won the Premier League, their first league title in forty-four years. Following the success of the Manchester club, ADUG began investment into other football clubs. After founding the MLS side New York City FC and purchasing the A-League franchise Melbourne Heart FC (shortly afterwards renamed Melbourne City FC), it was deemed necessary to create a new infrastructure to manage the various worldwide footballing ventures, and to keep them separate from non-footballing business. For this purpose, City Football Group was created in 2014 to oversee all of the teams under their control, acting as holding company not only to the football teams but to several businesses designed to market football services to the wider market. In return, ADUG became the holding company for CFG. ADUG have diluted their shareholding the City Football Group on two occasions in 2015 and 2019 to the approximate value of ¬£654 million. As of 2020, they own 78% of the City Football Group.  Other business interests  ADUG also have an extensive property portfolio in the United Arab Emirates and abroad. Aside from Manchester City F.C., ADUG have amassed investments totalling nearly ¬£1 billion in Manchester, mainly in property and higher education sectors. Aside from purchasing assets for their own control, ADUG signed a ten-year partnership with Manchester City Council to revamp the east end of the city - not coincidentally the same area in which Manchester City are based - creating the Manchester Life Development Company in conjunction with the council in order to build 6,000 affordable houses in the area. Masdar and Mubadala Developments, sister investment vehicles of Abu Dhabi managed by Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak also holds numerous investments which are linked to ADUG.

In , Rocksberg had a population of 300. Geography The Caboolture River flows from north to east through the locality with Zillmans Crossing being a former ford (now a low-level bridge) across the river. The ford was part of the Old North Road (now superseded by the Bruce Highway) and was named after Leopold Zillman, an early pioneer farmer in the area. The river flats (elevation about 50 metres above sea level) are used for agriculture, mostly grazing, but the western side of the locality is undeveloped mountain land rising to numerous unnamed peaks, the highest being 350 metres above sea level. There is a picnic reserve near Zillmans Crossing. History The locality takes its name from the property name used by the Zillman family. In the early 1840s, the Archer brothers of Durundur Station and Evan Mackenzie of Kilcoy Station blazed a trail to connect their farms with Brisbane, creating Old North Road (as it now known) as the first road north from Brisbane. Later it was supplanted by a road closer to the coast (now known as Old Gympie Road) and subsequently by the Bruce Highway even closer to the coast. Rocksberg Provisional School opened on 19 June 1893, becoming Rocksberg State School on 1 January 1909. It closed in 1954. Demographics In the , Rocksberg recorded a population of 302 people, 49% female and 51% male. The median age of the Rocksberg population was 43 years, 6 years above the Australian median. 76.6% of people living in Rocksberg were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 4.7%, New Zealand 2.7%, South Africa 2.3%, Indonesia 1%, Netherlands 1%. 88% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 1% Dutch, 1% German, 1% Indonesian, 0% Irish, 0% Gaelic (Scotland).
