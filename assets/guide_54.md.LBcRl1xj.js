Process Particles finer than 0.1 ¬µm (10‚àí7m) in water remain continuously in motion due to electrostatic charge (often negative) which causes them to repel each other. Once their electrostatic charge is neutralized by the use of a coagulant chemical, the finer particles start to collide and agglomerate (collect together) under the influence of Van der Waals forces. These larger and heavier particles are called flocs. Flocculants, or flocculating agents (also known as flocking agents), are chemicals that promote flocculation by causing colloids and other suspended particles in liquids to aggregate, forming a floc. Flocculants are used in water treatment processes to improve the sedimentation or filterability of small particles. For example, a flocculant may be used in swimming pool or drinking water filtration to aid removal of microscopic particles which would otherwise cause the water to be turbid (cloudy) and which would be difficult or impossible to remove by filtration alone. Many flocculants are multivalent cations such as aluminium, iron, calcium or magnesium. These positively charged molecules interact with negatively charged particles and molecules to reduce the barriers to aggregation. In addition, many of these chemicals, under appropriate pH and other conditions such as temperature and salinity, react with water to form insoluble hydroxides which, upon precipitating, link together to form long chains or meshes, physically trapping small particles into the larger floc. Long-chain polymer flocculants, such as modified polyacrylamides, are manufactured and sold by the flocculant producing business. These can be supplied in dry or liquid form for use in the flocculation process. The most common liquid polyacrylamide is supplied as an emulsion with 10-40% actives and the rest is a non-aqueous carrier fluid, surfactants and latex. This form allows easy handling of viscous polymers at high concentrations. These emulsion polymers require \\"activation\\" - inversion of the emulsion so that the polymers molecules form an aqueous solution.

She first appears in \\"The Kids Stay in the Picture,\\" initially appearing as Serena's estranged cousin, Charlie Rhodes, whom Serena takes under her wing and introduces to the Upper East Side. The fourth season finale \\"The Wrong Goodbye,\\" reveals her true identity as Ivy Dickens, a struggling actress and con artist hired by Carol Rhodes to pose as her daughter in order to gain access to the real Charlie Rhodes' trust fund. DeFer was promoted to series regular for the fifth season in light of cast members Taylor Momsen and Jessica Szohr's departure. She is the newest addition to the female cast of Gossip Girl villains, joining the likes of Georgina Sparks and Juliet Sharp. Television series =Casting and characterization= Introduced in the fourth season, DeFer was set to join the cast as Carol's daughter and Serena and Eric's cousin, Charlie Rhodes. DeFer's contract with the show also included the possibility of her becoming a series regular for the fifth season. She first auditioned for the role of Raina Thorpe. However, that role went to Tika Sumpter. DeFer was called back for the role of Charlie Rhodes, with the show's writers stating that they were writing something new for her character. DeFer had also previously worked with Gossip Girl executive producers, Stephanie Savage and Joe Lazarov as well as Penn Badgley in The Mountain. Executive producer Joshua Safran later commented on her introduction and the perception that the character brought to the show. \\"We always like it when we have new people who are witnessing this world for the first time...For Charlie, it‚Äôs like trial by fire. From reading Gossip Girl for the first time or going to your first event, all that stuff we get to do over again in a new way.\\" Charlie's integration also made her a voice for the audience and critics of Gossip Girl. TV Fanatic warmly welcomed her character, stating that she \\"good-naturedly mocked the show and its often convoluted plot lines.\\" DeFer would later reveal details behind her character's involvement in the fourth season finale, \\"As far as I know I‚Äôm just in the next five episodes until the season finale, and then I have no idea. But I really hope we get the opportunity to finish what Charlie started as I think it‚Äôs going to be a story-line that people will really want to follow.\\" DeFer also states that Charlie is more relatable in comparison to other characters that have appeared in the show. \\"She is such a real person, not being from that life and what not...\\" =Season 4= The character is first introduced in the second half of season four as Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Rhodes, the estranged cousin of Serena and Eric van der Woodsen. Under the guise of Charlie Rhodes, she experiences the world of the Upper East Side, becoming particularly close with Dan Humphrey, though Dan puts a stop to the budding relationship because of his history with Serena. However, upon learning that Vanessa Abrams had intentionally sabotaged a meeting Charlie had organized, Dan allows himself to become closer to Charlie while severing his ties with Vanessa. The two then begin an awkward relationship which concludes in the season's penultimate episode when Charlie, dressed like Serena, demands that Dan call her by Serena's name. It is later revealed that Charlie suffers from bi-polar disorder and she has stopped taking her medication. She leaves the Upper East Side and meets up with her mother, Carol. In the season's final moments, \\"Charlie Rhodes\\" is revealed to be Ivy Dickens, an aspiring actress that Carol hired to gain access to her daughter's trust fund. In her final scene she puts a napkin with Georgina's number in her bag which hints that the two will team up in the fifth season. With regard to her involvement in the finale, DeFer discussed her character's involvement. \\"Charlie has a great deal to do with the season finale...but what I am allowed to say is that Charlie does mix it up with every character.\\" =Season 5= In between the fourth and fifth seasons, after returning to Miami, Ivy moved to Los Angeles with her boyfriend, Max, in order to become an actress. Ivy later runs into Serena at a restaurant that she and her boyfriend both work at and Serena, under the impression that Ivy is Charlie, offers to have Ivy move in with her. Ivy declines, looking for several ways to get out of the situation, but Serena convinces her to move back to New York with her. After she and Serena return to New York, Charlie overhears that Carol is returning to New York and that Lily refuses to deceive her and she tells Serena that she is leaving. Serena, however, has seen this coming and asks her to return her tickets to a fashion show. When Charlie arrives, she discovers that Serena actually had her take her place as a model. After a conversation with Blair, she decides to stay. Her excitement does not last as she runs into Carol with Lily and Rufus, who had no idea that she had returned. After a confrontation with Carol, Ivy states that the family that Carol hates has been kinder to her than her own and that everything in New York 'sparkles' and she refuses to give that up and that the van der Woodsens would have a problem should it ever come out that Carol had hired her to impersonate Charlie in order to gain access to her trust fund. After this conversation, Carol tells Ivy that she is on her own and that Carol will not help Ivy any more should her real identity ever be discovered before returning to Miami. Ivy later panics when she learns that she has left her cell phone at the fashion show, as she believes her true identity will be discovered. She is unaware, however, that her phone, along with several others, had been stolen by Nate Archibald and his shrewd boss Diana. After a conversation with Nate about the phone, she offers to help him find the owner in attempt to retrieve it. After she has accomplished this, however, Diana has discovered the connection between Ivy and Charlie and agrees to keep silent as long as Ivy works for her. Under Diana's control, Ivy is forced to procure gossip for Diana's use. She later finds the files that Bart Bass kept on Serena, Lily, Eric and himself, while Nate convinces her to leave them, she does not and in turn hands them over to Diana. Ivy later competes to become a bridesmaid for Blair in order to get the scoop on her wedding for Diana, where her final task is to secure a kiss from Nate. They later attend the launch party of Diana's revamped 'Spectator' where they use each other to reach their own ends; Ivy to win Blair's bridesmaid spot and Nate to make Diana jealous, unknown to the other. Diana later confronts Ivy and threatens to reveal her secret, while Ivy is adamant that she had no idea that she was the one Nate wanted to make jealous. Diana later reveals to Nate and Ivy that they had been deceiving each other, leaving them angry at one another. Although Ivy has developed feelings for Nate, Diana has threatened her to stay away from him. This changes, however, when she finds out that Ivy's ex-boyfriend, Max, is in town looking for her and sets up an elaborate plot that very nearly causes her secret to be revealed. Max finds Gossip Girl's website, along with a picture of Ivy under 'Charlie Rhodes'. He tracks Ivy down at the Van der Woodsen loft and Ivy is backed into a corner where she tells Lily and Max that her mother made her change her name to Ivy in order to avoid being used for her money. While discussing this later, Ivy offers Max money to leave town and start his restaurant in Portland, Oregon. When he finds out that Ivy is actually impersonating Charlie Rhodes, he blackmails Ivy into giving him more money than she had originally offered before deciding to stay in town. When Carol and CeCe return to town however, Carol tries to help Ivy out of her trouble with Max by getting CeCe to unlock the rest of Charlie's trust fund, which she does. After Ivy convinces Serena to drop her date with Max on Carol's advice, Max shows up to the party and attempts to out Charlie as Ivy to the rest of the Rhodes/Van der Woodsen family. It is Carol, however, that convinces the family that Max is lying, later telling Ivy that if the family found out what has happened to the real Charlie Rhodes, Ivy wouldn't be the only one out. Carol tells Ivy that she may now leave New York and start a new life with the wealth she now possesses. Ivy, however, tells her that she doesn't care about the wealth and luxury of being a part of the family, and that Carol can have the trust fund, since all she really wants is a family to call her own. Max continues to threaten Ivy, taking her story to Nate, who has already been warned by the Van der Woodsens. When this fails, Max takes his story to Nate's cousin Trip who is a congressman, on the eve of Charlie's debut into the Upper East Side society. When Max shows up at her party, Ivy sends a blast to Gossip Girl about Blair and Chuck being there as well, sending the paparazzi into the party as well. When Blair and Chuck get into a life-threatening car accident after being tailed by the paparazzi, Ivy confesses to Rufus that she is a fraud, but before he can respond, Lily arrives with news that Blair is awake and responding, but Chuck is not. Overwhelmed with guilt, Ivy calls Carol and asks her to help her leave the Upper East Side for good. A few weeks later, concerned by Charlie's long absence, Lily hires a private investigator to find her, but the private investigator instead finds the real Charlie Rhodes, who is attending school at Juilliard. When Lily and the \\"real Charlie\\" meet, they do not recognize each other and nor do they seem to be aware of each other's existence. Ivy returns briefly, looking for Lily. She finds Rufus instead, but is told where Lily can be found. Georgina discovers that Ivy is back and blackmails her into attending Nate's party. While at Nate's party, Ivy runs into the real Charlie Rhodes, who goes by the alias 'Lola' and it is revealed that they took the same acting class where they grew up in Florida. Ivy attempts to leave again, but is spotted by Nate, still not knowing the truth about either of them. Nate makes a comment to Charlie about Ivy leading Charlie to get suspicious. When Ivy can finally leave, it is revealed that she has been visiting CeCe the whole time she was away. CeCe's condition worsens and Ivy is forced to take her to the hospital, where she has a run in with the Van der Woodsens and Carol. When Charlie arrives, Ivy and Carol finally tell the truth about Carol's scheme and Ivy's role in it. Ivy is turned away by the Van der Woodsens. Following this, Ivy turns to Georgina and the two later crash CeCe's wake, during which, through the reading of CeCe's will, Ivy is left everything under her legal name instead of her alias Charlie Rhodes, revealing that CeCe knew about the fact that Ivy isn't her real granddaughter. After this revelation, Ivy kicks Lily and Rufus out of the apartment as it had been paid for by CeCe and was now hers. Ivy throws a party to commemorate the Celia Rhodes Foundation and to gain acceptance in the Upper East Side. She believes she has found an ally in William van der Woodsen after he agrees to persuade people to attend the party in exchange for money, however, it is later revealed he is working with Lily to gather evidence against Ivy to take her to court and contest CeCe's will. After a courtroom hearing, Ivy loses all of her inheritance after Lily bribes CeCe's nurse to testify against Ivy so she can re-claim Ivy's share of the inheritance. Rufus takes pity on Ivy being without a home and family, and pays for her stay at a hotel. Lily finds this out later on and they fight, and Rufus returns to Brooklyn. Ivy later visits Lily and tries to seek her acceptance, confessing that she really wanted to be part of her family. Lily rejects her but offers her a cheque of 1 million dollars, asking her to leave and never return. Ivy leaves the apartment and tears up the cheque, revealing her confession was genuine. Later, Lily has Carol Rhodes arrested and charged with fraud in order to acquire her share of CeCe's estate for herself. After William van der Woodsen takes pity on Charlie 'Lola' Rhodes, he gives her Carol's share of CeCe's wealth so she can live on. In the final episode of the season, Lola signs over her entire half of Cece's estate to Ivy and asks her to do one favor in return: Take Lily down in revenge for Carol's imprisonment and her manipulation of events. Ivy accepts, more than happy to help after her rejection. =Season 6= Ivy looks in on Rufus after Lily annuls their marriage and the two soon become lovers. However, Ivy is actually sleeping with Lily's ex-husband William and using Bart in a plot to take down Lily. When Rufus sees the two kissing (although not seeing William's face), he breaks up with Ivy. Ivy helps Blair in her plans to try and take down Chuck's father and when the man dies, she believes it's finally time she and William come out in public as a couple. However, when she meets William, he is with Lily and claims to have never met Ivy before. Ivy tries to tell Lily of their relationship but Lily doesn't believe her. After Lily leaves, William informs Ivy he was using her all along to break up Lily and Rufus so he could finally have Lily to himself. He coldly informs Ivy nobody wants her around and she should just take her money and leave. In the final scene (set five years later) Ivy has written a book about her experiences that's being made into a movie, starring Olivia Burke and Lola Rhodes. Reception The critical reception of the character had been positive until the start of Season 5. During the series fourth season, Charlie became the subject of praise with her successful integration into the Upper East Side. TV Fanatic praised and welcomed her presence on the show. In the episode The Princesses and the Frog, Steve Marsi praised her choice of confronting Vanessa alone, calling her \\"a natural\\" at schemes and that \\"even an outsider can thoroughly outshine an outcast.\\" TV Guide praised the ousting of Vanessa by Charlie, stating that \\"it didn't take her long to cross over to \\"the other side\\"\\". Beginning in the fifth season, however, her character began to receive less than favorable reviews. NY Mag and The Baltimore Sun referred to the Charlie/Ivy plot as \\"ridiculous\\". The Wall Street Journal suggested that the storyline was repetitive, baring too much of a resemblance to the Juliet and Vanessa plot in the previous season. Sharon Tharp of Ology wrote that the Charlie/Ivy plot was predictable and earned \\"too much screentime\\".

He trained at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1903‚Äì1906 and initially supported himself as a wheelsman aboard Great Lakes ships from 1906‚Äì1914, later serving in the Illinois Naval Reserve during World War I. He also worked as a commercial illustrator. He was a master watercolorist of marine, sporting, and military World War II scenes. He developed a love of the sea and is probably best known as a painter of marine subjects. Sessions painted images of numerous locations, from the Bahamas to New England's busy fishing harbors, north to the raw fishing grounds of Nova Scotia, and ultimately to the Navajo reservations in New Mexico. Not only do his works document important World War II historical events, they visually portray and convey the spirit of the American fighting forces in both the Pacific and European campaigns, commencing with the bombing of Pearl Harbor, followed by D-Day Europe through to the final phases of the Pacific war, such as Jimmy Doolittle's daylight bombing raids of the Japanese mainland to the unconditional surrender of the Japanese military. The Chicago Tribune newspaper utilized his talents and Sessions is considered to be the greatest \\"brush reporter\\" of World War II. His works can be found in Presidential collections, numerous important corporate collections and military establishments throughout the country. Sessions created numerous wartime advertisements. Examples are a 1943 Willys Jeep ad showing the Coast Guard at Guadalcanal, and a Borg-Warner ad in 1945 showing the mass production of radiators and clutches for motorized warfare manufactured in Detroit. His work is highly collectible in the field of Militaria/WWII/1939-1945. In 1962 the New York Graphic Society commissioned him to make four paintings, reproductions of which were distributed as part of the Society's Works of Masters Group. Many of his other paintings have been reproduced over the years, issued as posters and as high quality reprints on watercolor paper. Sessions was married in Chicago, Illinois in 1946 to Chrysanthy G. Deamanthopulos. Although very prolific in the style of John Whorf and Ogden Pleissner, he unfortunately destroyed much of his own work. He died on November 14, 1962 in Chicago at the age of 80.

Histori de la virgen de Itat√≠, Mburucuyapora.com History Basilica of Our Lady of Itat√≠. The first Franciscan community settled in the Santa Ana area, also known as the Reduction of Yaguari, in 1528. The reflection of the Lady of Itat√≠ appeared three times under a rock along a river of the Paran√° Basin, which led the Franciscan settlers to build a statue dedicated to the Lady of Itat√≠ in 1589. Itat√≠, Nuestra Se√±ora de, Catholic.net Shortly afterwards, local Indians fought against the Franciscans and captured the statue. Then they questioned the precise location of the apparition of the Itat√≠ Virgin, and claimed to have found another rock from which a bright light and a surnatural sound emanated. Franciscans and Indians agreed on a place for the Virgen, and created the new city Pueblo de Indios de la Pura y Limpia concepci√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora de Itat√≠. The shrine played a central role in reducing the water currents of the region to enable settlements to be built. According to legend, the wooden representation of the Virgin Mary saved the life of 17th-century Jesuit missionary, Luis de Bola√±os, known for his attempts to convert the natives to Catholicism. It is also said that the Virgin intervened in a battle between two native tribes, resulting in the victory of the tribe with the conquerors' aid. On July 16, 1900, the statue of Our Lady was granted a Canonical Coronation under the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII, who proclaimed the statue as the patron saint of Corrientes, and creating the diocese of Corrrientes.

The fight for the four seats on the Board became highly ideological, pitting the right- leaning Controllers Nora-Frances Henderson, Hugh McDermid McIntyre, and William Alfred Weir, as well as Ward One Alderman Herbert Hannah and Ward Five Alderman Douglas Belling Gordon, against a broad spectrum of candidates on the left, notably the Labor-Progressive Party nominee Helen Anderson, who was a Ward Seven Alderman, and the C.C.F. candidate, Roy Aindow. Andrew Frame, a veteran and former Controller, and Walter Thomas Carroll comprised the remainder of the nine-candidate field. Henderson remained a favourite throughout the race. A 12-term Controller at the time of the election, the politically conservative Henderson became the de facto leader of the anti- Lawrence faction on Council. Henderson was heartily endorsed by the Hamilton Spectator, who called her, \\"One of the best public servants this city has ever had. A woman of integrity, intelligence and great courage,\\" and was the focus of a full-page photo spread, chronicling her average day on the campaign trail.\\"Events Of A Day In The Busy Life Of A Candidate For Civic Office\\", Hamilton Spectator, Lifestyle, Thursday, December 5, 1946, pp 14. Her campaign centred primarily on her political independence, as well as her opposition to a proposal to widen King William Street, and her support for open-shop unionization of the city's employees, noting that she could not, \\"be a party to the union shop which would compel us to refuse work to a man or woman who did not want to join a union.\\"\\"Nora Frances Henderson\\", Hamilton Spectator, News, Friday, November 22, 1946, pp 14. Considerable attention was paid to Helen Anderson, the sitting Ward Seven Alderman and organizer for the Labor- Progressive Party. In a profile done by the Hamilton Spectator, she was described as a \\"shrewd, aggressive, extreme Leftist.\\" Central to her campaign was more housing for the city's working-class residents, a better redistribution of wealth, and a move away from a business-centred approach to municipal governance.\\"Mrs. Helen Anderson\\", Hamilton Spectator, News, Friday, November 22, 1946, pp. 14. The Spectator dedicated an editorial to her candidacy, writing that \\"those who sleep on the assurance that this minority is a bit of a joke may find out too late that it is anything but a joke.\\"\\"It Starts Right Here\\", Hamilton Spectator, Editorial, Friday, November 29, 1946, pp. 6. Andrew Frame was an incumbent Controller, veteran of World Wars I and II and the former secretary of the Hamilton Boy Scouts. His platform took issue with a proposal to widen King William Street, which he opposed on financial grounds, improving housing for veterans, and developing a bathing beach for the city's youth\\"Andrew H. Frame\\" Hamilton Spectator, News, Friday, November 22, 1946, pp. 14. Hugh McDermid McIntyre was a Scottish-Canadian printer and sitting member of the Board of Control. Roy Aindow was a World War I veteran, union organizer and candidate supported by the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. The Hamilton Spectator described Aindow as \\"Intelligent, likable, [and] a conscientious partisan.\\" Aindow ran on his record of serving in the military, and vowed to improve labour relations in the city and building more public housing.\\"Roy Aindow\\", Hamilton Spectator, News, Friday, November 22, 1946, pp 14. Two of the prominent candidates in the race were William Alfred Weir and Herbert Reginald Hannah. Weir was a sitting member of the Board of Control, and, as the Spectator noted, \\"not inclined to controversy,\\" while Hannah was one of Ward 1's Aldermen, described by the Hamilton Spectator as \\"aggressive, keen, competent.\\" Douglas Belling Gordon was, at the time, an Alderman for Ward Five, and was viewed as a critic of the administration. Gordon campaigned on providing housing for returning veterans and installing parking meters to provide revenue for civic improvement projects.\\"Douglas B. Gordon\\" Hamilton Spectator, News, Friday, November 22, 1946, pp. 14. Rounding out the field was Walter Thomas Carroll, who was listed as having no fixed employment and a \\"well-known figure in Ward 5.\\" Carroll ran on a platform of better sewage management for the city after a personal campaign to clean up Hamilton Harbour attracted the interest of the Drew government.\\"Walter T.

On the death of Henry Bilson-Legge, Member of Parliament for Hampshire in 1764, Wallop's elder brother, John Wallop, 2nd Earl of Portsmouth, agreed not to use his interest in the by-election in exchange for the post of groom of the bedchamber to the Duke of Cumberland for Henry. George Grenville recommended him to King George, but the King declined to interfere with his brother's appointments to that office. However, on 24 August 1765, Wallop was appointed a Royal Groom of the Bedchamber in place of Henry Seymour, an office he held until 1771. On 29 March 1768, he was promoted to a captaincy in the 41st Regiment of Foot. In the 1768 election, he was returned for Whitchurch by his brother, who had inherited an electoral interest there from their mother.

The Antelope Creek People lived mostly on terraces overlooking the river or in side canyons with springs. Panhandle culture is a prehistoric culture of the southern High Plains during the Middle Ceramic Period from AD 1200 to 1400. Panhandle sites are primarily in the panhandle and west central Oklahoma and the northern half of the Texas Panhandle. The culture was likely an outgrowth of the Woodland phase or a migration of people from north-central Kansas.Gibbon, Guy E.; Ames, Kenneth M. Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia. 1998. p. 20. . Panhandle focus divisions Antelope Creek focus is the primary, and to some the only, cultural tradition of the Panhandle culture. The Optima focus was defined for sites in west central Oklahoma, but after further study, these sites were defined as Antelope Creek focus. In 1975 Robert G. Campbell defined the Apishapa culture of southeastern Colorado's Chaquaqua Plateau as a Panhandle culture, which is disputed by other noted archaeologists.Gunnerson, James H. (1987). Archaeology of the High Plains. Denver: United States Forest Service. p. 87. Difficulty defining Panhandle culture Several contributing factors have made it difficult to define the Panhandle culture, such as discrepancies in reporting carbon dating of artifacts, variations in interpretation of dating information, spotty information, and a lack of published material about the Panhandle culture. Distinctive traits While it has been difficult to define the time periods and foci of the Panhandle culture, there are some distinguishing characteristics: * Great similarity to the Central Plains complexes * Some, but much less, evidence of trading or influence of Southwestern pueblo cultures. Their material goods also indicated other trading influences, such as plains pottery, sea-shells, and Smoky Hill Jasper from northwestern Kansas. * Single or multi-roomed stone structures, often with altars at the back of the structures and posts at four corners of the structure for support. People also camped or used sites with limited purposes. * People were hunter-gatherers of large and small mammals and wild plants, nuts and fruit. Some farmed. A primary good for trade for the Panhandle culture was Alibates agatized dolomite, such as that found at the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument. Location of Panhandle sites Most of the sites are centered on the Canadian River and North Canadian River or its tributaries, primarily Antelope Creek and also Cottonwood Creek, Dixon Creek, and Tarbox Creek. Panhandle culture sites were also found on the Archie King Ranch.

The first Mata‚Äôuvave was appointed to a gubernatorial role by Tu‚Äôi Tonga Kau‚Äôulufonua I to increase the Tu‚Äôi Tonga‚Äôs control over Ha‚Äôapai. The first few generations of the title subdued several islands in northern Ha‚Äôapai and undertook several major building projects, most notably pigeon mounds, the Huluipaongo burial mound, and the Velata fortress. Within a few generations the Mata‚Äôuvave attempted to rule independently, antagonizing the authority of chiefs in Tongatapu and causing a confrontation that the Mata‚Äôuvave eventually lost. They were relegated to a line of nobility called ‚Äòeiki si‚Äôi, or ‚Äúa minor chief without importance.‚Äù Creation of the Title The Mata‚Äôuvave dynasty was created out of the drastic political restructuring of the Tongan elite following the assassination of the 23rd Tu‚Äôi Tonga, Takalaua, in the late 14th or early 15th century. Takalaua was succeeded by his son Kau‚Äôulufonua as the 24th Tu‚Äôi Tonga. Kau‚Äôulufonua chased the assassins, according to tradition, to  ªEua, Ha‚Äôapai, Vava‚Äôu, Niuatoputapu, Futuna, Uvea, and eventually killed them in brutal fashion in Samoa, thereby earning the name Kau‚Äôulufonuafekai, or Kau‚Äôulufonua the savage.David V. Burley, Mata'uvave and 15th Century Ha'apai, The Journal of Pacific History, Vol. 30 No. 2 (Dec., 1995). pp. 154-172 At the same time, the secular duties of the Tu‚ÄôI Tonga were divested into a new title called Tu‚Äôi Ha‚Äôatakalaua while the Tu‚ÄôI Tonga became more of a religious and ceremonial figure. Historians are unsure of the veracity of the revenge story, but it describes a known reassertion of control of the Tongatapu chiefs over the island groups within the Tu‚Äôi Tonga empire at that time. Either Kau‚Äôulufonuafekai or the new Tu‚Äôi Ha‚Äôatakalaua appointed powerful new governors for each of the main island groups. Mata‚Äôuvave received the dominion of Ha‚Äôapai. Domination of Northern Ha‚Äôapai The colorful early history of the Mata‚Äôuvave dynasty is based only on oral tradition and interpretation of place names, but archaeologist David V. Burley has found corroborating evidence in remnants of ceremonial mounds and fortresses. Oral tradition describes these events as though it all happened to one man, but historians suggest that the following events occurred over a longer period of time and by several title holders. The Mata‚Äôuvave and his supporters initially settled in Hihifo on Lifuka island, where they forced Ha‚Äôapaians to build the large fortress of Velata. He worshipped the god Aloaaloa and his tract of land was known as Tamatuiume‚Äôe. From his base in Hihifo, the Mata‚Äôuvave conquered Foa island by destroying the fortress in Lotofoa. In league with ‚Äúthe cannibal chief Tahi Fisi,‚Äù he then defeated the powerful Ha‚Äôa Ngana chiefs who had power bases in ‚ÄòUiha and Kauvai Islands. The Mata‚Äôuvave moved with his supporters to ‚ÄòUiha island and ruled over the more populated Lifuka and Foa Islands to the north. As a Mata‚Äôuvave title holder in the 1920s told, ‚ÄúMata‚Äôuvave went to live in U‚Äôoleva island. If he wanted to let the people know that he was going to give a command (fono) he would send someone to the north shore of Uoleva to remove his garment and expose his buttocks. Then the people in Lifuka would know that the governor was going to give a command as to certain work to be done. If the signal were given in the afternoon, the people assembled that evening in Uoleva. When a chief‚Äôs grave was to be dug or a pigeon mound to be erected sufficient labor was obtained for the earth to be dug and the mound formed in the night. In the morning the mound (sea) would be already made.‚Äù The Mata‚Äôuvave ordered the people of Lifuka to build many monuments either for himself of for other chiefs to project status and power. Most of these structures were mounds for pigeon snaring, which was a sport reserved only for chiefs but required substantial investments of plebeian labor. There are pigeon snaring mounds associated with Mata‚Äôuvave on Lofanga, Ha‚Äôano, Nukunamo, Tatafa, and Uoleva islands. Uoleva has ten pigeons mounds, including one named Siaulufotu, the largest such mound in all of Tonga. He also had constructed adjacent to Siaulufotu a freshwater bathing well named Vaisio‚Äôata. Between Uoleva and Lifuka islands is a shallow reef that was then and is still now walkable during low time. Oral tradition tells that after a daughter of the Mata‚Äôuvave, Tahilakifue, ‚Äúhurt herself by falling on a rock trying to cross the exposed reef from Uoleva to Lifuka, Mata‚Äôuvave had the people clear a path between the two islands. Given the haughty nature of Tahilakifue, the area where she fell was named Foki‚Äôangatoma (toma meaning to dress pretentiously). The path is known as Ta‚Äôemaka, meaning to hew the stone.‚Äù The first Mata‚Äôuvave is believed to have been buried in Nuanga, near present-day Pangai on Lifuka Island, but successive title holders were buried at Huluipaongo, also known as the Burial Mound of Mata‚Äôuvave. It is located at the southern tip of Lifuka island and is the highest mound on all of Lifuka. Tradition tells that it was constructed either from the clay used to wash hair as people walked from ‚ÄòUoleva to Lifuka (after building the pigeon mounds) or that it was carried from nearby in baskets. Confrontation with Tongatapu The title of Mata‚Äôuvave was created to instill a governor in Ha‚Äôapai who was subservient to the Tu‚Äôi Tonga and Tu‚Äôi Ha‚Äôatakalaua in Tongatapu. Over time, however, the Mata‚Äôuvave attempted to gain more autonomy. The only specific story is that he stopped sending tribute to the main island for the annual ‚Äòinasi, or ‚Äúfirst fruits‚Äù ceremony. To collect the tribute and institute a new gubernatorial regime on Ha‚Äôapai, the Tu‚Äôi Ha‚Äôatakalaua sent to Ha‚Äôapai three chiefs, collectively known as the ‚ÄòOtu Ha‚Äôapai. The Mata‚Äôuvave was stripped of much of his power and forced out of Uoleva and onto a small tract of land near the southern tip of Lifuka called Lakifue. The remaining Mata‚Äôuvave supporters were supposedly violent towards anyone encroaching on their last piece of property, and the road from Hihifo to Lakifue became known as, and is still known as, Halamate, or the ‚Äúroad of death.‚Äù The Mata‚Äôuvave of Recent Times The Mata‚Äôuvave of 1920, who told many of these stories to Gifford during his collection of genealogical information, was Tuakimoana, who was appointed in 1870 by Kalaniuvalu, the son of Laufilitonga, the last Tu‚Äôi Tonga. ‚ÄúTuakimoana informed Gifford that he had succeeded his mother‚Äôs brother Nehoa whose son and lineal descendant had died. Nehoa was preceded by his older brother Jacob who had replaced a man named Paul Fisilau. Since Tuakimoana, three additional Mata‚Äôuvave have been appointed ‚Äì individuals bearing the personal names of Mano, Ma‚Äôu and Kavaliku. The last, Kavaliku, died in the mid-1980s without heir and the title is now vacant.‚Äù References Category:Tongan royalty ","title":"Mata ªuvave"},{"id":"33266595","text":"Hamad Mohammad Al-Asmar () is a Jordanian footballer of Palestinian who plays for Al-Ahli.

The badge was first created in 1929, with formal regulations for presentation as a decoration formalized from 1933. In addition, the Hitler Youth introduced a number of other awards for merit and proficiency. The public wear of all Nazi Party awards, including the Hitler Youth badge, was banned after 1945. Grades Hitler Youth Badge There were three grades of the Hitler Youth Badge, each a small pinback badge featuring the Hitler Youth emblem and worn on the left breast pocket. =Hitler Youth Badge= This is the standard Hitler Youth Badge denoting membership, particularly for leaders. It could not be worn once the wearer had left the Hitler Youth. The badge shows the Hitler Youth emblem: a golden framed rhomboid having in the centre a golden square field with a black swastika in a red and white field, with a silver-coloured edge. =Golden Hitler Youth Badge= With permission from Hitler on 23 June 1934, the Golden Hitler Youth Badge () was established as an honour award by the National Youth Leader (Reichsjugendf√ºhrer) Baldur von Schirach in recognition of leadership, long service or other special achievements in the Hitler Youth. Recipients included those who joined before 2 October 1932 and who completed five-years unbroken service. It could also be awarded for merit, irrespective of length of service. The badge was numbered on the reverse and is similar in appearance to the standard badge, but edged in gilt rather than silver. The right to wear the Golden Hitler Youth Badge continued after the recipient left the Hitler Youth and no longer wore the uniform. The Leader of the National Hitler Youth could grant the right for the recipient to wear the badge indefinitely. =Golden Hitler Youth Badge with Oakleaves= The Golden Hitler Youth Badge with Oakleaves () was instituted in 1935 to recognise exceptional services to the Hitler Youth. Only about 250 were awarded. The badge is similar to the other badges, but is framed with a narrow border of oakleaves and is of higher workmanship. It was recognised as an official Party decoration, and could therefore be worn on any uniform. Proficiency and other badges Leader's Gold Sports Badge In addition to the Hitler Youth Badge, a number of other awards were instituted, both for proficiency and for notable contributions to the Hitler Youth. =Hitler Youth Leader's Sports Badge in Gold= From January 1937, officers in the Hitler Youth and Jungvolk were required to pass an annual fitness test covering a number of different sports. In May 1938 a special Leader's Sports Badge in Gold () was instituted for award to those officers who achieved the highest scores in these tests. The copper gilt badge consists of a swastika surrounded by a ring bearing the inscription: 'F√ºr Leistunger in der HJ' (For achievers in the HJ) in runic-style script, set in front of a large tiwaz rune, surrounded by a narrow laurel wreath. The reverse is numbered and has a pin for wear on the left breast pocket. Over 11,000 were awarded. =Hitler Youth Proficiency Badge= Proficiency Badge in silver The Hitler Youth Proficiency Badge () was instituted in June 1934 for Hitler Youth members who passed a sports test covering athletics, field craft and rudimentary political knowledge. The badge consists of a swastika surrounded by a ring bearing the inscription: 'F√ºr Leistunger in der HJ' (For achievers in the HJ) in runic- style script, set in front of a large tiwaz rune. The reverse is numbered and has a pin for wear on the breast pocket. It was presented in silver for boys over 17 and bronze for 16 year-olds, with members of the Jungvolk receiving a black version until 1937, when a special Jungvolk badge was introduced. By the end of 1943, 103,061 bronze and 217,093 silver badges had been awarded. =Hitler Youth shooting badges= Sharpshooter badge Hitler Youth shooting awards () were awarded in three grades: * For proficient shooters (F√ºr Sch√ºtzen). Instituted in 1936. It is a circular silver and enamel badge in the shape of a target with, in the centre, the Hitler Youth badge in front of two crossed rifles. By the end of 1943 273,545 had been awarded. * For sharpshooters (F√ºr Scharfsch√ºtzen). Instituted in 1938. Similar to the shooters badge, but edged with a silver wreath. 31,904 were awarded by the end of 1943. * For champion shots (F√ºr Meistersch√ºtzen). Instituted in 1938. Similar to the shooters badge, but edged with a gilt wreath. 852 had been awarded by the end of 1943. * Jungvolk shooting badge (Schiessauszeichnunge des Deutsches Jungvolks). It is similar to the shooters badge, but bears the Jungvolk emblem in front of crossed rifles, flanked with the letters 'D' 'J'. By the end of 1943, there had been 580,872 awards. Each badge was worn on the left breast pocket of the Hitler Youth uniform only. =Hitler Youth Badge for Distinguished Foreigners= A special degree, the Hitler Youth Badge for Distinguished Foreigners (), was authorized in 1941 for presentation to non- German citizens who supported the goals of the Hitler Youth. An oval gilt and enamel badge, it shows a spread eagle above the Hitler Youth emblem. It is edged with a brown band, bearing the words Hitler Jugend.

Formed from parts of the suburbs of Beechboro, Whiteman and West Swan, Originally a subdivision from Beechboro up until 2011 when it was gazetted in April 2011 after a year-long campaign by residents to rename the suburb Bennett Springs. The suburb was named after Matilda Bennett, the wife of John Septimus Roe.New suburb of Bennett Springs ‚Äì City of Swan Media Release. Published 29 April 2011. Retrieved 1 October 2011. The suburb is part of the City of Swan's Urban Growth Corridor and is bounded by Lord Street to the east, Reid Highway to the south, the proposed Tonkin Highway extension to the west and Marshall Road and the former boundary of West Swan to the north. Bennett Brook, also named after Matilda Bennett, runs through part of the suburb. Areas of the suburb Bennett Springs ‚Äì Bennett Springs is a long rectangular chunk of land sandwiched between Reid Highway and Marshall Road, bounded by Bennett Brook on the east and Beechboro Road North on the west. Released from the late 1990s construction began on the east side of the estate making its way to the west and still being developed today, Bennett Springs consists almost entirely of brick and tile 4x2s. Exceptions include occasional two-storey homes, a few 5x2s and a smattering of original dwellings built before the subdivision occurred. Like Orchid Park, the powerlines of Marshall Road are obvious from the northern part of Bennett Springs; in fact selected blocks along Wintergreene, Turnstone, Portland, Driftwood and Oriole Roads actually go underneath the lines. The long-awaited Springs shopping centre has greatly increased the amenity of the subdivision. Beechboro Christian School is also located in the suburb. Birds are the theme for Bennett Springs street names with names such as Fairywren, Whimbrel and Spoonbill. This area also has many parks, and exclusively multiple water fountains running 24/7 which contributes to the name: \\"Bennett Springs\\" Orchid park contains 2 parks while Bennett Springs contains 8 including a major sports field (with football pitch, Australian football field, basketball field, all of whom are covered by solar lights) Orchid Park is a pocket of houses to the northwest. It has one access road being the roundabout turnoff into Orchid Avenue off Beechboro Road North. Orchid Park housing was constructed from around 1989 to 1995, and consists of brick and tile 3x1s and 4x2s. Historically this subdivision was not popular due to its remote location and lack of nearby amenities; however, the recent construction of a shopping centre(Bennett Springs Shopping Centre)opposite the entrance roundabout has changed this. The street names of Orchid Park are named after various types and parts of orchid flowers, such as Niltonia, Denia and Stylis. The Marshall Road powerlines are prominently visible along the boundary of Orchid Park, backing onto parts of Mitra Loop and Orchid Avenue. Orchid Park is now very popular with close proximity to Malaga which has many shops including JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman, Bunnings, Beacon, The Good Guys, Kambo's, Perth Ice Arena and the popular indoor market Malaga Markets.

The appearance of these mounds began in the 12th century but its popularity waned after centuries. By the 1700s, when Europeans began visiting Tonga and recording their observations, the sport was no longer played regularly. By the early 1800s, it was not played at all.David V. Burley, \\"Sport, Status, and Field Monuments in the Polynesian Chiefdom of Tonga: The Pigeon Snaring Mounds of Northern Ha'apai\\", The Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol. 23, No. 4 (Winter, 1996), pp.421-435 The sport All that is known about the extinct sport is comes from one written eye-witness account, one engraving, oral tradition and archaeology. An Englishman named William Mariner who lived in Tonga between 1806 and 1810 described: ::\\"Jia Loobe [sia lupe], catching pigeons with a net. This is not a very usual sport at present, though formerly it used to be. The net used for the purpose is small, with a narrow opening, affixed to the end of a rod of about twelve feet in length. The sportsman who holds it is concealed in a small cabin about five feet high, nearly in form of a bee-hive, in which there is a perpendicular slit dividing it quite in half, by which he can move his rod completely from side to side. There are eight or nine of these cabins, in each of which perhaps, there is a sportsman with his net. The only mode of entrance is by separating the two halves of the cabin from each other. These receptacles are usually situated round the upper part of a raise mount. On the outside of each there is a trained pigeon tied by the leg, and near at hand stands an attendant with another trained bird, tied in like manner to the end of a very long line, which is suffered to fly out to the whole extend of the string, the other end being held by the man. The pigeon thus describes a considerable circle in the air round the mount beneath. The flight of this bird, and the constant cooing of those below, attract a number of wild pigeons to the neighborhood, when the man by checking the string calls in his pigeon, which immediately perches upon his finger. He then conceals himself with the other attendants in a sort of alcove at the top of the mount. The wild pigeons now approaching the tame ones, are caught in the nets by the dexterous management of the sportsmen.\\"John Martin M.D.,Tonga Islands, fourth edition, 1981, pp.380-381 A 1793 engraving by the French Captain D‚ÄôEntrecasteaux corroborates Mariner‚Äôs story. The mounds Pigeon snaring mound in Tongatapu In Tongan, pigeon snaring mounds are called sia heu lupe. The general shape of a pigeon snaring mound was described as ‚Äúmore or less circular platforms, 20-35 m wide and 0.6-5 m high, with a flat top. The characteristic feature of the Tongan pigeon mound is a circular central pit, 5‚Äî7 m in diameter, which has stone-faced walls. Some pigeon mounds in addition have large stone-lined pits filled with large boulders. The function of these structures is unknown.‚Äù The central depression puzzles archaeologists because it is not described in William Mariner‚Äôs account and no one knows how it was used to snare the pigeons. There are also many mounds, especially in Ha‚Äôapai, that do not have the depression. While sia heu lupe can be found throughout Tonga, and even in American and West Samoa, the best studied are those in the Ha‚Äôapai Island Group, where many were constructed in the 15th and 16th centuries by the Mata‚Äôuvave line of chiefs. A 1990-1992 archeological survey of northern Ha‚Äôapai by Simon Fraser University identified two on Nukunamo island, one on the northern tip of Foa Island, none on Lifuka Island, eight on U‚Äôoleva Island, one on Tatafa Island and none on ‚ÄòUiha Island. One of these mounds, called Sialufotu on U‚Äôoleva island, is known as the personal mound the Mata‚Äôuvave and is the largest known sia heau lupe in Tonga. The Simon Fraser study classified mounds into one of three types: mounds with central depression lacking stacked-stone retaining walls, complex mounds with stone retaining walls and access ramps, and flat- topped mounds. As pigeon mounds were created not only for the sport but to project status, the second type would exalt the highest status of the three as it required the highest investment of labor. The Simon Fraser study also found several characteristics of pigeon mounds. \\"First, they were situated in areas without a large, if any, human population and this would have facilitated an expansive cover of forest growth to which pigeons would be attracted‚Ä¶ Second, the mounds were constructed in protected areas that, while within the proximity to the shore, tended toward the center line of the island upon which they were built‚Ä¶ this pattern conforms to the expected flight path of a migrating pigeon flock as it might be pursued by hunters.\\" The culture of pigeon snaring Constructing pigeon snaring mounds required substantial investments of labor from many people, but the sport was tabu, or forbidden, to all but the Tongan chiefs. Any pigeons captured by commoners were to be given to chiefs, and anyone caught eating a pigeon could be punished by \\"whipping or even death\\". The sport could be played for rather basic, small mounds, so the variety in size ornamentation of the mounds is attributed to their projection of status for the chiefs who commissioned their construction. According to one historian, \\"pigeon mounds, together with the royal tombs (langi), can be considered as the highest ranking sites in Tonga.\\" The larger one‚Äôs mound, the higher one‚Äôs status.

The episode was co-written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, while Brad Anderson served as director. In the episode, Olivia is informed by Broyles (Lance Reddick) that the Fringe division of the parallel universe has requested their help to locate a serial killer named John McClennan (John Pyper-Ferguson). With their own universe's John, a university professor, they try to locate the other John with his knowledge of himself while also trying to prevent him of being aware of the alternate universe itself as they cross over. The episode received acclaim from critics who highlighted the performance of Anna Torv's double duty, guest star John Pyper-Ferguson, as well as the exploration of the parallel universe and the use of love and sentimentality that leads to different lifestyle choices. Plot Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) is informed by Broyles (Lance Reddick) that the Fringe division of the parallel universe has requested their help to locate John McClennan (John Pyper-Ferguson), a highly intelligent serial killer who has taken more than 20 victims, drilled into their skull, and killed them by freezing their brains from the inside. The parallel Fringe division wants Olivia to bring the prime universe's version of John, a professor of forensic psychology who specializes in serial-killer profiling, to examine the last known residence of the Parallel John and try to deduce where he may be. Still cautious of the parallel Fringe's intentions, Olivia agrees to help. She meets with the Prime John, explaining their need, but without revealing the existence of the parallel universe. He offers to help, and willingly takes a tranquilizer that puts him to sleep during the transport to the parallel universe through the Machine Room bridge. As Olivia waits with the parallel Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), Fauxlivia dresses as Olivia, and watches over John as he investigates the house. John becomes suspicious that many aspects of the home's owner match his own, but is able to conclude that the owner was jealous of those people who were happy. John reveals that he himself is hiding a dark secret: a need to understand why people are happy. During his abusive childhood, he experienced homicidal urges which he attempted to sate by killing small creatures; he mentions a change in his life that took him into criminal psychology but does not elaborate. When John finds a picture of his father, a farmer, he realizes something is amiss and storms out. Olivia is forced to stop him, and John soon becomes aware that he is in a parallel universe when he sees both Olivias together. They explain to him the crimes of his alternate self. Soon, another victim is taken by Parallel John. Olivia and the parallel Fringe team allow John time to recover in the bathroom before tracking this new case, but soon discover he has escaped. They conclude that John is probably headed towards the remains of his father's farm, and they set out in pursuit. John, meanwhile, has met with his parallel self, who is preparing the latest victim in a makeshift machine that allows him to directly connect to the victim's brain and experience their happy memories but which ultimately kills the victim. The two Johns briefly struggle with the idea of their doppelgangers, but soon learn that while they shared the same youth, their paths diverged when their respective fathers discovered their cache of dead animals. In the parallel universe, John's father caught him and punished him, while in the prime universe, John ran away, stumbling and falling over. He was later rescued by a woman named Marjorie (Enid-Raye Adams), who, even after seeing the dead animals, loved and embraced him, telling him \\"Even when it‚Äôs the darkest, you can step into the light\\", a phrase he has since used to subdue his homicidal urges. The Parallel John becomes jealous of this, knocks his counterpart out, and connects him to the machine. When the Prime John awakes, Parallel John demands he tell him about Marjorie, using the machine to extract this memory from him. Olivia and the Fringe team converge on the farmhouse but find it empty. Nearby they find the remnants of a barn and a storm cellar entrance. Entering it, they find both the kidnap victim, still alive, and the prime version of John, recovering from the trauma, while a shaken parallel version of John cowers nearby, overwhelmed with the impact that Marjorie had on John's life and regretting the murders he has committed. He commits suicide just as the Fringe team finds him. John is returned to the prime universe and taken to a hospital, the incident having caused him to forget the memories of the parallel universe as well as those of Marjorie, though he still remembers what she said to him. Throughout the episode, Walter (John Noble) has covered up every reflective surface in his lab, trying to avoid the vision of Peter (Joshua Jackson) that he sees. In the final scene, Walter starts hearing Peter's voice telling him that he needs his help, leaving Walter even more panicked as to its source. Production \\"One Night in October\\" was co-written by co-executive producers Alison Schapker and Monica Owusu-Breen. Former Fringe producer Brad Anderson directed the episode. Reception =Ratings= \\"One Night in October\\" was watched by 3.1 million viewers, a 1.2 ratings share, approximately 20% less than the 4th-season premiere episode, \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" from the previous week.

Hanson concluded, \\"I cannot talk enough about how much I enjoyed this story...This is Fringe at its best, taking the out-there science fiction concepts and aligning them with a compelling human story. Seriously. Why aren‚Äôt more people watching this show?\\" Entertainment Weekly contributor Jeff Jensen praised Anna Torv's dual performance and called the episode premise \\"clever.\\" Jensen did however express skepticism that they believed McClennan would not suspect he was in a parallel universe. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 called it more interesting than the season premiere and enjoyed the serial killer premise. SFScope's Sarah Stegall wrote, \\"In what may well be the best-written episode of the entire show, Fringe brilliantly exploits its own alternate-world structure to show us the transformative power of love, a power so strong it can redeem the dark impulses that drive a fiend. And it does so with verve and heart, without sappy sentimentality. There is madness and love and tragedy and horror here, all seasoned by some fine performances and top notch writing.\\" Many reviewers praised John Pyper-Ferguson and Anna Torv's performances, with Stegall writing that the former was \\"the best guest star performance\\" on Fringe to date.

Rup and Q have continued to produce successful music and albums including Kabhi (2004), Josh's much-anticipated second album, Mausam (2006), JoSH's third album, and Beyond Kismat, JoSH's most-recent fourth album released in 2010. JoSH has worked on various other projects as well, including a remix of Grammy winner Nelly Furtado's latest singles, \\"Promiscuous Girl\\" and \\"Maneater\\". Among Rup's accomplishments as a member of JoSH include becoming the first Canadian Sikh to win both MTV India and MTV Pakistan awards Rup has also ventured outside of the realm of music to expand his career within the umbrella of the Performing Arts. Acting Rup is in the 2011 sports comedy film Speedy Singhs (also known as Breakaway), directed by Robert Lieberman, starring Vinay Virmani, Russell Peters, Camilla Belle, and Anupam Kher. Rup plays the role of Jassi Singh, a member of the Speedy Singhs hockey team featured in the film. Akshay Kumar, Drake, and Ludacris also make cameo appearances in the film. JoSH recorded the title track for the Speedy Singhs/Breakaway film, titled \\"Chaddi Wale Yaar\\" Author In 2011, Rup released the cookbook Ten Easy Desi Recipes for Guys featuring South Asian cuisine.

He was a member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1938 to 1943. History Frank was the son of C. A. Halleday (1859 ‚Äì 8 November 1924), a nurseryman of Aldgate, South Australia, a successful exhibitor at the Royal Adelaide Show as well as the shows of the various Adelaide Hills Agricultural and Horticultural Societies. He was Chairman of the Mount Lofty Horticultural Society, and a vice-president and life member of the Mount Barker Agricultural and Horticultural Society. He was also one of the founders of the Stirling East Church of Christ, and a trustee of the local cemetery. Halleday's grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. John Halleday, were among the earliest settlers of the Mount Lofty district. Halleday was brought up in Aldgate and left home at the age of 13, working first on a dairy farm, then with the Coast Steamship Company, then the Adelaide Steamship Company at Port Adelaide. He joined the South Australian Railways, working as an attendant at various railway stations, including Mount Lofty, in the Crafers District. He studied accountancy and other commercial subjects at night school. At age 19 he returned to take over his father's business, with some success, but his interests lay more with farm animals, and he sold up the business to take up dairying and pig breeding. He helped set up a bacon curing factory. He entered politics in 1938 as an Independent in the interests of the small farmer for the Southern division of the Legislative Council. He and fellow Independent Alec Bagot campaigned by the then novel method of touring the electorate with a caravan and sound system. He resigned his seat in mid-1943 to contest the Federal seat of Barker. There was no by-election, being so close to the end of his term. His candidature failed, as did his bid to re-enter the Legislative Council in his old seat in April 1944, though he polled well. Subsequent attempts to re-enter Parliament as an independent in 1947 and 1950 for Onkaparinga), 1952 (Stirling) and 1953 (his old Legislative Council seat) failed. Family Halleday married Minnie Clark, daughter of Stanley (1853‚Äì1941) and Agnes W. F. Clark of Aldgate. Their children were eldest daughter Betty Joan (died 1952), Donald, Elva, Ray, and Connie. Halleday had three brothers and four sisters: Herbert Arthur Halleday of Whyte Yarcowie, Rev. Norman Charles Halleday of Western Australia, and Edward A. Halleday (West Coast); Mrs. H.

He funded his own education and became a graduate of Calcutta University. He started writing from his childhood. Debi Roy met Malay Roy Choudhury in an office of a literary periodical in 1960 and the two of them, after discussions with Shakti Chattopadhyay and Samir Roychoudhury launched the now famous Hungryalist movement in November 1961. His Howrah slum-room was the editorial office from where the Hungryalist Bulletins and Hungryalist Manifestoes were published. Along with ten other Hungryalists, Debi Roy was also arrested in 1964 on charges of obscenity in poetry though the trial court exonerated him. He developed new kind of sentences in his poems which have now come to be known as logical breaks as well as image jumping. Subsequent Bengali poets have followed the method into the next century. As a result, he is considered one of the first Postmodern Bengali poet.

The trails were created by Bryson City resident R.T. (Buddy) Abbott, to whom the park is dedicated.Smoky Mountain Times Only accessible by foot bridge, the Island Park is cut off from the mainland by the Tuckasegee River that runs through the center of the Bryson City business district. In 2004, the island was devastated by hurricane like weather and severe flooding from Hurricane Katrina that left the island closed to the public for several years. Up until the year 2008, the Island Park was only accessible by swinging foot bridge, but due to years of weathering a new, fixed concrete bridge was erected to replace the old swinging bridge. Today, the island is home to a slalom course that makes use of the white water rapids, most notably the \\"Devil's Dip\\" rapid.

Angling Anglers enjoy the waters around the island park because of the wide variety of fish species found there, including Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, Brook Trout, Carp, Red Horses, Small and Large mouth Bass, Catfish, White Bass, Walleye, and Rock Bass.

Like all public waters in North Carolina, both natural and artificial lures are allowed, along with no limits on catches, with the exception of trout being a limit of seven.North Carolina Wildlife and Fish Resources Commission Recreation The island park offers a secluded, unspoiled landscape that makes it an ideal spot for picnickers, hikers, and wildlife spotters. The official bird of the state of North Carolina, the Cardinal, can be observed nesting on the island during certain parts of the year. The park offers roughly ten picnic tables along with trash cans and recycling bins. The park offers roughly a mile of dirt trails that circle around the island and through its center. Historic Deep Creek, of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, mouths at the Island Park into the Tuskasegee River. Preservation and Future East Facing Flood Wall In 2005, Bryson City secured two $50,000 grants to be used for introducing some local fauna to the island park. The town also hopes to improve and add to the island's walking paths and gardens, as well as possibly build an outdoor amphitheater on the island, with the hopes of becoming a \\"beautiful, natural focal point in the heart of Bryson City\\".

History =Formation= MUNACA was formed in 1992 and certified as a union by the Quebec Labour Relations Commission in 1993.David Roseman, representing MUNACA Executive Board Its first president, Allan Youster, was a former president of the non-unionized McGill University Non-academic Staff Association (MUNASA) for ten years. =First collective agreement= MUNACA tabled its proposal for a first collective agreement in August 1995. In late summer 1996, MUNACA requested the appointment of a conciliator due to stalled negotiations and a multi-year salary freeze. Conciliation began on September 17, 1996, but the conciliator stated that an impasse had been reached on April 9, 1997 over issues of salary and job security, leading McGill to call in an arbitrator with the authority to set the terms of an agreement. In 1998, MUNACA members voted to engage in pressure campaign, including sizeable protests supported by fellow unions SEIU Local 800 (property services) and AGSEM (teaching assistants). Meanwhile, attrition reduced the size of the union by 500. In February 1999, MUNACA members voted overwhelmingly in favor of a contract which included a retroactive 3.5% salary increase with 1% progression followed by a 1.5% increase with 1.5% progression. The contract eliminated discretionary merit increases, placed greater (but not exclusive) weight on seniority in job selection, and included a compromise on employment security. Non-unionized staff also received largely the same salary increase. =Second collective agreement= Negotiations began for a second collective agreement in November 2002. In September 2003, the university added a new demand to the table: increasing work hours for MUNACA members without additional compensation. In response, MUNACA members authorized pressure tactics, including a protest, and suspended talks until the demand was rescinded. Concern about overwork of MUNACA members was raised by faculty and MUNASA members at the McGill Senate. McGill later withdrew the demand for increased working hours and the parties entered conciliation at McGill's request. In December 2003, MUNACA members overwhelmingly rejected McGill's offer and authorized a strike. They also participated in a voluntary half-day walkout and demonstration. Partly at issue were floating holidays and summer Fridays. Later in December, MUNACA members voted to accept a contract offering 2% scale increases and 2.2-2.5% progressions, along with compensation for the loss of summer Fridays and an increase in salary minima. =Interim= As MUNACA was not affiliated with any larger union, several attempts were made by both members and external unions to affiliate, sometimes leading to strife. Additionally, MUNACA was forced to deal with representatives sending messages judged prejudicial to the good name of the union. In March 2005, MUNACA raised dues by 10% to implement a strike fund in preparation for the next round of negotiations. =Third collective agreement= Negotiations for a third collective agreement began on December 17, 2007. The university originally offered annual scale increases of 2% and progression of 2.5% and reiterated requests for increased work hours and reform of summer Fridays. However, on February 7, 2008, the university tabled new demands, reducing its salary offer to scale increases of 1% and progression of 1-1.5% and requesting an end to employment security for newer employees. After reaching an impasse, the union called a general meeting on August 28, 2008, days before the start of the school year, to vote to reject McGill's offer and authorize pressure tactics, up to and including a strike, in response. With the room filled to capacity and some workers denied entry by security guards due to fire codes, a fire alarm was pulled, forcing an evacuation and preventing the strike vote from taking place. Soon after, an agreement in principle between the negotiation teams was reached including 1-2% scale increases and 1.5% progression, status quo on summer Fridays, night and weekend premiums, and lump sum payments for members at their pay maximum. However, 62% of MUNACA members rejected this proposal at a general assembly, largely due to the disparity in wage increase compared to other jobs at McGill. On September 23, 2008, MUNACA filed for conciliation after the university signaled it would not change its offer. On October 14, 2008, the university responded by offering 2% scale increases and 1% progression for four years, a better offer for employees at their pay maximum. MUNACA rejected this offer after meeting with its Council representatives. After the university responded by offering an 8.5% increase over three years, on December 4, 2008, the general membership voted 68.4% to formally reject the university's offer and 65.1% to authorize pressure tactics up to an including a general strike. In response, MUNACA held several demonstrations and printed several full page ads in major Montreal newspapers. The conciliator recommended a 9% salary increase over three years. Perhaps partly due to fear of striking during an economic downturn, MUNACA members voted 84% to accept the offer, though the recommendation was accepted \\"without enthusiasm\\", according to then-President Maria Ruocco. =Reaction of University Administration - Removal of Senate Representation= Members of MUNACA became ineligible to sit on the McGill Senate upon unionizing, due to regulations permitting staff representation to only non-unionized staff. Because the formation of MUNACA reduced non-unionized staff from 2,719 to 781, the Senate Steering Committee considered the case. The Steering Committee recommended against allowing union members to sit on Senate, partly for fear they would vote as a bloc, and further recommended reducing non-unionized staff representation from six members to three. The recommendation to reduce staff representation was defeated, but MUNACA members remain ineligible to sit on Senate. References External links *LegalEase Radio - On Strike!

He was nominated in 2006 for the prestigious Marcel Duchamp Prize. He also teaches at the European School of Art of Bittany in Quimper, France with his wife Virginie Barr√©. Overview Through his sculptures, drawings and installations Peinado attempts to have viewers experience a different outlook on everyday objects, ideas and communication processes. Most recurrent terms in his joyful activism are to re-appropriate and to accumulate. Works Untitled, Globule Ubiquity Vibrations Peinado could be described as a disc jockey with his continue use of samplers: smileys, disco balls, surf and skateboards, Tetris or Rubik's cube blocks and such are recurrent images in his works. His bootleg-session type of proposals also references pop, minimalist and suprematism art. By twisting these now- iconic images through juxtaposition, they become parts of something new, making a kind of a complex organic system, a parallel world within the exhibition space, rather like a snow globe shaken by artificial weather in a self-contained landscape. Peinado's multidirectional works comment on each other, much as pop culture does with itself, and even the simplest sculpture or image may hold a wide variety of meanings in his hands. For example, one of his best known pieces, One Big World, 2001, representing a Michelin Man posing like a black panther, spoke about the employees firing that the company was heading at the time. On the other hand, by turning the white character into a black one, Peinado acknowledge the real color of tires and the fact that international companies would never have an African originated man representing them. His crossbreed of ideas and forms describe an internal narrative whose meanings are not always clear to viewers, leaving them free to interpret Peinado's dreamscapes. Working his collage-like assemblages, highly influenced by graphic's design copy-paste, the artist underline the lack of cultural purity in today's interconnected society. Still, even working with visual clich√©s and slogans, Peinado tries to encapsulate them in such a way that they become his. In pieces like Speedy Revolution (2006), a vegetable- like turning sculpture, or Good Stuff (2004), a structure made of oversized playing cards inspired by Charles and Ray Eames' 1952 piece, and in Native American dreamcatchers like Sadley (2006), Peinado expresses his own personal life experience and the spirit of his time through the process of assemblage, making disparate elements seem to belong together. These pieces can evoke the creative dynamic itself, and the way certain ideas and images morph into personal fixations and social commentary. As certain memories hit our brain repeatedly, some images of Peinado come back obsessively. The disco ball has taken in his hands the shape of as a skull (Vanityflightcase), a Troyan Horse, 2004, or a turning cement mixer, showing how our brain can manipulate a thought with different and unexpected results. Also, many of his pieces repeatedly appear in different exhibitions along the years, claiming against the tirany of the novelty. The endless loop in which history or a sticky advertising jingle comes back again and again, structuring and feeding our mind, is exposed in his exhibitions. On a formal level, the hyper attractive and very finished surfaces of Peinado's works play against the reality that his art is indeed hand-made, and offers a kind of pop spin on the artistic process in a world of commercial manufacturing, mass production and the illusion of perfection. In Silence is Sexy (2006), an apparent metallic sphere is actually an inflatable balloon. And in California Custom Game Over (2006), a series of minimal-art inspired parallelepipeds are crushed on one side; while the cracks on the crystal surfaces of Black Flag (2008), create a kind of beauty out of chaos. Main solo exhibitions One of Peinado's largest recent exhibitions was Perpetuum Mobile. This installation of installations is like an Alexander Calder mobile for the millennial age, made up of the detritus of a consumerist society. The exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo of Paris in 2004 was actually made of old and new pieces -as said, another characteristic of Peinado's loop strategy- that were placed in an apparent random way throughout the pavilion hall. It had the effect of creating a dialogue about everyday objects (a car, a huge silver-pearl necklace, a black/grey/white rainbow, an advertising billboard, a giant pantone color guide) and familiar images crafted into hanging black cut-outs: a skate boarder, a tree-shaped car air freshener or a body builder. Giant fans would swoosh the pieces and cast breezes on the visitors. In 2006 the Galleria continua at San Gimignano, Tuscany in Italy showed his The Eternal Winter. The title and starting point for Radical Buissonance, FRAC des Pays de la Loire, Carquefou, France (2007), is a neologism, meaning radical bushing-out. In this show, Peinado referred less to everyday objects, relying instead on more symbolic forms and ideas, like a pyramid with its four faces finished on cracked crystal that looked like black marble with white veins. At the peak of the pyramid was a cut-out with the shape of a rhizome -expression of multiplicity (and non-hierarchical interpretation) popularized by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, which also worked as a weathervane giving a counterpoint to the conceptual verticality of the pyramidal structure. Accompanying this piece the viewer could found a flat mirror ball hanging from the ceiling, a backlit anarchy ‚í∂ with the traces fattened to make it look like a clown, L'Auguste (2007); California Game Over (2007), a series of his crushed parallelepipeds, and other sculptures inspired by Memphis' furniture design completed the show. A fog machine clouded the area every now and then, to cloud the space between the objects and to make it more difficult for the viewer to tell the difference between the works. Drawings Beside his impressive sculptures and installations, Peinado is also a highly regarded draftsman. He has collected his watercolors illustrations from 1995 to 2005 into a 1,600-page catalog, Me, myself and I, which playfully assumes the nature of a visual diary.

The procession is characterized by Santa Claus riding a sleigh along the roadway distributing hundreds of colourful balloons to children. Many tourists from across the globe attend the procession annually. Other notable events on the roadway include book fairs held annually. Footpath concerns The road has had concerns over congestion in the footpath adjoining the road due to vegetable sale outlets being run on the footpath.

It was originally broadcast on September 29, 2011 on NBC. Plot Annie Edison is shocked to discover a fellow student, Annie Kim (Irene Choi), is just as smart, perky, and tenacious as she is, and she has already won over the favor of her political science class teacher, Professor Cligoris (Martin Starr).http://www.starpulse.com/news/Matthew_Newlin/2011/09/30/community_recap_geography_of_global_co Annie E. brings Annie K. to the study group, hoping to make friends with her, but instead the two get into a verbal battle of one-ups-manship, and Annie E. asserts that she will be starting a Model United Nations at Greendale. Annie E. later discovers that Annie K. has stolen her idea of the Model UN, and becomes worried that losing out to Annie K. will send her back to the \\"dark side.\\" Jeff offers to intercede and discusses the issue with Cligoris. Professor Cligoris says there is only room at Greendale for one Model UN, so they will have a competition to see which Model UN is the better one. Annie E. convinces the study group, sans Britta, to help out. Britta, meanwhile, has become more committed to her studies, but panics when she sees a flyer for a former friend that is now in prison in Syria. She feels sorry that her friend is being tortured while she is getting a \\"new life\\" and starts to act rambunctiously, such as kicking a trash can or staging a demonstration in the school halls. These actions only please newly appointed security guard Chang, but Britta denies that she will actually break a law, preventing Chang from actually detaining her. The Model UN challenge starts; as the study group gets into their roles, Abed postulates how there can be two UNs, to which Cligoris claims that each UN represents a parallel world. The two teams are given random conflicts, and their ability to work together to resolve the conflict with the best results is used to determine their score. Annie E. and the study group appear ready to win when one of them farts; no one fesses up and the group laughs at it, breaking their attention. Annie gets upset at the group, but Jeff tells her she's acting like a school girl, causing her to run away. Jeff follows her to the study room and apologizes. Annie worries that she is acting like a school girl, but Jeff asserts that he sees her as more mature than that. They realize they have romantic feelings for each other but decide to stay at a comfortable distance, and then return to the competition. Now close to losing, Abed comes up with a plan; as a group, they appear at Annie K.'s UN as representatives from their parallel world, offering to make peace with this UN. Annie K. refuses to do so, but Professor Cligoris sees Annie E.'s actions as appropriate \\"empty promises\\" that the UN was built on, and asserts Annie E.'s team the winner. Their celebration is interrupted as Britta, covered in dolls, disrupts the proceedings. Chang happily tasers her for disrupting the students. Production The episode was written by producer Andy Bobrow, his fourth writing credit for the series. It was directed by executive producer Joe Russo, his 17th directing credit for the series. Reception The episode received positive reviews from the critics. Steve Heisler, of NYMag, said of the episode, \\"The problem I‚Äôve always had with Community ‚Äî admittedly a minor one ‚Äîis that it‚Äôs often so obsessed with wit and style that the show reads as disingenuous. Sure, they‚Äôre a hell of a lot of fun, but episodes can feel empty without pathos or a real, grounded sense of empathy. But as last week‚Äôs show-stopping musical number promised, this is a whole new Community, and the show is ready to make amends for its past mistakes. (I‚Äôm choosing to ignore the part where the dean said the show was going to be just like last year, only with less money.) ‚ÄúGeography of Global Conflict‚Äù wasn‚Äôt necessarily an unstoppable joke machine like Community at its best, nor was it a tear gas-canister full of emotion. But the episode teased what will likely carry on throughout the season: a reevaluation of character relationships and maybe, just maybe, some real heart.

Biography Puspa was born with the name Sudarwati in Tanjung, South Kalimantan on 1 November 1937 to Tugeno Puspowidjojo and Siti Mariam. Her family later changed her name to Kadarwati and then finally Sumarti. As a child, she wanted to be a kindergarten teacher. However, after winning several singing competitions she decided to become an entertainer, making the decision around age 14. Her parents forbade her from doing so. After winning the Radio Republik Indonesia singing competition in Semarang, Central Java, Puspa was asked by Sjaiful Bachri of the Jakarta Symphony Orchestra to sing for them. After her performance of Ismail Marzuki's song \\"Chandra Buana\\", the group elected to keep her as their regular singer. She left the orchestra in 1962. Her stage name was chosen by President Sukarno during the 1950s. In 1957 Puspa married Zainal Ardhy, a Radio Republik Indonesia employee. By 1963 they had two daughters. During this period Puspa began to study songwriting, learning from her husband. Aside from singing and songwriting, Puspa also acts. In 2009, Puspa was diagnosed with cervical cancer. After several months of treatment, including two months of chemotherapy at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore (where she wrote 61 songs), she was declared to be free of cancer. She credits her prayer and meditation in the hospital for her success at fighting cancer. Songwriting In a 2008 interview with Bruce Edmond of The Jakarta Post, Puspa stated that \\"[s]ongs are my medicine, my vitamins, they make my life better.\\" Legacy Puspa with Bing Slamet; their friendship inspired her to write \\"Bing\\" after the latter's death. Puspa has been described as \\"the grand dame of Indonesian entertainment\\". In 1963 the Indonesian variety magazine Varia described her name and voice as \\"inseparable\\", writing that listeners would stop their activities to focus on her songs when played on the radio. Alberthiene Endah wrote a biography of Puspa, entitled \\"A Legendary Diva\\". It was released in 2008. Two of Puspa's songs, \\"Kupu-Kupu Malam\\" (\\"Nighttime Butterflies\\", from the album of the same name) and \\"Bing\\" (from Cinta) were selected as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time by Rolling Stone Indonesia in 2009. \\"Kupu-Kupu Malam\\" was ranked 32nd; the write-up noted that the song was an unbiased look at prostitution in Indonesia, with Puspa's vocals at times as if she were holding back tears and at other times roaring with strength. \\"Bing\\", Puspa's tribute to Bing Slamet, was ranked 41st and described as being capable of expressing her feelings of loss without coming across as overly emotional.

This has led to the extensive use of brine shrimp in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored for long periods and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans. From cysts, brine shrimp nauplii can readily be used to feed to fish and crustacean larvae just after one-day incubation. Instar I (the nauplii that just hatched and with large yolk reserves in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, for the reasons they are easy for operation, nutrients rich, and of small size which makes them suitable for feeding fish and crustacean larvae live or after drying. Diet Brine shrimp cyst In their first stage of development, brine shrimp nauplii do not feed but consume their own energy reserves stored in the cyst. Wild brine shrimp eat microscopic planktonic algae. Cultured brine shrimp can also be fed particulate foods including yeast, wheat flour, soybean powder or egg yolk. Reproduction Adult female brine shrimp ovulate approximately every 140 hours. In favourable conditions, the female brine shrimp can produce eggs that almost immediately hatch. While in extreme conditions, such as low oxygen level or salinity above 150‚Ä∞, female brine shrimp produce eggs with a chorion coating which has a brown colour. These eggs, also known as cysts, are metabolically inactive and can remain in total stasis for two years while in dry oxygen-free conditions, even at temperatures below freezing. This characteristic is called cryptobiosis, meaning \\"hidden life\\". While in cryptobiosis, brine shrimp eggs can survive temperatures of liquid air () and a small percentage can survive above boiling temperature () for up to two hours. Once placed in briny (salt) water (>5‚Ä∞), the eggs hatch within a few hours. The nauplii, or larvae, are less than 0.4 mm in length when they first hatch. Brine shrimp have a biological life cycle of one year. Nutritional benefits Since no artificial feed formulation is yet available to completely substitute for brine shrimp, feeding live prey to young fish and crustacean larvae still remains essential in commercial hatchery operation. The nutritional properties of newly hatched brine shrimp are high in lipids and unsaturated fatty acids . Dried brine shrimp nauplii contain 37%‚Äì71% protein, 12%‚Äì30% lipid, 11%‚Äì23% carbohydrate, and 4%‚Äì21% ash. The fatty acid compositions of the nauplii are highly environmentally determined. Also the nutritional quality of commercially available brine shrimp strains being relatively poor in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), and especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). Since these components are critical for the larvae development, it is common practice to feed this live prey with emulsions of marine oils that are rich in the EPA and DHA, which is referred as enrichment processes. Industrial hatchery Since the development of commercial marine fish culture in the late 1970s, the demand for brine shrimp cysts has gradually increased from a few tonnes to approximately 800 tonnes per annum, representing approximately 40% of the total aquaculture demand for feeds for early stages. The price of the cysts varies during the last a few decades depending on both demand and the quality of the cysts. During the last 25 years, the Great Salt Lake in the United States has been the major supplier of brine shrimp cysts to the world aquaculture industry and the subject of numerous speculations regarding its capacity to sustain a growing aquaculture industry. However, due to the unpredictable fluctuation of the cyst yield from Great Salt Lake, there are other sites for cyst production, such as Lake Urmia in Iran, Aibi Lake in China, Bolshoye Yarovoye in Siberia, Kara Bogaz Gol in Turkmenistan, and several lakes in Kazakhstan. Although hatchery process of brine shrimp are relative simple and easy to operate, a series of factors need to be controlled and monitored to make optimal use of the cysts. The critical factors are light, temperature, salinity, oxygen level, pH and cyst density, which vary between different brine shrimp strains. Hatching quality can be described by hatching efficiency (number of nauplii per gram of cysts), hatching percentage or hatching synchrony (time between first and last hatching cysts). There are six stages in the hatching and development of brine shrimp industrial hatchery. After hatching, and prior to feeding them to the fish or crustacean larvae, brine shrimp nauplii should be separated from the hatching wastes. After switching off the aeration in the hatching tank, cyst shells will float and nauplii will concentrate at the bottom of the tank. The nauplii are further concentrated in a concentrator rinse and separated from the cysts. The enrichment process, if needed, generally occurs after the nauplii develop a digestive tract. The three main enrichment approaches are listed below.

The film stars Joachim Hansen and Marianne Koch and was directed by Alfred Weidenmann, whose film career began in the Nazi era. Der Stern von Afrika was premi√®red on 13 August 1957 in Berlin and was popular at the German box office. Plot The film begins shortly before the outbreak of World War II with Jochen Marseille (Joachim Hansen) attending a Luftwaffe (Air Force) school in Berlin. His squadron is transferred to the Africa Corps in North Africa. Marseille quickly becomes the most successful fighter pilot. His unit loses more and more pilots to the Desert Air Force, and Marseille begins to doubt the usefulness of his operations. He travels to Berlin to receive a high military decoration where he falls in love with a teacher, Brigitte (Marianne Koch). The couple go to Rome where Marseille is to receive a decoration. The distraught Brigitte tries to persuade him to defect, but he returns to North Africa. During a flight over Egypt, his aircraft suffers an engine failure and crashes. Marseille attempts to take to his parachute but his body is later found in the desert. Brigitte receives the news of his death.

Weidenmann had directed his first feature film for the , Hauptamt Film in 1942. As specialists for propaganda specifically targeting the German youth both teamed up as writer and director in 1944 to make Junge Adler (Young Eagles), one of the most successful and renowned Nazi propaganda movies. After the war Weidenmann helped Reinecker to reenter the film business. During the 1950s they did several movies of various genres together, among them documentaries, comedies and crime films, but also the spy movie Canaris (1954). Reinecker based his script of Der Stern von Afrika upon a \\"factual report\\" by journalist Udo Wolter in the magazine Revue. Several actors, who would later become well known stars of German cinema and television such as Hansj√∂rg Felmy and Horst Frank, made their screen debut with Der Stern von Afrika. The Cuban Roberto Zerquera, who was cast by Weidenmann on the spot when they accidentally met on an aircraft, would later make a career in Germany as a singer under the stage name Roberto Blanco. The movie was edited by Carl Otto Bartning, who had worked on the Nazi aviation propaganda movies Feuertaufe and Kampfgeschwader L√ºtzow with director Hans Bertram. In 1941, Bartning had also collaborated with effects cameraman Karl Ludwig Ruppel to make the semidocumentary Front am Himmel (Front in the Sky). Ruppel worked on Der Stern von Afrika. Here he used British traveling matte techniques to incorporate model airplanes. Mechanical effects and explosives were designed by Erwin Lange, who had also worked on Pour le M√©rite (1938), Stukas (1941), Quax the Crash Pilot (1941) and Kolberg (1943-44) and would continue to be involved in war movies like Paths of Glory (1957), Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever? (1958), Die Br√ºcke (1959) as well as The Vikings (1957) and Cleopatra (1960-1962). Eduard Neumann, the former Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) of Jagdgeschwader 27 (27th fighter wing) and Marseille's commanding officer, served as a technical advisor on the film. Der Stern von Afrika was produced by the Neue M√ºnchner Lichtspielkunst GmbH - Neue Emelka. For financing the Neue Emelka applied to the Berliner Revisions- und Treuhand Aktiengesellschaft through which the Federal Republic of Germany granted loans for movie projects. To the Treuhand the Neue Emelka advertised its project as a kind of counter movie to Des Teufels General. Their film, they claimed, would be indispensable to foster military preparedness. The application was turned down, however, because the German Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence admonished the script. The producers managed to raise the production cost of DM 1,3 million by themselves, not at least because they received support from Francoist Spain. The Spanish Air Force provided aircraft, pilots, personnel and any military material needed. Release A first version of Der Stern von Afrika was screened to representatives of the German Ministries of Defence and the Interior on 20 February 1957. The Ministry of Defence asked for several cuts, because it feared the film would tend to romanticization and could provoke the impression that it followed Nazi German propaganda suggesting the invasion of Poland was somehow provoked by Polish attacks. The ministry further asked that any reference to Hitler would be left out and that the film would not end with a scene in which Marseille's fianc√© receives the message of his death while teaching a school class.W√ºbbe 2001, p. 387. It was perceived that this would lead the audience to conclude that the children of the 1940s were to become soldiers again in the present. In general, however, both ministries now supported the film, which they considered to be an authentic portrayal of the spirit of German fighter pilots in 1942. They saw and acknowledged in it a general tendency to depict the hardships and problems of the war, while positively honoring the human value of soldierly achievements and comradeship. With that endorsement, the Emelka applied for a final grant from the Treuhand. It was once again turned down, most likely because the Treuhand feared that the film would be banned out of political concerns. In fact, in May 1957 the Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (FSK) initially did not approve the film, because it perceived \\"national socialist tendencies\\" and, in particular, because it thought that the historical situation was inappropriately distorted. It is neither clear, how the FSK came to that conclusion, nor what made it change its mind, but the film was approved soon after. In June 1957, the Press and Information Agency of the Federal Government (Bundespresseamt) provided for the last DM 300,000 needed for post- production, but ensured that it would not be publicly involved by channeling the money through a private bank and another company. The film distributor advertised Der Stern von Afrika by claiming that \\"it had been about time, that a German production showed how splendid the German fighter pilots actually had been, the more so, as we can present the absolute world record holder in this field, the Captain Hans-Joachim Marseille\\". The movie premiered on 13 August 1957 in Hannover with Marseille's mother attending. Reception Der Stern von Afrika proved to be successful at the box office. Newspapers reported that the audiences were \\"most pleasantly shaken\\", while younger viewers were enthused. Der Stern von Afrika was criticised by reviewers, however, who had hoped for a critical confrontation with the past. Critics pointed to the past collaborations of director Alfred Weidenmann and writer Herbert Reinecker and noted the similarities between Stern von Afrika and Young Eagles (Junge Adler). They spoke of the \\"teutonic glorification\\" of the film, likened it to the propaganda style under Goebbels and speculated that the Der Stern von Afrika would not have looked much different, should the Nazis have won the war. The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung commented that \\"now they're flying again, and they're falling again, they do it most discreetly and no blood flows\\". In the Berlin Tagesspiegel Karena Niehoff concluded, that the movie might not endorse the Nazis on war, but that it did not explicitly oppose neither. Weidenmann himself claimed in an interview that he was attempting an act of \\"spiritual cleansing\\", because \\"in history there are no completely new beginnings, only continuations.\\" The Frankfurter Rundschau commented: \\"One leaves the movie theatre thinking, that it has been Marseille today, in two years it could be - if one is simply continuing - Sepp Dietrich.\\" According to critics, they unanimously believed that Weidenmann's portrayal of history in Der Stern von Afrika evoked dangerous continuities and was to clean up the past from National Socialism. The FSK was criticized for not restricting the movie to audiences under 18. References ;Citations ;Bibliography   * Tate, Robert (2008).

Overall he has won 18 medals ‚Äì 5 gold, 6 silver and 7 bronze at different international contests. Sarlak began his Judo practice in 1994 at the age of 13 in Tehran, Iran, and earned his first silver medal at the Asian Youth Championships in 2000 in Hong Kong. Since then he competed in Judo tournaments earning international awards. He came close to winning the gold medal at the 2005 World Judo Championships in Cairo. However, because of the Iranian government's political issues with Israel, Sarlak was ordered by the Iranian Federation to lose to his Azerbaijani competitor to avoid competing against an Israeli opponent in the next round. Sarlak continued to compete internationally, and in 2009, after achieving 5th place in the World Championships at Rotterdam, Netherlands, he expatriated from Iran due to the effect his country's political issues had on his career. Later he became a legal resident of the German Judo Federation and shortly thereafter joined the German Bundesliga Judo team. Sarlak has stated in interviews that he is not politically minded but believes that political divergence or agendas should not interfere with sports or any public occasion where different cultures and nationalities connect. He is quoted as saying, \\"Judo is a sport in which manners and respecting the other is the first lesson. Asian, African, American, etc. are all human beings and if there are any existing issues, it should be handled when stepping on the tatemi!\\" Sarlak was the head coach of Tajikistan's national judo team in 2019 World Judo Championships in Tokyo.

Engraving by Adriaen Haelwegh. Cornelis Bontekoe (1640/1647 in Alkmaar ‚Äì 13 January 1685 in Berlin), whose real name was Cornelis Dekker, was a Dutch physician known also as a popular essayist, particularly on tea, and editor of the works of Arnold Geulincx. He applied what were generally Cartesian theories in medicine, but with innovations such as a purely hydraulic and muscular explanation of the mechanism of the heart.Thomas Fuchs and Marjorie Glicksman Grene, The Mechanization of the Heart: Harvey and Descartes (2001), p. 154; Google Books. Life In an itinerant and stormy life, Bontekoe, who took his pseudonym from the spotted cow on the sign of his Mennonite father Gerrit Dekker‚Äôs grocery shop in Alkmaar, courted controversy and agitated for reform and more modern thinking in medicine. He studied first at the University of Leiden under Franciscus Sylvius and Geulincx, graduating M.D. in 1667. In conflict with the medical men of Alkmaar, he moved his practice. He studied for a second period at Leiden from 1674, where Theodoor Craanen was teaching. His vocal opposition to Aristotelian teaching saw him banned at Leiden, with Johannes Swartenhengst, in 1675. He was, however, readmitted in 1676 to the university, where his follower Heydentryk Overcamp graduated M.D. in 1677. Bontekoe's Tractaat advocating tea-drinking appeared in 1678, and made his reputation. Via Amsterdam he moved to Hamburg, where he wrote a work against the concept of climacteric year, which he dedicated to Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg. The Elector rewarded him with positions as court physician and as professor at the University of Frankfurt an der Oder. Bontekoe moved to Prussia. He had patients in Berlin-C√∂lln and died there, after an accident related to his copious tea-drinking. References * *Cornelis Bontekoe (1647 ‚Äì 1685) at the Spinoza website.

Pilate's superscription is nailed to the cross above Jesus. ''''' (Latin for \\"What I have written, I have written\\") is a Latin phrase. It was most famously used by Pontius Pilate in the Bible in response to the Jewish priests who objected to his writing on the sign (titulus) that was hung above Jesus at his Crucifixion. It is mostly found in the Latin Vulgate Bible. It is equivalent to the Latin expression Dixi (Latin for \\"I have said\\"), meaning that the speaker has spoken and there is no more to be said. John 19:20) and affixed to the cross; Ellwangen Abbey, Germany  History  The phrase appears in the Bible in John 19:20-22\\\\. When Jesus was sent to be crucified, Pilate wrote the sign to be hung above Jesus on the cross. He wrote \\"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\\" in Hebrew (or, more correctly, AramaicThe HarperCollins Study Bible, New Revised Standard Version, , page 2051), Latin and Greek. The Jewish priests voiced their objections of this to Pilate, stating that Jesus had only claimed the title and they did not recognise Him as such. They said to Pilate \\"Do not write King of the Jews, but that he said: 'I am the King of the Jews'.\\" Pilate responded to them sternly with \\"Quod scripsi, scripsi\\" (, Ho gegrapha gegrapha). This was interpreted by Jerome as an allusion to the headings of Psalm 56 and Psalm 57, which in the Vulgate seem to refer to an inscription that is not to be changed. The scene where Pilate says \\"Quod scripsi, scripsi\\" was not covered in art or discussion as a popular subject. Aside of the Bury St. Edmunds Cross there was little discussion on it in the pre-Reformation Christian Church. It was suggested that this may have been because it is only mentioned in detail by St. John the Evangelist and because it was mentioned in the apocryphal Acts of Pilate.  Other uses  In 1306, when Henry II of Jerusalem signed a patent to give the Kingdom of Cyprus to the governorship of Amalric, Prince of Tyre, the Marshal of the Temple accompanying Amalric reportedly said \\"Quod scripsi, scripsi\\" with disdain to Henry when he signed the patent. On being released from imprisonment in 1418, Antipope John XXIII came, broken down and destitute, to Florence, and was given an asylum there by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, who, when the deposed Pope died in the following year, erected to his memory the tomb which is to be seen in the Florence Baptistery. When the inscription was put up (after Giovanni's death), Pope Martin V objected to the words \\"Quandam Papa\\" (former Pope) and wrote to the Signoria demanding that they should be erased. The reply was a refusal, written by Cosimo de' Medici, and couched in the words of Pontius Pilate, saying, \\"Quod scripsi, scripsi.\\" The philosopher Immanuel Kant used a play on \\"Quod scripsi, scripsi\\" in response to critics of his Metaphysics of Morals, using \\"Quod scripsi, scribentes\\" (What I have written, I am writing). Jos√© Saramago started his 1991 novel The Gospel According to Jesus Christ with this quote, both as a reference to Pilate's writing, but also as an answer to the criticism he anticipated.

He was stadhouder of Holland and Zeeland, but is mainly known as the fourth husband of countess Jacqueline of Holland. He was the son of Floris van Borssele and Oda van Bergen, Lord of Sint Maartensdijk, Scherpenisse (both now districts of Tholen) and Zuylen. He was the last legitimate representative of the younger branch of the Borssele family. After succeeding her father, Jacqueline of Hainaut's authority was challenged by her uncle John III in the 1420s. In her place, her second husband John IV, Duke of Brabant appointed John III as ruler of Holland and Zeeland. From late 1421 to early 1423 Frank van Borssele played an essential role in the financial government of the county, as he was a loyal supporter of John III and Philip the Good. In 1422/23 he was alderman of Count John III and official governor of the country. The height of his power, however, were the years 1426 to 1432. Philip the Good had taken over the position of regent of Holland and Zeeland after the death of John III and on 21 March 1426 Frank was appointed by Philip the Good as General and Grandcaptain of Zeeland. In 1428 Jacqueline recognized in the Treaty of Delft, which left her Countess only in name, with Frank van Borssele as the regent of her lands. This gave him more power and more control over the counties' finances. In 1430 Borssele was the Burgundian stadhouder and \\"Opperhoutvester\\" of Holland, in the same year he became lord of Gorinchem, Leerdam, de Leede and Schoonrewoerd. In the summer of 1432, the power of Frank van Borssele reached its peak. Philip the Good, fearful of yet another pretender to the titles of Count of Holland and Zeeland kidnapped Frank and incarcerated him in Flanders. Legend later tells another story in which Frank and Jacqueline of Hainaut fell in love and secretly married in 1432. However, if this were the case, the consequences for Frank would have been far more severe. He would have been executed and Jacqueline incarcerated for life. Instead, his incarceration had to do with the duke being fearful of him gaining too much power. He was released in 1433 and his properties were restored.D.E.H. de Boer, E.H.P.

Janse, Een Pion voor een Dame, 2009, p. 288-326, Jacqueline of Hainaut and Frank van Borssele did get married in 1434 after she renounced all her titles (1433) and with approval of the duke of Burgundy. This marriage, which was ‚Äì at least from Jacqueline's side ‚Äì one made out of love, did not last long.A. Janse, p. 326, Graven van Holland, p. 143 Jacqueline died on October 9, 1436.

He served as a member of the Northwest Territories Council from 1966 to 1975. His book based on his experiences, Nunaga (1971), has been reprinted several times. Early life Duncan McLean Pryde was born on June 8, 1937 in Dunbartonshire, Scotland. He was raised in an orphanage along with four brothers and a sister. He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of 15 and eventually covered himself with tattoos. Pryde remained for three years in the Merchant Navy, then was forced to resign due to an eye injury, and went to work for Singer Corporation in the Clydebank sewing machine factory. He left Singer at the age of 18 in 1955 after seeing an advertisement in The Sunday Post looking for traders to work for the Hudson's Bay Company in the Canadian North. After arriving in Canada, Pryde spent three years working in Ontario and Manitoba where he learned to speak the Cree language before transferring to the Northwest Territories. After moving to the Arctic, determined to learn Inuktituk or Eskimo as it was then known, Pryde began writing his own dictionary after being given a poorly written dictionary by a Catholic Missionary. Pryde began adopting the way of life of the Inuit and learned the skills to live off the land. He became fluent in communication after three or four years. He also fathered a number of children with Inuit women. Political career Pryde's political career began in 1966. The Northwest Territories opened up territorial elections for the first time in the Eastern Arctic after amendments to the Northwest Territories Act. Pryde was elected by Acclamation for a by-election held on September 19, 1966 in the new electoral district of Central Arctic. Pryde was unable to make ends meet from the meager salary paid to members of the Council, a substantial pay decrease from the Hudson's Bay Company. While serving on Council he continued to live a nomadic Inuit lifestyle. Pryde ran for re-election a year later in the 1967 Northwest Territories general election. He ran in the electoral district of Western Arctic and won his second term in office. Publishings Time magazine made Duncan Pryde internationally recognized by featuring him on the cover of the May 2, 1969 edition of the magazine. Later British journalist Cliff Michelmore filmed a feature about Pryde for British television in 1970. Pryde authored a book on his experience in the Northwest Territories which was first published in 1971. The book was titled Nunaga : Ten Years of Eskimo Life. The name of the book had a few variations and a translation was also published in a number of other languages including Dutch, French, Hungarian, Swedish and Danish. A second edition was published by Eland in 1985, incorporating material that was cut from the first printing. Ed Ogle, the Calgary-based correspondent for Time magazine, was the man behind Duncan's initial publicity success. Ogle told Val Wake, a CBC News reporter based in Yellowknife, that he, Ogle, ghost wrote Pryde's non fiction work \\"Nunaga: Ten Years of Eskimo Life.\\" Shortly after the book was published in 1972 rumours about Ogle's authorship circulated in Yellowknife. Ed Ogle accused Val Wake of revealing his secret. Val Wake maintained he never did. During Val Wake's four-year stint in Yellowknife, 1969 to 1973, Duncan Pryde was a constant source of \\"good copy\\". He married an First Nations woman, Georgina Blondin in 1969. The book Nunaga is dedicated to Gina which was Duncan Pryde's pet name for her. The couple were guests for an official dinner when Queen Elizabeth visited Yellowknife in 1970. Georgina presented the Queen with an armful of white Arctic fox furs, a gift from the Northwest Territories Government. The couple divorced in 1975.Ancestry records of Duncan Pryde‚Äôs family tree Before Duncan and Georgina became a couple, he had relationships with a number of Inuit women, by whom he had several children. In Yellowknife Duncan Pryde sometimes boasted about his Arctic children with the phrase: \\"every woman should have a bit of Pryde in them.\\" Val Wake found these claims objectional, especially as Duncan Pryde apparently did nothing to support his children. Wake's reporting of Pryde's activities as a member of the Territorial Council became less positive. Pryde later moved to Alaska to work on his dictionary at the University of the Arctic. He had problems with Immigration and was forced to leave the United States until his residency issues were settled. Later life After leaving Alaska, Pryde moved back to the United Kingdom and moved in with his brother in London. He had trouble adjusting away from northern life but never returned to the Arctic. Pryde met his second wife and moved to the Isle of Wight, setting up a newspaper shop called Pryde of Cowes and continuing work on his dictionary. He lived a quiet life and ended up losing touch with his United Kingdom family. Pryde died on November 15, 1997. References This article appears to be based on his obituary in The Independent here.

The architecture of Warsaw has influenced and reflected the history of Polish architecture. The city of Warsaw features prominent buildings in a variety of styles by many important architects. Warsaw's palaces, churches and mansions display a richness of color and architectural details. Buildings are representatives of nearly every European architectural style and historical period. The city has wonderful examples of architecture from the gothic, renaissance, baroque and neoclassical periods, all of which are located within easy walking distance of the town centre.  Architecture by style  Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications. The most significant buildings are St. John's Cathedral (14th century), the temple is a typical example of the so-called Masovian gothic style, St. Mary's Church (1411), a town house of Burbach family (14th century), Gunpowder Tower (after 1379) and the Royal Castle Curia Maior (1407‚Äì1410). The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of Baryczko merchant family (1562), building called \\"The Negro\\" (early 17th century) and Salwator tenement (1632). The most interesting examples of mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle (1596‚Äì1619) and the Jesuit Church (1609‚Äì1626) at Old Town. Among the first structures of the early baroque the most important are St. Hyacinth's Church (1603‚Äì1639) and Zygmunt's Column (1644). Church of St. Anthony of Padua in Warsaw-Czerniak√≥w with profuse frescoes and stucco decorations, was constructed in 1690-1693. Building activity occurred in numerous noble palaces and churches during the later decades of the 17th century. One of the best examples of this architecture are Krasi≈Ñski Palace (1677‚Äì1683), Wilan√≥w Palace (1677‚Äì1696) and St. Kazimierz Church (1688‚Äì1692). The unique character of Warsaw Baroque, which gradually influenced the architecture of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was a mixture of local traditions with Western European patterns. Late Baroque architecture with palaces merging Polish mansions of the aristocracy with side towers, Italian suburban villa and a French palace entre cour et jardin (between court and garden) with two oblong wings on each side of the cour d'honneur, funeral chapels, modelled after Sigismund's Chapel and attached to the church as well as Greek-cross plan churches, are present in Warsaw. The style was largely shaped by one individual Tylman Gamerski, showing Italian and Dutch influences. The most impressive examples of rococo architecture are Czapski Palace (1712‚Äì1721), Palace of the Four Winds (1730s) and Visitationist Church (fa√ßade 1728‚Äì1761). Holy Trinity Evangelical Church was constructed in 1777‚Äì1782. The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period. The first stage, called the Stanislavian style, followed by an almost complete inhibition and a period known as the Congress Kingdom classicism. The palladian patterns were independently interpreted by Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug, who followed an influence of radical French classicism. A palladian by influence was also Piotr Aigner - author of the facade of St. Anne's Church in Warsaw (1786‚Äì1788) and St. Alexander Church (1818‚Äì1826). Palladian ideas were implemented in a popular type of a palace with a pillared portico. Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the Palace on the Water (rebuilt 1775‚Äì1795), Kr√≥likarnia (1782‚Äì1786), Carmelite Church (fa√ßade 1761‚Äì1783) and Evangelical Holy Trinity Church (1777‚Äì1782). The economic growth during the first years of Congress Poland caused a rapid rise architecture. The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture, the most notable are the Great Theater (1825‚Äì1833) and buildings located at Bank Square (1825‚Äì1828). Warsaw Philharmony edifice in 1918. The building was destroyed in a German air raid on Warsaw in 1939 and it was rebuilt after the war in the socialist realism style Exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war (like mentioned Kronenberg Palace and Insurance Company Rosja building) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style (like Warsaw Philharmony edifice originally inspired by Palais Garnier in Paris). Despite that the Warsaw University of Technology building (1899‚Äì1902) is the most interesting of the late 19th-century architecture. Lot of the 19th- century buildings is restored in Praga (Vistula‚Äôs right bank), though they are in a pretty bad condition. Warsaw‚Äôs municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild the Saxon Palace and the Br√ºhl Palace, the most distinctive buildings in prewar Warsaw. After the Warsaw area enlargement in 1916, an occasion was aroused to build new estates. Yet in 20's and 30's new workers' and villas' estates came into existence. Thanks of this the villas' estate was built in Saska Kƒôpa. Most prewar building at this district was not destroyed during war. Nowadays still exists many examples of houses from interwar period, designed by notable architects, like Bohdan Pniewski, Bohdan Lachert, J√≥zef Szanajca, Lucjan Korngold or Szymon and Helena Syrkus.

A member of a prominent family of musicians, Predieri was born in Bologna and was active there from 1704. In 1737 he moved to Vienna, eventually becoming Kapellmeister to the imperial Habsburg court in 1741, a post he held for ten years. In 1765 he returned to his native city where he died two years later at the age of 78. A prolific opera composer, he was also known for his sacred music and oratorios. Although his operas were largely forgotten by the end of his own lifetime and most of their scores lost, individual arias as well some of his sacred music are still performed and recorded. Life Predieri's uncle and teacher, Giacomo Cesare Predieri The son of Vitale Predieri and Maria Menzani, Predieri was born in Bologna to a prominent family of musicians which included organist and composer Giacomo Maria Predieri (1611‚Äì1695), singer Antonio Predieri (1650‚Äì1710), singer and composer Angelo Predieri (1655‚Äì1731), and singer and composer Giacomo Cesare Predieri (1671-1753). He studied the violin with Abondio Bini and Tommaso Vitali, and counterpoint with Giacomo Cesare Predieri, Angelo Predieri, and Giacomo Antonio Perti. He is recorded as having been a viola player in the orchestra of the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna at the age of 16 and later served as a violinist there from 1706 to 1711.Schnoebelen (2001) By 1715 he had composed his first oratorio, Santi Cipriano e Giustina (Saints Cyprian and Justina), and five operas, the first of which, La Partenope,Queen Parthenope, a siren and the legendary founder of Naples inaugurated the Marsigli-Rossi theatre on 28 October 1710. Predieri's compositions gained him an appointment to the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna in 1716. In 1723 he was elected its Principe (literally \\"Prince\\", but the Academy's traditional name for its presiding officer)Schnoebelen (2001); Godt and Rice (2010) p. 277 In addition to his duties at the Accademia, Predieri served as the maestro di capella (music director) at various churches in Bologna including San Paolo Maggiore, Madonna di Galliera, Santa Maria della Vita, and lastly the Cathedral of San Pietro. By the time he left Bologna in 1737 he had composed 25 operas, five oratorios, many pieces of church music, and several secular instrumental works. Predieri became known in Vienna through performances there of his operas, Amor Prigioniero in 1731, and Il sogno di Scipione, first performed in 1735 as part of the birthday celebrations for Emperor Charles VI.Eisen and Keefe (2006) p.462 Following the death of Antonio Caldara in December 1736, Johann Fux (at the time Kapellmeister to Charles VI), invited Predieri to Vienna to serve as his assistant. Predieri arrived there towards the end of 1737 and in 1739 was officially appointed Vice Kapellmeister, the post previously held by Caldara. On Fux's death in 1741, he assumed to the duties of Kapellmeister, although he did not use the official title until 1746. During his time in Vienna he composed several more operas, often performed to mark special occasions at the imperial court, two oratorios, a Stabat Mater, and many other pieces of sacred music. Predieri retired as Kapellmeister in 1751, but kept his title and his salary for the remainder of his time in Vienna even though Georg Reutter had taken over his duties.Schnoebelen (2001); Carter (1990) pp. 65 & 68 In 1765, he returned to his native Bologna where he died on 3 January 1767 at the age of 78. Works According to musicologist Anne Schnoebelen, Predieri's sacred music demonstrated his \\"mastery of vocal polyphony and polychoral writing\\" while the operas he composed in Vienna to texts by Metastasio and Giovanni Pasquini were marked by carefully set recitatives and arias with impressive dynamic colouring. The imperial court in Vienna made extensive use of trumpets for ceremonial occasions and employed 14 court trumpeters. In common with those of his predecessors at the court, Fux and Caldara, Predieri's Viennese operas and oratorios contained what Trevor Herbert has described as \\"spectacular high trumpet parts surpassing all others anywhere in terms of range and technical difficulty.\\"Herbert (1997) P. 91 An example of this can seen in the aria \\"Pace una volta\\" from his 1740 opera Zenobia. By the end of Predieri's lifetime, his operas were no longer performed, having been superseded by the reforms to the genre initiated by Jommelli and furthered by Gluck. Most of the scores for his operas and oratorios have been lost or survive only in fragments. Today, his most well-known composition is the Stabat Mater he wrote in Vienna, but he also composed many other pieces of church music, both for choir and solo voice, as well as a number of secular cantatas and instrumental pieces which have extant scores. Some of his works have received modern editions, including his Violin Concerto in B minor, a Stabat Mater, and the aria \\"Pace una volta\\".Violin Concerto in B minor was published by Hug (Zurich 1964); Stabat Mater by Mannheim Editions (New York 2009); \\"Pace una volta\\" by W.G.

It is slightly over long.  Name  Linguistic Research into the old name of die Eck shows that it is related to the Upper German word Ache, which means \\"river\\" or \\"creek\\" and is derived from the Old High German aha. In the Middle Ages, the river was known as Leinbach. This name refers to the Leinbaum, that is, the Lime tree (Tilia √ó europaea L., not related to the Citrus aurantifolia, the tree that produces the lime (fruit)). In those days, both the Norway Maple (Acer platanoides) and the Large-leaved Linden (Tilia platyphyllos) were called Leinbaum in German. Both species were common on the banks of the Eckbach. One difference between the species is the shape of the leaves: maple leaves are five lobed, lime leaves are undivided. The coat of arms of the House of Leiningen shows a stylized tree with five-lobed leaves and five-pointed flowers clearly point to a maple. The House of Leiningen originated in the area around the upper Eckbach. It is entirely possible that they named their ancestral castle after the river. The family was later named after their castle and the area around the upper Eckbach is now called Leininger Land. In the early 19th century, the local name of the river was Eck, as it is today. The Kingdom of Bavaria acquired the Palatinate in 1816. When Bavarian cartographers mapped the area, they were unaware of the meaning of the word Eck and wanted to make it clear that the \\"Eck\\" is a brook, so they recorded the name as Eckbach. Linguistically speaking, this name means \\"brook brook\\".  Course  The Eckbach rises near Carlsberg in northern Palatinate forest. The spring is framed in sandstone and is southeast of A6 (Saarbr√ºcken- Mannheim) at an elevation of above sea level in the Kleinfrankreich (\\"Little France\\") section of the Hertlingshausen district of Carlsberg. The spring is marked by a so-called Ritterstein. Eckbach in Kirchheim an der Weinstra√üe The area surrounding the upper Eckbach is known as the Leininger Land or Leiningerland, after the aristocratic Leiningen family who ruled the area in the High Middle Ages. The Eckbach is the central watercourse in this area. This part of the river is managed by the , a division of the county of Bad D√ºrkheim. The river initially flows in an easterly direction through Hertlingshausen, then northeast through Altleiningen, where it receives water from the artificial 20-Pipe Well (20-R√∂hren-Brunnen). In the northeastern outskirts of Altleiningen, the Eckbach takes up the long Rothbach from the left, then the long H√∂ninger Bach from the right. After flowing through the Eckbachweiher reservoir at Neuleiningen-Tal, the Eckbach breaks through the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest, the Haardt, between the village of Battenberg on the south bank and Neuleiningen on the north bank. It reaches the vineyard-covered hills around the German Wine Route at Kleinkarlbach. In Kirchheim an der Weinstrasse, the Eckbach, now flowing eastward, passes under the north-south running B271 highway, before flowing through Bissersheim. From there, the Eckbach flows in a northeasterly direction to Gro√ükarlbach, where it crosses the A6 motorway before flowing through Laumersheim. Eckbach in Dirmstein In Dirmstein, the Eckbach collects the long Flo√übach, locally known as the Landgraben, which is the Eckbach's largest tributary. To the left, that is, to the north of the Eckbach, the structure of the hills is clearly defined. There is a long, low ridge with three summits marking the divide between the Eisbach and the Eckbach: the W√∂rschberg, elevation , north of the road connecting Obers√ºlzen and Dirmstein, the Schneckenberg, elevation , between Dirmstein and Offstein and the Stahlberg, elevation , between Dirmstein and the Heppenheim district of Worms. The area south and to the right or the Eckbach is flatter and the Gro√ükarlbach-Laumersheim-Dirmstein- Gerolsheim area used to be a boggy lowland, which was used as pasture land. Further south lies the divide between the Eckbach and its southern neighbour, the Fuchsbach. This was a left tributary of the Isenach until the second half of the 20th century, when most of its water was diverted into Schrakelbach. The area between Laumersheim, Dirmstein, Gerolsheim and Heuchelheim contains a number of irrigation canals: Weihergraben, Altbach, K√ºhweidegraben, Altgraben, Bittinggraben and Lerchengraben. These ditches begin as distributaries of the Eckbach and return to the Eckbach downstream, some of them directly into Eckbach, some flow into Schrakelbach. East of Heuchelheim and to the north of the Frankenthal Interchange, the A61 crosses the Eckbach. The Eckbach then flows past Beindersheim. Just north of Beindersheim, it accepts from the right the Schrakelbach, which contains water from the Fuchsbach and from some of the irrigation canals mentioned earlier. The Eckbach the flows through the western part of the Upper Rhine Plain, flowing north-northeast past the villages Gro√üniedesheim and Kleinniedesheim. It continues northeast through Bobenheim, which is the northern part of Bobenheim-Roxheim. The next section is called Neugraben (\\"New Ditch\\") and flows due north. Southeast of Worms Airport, the Eckbach swings east. The river then flows into the Wormser Ried nature reserve. It crosses the municipal border into Worms, where it is known as Leininger Graben. The last bridge across the Eckbach carries the B9. It flows past the recreational area B√ºrgerweide on the southern side, then into the Upper Rhine at an elevation of .  History  Leiningen family coat of arms depicting a stylised tree that represents a lime Large-leaved lime: undivided lamina; five-petalled flower The old name of the river, the Eck is thought by linguistic experts to be derived from the word Ache, commonly used in the Upper German dialects of South Germany to mean \\"river\\" or \\"stream\\", which in turn came from the Old High German word aha. In the Middle Ages the Eckbach bore the name Leinbach, which is where its association with the lime tree arose. Leinbaum is the local word for both the large-leaved lime and the Norway maple; two species of tree that used to be very common on the banks of the Eckbach. They differ, however, especially in terms of the leaf shape: maple leaves have five lobes; lime leaves are undivided. The Leiningen family coat of arms of displays a stylised tree, whose leaves - and its five-petalled flowers ‚Äì are clearly those of a lime. The noble family of Leiningen who came from the region of the upper Eckbach were permitted to name their family castle after the old name for the stream; from which in turn the subsequent name of the family was derived. The fact that the stream, originally called the Eck, now bears the name Eckbach goes back to the Kingdom of Bavaria, which was granted that part of the Palatinate west of the Rhine in 1816. When Bavarian officials surveyed the Palatine cartographically they changed the name, in ignorance of the name's origin, in order to make clear that the Eck was a river (otherwise the word Eck or Ecke in German means \\"corner\\"). The result is that the present name of Eckbach linguistically means \\"stream stream\\".  Nature  Increasing abandonment of agricultural land in the area around the Eckbach and measures land restoration measures have enabled the return or colonisation of rare plant and animal species. In the early winter of 2012 great egrets were seen on the Eckbach near Dirmstein, a bird whose native habitat is actually further south and east.  Sights  ;Castles On the heights of the Palatine Forest and Haardt mountains above the Eckbach valley lies the castles of Altleiningen, Neuleiningen and Battenberg. Since 1980, stage productions by the Altleiningen Castle Players (Burgspiele Altleiningen) have taken place during the summer months. ;Blitzr√∂hren The so- called Blitzr√∂hren (\\"lightning pipes\\") on one of the roads leading to Battenberg are a natural monument. People used to think they were caused by lightning strikes, but they are now thought to be a result of geochemical action. ;Leiningen Valley Railway A section of the Leiningen Valley Railway used to run along the Eckbach for about between Kleinkarlbach and Altleiningen carrying both passengers and goods. ;Eckbach Mill Path In 1997 the Eckbach Mill Path was established alongside the Eckbach. Initially it only ran through seven villages that were part of the Gr√ºnstadt-Land collective municipality. Subsequently it has been extended as far as the source of the Eckbach near Hertlingshausen (Hettenleidelheim) giving it a total length of .

The well is fed by water from an adit that was driven deep into the rock around 1600 in order to supply the castle above. The actual source of the Eckbach is upstream, but this no longer delivers water all year round due to the lowering of the groundwater level. ;Eckbachweiher The Eckbach is impounded in the area of Neuleiningen-Tal to form the Eckbachweiher. In the past the section from here to Dirmstein had 35 water mills, of which 23 have more or less survived; and some of which have been restored.

Other mills worth visiting are the Felsenm√ºhle, operated as a hotel-restaurant in Neuleiningen-Tal and the Sporm√ºhle in Dirmstein, today a country hotel with an art gallery. The old Niederm√ºhle mill in Dirmstein was converted in the 19th century into a manor farm. ;St Lawrence's Church, Dirmstein St Lawrence's Church in Dirmstein is a small jewel of baroque architecture that was built from 1742 to 1746 to plans by church architect, Balthasar Neumann, and local builder, Franz Rothermel. The Eckbach, which used to flow just south of the church, was re-routed in the 1920s to the southern edge of the village. ;Salian Cycleway Since 2007 the Salian Cycleway, which links buildings and structures of the Salian dynastic period, has crossed the Eckbach Mill Path in Dirmstein.

Cobia: a new species for aquaculture in the US. World Aquaculture, 35: 12‚Äì14 Cobia are large pelagic fish, up to 2 metres (78 inches) long and 68 kilograms (150 pounds) in weight. They are solitary fish except when spawning, found in warm-temperate to tropical waters. Their rapid growth rate in aquaculture, as well as the high quality of their flesh, makes cobia potentially one of the more important potential marine fish for aquaculture production.Nhu, V.

In Taiwan cobia weighing 100‚Äì600 grams are cultured for 1‚Äì1.5 years to reach the 6‚Äì8 kilograms needed for export to Japan. Currently, around 80% of marine cages in Taiwan are devoted to cobia culture.Liao, I.C., Huang, T.S., Tsai, W.S., Hsueh, C.M., Chang, S.L. & Leano, E.M. (2004) \\"Cobia culture in Taiwan: current status and problems\\" Aquaculture, 237: 155‚Äì65. In 2004, the FAO reported that 80.6% of the world's cobia production was by China and Taiwan.Rachycentron canadum FAO Cultured Aquatic Species Information, Rome. Updated 23 May 2007. After China and Taiwan, Vietnam is the third largest producer of farmed cobia in the world where production was estimated at 1500 tonnes in 2008. The possibility is also being examined of growing hatchery reared cobia in offshore cages around Puerto Rico and the Bahamas. Greater depths, stronger currents, and distance from shore all act to reduce the environmental impacts often associated with fin fish aquaculture. Offshore cage systems could become some of the most environmentally sustainable methods for commercial marine fish aquaculture.Benetti, D.D., Alarcon, J.F., Stevens, O.M., O'Hanlon, B., Rivera, J.A., Banner-Stevens, G. and Rotman, F.J. (2003) Advances in hatchery and growout technology of marine finfish candidate species for offshore aquaculture in the Caribbean Proceedings of the Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute, 54: 475‚Äì487 However, some problems still exist in cobia culture that needs to be addressed and solved for increasing production. These include high mortality rates due to stress during transport from nursery tanks or inshore cages out to grow-out cages. Also, diseases in the nursery stage and the grow-out culture can result in low survival rates and a poor harvest. Production Cobia fingerlings in aquaculture Wild cobia broodstock are captured by professional fishermen. The fish are transferred into onboard-tanks on a transport vessel for transport to hatchery facilities. They are anesthetized with clove oil if necessary to reduce stress during transportation. They are also treated for ectoparasites on their gills and skin that could proliferate later after transfer to maturation tanks.Benetti, D. D., Orhun, M. R., Zink, I., Cavalin, F. G., Sardenberg, B., Palmer, K., Dnlinger, B., Bacoat, D. & O‚ÄôHanlon, B.

These tanks are often stocked with cleaner fish, Gobiosoma oceanops, as a biological control for any remaining ectoparasites. The broodstock diet includes sardines, squid and formulated feeds, as well as vitamin and mineral supplements. The water temperature is used to control spawning. The eggs are collected with a surface skimmer using mesh screen bags. The eggs are transferred to incubation tanks where they are disinfected for an hour with 100 ppm formalin. Phytoplankton concentrations are maintained, and enriched Artemia nauplii and rotifers are fed to the cobia larvae for 3‚Äì7 days after they hatch. The larvae require rotifers for at least four days after hatching. The presence of enriched live prey in conjunction with live algae in rearing tanks has been shown to improve the way larvae grow and survive in recirculating systemsFaulk, C.K. & Holt, G.J. (2005) Advances in rearing cobia Rachycentron canadum larvae in recirculating aquaculture systems: live prey enrichment and greenwater culture Aquaculture, 249: 231‚Äì243 Optimal rearing densities are required when rearing larvae. Even though water quality and food can be controlled, it has been shown that high rearing densities may still affect growth and survival of the larvae through responses related to crowding. In addition, juveniles exposed to varying salinities exhibited sustained growth and improved health at higher salinities, 15 and 30 ppt. Cobia larvae metamorphose to gill respiration 11‚Äì15 days post hatching. At 15‚Äì25 days post hatching, cobia are weaned onto commercial formulated feeds. Rearing cobia larvae at salinities as low as 15 ppt is possible.Faulk, C.K. & Holt, G.J.

Later cobia juveniles can be raised in ponds or shallow, near-shore submerged cages. Juveniles thrive on a wide range of protein and lipid, but there are optimal levels where they get the most benefit. After an 8-week growth trial, juvenile cobia displayed a peak in their weight gain with a dietary protein concentration of 44.5%.Chou, R.L., Su, M.S. & Chen, H.Y. (2001) \\"Optimal dietary protein and lipid levels for juvenile cobia (Rachycentron canadum). Aquaculture\\" 193: 81‚Äì89 Weight gain is also likely to increase as the lipid content in the diet increases. However, levels exceeding 15‚Äì18% produces little practical benefit because of higher fat accretion in the cobia.Wang, J.T., Liu, Y.J., Tian, L.X., Mai, K.S., Du, Z.Y., Wang, Y. & Yang, H.J. (2005) \\"Effect of dietary lipid level on growth performance, lipid deposition, hepatic lipogenesis in juvenile cobia (Rachycentron canadum)\\" Aquaculture, 249: 439‚Äì447 In addition, up to 40% of fish meal protein can be substituted with soybean meal protein before a reduction occurs in growth rates and protein utilization.Chou, R.L., Her, B.Y., Su, M.S., Hwang, G., Wu, Y.H. & Chen, H.Y.

The growth rate and survival rate of cobia during grow-out stages in open water cages throughout the Caribbean and Americas vary from as little as 10% up to 90%. Low survival rates are mainly due to disease, but also to shark attacks which tear holes in the nets of cages in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico and allow caged cobia to escape. However, better growth rates were experienced in offshore cage farms in Taiwan. In addition, cobia are considered to be gonochoristic, with differential growth rates occurring between sexes. Females grow faster and have been shown to be significantly longer and heavier within year classes.Franks, J.S., Warren, J.R. & Buchanan, M.V. (1999) \\"Age and growth of cobia, Rachycentron canadum, from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico\\" Fishery Bulletin 97: 459‚Äì471 Diseases * Nephrocalcinosis (kidney stones) cause significant mortality during both the hatchery and grow-out stages. These stones vary in diameter from 2‚Äì6 mm in the kidney and can block the urethra. This condition is not fully understood, but is thought to be a symptom of prolonged exposure to free carbon dioxide in excess of 10 mg/L. The ratio of calcium to magnesium in the diet could also be out of balance. * A Sphaerospora-like myxosporean infection caused 90% mortality during one month in a marine cage cultured in Taiwan. Benefits and constraints Offshore aquaculture, regardless of the species, is beneficial because it can avoid conflict with recreational activities and local fisherman, as well as potentially improving the coastal aesthetics.Naylor, R. & Burke, M. (2005) \\"Aquaculture and ocean resources: raising tigers of the sea\\" Annu. Rev. Environ. Resour. 30: 185‚Äì218 Further, repositioning aquaculture facilities in less polluted open water environments can produce better products, and the high flushing rates experienced in the open ocean reduces the effect of effluents on benthic communities. However, such operations require more developed infrastructure than near-shore aquaculture systems, which makes them expensive. Offshore sites have access difficulties and much higher labour costs.

In this period it was settled that James would succeed Elizabeth, but the diplomatic result was kept secret. James's accession to the thrones of England and Ireland is known as the Union of the Crowns. The embassy of the Earl of Mar James Erskine, Earl of Mar, and Edward Bruce, Commendator of Kinloss, went to London as ambassadors in February 1601,Masson, David, ed., Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol.6 (1884), p. 204 & footnote. attempting to secure the throne of England for James VI. The Scottish ambassadors expected to negotiate with the Earl of Essex, but he was executed on 25 February 1601 before their arrival in London.Bruce, John, (1861), p.xxix. Their first set of instructions are known from a summary by Essex's servant Henry Cuffe, who was condemned to hang.Yorke, Philip, ed., Miscellaneous State Papers, vol.1 (1778) pp.372-376: Birch Thomas, ed., Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 2, A. Millar (1754) pp.512-514 James VI then gave his ambassadors new instructions that they should \\"walk surely between the precipices of the Queen and the people\\" and encouraged them to go forward in private negotiation and to secure the individual support of key towns and ports.Dalrymple, David, Lord Hailes, Secret Correspondence (Edinburgh, 1766), pp. 1-12, James to Mar, 8 April 1601. Although Mar and Bruce gained the confidence of Robert Cecil and an understanding on the succession was reached, their success being kept secret.Houlbrooke, Ralph Anthony, James VI and I: ideas, authority, and government (Ashgate, 2006), p.40. At a meeting at the Duchy of Lancaster House, on the Strand, Cecil requested James not to seek an English parliamentary recognition of his claim to the throne and that future correspondence with the Scottish ambassadors should be a secret from Elizabeth herself. Until the death of Elizabeth I, two exchanges of letters between England and Scotland were kept up: the usual communication and the \\"secret correspondence\\".Bruce, John (1861), p.xxxv. Prequel Elizabeth sent a miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard to Prince Henry at Stirling Castle Scottish diplomats including the resident James Hudson, a former court musician, the financier Thomas Foulis and ambassadors including William Keith of Delny were in touch with the Earl of Essex and his secretary Anthony Bacon.Miles Kerr-Peterson, 'Sir William Keith of Delny: Courtier, Ambassador and Agent of Noble Power', Innes Review 67:2 (2016), pp. 138-158 In July 1595 the Chancellor of Scotland, John Maitland of Thirlestane, wrote to the Earl of Essex to try to establish a correspondence, a future \\"diligent intercourse of intelligence\\" involving the Scottish diplomat Richard Cockburn of Clerkington and Essex's secretary Anthony Bacon.Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England (Manchester, 2014), p. 136. Essex replied that he wrote only with the Queen's knowledge and that they would be happy to receive letters from Maitland or Cockburn.HMC Mar & Kellie, vol. 2 (London, 1930), pp. 36-7. In 1596 Queen Elizabeth, via the Earl of Essex and Anthony Bacon, sent her miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard to Prince Henry, and this was received by his guardian, the Earl of Mar at Stirling, according to Bacon's letter to Edward Bruce.Elizabeth Goldring, Nicholas Hilliard: Life of an Artist (London, 2019), p. 216: Paul Hammer, The polarisation of Elizabethan politics: The political career of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (Cambridge, 1999), p. 171: Lambeth Palace Library MS 659 f.217. Letters The private letters to Scotland were written by Robert Cecil and Henry Howard. James's letters were written by Mar; Kinloss and perhaps Mar's kinsman, Thomas Erskine of Gogar.Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England (Manchester, 2014), p. 139: For Thomas Erskine, see Hailes (1766), p. 97, 102, 111, 137, 209. Some of the letters were sent to England as if they were meant for the Duke of Rohan in France and so arrived in England to be added to the \\"diplomatic bag\\". The 18th-century historian Thomas Birch suggested that a Scottish representative in London, James Hamilton, was involved in sending the letters to Scotland. Hamilton had kept a school in Dublin and later, James made him Viscount Clandeboye.Calendar State Papers Scotland, 13:1 (1969), pp. xvii, xxxvii: Birch, Thomas, Life of Prince Henry (London/Dublin, 1760), p. 232 James Hamilton was accredited by James VI to reside in London by his letters to Elizabeth and Robert Cecil on 4 August 1600. James said that Hamilton would be a \\"remaining agent\\" the equivalent of George Nicolson in Edinburgh.John Duncan Mackie, Calendar State Papers Scotland, 13:2 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 674-5. James VI of Scotland criticised Henry Howard's verbose writing style. The English diplomat Henry Wotton later gave an anecdote that Elizabeth had once noticed mail arriving from Scotland. She demanded to see it, and Cecil made to open the satchel (which Wotton called a 'budget') but told the Queen it was filthy and smelled bad, and she could have the letters after they were aired.Bruce, John (1861), p.xxxix, citing Henry Wotton, Reliquiae Wottonianae (London, 1672), p. 169. It remains unclear if Elizabeth was actually unaware of any detail of Cecil's negotiations, as the historian Geoffrey Elton assumed.Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England (Manchester, 2014), p. 139. Henry Wotton himself came to Scotland in September 1601 from Florence. Posing as an Italian, Octavio Baldi, he met James and remained in character for three months. James discussed Wotton's arrival with Edward Bruce, Sir George Home, and the Earl of Mar. The English resident George Nicholson was unaware that the \\"Italian\\" was Wotton.CSP. Scotland, 13:2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 876 no. 714. Wotton later wrote that his mission was from Ferdinando de' Medici to advise James of a poison plot against him and bring a gift of antidotes.Henry Wotton, Reliquiae Wottonianae (London, 1654), pp. 29-35. Some of the letters, as was quite usual in diplomatic correspondence, used numbers to refer to individuals, Robert Cecil was '10', James was '30', Howard '3' and Bruce '8.'See Bruce, John (1861), pp.15-32, for examples with these numbers. By June 1602, James wrote of how Cecil and his colleague \\"40\\" had \\"so easily settled me in the only right course for my good, (and) so happily preserved the Queen's mind from the poison of jealous prejudice.\\"Bruce, (1861), p. 15, modern spelling. A separate \\"public\\" correspondence between Elizabeth and James continued. The historian John Duncan Mackie thought that the tone of the public letters had become more cordial than in previous years.Mackie, vol.1 (1969), p.xvii. The irregular subsidy that Elizabeth paid to James (in cash or jewellery) was also increased. James criticised Howard's style. In May 1602 comparing, he wrote that \\"my own laconic style\\" compared with Howard's \\"ample Asiatic and endless volumes\\".Hailes (1766), p.116: Alexander Courtney, 'The Secret Correspondence of James VI, 1601-3', in Susan Doran and Paulina Kewes, Doubtful and dangerous: The question of the succession in late Elizabethan England (Manchester, 2014), p. 140. The 19th-century historian Patrick Fraser Tytler noted the excessive flattery used by Howard and the effort made to exclude others from the discussions. Although James noticed and challenged Howard's attempts to direct his actions with regard to other channels of communication, Tytler summed up their success: > \\"At all events, nothing could have been more secretly or adroitly managed > than the whole correspondence between Howard, Cecil, and the Scottish king. > No one had the least suspicion of the understanding that existed between the > trio\\".Tytler, P.F., History of Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1879), p. 307. John Duncan Mackie noted that those unaware of the letters included the English resident agent in Scotland George Nicholson; the Master of Grey, an intriguer who served the Duke of Lennox; and James's own secretary James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino. One man outside the circle came to know of the letters,l and wrote to the Bishop of Durham in March 1602 that James VI had kept up a correspondence with Robert Cecil for six months but still disliked him. The Bishop sent the letter to Cecil. By examining the handwriting of that report, Mackie thought the poet William Fowler was its author.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, 13:1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. xvii & fn.2 citing HMC Cecil, vol. 14, pp. 211-2. Frances Howard, Countess of Kildare, also tried to set up a correspondence with the Scottish court, and the Earl of Northampton tried to prevent her.David Dalrymple, Secret Correspondence with James VI (Edinburgh, 1766), pp. 19-23, 209-10.

There were 80,000 Chinese people living in Zambia according to a 2019 U.N. World Population study. History There was significant temporary migration of thousands of Chinese workers when from 1970 to 1975 to Zambia to build the TAZARA Railway, the largest aid project, a rail connection between the copper mines of Zambia to the seaport of Tanzania. An explosives factory at the site of a mine in Chambishi exploded in 2005, killing over 50. The incident and rapid increase in Chinese migration raised the level of discontent towards Chinese mining investors, turning the issue of Chinese investors and migration into a political issue during both the 2006 Zambian general election and the one in 2011. Business With the take off in trade relations in the 2000s, growing from $100m in 2000 to $2.8 billion in 2010, Chinese investors in Zambia include large enterprises in mining and infrastructure, but also small businesses owners in areas like retail and even agriculture. The remarkable sight of a family of Chinese chicken farmers that moved to Zambia was the subject of a profile in the BBC News program From Our Correspondent with the reporter observing: \\"It sounds extraordinary but these Chinese businessmen and women spotted an opportunity to make a bit of money raising chickens on small farms in Zambia. They upped sticks and travelled 11,000km (7,000 miles) from their homes to do just that.\\" =5,000 Mining jobs in 2018= Zambia is a leading exporter of copper and Chinese investment in the mining sector has been considerable. Chinese investment in mines has accompanied the migration of Chinese owners and managers. In 2018, a Chinese firm launched a $832 million copper mine, setting Zambia's mining sector on a recovery path with 5,000 new jobs, and deepening ties between the Chinese and Zambian people. Controversy =Rapid population growth= There were 19,845 Chinese people living in Zambia in September 2014 according to the Home Affairs ministry in data provided to respond to questions raised in parliament. In 2019, this number quadrupled to 80,000. This rapid growth has reignited internal debates about an alleged takeover of Zambia. =2006 Race riots= During the 2006 election, Michael Sata the opposition presidential candidate lost after campaigning on rhetoric that China exploited the country and turned it into a \\"dumping ground.\\" Following his loss, in his stronghold of Lusaka, rioting broke out against Chinese businesses. In the following election in 2011, he would again campaign against Chinese investors, lambasting them for \\"taking over\\" Zambia. =2010 Mine manager murder= Tensions have arisen between mine managers and local workers. In February 2010 a Chinese mine manager was murdered by a Zambian worker. =2020 Apartheid closures= Three days after indefinitely closing Lantian restaurant in Lusaka's Longacres area for discriminating against Zambians, Lusaka Mayor Miles Sampa closed Chinese- owned Angels Barbershop at Arcades Shopping Mall for discriminating against Blacks. The Barbershop was also found displaying their prices in Chinese contrary to the Food and Health Act. ‚ÄúWe had a tip off from a whistle blower who took his son to cut hair but was told K300 as price just to put him off. When he agreed to pay, they then changed their mind and said the Barbershop was actually closed and had to leave‚Äù, said the Mayor. Later, in a statement released to the media, Mr. Sampa said that he had reviewed events last week and over the weekend as regards his monitoring and conduct towards some business houses and accepted his error in judgment of physically going to the business premises instead of engaging relevant offices and institutions. =2020 Factory boss murders= The brutal murder of three Chinese factory bosses in Zambia, allegedly killed by disgruntled employees over the weekend, rekindled tensions over China's strong presence in the country. The local press reported the three victims, who were found dead in their burnt out factory, were killed by aggrieved employees of their textile business in Makeni, a suburb of the capital Lusaka.

In some places, the feast is observed on the first Sunday in September with the permission of the Congregation for Divine Worship. Catholics set up altars in honor of guardian angels as early as the 4th Century, and local celebrations of a feast in honor of guardian angels go back to the 11th Century. The feast is also observed by some Anglo-Catholics within the Anglican Communion and most churches of the Continuing Anglican movement. History Devotion to the angels is an ancient tradition which the Christian Church inherited from Judaism.Barberi, Pietro. \\"Guardian Angels a Reason for Gratitude\\", Zenit, October 2, 2012 It began to develop with the birth of the monastic tradition.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. \\"Feast of the Guardian Angels\\", Saint of the Day: Lives, Lessons and Feast, (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media The feast was first kept by the Franciscan order in 1500. This feast, like many others, was local before it was placed in the General Roman Calendar in 1607 by Pope Paul V. The papal decree establishing the feast was cosigned by Robert Bellarmine, which has led some scholars to speculate that the feast was created under the influence of the Society of Jesus. It was originally ranked as a double, and is believed that the new feast was intended to be a kind of supplement to the Feast of St. Michael, since the Church honoured on that day (29 September) the memory of all the angels as well as the memory of St. Michael. Clement X elevated it to the rank of an obligatory double, and, finally, Leo XIII raised the feast to the rank of a double major.Gilmartin, Thomas. \\"Feast of Guardian Angels.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 1 Jan. 2015 Since 1976, it has been ranked an obligatory memorial. On October 2, 1795, Pius VI granted a partial indulgence for making the Devotions to our Guardian Angels and Patron Saints, as well as a plenary indulgence on the actual feast day to those who make the devotion twice a day for an entire year. The Devotion reads: \\"O Angel of God, to whose holy care I am committed by the supernal clemency, enlighten, protect, defend, and govern me. Amen.\\" John XXIII wrote a Meditation for the Feast of the Guardian Angels, which reads, in part: \\"We must remember how admirable was the intention of divine Providence in entrusting to the angels the mission of watching over all mankind, and over individual human beings, lest they should fall victims to the grave dangers which they encounter.\\" Observance The Feast of the Guardian Angels was of seminal importance to Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, who considered himself to have been inspired by God to found Opus Dei on October 2, 1928. The significance of the day of his inspiration was evident to Escriv√°, who believed that it was a sign that the work of the order would be carried out under the protection of angels.

It was Shindo's last film before his death in 2012 at age 100. The film is set during and after the Second World War, and it deals with the effect on families of the death of soldiers. It is loosely based on director Shindo's wartime experiences. Plot Near the end of the Second World War, Sadazo Morikawa (Naomasa Musaka) is one of a group of 100 overaged conscripts for the Japanese navy assigned to cleaning duty. Once the cleaning duty has finished, the members are chosen by lottery for various duties. Sadazo is assigned to serve in the Philippines. He thinks he will not survive, and asks a comrade, Matsuyama (Etsushi Toyokawa) to return a postcard to his wife, Tomoko (Shinobu Otake), and tell her that he received it before he died. Earlier, Sadazo is conscripted, and he says goodbye to his parents Yukichi (Akira Emoto) and Chiyo (Mitsuko Baisho) and wife Tomoko. Later, a military official reports Sadazo's death. Sadazo's parents plead with Tomoko not to leave, and to marry their younger son Sanpei (Yasuhito Ochi). Tomoko agrees to marry Sanpei. Sanpei is conscripted. He considers running away but his parents tell him it is useless. Sanpei dies in the war. Later, during farm work, Yukichi dies from a heart condition. Chiyo gives Tomoko some money and then hangs herself. The war ends and Matsuyama returns to Japan. His wife has run away after an affair with his father, and is now working as a bar hostess in Osaka. They meet and argue, and she tells him she wishes he had died in the war. Matsuyama makes his way to Tomoko's house to deliver the postcard. He talks about Sadazo and tells her he plans to go to Brazil. He has 200,000 yen from the sale of his fishing boat, and he tries to give her half. She refuses. He has a fight with Kichigoro (Ren Osugi), another suitor of Tomoko. After Tomoko and Matsuyama quarrel, they agree to go to Brazil together. They burn Sadazo and Sanpei's ashes. Tomoko gets drunk and sets fire to the house. Matsuyama pulls her out of the burning house. They decide to stay in Japan and grow barley on the site of the old house.

Yakhtul is located about \\"two German leagues (10 miles) north of the city of Mocha.\\" It contains a number of white houses, the Yakhtul Mosque and a school. History During World War I, British patrol vessels shelled Dhubab fort in November 1914 and opened fire on Yakhtul on 8 December 1914, damaging 7 or 8 dhows moored there. Geography Yakhtul lies on the coast of the Red Sea, at the head of a small shoal inlet, 10 miles north of Mocha. Jirdan lies further to the north of Yakhtul, 'Abus to the southeast and Kudhaysah to the northeast. The 9 mile stretch between Yakhtul and Marsa Farjah has numerous sand and coral patches which give the sea a dark grey colour. The stretch between Yakhtul and Al Zahari contains coastal palm groves. Economy MEED describes Yakhtul as being tourist oriented. Fishing is a major source of income for the locals. As of 1996, despite many of the houses having their own wells, high water salinity meant that it could only be used for bathing and cleaning, and drinking water had to be imported. However, the local diet is said to meet the World Health Organization minimum requirements, with a plentiful supply of nutrients from fresh fish and other local commodities. A French medical team was reported to be operating in Yakhtul in the mid 1980s. Notable landmarks Yakhtul is described as consisting of \\"a few white houses, some huts, and a mosque.\\" The town contains Yakhtul Mosque, which was said to have been \\"built at the expense of the good people of the area at a cost of one million riyals.\\" The same man who built the mosque also established Yakhtul preparatory school in the town, at a cost of l50,000 riyals. The \\"first phases of construction work\\" were reported to have been completed in 1989. At the village is what is called \\"Dar al-milh\\" (the place of salt).

It is now a museum.  Etymology  The name Verhildersum comes from Verhildert, where Ver means 'woman' or 'noble woman' and Hilder(t) is a proper name. When this woman lived is unknown. The ending -um in Verhildersum stands for 'house'.  History  Borg Verhildersum by Theodorus Beckeringh (1781) The borg dates, as a heerd (a word for farm in Gronings), from the 14th century. It became a borg in the 17th century. In 1398 a certain Aylko Ferhildema is mentioned, the same person as Aylko Onsta from Sauwerd. The surname Ferhildema could indicate that he (had) lived in Verhildersum. It is unknown whether, after Aylko Onsta, other members of the Onsta family lived in Verhildersum, but it is considered highly probable that the Onsta's kept possession of the borg for some time. One clue to this is that the borg was destroyed in both 1400 and 1514 by the city-Groningers (inhabitants of the city Groningen), just like the Onstaborg. However, in between these two battles no mention of the borg is made in official records. In a document mention is made of the reconstruction of the borg after 1514 for the sum of 1200 gold pieces, excluding some exterior buildings. After the death of the inhabitant Aepke Onsta in 1564, Ecke Claessen is mentioned as the inhabitant of the borg in 1576. Complaints by him are made with regard to troubles caused by billeted soldiers with their two wives and a child, who reside at the borg due to the Eighty Years' War. During the war Eylco Onsta flees to East Frisia, but despite this keeps calling himself hoofdeling of Wetsinge, Sauwerd and Verhildersum. However in reality, in 1587, twenty years after the death of Aepke Onsta, it is arranged in the property settlement that not he alone, but he and his sister Hidde Onsta together become owner of the borg Verhildersum. Verhildersum was then a heerd (farm) of 150 yokes (about 75 hectares) on which stood 'the old borg'.  Estate  Around the borg lies the Verhildersum Estate of 32 hectares. In the borg gardens are a carriage house, a farmhouse, and a garden shed. = Farmhouse = The schathuis in 1974 The schathuis was built originally built in 1833 on the estate of Saaksumborg, a borg which is now demolished. The schathuis used to be a farmhouse and derives its name from the old Frysian word skat, which means cattle. Gebouw en bewoners, Menkemaborg. Retrieved on 24 January 2014. In 1972, the schathuis was moved to the Verhildersum Estate. From 1994 to 2012, the fine dining restaurant Schathoes Verhildersum of chef Dick Soek was housed in the building. Schathoes, Piloersemaborg. Retrieved on 24 January 2014. The restaurant had one Michelin star from 2004 to 2012. Since 2012, the grand cafe 't Schathuys is housed in the building. = Garden = The late-nineteenth- century garden shed is the former 'tramhouse' of the Emmaplein in Haren, Groningen. The borg garden is laid out according to the golden ratio with characteristics from the Renaissance and the Baroque. The garden is also home to a herb garden, more than ninety types of roses and fifty types of Clematis. The garden is surrounded by moates.

After the death of Rikyu, the book was lost with its author, Nanbo Sokei, a Zen priest and Rikyu's leading disciple. About one hundred years later, in 1686, Tachibana Jitsuzan, the chief vassal of the Kuroda clan purportedly happened to find the book while heading to Edo with his lord. Tachibana set about the task of transcribing the work into five volumes, adding two further volumes when more documents came to light. He then made a fair copy of the seven volumes, and the book was named Southern Record for the first time. The collection was highly regarded as a direct record of Rikyu‚Äôs teachings and exerted a great influence on the process of the concept building of wabi-cha.

It is celebrated in Venice as the Festa del Redentore. It is also celebrated by the Redemptorists and was celebrated in the City of Rome. The feast is found only in the special calendar of some dioceses and religious orders, and is celebrated with proper Mass and Office either on the third Sunday of July or on 23 October. In Venice this feast has been observed for more than three centuries with great solemnity. Moroni in his \\"Dizionario\\" gives some interesting data concerning the origin of this feast. In 1576 a plague broke out in Venice which in a few days carried off thousands of victims. To avert this scourge the Senate vowed to erect a splendid temple to the Redeemer of mankind, and to offer therein each year on the third Sunday of July public and solemn services of thanksgiving. Scarcely had the plague ceased when they began to fulfil their vow. The church was designed by the famous Andrea Palladio, and the corner-stone was laid by the Patriarch Trevisan on 3 May, 1577. The celebrated painters Paolo Veronese and Jacopo Tintoretto decorated the interior. The church was consecrated in 1592, and, at the urgent solicitations of Pope Gregory XIII, placed in charge of the Capuchin Fathers. By concession of Pope Benedict XIV, dated 8 March, 1749, the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer solemnizes this feast as a double of the first class with an octave on the third Sunday of July. The same congregation also keeps the feast as a greater double on 23 October and 25 February, and has, besides, the privilege of reciting once a month the votive office of the Most Holy Redeemer. In Rome also Pope Pius VIII introduced the feast and by a Decree of 8 May, 1830, the Sacred Congregation of Rites assigned it to 23 October. The characteristics of the Mass and Office are joy and gratitude for the ineffable graces and benefits of the Redemption. This appears especially from the Introit \\"Gaudens gaudebo\\", from the antiphons of Lauds \\"Cantate Domino\\", from the Epistle of the Mass, taken from St. Paul to the Ephesians, (chapter 1), \\"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings . . . in Christ\\". For this reason white is the colour of the vestments, and not red, as in the Mass of the Passion.

This building, an important work of architect Isadore M. Lewis, was constructed as the Tushiyah United Hebrew School and served as the headquarters of the United Hebrew Schools of Detroit. It later served as the Scott Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church, the first mainline African-American Methodist Episcopal church in Detroit. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. The building now houses the Kirby Center Lofts. Tushiyah United Hebrew School In the early 1920s, the number of people of Detroit increased dramatically, and with it, the city's Jewish population also grew. The new wave of Jewish arrivals, particularly those emigrating from Eastern Europe, spread north along what was then the Hastings Street corridor (the current location of I-75). Between 1919 and 1924, the new population built a series of Talmud Torah schools, which emphasized community-based education. The locations of these schools spread northward along Hastings Street, following the Jewish population. The Tushiyah United Hebrew School, built in 1922 on Kirby and St. Antoine, was one of these schools. Also known as the Kirby Center, it was constructed as the headquarters of the United Hebrew Schools. The building contained classrooms for 1500 students and an auditorium for 2000 people. It served not only as a school for children, but also hosted adult education classes and community group functions. The school was designed by Isadore M. Lewis, a Jewish architect who designed a wide array of commercial, industrial, and residential buildings, primarily for Jewish clients. Lewis was born in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1888, and in 1916 moved to Detroit to open his own architectural firm. He practiced in Detroit until at least 1960, and died in 1968. As the 1920s wound down, the Jewish population began shifting northward and westward away from the Tushiyah United Hebrew School, building homes and schools in the Dexter-Davidson neighborhood. New African-American residents began moving into the Hastings Street neighborhood as the earlier Jewish residents moved out. The shift in population, combined with the decline in popularity of the Talmud Torah schools, lead to the closure of the Tushiyah United Hebrew School in 1929. Scott Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church In 1929, after the closure of the school, the building was sold to the Scott Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church. The Scott Memorial ME church was founded in 1909; it was the first African-American Methodist Episcopal congregation in the city. The congregation started small, meeting in homes and storefronts and sharing a pastor with a congregation in Toledo, Ohio. In 1914, the church constructed its first building. The congregation continued to grow, and by 1924, Scott was planning on the construction of a second building. The church instead purchased the Tushiyah United Hebrew School in 1929, presumably because the cost, $92,500, was less than that for a new building. The congregation worked hard to retire the mortgage, and by 1943, the building was paid off. This freed funding for building improvements, and the congregation put in new pews and a new roof in 1943, and remodeled part of the first floor into a youth center in 1948. Scott Memorial was instrumental in the eventual unification of the white and African-American Methodist Episcopal churches. In 1957, Scott Memorial co- hosted an inter-racial leadership conference with the white Detroit Metropolitan Methodist Church, featuring an address by Thurgood Marshall, then an attorney for the NAACP. However, the Scott Memorial ME church continued to grow, with over 2000 members in the mid-1960s. In 1968, the congregation began once more to look for a larger building. In 1970, the predominantly white Grace United Methodist Church merged with another congregation and offered their building, located on West Boston, to Scott Memorial for $1.00. Scott Memorial accepted the offer, and moved from the Kirby building. In 1984, Scott Memorial sold the Kirby building to the Wild Life Field and Stream Club. In 1997, the building was sold again to the Most Worshipful Unity Grand Lodge of Michigan, Ancient and Accepted Masons. This organization owned the building as of 2011, but planned to sell it to a developer for conversion into apartments. The building was sold, and conversion into loft space was underway by 2015. Renovation was completed in 2016, and as of 2018, the building housed 3 two- bedroom, 21 one-bedroom and 2 studio apartments. Description left The Tushiyah United Hebrew School ‚Äì Scott Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church is a two-story commercial-style building with a concrete foundation, masonry walls, and steel framing. The building is clad with tan brick, and features decorative brickwork with cast stone trim, medallions, and reliefs. The original building was constructed in an L-shape, 102 feet by 134 feet. An arched roof, obscured by the parapet walls, covers the main section while the east-west section of the building has a flat roof. A single-story addition of concrete block and brick was built in 1950 across the rear, making a C-shape. The front facade, facing Kirby Street, has five bays. The center bay has four piers with limestone bands and an urn at the top. Each floor has a pair of one-over-one double-hung windows with transoms. The bay to the left of the center contains the entrance, with two aluminum and glass doors. Two one-over- one double-hung windows with transoms hang on the second floor, surmounted by a weathered plaque reading \\"Tushiyah United Hebrew Schools of Detroit.\\" The parapet wall has a brick relief in the center. The bay to the right of the center is identical to the entrance bay, but with two one-over-one double-hung windows with transoms on the first floor in place of the entrance doors. The two end bays have two pairs of one-over-one double-hung windows with transoms on each floor. A classical metal cornice once ran the width of the facade, but has been removed. The side facade facing St. Antoine also has five bays: a wide center bay with five pairs of one-over-one double-hung windows with transoms, two flanking bays with three pairs of one-over-one double-hung windows with transoms, and two end bays with two pairs of one-over-one double- hung windows with transoms. Brick piers with limestone banding separate the windows. The elevations that do not face the street are red brick with limestone sills, pierced by similar one-over-one double-hung windows. Inside the building, the main entrance has a white tile floor containing green tiles spelling, \\"Kirby Center\\" and green-and-yellow tile wainscoting. The interior hallways have terrazzo floors, plaster walls, and acoustic ceiling tile. Classrooms open onto the hall through wood-and-glass doors with transoms; many rooms retain the original wood floors, wood trim, and plaster walls. A dining hall on the first floor is not original. An auditorium and associated coat room, bar area, and restrooms are on the second floor.

It is the fourth highest hill in the borough of Neusalza-Spremberg in Saxony, after the Fuchsberg (422 m) and Hahneberg (410 m) and an unnamed peak about 600 metres north of the Sonneberg (403.2 m).  Location and name  The Sonneberg lies about 500 metres southwest of the village of the same name in a forested area near the Czech border that is also called the Grenzwald (\\"border forest\\"). The new settlers of the village of Spremberg probably called the hill the Sonnebereg or Berg der Sonne (\\"hill of the sun\\"), because the sun in this neck of the woods went down late in the day over the treetops in the west. Its alternative name of Buchberg is derived from Buche (\\"beech tree\\") because beeches are the dominant species in the forest to this day. Formerly the hill was also called the Wauersberg after its owner, Wauer, a Sonneberg farmer. On old maps it is already called the Sonneberg, after which the village that emerged in 1800 was named and which has since become the present-day town of Neusalza-Spremberg.  Geology and geography  The Sonneberg is one of the highest elevations in the aforementioned 15 hectare woodland. The densely forested hill has a flattened summit on which individual blocks of granodiorite lie. Its peak is formed of nepheline basalt and is thus a geological feature in the Neusalza-Spremberg region. An old quarry on the higher elevation to the north on the northeastern slopes clearly shows the columns of nephiline basalt that were formed as the lava solidified. These emerged millions of years ago in the geological formations of the Tertiary period and record that volcanic processes took place here. The deep quarry, which is filled with water, resembles a crater lake. The Sonneberg towers like a spur over the village of Sonneberg in the western valley hollo of the borough ‚Äì formerly Spremberger Niederdorf - which is crossed by the Dresden- Zittau railway line. In a western direction the forest of the Sonneberg transitions seamlessly into the woods that once belonged to the Czech village of Fugau that no longer exists. In pre-Reformation times this woodland was also called the Spremberg Forest (Spremberger Wald). On the loam soils of the Sonneberg foothills the ground is waterlogged in places. Several streams collect together here into the so-called Sonnebergwasser, also called the Teichfl√∂ssel, which feeds several fish ponds at Neuspremberg as well as the forest swimming pool of the town. A field track from the western side of Neusalza-Spremberg leads over a railway bridge and adjacent pastureland to the Sonneberg.  Sources  * Walter Heinich: Spremberg.

An ultimate goal of this approach is to develop scientific models that unify quantum mechanics (describing three of the four known fundamental interactions) with gravity, making SVT a candidate for the theory of quantum gravity and describing all known interactions in the Universe, at both microscopic and astronomic scales, as different manifestations of the same entity, superfluid vacuum. History The concept of a luminiferous aether as a medium sustaining electromagnetic waves was discarded after the advent of the special theory of relativity, as the presence of the concept alongside special relativity leads to several contradictions; in particular, aether having a definite velocity at each space-time point will exhibit a preferred direction. This conflicts with the relativistic requirement that all directions within a light cone are equivalent. However, as early as in 1951 P.A.M. Dirac published two papers where he pointed out that we should take into account quantum fluctuations in the flow of the aether. His arguments involve the application of the uncertainty principle to the velocity of aether at any space-time point, implying that the velocity will not be a well-defined quantity. In fact, it will be distributed over various possible values. At best, one could represent the aether by a wave function representing the perfect vacuum state for which all aether velocities are equally probable. Inspired by the Dirac ideas, K. P. Sinha, C. Sivaram and E. C. G. Sudarshan published in 1975 a series of papers that suggested a new model for the aether according to which it is a superfluid state of fermion and anti-fermion pairs, describable by a macroscopic wave function. They noted that particle-like small fluctuations of superfluid background obey the Lorentz symmetry, even if the superfluid itself is non-relativistic. Nevertheless, they decided to treat the superfluid as the relativistic matter - by putting it into the stress‚Äìenergy tensor of the Einstein field equations. This did not allow them to describe the relativistic gravity as a small fluctuation of the superfluid vacuum, as subsequent authors have noted . Since then, several theories have been proposed within the SVT framework. They differ in how the structure and properties of the background superfluid must look. In absence of observational data which would rule out some of them, these theories are being pursued independently. Relation to other concepts and theories =Lorentz and Galilean symmetries= According to the approach, the background superfluid is assumed to be essentially non-relativistic whereas the Lorentz symmetry is not an exact symmetry of Nature but rather the approximate description valid only for small fluctuations. An observer who resides inside such vacuum and is capable of creating or measuring the small fluctuations would observe them as relativistic objects - unless their energy and momentum are sufficiently high to make the Lorentz-breaking corrections detectable.G. E. Volovik, The Universe in a helium droplet, Int. Ser. Monogr. Phys. 117 (2003) 1-507. If the energies and momenta are below the excitation threshold then the superfluid background behaves like the ideal fluid, therefore, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley-type experiments would observe no drag force from such aether. Further, in the theory of relativity the Galilean symmetry (pertinent to our macroscopic non- relativistic world) arises as the approximate one - when particles' velocities are small compared to speed of light in vacuum. In SVT one does not need to go through Lorentz symmetry to obtain the Galilean one - the dispersion relations of most non-relativistic superfluids are known to obey the non-relativistic behavior at large momenta.N. N. Bogoliubov, Izv. Acad. Nauk USSR 11, 77 (1947).N.N. Bogoliubov, J. Phys. 11, 23 (1947)V. L. Ginzburg, L. D. Landau, Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 20, 1064 (1950). To summarize, the fluctuations of vacuum superfluid behave like relativistic objects at \\"small\\"The term \\"small\\" refers here to the linearized limit, in practice the values of these momenta may not be small at all. momenta (a.k.a. the \\"phononic limit\\") :E^2 \\\\propto \\\\vec p^2 and like non-relativistic ones :E \\\\propto \\\\vec p^2 at large momenta. The yet unknown nontrivial physics is believed to be located somewhere between these two regimes. =Relativistic quantum field theory= In the relativistic quantum field theory the physical vacuum is also assumed to be some sort of non-trivial medium to which one can associate certain energy. This is because the concept of absolutely empty space (or \\"mathematical vacuum\\") contradicts the postulates of quantum mechanics. According to QFT, even in absence of real particles the background is always filled by pairs of creating and annihilating virtual particles. However, a direct attempt to describe such medium leads to the so-called ultraviolet divergences. In some QFT models, such as quantum electrodynamics, these problems can be \\"solved\\" using the renormalization technique, namely, replacing the diverging physical values by their experimentally measured values. In other theories, such as the quantum general relativity, this trick does not work, and reliable perturbation theory cannot be constructed. According to SVT, this is because in the high-energy (\\"ultraviolet\\") regime the Lorentz symmetry starts failing so dependent theories cannot be regarded valid for all scales of energies and momenta. Correspondingly, while the Lorentz-symmetric quantum field models are obviously a good approximation below the vacuum-energy threshold, in its close vicinity the relativistic description becomes more and more \\"effective\\" and less and less natural since one will need to adjust the expressions for the covariant field-theoretical actions by hand. =Curved space-time= According to general relativity, gravitational interaction is described in terms of space-time curvature using the mathematical formalism of Riemannian geometry. This was supported by numerous experiments and observations in the regime of low energies. However, the attempts to quantize general relativity led to various severe problems, therefore, the microscopic structure of gravity is still ill-defined. There may be a fundamental reason for this‚Äîthe degrees of freedom of general relativity are based on what may be only approximate and effective. The question of whether general relativity is an effective theory has been raised for a long time.A. D. Sakharov, Sov. Phys. Dokl. 12, 1040 (1968). This paper was reprinted in Gen. Rel. Grav. 32, 365 (2000) and commented in: M. Visser, Mod. Phys. Lett. A 17, 977 (2002). According to SVT, the curved space-time arises as the small-amplitude collective excitation mode of the non-relativistic background condensate. The mathematical description of this is similar to fluid-gravity analogy which is being used also in the analog gravity models.M. Novello, M. Visser, G. Volovik, Artificial Black Holes, World Scientific, River Edge, USA, 2002, p391. Thus, relativistic gravity is essentially a long-wavelength theory of the collective modes whose amplitude is small compared to the background one. Outside this requirement the curved-space description of gravity in terms of the Riemannian geometry becomes incomplete or ill-defined. =Cosmological constant= The notion of the cosmological constant makes sense in a relativistic theory only, therefore, within the SVT framework this constant can refer at most to the energy of small fluctuations of the vacuum above a background value, but not to the energy of the vacuum itself. Thus, in SVT this constant does not have any fundamental physical meaning, and related problems such as the vacuum catastrophe, simply do not occur in the first place. =Gravitational waves and gravitons= According to general relativity, the conventional gravitational wave is: # the small fluctuation of curved spacetime which # has been separated from its source and propagates independently. Superfluid vacuum theory brings into question the possibility that a relativistic object possessing both of these properties exists in nature. Indeed, according to the approach, the curved spacetime itself is the small collective excitation of the superfluid background, therefore, the property (1) means that the graviton would be in fact the \\"small fluctuation of the small fluctuation\\", which does not look like a physically robust concept (as if somebody tried to introduce small fluctuations inside a phonon, for instance). As a result, it may be not just a coincidence that in general relativity the gravitational field alone has no well-defined stress‚Äìenergy tensor, only the pseudotensor one.L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz, The Classical Theory of Fields, (1951), Pergamon Press, chapter 11.96. Therefore, the property (2) cannot be completely justified in a theory with exact Lorentz symmetry which the general relativity is. Though, SVT does not a priori forbid an existence of the non-localized wave-like excitations of the superfluid background which might be responsible for the astrophysical phenomena which are currently being attributed to gravitational waves, such as the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor binary. However, such excitations cannot be correctly described within the framework of a fully relativistic theory. =Mass generation and Higgs boson= The Higgs boson is the spin-0 particle that has been introduced in electroweak theory to give mass to the weak bosons. The origin of mass of the Higgs boson itself is not explained by electroweak theory. Instead, this mass is introduced as a free parameter by means of the Higgs potential, which thus makes it yet another free parameter of the Standard Model. Within the framework of the Standard Model (or its extensions) the theoretical estimates of this parameter's value are possible only indirectly and results differ from each other significantly. Thus, the usage of the Higgs boson (or any other elementary particle with predefined mass) alone is not the most fundamental solution of the mass generation problem but only its reformulation ad infinitum. Another known issue of the Glashow‚ÄìWeinberg‚ÄìSalam model is the wrong sign of mass term in the (unbroken) Higgs sector for energies above the symmetry-breaking scale.If one expands the Higgs potential then the coefficient at the quadratic term appears to be negative. This coefficient has a physical meaning of squared mass of a scalar particle. While SVT does not explicitly forbid the existence of the electroweak Higgs particle, it has its own idea of the fundamental mass generation mechanism - elementary particles acquire mass due to the interaction with the vacuum condensate, similarly to the gap generation mechanism in superconductors or superfluids. Although this idea is not entirely new, one could recall the relativistic Coleman-Weinberg approach, SVT gives the meaning to the symmetry-breaking relativistic scalar field as describing small fluctuations of background superfluid which can be interpreted as an elementary particle only under certain conditions. In general, one allows two scenarios to happen: * Higgs boson exists: in this case SVT provides the mass generation mechanism which underlies the electroweak one and explains the origin of mass of the Higgs boson itself; * Higgs boson does not exist: then the weak bosons acquire mass by directly interacting with the vacuum condensate. Thus, the Higgs boson, even if it exists, would be a by-product of the fundamental mass generation phenomenon rather than its cause. Also, some versions of SVT favor a wave equation based on the logarithmic potential rather than on the quartic one. The former potential has not only the Mexican-hat shape, necessary for the spontaneous symmetry breaking, but also some other features which make it more suitable for the vacuum's description. Logarithmic BEC vacuum theory In this model the physical vacuum is conjectured to be strongly-correlated quantum Bose liquid whose ground-state wavefunction is described by the logarithmic Schr√∂dinger equation. It was shown that the relativistic gravitational interaction arises as the small-amplitude collective excitation mode whereas relativistic elementary particles can be described by the particle-like modes in the limit of low energies and momenta. The essential difference of this theory from others is that in the logarithmic superfluid the maximal velocity of fluctuations is constant in the leading (classical) order. This allows to fully recover the relativity postulates in the \\"phononic\\" (linearized) limit. The proposed theory has many observational consequences. They are based on the fact that at high energies and momenta the behavior of the particle-like modes eventually becomes distinct from the relativistic one - they can reach the speed of light limit at finite energy. Among other predicted effects is the superluminal propagation and vacuum Cherenkov radiation. Theory advocates the mass generation mechanism which is supposed to replace or alter the electroweak Higgs one. It was shown that masses of elementary particles can arise as a result of interaction with the superfluid vacuum, similarly to the gap generation mechanism in superconductors. For instance, the photon propagating in the average interstellar vacuum acquires a tiny mass which is estimated to be about 10‚àí35 electronvolt. One can also derive an effective potential for the Higgs sector which is different from the one used in the Glashow‚ÄìWeinberg‚ÄìSalam model, yet it yields the mass generation and it is free of the imaginary-mass problem appearing in the conventional Higgs potential.

His father dies shortly after . Raghav decides to become a journalist and pursue a career in a newspaper publishing house. Meanwhile, Gopal is contacted by a politician who wishes to build an engineering college on the highly valuable land that Gopal's family owns. Gopal agrees to the deal, and joins the system of corruption in India in order to build the college with the politician's black money. He is tired of giving white envelopes to officials but has no other choice. Raghav, now a journalist, exposes the corruption-funded college and is eventually fired from the newshouse. Raghav starts his own newspaper, Revolution 2020, to change the world and expose the corrupt system in India. After another expose, Raghav's newspaper is shut down by politicians and thugs, and he loses almost everything. Raghav is still passionate about his activism and forgets about Aarti. They are still unmarried. Aarti and Gopal reconnect and often meet after work in coffee shops and other places, unbeknownst to Raghav. Gopal books a hotel room in the same hotel that Aarti works. Gopal seduces Aarti who returns his love, giving in to years of suppressed feelings. Aarti falls in love with Gopal, and begins to cheat on Raghav .Gopal then decides to disclose to Raghav that him and Aarti are a couple. Gopal goes to Raghav's office but a chance encounter with a poor farmer and his kid who had come to Raghav for help shakes him up and he realizes the folly of money, power and wealth. He decides to let go of Aarti perhaps realising they were never meant to be together and Raghav would always remain Aarti's love. He with the help of politician invites two prostitutes as a part of his birthday surprise and ensures Aarti witnesses it, making her hate him forever. He anonymously helps Raghav get a job, and suggests he become a politician (MLA) to bring about the revolution he desired. Aarti and Raghav thereafter got married.

Having begun his career in the reserve teams of Valencia, Real Madrid and Villarreal, he later became a journeyman. Club career Jony was born in Elche, Valencian Community. With the exception of one Segunda Divisi√≥n game with Real Madrid Castilla, he played until the age of 26 in lower league football, representing mainly Real Madrid C and Ontinyent CF. In the summer of 2011, Jony returned to the second level with CD Guadalajara, playing 33 games (26 starts) as his new team went on to retain their newly acquired league status. He scored his first goal during the following season, but in a 1‚Äì5 home loss against Girona FC on 25 August 2012. On 2 August 2013, following Guadalajara's relegation due to financial irregularities, Jony stayed in division two by signing for two years with AD Alcorc√≥n. He made 25 competitive appearances over the campaign, being sent off in the penultimate fixture on 3 May 2014, a 1‚Äì0 win over Sporting de Gij√≥n at the Estadio Santo Domingo. Jony moved abroad for the first time on 4 July 2014, signing a two- year deal at Portuguese club Rio Ave FC. He was not included in their squad for that year's Superta√ßa C√¢ndido de Oliveira, nor did he feature at all in the UEFA Europa League, his input eventually consisting of three official matches; his sole Primeira Liga appearance came on 17 May 2015 in the penultimate game of the season, coming on as a substitute for Diego Lopes for the final two minutes of a 0‚Äì4 loss at C.S. Mar√≠timo. Jony then joined CD Feirense, making one Ta√ßa da Liga appearance and two unused substitute roles in the Segunda Liga before he and Ot√°vio Guariente had the contracts cancelled. He resumed his career on 10 February 2016 in Slovenia at FC Koper, and turned down an approach by CD Alcoyano in June. On 8 June 2016, Jony's contract with Koper was mutually terminated. Later that month, he made the move to Alcoyano, and scored a career-best 11 goals over the campaign to reach the playoffs; this included two in a 3‚Äì2 home defeat of FC Barcelona B on 11 September. Jony signed for RCD Mallorca in June 2017. Before playing a game, he rescinded his contract and moved to UCAM Murcia CF in the same league on 31 August. On 26 December, he left the latter side by the same manner, and joined Elche CF from his hometown the next day. Jony scored his first Elche goal on 6 May 2018 to open a 1‚Äì1 draw against provincial rivals H√©rcules CF in the penultimate round of a season that ended with promotion by the playoffs. After making just one substitute appearance in 2018‚Äì19 in the second tier, he was loaned back to Alcoyano in July 2019, this time in the Tercera Divisi√≥n; the move was extended for a further year on 8 September 2020. Personal life Jony comes from a football family: his father, Jos√© Antonio, played several years with Elche CF ‚Äì including the 1984‚Äì85 season in La Liga ‚Äì as a striker. His younger brother, Aar√≥n (another midfielder), was also brought up at Valencia, spending his entire senior career in the lower leagues. The youngest, Sa√∫l, was brought up at Atl√©tico Madrid.

Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.Syme, pg. 333 Murena, disbelieving Augustus's testimony and resentful of his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas, rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.Syme, pg. 333; Holland, pg. 300; Southern, pg, 108 Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony.Wells, pg. 53; Raaflaub, pg. 426 Then, sometime prior to September 1, 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio against the Princeps.Swan, pg. 241; Syme, pg. 483 Murena was named among the conspirators. Learning about charges from his sister Terentia, who in turn had been notified by her husband Maecenas, Murena apparently fled.Holland, pg. 301 A court was convened in his absence, with Tiberius acting as prosecutor. The jury found Murena, along with his fellow accused, guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict.Wells, pg. 53; Holland, pg. 301 Sentenced to death for treason, Murena was executed as soon as he was captured without ever being given the opportunity to give testimony in his defence.Davies, pg. 260; Holland, pg. 301  Sources  = Ancient = * Dio Cassius Roman History (c. 130 AD) * Strabo Geographica (c. 10 AD) = Modern = * Ando, Clifford, Imperial ideology and provincial loyalty in the Roman Empire, University of California Press, 2000 * Davies, Mark; Swain, Hilary; Davies, Mark Everson, Aspects of Roman history, 82 BC-AD 14: a source-based approach, Taylor & Francis e-Library, 2010 * Holland, Richard, Augustus, Godfather of Europe, Sutton Publishing, 2005 * Raaflaub, Kurt A.; Toher, Mark, Between republic and empire: interpretations of Augustus and his principate, University of California Press, 1993 * Smith's Dictionary of Roman Biography and Mythology (1873) *Southern, Pat, Augustus, Routledge, 1998 * Swan, Michael, The Consular Fasti of 23 B.C. and the Conspiracy of Varro Murena, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Volume 71, pgs. 235 ‚Äì 247, Harvard University Press, 1967 * Syme, Ronald, The Roman Revolution, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1939 * Wells, Colin Michael, The Roman Empire, Harvard University Press, 2004 * Woodman, A.

The Hounds of Spring are on Winter's Traces!\\"Elijah Wald, The Boston Sunday Globe, April 23, 1994, \\"With help from JP students, puppets will usher in spring\\" It is an extremely loose affiliation - there is no membership as such, so that people are sometimes surprised to find themselves belonging to the group without having joined it. History The Puppeteers Cooperative was formed in San Francisco in 1976 by George Konnoff and Sara Peattie, two puppeteers formerly with the Bread and Puppet Theater. It was incorporated as a non-profit in Massachusetts in 1994. In 1993, Teresa Linnihan, then the director of the Newburyport Children's Theater at Maudslay State Park, joined in about 1997. George Konnoff died in 2001. The Puppeteers Cooperative is known for its community outreach and education. The Cooperative has giant puppet pageants, community workshopshttp://www.gis.net/~puppetco/playmaking.htm that stress community involvement, and Free Puppet Lending Libraries that make giant puppets available to the general public. It publishes an educational booklet called \\"68 Ways to Make Really Big Puppets: A Patternbook of Parades and Pagents,\\" web pages, and videos, all of which share ways of making giant puppets and spectacles from simple techniques and everyday materials. As well as the Lending Libraries, the group includes The Back Alley Puppet Theater, which does pageants, parades, and puppet dances in the Boston area; The Construction Section, giant puppet makers; Hi-Art Productions, video makers; and Puppaganda, which performs short and small news shows. Continuing events * 1976 ‚Äì present: the Back Alley Puppet Theater and later the Puppeteers Cooperative have participated in the First Night Boston Grand Processions.

These were often based loosely on Shakespeare plays. * 1994 ‚Äì present: The group organized, produced, and performed \\"The Rights (or Rites) of Spring,\\" a free outdoor giant puppet pageant, in various states and venues.

After a playing career which included spells in the Football League with Watford and Bradford City, he was appointed the first ever manager of the England women's national team in 1972. He later coached the men's national teams of Australia and Papua New Guinea. He is a member of Australia's Football Hall of Fame. Playing career After two years at Queens Park Rangers without appearing in the first team, Worthington made his Football League debut with Watford after joining in August 1949. He combined his duties as a schoolmaster and professional footballer, making 30 appearances for the Hornets over two seasons before dropping into non‚Äìleague with Dover.Trefor Jones (1996). The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who, p. 249; . A prolific spell with Dover saw a brief return to the league ranks with Bradford City in September 1953, before, weeks later, he was back in Kent with Margate while doing a teacher training course. Worthington remained with Margate eight years, overcoming injuries to make 243 appearances in both attack and midfield, scoring 36 goals and captaining the team on occasion. He retired in 1961 to take up a position at Loughborough College. Coaching career Worthington was the original manager of the England women's national football team, taking charge for their first official match against Scotland in 1972. The following year he was appointed director of coaching by Australian Soccer Federation and was tasked with overhauling the entire structure of football coaching in Australia. He was later hailed as an \\"outstanding servant\\" and \\"pioneer\\", though his administration's apparent preference for British coaches led to allegations of \\"jobs for the boys\\" and a \\"pommie mafia\\". In 1975 Worthington took charge of the Australia national soccer team for four friendlies at B level. Worthington coached the Papua New Guinea national team during their Olympic qualifiers in 1976. He retired as director of coaching in 1989 and his last official role was taking an Australian student select team to his home city of Sheffield for the 1991 Summer Universiade. He was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1999.

Cash Ltd., is a company in Coventry, England, founded in 1846, that manufactures woven name tapes and other woven products and is known for formerly making ribbons.  Foundation  The company was founded by two brothers, John and Joseph Cash, sons of a wealthy stuff (or textile)-merchant, also called Joseph. At the time of the company's founding, the father and sons already had a warehouse and offices in Hertford Street, Coventry. They sold ribbons made for them by outworkers. In 1846, the two brothers set up a ribbon-making factory with 100 looms, at West Orchard.  Cash Family  Joseph Cash in 1900 The brothers, who were Quakers, were philanthropists and model employers; Joseph for example founded the Coventry Labourers' and Artisans' Friendly Society, in 1843, along with his friend Charles Bray. This friendly society provided 400 allotments for working people, as well as a store selling groceries. He built an infants' school in the garden of his home, Sherborne House, in 1853, which he also allowed local Wesleyans to use as a place of worship. John Cash bought his house, 'Rosehill', from Charles Bray. George Eliot had been staying with the Bray family, and on sale of the property she moved into the smaller Ivy Cottage on the grounds. John's wife was Mary Sibree, to whom Eliot had been tutor of German.  Cash's Topshops  The cottages at Kingfield, on Cash's Lane Second block of cottages, facing the Coventry Canal In 1857, Cash's commissioned a series of three-storey weavers' cottages on a plot of land alongside the Coventry Canal at Kingfield, and on a road now known as Cash's Lane (), then in countryside, outside the city boundary. Initially 100 such cottages were planned, but eventually only 48 were built, in two blocks. These used bricks, with tiled roofs and mock Tudor barge-boards on the gables. Each had a garden. On the top floor of each cottage was a well-lit work area topshop, known collectively as 'Cash's Topshops', housing a Jacquard loom, powered by a central, steam-powered beam engine. They opened for business on 12 October 1857, and the individual workshops were combined into single, large, workspaces in 1862. The houses still stand, and were Grade II listed on 10 October 1975. A park called Cash's Park lies nearby, to the west ().  William Andrews  The diary of Cash's first factory manager at Kingfield, William Andrews, was the subject of a book, Master and Artisan in Victorian England, published in 1969, in which it was reproduced. The original is held in the city's Herbert Art Gallery and Museum (\\"The Herbert\\"). Andrews (1835-1914) joined the firm in 1855, as a designer, immediately after completing his apprenticeship. The Cash brothers contracted him for three years, at annual salary of ¬£100. In late 1857 he was offered managership of the Kingfield site, and took up residence at 8, Kingfield. He negotiated a salary of ¬£120, with his house, gas and coal provided free. In addition, he was to be paid separately for his design work. He was not popular with the weavers, and left in June 1858 to manage another part of the business, at Drapers Fields.  Name Tapes  leftThe Cash brothers‚Äô willingness to take risks again manifested during the 1870s when the firm began producing coloured embroidery work. This in turn led to the production of embroidered name tapes for clothing, which became the core of the company‚Äôs business by the turn of the century. The success of J. & J. Cash, Ltd.‚Äôs name tape business soon led to the decision to establish a production facility in the United States.  J. & J. Cash Ltd. U.S. / Frank Goodchild  403x403pxA site was secured in South Norwalk, Connecticut in 1905 and work on the new factory was completed in October 1906. At the time of the building‚Äôs completion, executives at J. and J. Cash felt that the size of the new Norwalk plant would suffice for at least 20 years of growth, however, a substantial addition was needed by 1912. It was at this point in time that the manufacture of woven clothing labels was added to the firm‚Äôs catalog, a move that would drive the need for further additions to the factory during the 1920s.''''''

Frank Goodchild served the firm from 1886 to 1946 at Coventry and subsequently in the USA, finally as President of the US Company. Post war November 1940: factory yard after the raid. The factory was damaged by bombing in the Second World War, and parts subsequently demolished. Cash's had many difficulties rebuilding and trying to get back to prewar capacity. By 1952 the greater part of the work was done. Cash's Logo updated circa 1970 During the 1960s, Cash's absorbed other Coventry weaving companies, including B. Laird, Lester Harris and W.H. Grant. Other local competitors failed, leaving Cash's the only survivor of the type in the city. In January 1964, Cash's were appointed 'Manufacturers of Woven Name Tapes to Her Majesty the Queen.' The company was sold to the Jones Stroud Group in 1976, ending the involvement of the Cash family. In 1984, the Kingfield site was vacated, and the company moved to more modern premises on Torrington Avenue, where it continued to make woven products until January 2014 when the company went into administration. Though on 13 February 2014 it was announced that Hong Kong based The Jointak Group had invested in the company and that it would reopen under the name \\"Cash's Apparel Solutions\\". On 23 December 2014, Cash's moved out of Torrington Avenue to the Seven Stars Industrial Estate at Wheler Road in Coventry. Then moved to unit 13/14 Colliery Lane Exhall Coventry CV7 9NW address registered on 21 December 2019. Cash's no longer make ribbons, although they continue to weave the time-honoured identity nametapes, together with woven pictures, cards and bookmarks. In more recent years the main focus of the business has been a new anti-counterfeit and tamper evident security labelling department for high-end brands, called CertiEye.Tamper evident security labelling department Retrieved 16 June 2017. Becoming part of the global Jointak Group has secured the Cash's brand for future generations.  Legacy  Many Cash's products are sought after by collectors, and featured in museum collections. Cash's original records at Kingfield Road were destroyed by a bomb, but many of the company's subsequent archives are in the Coventry local history centre, in The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.

Popularly known as the Riyadh‚ÄìQassim Expressway, Highway 65 connects Howtat Bani Tamim to Qurayyat and further to the Al Hadithah border with Jordan, while providing connections to or passing through Riyadh, Majma'ah, al-Ghat, Zulfi, Buraidah, 'Unaizah, ar-Rass, Ha'il, Daumat al-Jandal, Sakakah and other smaller villages and towns. It also provides access to the Naisiyah Wildlife Reserve, Khanafah Wildlife Sanctuary, Tubaiq Natural Reserve, and the Harrat al-Harrah Conservation.Highway 65 forms a major part of Riyadh's road network and is known as the King Fahd Road, straddling the King Abdullah Financial District, the Kingdom Center, and Al Faisaliyah Center.The highway consists of three traffic lanes with a shoulder on each side separated by a median strip. All intersections on the highway are grade separated, largely cloverleaf interchanges with some other types of interchanges used for U-turns or desert access roads. The highway has no bridges and tunnels as it traverses the relatively flat Najd plateau and Nafud desert. The road is operated by the Saudi Ministry of Transport and is not tolled. In conjunction with the Kingdom's five-year plans, the Saudi Ministry of Transport prepared its own comprehensive plan, known as the Five-Year Road Programme. The first of these began in 1970 and the system is still implemented today. The Kharj‚ÄìQassim was the first portion of the highway to built and was modernized during the Third Development Plan (1980‚Äì85). The rest of the highway began construction much later, in the Seventh Development Plan (2000‚Äì05) and completed in the Eighth Development Plan (2005‚Äì10). The road was also commissioned much later than most Saudi highways. Route description The Riyadh‚ÄìQassim section of the highway is often referred to as the Riyadh‚ÄìQassim Expressway. Highway 65 () is a major controlled-access highway in Saudi Arabia, and runs in the north-south direction. Starting at Howtat Bani Tamim south of Riyadh, the highway runs in the southeast-northwest direction and ends at the Al Hadithah/Omari border with Jordan near Qurayyat. It spans 1,427 km (887 mi) and travels through the following provinces: the Riyadh Province, Qassim Province, Ha'il Province and the Al Jawf Province. Highway 65 is connected to the following cities: Kharj via Highway 10, Riyadh, Majma'ah, Buraidah, Unaizah, Sakakah via Highway 80 and Qurayyat. It is also part of the Arab Mashreq International Road Network and carries Route 35M Riyadh‚ÄìBuraidah‚ÄìHa'il‚ÄìSakakah‚ÄìAl Hadithah/Omari‚ÄìAzraq‚ÄìAmman through the central Arabian Peninsula. With minor exceptions, the highway consists of three traffic lanes, with one emergency lane on each side, separated by a median strip and fence. All intersections on the highway are grade-separated; predominantly cloverleaf interchanges. There are numerous rest areas along the highway, with some being limited to the most basic of amenities featuring a petrol station and cafe, with others including restaurants, hotels and fast- food outlets. Almost all have a masjid, with recent regulations declaring the travel time between rest areas be no longer than 60 minutes. The highway begins east of Howtat Bani Tamim, at the intersection of the Al Ha'ir‚ÄìHowtat Bani Tamim Road and Highway 10. It travels north passing Wadi Mawan, and intersects Road 5399 just south of Al Ha'ir. Continuing north, it reaches Riyadh and intersects the Southern Ring Road near the al-Masani' district. It turns west and is carried by the Southern Ring Road to Exit 23 (Algiers Square), where it turns north again and passes through the center of Riyadh as King Fahd Road. Here it intersects Highway 40 at one of the most important intersections in the Kingdom, Exit 4 (Rabat Square). It exits Riyadh near Banban and gently turns northwest, passing Sudair, Al Majma'ah and Al Ghat. After passing Al Ghat, Highway 65 turns west and intersects Highway 60, and these highways run concurrently to Buraidah, where Highway 65 turns back north while Highway 60 continues west toward Medina and Yanbu. Highway 65 continues north into the Ha'il Province, passing north of Ha'il and enters the Nafud desert. Continuing into the Al Jouf Province, it intersects Highway 80 near Sakakah and runs concurrently with it westward, splitting near Abu 'Ajram where Highway 80 continues west toward Tabuk while Highway 65 turns north toward Qurayyat, terminating at the Jordanian border at Al Hadithah/Omari, where it becomes Jordanian Highway 30.

It is morphologically similar to P. aurotaenia, but genetically it is more closely related to P. terribilis.Phyllobates sp. aff. aurotaenia  DendroBase.de It can be distinguished from P. aurotaenia by its uniform chocolate brown or navy blue body, and its orange or red, rather than green or yellow, stripes.  Toxicity  All Phyllobates species are highly toxic, and P. sp. aff. aurotaenia is no exception. Its skin contains batrachotoxins, extremely potent neurotoxic alkaloids. When in contact with the skin, batrachotoxins seep through open wounds and, in some cases, skin pores, and prevent nerves from transmitting impulses, leaving the muscles in an inactive state of contraction. This can lead to heart failure or fibrillation. Some native people use this poison to hunt by coating darts with the frogs' poison. Alkaloid batrachotoxins can be stored by frogs for years after the frog is deprived of the food-based source, and such toxins do not readily deteriorate, even when transferred to another surface. Chickens and dogs have died from contact with a paper towel on which the more toxic P. terribilis had walked.ADW: Phyllobates terribilis: InformationWonderQuest: Most poisonous animal, Contentious ethanol debate, Do fish sleep?

He was named European Champion Two-Year-Old at the 1995 Cartier Racing Awards. In his championship season he won all five of his races including the Group One Dewhurst Stakes and three other Group races. He went on to win the Prix du Rond Point at three and the International Stakes (Ireland) and Prix Dollar as a four-year-old. After his retirement he became a successful stallion and is currently standing at the Derrinstown Stud in Ireland. Background Alhaarth, a bay horse with a white blaze standing 16 hands high, was bred in Ireland by his owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud. He was sired by Unfuwain out of the mare Irish Valley. Unfuwain was a high-class middle-distance runner who won four Group races before siring the winners of more than five hundred winners at stud. Irish Valley, who never raced, was a half-sister to the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner and Champion sire Green Dancer and in addition to Alhaarth, produced the Prix du Calvados winner, Green Pola. Alhaarth was originally sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley. At the end of his three-year-old season, he was transferred to the Godolphin team and moved to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. He was ridden in ten of his first eleven races by Willie Carson, who retired at the end of the 1996 season: Alhaarth's Dewhurst victory was Carson's last Group One win in Britain. Alhaarth means \\"the tiller\\" in Arabic.https://translate.google.com/#autoen%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AB%20 Racing career =1995: two-year-old season= Alhaarth made his debut in a maiden race at Newmarket in July. He showed his inexperience (\\"ran green\\") but took the lead inside the final furlong to win by a neck from the future Classic winner Mark of Esteem. Two weeks later he was moved into Group Three class for the Vintage Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. Alhaarth started odds-on favourite and after tracking the leaders he recovered from being hampered in the straight to win by a length from Allied Forces. In the Solario Stakes at Sandown in August, Alhaarth started at 30/100 and won comfortably, beating Staffin by three lengths. The Independent's correspondent praised his balance, \\"authority\\" and \\"exceptional stride\\", whilst bookmakers offered him at 16/1 for the 2000 Guineas and 8/1 for the Derby. Only two colts took on Alhaarth in the Champagne Stakes. He won again, beating Rio Duvida at odds of 2/5, but the lack of pace and weak opposition meant that the race proved little. On his final start of the season, Alhaarth was sent to Newmarket for Britain's most prestigious two-year-old race, the Group One Dewhurst Stakes. Only three colts opposed Alhaarth, but they included the Prix Morny winner Tagula, and the unbeaten Danehill Dancer, winner of the Phoenix Stakes and the National Stakes. Alhaarth tracked the pacemaker Albaha, before moving into the lead three furlongs out. He soon went clear and recorded an \\"impressive\\" win, beating Danehill Dancer by two and a half lengths. Hern called the \\"demolition\\" of Danehill Dancer as a \\"great performance\\" and described Alhaarth as the best two-year-old he had trained while the senior handicapper Geoffrey Gibbs called the win \\"very authoritative\\" and suggested that Alhaarth was on the way to becoming a great horse. His price for the Guineas was as cut to as low as 2/1. =1996: three-year-old season= Alhaarth began 1996 as the short-priced favourite for both the 2000 Guineas and the Derby although Hern was reported to be concerned by the colt's lack of physical growth. Alhaarth lost his unbeaten record on his three-year-old debut. He started 1/2 favourite for the Craven Stakes over a mile at Newmarket, but after taking the lead, he was caught in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Beauchamp King. Hern spoke positively after the race, saying \\"that will have done him good\\" but reportedly looked as despondent as \\"a man who had just had his tomatoes visited by blight\\". Despite the defeat, Alhaarth started 2/1 favourite for the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance just over two weeks later after doing well in an exercise gallop. He was held up in the early stages, but when asked to challenge he was unable to reach the leaders, and finished fourth, six lengths behind Mark of Esteem. Alhaarth was moved up to middle distances for his next two starts. In The Derby, he finished fifth behind Shaamit after meeting interference in running, but in the Irish Derby he came home ninth of the thirteen runners behind Zagreb. A return to one mile saw him take third places in the Sussex Stakes and the Celebration Mile before he was sent to France for the Prix du Rond Point at Longchamp on Arc day in October. Ridden by Richard Hills, Alhaarth led from the start and stayed on strongly to record his first victory in almost a year, beating the 1995 winner of the race, Shaanxi, by one and a half lengths. The victory was greeted enthusiastically by the British contingent, and Hern said that the performance gave him \\"great pleasure, because I know what a good horse he is.\\" =1997: four-year-old season= Alhaarth joined the Godolphin stable and spent the winter of 1996‚Äì7 in Dubai. He did not run however, until Royal Ascot, where he ran second to Bosra Sham in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. Twelve days later, he traveled to Ireland to win the Group Two Budweiser American Bowl International Stakes, taking the lead a furlong out to beat Gothenberg by a length. His next two starts were disappointing: he finished last of the nine runners in the Celebration Mile in August and a remote third, beaten more than 18 lengths behind Pilsudski in the Irish Champion Stakes. On his final start, Alhaarth returned to Longchamp in October in the Group Two Prix Dollar. He led from the start and was always \\"in command\\", winning by a length from Lord Cromby. Assessment Alhaarth was rated the best two-year-old to run in Europe during 1995, being awarded a rating of 126 in the International Classification, two pounds ahead of the Middle Park Stakes winner, Royal Applause.

The highway connects Jeddah, the second- largest city in the kingdom, on the western coast of Saudi Arabia to Dammam, the sixth-largest city on the eastern coast and the largest in the Eastern Province. Apart from Jeddah and Dammam, Highway 40 also runs near or through Makkah, Ta'if, Riyadh, Abqaiq and Khobar along its length, and provides access to the Mahazat as-Sayd and Saja and Umm Al Ramth wildlife sanctuaries.Tuwaiq escarpment, west of Riyadhalt=left The highway consists of three traffic lanes and an emergency lane on each side (a total of six traffic lanes and eight total lanes) separated by a median strip. All intersections of the highway are grade separated. The route traverses the mostly flat Najd plateau and thus, requires no bridges or tunnels for most of its length. Before reaching the western part, where it twists and turns around the Hejaz mountains in western Saudi Arabia, before reaching the west coastal plain. Several connector roads and highways connect the highway to other major roads and highways along its length. In 1953, the need to connect the capital, Riyadh, to the oil-rich economically prosperous regions in the east and the Islamic holy sites to the west arose. The project to build the section of the highway connecting Dammam and Riyadh began construction and was completed earlier than the western section, in 1961. This new road also connected Riyadh to the major agricultural areas in the oasis of al-Ahsa. In 1965, the western section of the highway connecting Riyadh and the Islamic holy sites in the west was completed as the primary east-west axis of the kingdom. In conjunction with the Kingdom's five-year plans, the Saudi Ministry of Transport prepared its own comprehensive plan, known as the Five-Year Road Programme. The first of these began in 1970 and the system is still implemented today. During the Third Development Plan (1980‚Äì85), the Riyadh‚ÄìDammam section of the modern-day highway was modernized and measured 375 km (233 mi). Finally, during the Fourth Development Plan (1985‚Äì90), the Riyadh‚ÄìJeddah section of the highway was modernized and in 1986, the highway was commissioned as Highway 40 in the new, standardised Saudi road network.  Route description  Highway 40 () is a major east-west six-lane controlled- access highway in Saudi Arabia, connecting Jeddah, the second-largest city in the kingdom, to the economically prosperous and oil-rich Eastern Province, making it the kingdom's only coast-to-coast highway. The highway runs in a northeast-southwest direction, traversing the width of the entire Arabian Peninsula. Being part of the Saudi road network, Highway 40 carries the Arab Mashreq Route 80M Jeddah‚ÄìMecca‚ÄìRiyadh‚ÄìDammam‚ÄìManama. The highway spans 1,334 km (829 mi) between Jeddah (at the interchange with Highway 5 near Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium) and Dammam at the interchange with Highway 613; via Riyadh. The route serves Mecca via the Umm al-Qura' Road, Ta'if via Highway 287 and Highway 267, Riyadh via Highway 522, Hofuf via Highway 75, Buqayq via Highway 607, and Khobar and Dhahran via Highway 95. It exhibits eight lanes across its entire length, three traffic lanes, with one emergency lane on each side. Highway 40 is a controlled-access highway with grade- separated ramps and like most of the other major highways in Saudi Arabia, almost all of the interchanges on the highway are cloverleaf interchanges, with the exception of U-turn interchanges, which are a variant of the grade- separated U-turn interchange. There are numerous rest areas along the highway, with some having the most basic of amenities such as just a petrol station and cafe, with others including restaurants, hotels, fast-food franchises, and almost all of them have a masjid, with recent regulations stating that there should be a travel time of no longer than 60 minutes between rest areas.The Gate of Mecca ( Bawabat Makkah), under which Highway 40 passes, west of Mecca.The highway begins at the intersection with Highway 5 near Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium in south Jeddah in the al-Waziriyah district of Jeddah. It leaves eastward, winding through the Hejaz mountains before reaching the haram boundary of Mecca. Between the two boundaries of the haram surrounding Mecca, Highway 40 turns northward and then back east along the northern perimeter of the holy city and even through the Jannat al-Mu'alla cemetery before turning back northeast toward Riyadh and exiting Mecca passing just south of Jabal al-Nur. Highway 40 then continues north-east and intersects Highway 50 at Dhalim. Highway 40 passes through some of Riyadh's most famous intersections, known as squares, even though these are purely dedicated to road transport. The most famous of these are Doha Square (Exit 1) and Rabat Square (Exit 4). The highway then continues north east after exiting Riyadh and reaches Greater Dammam, intersecting Highway 95, which carries 80M southward, before terminating at the intersection with Highway 613. All roads in Saudi Arabia are operated by the Saudi Ministry of Transport. For speed limit enforcement, most of the western portion of the highway uses radar, while the eastern and central parts use traditional cameras. Fog-prone areas, especially in the eastern parts, are marked with huge signs with light warnings and the speed limit is reduced to 15 kmph (9 mph) in the case of fog. In February 2018, it was announced that the speed limit on key highways in the Saudi road network was being raised to 140 kmph (87 mph) from the previous 120 kmph (75 mph) for private vehicles, and Highway 40 was included in these.  History  A sign on Highway 95 leading to the exit to Highway 40, with Mecca being denoted by the Kaaba and Medina denoted by the Green Dome In 1952, the Dammam-Riyadh railway line finished construction under Saudi Aramco, connecting the capital of the country to the oil-rich regions in the Eastern Province and to the headquarters of Saudi Aramco. With the arrival of petrodollars, the rise of the Saudi middle class and an increase in private vehicle ownership, the need to connect the Saudi capital to the Eastern Province and to the Islamic holy sites in the west by road arose in 1953 and the Ministry of Transport was founded the same year. The Riyadh‚ÄìDammam section of the highway was completed first in 1961, owing to Dammam's closer distance to Riyadh as well as the attraction of economic prosperity from the oil-rich regions in the east. With the completion of the eastern portion, the Saudi government now shifted focus to the west and the Riyadh‚ÄìJeddah section was completed in 1965. In 1969, the Ministry of Transport introduced the Five-Year Road Programme, in conjunction with the pre-existing five-year plans the Saudi government used. The first of these began in 1970, and the system is still used today. During the Third Development Plan (1980‚Äì85), the Riyadh‚ÄìDammam section of the highway, measuring 375 km (233 mi) was modernized to its present-day configuration and during the Fourth Development Plan (1985‚Äì90), the Jeddah‚ÄìRiyadh section completed its modernization. With the highway completely upgraded, the Saudi Ministry of Transport finally commissioned the highway, signing it Highway 40, in 1986. Since 1986, the highway has seen no change except for the addition of speed limit enforcement systems, with the sections west of the intersection with Highway 50 using radar and the sections east of it using a combination of traditional speed traps and radar. In February 2018, the speed limit on Highway 40, along with other major highways in the kingdom, was increased from 120 kmph (75 mph) to 140 kmph (87 mph) for private vehicles.

The game, set in the desolate, labyrinthine Aperture Science facility, challenges the player to navigate test chambers created by the artificial intelligence GLaDOS, using a portal gun, a device able to create portals that link two points in space like a wormhole. The game expands on the original Portal by adding new puzzle elements, such as paint that imparts properties to surfaces, plates that can launch the player and objects over distances, tractor beams and bridges made of light. The game's music includes original scores composed by Valve's Mike Morasky, and two original songs provided by Jonathan Coulton and the band The National. The bulk of the music was released as a freely-available download across three volumes, entitled Songs to Test By, and later in a four-disc retail Collector's edition that included music from Portal. \\"Want You Gone\\" Jonathan Coulton, who provided the song \\"Still Alive\\" for the first Portal, was asked to compose the game's final credits song, \\"Want You Gone\\". Jonathan Coulton's song \\"Still Alive\\", which is sung by GLaDOS (voiced by Ellen McLain) over Portals end credits, was considered a large part of Portal's success; in designing Portal 2, Valve desired to incorporate more music into the game, including further involvement from Coulton. Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, \\"Want You Gone\\", also written from GLaDOS's viewpoint. Coulton had discussed with Erik Wolpaw about whether an ending song would be necessary, and how they could create \\"an emotional moment\\" comparable to \\"Still Alive\\", back in 2009 when Portal 2s ending was not yet determined. Also available as iPad or Steam application. Other options were considered, such as several \\"joke songs\\" and false endings for the game. Ultimately the game's finale, where GLaDOS effectively \\"breaks up\\" with Chell, was set by the last quarter of 2010, and Coulton played the game as it had been developed to that point to generate ideas. Elements of the ending, such as Chell being told to leave Aperture with the door slamming behind her, led to the development of main chorus line \\"I used to want you dead, but now I only want you gone.\\" Coulton wrote the lyrics and composed the song over the course of several days, with John Flansburgh assisting on electronic drums, and traveled to Valve's headquarters in January 2011 to record it with McLain. In addition to its inclusion in the Portal 2 soundtrack, a version of \\"Want You Gone\\" as sung by Coulton appears on his 2011 album Artificial Heart. \\"Exile Vilify\\" The band The National worked with Valve to create the haunting \\"Exile Vilify\\" used in conjunction with one of the dens of the Rat Man within the game. The indie rock band The National provided another original song, \\"Exile Vilify\\"; its lyrics were composed by the group and reviewed by Valve to ensure they fit with the tone of one of the Rattmann's dens, where it appears in-game. The National had expressed an interest in doing music for Valve to Bug Music, their publishing label, which the label forwarded on to Valve in discussing other music opportunities for the game. Valve and Bug Music identified that The National would fit well into Portal 2, as their \\"raw and emotive music evokes the same visceral reactions from its listeners that Portal does from its players\\" according to Bug Music's spokesperson Julia Betley. The song is considered by Paste to be a \\"haunted, piano-lead ballad\\" similar to the band's song \\"Think You Can Wait\\" used in the film Win Win. \\"Exile Vilify\\" is not included in the freely downloadable Portal 2 soundtrack, but instead was released as a digital single by the band. After the game's release, Valve and The National ran a contest encouraging users to create their own music video for \\"Exile Vilify\\", offering as prizes Valve merchandise and a guitar signed by members of the band. Of 320 videos submitted, Valve ultimately awarded two videos first prize. One video featured a sock puppet that \\"had nothing to do with Portal\\" but \\"managed to beautifully capture the spirit of the song\\", while the other provided an animated retelling of the Lab Rat comic. Original music Valve's Mike Morasky was the lead composer for the game's backing music. In keeping with the theme from Portal, Morasky wanted to create music that kept an \\"old future through a new lens\\" approach, such as by using minimalist electronic piano or mangled chiptunes. He also wanted to create music that would sound like it would have been composed by a computer, citing the use of \\"stiff arpeggios, math-like voice leading, odd rhythm patterns and whole tone scales\\" as a means to achieve this. Morasky also incorporated the briefly-seen singing turrets--all voiced by McLain-- in the piece \\"Cara Mia Addio!\\" after recalling that she was a former opera singer, and used snippets of her singing to create something that still sounded synthetic. Except for McLain's vocals, all the music is based on synthesized or sampled sounds, and even with McLain, her voice was resampled to make it sound like a computer. Morasky created procedurally generated music, which is generated in real time based on the player's actions. This type of music system was based on the previous success of incidental music used in the Left 4 Dead series, and was developed to create a generalized platform for reuse in future Valve productions. Such music is generated by the player's interaction with various puzzle objects in the test chambers, such as launching from an Aerial Faith Plate. Morasky designed the procedure to build out the music more as the player completed more of each puzzle. Morasky also saw this as a means to provide experimentation to the player, exploring both space and timing of events to alter the composition of the music. Morasky claims that one piece of music \\"only repeats itself every 76,911 years, 125 days, 7 hours, 56 minutes and 30.3 seconds\\". Morasky designed this dynamic music as a reward for successfully completing puzzles. Songs to Test By Songs to Test By is the three-volume soundtrack for Portal 2, containing nearly all of the music from the game. The soundtrack was released freely to the Internet volume-by-volume between May and September 2011. Along with the soundtrack, Valve included several Portal 2-themed ringtones. =Soundtrack listing= A retail four-disc collection, Portal 2: Songs To Test By (Collector's Edition), was released on October 30, 2012 through Ipecac Recordings. Three of the discs include the music already available (listed above), while the fourth disc includes songs from Portal. A mini-comic, \\"Turret Lullaby\\", is also included. Reception Kym Dillon of IGN used the soundtrack of Portal 2, amongst a few other soundtracks, as an example how a game can use both source music (music that is part of the game environment) and underscoring (music that is only for the player) to create atmosphere in games; Dillon also mentions that he \\"especially\\" liked the game's soundtrack. Alyssa Grimley of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised Morasky's composing of the soundtrack and called it an \\"understated genius\\". She also praised Jonathan Coulton's song \\"Want You Gone\\" for the way in which it reflects the changed spirit of GLaDOS when compared to \\"Still Alive\\" from the first game. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku listed Portal 2 as possessing one of the best musical scores in video games for 2011, praising both the composed songs and the dynamically-generated elements. For the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, both \\"Want You Gone\\" and \\"Exile Vilify\\" were nominated for \\"Best Song in a Game\\", while the soundtrack was nominated for \\"Best Original Score\\". Portal 2s soundtrack was awarded for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\\" at the 15th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. The game was awarded the \\"Best Audio\\" 2012 Game Developers Choice Awards. The Game Audio Network Guild awarded Portal 2 with the \\"Best Interactive Score\\" (along with Kinect Disneyland Adventures), and \\"Best Original Vocal - Pop\\" for \\"Want You Gone\\".

They name the baby Krishna, because the way he was found parallels the legend of how the God Lord Krishna came to live with his adopted parents as a baby. Orphan Krishna (Namit Shah) lives happily in the orphanage with Kanta and Nattu and the other foundling children. But over the years, as one by one his other friends are adopted out to families but he remains, young Krishna comes to believe that he is unadoptable, unwanted, and will never find a family. In despair, all alone one night he goes to a temple and prays to Lord Krishna. This is the story of how Lord Krishna himself (in his mischievous childhood 'makhan chor' 'butter thief' avatar) comes to Earth and befriends the young orphan Krishna. Many adventures then ensue, as Krishna- from-Heaven helps Krishna-from-Earth to discover his family. Production Lead actress Juhi Chawla accepted the central role of Kantaben, the headmistress of the orphanage, in this children's movie for the sake of her own two children, then aged 11 and 9, who had particularly enjoyed the earlier My Friend Ganesha movies by this same director Rajiv S Ruia and made her realise how much children really enjoy and need such films specifically designed for a child audience. She also sang the playback recording herself for \\"Om Namo Namah\\", which is picturised throughout the opening credits. First-time producers Nandan K. Mahto and Promila Hunter are the longtime spot boy and hairdresser, respectively, of Hindi film superstars Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif, which is why Mr Roshan and Ms Kaif both readily agreed to be a part of their old friends' debut movie.http://bollyspice.com/28240/hrithik- and-katrina-at-main-krishna-hoon-music-launch Celebrated dance director Ganesh Acharya choreographed the big dahi handi number, \\"Govinda Aala Re\\", which featured Rajneesh Duggal and Misti Mukherjee in non-speaking special appearances as the lead male and female dancers.http://bollyspice.com/28240/hrithik-and-katrina-at-main-krishna-hoon- music-launch Music The music for Main Krishna Hoon is given by Amjad- Nadeem and consist of following Audio List. =Audio Listing= References External links * Category:2013 films Category:Indian films Category:Indian 3D films Category:Indian children's films Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:Indian films with live action and animation Category:Krishna in popular culture ","title":"Main Krishna Hoon"},{"id":"33269438","text":"The green carplet or glowlight carplet (Horadandia atukorali), is a species of very small cyprinid fish that is found in slow-moving or still fresh and brackish water habitats in western Sri Lanka.

Early life Walter Slade was the second son of the stockbroker Adolphus Frederick Slade (1804 to 1875) and his wife Charlotte Amelia Hulme. Walter's paternal grandfather, Henry Slade (1766 to 1834) was the first cousin of Sir John Slade, 1st Baronet. Adolphus Slade was a stockbroker, born in Battersea in 1804. He was forty years old when he married the nineteen-year-old Charlotte Amelia Hulme in 1844 in Battersea.\\"England Marriages, 1538‚Äì1973 \\", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NJ98-P69 : accessed 6 September 2015), Adolphus Frederick Slade and Charlotte Amelia Halme, 27 Aug 1844; citing Battersea, Surrey, England, reference p163rn325; FHL microfilm 254,533. With Charlotte he had twelve children, seven sons and five daughters. The children were born whilst the family resided at Kemnal House in Kent, leased by Adolphus until 1871. Adolphus sent his sons, including Walter, to study at Tonbridge School and at least four of them, again including Walter, followed him into the stock-broking business. Of Walter's siblings at appears that ten survived to adulthood (his brothers, Adolphus Hulme, Edmund, Ernest, Sidney and Herbert, and his sisters Fanny, Florence, Amy, Ada and Laura). His brother Percy appears to have died in infancy. By 1871, Adolphus claimed in the 1871 census that he was a \\"Landed Proprietor & Occupier of 246 acres of land ‚Äì Employing 23 labourers, 5 boys & 3 women\\", rather than a stockbroker.Kemnal Road history At school Walter was a noted sportsman, being in both the Cricket Eleven (1870-1) and the Football Thirteen, (1870).Hughes, Walter Oldham Hughes, The register of Tonbridge School, from 1820 to 1886, also lists of exhibitioners, &c.;, previous to 1820, and of head masters and second masters (1886), ([Reading, I.I. Beecroft, Printer]) He was also a noted runner at school and took this forward as an adult into the world of amateur running events. Athletics Walter Slade by contemporary accounts was a natural runner who trained very little. In England the professional milers, Lang and Richards, had set an 1865 record of 4:17.25 for the mile. However, the mile was also a popular event in amateur meets and there the 4:30 was still considered a barrier . This was first broken in 1868 by Walter Chinnery on 14 March 1868, running in at 4:29.75. Chinnery went on to found the London Athletic Club, but his record was broken on 3 April 1868 by Walter Gibbs.Edward Seldon Sears, Running through the ages, p114, (McFarland), 2001, , This record held until 1874 when a third Walter, Walter Slade, lowered the amateur record by taking over two seconds off the previous best, lowering the record to 4:26.00 at the Civil Service Sports meet in a race he won from scratch. This event was known as the Strangers' Open Mile, and it was at this race that in 1868 Chinnery had set his record previously. Walter Slade had already won the English Amateur Mile Championship in 1873, and went on to win it five years in a row from 1873 to 1877. In 1874 he was also the Four Mile champion. He lowered the mile record to 4:24.25 in 1875 at a London Athletic Club meet at Stamford Bridge. His record was to stand for four years until broken by William Cummings in 1880. Walter Slade was also on various occasions the fastest amateur on record for the half-mile, two miles and four miles. Slade was by contemporary accounts about six feet in height and weighing over eleven stone when in strict training. His style was described by Montague Shearman thus: \\"he ran heavily, crunching the cinders as he sped over the path.\\" Career Walter followed his father into stockbroking and became a Member of the London Stock Exchange. After moving to Australia he continued in this profession, setting up an office by 1881, becoming a Member of the Melbourne Stock Exchange, and becoming chairman of the Melbourne Stock Exchange by 1890.

The trademark Krishna Vamsi style and magic is missing in the film. The movie may appeal family audience. Mogudu is a mixed bag and the fans of Krishna Vamsi will not be fully satisfied with it\\". Rediff which gave a two stars said \\"Krishnavamsi's fascination for the family and for tradition is given full play in the film. The decibel levels are high: everyone is either shouting, screaming or hitting everyone else. Dialogues are tacky and it's all just one big high-voltage melodrama. On the whole, a disappointing film. NDTV said \\"The film is just an above average fare. It is a disappointment for the director's ardent fans who expect much from his films. However praised the lead performances, saying \\"Gopi Chand looks stylish in his designer wear. He is good in action sequences and shows his talent as a performer. But, it is Rajendra Prasad who steals the show with his stellar performance\\". Deepa Garimella of fullhyd.com praised the film's screenplay and the casting but said that the movie is a \\"disappointing, unfulfilling anecdote of a newly-wed husband and a wife dealing with an unpleasant family fracas\\", rating it 5 out of 10.

Design history In April 1941, it was decided to create a project for a new Super-heavy tank. It was supposed to be able to defeat any German heavy tank. The project was intended to remain an unbuilt design, until it was needed. Several tank designers were told to create basic concept drawings. Sources differ as to the designers involved. Design history. Basic armour was to be 125 to 130 mm and up to 150 mm over vulnerable areas. A new gun was required. There were about 20 different designs generated by the project. The lightest design was 82.5 tonnes and the heaviest was 107.7 tonnes. All had a 107mm ZiS-6 main gun and all but one had a second tank gun. The second gun was a 45 mm 20-K, or a 76 mm gun. Solutions to the positioning of the guns ‚Äì turrets or hull mountings ‚Äì varied. Crew requirements were from 5 to 9 men. =The 107 mm ZiS-6 guns= The F-42 107 mm tank gun was created in Plant #92, in a design bureau under the supervision of V. Grabin. The F-42 was based on the F-39 95 mm tank gun (see 107mm divisional gun) and it was finished in the autumn of 1940. By the beginning of 1941, the new gun had been factory tested in a field casemate. In March 1941 it was tested in the turret of a KV-2 tank. The ZiS-6 gun passed factory testing by June 1941, after which it was sent to the Artillery Scientific Test Range at Leningrad. According to V. Grabin (\\"Oruzhie Pobedy\\" - \\"Weapons of Victory\\") about 600 ZiS-6 guns had been finished by the autumn of 1941. Those guns were all destroyed because the tanks were never going to be made. The plants chief designer wrote that \\"five serially-produced ZiS-6 cannons were manufactured in July‚ÄìAugust 1941, after which their production was halted because the heavy tanks were not ready\\". Those documents had been signed by V. Grabin. =Concept Designs= 231210 kv4 02.gifProject Kreslavsky 231210 kv4 08.gifProject Kuzmin, Tarapatin and Tarotko 231210 kv4 07.gifProject Pereverzev Kv4ch4.jpgProject Mikhailov Kv4ch5.jpgProject Kruchenykh Kv4ch3.jpgProject Buganov 231210 kv4 01.gifProject Fedorenko Kv4 3.jpgProject Dukhov 231210 kv4 09.jpgProject Strukov 231210 kv4 10.jpgunknown Engineer Kv4ch1.jpgProject Schaschmurin Kv4ch6.jpgProject Zeiiz See also * List of Soviet tanks References Category:Heavy tanks of the Soviet Union Category:World War II tanks of the Soviet Union KV-4 Category:Abandoned military projects of the Soviet Union ","title":"KV-4"},{"id":"33269531","text":"William Bludworth is a fictional character in the Final Destination film series, portrayed by Tony Todd. He appears in Final Destination, Final Destination 2, and Final Destination 5. William Bludworth is the owner of Bludworth Funeral Homes and has the most knowledge of Death and its forces or capacities, and can basically be seen as the Grim Reaper throughout. Films =Final Destination (2000)= In the first film, Alex Browning and Clear Rivers sneak inside the morgue to glimpse at Tod Waggner's corpse. Bludworth catches them in the act and asks why they came. Offering his help, he explains to them the rule of Death: those who cheat death will be revisited by Death once more to claim back their lives which should've been lost. He also tells them about Death's List (a list of the order of deaths of the survivors in the original incident) and how it will work on them once again. Finally, he states that ruining the list can affect the remaining survivors. Bludworth claims that if Alex and Clear can figure out death's design, then they may have a chance to beat it. He warns them about the consequences of tampering with the design however by telling them, ‚Äúbeware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design...could initiate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper...and you don‚Äôt even want to fuck with that mack daddy.‚Äù =Final Destination 2 (2003)= In the second film, Bludworth is revisited by Clear, together with Kimberly Corman and Thomas Burke, to obtain help about cheating death. He is seen de-accessorizing the corpse of Evan Lewis. However, he only mentions to them the rule of life and death: new life can defeat Death. =Final Destination 5 (2011)= Despite being absent from the third and fourth films, Bludworth reappears in the fifth film. In this film, he is seen as a coroner who the characters encounter several times, and informs them only that by taking a life can they live, for they will receive the lifespan of the person they've killed. The point they neglect to realize however is that they have no way of knowing how long the person they would kill has to live on their remaining lifespan. Casting Tony Todd, famous for portraying the titular role in the Candyman films, played William Bludworth in Final Destination, Final Destination 2, and Final Destination 5. Todd's role is one of only two characters to appear in at least two films besides Ali Larter's character Clear Rivers. Tony Todd, who played Candyman in the 1992 film Candyman, was cast as mortician William Bludworth. Writer Glen Morgan initially wanted Todd for the role for his deep voice that would give the film an eerie tone. Reception Todd's performance in Final Destination has received positive reviews among critics. Joe Leydon of Variety complimented his performance, saying that \\"Todd --- an old hand at scary stories after the \\"Candyman\\" series --- overplays with enough relish to position himself as a probable returnee for a Final Destination 2.\\". Brett Gallman of Oh, The Horror! described Todd's wry and sinister portrayal \\"has crafted one of the genre's most memorable characters in recent memory though he's only appeared twice for about five total minutes in the series.\\" On the other hand, Todd's role in Final Destination 2 received mixed reviews among critics, most complaining about Todd's minimal screentime. Robert Koehler of Variety remarked that Todd's \\"single, distinctly flat scene\\" was wasted by the filmmakers. Gallman of Oh, The Horror! is enticed by Todd's role \\"whose purpose has still yet to be revealed in the franchise.\\" References External links * William Bludworth on IMDb Category:Fictional African- American people Category:Fictional characters from New York (state) Category:Final Destination characters Category:Film characters introduced in 2000 Category:Male horror film characters ","title":"William Bludworth"},{"id":"33269532","text":"The estuary is an important site for pied oystercatchers The Rubicon Estuary is an estuary on the central coast of northern Tasmania, south-eastern Australia, lying next to the town of Port Sorell.

The film stars the director himself alongside Srinivas, Anjali, and Sunitha Verma in the lead roles, while Asmitha and Alex play supporting roles. The music was composed by Srikanth Deva, while editing was done by LVK Doss. The film released on 29 July 2011 and became a critical and commercial failure. Plot Dr. Kanimozhi (Sunitha Verma) is drawn to Pottalam Ravi (Kalanjiyam) because of his life-saving act and ultimately decides to marry him. She overlooks Ravi's brutal past life, during when he had murdered many, including Sengudi (Asmitha), who was with him right from their childhood days. She loves him, but he appears quite satisfied by using her whenever he is driven by his sexual urge. Believing that she could change him for the better, Kani marries him after his return from prison after a jail term. Ravi looks like a changed man after emerging from jail and tells his wife that the talks that he had with some religious people made him a complete man. However, his real self comes out when he hears about Kani's good-looking patient Amudhanila Gunasekharan (Anjali) and her \\"inability\\" to give birth to a child. Ravi's evil mind springs back to life as his urge to have sex with Amudha increases. He gets close to her, pretending to be the doctor's assistant. Ravi almost succeeds in making Amudha believe that he had the \\"solution\\" to \\"cure\\" her problem. How Amudha is saved and how Kani treats her sex-maniac husband is what the script is all about.

India has always said that any peaceful agreement between North Korea & South Korea will be strongly endorsed. India has also cleared that it wants the reunification of Korea. According to 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 23% of Indians view North Korea's worldly influence positively, with 27% expressing a negative view.Negative views of Russia on the Rise: Global Poll History =Pre- modern relations= According to the 13th century chronicle Samguk Yusa, the ancient Korean queen Heo Hwang-ok came from a kingdom called \\"Ayuta\\". One theory identifies Ayuta as Ayodhya in India. In 2001, a South Korean delegation inaugurated a memorial to the queen in Ayodhya. A famous Korean visitor to India was Hyecho, a Korean Buddhist monk from Silla, one of the three Korean kingdoms of the period. On the advice of his Indian teachers in China, he set out for India in 723 CE to acquaint himself with the language and Indian culture. He wrote a travelogue of his journey in Chinese, Wang ocheonchukguk jeon or \\"An account of travel to the five Indian kingdoms\\". The work was long thought to be lost. However, a manuscript turned up among the Dunhuang manuscripts during the early 20th century. A rich merchant from the Ma'bar Sultanate, Abu Ali (P'aehali) Â≠õÂìàÈáå (or Â∏ÉÂìàÁàæ Buhaer), was associated closely with the Ma'bar royal family.

This poem is popular even today: > \\"In the golden age of Asia, Korea was one of its lamp bearers and That lamp > is waiting to be lighted once again for the illumination in the East\\" =Korean War= India condemned North Korea as an aggressor when the Korean War started, supporting Security Council resolutions 82 and 83 on the crisis. However, India did not support resolution 84 for military assistance to South Korea. As a non-aligned country, India hesitated to involve itself in a military commitment against North Korea. Instead, India gave its moral support for the UN action and decided to send a medical unit to Korea as a humanitarian gesture. The 60th Indian Field Ambulance Unit, a unit of the Indian Airborne Division, was selected to be dispatched to Korea. The unit consisted of 346 men including 14 doctors.Kim Chan Wahn. \\"The Role of India in the Korean War\\", International Area Studies Review, June 2010; vol. 13(2), pp. 21‚Äì37. India was chair of the 9-member UN Commission that monitored elections in undivided Korea in 1947. After the Korean War, India again played an important role as the chair of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in the Korean peninsula. =Recent relations= Consular relations were created on 1 March 1962, and The Consulate General of India in the DPRK was established in October 1968. An Indian Embassy in Pyongyang was established on 10 December 1973. Both states are members of the Non-Aligned Movement, underlining a common view on many international issues. India makes efforts to engage in dialogue to support peace and stability in Korea and tries to act as a bridge between North Korea and the Western world. India's relationship with North Korea has however been affected by North Korean relations with Pakistan especially due to its help for Pakistan's nuclear missile programme. In 1999, India impounded a North Korean ship off the Kandla coast that was found to be carrying missile components and blueprints. India's relations with South Korea have far greater economic and technological depth and India's keenness for South Korean investments and technology have in turn affected its relations with the North adversely. India has consistently voiced its opposition to North Korean nuclear and missile tests. As a consequence of United Nations Security Council economic sanctions, with effect from 7 March 2019, Indian citizens can not undertake capital account transactions with North Korean citizens. Also Indian Government has asked the existing investment transactions to be liquidated within a period of 180 days from the date of notification. Economic relations =Trade= Trade between India and North Korea has seen a large increase in recent years. From an average total trade of barely $10 million in the middle of the 2000s, it shot up to $60 million in 2013. The trade is overwhelmingly in India's favor, with its exports accounting for roughly $60 million while North Korean exports to India were worth $36 million. India's primary export to North Korea is refined petroleum products while silver and auto parts are the main components of its imports from North Korea. India participated in the sixth Pyongyang Autumn International Trade Fair in October 2010 and there have been efforts to bring about greater economic cooperation and trade between the two countries since then. In 2010‚Äì11, Indo-North Korean trade stood at $57 million with India's exports accounting for $32 million. Due to UNSC sanctions resolutions, trade except food and medicine, with DPRK with effect from April 2017 is restricted. The bilateral trade has declined considerably due to the UN Sanctions. =Food aid= In 2002 and 2004, India contributed 2000 tonnes of food grains to help North Korea tide over severe famine-like conditions. In 2010, India responded to North Korea's request for food aid and made available to it 1300 tonnes of pulses and wheat worth $1 million through the UN World Food Programme. India has contributed $1 million to the World Food Programme for its humanitarian activities in North Korea in the year 2019, the UN agency's monthly report released in November 2019 showed this, as the impoverished North struggles to cope with chronic food shortages. \\"WFP has intensified the South-South and Triangular cooperation as an avenue to enhance support to the DPRK and has received a contribution from the Government of India of $1 million for its in- country operations,\\" the report said. DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. =Medical aid= The Indian government sent $1 million worth of anti-tuberculosis medicine to North Korea per a request from the World Health Organization (WHO), according to a press release issued by the Indian embassy in Pyongyang.‚ÄúThe medical assistance is under the aegis of WHO‚Äôs ongoing anti-tuberculosis (TB) program in the DPRK,‚Äù the press release stated. The aid package was handed over to North Korean authorities by the Indian ambassador to the DPRK, Atul Malhari Gotsurve. The supply of anti-tuberculosis medicine, which is India‚Äôs latest set of humanitarian assistance to North Korea ‚Äî was sent because ‚ÄúIndia is sensitive to the shortage of medical supply‚Äù to the DPRK, the embassy stated. Recent visits =Year 2015= On 23 April 2015 North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong visited New Delhi, capital of the Republic of India for talks with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj on North Korea‚Äôs nuclear programme and to request additional humanitarian assistance but no agreement was reached because of the recent North Korean statement in support of Pakistan. =Year 2018= On 15 May 2018 Vijay Kumar Singh Gen.

The Irish Times. 20 June 2009. Holland was born in Inchicore, Dublin. A skilled association football player, he spent time in the United States, where he joined the US Marine Corps. Returning to Ireland in the 1960s, his first conviction for handling stolen goods was obtained at the age of 25, whilst working as the manager of a sausage company. At the time he had sympathies for and associations with both the Irish National Liberation Army and the Irish Republican Army. Having married in his mid 30s, by the mid-1970s he was suspected by the Garda S√≠och√°na of carrying out a number of armed bank raids. In 1981 he was jailed for seven years for armed robbery at a hotel in Ballsbridge. Released after four years, in 1989 he was sentenced to ten years for possessing 7¬Ωlbs of Frangex explosive,McElgunn, Joanne; \\"Dutchy takes Guerin lies to grave\\", The Sun 20 June 2009 detonators and fuse wire, allegedly for supply to the IRA. Whilst in jail, he met John Gilligan and members of his gang, whom he joined on release in 1994. Whilst running a legitimate printing business as the front for a forgery operation, Holland was suspected by the Garda√≠ of becoming a gun for hire, implicated in but never convicted of the killings of: Patrick Shanahan, shot in Crumlin in October 1994; publican Tom Nevin, shot in Jack White‚Äôs Inn, County Wicklow, in March 1996; Jimmy Redden, shot in a pub off Parnell Street, Dublin, in April 1996. Working alongside Charles Bowden in Gilligan's drugs gang, it was Bowden who supplied the gun which killed Guerin, a meeting attended by Holland. In 1997 while acting as a Garda witness, Bowden named Holland in a Dublin court as the man he supplied the .357 Magnum gun to, and hence suspected of shooting Guerin. In the wake of Guerin's killing, a period in which the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau made over 150 arrests to clear up Ireland's illegal drug problem, Holland was arrested at D√∫n Laoghaire ferry port on 9 April 1997. Initially arrested for involvement in Guerin's murder, after an inspection of his premises and assets he was eventually charged for possession and distribution of of cannabis. During the trial in Dublin, Garda√≠ officer Marion Cusack said that she believed Holland was the gunman who killed Guerin in her car. Sentenced to 20 years for drug distribution, it was reduced to 12 years on appeal. The CAB subsequently seized a small house near Brittas, County Wicklow, in compensation. Whilst in Portlaoise Prison, he befriended Colm Murphy, the first person to be convicted in connection with the Omagh bombing, but was resisted by his fellow members of the Real IRA from entering their area of the jail. Released from Portlaoise in April 2006, he flew to Rome, Italy where his lawyer Giovanni Di Stefano had arranged a series of psychological tests and press interviews, in which Holland strongly denied the murder of Guerin. Invited to appear on The Late Late Show, under public and political pressure the editorial board of RT√â vetoed the interview. Holland began mixing with a major Finglas drugs gang headed by Martin \\"Marlo\\" Hyland. After the Garda√≠ raided one of Hyland's houses and found Holland there, he made his way to England. In May 2007, a year after being released from jail in Ireland, Holland was arrested by the Metropolitan Police in London, who were investigating a honey trap plot to kidnap a businessman for a ¬£10 million ransom. After a month-long trial the jury unanimously convicted Holland together with John McDonnell, Gerard Booth and Khan Coombs of conspiracy to kidnap. Whilst serving the subsequent eight-year term, he was found dead in his cell at HMP Parkhurst, Isle of Wight on the morning of 6 June 2009. After his death, it emerged that Holland was planning to write an autobiography, having collated his notes via a series of recorded cassette tapes. These were handed by his family to the Irish Sunday Mirror, which subsequently published a series of articles in which Holland claimed that: yes, he was a bank robber by the early 1970s; he had set up a money-laundering network across Europe to hide his fortune from the CAB; he again denied the murder of Guerin.

Plot A young man, Roger Martin, is propositioned by the lawyer of a wealthy businessman, Arthur Barret, to sleep with his wife Eleanor for a large sum, as the couple wish to have a child but Arthur is sterile. At the first attempt Eleanor does not fall pregnant, but subsequent efforts yield success. However by then Roger is obsessed by Eleanor, believing he is madly in love, even though she makes it clear it is only a business arrangement and that she loves her husband. Arthur bans Roger from seeing Eleanor again, but Roger then threatens to expose the scheme, bringing disgrace to the family. Arthur then phones his lawyer to tell him of the problems Roger is causing. A young priest, Father Michael McKinnon, arrives in the parish and is introduced by the Senior priest to the Barrets as ‚Äúhis favourite family in the whole world‚Äù as they make large donations to the church. He is told to ‚Äúbefriend‚Äù them, but keeps declining their dinner invitations. Eventually he accepts, but ends up in an argument with Arthur about his brother‚Äôs financial investment with Nazi Germany. The furious Arthur throws him from his house, but Michael reveals that he is the son of his brother, ie Arthur‚Äôs nephew. Eleanor seems drawn to Michael, and goes to assist him with a pauper‚Äôs burial. Michael says that he always looks at the dead faces, and remembers them always. He opens the coffin, and Eleanor recognizes the face of Roger! In her shock she staggers backwards and falls into the empty grave. She is very traumatized and loses the baby. In the following days she shuns her husband, believing that he had Roger killed out of jealous hatred. Eventually she relents and they are reconciled. But then Eleanor starts to see more of Father Michael, and they develop a relationship which leads to love. Arthur has a lady running the house, Syril, who realizes that Eleanor is seeing Michael. She tells Arthur of this, but encourages him to allow it, as Eleanor can then fall pregnant again. One night Michael comes to the Barret mansion and breaks in to find Eleanor. Syril sees this happening but doesn‚Äôt prevent it. Eleanor then finds herself pregnant again, this time with Michael‚Äôs child. But she abruptly ends her relationship with him, and refuses to see him again. When Eleanor begins to give birth she is in agony, and thinks she may not survive. She sends for Father Dryer to minister last rites to her, but he is out of town. So Michael goes instead, but before the baby is born she dies. However the doctor is able to complete the delivery, with Michael assisting, and twins are born. Michael tells Arthur that they are his children, and that he will be taking them with him to England ‚Äì No Negotiation! As Eleanor is lying in her coffin in the church, Michael comes to see her, but is stopped when he realizes that Arthur and Syril are at the coffin. He stops short, and overhears Arthur asking Syril why she killed Roger. She explains that she poisoned him once Eleanor conceived as a favour to Arthur, whom she loves. Arthur refuses to accept her, and Michael then agrees to negotiate a compromise. A deal is reached, in which Arthur keeps the children, naming one Michael, while Michael remains at the Boston church. But Arthur has a large funeral for Eleanor ‚Äì with an empty coffin, whilst Michael buries her in a pauper‚Äôs coffin and grave. Afterwards Arthur brings some flowers to her grave, and says that she would have preferred that burial.

The day on which it is traditionally eaten is commonly known as the Laba Festival. The earliest form of this dish was cooked with red beans and has since developed into many different kinds. It is mainly made up of many kinds of rice, beans, peanuts, dried fruit, lotus seeds, etc. Depending on region-based variations in China, it can also include tofu, potato, meat and vegetables. History In the Han Dynasty, during the Laba Festival, people did not consume Laba congee as it was used for worshipping the gods. In the Northern and Southern Dynasties period, the date of the Laba Festival was fixed on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month. In the Song Dynasty, Laba congee was widely consumed throughout China by not only the common people, but also government officials and aristocrats. In the Qing Dynasty, the Laba Festival was sometimes celebrated as the \\"Spring Festival\\", and Laba congee became even more popular. In the imperial court, the emperor and nobles gave Laba congee to the officials, servants, and others.

ËÖäÂÖ´ËäÇÁöÑËµ∑Ê∫ê‰∏é‰º†ËØ¥ (The origins and legends of the Laba Festival) Some of these legends are: * The consumption of Laba congee is to commemorate the Song Dynasty general Yue Fei, who is widely regarded as a patriot and national hero in Chinese culture. * In Northern China, because it got really cold in the winter, so it became a tradition for people to drink Laba congee during winter to \\"stick their jaws\\" and thus their jaws can \\"stay attached\\" to their faces. * Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), the founder of the Ming Dynasty, used to live in poverty before he rose to power. He ate congee during those hard times. After becoming the emperor, he asked the people to eat congee as well. * SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama (the Buddha) once attempted to find the right path to awakening by starving himself. One day, when he was starved and weakened, he met a village girl who gave him milk and rice pudding (congee) after mistaking him for a spirit who granted her a wish.

Kits were also available from DSK Aircraft.Rogers, Bennett: 1974 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 100. Soaring Society of America, August 1974. USPS 499-920 Design and development The prototype VJ-23 was completed late in 1971 and in an era when foot-launched aircraft were Rogallo- style hang gliders, the VJ-23 was described as more of a foot-launched sailplane, with three axis controls. Jensen and Culver collaborated on the design from a concern about the safety of weight shift hang gliders as well as their structural integrity. The aircraft is predominantly made from wood and covered in doped Ceconite. The wing leading edge is made from poplar plywood and supported by nose ribs made from marine-grade plywood. The wing spar cap strips and tail ribs are fashioned from spruce. The tailboom is an aluminium tube. Its wing is cantilevered and tapered from wing root to wing tip. The VJ-23 lands and takes off on foot, but the aircraft is equipped with small wheels to allow it to be pulled up a hill. The aircraft's rigid wing structure requires that it be transported in a trailer, rather than rolled up and carried on a roof rack like a hang glider. To make construction easier and quicker the design was developed into the aluminium tube, strut-braced Volmer VJ-24 SunFun. Both the glider and powered VJ-24E version proved popular and a large number were built. Operational history One VJ-23E was flown across the English Channel.

Sauer. Sauer was a professor of geography at the University of California at Berkeley from 1923 until becoming professor emeritus in 1957 and was instrumental in the early development of the geography graduate program at Berkeley and the discipline of geography in the United States. Each generation of this research school has pursued new theoretical and methodological approaches, but their study of the peoples and places of Latin America and the Caribbean has remained the common denominator since the early 20th century. Carl O. Sauer himself did not develop a particular interest in Latin America before 1925, when Oskar Schmieder, a German geographer, disciple of Alfred Hettner, and expert in Latin American regional geography, arrived at Berkeley, coming from C√≥rdoba, Argentina, to work as an associate professor. Obviously, his interest awoke during Schmieder's presence between 1925 and 1930. After Schmieder's departure in 1930, Carl O. Sauer began to offer seminars on the regional geography of Latin America. First Generation Sauer graduated many doctoral students, the majority completing dissertations on Latin American and Caribbean topics and thereby founding the Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography.Scott S. Brown and Kent Mathewson, \\"Sauer's Descent?, Or Berkeley Roots Forever?,\\" APCG Yearbook 61 (1999): 137-57 Sauer's Ph.D. students who completed dissertations on Latin American and Caribbean topics are Fred Kniffen (1930), Peveril Meigs (1932), Donald Brand (1933), Henry Bruman (1940), Felix W.

Parsons became the most prolific in terms of directing Latin Americanist doctoral dissertations. He remained at the University of California at Berkeley and produced many of the Ph.D.s in the second generation of the Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography: Campbell Pennington (1959), William Denevan (1963), David Harris (1963), Thomas T. Veblen (1975), and Karl Zimmerer (1987). Third Generation One of the second generation, William Denevan, became a professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and, in turn, produced the majority of the third generation. Denevan's Ph.D. students who completed dissertations on Latin American topics are, among others, Daniel W. Gade (1967; co-chaired), Bernard Nietschmann (1970), Roger Byrne (1972), Roland Bergmann (1974), Billie Lee Turner II (1974), Stuart White (1981), Hildegardo C√≥rdova (1982), Gregory Knapp (1984), Kent Mathewson (1987), John M. Treacy (1989), and Oliver Coomes (1992). Subsequent Generations A member of the fourth generation, William E. Doolittle studied with Billie Lee Turner II, a prominent member of the third generation. Turner has graduated almost 50 PhD students, many working in the Americas like Anthony Bebbington, who has over 25 'fifth generation' graduated studentshttps://sites.google.com/a/asu.edu/turner/doctoral- adviseeshttps://wordpress.clarku.edu/abebbington/people/former-students/ Doolittle earned a Ph.D. in 1979, became a professor in the Department of Geography and the Environment at University of Texas at Austin, and is one person to extend the school into the fifth generation.

It weighs 5.25 pounds (2.4 kg). It has a short tail and a jawbone type visor with a brow reinforcing. Stylistically, it is termed a \\"high crowned\\" helmet, different from the style usually seen in Italy or Germany. A plume holder was added to the helmet at some time after its manufacture. History The helmet was made around 1460, during the period of English civil conflict known as the Wars of the Roses, and the armourer's marks suggest that it was made by an artisan originating from Italy. During the 19th century it was used in Coventry‚Äôs Godiva Procession. For a period it was kept on display at St Mary's Hall, Coventry, and is now shown at the city's Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. Very few pieces of English-made armour survive from this period; the Coventry Sallet is believed to be the only example of its type in England.

It was formed in 1972 by its first musical director, noted composer Louis Calabro, who was on the faculty of Bennington College. Sage City Symphony maintains its relationship with the College, relying on the campus for rehearsal and performance space. The Symphony attracts amateur as well as professional musicians without the requirement of auditions, drawn from Vermont, Massachusetts and New York states. It presents four concerts a year, starting rehearsals in September for a performance featuring a major orchestral work in November. The Symphony restarts rehearsals after the New Year for three concerts presented February through May: a Chamber Concert, Youth Concert and a final Spring concert featuring a significant orchestral work. The Symphony is led by musical director and conductor Michael Finckel. It is governed/supported by a working volunteer Board which appoints a Manager and a Librarian. Like the players, Board members come from surrounding areas of Vermont, Massachusetts and New York states. The Board contains a mix of orchestral players and longtime supporters from the business and academic community.

Samuel Ginn distinguished himself as a solicitor and was appointed to several important civic roles. He was elected to serve St Matthew's Ward in 1891 for the Liberal Party and was Mayor of Cambridge from 1897 to 1898.Cambridge City Council, Cambridge mayors 1890-1900: Samuel R.

By 1879 Ginn had moved his practice to new offices on 64 St Andrew's Street and had been appointed solicitor to the Cambridge Street Tramways Company. In 1880 he succeeded in obtaining parliamentary approval for the Company to extend the tramway system. In 1882 George Alfred Matthew joined Samuel Ginn to form the partnership of Ginn & Matthews and the firm moved next door to 63 St Andrews Street. Matthew had attended St John's College, Cambridge and served as President of the Cambridgeshire Law Society. He was married to Norah Eaden Lilley the daughter of the proprietor of the well known Cambridge Department Store, W. Eaden Lilley & Co for whom the firm acted. Ginn & Matthew continued to attract more business clients. In 1897 they are instructed by Chivers & Sons, jam makers of Histon and Hudson's Cambridge and Pampisford Breweries Ltd. Hudson's owned many of Cambridge's popular pubs some of which still exist today and in 1898 Samuel Ginn helped them to secure a ¬£75,000 debenture loan. In 1903 the firm assisted William Unwin of Histon in forming his company that went on to become the world-famous Unwins Seeds. Geoffrey Garland Goodman a law graduate of Pembroke College, Cambridge joined the partnership in 1903. He remained a partner for 47 years until his death in 1950, and had the difficult task of guiding the firm through the terrible events of both World Wars. George Matthew died suddenly aged 49 on 5 January 1905, in his office, and the name of the practice was changed to Ginn & Co. The following year Samuel Ginn‚Äôs son, Dennis Barton Ginn, was admitted as a partner after completing his law degree at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.Alumni cantabrigienses: a biographical list of all known students, graduates and holders of office at the University of Cambridge, from the earliest times to 1900, compiled by J.A. Venn, part II, vol. III, Cambridge: University Press, 1947, p.57. Shortly after John Edward Few of Willingham who had read law at King's College, Cambridge was admitted as a partner. Few had built up a reputation for his knowledge of Agricultural Law and lectured at the University. During the First World War, Captain Dennis Barton Ginn saw service in Dardanelles at the battle of Gallipoli and in Egypt, Palestine and France. In 1910 Dennis Barton Ginn's second son, Benjamin Dennis Skelton Ginn was born. He went on to become Major \\"Skelly\\" Ginn who used his electrical engineering skills to help to mastermind some of the most daring escape attempts from Colditz and other German PoW camps during the Second World War. In June 1919 Few left the partnership of Ginn & Co to found his own practice in Sidney Street which later became Few & Kester which was based in Montagu House, Sidney Street (opposite Ginn & Co) until it merged with Cunnigham John in 2004. In 1934 Samuel Reuben Ginn died aged 82 and left an estate valued at some ¬£5.5 million today with 150 acres of land in Huntingdonshire. He rewarded his loyal clerks at the firm with a bequest of ¬£200 each, around ¬£12000 today. Dennis Ginn succeeded his father as senior partner until his death in 1938 aged 59. In the same year his eldest son, Samuel Marsland Ginn, was admitted as a partner after reading law at Trinity Hall, but shortly afterwards saw service in the Second World War. On 3 December 1944 Major Samuel Marsland Ginn was killed in action, aged 32, at Venray in the Netherlands bringing an end to the Ginn association with the firm.

It was located on a site north of Holy Trinity and the former St Michael's parish churches in the centre of the city, on a site bordered by Priory Row to the south, Trinity Street to the west, and the River Sherbourne to the north. Excavated remains from the west end of the cathedral are open to the public. Origins The first chronicled event in the history of Coventry took place in 1016 when King Canute and his army of Danes were laying waste to many towns and villages in Warwickshire in a bid to take control of England, and on reaching the settlement of Coventry they destroyed the Saxon nunnery founded by St Osburg.Historic Warwickshire, Mary Dormer Harris, Memorials of Old Warwickshire, ed Alice Dryden, 1908 Leofric, Earl of Mercia and his wife Lady Godiva rebuilt on the remains of the nunnery to found a Benedictine monastery in 1043 dedicated to St Mary for an abbot and 24 monks.The history of Coventry Cathedral on the cathedral's website Retrieved on 28 September 2008 John of Worcester tells us that \\"He and his wife, the noble Countess Godgifu, a worshipper of God and devout lover of St Mary ever-virgin, built the monastery there from the foundations out of their own patrimony, and endowed it adequately with lands and made it so rich in various ornaments that in no monastery in England might be found the abundance of gold, silver, gems and precious stones that was at that time in its possession.\\"The Chronicle of John of Worcester ed. and trans.

This was known as the \\"Prior's-half\\", and the other was called the \\"Earl's-half\\" which would later pass to the Earls of Chester, and explains the early division of Coventry into two parts (until the Royal \\"Charter of Incorporation\\" was granted in 1345). In 1250, Roger de Mold (referred to in older documents as \\"Roger de Montalt\\"), the earl at the time who had gained his position by marriage, sold his wife's rights and estates in the southern side of Coventry to the Prior, and for the next 95 years the town was controlled by a single \\"land lord\\". However, disputes arose between the monastic tenants and those previously of the Earl, and the Prior never gained complete control over Coventry.\\"A Town of Two Halves?\\" on the historiccoventry website Retrieved on 28 September 2008 Architecture The remains of the east end of St Mary's, beside the current cathedral The main cathedral building was cruciform in shape, 425 feet (130 metres) long and 145 feet (44 metres) wide at the west front.\\"The building of Coventry's first cathedral\\" on the historiccoventry website Retrieved on 1 October 2011 It was constructed in two stages, up to 1143 and from c. 1150 to c. 1250. The cathedral had a central tower and two towers at the western end, the remains of which are still visible. It is believed there were three spires similar to, though pre- dating, those at Lichfield Cathedral. History The abbey church of St Mary's was consecrated in 1043, and Earl Leofric was buried there in 1057. In 1143 Robert Marmion fortified the partially built cathedral in an attempt to gain control of Coventry Castle. Part of his alterations include a trench around the church. In 1459 The Parliament of Devils was held during the Wars of the Roses in the chapter house of The Benedictine Priory. During Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, the king offered the cathedral buildings to the people of Coventry, however they were unable to raise sufficient funding, and the king ordered the buildings destroyed. Masonry and other items were removed and used for other purposes, leaving only parts of the cathedral standing.\\"Coventry dig on the Time Team website\\" Retrieved on 1 October 2011 It was the only English cathedral to be destroyed during the Reformation. In 1539 the seat of the diocese was transferred to Lichfield Cathedral, and it was renamed the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry. The north-west tower survived the destruction and was used as a house until 1714, when a charity school was founded there, Coventry's Blue Coat School. Coventry remained without a cathedral until 1918, when St Michael's parish church (built in the 14th and 15th centuries, and so originally standing simultaneously with St Mary's) was elevated to this status.Pepin, David (2004). Discovering Cathedrals. Osprey Publishing. p. 58. St Michael's was severely damaged during the Coventry Blitz on 14 November 1940 by the German Luftwaffe, and replaced after the war by the current St Michael's Cathedral. Rediscovery and excavations Remains of helical staircase in south-west tower View from Hill Top of the undercroft's excavation. Some of the area has been reburied. In 1856 the Blue Coat School was rebuilt on the same site, and during the construction the remains of the cathedral's west wall were discovered, including the foot of the south-west tower and its spiral staircase. The school building remains on the site, but the school itself moved to a new location in the 1960s. An excavation in the 1960s discovered the original doorway to the chapter house. In the late 1990s Coventry City Council decided to redevelop part of the cathedral site as a public park as part of its Phoenix Initiative, and invited the Channel 4 programme Time Team to perform an archaeological dig on the site. The dig took place in April 1999\\"Sent back to Coventry on the Time Team website\\" Retrieved on 1 October 2011 and consisted of four main trenches. One in the site of the chapter house, one to reach the original floor, four metres below the current ground level, and two to identify the locations of the two crossing piers which would have borne the weight of the tower and roof. The archaeologists digging in the chapter house were unable to locate the doorway that had been photographed during the 1960s excavations, and it was not until the third day of their three-day dig that they decided it must have been taken by the earlier team. This delay meant that it was not until the end of the final day that a stone- lined grave was discovered at the bottom of the trench. Several members of the team extended their dig into a fourth day to investigate this find more fully. Work on the fourth day revealed remains of a body in the grave just inside the chapter house door. Forensic examination carried out by the programme suggested that the person died in late-middle age and was overweight and diabetic. They concluded it was likely the man had been a prior. Time Team revisited the excavation site for a programme in March 2001 to explore some of the discoveries made since their earlier episode. Coventry Archaeology had continued a dig on the priory, while Northampton Archaeology carried out digs on the cathedral. One of the featured findings was a layer of clay around the entrance which still carried markings from the wheels of carts believed to have been removing stone after the building was demolished. Another discovery in December 2000 was the 14th century 'Apocalypse Mural'.\\"City diggers unearth 14th century treasure\\" on the Coventry Telegraph website Retrieved on 1 October 2011 During removal of debris from an undercroft, a small piece of masonry bearing a painted gold crown was discovered, and this discovery was followed several days later by a larger item. A piece of sandstone measuring 43 cm by 50 cm with a painted area covering 20 cm by 30 cm showing four heads, three of which are wearing crowns. Remains are visible from both ends of the cathedral building revealing a length of 425 feet. Following the excavations parts of the remains are open to the public as the 'Priory Garden' which can be walked through or above on wooden walkways. The site of the cloisters has also become a park with a visitor centre containing some of the artefacts excavated.

The roof of corrugated iron sheets is painted dark red, on the main gable the inscriptions read \\"A.D.1913\\" and \\"SADC Tribunal\\". Seven flagpoles with national flags of countries from the Southern African Development Community are mounted onto the pavement in front of the building. The Turnhalle () is a building in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. Built during the era of Imperial Germany colonisation of South-West Africa, it has been through a variety of uses, most prominently as the venue for the 1975‚Äì1977 Turnhalle Constitutional Conference, an attempt to quell armed resistance waged by the People's Liberation Army of Namibia against South African occupation. The Turnhalle housed the Tribunal court of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) until disbandment in 2012. Erection Turnhalle before its 1912/1913 extension Soon after the foundation of modern Windhoek in October 1890, a posh suburb developed on the slope of the hill opposite the city's railway station. The first Turners club, a German gymnastics association influenced by the suggestions of Turnvater Jahn, was founded in 1899. Exercise and practice took place where the Turnhalle stands today. A temporary corrugated iron structure was erected in 1905. On 6 March 1909, the foundation for a 22 m x 14 m gymnasium with high ceilings and a street-facing gable was laid. The Turnhalle building was inaugurated nine months later on 11 December 1909. The neo-classicist building of Wilhelmine architecture was regarded as \\"the most beautiful building in the northern part of town\\", and it was the first timber-girdered roof structure in the German colony. Soon the building grew too small for its purpose. A double-storey extension was appended on the western side of the building during the years of 1912 and 1913. The date inscription above the main entrance refers to this extension. Architect Otto Busch designed both parts of the building. Master architect Wilhelm Sander's proposal was ignored for the extension. Usage The Turnhalle was used for school physical training and gymnastic competitions, as well as for recreational sports. During World War I it accommodated South African troops. After a stage was added, the building was also used for theatre performances and cinema. After Namibian independence in 1990, the Turnhalle was used as conference venue, and for the National Council of Namibia, until that body moved to Tintenpalast. Afterwards it was earmarked to accommodate the SADC Tribunal court but burned down on 18 January 2007. It has been restored since then; the SADC Tribunal became operational in April of the same year. =Turnhalle Conference= When in the 1970s the South African administration came under increasing pressure to grant independence to the people of South-West Africa, it convened a conference tasked with the development of a constitution for a self-governed Namibia under South African control. This conference was named Turnhalle Constitutional Conference after the venue where it was hosted between 1975 and 1977. Sponsored by South African government, the Turnhalle Conference laid the framework for the government of South-West Africa from 1977 to independence in 1989. The conference was held in defiance of the 1972 United Nations General Assembly decision to recognise the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) as \\"sole legitimate representative\\" of Namibia's people.BBC News - Timeline: Namibia Consequently SWAPO, as well as other political groups rejecting apartheid, did not participate, and the United Nations rejected the conference and its proposals. As a result of the Turnhalle Conference the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) party was formed in 1977. It won the 1978 elections and formed an interim government. Also other, smaller parties carry Turnhalle in their name in reference to the Turnhalle Conference. The Namibia Democratic Turnhalle Party and the Rehoboth DTA Party both formed part of the DTA. =SADC Tribunal= From 2005 to 2012 the SADC Tribunal, the highest policy institution of the Southern African Development Community, was housed in the Turnhalle building in Windhoek. Although established on paper since 1992, members of the Tribunal were only appointed during the SADC Summit in 2005. On 18 November 2005 the Tribunal was inaugurated and the members were sworn in by Peter Shivute, Chief Justice of Namibia of the Namibian Supreme Court. Before the first case was heard by the Tribunal, the Turnhalle burned down on 18 January 2007. The court room was completely destroyed. Reconstruction work started in November 2007. In one of its first cases, Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v Republic of Zimbabwe the Tribunal ruled in 2007 and 2008 that the government of Zimbabwe could not evict farmer Mike Campbell from his land, and that farm seizures per Amendment 17 of the Zimbabwean constitution amounted to de facto discrimination against her white citizens. Following this ruling, Zimbabwe departed the SADC Tribunal and challenged its legitimacy. The 2010 SADC summit then ordered a review of the \\"functions and [...] terms of reference of the SADC Tribunal\\", a step that a group of legal and human rights organizations described as \\"virtually suspending\\" this inter-regional court. The Tribunal at that time had only four of ten judges appointed and did not accept nor hear any cases. SADC disbanded the Tribunal in 2012.

ISSN 1368-485X Design and development The Pouchel I was conceived in 1997 by French engineer Daniel Dalby. The aim was to design an easy-to-build ultralight aircraft based on the formula, principles and writings of Henri Mignet. The core of the construction employed commercial aluminium ladders in the fuselage and as spars in both wings. The wings were assembled using styrofoam ribs, and were fabric-covered. It was powered by a Fuji engine, developing less than 15 hp. Controls were similar to Mignet Pou- du-Ciel designs, with a pivoting front wing and rudder, both operated by the control column via control rods and no foot pedals. After test hops and modifications, on 26 June 1999, Daniel Dalby piloted the Pouchel on its first true flight at Salon Eyguieres.APEV website In 2002, after many plans had been sold to other amateur constructors, the ladder manufacturer refused to sell its products for this purpose, due to concerns about liability and insurance. The aircraft was then redesigned to replace the ladders with rectangular- section aluminium tubes (100 x 50 mm), becoming the Pouchel II, with a Rotax 447 engine and an empty weight of about . Subsequently, the Pouchel II was superseded by the APEV Pouchel Light, with an empty weight of about . A closely related aircraft in the same family is the APEV Demoichelle.

The series takes place in the near future and focuses on protagonist Kazuto \\"Kirito\\" Kirigaya and Asuna Yuuki as they play through various virtual reality MMORPG worlds. Kawahara originally wrote the series as a web novel on his website from 2002 to 2008. The light novels began publication on ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Bunko imprint from April 10, 2009, with a spin-off series launching in October 2012. The series has spawned nine manga adaptations published by ASCII Media Works and Kadokawa. The novels and the manga adaptations have been licensed for release in North America by Yen Press. An anime television series produced by A-1 Pictures, known simply as Sword Art Online, aired in Japan between July and December 2012, with a television film Sword Art Online: Extra Edition airing on December 31, 2013, and a second season, titled Sword Art Online II, airing between July and December 2014. An animated film titled Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale featuring an original story by Kawahara premiered in Japan and Southeast Asia on February 18, 2017, and was released in the United States on March 9, 2017. A spin-off anime series titled Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online premiered in April 2018, while a third season titled Sword Art Online: Alicization premiered in October 2018. An anime adaptation of Sword Art Online: Progressive has been announced. A live-action series will be produced by Netflix. Six video games based on the series have been released for multiple consoles. Sword Art Online has received widespread commercial success, with the light novels having over 20 million copies sold worldwide. The light novel series had good reviews, mainly on later arcs, while other series like Progressive were praised since the beginning. The anime series has received mixed to positive reviews, with praise for its animation, musical score and exploration of the psychological aspects of virtual reality, but criticisms for its pacing and writing. Synopsis =Setting= The light novel series spans several virtual reality worlds, beginning with the game, Sword Art Online (SAO), which is set in a world known as Aincrad. Each world is built on a game engine called the World Seed, which was initially developed specifically for SAO by Akihiko Kayaba, but was later duplicated for ALfheim Online (ALO), and later willed to Kirito, who had it leaked online with the successful intention of reviving the virtual reality industry. =Plot= In 2022, a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online (SAO) is released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba. On November 6, 10,000 players log into SAOs mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO, if they wish to be free. He also states that those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real- life deaths. One of the players, named Kazuto \\"Kirito\\" Kirigaya, is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of \\"beater\\", a portmanteau of \\"beta tester\\" and \\"cheater\\". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna Yuuki, forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game. In the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 SAO players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Asuna's father Shouzou Yuuki who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another SAO survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on \\"The World Tree\\" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called Alfheim Online (ALO). Assisted in-game by his cousin Suguha \\"Leafa\\" Kirigaya and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from SAO), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 SAO players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving ALO to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed a package program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive. One year after the events of SAO, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called Gun Gale Online (GGO), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named Shino \\"Sinon\\" Asada, he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in SAO. Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes. Kazuto is later recruited to test an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played, to help develop an artificial intelligence for RATH, a research and development organization under the Ministry of Defense (MOD), named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named Underworld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, when Black injures Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride, RATH recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. During his time in Underworld, Kirito befriends Eugeo, a carver in a small village of Rulid, and helps him on a journey to save Alice Zuberg, his friend who was taken by a group of highly skilled warriors known as the Integrity Knights for accidentally breaking a rule of the Axiom Church, the leaders of the Human Empire. During his time in the Underworld, he and Eugeo soon find themselves uncovering the secrets of the Axiom Church, led by a woman only known as \\"The Pontifex\\", and the true purpose of Underworld itself, while unbeknownst to them, a war against the opposing Dark Territory brewing on the horizon. Meanwhile, in the real world, conflict escalates as unknown forces raids RATH's facility in the Ocean Turtle in an effort to take A.L.I.C.E. for purposes unknown. With help from all his friends, Kirito manages to stop the attackers and safely extract A.L.I.C.E. from UW, who gains a physical body. One month later, Kirito and the others have their accounts forcibly migrated to Unital Ring, a new VRMMORPG which incorporates locations from all the other environments they previously visited, and investigate the cause while meeting some familiar faces. Production Reki Kawahara wrote the first volume in 2001 as a competition entry for the 2002 ASCII Media Works , but refrained from submitting it as he had exceeded the page limit; he instead published it as a web novel under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori.Afterword of the first light novel volume Over time, he added three further main arcs and several short stories, which like the first arc Aincrad, were later adapted into the light novels.Afterword of the sixth light novel volume In 2008, he participated in the competition again by writing Accel World, this time winning the Grand Prize. Aside from Accel World, he was requested to get his earlier work, Sword Art Online, published by ASCII Media Works. He agreed and withdrew his web novel versions. For the protagonist Kirito, Kawahara was asked if Kirito's personality and character were based on his own; he answered that he usually does not put aspects of himself into his characters, and jokingly remarked: \\"but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming parties. We [both] tend to play solo in these games a lot.\\" He also noted that the female characters in the story were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, stating: \\"I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don't know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable.\\" He added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, but rather decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. Kawahara also noted that the character of Asuna might have been created a little too perfectly. Media =Light novels= After Kawahara's request for Sword Art Online to be published was approved, he started working with illustrator abec on the light novel series. The first volume was published in print on April 10, 2009, and 20 volumes have been published as of September 8, 2017. The first eight volumes of the light novel series told the story arcs for Sword Art Online, Alfheim Online, and Gun Gale Online. The Alicization story arc was covered by volumes 9 through 18, while volumes 19 and 20 told a side story called Moon Cradle. Kawahara plans on writing \\"one more big arc\\" called Sword Art Online: Unital Ring that will go back to the real world, and it is the first arc not based on the original web novel. The Unital Ring story arc began in volume 21, which was released in Japan on December 7, 2018. Kawahara also writes the Sword Art Online: Progressive series, which covers Kirito's adventures on the first few floors of Aincrad. The first volume of Progressive was released on October 10, 2012, and six volumes have been released as of May 10, 2018. The first volume of a light novel series based on Sword Art Online titled Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online, written by Keiichi Sigsawa with illustrations by Kouhaku Kuroboshi, was published by ASCII Media Works on December 10, 2014. An original 100-page prequel novel to Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale written by Kawahara, titled Hopeful Chant, was released to people who watched the film in Japan during March 4‚Äì10, 2017. At their Japan Expo USA panel, Yen Press announced the rights to publish the light novels; the first volume was released on April 22, 2014. Yen Press later announced their license of the Sword Art Online: Progressive series, which is scheduled for release in 2015. The novels are also published in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, with future plans for publications in France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and others.

An 80-page assemblage of some of the Material Edition volumes was published on February 13, 2011; the latest release is Material Edition volume 25 on November 23, 2017. The author has also created some other d≈çjinshi including Lisbeth Edition, Silica Edition and Pina Edition under cooperation with Kurusu Tatsuya from ponz.info.

In February 2018, it was reported that the live-action series had been sold to Netflix. Reception According to Oricon, Sword Art Online was the top selling light novel series of 2012, with eight volumes figuring among the top selling light novels. It was ranked first in the 2012 and 2013 Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! rankings, as well as top five placement in 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and top 10 in 2019.

As of 2017, the series has an estimated 20 million copies in print worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku hails Sword Art Online as the smartest series in recent years, praising its deep insight on the psychological aspects of virtual reality on the human psyche, its sociological views on creating a realistic economy and society in a massively multiplayer online game setting, and the writing staff's ability to juggle a wide variety of genres within the series. Eisenbeis particularly noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing \\"definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world.\\" However, at the time of this preliminary review, he had only watched the first 12 episodes of the series. He has since gone on to review the second half of the series, lauding its excellent use of plot twists and praising its well-written and believable villain. However, he felt that some of the initial positive aspects of the series were lost in the second half, such as the focus on psychological repercussions and social interactions that could be realistically seen in an online game. Criticism was also levied towards the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress, stating that a female lead as strong as her was \\"reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for.\\" Eisenbeis closes his review of the series by stating in regards to the two halves, \\"Both, however, are enjoyable for what they are.\\" Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network has criticized the series as having pacing problems, logical gaps and \\"sloppy writing\\". Theron Martin of Anime News Network criticized the story as struggling \\"to achieve and maintain the level of gravitas that life-or-death danger should have\\", while calling it unwilling to commit to Kirito's \\"lone wolf\\" image. DeviceCritique explained that Sword Art Online influences the virtual reality market to grow, and referenced the Oculus Rift as a prime example of the starting point of virtual reality. It also praised Sword Art Online for exploring the psychological and social aspects of virtual reality gaming. While the anime received more criticism in western media, the light novels received praise mainly in latter arcs like Mother's Rosario and Alicization. In the Alicization arc, Anime News Network reviewer Theron Martin praised many of the volumes, saying that the author's writing has improved and he says for volume 16 that while not his favorite, the volume does its job well. The same reviewer also praised Sword Art Online for the same arc Alicization when it received an anime adaptation, with same praising for the second part of the arc on the anime called Alicization War of the Underworld, citing that, \\"The technical merits seem to be on the same level as the first half, including an amazing cabin design for Alice and Kirito's dwelling, some vibrant color work on the autumnal trees, and effective musical choices. Together they do an excellent job at conveying the various emotions present here: warmth, fear, frustration, and melancholy. Overall, this is a strong establishment episode for the next part of the story and about the best adaptation that could be hoped for of the relevant source material.\\" Cultural impact Kirito makes a cameo appearance in the eighth episode of the anime series Eromanga Sensei, with Yoshitsugu Matsuoka reprising his role. Steven Spielberg's 2018 film Ready Player One contains a reference to Sword Art Online. Ernest Cline, the writer of 2011 novel Ready Player One, discussed Sword Art Online in an interview, noting how he met its writer Reki Kawahara at an event in Japan where they discussed how they independently developed similar ideas related to virtual reality.

Background On 15 April 1808, a day after the Swedish 2nd Brigade had crossed the border into Norway, the Swedish 3rd Brigade crossed the Swedish-Norwegian border from T√∂cksmark and occupied the eastern side of R√∏denessj√∏en and √òymarksj√∏en.Angell, p. 83 From there, the Swedes had established outposts to the south and up to Hemnes. The Swedish commander, Colonel Bror Cederstr√∂m, also ordered the creation of barricades, especially at √òrje, where he had his headquarters. The skirmish at Lund At the time of the Swedish 3rd Brigade's invasion, Prince Christian August's primary concern was the Swedish breakthrough after the battle of Lier and the Swedish advancements towards Kongsvinger. However, he was concerned that the Swedish 3rd brigade could move northward and cut off large numbers of Norwegian troops.Olsen, p. 320 On 20 April, he sent two companies under Captain Heyerdahl and Captain Zarbell against Hemnes to stop a possible Swedish advance. When the rumor that the Swedes were advancing reached the Norwegian companies, Captain Heyerdahl decided to pull his company back to Fetsund, while Captain Zarbell stationed his troops west of the farm Lund, east of Hemnes Church. From there he eventually moved towards the farm, where his troops clashed with a Swedish J√§ger Corps. After the brief skirmish, the Swedes withdrew almost half a mile back to Opsal and Krok in R√∏denes, where the most northern Swedish positions were located.Oppegaard, p. 167 When Colonel Cederstr√∂m was told about the retreat, he ordered the company commander to advance again and confront the Norwegian company, which had stationed itself at Lund. This order was carried out and the Swedish forces tried repeatedly to drive Zabell's company out of Lund, but in vain. When they had lost a quarter of their troops, the Swedes chose to withdraw back to Opsal.Angell, p. 84 Fighting on 5 May After the victory at Trangen, Christian August felt that the Swedish pressure against Kongsvinger had calmed down. He sent more troops to face the Swedes' 3rd brigade at R√∏denes.Angell, p. 117 On 4 May, Major Andreas Samuel Krebs was sent over Aurskog against Hemnes to regroup with Captain Zarbell together with three companies from the J√§ger Corps, four grenadier companies, some sharpshooters and a cavalry division from Akershusiske dragonregiment.Olsen, pp. 324-325 That same evening Captain Zarbell and his sharpshooters, together with Lieutenant Hegge and his 3. jegerkompani, were sent forward to the Swedish positions at Opsal. There Zarbell at once chose to attack the Swedish positions, but was not able to drive the 150 Swedish troops from the 1. S√∂dermanlands bataljon from their positions. It was not until he got support from Major Krebs' main force that the Swedes were driven back to the Krok farm, further east, where they entrenched themselves.Angell, p. 118 Major Krebs chose to continue to pursue the Swedes and began to advance towards their position. But it turned out that the Swedes had a relatively strong position since the Norwegians first had to cross the river Opsal, and then attack the Swedish position on the hill where the Krok farm lay. Captain Butensch√∏n's company was the first Norwegian company who managed to get across the river and then went on to attack the Swedish right flank. But soon the rest of the j√§gers got across and started to threatened the Swedes from several positions The Swedes abandoned their position at Krok and retreat back to a new position at J√•vall, about a mile farther south. This position was also soon abandoned after several assaults from the Norwegians. The Swedes fell back to √Öseby, only to be forced to retreat once again. It was only at Askerud, about a mile north of √òrje, that the Swedes managed to halt the Norwegian advance, and since the Norwegian troops were exhausted, Major Krebs chose not to carry out any new assaults on the Swedes' position.Angell, pp. 118-119 However, on the morning of 6 May, Krebs received an order from Prince Christian August to fall back. This was done in silence, and the Norwegians avoided being pursued. Attack on √òrje bridge The same day that Major Krebs had been ordered to retreat, Major Fischer, who was in position at Mysen, was ordered to move against the Swedish positions near √òrje bridge.Angell, p. 120 The next morning, on 7 May, Fischer began to advance with sharpshooters of the 4. jegerkompani and two companies from the Nordenfjelske Regiment against √òrje bridge. Near the bridge the Swedish outposts were quickly defeated, and the Norwegians moved up to the fortified bridgehead, which the Swedes had built on the west side of river, defended by 120 men of the Dalbataljonen. But since Fischer chose to stop the attack in order to prepare before storming the bridge, the Swedish commander, Captain T√∂rnblad, managed to get across, and subsequently gave the order to set fire to the bridge. Thus it was impossible for the Norwegians to get across, and Fischer decided to pull his troops back.Oppegaard, p. 168 Aftermath Although the Swedish forces still stood on Norwegian soil, the Norwegian troops had managed to stop their advance and to drive them back. This meant that the Swedish initiative to reach and capture Christiania by advancing through Smaalenenes Amt was greatly reduced, or gone. Many of the Norwegian soldiers, especially the j√§gers, who had fought in R√∏denes, received awards.Angell, p. 121 Lars Opsal received the most prestigious award; he was granted a sword with silver booklet for his boldness, courage and knowledge in the fighting.

The Votec 322 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a steel-tube fuselage, wooden wings with a carbon fibre fuselage skin, and a conventional landing gear with a steerable tailwheel. The aircraft is powered by a Lycoming AEIO-540 flat-six piston engine driving a three-bladed tractor propeller. Later a four-bladed propeller was installed to reduce noise.

The campus opened in Lake Havasu City, Arizona in the Fall of 2012 and focuses on an experiential, student-centered approach to learning. The education and experience a student receives at ASU Havasu is akin to that of a private liberal arts college, with the name and resources of a large state school.  History  Entrance of ASU Havasu from University Way. The \\"ASU Colleges\\" model was formulated in 2009 as an initiative to offer high quality, undergraduate degrees at lower costs. The Arizona Board of Regents, along with the presidents of each public Arizona university, were tasked with coming up with models of offering baccalaureate degrees to help prepare students for real world careers. In order for the idea to work, the city in which the college would be located would have to raise the funds for a physical location of the campus. Several locations throughout Arizona were highlighted, but the one city that pushed for the campus was Lake Havasu City, AZ. With support from generous Lake Havasu citizens, business owners, city officials, and non- profit organizations, $2 million was raised in an effort to renovate a previous middle school site for the ASU Havasu campus. The fundraising efforts were coordinated by the Havasu Foundation for Higher Education (HFHE), a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, that was started in 2004 by Dr. Bill Ullery. The HFHE was started as an initiative to highlight the importance of higher education in the Mohave County area. The HFHE continues to offer fundraising opportunities for campus projects and scholarships for new and current students.  Academics  =Academic Programs= ASU Havasu offers an interdisciplinary approach to student education and curriculum. There are currently 18 bachelor's degrees and 3 exploratory programs that students can choose from. The bachelor's degrees are as follows: Applied Computing (B.S.), Biology (B.S.), Biology (Environmental Science)(B.S.), Business (Business Administration)(B.A.), Business (Communication)(B.A.), (Communication)(B.A. and B.S.), Environmental Science (B.A. and B.S.), General Studies (B.A.), Health Education and Health Promotion (B.S.), Kinesiology (B.S.), Organizational Leadership (B.A.), Political Science (B.A.), Psychology (B.A. and B.S.), and Sociology (B.A.). The exploratory programs are as follows: Exploratory Health and Life Sciences, Exploratory Humanities, Fine Arts and Design, and Exploratory Social and Behavioral Sciences. = Tuition and Financial Aid = Martha Bennett Scholars of ASU Havasu enjoy a dinner with donor, Dean Barlow. The base tuition and fees for the 2016-2017 academic year is $9,954 for non-residents and $6,536 for AZ residents. The lower tuition makes ASU Havasu a viable option for students in neighboring states who want to move out of state for college. According to the website, \\"9 in 10 ASU at Lake Havasu students receive some form of financial aid.\\" Students at ASU Havasu can apply for the same scholarships as any other Arizona State University student. Freshmen students are also automatically evaluated for the New American University Scholarship These scholarships are pro-rated at a level that makes them comparable to the percentage of the award received by students attending the other Phoenix-area campuses with the higher tuition rates. Additionally, students attending ASU Havasu can receive scholarships from private donors of the campus, but all awards are contingent on funding. = Faculty = Contrary to the models of some branch campuses, ASU Havasu currently has full-time, doctorate level faculty who physically teach students at ASU Havasu. There are currently 15 full-time instructors and 7 adjunct faculty members. = Degrees Awarded = Since the opening of the campus is 2012, ASU Havasu has graduated 58 students. ASU Havasu Graduates from the Spring 2016 Convocation.  My Havasu Plan and Senior Capstone Projects  Students at ASU Havasu follow a path of experiential learning during the quest for his or her baccalaureate degree. The My Havasu Plan is a strategy used to develop leadership skills, community involvement, and real world experience for each student. = Freshman Year = Freshmen students work with a local community group and a faculty advisor to create a \\"Freshman Experience Project.\\" Past examples include:  Political Candidacy Program  > \\"Working with the Lake Havasu Area Chamber of Commerce, a group surveyed > past and present political candidates on their interest in funding a > political candidacy program. Based on the survey results, they determined > there is a need for political training in Havasu, as candidacy programs are > not available. Through support from other local Chamber of Commerce > chapters, the students were able to create a political candidacy program to > serve the needs of the city.\\"  Cat Tail Cove Survey  > \\"A duo of students work with Arizona State Parks by surveying and collecting > data from winter visitors about their interests in having additional > amenities at state parks that are no longer governmentally funded. This > project helped identify other funding ventures to help develop better > amenities in Arizona‚Äôs state parks.\\" = Sophomore Year = Sophomore students are encouraged to become involved and/or start a student club. There are currently 12 student clubs on campus, all of which have been organically started by students going through this plan. Student clubs include, but are not limited to the Outdoor Pursuits Program, Digital Media Organization, Environmental and Community Outreach, and a Lake Havasu Changemaker Central branch. Students are also encouraged to take part in study abroad trips. The 2015-2016 academic year included trips to Cuba, Costa Rica, and Quebec. = Junior Year = In a student's junior year, they are encouraged to earn an internship in the Lake Havasu area. The school currently has partnerships with the Lake Havasu Unified School District, the Lake Havasu Area Chamber of Commerce, and the Lake Havasu City Convention and Visitor's Bureau. Future partnerships are being determined for upcoming semesters. = Senior Year = A student in his or her senior year will complete their Senior Capstone Project. This project is comparable to the work a graduate student completes in a master's program. Alongside a faculty advisor, the student will tackle an issue of his or her choice and conduct field analysis on the topic. They will then analyze the data, develop a research paper and presentation, and propose the findings in an open forum at the end of their last semester. Facilities = Residence Hall = In March 2015, ASU purchased the motel that sat on the Northwest corner of the lot where ASU Havasu is situated. As phase 1 of the project, the 20 outer rooms were gutted and renovated. For the first time since opening in fall of 2012, ASU Havasu had on-campus housing for the fall of 2015. Phase 2 of the residence hall project took place in the summer of 2016. 11 rooms in the middle building were renovated to accommodate for increasing enrollment in the fall of 2016. There are double, single, and ADA compliant rooms, each costing $5,700, $6,500, and $6,000, respectively. = Dedication Wall and Student Center Patio = A dedication wall sits in the center of campus. The wall commemorates the efforts of the Lake Havasu City community in raising $2 million to start the campus. Behind the wall rests the student center. The patio of the student center boasts one of the best views of Lake Havasu and the surrounding mountain ranges. The view of Lake Havasu from the ASU Havasu Student Center Patio.

It is designed to closely duplicate the performance of the historic .300 Winchester Magnum cartridge, yet to be chambered in a short length action rifle. The cartridge was designed by Hornady and Sturm Ruger in partnership and released commercially in 2008 and chambered in various Ruger rifles. Design & Specifications The .300 Ruger Compact Magnum uses a unique case designed by Hornady and Ruger based on the powerful .375 Ruger cartridge. The case is of a rimless design having the base and rim diameter of which is the same diameter of the belt on belted magnum cases based on the .300 H&H; Magnum and .375 H&H; Magnum. This allows the cartridge to have a greater case capacity than a belted magnum case given cases of equal length. As Ruger intended the cartridge to be chambered in short length bolt-action rifles the case length was shortened to which is similar to the .308 Winchester case. Unlike Winchester Short Magnum cartridges, the Ruger Compact Magnums share the same diameter from case head to body. This allowed Ruger to chamber the cartridge without extensively redesigning their M77 rifle to adopt them to the new Ruger cartridge. While the .300 H&H; Magnum is longer than the .300 Ruger Compact Magnum, the latter cartridge has a greater case capacity than the former. This is due to the .300 H&H; Magnum having a long tapered body while the .300 Ruger Compact Magnum follows modern cartridge designs in that it has very little taper and a sharper shoulder.

The.300 Ruger Compact Magnum's greater case capacity, and the \\"short fat\\" cartridge efficiency lead to increases in the neighborhood of 150 fps over the H&H; cartridge and is essentially the same performance as the .300 Winchester Magnum or .300 WSM.

() is a 2012 Telugu-language fantasy romantic comedy film directed by A. Karunakaran. It was simultaneously shot in Tamil as Yen Endral Kadhal Enben!, and stars Ram and Tamannaah. The movie was produced by Sravanthi Ravi Kishore and features music scored by G. V. Prakash Kumar and dialogues penned by Kona Venkat. The film deals with love between two souls across two different eras. Both Ram and Tamannah play dual roles in the film, with each of those pairs of roles set in 1980 and 2012 respectively. This film's plot is mostly based on an American romantic comedy fantasy film Just like Heaven (2005) which itself is derived from french novel If Only It Were True. The Tamil version, Yen Endral Kadhal Enben!, never saw a theatrical release. Plot The film begins with Vizag being shown in 1980 in which a ladies college bus makes its scheduled bus stop. Krishna (Ram), standing at the bus stop, keeps looking at Srinidhi (Tamannaah), whom he loves, but does not express it. He has been doing that for the last three years but without any response from her. Srinidhi also likes Krishna but does not reveal it, as she fears that by doing so, she may put her family in trouble. On the last day of the college, Krishna decides to propose to her, so he disguises himself in a 'burqa' and boards the bus. However, the bus conductor recognises him and forces the bus driver to stop the bus. However, before he could stop it, the bus gets involved in an accident. Krishna saves Srinidhi from the mishap but is killed in the process. Shocked about Krishna's death, Srinidhi dies at his grave. The film moves to 2012 in Paris, where Sravanthi (Tamannaah), daughter of the Indian Ambassador to France (Suman) and a medical student, is leading a stifling life due to her father's security around her. She wants to break away from this life and live with freedom. She fantasizes an unidentified person in her dream every day, falls for him, and she promises her friends to marry him if her dream comes true, whoever he may be. One day, when her father had to leave the country due to his professional commitments, she stealthily escapes from her home and goes on a tour of the whole countryside with her friends and is able to free herself at last from the security around her. Ram (Ram) is a happy-go-lucky guy who is a headache to his father (Sayaji Shinde) as he does not take life seriously. So his father tricks him and sends him to Paris for a job, which he arranges through his friend Pulla Reddy (Nagineedu) without Ram's knowledge. One day, Ram sees Sravanthi standing on a railing of the bridge over a river and forces her to get down. They soon get acquainted, and friendship blossoms between them. Meanwhile, Sravanthi's father is worried that she has not returned since he left and asks his Chief Security Officer DK (Richard Rishi) to find her. Sravanthi and Ram both want to leave for India. Ram gets his passport by bluffing Sravanthi's father. However, at the airport, he is not able to find Sravanthi and leaves for India alone. After reaching India, he finds Sravanthi to his surprise at the airport. She tells him to meet a specific doctor in a specific hospital and disappears. On meeting the doctor, he finds Sravanthi in the hospital ICU. Sravanthi reveals that Ram has been talking to her soul. She went into a coma after an accident, which was a part of conspiracy hatched by DK and his agent in India, Koka Bhai (Kona Venkat). Only Ram can see and hear her, owing to their previous lives. Ram protects Sravanthi's body when he notices that any harm to her body will harm the soul, by taking her to his aunt's (Anu Hassan) hospital. His aunt tells him that she can survive and come out of coma if and only if a German medicine is given three doses at exactly the same time (every two days) but at different periods. She goes to a very powerful person who can sense beneath the lives and asks him why only Ram can see Sravanthi. The person tells her it is the will of god and after she goes from there he replies to his student that this is happening because Ram and Sravanthi's love failed since the past six lives and it wants to fulfil itself in this last life. The first dose is given to Sravanthi's body without much of a problem. Meanwhile, DK tries to kill Sravanthi by having her body kidnapped, but Ram is able to rescue her body and give the second dose. In the end, DK gets hold of Ram when he goes to get the last dose of medicine. After a fight, Sravanthi is given the third and last dose but DK removes the oxygen cylinder and its supply to Sravanthi. He somehow saves her and she recovers, but fails to recognise Ram. Sravanthi's father arrives at the very moment and gets Ram arrested for cheating him, but he later apologises to Ram after learning of the risk he faced to save his daughter, and gets ready to leave Paris that night with Sravanthi. Their car tyre gets punctured and meanwhile, Sravanthi sees the same location she witnesses in her dream and also sees a person kicking a coke tin which hits her. When she goes towards him to see him, the person is none other than Ram. Sravanthi is surprised to this and when she touches Ram's hand she recollects everything that happened between them this life even in her soul form and expresses her love by hugging him. At last, they both get married. Cast * Ram as Ram / Krishna * Tamannaah as Sravanthi / Srinidhi * Richard Rishi as DK, the security commander of Sravanthi's father and the main antagonist * Suman as Sravanthi's father and the Indian Ambassador to France * Sayaji Shinde as Ram's father * Y.

However, he backed out in the last minute due to budget constraints. Sravanthi Ravi Kishore and Ram decided to do the film \\"at any cost as this script has the potential to be made as a bilingual\\". The shooting of the movie started at the end of July 2011 and it took the crew of the film 118 days to complete. The film was shot in Geneva, Switzerland and France over a period of 60 days. The film was shot simultaneously in Tamil and was named Yen Endral Kadhal Enben, with each shot remade twice. Incidentally, this was Ram's debut film in Tamil. Ram had to learn gymnastics to shoot for a song which delayed the shoot for two months. Kona Venkat, who is the dialogue writer for the film, made his debut in this film as one of the antagonists. \\"After narrating the dialogues of my character\\", says Venkat, Karunakaran was convinced that \\"he could only see me and insisted that I do it\\". Rishi was selected to play the character of DK, a security commander and the main antagonist, in the film. \\"This is a new dimension, as a villain I missed dancing with the heroines but I believe that a villain should have a strong aim\\" says Rishi, who previously played the lead roles in films like A Film By Aravind, Bhagyalakshmi Bumper Draw. The film's failure at the box office meant that the Tamil version of the film did not have a theatrical release. The movie ends with the message that love does not die. Release The film received a clean \\"U\\" Certificate from the Censor Board of Film Certification. It was scheduled to release on 11 May 2012. But release was postponed as it coincided with the release date of Pavan Kalyan-starrer Gabbar Singh. The film was finally released worldwide on 8 June 2012. =Critical reception= The film mostly received mixed reviews. Idlebrain.com didn't give any rating for the film but criticised that the \\"screenplay is not gripping, romance feel is ineffective and run-time is excessive for this kind of subject\\". Rediff.com has given a rating of 1.5 out of a scale of 5 for the film and declared that \\"Endukante Premanta disappoints\\". It criticised the script for its \\"loopholes\\" but praised the lead pair of Ram and Tamannah as the \\"heart and soul of the film\\". Oneindia.com said that it's \\"Ram's show\\" and that \\"if only the youngsters enjoy the slow pace then it is sure to be another hit for Ram and Karunakaran\\". Bharatstudent.com had given a rating of 2.75/5 for the film and suggested that it \\"could have been better\\". Greatandhra.com had given 2.5/5 for the film and described it as \\"a soul shuttling between death, coma and life\\". Cinegoer criticised the director of the film and said that the film \\"is downright ridiculous, we'd rather see his montage shots on Youtube than sit through this montage film\\". The Times of India rated the film at 2.5/5 and said that the film is \\"overall, a very underwhelming experience that only comes off in bits and pieces\\". The Hindu criticised the film to be \\"like a montage of different films\\" and director for \\"throwing logic to the wind\\", but praised the lead pair of the film for having \\"done their best to bring some semblance of reality to this fantasy\\". CNN-IBN too felt that the film \\"is far from being perfect\\" and that \\"the climax is not one bit convincing\\". However it praised the cast for its performance and the director for his \\"bold experiment\\". Soundtrack The audio of the film was released on 29 April 2012 and launch of the audio was held at annapurna studios on same day. G. V. Prakash Kumar composed the soundtrack, which received positive response. Musicperk.com rated it 7.5/10 quoting \\"A refreshing musical album which is cool, lovely, soft, breezy, lively and yet trendy\\".http://www.musicperk.com/endukante-premanta/ References External links * Category:2012 films Category:Indian films Category:Telugu-language films Category:Films directed by A.

Newspaper vending machines are used worldwide, and they are often one of the main distribution methods for newspaper publishers. According to the Newspaper Association of America, in recent times in the United States, circulation via newspaper vending machines has dropped significantly: in 1996, around 46% of single-sale newspapers were sold in newspaper boxes, and in 2014, only 20% of newspapers were sold in the boxes. History The coin operated newspaper vending machine was invented in 1947 by inventor George Thiemeyer Hemmeter. Hemmeter's company, the Serven Vendor Company, was based in Berkeley, California, and had been making rural mail tubes and honor racks. The new invention could be adjusted to accept coins of different denominations (depending on the cost of the paper sold). The newspaper rack was able to be used with one hand, and took around 30 seconds to dispense a paper. Two models, one with a capacity for 1250 pages of newsprint, the other 2500 pages, were brought into production initially. By 1987, over one million machines had been distributed. One of the most popular newsrack manufacturers is Kaspar, a Shiner, Texas- based wire works company famous for their Sho-Racks. A 1984 Los Angeles Times news rack =Legal issues= In the United States, publishers have said that the distribution of newspapers by means of street racks is \\"an essential method of conveying information to the public\\" and that regulations regarding their placement are an infringement of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 1983, the city of Lakewood, Ohio adopted an ordinance that gave the mayor of the city complete control of where newspaper racks could be placed, and which newspapers could be placed in them. On June 17, 1988, this ordinance was overturned by the United States Supreme Court in a 4-3 ruling, citing that the ordinance could potentially be used to penalize newspapers that criticize the local government. =Re-purposing= A newspaper vending machine in Mississippi, USA The newspaper vending machines began to lose popularity as many newspapers switched to online distribution, and as newspaper prices rose; as most vending machines are completely mechanical with no moving parts, few of them have paper currency validators which need some kind of electrical power to work, requiring multiple quarters or dollar coins to be inserted. This is especially true for Sunday newspapers (for example, the Sunday New York Times costing $6 nationally and requiring 24 quarters in a vending machine), which see machines go unfilled by some papers due to the bulk of those editions reducing the number of copies that can possibly be sold. By 2009, various artists and inventors had begun working on re-purposing the boxes. Criticism Newspaper vending machines have been criticized for occasionally failing to distribute a newspaper after it has been paid for. Additionally, the design makes it possible for money or newspapers to be stolen from the machine. Newspaper machines are frequently cited by economists when discussing \\"utility value\\". Due to their design, one could insert the requisite amount and remove more than one copy of the newspaper. However, a second copy of a newspaper normally represents little value to the thief, as the information contained within the copies is identical; thus, the potential lost revenue due to stolen copies is mitigated by the low value that the average person places on a second copy of a newspaper. However, the potential for theft of additional copies is obviously problematic when a copy of the newspaper in question has potential future value, such as on the day after an election, sports event, or major world occurrence.

Some reflections on Professor Ray Beverton, FRS, 1922‚Äì1995. ICES/CIEM Information, 27: 16. Achievements Much of the foundations of quantitative fisheries science were laid out in On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations which Ray Beverton and Sidney Holt wrote at the Fisheries Laboratory, Lowestoft (UK). In his review of the 1993 reprint of the book, Ray Hilborn writes \\"It is remarkable how the book has stood the test of time and still provides a survey of the important topics in fisheries management\\". The book has a new reprint from 2004, with a foreword by Sidney Holt. Beverton was also one of the first to acknowledge the variation of life histories that exists in fish, and the importance of this in fisheries management. This was the topic of the symposium Building on Beverton's legacy: Life history variation and fisheries management, organised in 2003 during the 133rd annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society. The legacy of the 1957 Beverton and Holt treatise is commemorated in the volume Advances in Fisheries Science. 50 years on from Beverton and Holt. The volume includes a foreword by Sidney Holt. Beverton was the editor of Journal du Conseil, now ICES Journal of Marine Science, from 1983 to 1991. Among many other posts, he was the Deputy Director of the Fisheries Laboratory, Lowestoft. Beverton stayed active until his late years; he was involved in several papers published after his death, the last one nine years afterwards. Outside fisheries science, Beverton is best known for the Beverton‚ÄìHolt model. In population ecology the model is used as a stand-alone discrete time population model or as a model of density dependence in larger population models. Originally the model had a more specific usage; it was devised to describe the dependence of recruitment on spawning stock biomass. =Beverton Medal= The Fisheries Society of the British Isles awards each year the Beverton medal \\"to a distinguished scientist for a lifelong contribution to all aspects of the study of fish biology and/or fisheries science, with a focus on ground-breaking research.\\" The history of the medal goes back to 1995 when the society decided to award a medal to an individual who had contributed significantly to fisheries biology. Ray Beverton was the first recipient, but he died soon afterwards. The medal was then named in his honour.  References   External links  * E. Anderson: Standing on the shoulders of giants.

The tradition of the tangena ordeal, which has taken various forms over time, dates to at least the 16th century in Imerina, the central highland kingdom that would eventually come to rule the population of nearly the entire island four centuries later. It has been estimated that the poison may have been responsible for the death of as much as 2% of the population of the central province of Madagascar each year on average, with much higher mortality rates at specific periods, such as during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I (1828-1861), when the ordeal was heavily used. The belief in the genuineness and accuracy of the tangena ordeal was so strongly held among all that innocent people suspected of an offence did not hesitate to subject themselves to it; some even showed eagerness to be tested. The use of ritual poison in Madagascar was abolished in 1863 by King Radama II, but its use persisted for at least several decades after being officially banned. Etymology Tangena comes from the highland (official) dialect of the Malagasy language. History The precise dates and origins of the tangena ordeal on Madagascar are unknown. The 19th century transcription of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, references the use of tangena by the Merina king Andrianjaka (1612-1630), describing changes in its practice. This early 17th- century king imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice: rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.Kent (1970), p. By Andrianjaka's time, the ordeal was already a well-established and respected form of traditional justice, suggesting the practice must have originated no later than the 16th century.Callet (1908), p. In the early 19th century, tangena constituted one of the chief measures by which Queen Ranavalona maintained order within her realm. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles (andriana) or freemen (hova) were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while among members of the slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt.Oliver (1886), p. Those who died were declared sorcerers. According to custom, the families of the dead were not permitted to bury them within the family tomb, but rather had to inter them in the ground at a remote, inhospitable location, with the head of the corpse turned to the south (a mark of dishonor). According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, in the eyes of the greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory. On average, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of those who underwent the ordeal died. In the 1820s, the tangena ordeal caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population. The tangena ordeal was outlawed in 1863 by Radama II. Furthermore, Radama decreed that those who had died from the tangena ordeal would no longer be considered guilty of sorcery, and their bodies could once again be buried in family tombs. This decree was hailed with joy and prompted mass re- interments, as nearly every family in mid-19th century Imerina had lost at least one family member in a tangena ordeal.Chapus (1953), p. 32 Despite this royal decree, the practice continued secretly in Imerina and openly in other parts of the island.De Maleissye (1991), p. One of the key conditions that Radama's widow, Rasoherina, was obliged to accept by her ministers before they would agree to her succession, was continued adherence to the abolishment of the tangena ordeal.Cousins (1895), p.Randriamamony (), pp. 529-534 Notes References  Cousins, William Edward.

Their application can be found in signal processing and computer vision as descriptors of the signal or image. The descriptors can later be used for classification purposes. It is obtained by performing orthogonalization, via eigen analysis on geometric moments.M. K. Hu, \\"Visual Pattern Recognition by Moment Invariants\\", IRE Trans. Info. Theory, vol. IT-8, pp.179-187, 1962  Framework summary  EigenMoments are computed by performing eigen analysis on the moment space of an image by maximizing Signal to Noise Ratio in the feature space in form of Rayleigh quotient. This approach has several benefits in Image processing applications: # Dependency of moments in the moment space on the distribution of the images being transformed, ensures decorrelation of the final feature space after eigen analysis on the moment space. # The ability of EigenMoments to take into account distribution of the image makes it more versatile and adaptable for different genres. # Generated moment kernels are orthogonal and therefore analysis on the moment space becomes easier. Transformation with orthogonal moment kernels into moment space is analogous to projection of the image onto a number of orthogonal axes. # Nosiy components can be removed. This makes EigenMoments robust for classification applications. # Optimal information compaction can be obtained and therefore a few number of moments are needed to characterize the images.  Problem formulation  Assume that a signal vector s \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^n is taken from a certain distribution having coorelation C \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^{n \\\\times n} , i.e. C=E[ss^T] where E[.] denotes expected value. Dimension of signal space, n, is often too large to be useful for practical application such as pattern classification, we need to transform the signal space into a space with lower dimensionality. This is performed by a two-step linear transformation: q=W^T X^T s, where q=[q_1,...,q_n]^T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^k is the transformed signal, X=[x_1,...,x_n]^T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^{n \\\\times m} a fixed transformation matrix which transforms the signal into the moment space, and W=[w_1,...,w_n]^T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^{m \\\\times k} the transformation matrix which we are going to determine by maximizing the SNR of the feature space resided by q. For the case of Geometric Moments, X would be the monomials. If m=k=n, a full rank transformation would result, however usually we have m \\\\leq n and k \\\\leq m. This is specially the case when n is of high dimensions. Finding W that maximizes the SNR of the feature space: SNR_{transform} = \\\\frac{w^TX^TCXw}{w^TX^TNXw}, where N is the correlation matrix of the noise signal. The problem can thus be formulated as {w_1,...,w_k}=argmax_w \\\\frac{w^TX^TCXw}{w^TX^TNXw} subject to constraints: w_i^T X^T NX w_j=\\\\delta_{ij}, where \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta. It can be observed that this maximization is Rayleigh quotient by letting A=X^TCX and B=X^TNX and therefore can be written as: {w_1,...,w_k}=\\\\underset{x}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}} \\\\frac{w^TAw}{w^TBw}, w_i^TBw_j=\\\\delta_{ij} = Rayleigh quotient = Optimization of Rayleigh quotientT. De Bie, N. Cristianini, R. Rosipal, Eigenproblems in pattern recognition, in: E. Bayro-Corrochano (Ed.), Handbook of Computational Geometry for Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, Neurocomputing and Robotics, Springer, Heidelberg, 2004G.Strang, Linear Algebra and Its Applications, second ed., Academic Press, New York, 1980. has the form: \\\\max_w R(w)= \\\\max_w \\\\frac{w^{T}Aw}{w^{T}Bw} and A and B, both are symmetric and B is positive definite and therefore invertible. Scaling w does not change the value of the object function and hence and additional scalar constraint w^{T}Bw=1 can be imposed on w and no solution would be lost when the objective function is optimized. This constraint optimization problem can be solved using Lagrangian multiplier: \\\\max_w {w^{T}Aw} subject to {w^{T}Bw}=1 \\\\max_w \\\\mathcal{L}(w) = \\\\max_w (w{T}Aw-\\\\lambda w^{T}Bw) equating first derivative to zero and we will have: Aw=\\\\lambda Bw which is an instance of Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP). The GEP has the form: Aw=\\\\lambda Bw for any pair (w,\\\\lambda) that is a solution to above equation, w is called a generalized eigenvector and \\\\lambda is called a generalized eigenvalue. Finding w and \\\\lambda that satisfies this equations would produce the result which optimizes Rayleigh quotient. One way of maximizing Rayleigh quotient is through solving the Generalized Eigen Problem. Dimension reduction can be performed by simply choosing the first components w_i, i=1,...,k, with the highest values for R(w) out of the m components, and discard the rest. Interpretation of this transformation is rotating and scaling the moment space, transforming it into a feature space with maximized SNR and therefore, the first k components are the components with highest k SNR values. The other method to look at this solution is to use the concept of simultaneous diagonalization instead of Generalized Eigen Problem. = Simultaneous diagonalization = # Let A=X^TCX and B=X^TNX as mentioned earlier. We can write W as two separate transformation matrices: W=W_1W_2. #W_1 can be found by first diagonalize B: P^TBP=D_B. Where D_B is a diagonal matrix sorted in increasing order. Since B is positive definite, thus D_B>0. We can discard those eigenvalues that large and retain those close to 0, since this means the energy of the noise is close to 0 in this space, at this stage it is also possible to discard those eigenvectors that have large eigenvalues. Let \\\\hat P be the first k columns of P, now \\\\hat{P^T}B\\\\hat P=\\\\hat{D_B} where \\\\hat{D_B} is the k \\\\times k principal submatrix of D_B. #Let W_1=\\\\hat{P} \\\\hat{D_B}^{-1/2} and hence: W_1^T B W_1=(\\\\hat P \\\\hat{D_B}^{-1/2})^TB(\\\\hat P \\\\hat{D_B}^{-1/2})=I. W_1 whiten B and reduces the dimensionality from m to k. The transformed space resided by q'=W_1^TX^Ts is called the noise space. #Then, we diagonalize W_1^T A W_1: W_2^T W_1^T A W_1 W_2 = D_A, where W_2^T W_2 =I. D_A is the matrix with eigenvalues of W_1^T A W_1 on its diagonal. We may retain all the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors since the most of the noise are already discarded in previous step. #Finally the transformation is given by: W=W_1W_2 where W diagonalizes both the numerator and denominator of the SNR, W^TAW=D_A, W^TBW=I and the transformation of signal s is defined as q=W^TX^Ts=W_2^TW_1^TX^Ts. = Information loss = To find the information loss when we discard some of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors we can perform following analysis: \\\\begin{array}{lll} \\\\eta &=& 1- \\\\frac{trace(W_1^TAW_1)}{trace(D_B^{-1/2}P^TAPD_B^{-1/2})}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=& 1- \\\\frac{trace(\\\\hat{D_B}^{-1/2}\\\\hat{P}^TA\\\\hat{P}\\\\hat{D_B}^{-1/2})}{trace(D_B^{-1/2}P^TAPD_B^{-1/2})} \\\\end{array}  Eigenmoments  Eigenmoments are derived by applying the above framework on Geometric Moments. They can be derived for both 1D and 2D signals. = 1D signal = If we let X=[1,x,x^2,...,x^{m-1}], i.e. the monomials, after the transformation X^T we obtain Geometric Moments, denoted by vector M, of signal s=[s(x)],i.e. M=X^Ts. In practice it is difficult to estimate the correlation signal due to insufficient number of samples, therefore parametric approaches are utilized. One such model can be defined as: r(x_1,x_2)=r(0,0)e^{-c(x_1-x_2)^2}, Plot of the parametric model which predicts correlations in the input signal. r(x_1,x_2)=r(0,0)e^{-c(x_1-x_2)^2} where r(0,0)=E[tr(ss^T)]. This model of correlation can be replaced by other models however this model covers general natural images. Since r(0,0) does not affect the maximization it can be dropped. A=X^TCX=\\\\int_{-1}^{1}\\\\int_{-1}^{1}[x_1^j x_2^i e^{-c(x_1-x_2)^2}]_{i,j=0}^{i,j=m-1}dx_1dx_2 The correlation of noise can be modelled as \\\\sigma_n^2\\\\delta(x_1,x_2), where \\\\sigma_n^2 is the energy of noise. Again \\\\sigma_n^2 can be dropped because the constant does not have any effect on the maximization problem. B=X^TNX=\\\\int_{-1}^{1}\\\\int_{-1}^{1}[x_1^j x_2^i\\\\delta(x_1,x_2)]_{i,j=0}^{i,j=m-1}dx_1dx_2 B=X^TNX=\\\\int_{-1}^{1}[x_1^{j+i}]_{i,j=0}^{i,j=m-1}dx_1=X^TX Using the computed A and B and applying the algorithm discussed in previous section we find W and set of transformed monomials \\\\Phi=[\\\\phi_1,...,\\\\phi_k]=XW which produces the moment kernels of EM. The moment kernels of EM decorrelate the correlation in the image. \\\\Phi^TC\\\\Phi=(XW)^TC(XW)=D_C, and are orthogonal: \\\\begin{array}{lll}\\\\Phi^T\\\\Phi& = & (XW)^T(XW) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & W^TX^TX\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & W^TX^TNXW\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & W^TBW\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & I\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}  Example computation  Taking c=0.5, the dimension of moment space as m=6 and the dimension of feature space as k=4, we will have: W= \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cccc} 0.0 & 0 & -0.7745 & -0.8960 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2.8669 & -4.4622 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 7.9272 & 2.4523 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -4.0225 & 20.6505 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & -9.2789 & -0.1239 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -0.5092 & -18.4582 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right) and \\\\begin{array}{lll} \\\\phi_1&=& 2.8669x - 4.0225x^3 - 0.5092x^5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi_2&=&-4.4622x + 20.6505x^3 - 18.4582x^5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi_3&=&-0.7745 + 7.9272x^2 - 9.2789x^4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi_4&=&-0.8960 + 2.4523x^2 - 0.1239x^4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} = 2D signal = The derivation for 2D signal is the same as 1D signal except that conventional Geometric Moments are directly employed to obtain the set of 2D EigenMoments. The definition of Geometric Moments of order (p+q) for 2D image signal is: m_{pq}=\\\\int_{-1}^1\\\\int_{-1}^1 x^py^qf(x,y)dxdy. which can be denoted as M=\\\\\\\\{m_{j,i}\\\\\\\\}_{i,j=0}^{i,j=m-1}. Then the set of 2D EigenMoments are: \\\\Omega=W^TMW, where \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{\\\\Omega_{j,i}\\\\\\\\}_{i,j=0}^{i,j=k-1} is a matrix that contains the set of EigenMoments. \\\\Omega_{j,i}=\\\\Sigma_{r=0}^{m-1}\\\\Sigma_{s=0}^{m-1}w_{r,j}w_{s,i}m_{r,s}. = EigenMoment invariants (EMI) = In order to obtain a set of moment invariants we can use normalized Geometric Moments \\\\hat M instead of M. Normalized Geometric Moments are invariant to Rotation, Scaling and Transformation and defined by: \\\\begin{array}{lll} \\\\hat m_{pq} & = & \\\\alpha^p+q+2\\\\int_{-1}^{1}\\\\int_{-1}^{1}[(x-x^c)cos(\\\\theta)+(y-y^c)sin(\\\\theta)]^p\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & \\\\times [-(x-x^c)sin(\\\\theta)+(y-y^c)cos(\\\\theta)]^q\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & \\\\times f(x,y)dxdy,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} where: (x^c,y^c) = (m_{10}/m_{00},m_{01}/m_{00}) is the centroid of the image f(x,y) and \\\\begin{array}{lll} \\\\alpha&=&[m_{00}^{S}/m_{00}]^{1/2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta&=&\\\\frac{1}{2}tan^{-1}\\\\frac{2m_{11}}{m_{20}-m_{02}} \\\\end{array} . m_{00}^{S} in this equation is a scaling factor depending on the image. m_{00}^{S} is usually set to 1 for binary images.

Shamoon and directed by Agnieszka Holland. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards. Based on true events during German occupation of Poland, the film tells about Leopold Socha, a sewer worker in the Polish city of Lw√≥w. He used his knowledge of the city's sewer system to shelter a group of Jews who had escaped from the Lw√≥w Ghetto during the Holocaust in Poland.  Plot  In Darkness is a dramatization of a rescue of Jewish refugees during World War II in the German-occupied city Lw√≥w (Lemberg in German, L'viv in Ukrainian). For over a year, a Polish Catholic sewer maintenance worker and burglar, Leopold Socha along with his friend and co-worker Szczepek Wr√≥blewski, hid and cared for a group of Polish Jews who had escaped the massacres and deportations during the liquidation of the Lw√≥w Ghetto. At first the men demand daily payment for their help but they continue to aid the group long after the Jews' money has run out and aiding them had become ever more dangerous. The Jewish ghetto had been established in 1941 and the Nazis decided to liquidate it in June 1943. The Soviets took over Lw√≥w city in July 1944, by which point Socha's band made up 10 of the fewer than 1,000 surviving Jews in the city. Socha's and Wr√≥blewski's actions and those of their wives led to their recognition as Righteous Among the Nations recipients.

The last survivor of the group, Krystyna Chiger, published a memoir of her experience, The Girl in the Green Sweater: A Life in Holocaust's Shadow (2008). It was not a source for the film, as Holland was unaware of the book prior to the film's release Dowell, Pat. Poland's Holland, Exploring Holocaust History Again. National Public Radio, 19 February 2012. This was the first full-length film shown at the 23rd Polish Film Festival in America in Chicago on the Opening Night Gala.  Reception  As of October 2020, a majority of film critics have given the film a positive review. In Darkness has an approval rating of 88% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 111 reviews, and an average rating of 7.59/10 . It also has a score of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". A review by Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it \\"a harrowing nail-biter of a movie\\". Ella Taylor of NPR wrote In Darkness \\"satisfies for the intensity of the performances and for the artful contrasting of life on the teeming streets of L'viv with life and death in the dim, rat-infested sewers\\", adding that it \\"is often a thrilling adventure picture ‚Äî as if Anne Frank had found an Inglourious Basterd to help her make The Great Escape\\". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film \\"a harrowing Holocaust tale, but one that speaks to humankind's capacity to endure, to fight on in the face of terrible cruelty\\", adding that Holland \\"elicits taut performances from a strong cast\\". David Denby of The New Yorker called it \\"the most volatile that Holland has directed. With a distinguished, hardworking cast of German and Polish actors\\", noting that \\"honesty is the movie's greatest strength\\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said this \\"harrowing, engrossing, claustrophobic and sometimes literally hard to watch [‚Ä¶] robust, arduous drama is more ironic and multi-faceted than most such tales and should be well received by the considerable art house audience worldwide partial to the subject matter\\". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said this \\"brave epic\\" film's \\"suspense, derived from a true story, is excruciating and inspiring in equal measure\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called In Darkness \\"suspenseful, horrifying and at times intensely moving [‚Ä¶] touching, warm and dramatically satisfying\\". On the other hand, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times dismissed the film as redundant and inferior to Schindler's List which was \\"more entertaining\\" in his view. Michael Atkinson of the Village Voice claimed that \\"Holland does skirt the ethical entrapment of Schindler's List (over-lionizing the Aryan rescuer)\\", adding: \\"It's not fair, but there it is: We've been here before.\\" The German authorities in occupied Poland referred to non-Jews, including Poles, as Aryans; colloquially, documents proving one's non-Jewish identity were called \\"Aryan papers\\", and the areas prohibited to Jews were known collectively as \\"the Aryan side\\".Gunnar S. Paulsson, Secret City: The hidden Jews of Warsaw 1940-1945 (Yale 2002) the Polish districts of citi David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote: \\"In outline, In Darkness is a standard conversion melodrama, but little within those parameters is easy. The darkness lingers into the light.\\" Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"an extraordinary movie, and somehow good art [‚Ä¶] a gripping piece of history and also an exploration into the mysteries of the human soul\\", and gave it \\"the highest recommendation\\". = Awards = In Darkness was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards. Nominated alongside the official Canadian nominee Monsieur Lazhar, it attracted attention in the country for marking the first time in the history of Cinema of Canada that had its two films nominated for the best foreign language film Oscar in the same year.

She was concerned particularly with standards of education. Early life Louisa Gurney, born on 25 September 1784, was the seventh of the eleven children of John Gurney (1749‚Äì1809) of Earlham Hall near Norwich, a Quaker, and of Catherine Bell (1754‚Äì1792). Her father inherited ownership of Gurney's Bank in Norwich. Her siblings included Elizabeth Fry, prison reformer, Joseph John Gurney (1788‚Äì1847) and Samuel Gurney (1786‚Äì1856), philanthropists, and Daniel Gurney (1791‚Äì1880), banker and antiquary. They were educated privately, at first by their mother and then by Catherine Bell Gurney, the eldest sister, according to her mother's precepts. The regimen of play, adult conversation and free use of Earlham library was at variance with the Quaker traditions of that period. They were permitted to explore other religions and had both Unitarian and Roman Catholic friends, partly through the Norwich school to which Joseph John was sent, where his sisters also attended some lessons. All the children were encouraged to keep diaries or \\"journals of conscience\\".Blog by Joan Druett, largely a pre√ßis of the ODNB entry. Retrieved 1 October 2012. Louisa's was the most avidly kept. It recorded adolescent enthusiasms for nature, music, and politics, and her aversion to the duller aspects of Quaker observance, and to any unjust treatment of herself or her brothers and sisters. She wrote that she was disgusted when a twelve-year-old second cousin of hers kissed her, but she later married him, the 23-year-old banker Samuel Hoare (1783‚Äì1847) of Hampstead, on 24 December 1806 at Tasborough Meeting House in Norfolk.Note concerning the author (by E. K. P.) in: Mrs. Hoare's Hints on Early Education, 1820 New ed. (London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1905), p. 8. Retrieved 17 January 2013. The marriage was strongly supported by her father-in-law, also Samuel Hoare. According to her sister-in-law, \\"I know of no event which gave my father more pleasure than the engagement of his son to the daughter of his old friend. With perfect confidence in her principles, and a persuasion that she would make my brother happy, he was pleased with her being, like my mother, a Norfolk woman, and interested himself much in procuring for them an house at Hampstead that they might be established near him.\\"Memoirs of Samuel Hoare by his daughter Sarah and his widow Hannah (London: Headley Bros, 1911), p. 32. Bot the husband and the wife were baptised into the Church of England in 1812.Susan Drain: Retrieved 1 October 2011. Subscription required.The Note about the author in the 1905 Hints... states that she was only baptised seven years after her husband, i. e. in 1819. Samuel and Louisa were the parents of John Gurney Hoare and their descendants included the politicians Sir Samuel Hoare, 1st Baronet, and Sir Samuel John Gurney Hoare, 2nd Baronet (later Viscount Templewood). Causes and ideas Louisa came to be considered by her family as the most talented of the brothers and sisters. She contributed to several of their causes: the anti-slavery campaign of her brother-in-law Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, and the prison reform movement of her sister Elizabeth Fry and her own husband. However, her main concern became education. Her Hints for the Improvement of Early Education and Nursery Discipline (1819) was originally written for the nursemaid (nanny) to the first of her six children. \\"Good education,\\" she wrote in the introduction, \\"must be the result of one consistent and connected system.\\"7th e. (London: Hatchard, 1831), p. 4. Retrieved 17 January 2013. The book continued to sell well for eighty years. Her experience was enriched by family tradition and by the influences of 18th- and 19th-century authorities such as John Locke, Fran√ßois F√©nelon, John Foster, Thomas Babington, and Philip Doddridge, and contemporaries of hers such as Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More. Hoare's second book, Friendly Advice on the Management and Education of Children, Addressed to Parents of the Middle and Labouring Classes of Society (1824), was intended to supplement school learning. Its message that discipline should \\"preserve children from evil, not from childishness\\" foreshadows affirmative views of childhood that would gain strength in the Victorian era. Parents, she pointed out, should respect their children and treat them justly, understanding that they, too, have rights. Most importantly, parents should set a good example, for their children would imitate their speech and actions. In 1825 she co-founded the Ladies' Society for Promoting Education in the West Indies, which was supported by other members of the Hoare, Gurney, Buxton and Ricardo families. Her final work was a slim book called Letters from a Work-House Boy (1826). This was several times reprinted by the Religious Tract Society. Louisa Hoare died in Hampstead on 6 September 1836. One of her six children,Elizabeth (died 1902), Catherine Louisa (died 1844), Samuel (1807‚Äì1833), John Gurney (1810‚Äì1875), Edward (1812‚Äì1894), Joseph (1814‚Äì1885), Richard (1824‚Äì1901), and Francis (1828‚Äì1903).

Gelatt said that he wrote the film to be a small production so that he wouldn't be overwhelmed on his first project. The film was shot in Verona, New Jersey, in producer Will Battersby's house. Influences included Nick Cave's Murder Ballads and Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood. The film was designed not to be hostile to religion but critical of aspects. Chando was cast due to her ability to portray character Gloria's sullen disposition using few spoken lines. In other to get into the character, Gelatt provided Chando with dark, atmospheric music, such as Nine Inch Nails and The Cure.  Release  The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and played theatrically in Los Angeles on May 13, 2011, after being released on video on demand on April 20, 2011.

Dennis Harvey of Variety described it as \\"not especially scary\\" but \\"nonetheless compelling\\".

John Marrone of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Bleeding House trades in the traditional horror aspects for a rich story played out by quality acting\\". Paul Nicholasi of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \\"an unflinching piece of American horror\\" that uses black humor to punish \\"a cast filled with vanilla characters ripe for the knife.\\" Terek Puckett of Shock Till You Drop wrote that the film is neither creepy nor suspenseful. Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"There are a couple of plot wholes here and a couple of logic gaps, but if you appreciate a bit of a slow burn before it all hits the fan and you like character driven horror mixed in with your grue, give this one a chance - you'll like what you find.\\" Darryl Loomis of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"For his first film, Gelatt doesn't feature a ton of style in The Bleeding House, but it's a solid economical production that makes me believe he has some talent.\\" Patrick Breen won Best Male Lead at the South African HorrorFest.

He served as Patriarch of Alexandria from 1899 to 1908 when he resigned. Kyrillos Makarios was born in Scenaineh in 1867 and was ordained a priest in 1891. He was appointed as Apostolic Vicar of the Coptic Catholic Church on 15 March 1895 and was appointed as Titular Archbishop of Caesarea Philippi and ordained on the position on 17 April 1895. He headed a Coptic Catholic delegation in September 1895 to the Vatican to meet with Pope Leo XIII after the latter's encyclical dated 11 June 1895 to the Egyptian Catholic Church followers. The delegation requested the reinstatement of the seat of the Coptic Catholic Patriarchate. The papal decision followed quickly on 26 November 1895 reestablishing the patriarchal seat, assigning two eparchies, namely The Eparchy of Hermopolis (El Minia) to be headed by Bishop Maximus Sedfawi and Eparchy of Taybeh (Luxor) to be headed by Bishop Ignatius Barazi, and confirmed Kyrillos Makarios as Apostolic Vicar. In 1898, he held the First Alexandria Council for the Catholic Copts heading as vicar. He served as Vicar until 19 June 1899 when he was appointed as Patriarch of Alexandria as the first patriarch of the reinstated Coptic Catholic Patriarchate and was officially ordained as Patriarch in July 1899 and was instrumental in organizing the dioceses and the churches. His successes however prompted much opposition, upon which he tended his resignation from the seat and retreated to Beirut, Lebanon. After his resignation, the Patriarchal seat remained vacant from 1908 until 1947. During this period, Maximos Sedfaoui served as locum tenens of the Coptic Catholic Church (1908‚Äì1925) with Kyrillos Makarios remaining as Patriarch Emeritus (a titular position) until his death on 18 May 1921. After the death of Sedfaoui, Markos Khouzam became locum tenens of the Coptic Catholic Church (1927‚Äì1947) until his ordainment as Patriarch of Alexandria Markos II Khouzam in 1947.

He was selected in the fourth round of the 2002 NFL Draft by the Tennessee Titans. He played collegiately for the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. At Wisconsin, he was a four‚Äìyear starter at cornerback. He finished his career with a recovered fumble and 12 interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. Before his junior season in 2000, he was suspended one game for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. After the season, he was given second‚Äìteam All‚ÄìBig Ten Conference honors. In 2002, after graduating from Wisconsin, he declared for the NFL Draft. He was drafted by the Titans and debuted later that season. However, after four weeks, he injured his leg and missed the rest of the season. The following season, he saw limited action before being released by the team in 2004. After his stint with the Titans ended, he spent time with the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions, failing to appear in a game for any of the teams. In 2006, Echols played his final professional game for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL, intercepting a pass in his only game for the team. Early years Echols was born on October 13, 1978 in Youngstown, Ohio. He has type 1 diabetes and requires the use of insulin. He attended Ursuline High School in Youngstown, where he was named third‚Äìteam All‚ÄìState. In his senior season, he recorded ten interceptions. He also played wide receiver for the football team, recording 25 receptions for 558 yards in his career. A member of the basketball team, he was a freshman when the team won the state title. As a freshman at Wisconsin in 1997, Echols was redshirted, but in 1998, he entered week one of the season as a starting cornerback opposite fellow redshirt freshman Jamar Fletcher. Against Purdue on October 11, he intercepted quarterback Drew Brees in the end zone, ending their first drive of the game. Wisconsin won 31‚Äì24. He finished the season with three interceptions. In 1999, he started the season off poorly, being beat for touchdowns often; however, as the season progressed, his performances improved. During the season, he intercepted just one pass. Before his junior season in 2000, Echols and 25 of his teammates were suspended for the start of the season by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. He served his one-game suspension during week two of the season, in which Wisconsin won 27‚Äì23 against Oregon. On November 4, against Minnesota, he intercepted a pass and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season with five total interceptions, as well as a fumble recovery. Echols also set a school record with 25 pass deflections. He was named second‚Äìteam All‚ÄìBig Ten Conference for his performances that season. Entering 2001, Echols became the only returning member of Wisconsin's secondary after the other players either graduated or declared for the 2001 NFL Draft. In an interview about the team, secondary coach Todd Bradford said that Echols, \\"is probably as good a tackling defensive back as there is in the country.\\" On September 27, after Wisconsin lost to Oregon early in the month, Oregon's quarterback Joey Harrington, in a diary for ESPN.com, stated that Echols, \\"is one of the best corners I have ever played against. He was very impressive.\\" He finished his senior season at Wisconsin with three interceptions. He graduated in 2002 with a degree in behavioral science and law. Professional career =Tennessee Titans= Prior to the 2002 NFL Draft, Echols was considered to be the 14th-best cornerback in the draft class and was projected to go in either the fourth or fifth round by NFLDraftScout.com. Leading up to the draft, Pete Prisco of CBS Sports wrote that Echols, \\"isn't that big, but he can sure run.\\" He also listed him as being a player that teams were underrating heading into the draft. On the second day of the draft, Echols was selected with the 12th pick of the fourth round by the Tennessee Titans. On July 15, he signed a rookie contract with the Titans. However, on July 26, he was placed on the active/physically unable to perform list by the Titans. He made his debut with the Titans in week one against the Philadelphia Eagles. He recorded three tackles in the game. In week three, against the Cleveland Browns, Echols allowed the game‚Äìwinning eight‚Äìyard touchdown to Browns wide receiver Dennis Northcutt. In the Titans' week four game against the Oakland Raiders, he suffered a leg injury and did not play another game for the rest of the season. He underwent surgery on his left tibia in December. He finished the season with 24 tackles in four games. The following season, he played sparingly, appearing in just five games and recording just eight tackles. His season debut came in week six against the Houston Texans, in which he recorded no tackles. Against both the Jacksonville Jaguars and Miami Dolphins, he recorded three tackles. In the 2004 preseason, after starting cornerback Samari Rolle injured his ankle, Echols started at right cornerback for the Titans. On August 30, against the Dallas Cowboys, he gave up 35-yard pass interference penalty, leading to the Cowboys' Billy Cundiff making a field goal to end the first half of the game. Despite starting, he was considered a candidate to be traded at the end of training camp, only to be released on September 14. =Later career= On September 20, 2004, Echols was signed to the practice squad of the Indianapolis Colts. In early October, he was signed off the Colts' practice squad by the Atlanta Falcons, but was waived on October 26 without making an appearance for Atlanta. The Colts re-signed him to their practice squad three days later. He was later promoted from the practice squad, only to be waived. On December 16, was signed to the Minnesota Vikings' practice squad. The Detroit Lions then signed him off the Vikings' practice squad on December 22. After becoming a restricted free agent at season's end, he re-signed with the Lions on April 14, 2005. He made the 53-man roster out of training camp, but was waived on October 13. After his release by the Titans, he never appeared in another NFL game, despite being on the active roster for nine games in 2004. He finished his NFL career with 32 tackles in nine games, all of which came with Tennessee. On July 4, 2006, he signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. In his debut with Hamilton on July 21, he intercepted a pass from Montreal Alouettes quarterback Anthony Calvillo and returned it 94 yards for a touchdown.

It is the least populated of the city's zones and one of the smallest by area, a significant part of which is occupied by the Piazza del Duomo, the Castello Sforzesco and Sempione Park or Viale Beatrice d'Este. Much of the remainder of the zone is dedicated to museums and administration buildings. Subdivision The zone includes the following quarters: *Brera, which houses the Brera Academy of Fine Arts and the Brera Art Gallery, which prominently contributed to the development of Brera as an artists' neighborhood and a place of bohemian atmosphere, sometimes referred to as \\"the milanese Montmartre\\".Fiori Chiari (one of the best known streets in Brera) Both the Academy and the Gallery are located in Palazzo Brera, the main historical building of the area; this same building also houses Milan's botanical garden as well as an astronomical observatory and the Braidense National Library. Other features that contribute to the character of Brera include restaurants, bars, night clubs, antique and art shops, colorful street markets, as well as fortune tellers' booths; * Viale Beatrice d'Este, tree-lined historic large boulevard avenue that surrounds the city of Milan that also includes viale Luigi Majno, viale Regina Margherita, viale Bianca Maria, bastioni di Porta Venezia, with renowned monuments such as Walls of Milan or design palaces of the 1950s; *Porta Sempione, a prominent historic district that also includes part of Corso Sempione, a large avenue leading to Porta Sempione from the northwest. The main landmark of this area is the Sforza Castle, which dominates the Simplon Park, the largest and most important city park in the centre of Milan. The park houses other renowned monuments and places of interest, such as the Branca Tower, the Palazzo dell'Arte (one of the seats of the Triennale art expo), sculptures by Giorgio de Chirico, and the public aquarium. The whole area is one of the centres of the so-called Milanese movida (night life), with a number of bars, pubs, restaurants, and discos; since the RAI public television company, as well as some major radio stations, have their headquarters in the area, frequent appearances of celebrities contribute to the popularity of the Sempione's night life venues;Il camper del Corriere al Sempione *Porta Tenaglia; *Centro Storico; *Porta Ticinese *Conca del Naviglio; *Guastalla. Education Cloister of the main building of the University of Milan. The courtyard of the Brera Academy. Thanks to its central position, the Zona 1 houses some prominent educational institutions. In this area there are the main buildings of two universities: *University of Milan, founded in 1924, is located not so far from the Piazza del Duomo. At the end of the Second World War, the old Ospedale dei Poveri (Hospital for the Poor) building, known as \\"la C√† Granda\\" (the Big House), was assigned to the University. The building, one of the first Italian examples of civil architecture - commissioned in the 15th century by the Sforza family, the dukes of Milan - was seriously damaged by the bombings of 1943. In 1958, after a complex series of reconstruction and renovation works, it became home to the University Rector's Office, the administrative offices and the schools of Law and Humanities. *Brera Academy of Fine Arts, founded in 1776 by Maria Theresa of Austria, is located in the Brera district. It shared premises with other cultural and scientific institutions ‚Äì the astronomical observatory, the Orto Botanico di Brera, the Scuole Palatine for philosophy and law, the Gymnasium, laboratories for physics and chemistry, the Biblioteca di Brera, the agricultural society and, from 1806, the Pinacoteca di Brera or art gallery.

I am not normally prone to bursts of enthusiasm. Awestruck by the evidence, however, I recognise the magnificence of an art that is strange, troubling, provocative in respect of time and surroundings, the idea of perfection unusual in a world that cultivates the ephemeral, superficiality, imposture and financial success. (N.b. Henry Mavrodin does not sell his art insofar as it is experienced as an intimate dialogue with destiny or God, whoever he might be.) Knowing the morality of artists, I know that he will be hated for his limited, shining, long-lasting glory. For a great artist, I was once told by the eminent art historian Eugenio Riccomini, who dedicated a monograph in Italy to our painter and was kind enough to open the exhibition in Bucharest, enemies are important. Henry Mavrodin is a bizarre alloy of pride and humility: natural pride in the creative professions (only public servants and others of their kind have a claim on mediocrity), and equally natural humility towards the great landmarks in the history of art, which he fatally dreams of achieving and equalling. He shows a sacred respect for the great European painting of centuries past and sees himself as a happy prisoner of its emotional space, most likely for a number of fundamental reasons: spiritual harmony, the need for meaning, the urgent need for philosophical inquiry, the possibility of probing the sublime complexities of technique. Those who reject improvisation, rapid and cheap recognition, seem to have no other path to choose. (...) We contemplate calmly a picture which demands our attention insatiably, melancholically, imploringly, aggressively, like mute suffering condemned to silence and strictly visual confession. The colours appear to have been invented by providence, they submit to reason and intuition alike in proportions that are implacable and, therefore, perfect. The objects have a secret life. The faces at times take on the appearance of masks; the landscapes, the compositions wrestle with their volumetric reality, inevitably crucified in bidimensionality. Their refined ambiguity attempts to combine in pure visuality material consistency and its ghost, the mental reading of an image in perspective and the concreteness of the geometrical plane of the canvas surface. Henry Mavrodin is a soul trapped between two worlds. One of his works can take a year to complete, as recorded scrupulously at the bottom of the work like a tally. The fast-paced world of today has thrown him out and into the heart of eternal art. His admirers will be rare but of a high quality. He is the final firework display in the amazing adventure of painting which began centuries ago, says professor Eugenio Riccomini. His room for manoeuvre appears to be limited. It is not. Between the memory of great past values and the contemporary world, which is incapable of establishing its own values, our painter, so extravagant with time, stubbornly and miserly saves up death in life, and installs himself comfortably as occupying an uninhabited plot of land. He fills empty space and treats wounds that continue to bleed under the surface, following in his master's footsteps, whose unusual portrait he worked on for seven years, and from which he learned that art does not march with the regiment, but consumes itself in sweet and sour solitude.Radu Cornel Constantinescu - AdevƒÉrul, 17.10.1998, on the exhibition H.M. the National Art Museum of Romania/ Cornel Radu Constantinescu Cornel Radu Constantinescu ‚Äì AdevƒÉrul, 17.10.1998, referitor la expozi≈£ia H.M. de la Muzeul Na≈£ional de ArtƒÉ al Rom√¢niei Radu Cornel Constantinescu Mavrodin is an exceptional vis-a vis the distinctive characteristics of contemporary Romanian painting, being an example of independence from the current trends, or to be more precise, the latest fashions in art today. He is a painter that loves solitude and calm, and to find these he took refuge in a corner of the island of Murano, that is in a place particularly favourable to viewing and reviewing the inner side of the pictures of his own dreams. For the paintings of Mavrodin are composed of dreams from outside time, reconstructed in the space of the painting, with the technical authority worthy of an old Fleming (‚Ä¶) Among the multiple aspects of the multiple revival of figurative realism, the magical evocations of Mavrodin‚Äôs painting deserve to be considered in a light of their own for their solitude and the quality of the authentic poetic vocation.

The first body to publicly articulate dissatisfaction with the Union since the Highland Potato Famine and the nationalist revolts in mainland Europe during the 1840s, it was closely associated with the Tories and was motivated by a desire to secure more focus on Scottish problems in response to what they felt was undue attention being focused on Ireland by the then Liberal government. The short-lived body attracted few notable figures and was wound up in 1856. The Association claimed that Ireland received more generous treatment than Scotland. It argued that the United Kingdom should always be designated 'Great Britain' and that Scotland ought to send more MPs to Westminster. These were relatively minor issues, and presented no serious challenge to the Establishment. Nevertheless, the Association was an important preliminary step in the campaign for Scottish Home Rule. Public supporters of the movement included Lord Eglinton, who moved a petition on behalf of the Association in the House of Lords in April 1854, and Professor William Aytoun of the University of Edinburgh.

Geography With an area of , it is Thailand's second largest national park. Thap Lan's headquarters is in Bu Phram, Na Di, Prachinburi Province. It encompasses Bu Phram Subdistrict, Na Di District, Prachinburi; Pak Thong Chai District, Wang Nam Khiao District, Khon Buri District, and Soeng Sang District of Nakhon Ratchasima Province; and Pakham District of Buriram Province. The highest peak is high Khao Lamang. The terrain includes mountain ranges, valleys, chasms, and waterfalls. Climate Thap Lan has three seasons, with a mean annual temperature of 28 ¬∞C. The rainy season extends from May to October, when it rains most days. The wettest month is October. In the rainy season around 269 mm of rain falls at Thap Lan. The cold season is from November to February. The coolest month is December, with an average daily maximum of 24 ¬∞C. The hot season is March and April, when temperatures can reach 31 ¬∞C. Flora Most of Thap Lan is covered in dry evergreen forest, particularly on lower mountain slopes. There are a number of important plant species found within this forest type, including Dipterocarps and Hopia. Bamboo is also often found in drier forests. Near Ban Thap Lan, Ban Khun Sri Bupram, and Ban Wang Mued, are rare fan palm or Talipot palm forests. These forests covered much of the northeast region of Thailand in the past, though the spread of agriculture saw the destruction of a large number of palm forests. Today, Thap Lan is home to one of the few such forests remaining in Thailand. The fan palm is important in Thai culture as its leaves were used as the parchment on which Buddhist texts were inscribed. Fan palms are an ancient plant that produce a single massive inflorescence, the largest in the plant kingdom, containing up to 60 million flowers. After this huge exertion of energy, the tree dies. Fauna As Thap Lan National Park covers such a large area, and is connected to Khao Yai, Pang Sida, and Ta Praya National Parks, it is home to a number of wild animals, including tigers, elephants, buffaloes, bangtang, serow, black bears, sun bears, crown gibbons, hornbills, pheasants, and lorikeets. According to researchers, the park may have more tigers than China. A total of 149 bird species have been confirmed within the park, including several rare species restricted to low-land evergreen forest, such as the green imperial pigeon, stork-billed kingfisher, scaly-crowned babbler, Collared kingfisher and Jerdon's baza. In dense forest near water are Green dragontail butterflies. There is hope that one of the world's most endangered mammals, the kouprey, may still survive in Thap Lan and Pang Sida National Parks. Though one has not been sighted within Thailand for more than 30 years, this primitive cattle species could provide genes valuable in the production of disease-free strains of domestic cattle. Conservation Queen Sirikit's Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex includes Thap Lan and five other related areas: Khao Yai National Park, Pang Sida National Park, Ta Phraya National Park, Phra Phuttha Chai National Park, and Dongyai Wildlife Sanctuary. While elephant hunting is common in the Dangrek Range, elephants are better protected in Thap Lan. Illegal encroachments on park boundaries have been an unsolved problem in Thap Lan National Park for almost 40 years. In May 2012, a resort was charged with forest encroachment when three illegal buildings were found on 20 rai of park land. In 2017, a second raid was conducted at the same resort. It was found to have illegally occupied 34 rai with 18 buildings. Prosecutors in November 2018 declined to indict the resort's operator for encroachment, leading the Bangkok Post to warn that, \\"As long as the DNP [Department of National Parks] continues to issue 'demolition orders' against luxury resorts without following through on the threat, the problem will remain unsolved.\\" References Category:National parks of Thailand Category:Protected areas established in 1981 Category:Geography of Nakhon Ratchasima Province Category:Tourist attractions in Nakhon Ratchasima Province Category:Geography of Prachinburi Province Category:Tourist attractions in Prachinburi Province Category:1981 establishments in Thailand Category:Sankamphaeng Range ","title":"Thap Lan National Park"},{"id":"33271365","text":"Robert Wallis was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1597 and 1611.

Needless to say, they are wholeheartedly despised by criminals. Each Drood is entrusted with a golden (and, for some time, silver) torc, which bestows a certain \\"living armour\\" upon the wearer, giving them nearly unlimited strength, speed, durability and stealth, which can be called up or dispelled at will. The torc also grants the wearer the Sight, allowing him to see through most magical and scientific disguises, translates any language, prevents the user from appearing in any kind of photography, videotaping, or tracking of any kind (including tracking by other Droods), prevents the user's soul from being taken away (by daemons or other creatures of the sort), and a whole host of other abilities. Edwin (he is usually referred to as \\"Eddie\\") is a field agent of the Droods who operates in the London area. During his early childhood in the Hall, the Droods' base of operations, Eddie came to hate the family due to its strict discipline and the lack of freedom given to him. At some point, the Matriarch agreed with Eddie to have him leave the Hall and base his operations outside of it. He still owed allegiance to the family and did missions for them, but was able to avoid living in the Hall and thus had much more freedom in his living. The series acts as a framing story of sorts, with references to characters and settings within the Nightside, Hawk and Fisher, and Deathstalker stories; Giles Deathstalker plays a prominent role in the second book, Nightside agent Walker plays a large part in the third, and throughout the series many Nightside characters (e.g. Merlin Satanspawn, Leo Morn, Harry Fabulous, Janissary Jane, and even Nightside protagonist John Taylor) are referenced or appear briefly. Simon R. Green stated that Night Fall is the final novel in the series, and features the first meeting between John Taylor and Eddie Drood, culminating in a Drood invasion of the Nightside.

He owned an estate on Krestovsky Island, where, in 1908, Nicolai, the brother of Felix Yusupov was killed in a duel with a jealous husband. During World War I, he commanded the 2nd Guards Cavalry Division and the 3rd Don Cavalry Division. From 1915 he served on the Caucasus front under General Nikolai Baratov. On January 1, 1917, the body of Grigory Rasputin was found in the Malaya Neva near Bolshoy Petrovsky Bridge. In 1917, he joined the white movement and served on the staff of White Finnish leader, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim during the Russian Civil War. He was subsequently a staff officer in the North Western Army of General Yudenich. After the end of the Civil War Prince Sergei settled in England and died in Tonbridge, where he befriended Denton Welch, in 1951. Prince Sergei was a keen sportsman. He was one of the founders of the St Petersburg Sports Club and was Russian representative on the International Olympic Committee between 1900 and 1908. Personal life In 1894, Prince Sergei married Susan Tucker Whittier (1874‚Äì1934), daughter of Charles A. Whittier of Boston. Together, Sergei and Susan were the parents of two children: * Sergei Sergeivich Belosselsky- Belozersky (1895‚Äì1978), who married Florence Crane Robinson (1890‚Äì1969), the former wife of William Albert Robinson and daughter of Richard Teller Crane, in 1943. * Andrei Sergeivich Belosselsky-Belozersky (1909‚Äì1961), a bachelor who was head of the \\"incoming news section\\" of the BBC.

He began his studies in astronomy at the University of Bonn, but switched to mathematics when his poor eyesight made taking astronomical observations impossible. He received his doctorate in 1865 from Heidelberg University, for a thesis on Pascal's theorem. Following up on Carl Friedrich Gauss' work on statistics, L√ºroth discovered the t-distribution usually credited to William Sealy Gosset. In modern terms, the calculation that led L√ºroth to the t-distribution was the computation of a Bayesian interval.

There are several significant purposes for measuring gas tension; the most common gas tensions measured are oxygen tension (PxO2), the carbon dioxide tension (PxCO2) and carbon monoxide tension (PxCO). The subscript x in each symbol represents the source of the gas being measured; \\"a\\" meaning arterial, \\"A\\" being alveolar, \\"v\\" being venous, \\"c\\" being capillary. Blood gas tests (such as arterial blood gas tests) measure these partial pressures. Oxygen tension ;Arterial blood oxygen tension (normal) PaO2 ‚Äì Partial pressure of oxygen at sea level (160 mmHg in the atmosphere, 21% of standard atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg) in arterial blood is between 75 mmHg and 100 mmHg. ;Venous blood oxygen tension (normal) PvO2 ‚Äì Oxygen tension in venous blood at sea level is between 30 mmHg and 40 mmHg. Carbon dioxide tension Carbon dioxide is a by-product of food metabolism and in high amounts has toxic effects including: dyspnea, acidosis and altered consciousness. ;Arterial blood carbon dioxide tension PaCO2 ‚Äì Partial pressure of carbon dioxide at sea level in arterial blood is between 35 mmHg and 45 mmHg. ;Venous blood carbon dioxide tension PvCO2 ‚Äì Partial pressure of carbon dioxide at sea level in venous blood is between 40 mmHg and 50 mmHg.

Early life Henry D'Urban Keary was born on 28 April 1857, the fourth son of William Keary, the manager and agent of the Holkham Hall estate in Norfolk, and his wife Anna (n√©e Anna D'Urban Rodwell).Wade Martins (2004). The mother's name is given as Helen, not Anna, in Who Was Who. He was educated at Marlborough College before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst; on passing out from Sandhurst in 1876, he was commissioned into the 2nd Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment as a second lieutenant. Later the same year, he was transferred to the Staff Corps and posted to India, where he took up a commission in the 1st Madras Native Infantry.Who Was Who Indian service Keary was promoted to Lieutenant shortly after his arrival, in 1877, and served with his regiment in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1879-8 and the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885. From 1887 to 1892, with a promotion to Captain, he raised and then commanded a battalion of military police in Burma, as part of the operations to secure British control in the newly annexed country. During this time, he was involved in the operations against Wuntho in 1891, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order as well as being mentioned in despatches. In 1892, he was given a brevet promotion to Major and appointed to command the 31st Madras Light Infantry, which was involved in suppressing a rebellion in the northern Chin Hills in 1892-93. It later served in China (renamed the 31st Burma Light Infantry) as part of the Western relief force during the Boxer Rebellion, where Keary was again mentioned in despatches. His brevet promotion was confirmed in 1897, and he was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in 1903 and Colonel in 1906. He relinquished command of the regiment (now named as the 91st Punjabis) in 1909, when he was appointed to command the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the 9th (Secunderabad) Division; in 1910, he transferred to the Garhwal Brigade of 7th (Meerut) Division. From 1907 to 1912 he served as an aide-de-camp to the King, and in 1911, he was promoted to Major-General and made a Companion of the Bath. First World War Keary was in command of the Garhwal Brigade at the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, when it was mobilised for service in France as part of the Meerut Division. The brigade had one British battalion (the 2nd Leicestershire Regiment) and three Indian (the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 39th Garhwal Rifles, and the 2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles). It sailed for France in September, and was disembarking in Marseilles by 11 October, moving to the Western Front by the end of the month.Willcocks (1920), pp. 19-20, 27 He commanded the brigade during its first months on the Western Front with \\"good initiative and tactical judgment\\", leading to his promotion to take command of the 3rd (Lahore) Division in January 1915. At the Second Battle of Ypres that year he commanded the division in a series of unsuccessful counter-attacks. The division was withdrawn from the front line in November 1915,Willcocks (1920), p. 343 and after resting in France arrived in the Mesopotamian theatre in April 1916. Keary was promoted to Lieutenant- General in 1917, and given command of the 7th Meerut Divisional Area in India in October 1917.

The Law Courts building occupies the southern block of the three city block complex, provincial government offices the middle block, and the Vancouver Art Gallery the northern block. The building is used exclusively by the two higher courts of the Province of British Columbia: the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. Background The project began as The British Columbia Centre, a provincial government project to replace the neo-Classical courthouse forming the northern of the three Robson Square blocks which now houses the Vancouver Art Gallery. The proposed 50-storey tower, at 208 metres (682 feet), would have been the tallest skyscraper in the city (and taller than the Living Shangri-La, which holds the record as of 2011). In 1972 the provincial government of WAC Bennett was defeated by the NDP government of Dave Barrett.

After his retirement in 1979, Holt remained active in work related to the International Whaling Commission and conservation of whales in general, also publishing his views about whaling and fisheries management in academic journals. Achievements Much of the foundations of quantitative fisheries science were laid out in the book On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations which Beverton and Holt wrote at the Fisheries Laboratory in Lowestoft (UK). In his review of the 1993 reprint of the book, Ray Hilborn writes \\"It is remarkable how the book has stood the test of time and still provides a survey of the important topics in fisheries management.\\" The book was reprinted in 2004 with a new foreword by Holt.

(Ed) (2008) Advances in Fisheries Science: 50 years on from Beverton and Holt, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK. The volume includes a foreword by Holt. Outside fisheries science, Holt is best known for the Beverton‚ÄìHolt model. In population ecology the model is used as a stand-alone discrete time population model or as a model of density dependence in larger population models. Originally the model had a more specific usage; it was devised to describe the dependence of recruitment on spawning stock biomass. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) and The Committee of Three Holt worked on the International Whaling Commission's panel termed The Committee of Three that found new methods to calculate whaling quotas. The group analyzed whaling data (catches, the number of whaling boats etc.) to come up with proposals for annual quotas for whales. The panel's report, in 1961, was the international whaling commission's first attempt to come up with quotas that would permit whaling while allowing the whale population to increase. The three scientists on the panel (Kenneth Radway Allen, Douglas G. Chapman and Holt) were selected because they specialized in fisheries research but were not officially connected with Norway, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Japan or Britain, the countries conducting the whaling they were to study. The quotas recommended were so much lower than usual that the whaling countries argued over them for many years but eventually they had to lower the quotas. However the whaling countries first adopted interim, compromise quotas which were higher than recommended.

Below the Serbo-Croatian text, Norwegian is inscribed: \\"This monolith was erected in 1949 in gratitude, by the populaces of Norway and Yugoslavia, in memory of the more than 500 Yugoslavians - victims of Nazism that died in the German Beisfjord camp - 1942-43 - They were faithful to their fatherland and liberty - until death\\" The Beisfjord massacre () was a massacre on 18 July 1942 at Lager I Beisfjord (German for \\"Beisfjord Camp No.1\\", ) in Beisfjord, Norway of 288 political prisoners. The massacre had been ordered a few days earlier by the Reichskommissar for Norway Josef Terboven. Background In order to build defences in Norway against the Allies, the Germans brought in around 5,000 Yugoslavian political prisoners and prisoners-of-war‚Äîin addition to prisoners of other nationalities‚Äîto work as forced labour on infrastructure projects. In the summer of 1942 a number of prisoners started arriving in North Norway as a result of the transfer of prisoners from the new Croatian puppet regime to German authorities who needed manpower for projects in Norway. This acquisition of manpower for projects in Norway was under Organisation Todt Einsatzgruppe Wiking. In 2013 Dagbladet quoted Knut Flovik Thoresen saying‚Äîin regards to the camps that were to cost the lives of 2,368 Yugoslavs‚Äîthat \\"Norwegian [camp] guards' [in North Norway] gruesome violations against Yugoslav prisoners in Norway during the war, were so cruel that I have hardly ever read about more brutal acts\\". Furthermore, many of the victims were Serbs from the independent state of Croatia (NDH)‚Äînot partisans, but chosen based on ethnicity. In the first deployment of camp guards that were sent to North Norway, some used their bayonets so often \\"that even the Germans had enough of it\\". The second group were not issued bayonets, for fear that they would become as bloodthirsty. (The guards from these groups came from Hirdvaktbataljonen‚Äîa battalion within Hirden, that had the responsibility for guarding the prison camps in North Norway, between June 1942 and April 1943. 500 of these guards served at four main camps‚ÄîLager 1 Beisfjord, Lager 2 Elsfjord, Lager 3 Rognan and Lager 4 Karasjok‚Äîand their satellite prison camps at Korgen, Osen, and at Lake Jernvann on Bj√∏rnfjell.) The number of individuals victimized by SS-kommandant Hermann Dolp and his German and Norwegian subordinates, might total 3,000 or even 4,000. In 2013, Flovik Thoresen said, \\"You can be sure that if Norwegian prisoners had been exposed to similar [atrocities], then many of the perpetrators would have been sentenced to death. Instead most were let off with sentences more lenient than those received by women who served as nurses at the front lines\\". There were 31 camps between Bergen and Hammerfest during World War II. \\"[F]rom June 1942 until March 1943, regularly there were such executions of Yugoslavs [as at Beisfjord and Bj√∏rnfjell ] in Norwegian camps. 27 prisoners were shot at Ulven near Bergen, and 26 were shot in Troms√∏ during a ship's arrival. In both cases, the prisoners were told that the sick were going to hospital. In the Karaskjok camp, [and] in Botn, in Korgen and in the Osen camps, groups of 10 to 50 sick prisoners were removed from the camps and shot. The SS cleaned out the infirmaries in this manner\\", according to the Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities. The involvement of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration was revealed in a 2014 Dagsavisen article: \\"The camps were built by the Public Roads Administration.\\" Furthermore, that the road work was led by the Public Roads Administration, \\"was more the rule, rather than the exception,\\" and the agency's \\"employees were facilitators and witnesses‚Äînot executioners\\". In November 1941 blueprints and descriptions for the construction of the prison camps were sent from the Directorate of Public Roads. Furthermore, in the \\"early stage, we only know of one small protest: the [agency] refused to feed the prisoners. This was done by a lie\\": The agency claimed that it was not common for the agency to feed their road workers. Furthermore, Anders Fagerbakk's dissertation says that Helgoland veikontor‚Äîa local office of the agency‚Äîsent a letter of complaint to Directorate of Public Roads, a few days after Yugoslavians were put to work on road construction: The engineer in charge reported that \\"Norwegian road workers became restless and nervous, as a result of working with the Yugoslavians. The Yugoslavians were being fed starvation rations, and they lacked [enough] clothing\\". In later reporting from the village Karasjok, the description \\"skin and bones\\" was used about Yugoslavian prisoners constructing roads. Furthermore, \\"after the war, everyone in the Public Roads Administration denied involvement with the Yugoslavian prisoners.\\" Reactions to the involvement of the agency, include (in 2014) \\"Still, no one has asked: Could they have stopped the mass murders?\\" \\"That the Public Roads Administration were early out to accept the use POWs on the agency's construction projects, opened for others‚Äîsuch as the State Railways‚Äîto flag their interest for this controversial manpower\\", according to a 2015 Klassekampen article. \\"As many as 150 000 foreign POWs, political prisoners and forced laborers were in Norway between 1941 and 1945. Over 13 700 died. The majority performed heavy labour construction work on Nordland Line, Highway 50 ([present-day] E6 ) thru North Norway, fortifications and airports.\\" The largest group of prisoners were Soviets, followed by Poles and Yugoslavs. The Yugoslavs worked on the following roads: the \\"Blood Road‚ÄîBlodveien‚Äîfrom Rognan to Langs√∏let, Elsfjord‚ÄîKorgen, on the Bj√∏rnefjell Road towards Kiruna and on the road between Karasjok and the Finnish Border\\". \\"The Germans prioritized access to iron ore mines in Kiruna and the nickel mines in Petsamo\\", rather than following plans of the NPRA. The massacre On 24 June 1942, 900 Yugoslavian prisoners arrived at the Fagernes Pier in Narvik. \\"They start to walk the ten kilometer long road to Beisfjord\\" (...) Five prisoners are hit, and die along the road, and one is shot and killed\\" before the prisoners arrive at the location where a prison camp was established. On 12 July 1942 \\"some German officers, a German- and a Norwegian physician came for an inspection of the camp\\" (...) The SS officers' suspicion of typhoid fever was confirmed by this [Norwegian] MD. Typhoid fever must be diagnosed thru blood- or stool samples. (...) The physical symptoms that the prisoners had, concurred, but neither the Norwegian- or German MD took blood tests. The Norwegian MD picked out 85 prisoners who allegedly had typhoid fever. He supposedly did not examine them thoroughly, but [he] picked out the prisoners from a distance because they looked frail. They were immediately sent to the infirmary\\". The Beisfjord camp was quarantined by the SS on 15 July 1942 allegedly to avoid an outbreak of typhus. According to Ljubo Mladjenovic (a former prisoner) in his 1989 book, conditions at the camp were unhealthy and there was an outbreak of typhus.Mladjenovic Prisoners with various illnesses were moved into two barracks, which became surrounded by barbed wire. On the evening of July 17, the 588 \\"prisoners regarded as healthy\\" were marched out of the camp by nearly all of the Norwegian guards and some German superiors. =After prisoners regarded as healthy were marched out of the Beisfjord camp= The remaining \\"weak and exhausted\\" prisoners (in Beisfjord) were ordered to dig graves and then ordered into standing positions where they would drop into the grave after the guards had shot them. These 288 prisoners were killed in groups of twenty. Those prisoners who could not stand on their own feet, were left in the two barracks ‚Äî which were then doused in gasoline and set on fire. Some sources say that a number of prisoners refused to leave the infirmary, and the building was set ablaze; those who jumped out of the windows were shot. Those who tried to escape the conflagration, were shot by a machine gun in the watch tower. Seventeen Norwegian guards were present and played a role during the massacre. (The guard staff of the camp consisted of around 150 men from Ordnungspolizei‚Äîcontrolled by the SS‚Äîand around 50 Norwegian guards\\" who were volunteers.) Killings at Bj√∏rnfjell On the evening of July 17, the 588 \\"prisoners regarded as healthy\\" were marched out of the Beisfjord Camp by nearly all of the Norwegian guards and some German superiors. Their destination was north-east ‚Äî Bj√∏rnefjell. At Bj√∏rnfjell they were quarantined, and the camp at √òvre Jernvann was established. \\"On 22 July, two days after arrival at Bj√∏rnfjell, all the prisoners had to run around the camp six times. Those prisoners who were not able, were shot.\\" 10 prisoners were picked out and shot \\"farther down by the lake\\" [Jernvann]. Runs of this kind were held at other times, resulting in deaths every time. After five weeks on the mountain, 242 prisoners were dead. \\"The last 43 were [those classified as] sick who were shot\\" during the hike back to Beisfjord. Legacy In the spring of 1946 \\"seven of the circa twenty SS officers that worked at the camps at Beisfjord and √òvre Jernvann, were arrested and transported to Beograd\\" (...) Everyone received the death sentence. Also Norwegian guards that had killed or violated prisoners, were arrested after the war and convicted\\", according to HL-senteret. In 1949 a monument in memory of the Yugoslavians [at Beisfjord] was erected. Reactions to the massacre P√•l Nygaard (author and researcher) said that \\"Not long after the war\\" Nils Christie \\"interested himself in the Yugoslavian prisoners. Christie thought that research (en studie) of their prison guards, was the best way we in Norway could gain knowledge and understanding (...) He wanted to dig deeper where others waved off the actions [merely] as evil. In Norway there was little interest in reading- or listening to him. Killings and brutality belonged to the others, the bad: occupants. - Still it is like that\\". A 2015 Dagbladet article was written by Guri Hjeltnes. =Criticism of lack of focus on the involvement of Norwegian paramilitary soldiers= In 2009, Aftenposten wrote \\"That Norwegian pupils are sent on organized bus trips to Germany and Poland to get a sense of the atrocities there, without knowing that equivalent atrocities were committed in Norway, puzzles the leader of Nordnorsk Fredssenter in Narvik\\". Adding \\"That the events [of the massacre] were covered up, is feared by the head of a war museum in Narvik (Nordland R√∏de Kors Krigsminnemuseum),(Site doesn't contain the info) because members of a paramilitary force of Norwegians‚ÄîHirden‚Äî participated in the atrocities\\". In 2010 Fritt Ord sponsored research that has led to an exhibition (from 12 August 2012) at the Falstad Center. =Efraim Zuroff= In 2013 Efraim Zuroff reportedly \\"has eyed the groups of war criminals that he thinks there is reason to still hunt: It concerns soldiers from SS-Division Wiking that amongst other things, participated in massacring Jews on the Eastern Front 70 years ago; soldiers that served in Hirdvaktbataljonen in North Norway and who exposed Serbian POWs for horrific violations; and Norwegians that participated in arrests of Jews during the war. - Many of them were convicted, but not for what they really did\\". The same article said that Norway's Department of Justice had scheduled a meeting with Zuroff on 20 November 2013, but a misunderstanding within the department led to Zuroff not being notified. State Secretary Vidar Brein-Karlsen has said that he will gladly meet with representatives from the Wiesenthal Centre to hear what they have to say.

His mother Agnes Billie was Seminole of the Bird clan; his father was J.W. Barnett, a white sailor who went to Europe during World War II, never knowing that Agnes was pregnant. She named the boy Whookipee, meaning \\"He who has been taken away\\". Shortly after Billie's birth, Seminole medicine men intended to kill the infant by leaving him to die in the Everglades; they intended to do so because he was a \\"half-breed\\" and they strongly discouraged intermarriage with whites. His mother Agnes and Betty Mae Tiger, a young Snake clan woman, intervened and saved his life by threatening to report them to the reservation superintendent.De Groot, \\"James Billie: Born as outcast, leader still very much a man alone\\", Sun Sentinel, 16 February 1986, accessed 17 April 2013 (Tiger and her brother's lives had been threatened in the late 1920s when they were young, as their father was white. Despite being a \\"half-breed\\", under the Seminole matrilineal system, Billie belonged to his mother's Bird clan; he grew up learning the Seminole ways. He was orphaned at the age of nine when his mother died, but the boy was cared for by several families of the Bird clan, with whom he remains very close.Goliath Business News By the age of fourteen, he learned to catch and wrestle alligators in tourist shows to earn money for his family. He was interested in music as a young boy, and later combined many of the sounds he heard in his own melodies and lyrics.Sierra Adare, \\"Sounds of the Seminole Nation\\", News From Indian Country, 15 March 2000, accessed 17 April 2013 He enlisted at age 19 in the United States Army in 1965. He served in specialized units engaged in commando operations in the Vietnam War. Career After his return to Florida, Billie worked in different jobs on the reservation. He was worried about the young people who seemed so discouraged, and started studying more about his heritage, and speaking about the Seminole ways. He built a highly successful business building chickees, mostly for whites who wanted an authentic Seminole tradition. He also became manager of the Seminole Indian Village on the Hollywood reservation. He became involved in tribal politics. He first was elected to the General Council. Elected Chairman of the tribe in 1979, Billie led the tribe through legal challenges to the high-stakes bingo game first proposed by the previous chairman, Howard Tommie. Surviving state challenges, the Tribe established its first site, asserting its right as a sovereign nation to have gambling, at a time when gambling was widely illegal, although some states were beginning to adopt lotteries to raise money. The establishment of gaming operations was an economic engine for the Seminole, and many other tribes followed its example. States struggled to regulate gambling even after the 1988 passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), which established federal rules to regulate it. In 1996 the Seminole Tribe won the US Supreme Court case, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, in which the Court affirmed the tribe's sovereign rights against regulation by the state outside the IGRA.Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida (1996), Law Justia During Florida‚Äôs ‚Äúcocaine cowboy‚Äù days, Billie used his military training to organize a Seminole self-defense force to patrol the Florida Everglades. They hunted down cocaine pilots who used isolated roads in the Seminole Tribe lands as improvised airstrips. That force became the basis for the Seminole Tribe‚Äôs police force, which Billie founded. As revenues to the tribe increased, it constructed a five-story administration building during his tenure. Pleased with the tribe's success during Billie's tenure, the Council raised his annual salary to $330,000. He was the highest-paid elected official in Florida. Billie was impeached by the Seminole Council in 2001 for what they claimed were financial irregularities stemming from sexual misconduct. The St. Petersburg Times ran a series of articles attacking him, and the FBI investigated him for years. The tribe's court case \\"fizzled\\" after he was expelled from the ruling council in 2003 and banned from using the tribe's airplanes, housed at a hangar at Big Cypress Indian Reservation. He sued the Council and that year was awarded $600,000 in damages by the Seminole Tribe. By 2005, a tribal audit showed the Seminole Tribe had taken in $1.1 billion in revenues that year. In 2007, the tribe purchased the Hard Rock Cafe franchise, a worldwide consortium of restaurants, hotels and casinos. In 2011, the Sun Sentinel estimated total revenues taken in by the tribe to be in the billions of dollars and growing.Sun Sentinel, 21 June 2011 In 2011, Billie defeated Mitchell Cypress, the previous two-term chairman, by winning 58.4 percent of the votes for the Chair of the Seminole Tribe. He was ousted as chairman by the Seminole Tribe of Florida in September 2016. =Business= To make a living after leaving the chairmanship, Billie returned to his Jim Billie Seminole Indian Chiki Huts business, building the traditional chickee open houses. He had made this his first business before entering tribal politics. In 2005, Billie was hired as CEO of the Micco Aircraft Company, based in Oklahoma.

History  In older documents the mountain was just called Kuppe or Koppe which means \\"dome-shaped hill\\". When, in 1889, the House of Wettin celebrated its 800th anniversary and numerous festive events were held in the Kingdom of Saxony, the mountain was renamed the Wettinh√∂he (\\"Wetten Heights\\") and a nine-metre-high (), iron observation tower was built on the summit. It was inaugurated on 16 June 1889. Next to the tower a bowery wooden building was erected as a restaurant. The mountain inn was only open in summer. After the business ground to a halt during the First World War, a new building with a massive cellar was built after the war's end that stood until 1933. In that year the mountain guesthouse was demolished at the behest of a customs inspector (Zollkommissar), because inter alia illegal leaflets had been distributed here. After the Second World War the name Wettinh√∂he was discontinued and the mountain was given its current name. In 1952 work began on rebuilding the inn. At the same time the tower was raised by 2 metres. This tower stood until 1995 and was then replaced by a steel design, that was similar to the original tower. The inn has been open again since 1993. It holds evenings of \\"Myths and Magic\\" (Sagen und Magie). Because of the garlic dishes on the menu, the mountain is also known locally as the Knoblauchkuppe (\\"garlic dome\\").  Routes to the summit  There is no direct access for private cars, the nearest option is pay car park by the H√ºttenteich pond in Geising. From there two well-signed hiking trails run to the summit, either along the road or up a steeper, but shorter option uphill from the Anton G√ºnther Stein.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on November 7, 2010. The episode was written by Frank Darabont, the creator of the series, and directed by Michelle MacLaren. In the episode, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) joins a small group of survivors in an attempt to escape Atlanta. Plot Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is able to escape the tank and the swarm of walkers with help from Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), leading them to safety of a department store. Rick meets the other members of Glenn's scavenging group, including Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), a virulent racist, and T-Dog (IronE Singleton), a black man dismayed by Merle's attitude. When Merle attempts to beat up T-Dog and assert control, Rick subdues him and handcuffs him to a pipe on the store's roof. Glenn makes contact with the survivors' camp outside the city, where, unknown to Rick, his friend Shane Walsh, and his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son Carl (Chandler Riggs), are safe. Shane and Lori still believe Rick is dead and have begun a relationship together. As walkers swarm the building, the group finds its escape route through the sewer cut off. Rick spots a box truck nearby they could use to escape. Rick and Glenn cover themselves in the blood and viscera of a dispatched walker to mask their scent from other walkers as they walk through the horde. It soon starts to rain, washing away the walker scent, and Rick and Glenn make a break for the truck. Glenn uses the car alarm on a Dodge Challenger to draw the walkers away, while Rick drives the box truck to the department store's cargo doors. In the rush to escape, T-Dog accidentally drops the handcuff key for Merle down a sewage drain, and they are forced to abandon him; however, T-Dog secures the roof access door with a heavy chain to give Merle some protection. The remaining group travel with Rick back to the survivors' camp, with Glenn following close behind. Production Filming for the episode commenced in several places throughout Atlanta, including the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center. \\"Guts\\" was written by Frank Darabont and directed by Michelle MacLaren. The episode contains a sequence in which the survivors kill and dissect a walker. Rick Grimes and Glenn Rhee agree to find a vehicle to escape from downtown Atlanta and, to avoid attracting the attention of hordes of walkers, wrap entrails around themselves. Filming for the scene commenced at the non-skyscraper part of the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center, depicted as an abandoned Macy's location. (It is in fact the historic former flagship store of Atlanta-based Rich's, closed by Macy's parent company; the actual downtown Macy's was the Davison's store.) Writer Robert Kirkman felt that it \\"very much makes sense in the context of the story\\", and added that the graphic violence had its place within the show. In his interview with Entertainment Weekly, Kirkman explained why the characters covered themselves in the blood and entrails of a walker: > It's not that they can smell better, it's just that they're used to a > general smell of deadness, as they're moving around in groups. And the only > way that they can possibly differentiate between living people and dead > people, is kind of an absence of that smell. It's really just a difference > in how they smell, not 'Hey, we can seek out living flesh like a > bloodhound!' It occurred to me that every now and then there are zombies > that don‚Äôt really look that much more dead than an alive person. It can't > really be from a visual perspective that they‚Äôre attacking human beings. And > they don't attack each other, ever. So there has to be a reason for that. So > maybe it's some kind of a smell thing. Alongside the main cast (IronE Singleton as T-Dog, Jeryl Prescott as Jacqui, Juan Pareja as Morales), \\"Guts\\" features guest appearances from several actors and actresses, including Emma Bell as Amy and Michael Rooker as Merle Dixon. The following month after Sarah Wayne Callies was announced to play the role of Rick's wife Lori Grimes, Laurie Holden claimed the role of Andrea; Holden had previously worked with Darabont in the science-fiction horror film The Mist (2007). Andrew Rothenberg played Jim. Sam Witwer, who had collaborated with Darabont in The Mist, appeared as a dying soldier. Frances Cobb played a camp survivor. Chance Bartels played the walker shot by Merle. Kirkman stated that he was thrilled upon hearing of the actor's appearance, and added that he had known of Rooker since the comedy film Mallrats (1995). He was pleased with Rooker's performance, quipping that it was \\"'The Michael Rooker Show' for one solid episode.\\" > I actually got a chance to hang out with him and he's a totally awesome guy. > He always plays bad guys and psychos and it's weird, because he's this > really boisterous, friendly guy. But yeah, his character is very important > to the life of the show. He's a completely original character that was never > in the comic.

Club gave it a grade of B- on a F to A scale, commenting it was a step down in quality from the pilot, but said it \\"had many good qualities\\" and \\"the show still looks fantastic, and the choice to use 16mm film pays off time after time, giving everything a stark, bright quality that fits the mood perfectly.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 7 out of 10, and also noted how it was a weaker episode than the pilot. Goldman disliked the introduction of Merle, calling him \\"ridiculous\\", but enjoyed the sequence in which Rick and Glenn cover themselves in guts to disguise them from the zombies. He commented, \\"Overall, this episode had its fun moments, feeling more like an adrenalin-filled straight up horror movie than the more slow-paced pilot.

Bland was a 19th-century physician, publisher, Indian Rights Activist, founder of the National Indian Defense Association ‚ÄúNIDA‚Äù, and publisher of ‚ÄúThe Council Fire and Arbitrator‚Äù. Early life and education Born Thomas Augustus Bland on the 21st May 1830 at Bloomfield, Indiana to Thomas Bland, a Quaker who hailed from North Carolina. Raised on a farm, Bland's early education was largely self-taught. He chose the career of a physician, graduating from the Eclectic College of Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1852 Bland married Mary Cornelia \\"Cora\\" Davis of Hitesville, Illinois.Biographical History of Eminent and Self-Made Men of the State of Indiana, Western Biographical Publishing Company, Cincinnati, Ohio 1880 Career Bland served in the Civil War as a surgeon with the Union Army. Upon his discharge in 1864 he became the editor for the \\"Home Visitor\\" a literary weekly published in Indianapolis. His wife Cora, herself a fully trained medical doctor, was the associate editor. In 1865 he established the \\"Northwestern Farmer\\", which he sold in 1871. In 1870 Dr. Bland published his first book, \\"Farming as a Profession\\". In 1872 the Blands relocated to Chicago where he took over the editorship of the \\"Scientific Farmer\\". In 1872 they moved to New York where Bland assumed the editorship of the \\"Farm and Fireside\\". In 1879 Bland published his biographical work \\"Life of General B. F. Butler\\". In 1878 the Blands took up permanent residence in Washington DC with the intent to devote their lives to politics and literature. During this time period the Blands met and befriended Colonel Alfred B. Meacham who was recovering from being nearly fatally shot by Modoc Indians in California a few years earlier. Through this association the Blands got interested in the Indian cause, dedicating the rest of their lives to combat and to rectify injustice done to America's indigenous people. The Blands, together with Colonel Meacham embarked on a lecture tour lasting several years speaking at hundreds of venues throughout the northeastern United States. Together with Meacham they published in 1878 \\"The Council Fire and Arbitrator\\", a monthly dedicated to the Indian Rights cause until it folded in 1889. The Blands distinguished themselves in their efforts, assisted by fellow Indian Rights activist Caroline Weldon, albeit ultimately unsuccessfully, to fight the implementation of the Allotment Act (Dawes Act) which they deemed unfavorable to the Indians and a blatant attempt by the United States government to dispossess the Indians of much of the land guaranteed to them in numerous treaties.Pollack, Eileen.

Weiss was the UN's spokesman in Sri Lanka during the final months of the civil war. Since leaving the UN Weiss has been a vocal critic of the conduct of both the Sri Lankan military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Weiss believes that war crimes were committed during the final stages of the civil war and has called for an international investigation. According to Weiss up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final stages of the civil war. In the book Weiss recounts \\"in chilling detail\\" the final stages of the civil war, how the Sri Lankan military achieved victory and the price paid for peace by all of Sri Lanka's ethnic communities. It details how hundreds of thousands of civilians were held hostage by the Tamil Tigers in an ever-decreasing area (the cage) in northern Sri Lanka. Weiss tries to piece together events which unfolded inside the cage which had been sealed off from most independent observers by the Sri Lankan military. The book provides context to the findings of the UN panel. It also provides a history of Sri Lanka and \\"unpicks\\" the root causes of the civil war. It suggests that the country's history is full of brutal savagery. Weiss is highly critical of the Tigers but he reserves his strongest condemnation for the Sri Lankan military and the international community. Weiss believes that the Sri Lankan military could have avoided high civilian casualties if it wanted to but it chose not to do so. The international community contributed to the slaughter of the civilians by its collective \\"shoulder shrugging\\". The UN's unwillingness to provide casualty figures also contributed to the \\"zero civilian casualties\\" myth. Weiss believes that the civil war could have been averted if the grievances of the Tamils had been addressed.

After leaving the Piano Magic stable, Perls and Break formed the highly conceptual electro-acoustic duo Icebreaker. With funding provided by NATOarts, Distant Early Warning was released in September 1999 through Aesthetics.
