For the 20th Century political artist, see William Gropper. Johann Gropper (John or ) (24 February 1503, Soest - 13 March 1559, Rome) was a Roman Catholic cleric and church politician of the Reformation period. Early life: follower of Erasmus After being made keeper of the seal of the archbishopric of Cologne, he was appointed scholasticus of St. Gerson in 1527. Gropper was an adherent of Erasmus, and aided the reform efforts of Hermann von Wied, archbishop of Cologne. This led him, after having completed his legal studies at Cologne in 1525, to devote himself to theological study. He edited the Landrecht of Cologne, and also the canons of the provincial council at Cologne held in 1536 (both published in 1538, together with a detailed manual of Christian doctrine which he had composed). In both of these Gropper's Erasmian tendency showed itself; in both he took pains to make the Bible and the Church Fathers his point of departure. In many matters, especially in the doctrine of justification, he approximated Protestant views, but he did not approve of the doctrine of the Reformers concerning the concept and the organization of the Church. He championed the seven sacraments and the veneration of images and relics. He rejected the doctrine of the priesthood of believers, he defended the hierarchical order of the Middle Ages and the primacy of the pope, though on these very points his differences with the representatives of the papal system were apparent. Protestant and Jesuit writers alike censured the book. Against the Reformation in Cologne Gropper took a zealous part in the negotiations for church union and in the religious colloquies held in 1540 and 1541 in Hagenau, Worms, and Regensburg. In the latter place he secured agreement on the formulation of the doctrine of justification; but he and his sympathizers could not reach an understanding with the Protestants about the organization of the Church. When, therefore, Archbishop Hermann, felt himself committed to a far-reaching reform of ecclesiastical affairs in his archdiocese, and invited the Stra√üburg Reformer Martin Butzer for that purpose, Gropper came forward as the spokesman of the clergy of Cologne in opposition to the plans for Protestant reform proposed by his former patron; as a representative of the cathedral chapter he sought in the Landtag of March and July, 1543, to persuade the Estates to oppose Hermann and Butzer. As he was unsuccessful, he prepared an answer to the memorial for reformation which the archbishop laid before the latter Landtag. The answer was approved by a committee of the cathedral chapter and was published in 1554 in its name, in German and Latin. When even this document did not convert the archbishop, Gropper and the members of his party lodged complaints against him with the emperor and the pope. Gropper now negotiated eagerly with imperial counselors. He addressed to the emperor his Wahrhaftige Antwort against accusations by Butzer. In connection with this fight against the Protestantism, Gropper came to favor the settlement of the Jesuits in Cologne. Canisius, who was especially advanced by him, praises in the highest terms Gropper's merits in saving Catholicism within the archdiocese of Cologne. When the victory was won, and the previous coadjutor, Adolf von Schaumburg, had been enthroned as bishop, Gropper received the provostship in Bonn formerly held by a brother of Hermann. Under the new archbishop, Gropper worked by word and pen against the Protestants; he likewise acted as imperial commissioner for the carrying out of the Augsburg Interim in his native city of Soest. Later years How little in accordance with his wishes, however, ecclesiastical affairs developed in the next years, he himself states in a letter of 1556, in which he sets forth the reasons why he did not wish to accept the dignity of the cardinalate which had been offered to him. A letter of the following year betrays a still gloomier mood; he begged Petrus Canisius not to be suspicious of him if he held aloof from the religious colloquy soon to be held in Worms. In 1558 he saw new dangers arise for those near him, when Johann Gebhard von Mansfeld was chosen archbishop of Cologne. To prevent his confirmation by the pope, Gropper decided to make the journey to Rome, whither Paul IV had formerly invited him in vain. The pope received him with honor and demanded his opinion in weighty matters; nevertheless, not only did he not accomplish that which he wished in the Cologne affair, but he was denounced to the Inquisition by the Venetian Delfino. On March 13, 1559, he died in poverty, and was buried in the church of Maria dell'Anima. The pope, probably convinced by Gropper's defense that he was innocent, spoke before a consistory on March 15 in praise of the services of the deceased and transferred his benefices to his brother Kaspar. As a papal nuncio at Cologne Kaspar was later the zealous servant of the Counter-reformation, which directed its efforts against the Erasmian tendency which Gropper had once represented; with the result that in 1596 Gropper's Enchiridion, \\"the most detailed and most important pre- Tridentine dogmatic of the Reformation period,\\" was put upon the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.

Kincaid is well known for having directed several science fiction/horror films in the mid-eighties: Breeders, Mutant Hunt, and most infamously Robot Holocaust, which was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and released on Blu-ray by DiabolikDVD. Perception To a perceptive viewer some of the characters in Gage's films can be clearly understood as \\"gay identified\\", while others are just as clearly intended to represent bisexual men who normally inhabit the heterosexual world and may even be happily married. Many other characters‚Äîperhaps most of them‚Äîdefy easy categorization, however. \\"I never went out of my way to emphasize the butch or straight attributes of my guys--I always sought to portray them as representatives of the average, ordinary, for the most part, working-class citizen.\\" For all of these reasons, Kincaid's aesthetic sensibilities had a significant impact not only on his contemporaries in the adult film world but on gay-male culture as it was developing in the 1970s and 1980s. \\"He's . . . the first artist who dared to suggest that sex between men was more about camaraderie than romance, more about hot action than a lifestyle. While his characters were always working- class Joes, his '70s epics became blueprints of sexual tension-building and were also stylistically innovative.\\" Numerous filmmakers of today cite the Gage films as being highly instrumental in their own development, and one gay singer-songwriter (Mark Weigle, on Soul/Sex) used the phrase \\"a Joe Gage face\\" in his lyrics, knowing that for some listeners it would immediately evoke a certain kind of male handsomeness, in much the same way that \\"Gibson girl\\" brings to mind a specific type of feminine beauty. \\"The \\"Gage Men\\", as they were known during the heyday of the '70s, appeared more sexy Average Joe than Abercrombie & Fitch.

He was a son of the founding emperor Helian Bobo (Emperor Wulie) and a younger brother of his predecessor Helian Chang. After Helian Chang was captured by rival Northern Wei's army in 428, Helian Ding took the throne himself and for several years tried to resist Northern Wei attacks, but by 430 he had lost nearly his entire territory. In 431, he attempted to head west to try to attack Northern Liang and seize its territory, but on the way, he was intercepted by Tuyuhun's khan Murong Mugui (ÊÖïÂÆπÊÖïÁíù) and captured, ending Xia. In 432, Murong Mugui turned him over to Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei, who had him executed.  During Helian Bobo's reign  It is not known when Helian Ding was born, or who his mother was. In 414, when Helian Bobo created his son Helian Gui (Ëµ´ÈÄ£Áíù) crown prince and the other sons dukes, Helian Chang was created the Duke of Pingyuan. Helian Ding was said to have been a delinquent and frivolous youth, and Helian Bobo had low opinions of him and gave him little authority.  During Helian Chang's reign  After Helian Bobo's death in 425, Helian Ding's older brother Helian Chang (who had replaced Helian Gui as crown prince in 424) succeeded him. Helian Chang gave Helian Ding more authorities than before, and Helian Ding quickly became one of the major generals that his brother relied on. After rival Northern Wei's general Daxi Jin (ÈÅîÂ•öÊñ§) captured the important city of Chang'an in 426, Helian Chang sent Helian Ding south in spring 427 from the capital Tongwan (Áµ±Ëê¨, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) to try to capture Chang'an. He became stalemated with Daxi at Chang'an. Meanwhile, knowing that Helian Ding was occupied, Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei made an attack on Tongwan, and Helian Chang initially wanted to recall Helian Ding from Chang'an; instead, Helian Ding advised him to defend Tongwan securely to wear out the Northern Wei forces, and then he, after capture Chang'an, could then return and attack Northern Wei forces on two sides. Helian Chang agreed and did not engage Northern Wei forces. However, subsequently, receiving false information that Northern Wei forces had run out of food, he decided to attack Northern Wei forces and was soundly defeated, and he fled to Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu). Northern Wei captured Tongwan. Upon hearing the news of Tongwayn's fall, Helian Ding abandoned his campaign against Daxi and joined Helian Chang at Shanggui. Daxi gave chase, intending to destroy Xia. It might have been at this time that Helian Chang promoted Helian Ding to the title of Prince of Pingyuan. In spring 428, after initially withdrawing further from Shanggui to Pingliang (Âπ≥Ê∂º, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), Helian Chang went back on the offensive and sieged Daxi's army, which was then afflicted by illnesses, at Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö, also in modern Pingliang). However, during the siege, the Northern Wei officers Anchi Jia (ÂÆâÈÅ≤È†°) and Yuchi Juan (Â∞âÈÅ≤Áú∑) made a surprise attack on him, and he fell off his horse and was captured. Helian Ding gathered the remaining troops and withdrew to Pingliang. He took the throne himself.  Reign  Meanwhile, Daxi, ashamed that he was nearly destroyed by Hellian Chang at Anding and was only saved by his officers Anchi and Yuchi's ingenuity, proceeded further, without adequate food supplies, to try to attack Helian Ding at Pingliang, taking up a dangerous position without adequate water supply as well. A low- level Northern Wei officer who had been charged with crime then fled to the Xia camp and revealed the lack of food and water supplies that Daxi's forces were having. Helian Ding then attacked and captured Daxi. Upon hearing this, the Northern Wei general Qiudun Dui (‰∏òÊï¶Â†Ü), who was defending Anding, panicked and fled to Chang'an, and then further fled Chang'an with Chang'an's commanding general Tuoba Li (ÊãìÊãîÁ¶Æ) to Puban (Ëí≤Èò™, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), allowing Xia forces to recover Chang'an and the surrounding Guanzhong region. In summer 428, Helian Ding sent an embassy to Northern Wei requesting peace. Instead, Northern Wei's Emperor Taiwu issued an edict ordering him to surrender, which he did not do. On a hunt at which he could see the old capital Tongwan from a distance, Helian Ding lamented that if Helian Bobo had made him crown prince, Tongwan would not have fallen. However, he himself did not dare to try to recapture Tongwan. In spring 430, Liu Song launched a major attack against Northern Wei, and Northern Wei in response temporarily abandoned its territory south of the Yellow River. Helian Ding then entered into an alliance with Emperor Wen of Liu Song against Northern Wei, agreeing to destroy Northern Wei and divide its territory north of the Yellow River‚Äîwith provinces east of the Taihang Mountains going to Liu Song and west of Taihang going to Xia. However, neither party actually intended to attack Northern Wei's territory north of the Yellow River first, waiting for the other to act, and Northern Wei's Emperor Taiwu took advantage of this and decided to try to destroy Helian Ding first. In fall 430, he personally launched a direct assault on Pingliang. Meanwhile, Western Qin's prince Qifu Mumo, unable to stand pressures from Northern Liang and Tuyuhun, sought to surrender to Northern Wei, and with Northern Wei promising to give Xia's Pingliang and Anding Commanderies to him as his domain, he abandoned his capital Fuhan (ÊûπÁΩï, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu) and headed east, intending to join Northern Wei forces at Shanggui. Upon hearing this, Helian Ding personally tried to intercept Qifu Mumo, who was forced to stop at Nan'an (ÂçóÂÆâ, in modern Longxi, Gansu), with his territory having otherwise all fallen to Tuyuhun. By this time, though, the Northern Wei emperor had arrived at Pingliang, and, with Helian Chang (whom he had created Prince of Qin) with him, he had Helian Chang to try to persuade the defender of Pingliang, Helian Ding's younger brother Helian Shegan (Ëµ´ÈÄ£Á§æÂπ≤) the Duke of Shanggu to surrender. Helian Shegan initially refused. Helian Ding, hearing that Pingliang was under attack, tried to return to Pingliang to relieve it, but on the way he encountered the Northern Wei general Tuxi Bi (ÂêêÂ•öÂºº), who tricked him by pretending to be a weak force, drawing an attack from him. Tuxi then defeated Helian Ding, who was then forced to withdraw to Chungu Plains (È∂âËßöÂéü, in modern Pingliang). Northern Wei forces surrounded him, and his army became hungry and thirsty. After several days, he forcibly fought his way out of the siege, but his forces mostly collapsed, and he himself was badly injured. He gathered the remaining forces and fled to Shanggui. Around the new year 431, Helian Shegan and another brother, Helian Duluogu (Ëµ´ÈÄ£Â∫¶Ê¥õÂ≠§) the Duke of Guangyang, surrendered Pignliang to Northern Wei, and Anding fell as well. The Northern Wei emperor seized Helian Ding's empress and gave her to his general Doudai Tian (Ë±Ü‰ª£Áî∞) as a concubine. The other Xia cities' defenders also fled or were captured, allowing Northern Wei to take those cities. Helian Ding himself felt he could not hold Shanggui much further, sent his uncle Helian Weifa (Ëµ´ÈÄ£Èüã‰ºê) the Duke of Beiping to attack Western Qin's only remaining city, Nan'an. The people of Nan'an suffered from the lack of food so much that they engaged in cannibalism. Qifu Mumo, unable to do anything else, surrendered. Helian Weifa delivered Qifu Mumo to Shanggui, and Helian Ding executed Qifu Mumo and his clan. Helian Ding then headed west and crossed the Yellow River at Zhicheng (Ê≤ªÂüé, in modern Linxia), intending to attack Northern Liang and seize its territory. However, the khan of Tuyuhun, Murong Mugui (ÊÖïÂÆπÊÖïÁíù), had anticipated this and sent his brothers Murong Muliyan (ÊÖïÂÆπÊÖïÂà©Âª∂) and Murong Shiqian (ÊÖïÂÆπÊãæËôî) to intercept Helian Ding, and as the Xia army was crossing the river, Tuyuhun forces attacked and captured Helian Ding, ending Xia.  After capture by Murong Mugui  Murong Mugui did not kill Helian Ding initially. In fall 431, however, he sent messengers to Northern Wei to declare his loyalty and to indicate that he was willing to deliver Helian Ding to Northern Wei. In response, Northern Wei's Emperor Taiwu created Murong Mugui the Prince of Xiqin and gave him rewards, and in spring 432 Murong Mugui delivered Helian Ding to Northern Wei. The Northern Wei emperor executed Helian Ding. Empress Very little is known about the wife of Helian Ding, not even her name. Helian Ding took the throne in 428 after his brother Helian Chang was captured by rival Northern Wei's forces, and it was sometime after that he created her empress. When his brothers Helian Shegan (Ëµ´ÈÄ£Á§æÂπ≤) the Duke of Shanggu and Helian Duluogu (Ëµ´ÈÄ£Â∫¶Ê¥õÂ≠§) the Duke of Guangyang surrendered his capital Pingliang (Âπ≥Ê∂º, in modern Pingliang, Gansu) to Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei in 430, she was captured. Emperor Taiwu gave her to his general Doudai Tian (Ë±Ü‰ª£Áî∞) as a concubine. Nothing further is known about her.

Tiraspol provisional stamps  Tiraspol provisional stamps issued in 1992 by overprinting two stamps of the Soviet Union Transnistria declared its independence from Moldova on September 2, 1990, and in June 1992, the postal authorities in Tiraspol, the capital and administrative centre of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, overprinted sheets of two definitive stamps of the former Soviet Union. The overprints read '–¢–∏—Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª—å / 30-VI-92' (Tiraspol / 30-June-92) and two new values, '20 –∫–æ–ø.' (20 kopecks) and '28 –∫–æ–ø.' (28 kopecks). These provisionals were only in use from July 3 to July 21, 1992, and were then confiscated and destroyed by Moldavian authorities in Kishinev (now Chi»ôinƒÉu).  First PMR stamps  On November 18, 1993, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (Council) of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic made decision on issuing the first stamps. The first Transnistria stamp was designed by Grigoriy Bronza and appeared on December 31, 1993. Since then it has typically issued between 3 and 5 different series of stamps per year. The region's name is given only in Cyrillic, as '–ü–û–ß–¢–ê –ü–ú–†' (POST OF PMR, with PMR standing for Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic). = Validity = The postage stamps of Transnistria are not recognised outside of the country and are valid only for domestic service within Transnistria. International mail and mail to the rest of Moldova requires Moldovan postage stamps. File:–ú–∞—Ä–∫–∞ –∞–Ω—Å–∞–º–±–ª—è –í–∏–æ—Ä–∏–∫–∞.jpgPostage stamps of Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, 2015.

Bogus stamp issues have been a problem in the region for several years, with private persons overprinting stamps of the Soviet Union or printing labels resembling Transnistrian stamps, and selling them to unsuspecting collectors. The bogus stamps usually give the region's name in Cyrillic, as '–ü–ú–†' , although sometimes the Latin letters 'PMR' are seen instead. There is no consistent practice, with some stamps only inscribed in Cyrillic and others only in Latin.

Calvert School is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) as well as the Association of Independent Maryland and DC Schools (AIMS).  History  Established in 1896 when four Baltimore families hired German school teacher Fraulein Martha Auguste Schurmann to conduct traditional kindergarten classes for their children, Calvert School continues to build upon the foundation laid by Fraulein Schurmann. The first children were taught above Croft and Conlyn's drug store. In 1899, Calvert School hired its first Head Master, Virgil M. Hillyer, a Harvard graduate. Calvert School's current Lower School on Tuscany Road was designed by Hillyer along with Laurence Hall Fowler. They worked together to create the \\"ideal school.\\" Hillyer believed that the school should be designed with the student in mind. Hillyer insisted on larger windows so that rooms would be pleasant to children and let in light and air. He also made sure the smallest details were not overlooked, such as having the ends of benches in the assembly hall carved with animals. Hillyer based the animals on figures used on buildings in the Middle Ages to ward off evil spirits. Even the lockers were decorated with a pear or jug or a cup and saucer, each to illustrate one of Hillyer's favorite lessons. Many of the details that Hillyer influenced are still apparent in the school in the present day.

At Calvert School, the youngest students begin their education with a focus on the fundamentals. Children are taught the basics of reading, writing, and mathematics to develop a mastery of these subjects through their course of study in the Lower School. In Lower School, students are grouped by age, not grade. The students are grouped according to the age that they turn during the school year. As early as Fifth Age, children are learning reading and math skills, as well as being introduced to a foreign language. Beginning in the Seventh Age, students learn the formal Calvert Script and how to develop and write compositions. Also, at this time students begin to keep folder papers, a collection of polished work from over the course of the school year, so that students master skills that will prepare them for future academic excellence. Students share folder papers with faculty members and administrators before sending them home. Parents review the final work of their student on a monthly basis. By Tenth Age, students have mastered these fundamentals and are ready to enter the Calvert Middle School with a sense of purpose and pride in their work. At Calvert's Middle School, children are exposed to a wide variety of subjects, while continuing to master the skills learned in the Lower School. Teachers prepare students for future academic excellence by further developing foundational skills and critical thinking. Calvert prepares Middle School students for upper school through the work of an Upper School Placement Team, which begins in Seventh Grade. In Eighth Grade students prepare for school visits and routinely meet with a Placement Coordinator throughout the fall and winter. In Middle School, students are exposed to a variety of programs to support them as they prepare for high school and beyond. Students partake in a student leadership program to help each student recognize their strengths and improve upon their weaknesses. At Calvert, Middle School students are tasked with important roles as they are the oldest in the school. Beginning in Seventh Grade, students apply for positions as school leaders. Once selected, these leaders serve as Calvert Captains, Diversity Club coordinators, and members of the Black & Gold Committee. Middle School students also have a Middle School Advisory where each student is a member of a single-sex homeroom. During homeroom, the advisor/homeroom teacher monitors each student's academic and social progress during three, twenty-five minute sessions per week. To further enhance student leadership, Calvert also believes that community service is an integral part of the education experience. In order to provide meaningful experiences for students, students participate in a variety of projects ranging from stream cleans to writing letters to troops, and beyond. Projects are completed in a variety of settings and are tailored to the age group participating. By the time a student graduates they have a basic understanding of the community in which they live, they advance their problem solving and critical thinking skills, and they gain an appreciation for their ability to impact the world around them in positive ways.  Athletics  Calvert School believes physical activity and athletic competitions play a big role in the lives of students as they build character, teamwork, and good sportsmanship. Lower School students meet for Physical Education classes multiple times a week. Once the children reach Ninth Age they join special teams called the Crows, Canaries, Hoppers, or Crickets. These are single-gender groups that compete with each other throughout the year in sporting matches. It is a wonderful way to foster a sense of belonging and school spirit as the students prepare to compete on interscholastic teams when they enter Sixth Grade. Middle School has an extensive athletic program, including over twenty sports teams spread over three seasons. More than 90% of our students participate in team sports, which include football, flag football, field hockey, soccer, basketball, squash, lacrosse, baseball, and cross country. Our intramural program provides opportunities for our Fifth Graders, who can meet after school, to play a variety of sports and games with the goal of instilling a strong interest in healthy living.  Home Instruction Division  The Calvert Home Instruction Division was originally developed by the School's first Head Master, Virgil Hillyer, in 1905. Calvert's homeschooling program is widely considered the first of its kind. The homeschooling program grew from a handful of students in the early years to over 10,000 per year by the 1990s and enrolled students in all 50 states and hundreds of countries throughout the world. In 2001, the homeschooling program became Calvert Education Services and in 2013 was sold to a private owner. Calvert Education Services is no longer affiliated with the day school.

The Biafo Glacier presents a trekker with several days of strenuous boulder hopping, with views throughout and Snow Lake near the high point. Snow Lake, consisting of parts of the upper Biafo Glacier and its tributary glacier Sim Gang, is one of the world's largest basins of snow or ice in the world outside the polar regions, up to in depth. The Biafo Glacier is the world's third longest glacier outside the polar regions, second only to the Siachen Glacier, India-Pakistan and Tajikistan's long Fedchenko Glacier. Campsites along the Biafo are located off of the glacier, adjacent to the lateral moraines and steep mountainsides. The first three (heading up from the last village before the glacier, the thousand-year-old Askole village) are beautiful sites with flowing water nearby. Mango and Namla, the first two campsites, are often covered in flowers and Namla has an amazing waterfall very near the camping area. Baintha, the third camp site, is often used as a rest day. A large green meadow, it has a few running streams near the camp and many places to spend the day rock climbing or rappelling. Evidence of wildlife can be seen on the trek, including Ibex and the Markhor Mountain Goat. The area is also known for Himalayan brown bears and snow leopards, although sightings are rare.

It works by applying an alphamap (also called a \\"weightmap\\" or a \\"splat map\\") to the higher levels, thereby revealing the layers underneath where the alphamap is partially or completely transparent. The term was coined by Crawfis et al.Texture Splats for 3D Vector and Scalar Field Visualization  Optimizations  Since texture splatting is commonly used for terrain rendering in computer games, various optimizations are required. Because the underlying principle is for each texture to have its own alpha channel, large amounts of memory can easily be consumed. As a solution to this problem, multiple alpha maps can be combined into one texture using the red channel for one map, the blue for another, and so on. This effectively uses a single texture to supply alpha maps for four real-color textures. The alpha textures can also use a lower resolution than the color textures, and often the color textures can be tiled. Terrains can also be split into chunks where each chunk can have its own textures. Say there is a certain texture on one part of the terrain that doesn‚Äôt appear anywhere else on it: it would be a waste of memory and processing time if the alpha map extended over the whole terrain if only 10% of it was actually required. If the terrain is split into chunks then the alpha map can also be split up according to the chunks and so now instead of 90% of that specific map being wasted only 20% may be.

It is located in the City of Mitcham. Located at the foot of the Adelaide Hills, it is bordered on the east by the South Eastern Freeway, and the Old Toll House, which marked the traditional entrance to the city of Adelaide in the 19th century. History In the early 1850s, Robert Forsyth Macgeorge bought land in the area and built a house, naming the estate Urrbrae after the village Haugh of Urr in Scotland; the word brae refers to a hillside, especially near a river or creek. One notable son was the architect James Macgeorge (1832‚Äì1918). Demographics The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 992 persons in Urrbrae on census night. Of these, 49.3% were male and 50.7% were female. The majority of residents (71.4%) were of Australian birth, with other common census responses being England (6.3%) and South Africa (2.2%). The age distribution of Urrbrae residents was comparable to that of the greater Australian population. 70.9% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 29.1% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%. Attractions =Urrbrae House Historic Precinct= Urrbrae House Urrbrae House is a two-storey, bluestone mansion located on Walter Young Avenue, on the Waite Campus of the University of Adelaide. Not the suburb's namesake, the current house was actually completed in 1891 by the philanthropist Peter Waite, replacing the original single-storey home of Robert MacGeorge, which was for many years rented by Edward Stirling Snr. It was probably Waite, a Scot like MacGeorge, who opted to carry on the name Urrbrae. For many years, Urrbrae House was the family home of Waite, his wife Matilda and their family. After Peter and Matilda's death, the house was bequeathed to the University of Adelaide, being handed over in February 1923 by the couple's two daughters. Urrbrae House was the first home in Adelaide to be electrified.

The language is supported by a software system that includes an execution engine, a graphical editor and a worklist handler. The system is available as Open source software under the LGPL license. Production-level uses of the YAWL system include a deployment by first:utility and first:telecom in the UK to automate front-end service processes, and by the Australian film television and radio school to coordinate film shooting processes. The YAWL system has also been used for teaching in more than 20 universities.yawl-system.com Features * Comprehensive support for the workflow patterns. * Support for advanced resource allocation policies, including four-eyes principle and chained execution. * Support for dynamic adaptation of workflow models through the notion of worklets. * Sophisticated workflow model validation features (e.g. deadlock detection at design-time). * XML-based model for data definition and manipulation based on XML Schema, XPath and XQuery. * XML-based interfaces for monitoring and controlling workflow instances and for accessing execution logs. * XML-based plug-in interfaces for connecting third-party web services with the system, including third-party worklist/task handlers. * Automated form generation from XML schema. History The language and its supporting system were originally developed by researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology and Queensland University of Technology. Subsequently, several organizations such as InterContinental Hotels Group, first:telecom and ATOS WorldlineATOS Worldline have contributed to the initiative. The original drivers behind YAWL were to define a workflow language that would support all (or most) of the workflow patterns and that would have a formal semantics. Observing that Petri nets came close to supporting most of the workflow patterns, the designers of YAWL decided to take Petri nets as a starting point and to extend this formalism with three main constructs, namely or-join, cancellation sets, and multi- instance activities. These three concepts are aimed at supporting five of the workflow patterns that were not directly supported in Petri nets, namely synchronizing merge, discriminator, N-out-of-M join, multiple instance with no a priori runtime knowledge and cancel case. In addition, YAWL adds some syntactical elements to Petri nets in order to intuitively capture other workflow patterns such as simple choice (xor-split), simple merge (xor-join), and multiple choice (or-split). During the design of the language, it turned out that some of the extensions that were added to Petri nets were difficult or even impossible to re-encode back into plain Petri nets. As a result, the original formal semantics of YAWL are defined as a labelled transition system and not in terms of Petri nets. The fact that YAWL is based on formal semantics has enabled the implementation of several techniques for analyzing YAWL processes. In particular, the YAWL system includes a static analysis tool called WofYAWL. YAWL vs. BPEL YAWL is sometimes seen as an alternative to BPEL. A major advantage of BPEL is that it is driven by a standardization committee supported by several IT industry players. As a result, BPEL is supported by a significant number of tools (both proprietary and open-source) while YAWL has a single implementation at present. Also, several researchers have captured the formal semantics of subsets of BPEL in terms of various formalisms, including Petri nets, process algebra and finite state machine. This has paved the way for the development of static analysis tools for BPEL that can compete with the static analysis capabilities provided by the YAWL system. On the other hand, it has been noted that standard BPEL fails to support human tasks, that is, tasks that are allocated to human actors and that require these actors to complete actions, possibly involving a physical performance. A number of BPEL engines already provide extensions to BPEL for human tasks, but these extensions are yet to be standardized. In contrast, YAWL provides a unified interface for worklist services based on web services standards. This interface allows developers to build their own worklist service to support human tasks according to their needs. In addition, the YAWL system comes with a default worklist service that supports several types of human task allocation and handling. Another advantage of YAWL is its support for workflow patterns, although the gap between YAWL and BPEL in this respect may be reduced by new constructs that are included in BPEL version 2.0.

The Frisii were among the migrating Germanic tribes that settled along the North Sea in the 4th century BC. They came to control the area from roughly present-day Bremen to Bruges, and conquered many of the smaller offshore islands. In the 1st century BC, the Frisii halted a Roman advance and thus managed to maintain their independence. In the Germanic pre-Migration Period (i.e., before c. 300 AD) the Frisii and the related Chauci, Saxons, and Angles inhabited the Continental European coast from the Zuyder Zee to south Jutland., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood uses the term 'North German' to distinguish them from the 'Rhine Germans' (the Caninnefates, Batavians, and \\"Frankish\\" tribes). All of these peoples shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood cites Todd's The Northern Barbarians 100 BC-AD 300 (1987) for this conclusion. On the east they were originally bordered by the Ampsivarii who lived at the mouth of the Ems until AD 58,, The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 55. Events of AD 54-58\\\\. The Germans under Arminius had wiped out 3 Roman legions under Varus at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9. The Ampsivarii had not supported the German cause and were ostracized as a result. Many years later, c. AD 58, the Chauci took the opportunity to expel them and occupy their land at the mouth of the River Ems., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood cites Tacitus as well as a number of other sources. at which time the Chauci expelled them and gained a border with the Frisii. The Chauci to the east were eventually assimilated by their presumed descendants the Saxons in the 3rd century. Some or all of the Frisii may have joined into the Frankish and Saxon peoples in late Roman times, but they would retain a separate identity in Roman eyes until at least 296, when they were forcibly resettled as laeti (i.e., Roman- era serfs) and thereafter disappear from recorded history. Their tentative existence in the 4th century is confirmed by archaeological discovery of a type of earthenware unique to 4th-century Frisia, called terp Tritzum, showing that an unknown number of Frisii were resettled in Flanders and Kent,. Looijenga cites Gerrets' The Anglo-Frisian Relationship Seen from an Archaeological Point of View (1995) for this contention. likely as laeti under the aforementioned Roman coercion. The lands of the Frisii were largely abandoned by c. 400 due to Migration wars, climatic deterioration and flooding caused by sea level rise. They lay empty for one or two centuries, when changing environmental and political conditions made the region habitable again. At that time, settlers that came to be known as 'Frisians' repopulated the coastal regions. Medieval and later accounts of 'Frisians' refer to these 'new Frisians' rather than to the ancient Frisii., The case of the Frisians. Description What little is known of the Frisii is provided by a few Roman accounts, most of them military. Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79) said their lands were forest-covered with tall trees growing up to the edge of the lakes., Natural History, Bk XVI Ch 2: Wonders connected with trees in the northern regions. They lived by agriculture, The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 54. Events of AD 54-58\\\\. This was confirmed by Tacitus when he said that in an incident where the Frisii had taken over land, they then settled into houses, sowed the fields, and cultivated the soil. and raising cattle., The Annals, Bk IV, Ch 72-74\\\\. Events of AD 15-16\\\\. Tacitus specifically refers to the herds of the Frisii. In the late 1st century the Romans referred to the 'Greater Frisii' as living to the east of the lake Flevo, and the 'Lesser Frisii' to the west of it, so-called for their proportional power, and with the settlements of both stretching along the border of the Rhine to the ocean., The Germany, XXXV. (The shape of the Netherlands/Low Countries has varied extremely in the last 2000 years. Historic maps should always be used or modern maps should be adapted. Sea level rise and storm surges destroyed 900 000 hectares. 500 000 hectares were reclaimed since the year 1200.) In his Germania Tacitus would describe all the Germanic peoples of the region as having elected kings with limited powers and influential military leaders who led by example rather than by authority. The people lived in spread-out settlements., The Germany, Ch V, VII, XVI. He specifically noted the weakness of Germanic political hierarchies in reference to the Frisii, when he mentioned the names of two kings of the 1st century Frisii and added that they were kings \\"as far as the Germans are under kings\\"., The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 54. Events of AD 54-58. Early Roman accounts of war and raiding do not mention the Frisii as participants, though the neighboring Canninefates (to the west and southwest, in the delta) and Chauci (to the east) are named in that regard. The earliest mention of the Frisii tells of Drusus' 12 BC war against the Rhine Germans and the Chauci. The Romans did not attack them after devastating the lands of the Rhine Germans, but merely passed through their territory and along their coast in order to attack the Chauci. The account says that the Frisii were \\"won over\\", suggesting a Roman suzerainty was imposed. Over the course of time the Frisii would provide Roman auxiliaries through treaty obligations, but the tribe would also appear in its own right in concert with other Germanic tribes, opposing the Romans. Accounts of wars therefore mention the Frisii on both sides of the conflict, though the actions of troops under treaty obligation were separate from the policies of the tribe. Wars with the Romans The Frisii were little more than occasional and incidental players in Roman accounts of history, which focus on Roman actions that were of interest to Roman readers. As a consequence, references to them are disjointed and offer little useful information about them. When Drusus brought Roman forces through Frisii lands in 12 BC and \\"won them over\\", he placed a moderate tax on them. However, a later Roman governor raised the requirements and exacted payment, at first decimating the herds of the Frisii, then confiscating their land, and finally taking wives and children into bondage. By AD 28 the Frisii had had enough. They hanged the Roman soldiers collecting the tax and forced the governor to flee to a Roman fort, which they then besieged. The propraetor of Germania Inferior, Lucius Apronius, raised the siege and attacked the Frisii, but was defeated at the Battle of Baduhenna Wood after suffering heavy losses. For whatever reason, the Romans did not seek revenge and the matter was closed. The prestige of the Frisii among the neighboring Germanic tribes was raised considerably., The Annals, Bk IV, Ch 72-74\\\\. Events of AD 15-16. After their experiences with the predatory Roman governor and Lucius Apronius, the Frisii became disaffected towards Rome. In AD 47, a certain Gannascus of the Canninefates led the Frisii and the Chauci to rebel. They raided along the then-wealthy coast of Gallia Belgica., The Annals, Bk XI, Ch 18-19\\\\. Events of AD 47-48. The Roman military commander, Corbulo, campaigned successfully against the Germanic tribes,, The Annals, Bk XVI, Ch 17. Events of 65-66 (Rome and Parthia--Campaigns of Corbulo in the East). Tacitus makes the parenthetical comment that Corbulo had driven the Chauci out of the provinces of Lower Germany which they had invaded in AD 47. For the Chauci and for the Frisii this meant Roman occupation, with the Romans specifying where they must live, with a fort built among them, and forcing a Roman-style senate, magistrates, and constitution upon them., The Annals, Bk XI, Ch 18-19\\\\. Events of AD 47-48. The Frisii are next mentioned in 54, when they occupied empty, Roman-controlled land near the Rhine, settling into houses and sowing and plowing fields. The Romans attempted to persuade them to leave, and even invited two Frisii kings to Rome to meet Nero, who ordered them to leave. The Frisii refused, whereupon a Roman military force coerced them, killing any who resisted., The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 55. Events of AD 54-58. In AD 69 the Batavi and other tribes rose against Roman rule in the Revolt of the Batavi, becoming a general uprising by all the Germans in the region, including the Frisii. Things went well for the Germans at first. One of the early leaders, Brinno of the Canninefates tribe, quickly defeated a Roman force of two cohorts and took their camp., The Histories, Bk IV, Ch 14-15: Revolt of Civilis and the Batavi. The capable Civilis ultimately succeeded to leadership of the Germanic side and inflicted heavy casualties on the Romans, even besieging Roman strongholds such as Vetera., The Histories, Bk IV, Ch 23: The Siege of Vetera. On the sea, a Roman flotilla was captured by a Germanic one., Dark Age Naval Power. However, the war did not end well for the Germans. Led by Cerialis, the Romans ultimately forced a humiliating peace on the Batavi and stationed a legion on their territory. In the course of the war, both the Frisii and the Chauci had auxiliaries serving under the Romans. In an assault by Civilis at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis (at modern Cologne), a cohort of Chauci and Frisii had been trapped and burned., The Histories, Translator's Summary of Chief Events., The Histories, Bk IV, Ch 79. Final demise of the ancient Frisii The emperor Constantius Chlorus campaigned successfully against several Germanic peoples during the internecine civil wars that brought him to sole power over the Roman Empire. Among them were the Frisii and Chamavi, who were described in the Panegyrici Latini (Manuscript VIII) as being forced to resettle within Roman territory as laeti (i.e., Roman-era serfs) in c. 296. This is the last reference to the ancient Frisii in the historical record. However, they appear once more, now in the archaeological record. The discovery of a type of earthenware unique to 4th century Frisia known as terp Tritzum shows that an unknown number of them were resettled in Flanders and Kent, likely as laeti under the aforementioned Roman coercion. right If there were any Frisii left in Frisia, they fell victim to the whims of nature, civil strife and piracy. After several hundred years of favorable conditions, the natural environment in the low-lying coastal regions of northwestern Europe began to deteriorate c. 250 AD and gradually worsened over the next 200 years. Rising sea levels and storm surges combined to flood some areas. Many deserted village sites were silted over. The situation was probably aggravated by a shift to a cooler, wetter climate in the region as well as by the introduction of malaria and other epidemic diseases. In the 3rd and 4th centuries the population of Frisia steadily decreased, and by the 5th century it dropped dramatically. Archaeological surveys indicate that only small pockets of the original population stayed behind (e.g. in the Groningen coastal marshes). The coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next one or two centuries. As soon as conditions improved, Frisia received an influx of new settlers, mostly from regions later characterized as Saxon, and these would eventually be referred to as 'Frisians', though they were not necessarily descended from the ancient Frisii. It is these 'new Frisians' who are largely the ancestors of the medieval and modern Frisians. Their Old Frisian language, however, was more intricately related to Old English spoken by their relatives settling abroad, than to the Old Saxon language spoken by the people staying behind in Germany. Suggested Roman references =Auxiliaries at Hadrian's Wall= One of the entries of the Notitia Dignitatum reads \\"Tribunus cohortis primae Frixagorum Vindobala\\", referring to the office of a tribune of the first cohort of the 'Frixagi', once stationed at Vindobala (at modern Rudchester) on Hadrian's Wall. Efforts have sometimes been made to connect this auxiliary unit with the Frisii by supposing that the original document must have said \\"Frisiavonum\\" and a later copyist mistakenly wrote \\"Frixagorum\\"., for one modern example. The full text reads: \\"ND Oc. XL.36 places cohors I Frixagorum at Rudchester; it is presumed that this is a copyist's error for Frisiavonum. In the third century, Rudchester was held by a quingenary cohort, but its name does not survive; analogy would suggest that it was probably I Frisavonum.\\" Some works make the claim in passing, perhaps citing someone else's claim of a copyist's error as justification., for example. A list of the stations on Hadrian's Wall is given, after which an appendix offers a summary and modern names. A translation of the Notitia Dignitatum entry \\"Tribunus cohortis primae Frixagorum Uindobala\\" is given as \\"The Tribune of the First Cohort of the Frixagi at Vindobala\\" (p. 282), after which is offered (p. 285): \\"4. VINDOBALA, which was garrisoned by the First Cohort of the Frixagi, is represented by RUTCHESTER; of the Frixagi nothing is known, but B√∂cking suggests that for Frixagorum we should read Frisiavonum, i.e., Frisians.\\" The author is referring to Eduardus B√∂cking's 1853 work on the Notitia Dignitatum. =The Frisiavones= The Frisiavones (or Frisiabones) are mentioned in Pliny the Elder's Natural History (AD 79). They are listed as a people of the islands in and near the Rhine River, as are the Frisii., Natural History, Bk IV.Ch 29(.15)--Ninety-six islands of the Gallic ocean. They also appear as a people of northern Gaul in the chapter on Gallia Belgica,, Natural History, Bk IV.Ch 31(.17)--Gallia Belgica. their name given between those of the Sunici and Betasi (not to be confused with the Batavi). The inscription stone found at Melandra Castle Tangible evidence of the existence of the Frisavones includes several inscriptions found in Britain, from Roman Manchester and from Melandra Castle near modern Glossop in Derbyshire. The Melandra Castle inscription reads \\"CHO. T. FRISIAVO C. VAL VITALIS\\", which may be expanded to become \\"Cohortis Primae Frisiauonum Centurio Valerius Vitalis\\", which may be translated as \\"Valerius Vitalis, Centurion of the First Cohort of the Frisiavones\\".. The author asserts in passing and without explanation that this is a reference to the Frisians. The entire publication appeared as a reprint in the 1906-1907 publication of the Journal of the Derbyshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, volumes 29-30. Suggestions that the Frisiavones were actually the Frisii center on the similarity in names, combined with the Roman classification of 'Lesser Frisii' to the west of the Zuiderzee and 'Greater Frisii' to the east of it (which provides a reason as to why the Frisii might have been known by two different names). However, Pliny's placement of the Frisiavones in northern Gaul is not near the known location of the Frisii, which is acceptable if the Frisavones are a separate people, but not if they are a part of a greater Frisian tribe., A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, FRISIABONES. Theodor Mommsen (The Provinces of the Roman Empire from Caesar to Diocletian, 1885) believed that the Germanic tribes of the region consisted of two parts, one having come under Roman influence and the other having remained outside of Roman influence, and he concluded that the Frisiavones were the same people as the Frisii.. Mommsen's argument is in footnote 2. However, his reasoning parsed the accounts of Tacitus and Pliny selectively: he interpreted the 'Lesser Frisii' and 'Greater Frisii' of Tacitus to refer to the Roman-influenced Frisavones and the non-Roman- influenced Frisii; he considered Pliny's account that mentioned both the Frisiavones and the Frisii to be consistent with the model; and he rejected Pliny's account placing the Frisiavones in northern Gaul, saying that it \\"is beyond doubt incorrect\\". Early medieval 'Frisian' references The Panegyrici Latini in c. 297 is the last mention of the Frisii by that name. There is no mention of them by any other name for nearly three centuries, when the name re-emerges as 'Frisians'. These later references are all connected to the ascendancy of the Franks under the Merovingians, who referred to the people who had resettled the lands of the ancient Frisii as 'Frisians'., The case of the Frisians. The interpretation of these references to 'Frisians' as references to the ancient Frisii has occasionally been made. The Byzantine scholar Procopius, writing c. 565 in his Gothic Wars (Bk IV, Ch 20), said that \\"Brittia\\" in his time (a different word from his more usual \\"Bretannia\\") was occupied by three peoples: Angles, Frisians and Britons. Procopius said that he was relating information from an informant, likely a member of a Frankish delegation to the court at Byzantium, and did not assert the information as fact. Other information that he related included the assertion that there were no horses in Britain, that Hadrian's Wall separated the temperate parts of the island from the uninhabitable parts, and that 'countless people' had attested that Britain was the home of dead souls., Procopius and the Sixth Century. His information about Britain, while occasionally useful, is not considered authoritative., Dark Age Naval Power., The case of the Frisians. Venantius Fortunatus was a poet to the Frankish Merovingian court and wrote a eulogy to the Merovingian king Chilperic, who had died in 584. A list of peoples who were said to fear Chilperic's power is given and includes the Frisians, as well as the Suebi, Goths, Basques, Danes, Jutes, Saxons, and Britons. The eulogies of this age were intended to praise the high status of the subject, and the sudden reappearance of a list of old tribal names fitted into poetic meters is given little historical value. The context is poetic license rather than historical accuracy. Coins with the obverse and reverse inscriptions 'AVDVLFVS FRISIA' and 'VICTVRIA AVDVLFO', as well as 'FRISIA' and 'AVDVLFVS' have been found at Escharen, a village in the Dutch province of North Brabant. The stylistic quality suggests that they are of Northern Frankish origin of that era rather than Frisian, besides which a local production using a self- descriptive country name (i.e., 'FRISIA') would be unheard of in that era., The case of the Frisians. Other medieval 'Frisian' references Frisia appears in the Old English heroic poem Beowulf, which tells a story of events of the early 6th century. In it, the Geatish king Hygelac is killed while raiding Frisia. It has been noted that Gregory of Tours (c. 538-594) mentioned a Danish king Chlochilaichus who was killed while invading Frankish territory in the early 6th century, suggesting that, in this instance, Beowulf might have a basis in historical facts. However, Gregory was writing little more than fifty years after the events and may have based his story on eyewitness accounts, yet he makes no mention of Frisia or the Frisians. The poem is not considered a rich source of historical facts by Beowulf scholars., The case of the Frisians. The Historia Brittonum gives a list of 33 ancient cities of Britain, among them 'Cair Peris', its location unspecified. It also contains a reference to the Picts and Orkney and a place 'ultra mare Frenessicum'.. The 'Cair' in 'Cair Peris' is reasonably taken to be Welsh 'Caer' (fort), while 'Peris' is a matter of speculation and conjecture, including the supposition that it is a reference to 'Frisians'. In the context of the Historia, the 'mare Frenessicum' coincides nicely with the Firth of Forth. While the Historia is often useful to scholars, it is also the source of storyline details that have no discernible provenance. It was written more than 500 years after the last unambiguous reference to the ancient Frisii (the Panegyrici Latini in c. 297), and at a time when medieval Frisia and the Frisians were playing a dominant role in North Sea trade.

The dimension of a Cartan subgroup, and therefore of a Cartan subalgebra, is the rank of G. Conventions The identity component of a subgroup has the same Lie algebra. There is no standard convention for which one of the subgroups with this property is called the Cartan subgroup, especially in the case of disconnected groups. Definitions A Cartan subgroup of a compact connected Lie group is a maximal connected Abelian subgroup (a maximal torus). Its Lie algebra is a Cartan subalgebra. For disconnected compact Lie groups there are several inequivalent definitions of a Cartan subgroup. The most common seems to be the one given by David Vogan, who defines a Cartan subgroup to be the group of elements that normalize a fixed maximal torus and fix the fundamental Weyl chamber. This is sometimes called the large Cartan subgroup. There is also a small Cartan subgroup, defined to be the centralizer of a maximal torus. These Cartan subgroups need not be abelian in general. For connected algebraic groups over an algebraically closed field a Cartan subgroup is usually defined as the centralizer of a maximal torus. In this case the Cartan subgroups are connected, nilpotent, and are all conjugate.

There are several such dictionaries from different publishers. The most comprehensive one, published by Dankook University Publishing, contains 53,667 Chinese characters and 420,269 compound words. This dictionary was a project of the Dankook University Institute of Oriental Studies, which started in June 1977 and was completed 28 October 2008, and cost 31 billion KRW, or US$25 million.Victor Mair, Who Has the Biggest Dictionary?, 9 October 2008World‚Äôs Biggest Chinese Dictionary Completed ‚Äì Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) The dictionary comprises 16 volumes (including an index volume) totalling over 20,000 pages. In addition to the Han-Han Daesajeon, in 1966, Dankook University completed the \\"Dictionary of Korean Chinese Characters.\\" Composed of 4 volumes with more than 4,410 pages, this dictionary \\"catalogs Chinese characters made and used only by our Korean ancestors (182 characters) as well as examples of Chinese words with Korean usages (84,000 words).\\" History With no Chinese dictionaries with Korean translations, most Korean scholars were resigned to relying on Chinese dictionaries in foreign languages to interpret original Chinese texts. Dr. Choong-sik Chang, the president of Dankook University, brought Lee Hee-seung, the leading authority on Korean literature, to head Dankook's Institute of Oriental Studies. Scholars were invited as advisers in 1977 and as editors to start compilation in 1978. Initially, the university foundation turned down the project after financial difficulties, and concerned senior scholars tried to dissuade Chang from compiling the dictionary. In 2009, Dankook University presented the first complete edition of the Han-Han Daesajeon, or the \\"Great Chinese-Korean Dictionary\\". 200,000 people worked on the dictionary for 132,800 days, and scholars at Dankook continue to revise and add footnotes to the dictionary. The scale of the existing large Chinese character dictionaries of other countries is as follows: (Dankook University News cross reference) * China's Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Words: 23,000 characters, 380,000 words * Taiwan's Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language: 50,000 characters, 400,000 words * Japan's Great Chinese‚ÄìJapanese Dictionary (Â§ßÊº¢ÂíåËæûÂÖ∏): 50,305 characters, 540,000 words * China's Great Compendium of Chinese Characters (Ê±âËØ≠Â§ßÂ≠óÂÖ∏) (Second Edition): 60,370 characters Others Classical Chinese character dictionaries are an essential tool for accessing and understanding traditional humanities with a foundation in Chinese literature, not only in Chinese-speaking world but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. The first notable effort to compile a comprehensive classical Chinese character dictionary was made by Tetsuji Morohashi (1883‚Äì1982), a Japanese scholar. Tetsuji recognized the need and grew determined to compile a Chinese‚ÄìJapanese Dictionary while studying abroad in China. Despite his manuscripts being burned in a fire during World War II, his publisher going bankrupt, and numerous other setbacks, after 32 years of collaborative work, the Dai Kan-Wa Jiten or \\"Great Chinese‚ÄìJapanese Dictionary\\" was finally completed. Taiwan's Defense Committee followed suit with a 10-year effort, along with the Academia Sinica, to complete the Zhongwen Da Cidian, or \\"Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language.\\" In 1975, China also made the compilation of a Chinese character dictionary a national project. Collaboration attracted the participation of 43 universities, as well as numerous research centers and scholars nationwide, yielding the 12 volume Hanyu Da Cidian or \\"Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Words\\" in 1993.

Etymology  The Caverphone was created by David Hood in the Caversham Project at the University of Otago in New Zealand in 2002, revised in 2004. It was created to assist in data matching between late 19th century and early 20th century electoral rolls, where the name only needed to be in a \\"commonly recognisable form\\". The algorithm was intended to apply to those names that could not easily be matched between electoral rolls, after the exact matches were removed from the pool of potential matches. The algorithm is optimised for accents present in the study area (southern part of the city of Dunedin, New Zealand). Procedure =Caverphone 1.0= The rules of the algorithm are applied consecutively to any particular name, as a series of replacements. The algorithm is as follows: # Convert to lowercase # Remove anything not A-Z # If the name starts with... ## cough, replace it by cou2f ## rough, replace it by rou2f ## tough, replace it by tou2f ## enough, replace it by enou2f ## gn, replace it by 2n # If the name ends with ## mb, replace it by m2 # Replace ## cq with 2q ## ci with si ## ce with se ## cy with sy ## tch with 2ch ## c with k ## q with k ## x with k ## v with f ## dg with 2g ## tio with sio ## tia with sia ## d with t ## ph with fh ## b with p ## sh with s2 ## z with s ## any initial vowel with an A ## all other vowels with a 3 ## 3gh3 with 3kh3 ## gh with 22 ## g with k ## groups of the letter s with a S ## groups of the letter t with a T ## groups of the letter p with a P ## groups of the letter k with a K ## groups of the letter f with a F ## groups of the letter m with a M ## groups of the letter n with a N ## w3 with W3 ## wy with Wy ## wh3 with Wh3 ## why with Why ## w with 2 ## any initial h with an A ## all other occurrences of h with a 2 ## r3 with R3 ## ry with Ry ## r with 2 ## l3 with L3 ## ly with Ly ## l with 2 ## j with y ## y3 with Y3 ## y with 2 # remove all ## 2 ## 3 # put six 1 on the end # take the first six characters as the code =Caverphone 2.0= #Start with a word #Convert to lowercase #Remove anything not in the standard alphabet (typically a-z) #Remove final e #If the name starts with ##cough make it cou2f ##rough make it rou2f ##tough make it tou2f ##enough make it enou2f ##trough make it trou2f ##gn make it 2n #If the name ends with ##mb make it m2 #Replace ##cq with 2q ##ci with si ##ce with se ##cy with sy ##tch with 2ch ##c with k ##q with k ##x with k ##v with f ##dg with 2g ##tio with sio ##tia with sia ##d with t ##ph with fh ##b with p ##sh with s2 ##z with s ##an initial vowel with an A ##all other vowels with a 3 ##j with y ##an initial y3 with Y3 ##an initial y with A ##y with 3 ##3gh3 with 3kh3 ##gh with 22 ##g with k ##groups of the letter s with a S ##groups of the letter t with a T ##groups of the letter p with a P ##groups of the letter k with a K ##groups of the letter f with a F ##groups of the letter m with a M ##groups of the letter n with a N ##w3 with W3 ##wh3 with Wh3 ##if the name ends in w replace the final w with 3 ##w with 2 ##an initial h with an A ##all other occurrences of h with a 2 ##r3 with R3 ##if the name ends in r replace the final r with 3 ##r with 2 ##l3 with L3 ##if the name ends in l replace the final l with 3 ##l with 2 #remove all 2s #if the name end in 3, replace the final 3 with A #remove all 3s #put ten 1s on the end #take the first ten characters as the code \\\\---- Examples =Caverphone 1.0= Lee -> lee lee -> l33 l33 -> L33 L33 -> L L -> L111111 L111111 -> L11111 Thompson -> thompson thompson -> th3mps3n th3mps3n -> th3mpS3n th3mpS3n -> Th3mpS3n Th3mpS3n -> Th3mPS3n Th3mPS3n -> Th3MPS3n Th3MPS3n -> Th3MPS3N Th3MPS3N -> T23MPS3N T23MPS3N -> TMPSN TMPSN111111 -> TMPSN1 =Caverphone 2.0= Lee -> lee lee -> le le -> l3 l3 -> L3 L3 -> LA LA -> LA1111111111 LA1111111111 -> LA11111111 Thompson -> thompson thompson -> th3mps3n th3mps3n -> th3mpS3n th3mpS3n -> Th3mpS3n Th3mpS3n -> Th3mPS3n Th3mPS3n -> Th3MPS3n Th3MPS3n -> Th3MPS3N Th3MPS3N -> T23MPS3N T23MPS3N -> TMPSN TMPSN1111111111 -> TMPSN11111 See also * Soundex * New York State Identification and Intelligence System * Match rating approach * Metaphone * Cologne phonetics References External links * Caversham Project - Caversham data set of names and accents in the southern part of Dunedin, New Zealand in 1893-1938. * Original (2002) Caverphone algorithm * Revised (2004) Caverphone algorithm * Implementations: ** C# Revised Implementation ** Java implementation in the Apache Commons Codec project ** PHP implementation ** Python Implementation caverphone algorithm (version 2.0) - AdvaS Advanced Search project Category:Phonetic algorithms ","title":"Caverphone"},{"id":"4838193","text":"Hainablak Glacier is a glacier near Trango Tower mountain in Baltistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan.

Hot blast furnace: note the flow of air from the stove in the background to the two blast furnaces, and hot air from the foreground furnace being drawn off to heat the stove. Hot blast refers to the preheating of air blown into a blast furnace or other metallurgical process. As this considerably reduced the fuel consumed, hot blast was one of the most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. Hot blast also allowed higher furnace temperatures, which increased the capacity of furnaces. As first developed, it worked by alternately storing heat from the furnace flue gas in a firebrick-lined vessel with multiple chambers, then blowing combustion air through the hot chamber. This is known as regenerative heating. Hot blast was invented and patented for iron furnaces by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland, but was later applied in other contexts, including late bloomeries. Later the carbon monoxide in the flue gas was burned to provide additional heat. History =Invention and spread= James Beaumont Neilson, previously foreman at Glasgow gas works, invented the system of preheating the blast for a furnace. He found that by increasing the temperature of the incoming air to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, he could reduce the fuel consumption from 8.06 tons to 5.16 tons [per what?] with further reductions at even higher temperatures.W.K.V. Gale, British iron and steel industry (David and Charles, Newton Abbot 1967), 55-8. He, with partners including Charles Macintosh, patented this in 1828. Initially the heating vessel was made of wrought iron plates, but these oxidized, and he substituted a cast iron vessel. On the basis of a January 1828 patent, Thomas Botfield has a historical claim as the inventor of the hot blast method. Neilson is credited as inventor of hot blast, because he won patent litigation. Neilson and his partners engaged in substantial litigation to enforce the patent against infringers. The spread of this technology across Britain was relatively slow. By 1840, 58 ironmasters had taken out licenses, yielding a royalty income of ¬£30,000 per year. By the time the patent expired there were 80 licenses. In 1843, just after it expired, 42 of the 80 furnaces in south Staffordshire were using hot blast, and uptake in south Wales was even slower.C.K. Hyde, Technological change and the British iron industry 1700-1870 (Princeton University Press, 1977), 154-5. Other advantages of hot blast were that raw coal could be used instead of coke. In Scotland, the relatively poor \\"black band\\" ironstone could be profitably smelted. It also increased the daily output of furnaces. In the case of Calder ironworks from 5.6 tons per day in 1828 to 8.2 in 1833, which made Scotland the lowest cost steel producing region in Britain in the 1830s.C.K. Hyde, Technological change and the British iron industry 1700-1870 (Princeton University Press, 1977), 151. Early hot blast stoves were troublesome, as thermal expansion and contraction could cause breakage of pipes. This was somewhat remedied by supporting the pipes on rollers. It was also necessary to devise new methods of connecting the blast pipes to the tuyeres, as leather could not longer be used.W.K.V. Gale, The Black Country iron industry (David and Charles, Newton Abbot 1966), 71-5. Ultimately this principle was applied even more efficiently in regenerative heat exchangers, such as the Cowper stove (which preheat incoming blast air with waste heat from flue gas; these are used in modern blast furnaces), and in the open hearth furnace (for making steel) by the Siemens-Martin process.W.K.V. Gale, British iron and steel industry (David and Charles, Newton Abbot 1967), 98-100. Independently, George Crane and David Thomas, of the Yniscedwyn Works in Wales, conceived of the same idea, and Crane filed for a British patent in 1836. They began producing iron by the new process on February 5, 1837. Crane subsequently bought Gessenhainer's patent and patented additions to it, controlling the use of the process in both Britain and the US. While Crane remained in Wales, Thomas moved to the US on behalf of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company and founded the Lehigh Crane Iron Company to utilize the process. =Anthracite in ironmaking= Hot blast allowed the use of anthracite in iron smelting. It also allowed use of lower quality coal because less fuel meant proportionately less sulfur and ash. At the time the process was invented, good coking coal was only available in sufficient quantities in Great Britain and western Germany, so iron furnaces in the US were using charcoal. This meant that any given iron furnace required vast tracts of forested land for charcoal production, and generally went out of blast when the nearby woods had been felled. Attempts to use anthracite as a fuel had ended in failure, as the coal resisted ignition under cold blast conditions. In 1831, Dr. Frederick W. Gessenhainer filed for a US patent on the use of hot blast and anthracite to smelt iron. He produced a small quantity of anthracite iron by this method at Valley Furnace near Pottsville, Pennsylvania in 1836, but due to breakdowns and his illness and death in 1838, he was not able to develop the process into large-scale production. Anthracite was displaced by coke in the US after the Civil War. Coke was more porous and able to support the heavier loads in the vastly larger furnaces of the late 19th century. Steel For steel the hot blast temperature can be from 900 ¬∞C to 1300 ¬∞C (1600 ¬∞F to 2300 ¬∞F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000 ¬∞C to 2300 ¬∞C (3600 ¬∞F to 4200 ¬∞F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level (near the base) to combine with the coke to release additional energy which is necessary to increase productivity.

These letters were personal in nature, and were delivered folded and sealed, so that only the recipient could read their contents. This type of letter contrasts with the better-known letters patent. It was necessary to break the seal to open and read the letter, and so its arrival with the seal intact showed that it had not been intercepted or tampered with. However, once the seal was broken, it could no longer confirm the authenticity of the document. In the Kingdom of England In this realm the letters could be issued by the monarch or government. The original charters of Edward the Confessor can be considered to be a form of letters close, as they were delivered wrapped, with the seal hanging down. This type of letter later developed into the formal business letters that we are familiar with today. It is thought that the earliest surviving English instance remaining unopened dates to the reign of Henry VIII. In England these letters are typical of those generated by the developing state bureaucracy. From 1204, copies of English letters close transcribed onto the Close Rolls are extant. However, examples of actual letters close, as opposed to the recorded copies in the Close Rolls, are extremely rare, and most of those exist because King Henry II required the return of some to the government. Over time, however, as new document series emerged, the scope of the Close Rolls narrowed; and after 1533 their contents consisted solely of copies of private deeds and awards of enclosure, and the like.S.

Memorial was built in 1934-1938 on the place where an unknown Serbian World War I soldier was buried. It is similar to many other tombs of the unknown soldier built by the allies after the war. The ≈Ωrnov fortress was previously located on the same place.  Origin  Avala in October 1915, when the unknown soldier was killed On the night of 13/14 October 1915, Combined squad of the Belgrade's Defense, held the line Avala-Zuce, defending it from the joint Austro-Hungarian and German offensive. Austro-Hungarian 9th Hill brigade of the 59th Division took the front rim of Avala on 16 October, with an assignment to push Serbian forces from the mountain. Austro-Hungarians were reinforced with one German half- battalion. However, one Serbian battalion successfully defended the top of Avala against the Austro-Hungarian battalions of the 49th and 84th regiments, aided by the 204th German reserve infantry regiment. On the same day, the command of the Belgrade's Defense ordered the retreat to the new positions so on 17 October occupational forces reached the southern section of Avala, conquering the entire mountain. Their soldiers then buried Serbian combatants who were killed in action. In the valley, below ≈Ωrnov, on the grave of one of them, they placed a wooden cross with the inscription in German: \\"One unknown Serbian soldier\\".  Predecessor  In the late 1920, a popular news topic in Serbia was the burial of the French \\"unknown soldier\\" in Panth√©on. As the French influence was very strong on Serbian army since the mid-19th century, the idea of doing the same spread among the veterans and social associations, reaching the National Assembly. Existing commemorative cross from 1915 was known only locally and to the Avala visitors. In the first half of 1921 the initiative to build a more dignified commemorative mark gained momentum. On 24 June 1921, president of the Constitutional Assembly, Ivan Ribar, summoned state dignitaries to the meeting with the agenda of constructing the monument. Present at the meeting, among others, were the general and the former defense minister Mihailo Ra≈°iƒá, Rector of the University of Belgrade Bogdan Gavriloviƒá, mayor of Belgrade Dobra Mitroviƒá and manager of the National Theatre in Belgrade Milan Grol. It was decided that the future monument will be \\"dignified...but humble\\". First step was to determine whether it was indeed a Serbian soldier in the grave under the wooden cross. An exhumation was conducted by the commission on 23 November 1921. Parts of the grenade are found under the skull, almost as a pillow, while the skeleton had the blown left side of the chest, so it is estimated that he was killed by the Austro- Hungarian howitzer while he was watching from the lookout. He was apparently buried in the crater formed by the explosion of the very grenade that killed him. Other objects found in the grave include: parts of the military blouse, Serbian bandolier (belt with fi≈°eklijas, the powder pockets, full of ammunition), knapsack, military boots with telephone wires instead of the shoe laces, a wallet with three coins: two 1904 Serbian coins of 2 dinars, with the profile of King Peter I of Serbia, and one coin of 1 groschen (that is, 20 paras from 1912) and a piece of paper, barely recognizable, which is suspected to be a 10 dinars banknote from 1908. The soldier had no identity badge which suggests that he was either member of the Third Call regiments (with soldiers over 38 years old) or was drafted immediately prior to the battle which is probably correct as the skeletal remains pointed out to a very young male, no older than 19-20 years. Some sources actually claim he was only 15. It was said that his skull was \\"small, like of a boy\\" and that skeleton was petite, of a boyish, thin stature. The ammunition was Russian (Tula Arms Plant, 1906), , which means that he used the riffle Mosin‚ÄìNagant M1891. The boots were American, M-1910, mostly distributed to the members of the Personnel department and, to the lesser extent, to the regiments of the First Call (which drafted the youngest soldiers, up to 31 years old). The commission concluded that the remains do belong to the Serbian soldier and reburied him, with the grenade parts, while his personal belongings were taken to the cabinet of the president of the assembly for safekeeping. Assembly Board organized many events in 1922 in order to gather the funding for the monument, but also used the other means for the promotional purposes, like the cinema shows. Also, some more prominent events are used, like the Christmas money collecting by the Patriarch Dimitrije or the wedding of King Alexander I and Queen Maria on 8 June 1922. Not having much faith in the politicians and expecting that they would drag the process, local administration organized the construction in 1922. As the railway was being built in the area (Topƒçider- Mala Krsna), the Yugoslav Railways donated all the needed materials. When the Board found out that the locals are building their own monument, conceptually completely different from their idea, Ivan Ribar held talks with the local administration and an agreement was reached that this monument will be a \\"temporary solution\\". The monument was built near the place where an earlier monument to the unknown soldier was built. It was projected by Milan Miniƒá and the construction began on 1 April 1922. The monument was built by the local villagers, aided by the engineers and workers from the Rakovica railway section. The monument was finished on 14 May 1922 and publicly dedicated on 1 June 1922. The base was a two-leveled square pedestal with a regular, four- sided pyramid made of the roughly dressed stone. The base of the pyramid was and it was tall. Four jardini√®res were leaned on each side of the pyramid, with the seedlings of the common box. They were hexagonally shaped and also made of the roughly dressed stone. On top of the pyramid a six-armed cross was placed. On the eastern side of the pedestal a plate was placed with the inscription: \\"To the fallen heroes in the wars for liberation and unification 1912-1918, this monument is erected by the thankful people of the Vraƒçar District. Consecrated on 1 June 1922\\". On the other three side the inscriptions simply said \\"cross (made) of Carrara marble\\". On the western side of the horizontal arm of the cross another inscription read: \\"Unknown Serbian soldier confirmed by the commission on 29 November 1921\\". The monument was encircled by 16 short stone pillars, 4 on each side, connected with chains. Remains of the unknown soldier were placed in the metal coffin and walled in the monument, together with the small wooden case in the colors of the Serbian flag containing the grenade parts, and remains of another three unidentified soldiers which were discovered in the foothills of Avala. Among the dignitaries at the dedication of the monument were Ivan Ribar, other senior politicians from the Assembly, presidents of the surrounding municipalities and districts and several government ministers. King Alexander visited the location later that same day. On 28 June 1938, when the new monument was finished, the remains of the unknown soldier were taken from the old coffin, washed in white wine, wrapped in white linen and placed in the new metal coffin which was moved to the crypt inside the new monument. Remains of the other three soldiers were placed in the memorial ossuary in Belgrade Fortress. Personal belongings of the soldier were handed over to the Military Museum, also on the Fortress, but they disappeared later. The old monument was completely demolished, except for the six-armed cross which was moved to the churchyard of the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene in Beli Potok, where it is still located.  Monument  The tomb of the Unknown Hero inside the monument View from the Avala TV Tower = History = The construction of the new monument was ordered by King Alexander to commemorate the victims of the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913) and the World War I (1914-1918). The monument was designed by Croatian sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, and the main engineer was Stevan ≈Ωivanoviƒá. Members of the Yugoslav Royal Army and Navy took part in processing and mounting the blocks. King Alexander I of Yugoslavia laid the foundation stone for the new monument on 28 June 1934, just few months before he was assassinated in Marseilles. Before the construction of the new monument started in 1934, the ancient fortified town of ≈Ωrnov was located atop the Avala mountain. It was then demolished by dynamite to free the space for the new monument. The building of the new monument wasn't without the controversy. Public was against the demolition of the old ≈Ωrnov town, while the especially vocal was the author Branislav Nu≈°iƒá. He also protested that the monument is so distant from Belgrade, which would prevent the citizens to pay their respect. Nu≈°iƒá wrote: \\"to Avala go only the wealthy men who have cars, bringing their mistresses with them\\". However, King Alexander was adamant that the monument has to be built on Avala, stating \\"either there or nowhere\\", while Nu≈°iƒá proposed one of the central city squares, Republic Square, close to the modern Staklenac shopping center. Ironically, on that section of the square, today known as the Plateau of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá, actually the monument to Branislav Nu≈°iƒá was erected. The Monument to the Unknown Hero was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1987, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. The surrounding area around the monument was landscaped in 2006. The decorative lights were out of use since the early 1990s. Reconstruction of the light system is to be finished in late February 2019. Over 100 lanterns will be placed around the monument, access paths and the plateau surrounding the monument. Of those, 14 are reflectors lighting the monument itself. They are arranged based on the original project by Me≈°troviƒá. Following his ideas from 1938, the poles will be decorated later in the year, to resemble the burning torch-shaped candelabra. = Design = The monument is in the form of a sarcophagus made of black granite from Jablanica. The sarcophagus in surrounded by caryatids representing all the peoples of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. They represent Bosnian, Montenegrin, Dalmatian, Croatian, Slovenian, Vojvodina‚Äôs, Serbian and South Serbian women. The top of the sarcophagus is marked with an inscription reading \\"Alexander I King of Yugoslavia to the Unknown Hero\\". The monument is high, and in length, while the stairs from the approaching side are long. The tomb with the remains of the unknown hero is located in the crypt (underground room) in the base of the monument. The tomb is marked only by the date \\"1912-1918\\", the duration of the Balkan Wars and World War I. Stairs to the monument There is also a deeper symbolism of the complex. The monument is placed on the five-step pyramid, which symbolizes five centuries of Ottoman occupation of Serbia. Caryatids actually represent mothers of the fallen soldiers, who are keeping the peace and sanctity of the burial place. The monument is also one of the rare such venues which is located outside of the town center. King Alexander wanted to transform the top of the Avala into the replica of the Kajmakƒçalan mountain which gained almost mythical importance after the 1916 Battle of Kaymakchalan between Serbia and Bulgaria, and was euphemistically called \\"Gate of the Homeland\\" or the \\"Altar of the Motherland\\". The monument was to represent the relocated commemorative chapel from Kajmakƒçalan and even plants which grow on that mountain, or resemble it, were planted around the monument. During the 1934-1938 period when the monument was built, the surrounding area was also forested with the specific species of conifers. They were specifically ordered from the botanical garden in Munich, Germany. A certain number of trees was donated to Yugoslavia personally by Adolf Hitler.  Controversies  Some historians consider the terminology used for the complex erroneous. Instead of the monument, word tomb should be used instead: Tomb of the Unknown Hero. = Identity speculation = Based on the examination in 1921 and the properties discovered, it wasn't possible to identify the soldier or even to conclude in which unit he served. Several historians from Belgrade and Sarajevo have claimed that the unknown hero is a Bosniak named Sulejman Baliƒá, a soldier from Duga Poljana, a town between Novi Pazar and Sjenica, that fought in the Serbian army against Austria-Hungary. But as the evidence suggest, the soldier was drafted immediately prior to the battle in October 1915, as he didn't receive the ID badge, so this claim is unlikely. = Conspiracy theories = Hastiness by which the ≈Ωrnov was demolished and king Alexander's insisting on building the monument on this location despite all the opposition, in time influenced numerous conspiracy theories. Conspiracies were the basis of the second season of Shadows over Balkan TV series in 2019-2020. One of the main theories is that the monument is a Masonic temple. Reasons include suspected Masonic membership of both the king Alexander and Me≈°troviƒá, and silver hammer which the king used to mark the beginning of the works. However, silver tools were used for the same purpose by the medieval Serbian rulers, so as by the king Milan who used a silver hammer when the construction of the Belgrade Main railway station began in 1881. Also, nothing in the memorial complex points to the worship function. The monument's form actually strikingly resembles the Tomb of Cyrus, built for Cyrus the Great in ancient Pasargadae, in the 6th century BC.  Ceremonies  The monument is used for the official commemorations of the important historic dates. The President, Prime Minister and other officials visit the monument for the wreath-laying ceremony on dates like the Statehood Day (15 February), Victory Day (9 May), and 15 September, the date when the Macedonian front was broken through in 1918.

The Soviet forces captured East Karelia and Viborg/Viipuri. After that, however, the fighting reached a stalemate. The operations of the strategic offensive can be divided into the following offensives: * Viipuri (10‚Äì20 June) by the Leningrad Front * Virojoki- Lappeenranta (21 June ‚Äì 15 July) by the Leningrad Front ** Koivisto landing (20‚Äì25 June) by the Baltic Fleet * Svir‚ÄìPetrozavodsk (21 June ‚Äì 9 August) by the Karelian Front ** Tuloksa landing (23‚Äì27 June) by the Soviet Ladoga Flotilla Background In January 1944, Soviet forces raised the Siege of Leningrad and drove the German Army Group North back to the Narva-Lake Ilmen- Pskov line. Finland asked for peace conditions in February, but the Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta) considered the terms received impossible to fulfill. After Finland had rejected the peace conditions, and Germany halted the Soviet advance,Newton (1995) the Stavka (Main Command of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union) started to prepare for an offensive to force Finland's exit from the war.Gilbert, p. 536\\" The Plan In order to destroy the Finnish Army and to push Finland out of the war, the Stavka decided to conduct the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive. The strategy called for a two-pronged offensive, one from Leningrad via Viborg to the Kymi river, and the second across the Svir River through Petrozavodsk and Sortavala past the 1940 border, preparing for an advance deep into Finland.Platonov (1964) The plan called for the Finnish army to be destroyed on the Karelian Isthmus, and the remains blocked against the western shore of Lake Ladoga between the two assaults and Lake Saimaa.Zolotarev (1999), pp. 97‚Äì98 Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. –ù–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≤–æ–π—Å–∫ –Ω–∞ –ö–∞—Ä–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ—à–µ–π–∫–µ –∏ –≤ –Æ–∂–Ω–æ–π –ö–∞—Ä–µ–ª–∏–∏ –ü–æ –∑–∞–º—ã—Å–ª—É –°—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏ –ö–∞—Ä–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏ —Å–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–∏ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ë–∞–ª—Ç–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç–∞, –õ–∞–¥–æ–∂—Å–∫–æ–π –∏ –û–Ω–µ–∂—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç–∏–ª–∏–π –º–æ—â–Ω—ã–º–∏ —É–¥–∞—Ä–∞–º–∏ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –±—ã–ª–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–≥—Ä–æ–º–∏—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞, –æ–≤–ª–∞–¥–µ—Ç—å –í—ã–±–æ—Ä–≥–æ–º, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–∑–∞–≤–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–º –∏ –≤—ã–π—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É–±–µ–∂ –¢–∏–∫—à–µ–æ–∑–µ—Ä–æ, –°–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–≤–∞–ª–∞, –ö–æ—Ç–∫–∞. –û–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—é –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–ª–∏ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–∞, –∑–∞—Ç–µ–º –≤ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª –ö–∞—Ä–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç. Finnish defensive positions. The Soviet offensive was stopped at the VKT-line. The main strategic objectives of the offensive were to push Finnish forces away from the north of Leningrad, to drive Finland out of the war,Glantz (2002), pp. 443, 458 and to create better conditions for a major offensive to the south against Germany.Gebhardt (1989), p. 2Glantz (1998), pp. 201‚Äì03Erickson (1993), pp. 329‚Äì30Moisala (1988) The Finnish army had been preparing defensive fortifications since 1940, and three lines of defence on the Karelian Isthmus. The first two were the \\"Main line\\", which was constructed along the frontline of 1941, and the VT-line (Vammelsuu-Taipale) running 20 km behind the main line. These lines were reinforced with numerous concrete fortifications, but the work was still ongoing. The third line, the VKT-line (Viipuri-Kuparsaari-Taipale) was still on the drawing board and the construction of the fortifications began in late May 1944 at the Viborg sector of the line. At the northern bank of the Svir River () the Finnish army had prepared a defence in depth area which was fortified with strong-points with concrete pillboxes, barbed wire, obstacles and trenches. After the Winter War, the Salpa Line was built behind the 1940 border with concrete bunkers in front of the Kymi river. To overcome these obstacles, the Stavka assigned 11 divisions and 9 tank and assault gun regiments to the Leningrad Front. That meant that there were 19 divisions, 2 division strength fortified regions, 2 tank brigades, 14 tank and assault gun regiments at the Isthmus, all of which included over 220 artillery and rocket launcher batteries (almost 3,000 guns/launchers). Around 1,500 planes from the 13th Air Army and the Baltic Fleet naval aviation also contributed to the operation which included surface and naval infantry units of the Baltic Fleet. To the east of Karelia, the Stavka planned to use 9 divisions, 2 sapper brigades, 2 tank brigades and 3 assault gun regiments, raising the whole strength to 16 divisions, 2 fortified regions, 5 separate rifle brigades, 2 tank brigades, 3 assault gun regiments and 3 tank battalions. They were supported by Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega naval flotillas and the 7th Air Army. Vyborg Offensive At the Karelian Isthmus front there were on average 120 Red Army artillery pieces for every kilometer of frontline, with up to 220 artillery pieces per kilometer on the breakthrough sector at Valkeasaari. In addition to heavy coastal artillery of the Leningrad area and the guns of the capital ships of the Baltic Fleet (Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya, , ) Stavka had also assigned heavy siege artillery (280 to 305 mm) in support of the attack. On June 9, a day before the main Soviet offensive, the 1,600-strong 13th Air Army conducted a major aerial assault. At the same time, artillery units of the Leningrad Front and the Baltic Fleet shelled Finnish positions for 10 hours. The Finnish Army was in a well-fortified position, but the Soviet air attacks surprised the defending Finnish army and undermined its resistance causing many Finnish units to retreat and suffer from thousands of desertions.Bergstrom (2008) =Valkeasaari= Memorial in Kalelovo IS-2 heavy tank moving through forest On June 10, the Soviet 21st Army spearheaded by 30th Guards Corps opened the offensive on the Valkeasaari sector which was defended by 1st Infantry Regiment of Finnish 10th Division. During the day, the Soviet units captured frontline trenches and destroyed fortifications, shattering the first Finnish defense line at the breakthrough sector. =Kuuterselk√§= Map of the battle of Kuuterselka On June 13, the Soviet 21st Army's offensive reached the partially completed VT-line. The defensive position was breached at Kuuterselk√§ by June 15. Though the line was breached the Finnish resistance managed to delay further Soviet advances. =Siiranm√§ki= Memorial in Siiranm√§ki Simultaneous to Kuuterselk√§ the Soviet 23rd Army attempted to break through at a perceived weak point in the Finnish VT-line at Siiranm√§ki. Siiranm√§ki was the first place where Finnish troops were able to use Panzerfausts and Panzerschrecks imported from Germany. Though Finnish troops managed to contain the Soviet breakthrough at Siiranm√§ki it was not enough to keep the VT-line as Kuuterselk√§ had already been breached. Soviet 98th Infantry Corps fighting in Siiranm√§ki against Finnish 7th Regiment announced to have lost during period of June 13 to June 16: 3 784 soldiers including 887 killed in action based on their own report. Red Army and especially Guard units took heavy losses in Siiranm√§ki-Kuuterselk√§ with 20,000 KIA, MIA or WIA. =Viborg= The Finnish army attempted to buy time by engaging in delaying actions during its retreat so that additional forces from East Karelia would be able to reach the front, and the VKT-line could be prepared for combat. However, on June 19 forces of the first Leningrad Front had reached Viborg, and the first phase of the offensive was completed by the capture of the city on June 20, when the defending Finnish 20th Infantry Brigade fled in panic. Though Leningrad Front had managed to capture Viborg within the time table set by Stavka they had been unable to prevent retreating Finnish units from regrouping and fortifying on the VKT-line. Unlike many battles on the Eastern Front in the Karelian Isthmus the Red Army was unable to trap any large Finnish units ‚Äì not even a single battalion. Finnish forces had managed to retreat. At the same time more and more Finnish reserves were arriving at the VKT-defense line, where terrain was much more favorable for defenders than for the armored Red Army units. The Soviet 21st Army also faced logistics issues after its fast 120 km advance to west. Virojoki-Lappeenranta Offensive Mannerheim had asked for German help, and on June 17 Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey arrived in Finland, followed on June 21 by the 303rd Assault Gun Brigade (at half strength) and the 122nd Infantry Division. Also, new German anti-tank weapons, Panzerfausts and Panzerschrecks, were issued to Finnish army troops. Late on June 21, German foreign minister von Ribbentrop arrived to Finland in an attempt to extract political concessions from the military help. On June 21, Stavka ordered continued attacks on the Imatra-Lappeenranta-Virojoki defence line, on the Salpa Line sector of the front. Another group would attack northwards to K√§kisalmi (now Priozersk, Russia) and surround the Finns defending the eastern VKT-line while preparations would be made for an advance towards Kotka, Kouvola and the Kymi river. On June 21 the Finnish government asked for Soviet peace terms. The response arrived on the next day and it demanded Finnish capitulation before any conditions could be presented. This created confusion in the Finnish government, where Ryti and Tanner were willing to repeat the inquiry about the conditions, while others opposed the capitulation. During the meeting Marshal Mannerheim was called, and he stated that the Soviet demand constituted an unconditional surrender. When Paasikivi's negotiation trip to Moscow in March 1944, which was initiated by the Soviet ambassador in Stockholm, but turned out to be a Soviet dictation of terms,Moisala & Alanen (1988) pp. 58‚Äì59, 66‚Äì67Lunde (2011) pp. 259‚Äì60 was remembered, the government decided to interpret the Soviet response as a demand for unconditional surrender.Lunde (2011) p. 302 It seemed that after Finnish unwillingness to accept the Soviet proposals in April 1944, owing to excessive reparation demands, Finland was to be offered only unconditional surrender.Lunde (2011) p. 270 This was in line with Churchill's statement that as an Axis belligerent, Finland's surrender must be unconditional.Jowett, P., Snodgrass, B. (2006). Finland at War 1939‚Äì45. Osprey Publishing. The Soviet authorities denied this interpretation in an article published in Pravda on July 2, 1944,Dagens Nyheter, July 3, 1944Svenska Dagbladet, July 3, 1944 Furthermore, it is also known that at June 26 Stalin even told American ambassador Harriman that US diplomats could try to clarify to the Finns that he did not intend to take over the country. An unsigned draft document called \\"The Terms for Finnish Unconditional Surrender\\" was found in October 1993 in the Russian Foreign Ministry archive, which led some historians to conclude that unconditional surrender was indeed the Soviet goal.Turtola (2001), p. 168, Dr. Turtola discovered a Soviet draft for \\"The Unconditional Surrender of Finland\\" from the Russian Foreign Ministry archive in Moscow, dated June 1944. Here are the relevant passages from the document: \\"The Finnish Government and the Supreme Command of the Defence Forces acknowledge the complete defeat of the Finnish Armed Forces in the war against the U.S.S.R. and announce the unconditional surrender of Finland, requesting the cessation of acts of war.\\"; \\"5. As this document takes effect, the Finnish Government and the Supreme Command of the Finnish Defence Forces commit themselves without delay in calling to Finland all Finnish troops on other fronts and in disarming them.\\"; \\"7. The Supreme Command of the Finnish Defence Forces will carry out the disarming of all Finnish land, air, and naval forces according to the orders, schedule, and sequence given by the Supreme Command of the Soviet Military Forces, under its supervision. 8. Since the moment of signing this document until when the Supreme Command of the Soviet Military Forces has taken under its control all communications connections in Finland, all radio broadcasts in Finnish territory are forbidden, and Finnish telegraph, telephone, and radio connections to other countries will be cut off. 9. The Finnish Government and the Supreme Command of the Finnish Defence Forces will secure the transportation of military troops of the U.S.S.R. in Finnish territory by rail and by other means of transportation and the needed supplies to the troops. 10. To fulfill the terms of surrender and to secure the interests of the U.S.S.R., the Supreme Command of the Soviet Military Forces ‚Äì by its own military forces and at its own discretion ‚Äì will occupy partially or fully the territory of Finland, her harbours, the archipelago of √Öland, and the islands of the Gulf of Finland. The Government of the U.S.S.R. will make use of all the rights of an occupying power in the occupied territories of Finland. The Supreme Command of the Soviet Military Forces will publish its own orders and directives. The Finnish Government and the Finnish people will by all means try to contribute to the execution of these orders and directives. To serve this aim, the Finnish Government will without delay give an order to all the authorities of the central and local government, to the judicial system, public organisations, and all civil servants to remain in their previous positions, to obey orders unconditionally, and to carry out their duties conscientiously, until the Supreme Command of the Soviet Military Forces gives its directives.\\" According to Baryshnikov this and similar drafts for the other countries the USSR was at war with existed since 1943, and they were replaced by new ones in the summer of 1944.Baryshnikov (2006) With Finnish army reinforcements, there were 268,000 Finnish army troops with 2,350 guns (of which 1,030 field artillery, 393 heavy mortars), 110 tanks/assault guns and 250 planes facing the two Red Army Fronts; 40% of the men and guns, and all the tanks were on the Isthmus. In total, the Red Army had a 1.7:1 advantage in men, 5.2:1 advantage in guns, and 6‚Äì7:1 advantage in planes and tanks against the Finnish army. However Finnish forces with 14 infantry divisions (a' 13,200), one armour division (9,200), 5 infantry brigades (a' 6,700), one cavalry regiment (4,300), 7 independent front border jaeger battalions, coastal defence forces and HQ/Corps artillery units even with full strength had less than 230,000 men. Less than 40 Finnish tanks and assault guns were modern (StuG III, T-34, KV-1) and less than 60 aircraft too (Bf 109 dayfighter and Ju 88 medium bomber). With these figures Red Army material advantage was about 1:20 at mid June 1944 (armour and aircraft). The offensive continued on June 25, when the Red Army breached the VKT-line at Tali, between the Viborg Bay and the Vuoksi river. On June 26 the Finnish president Ryti gave the guarantee to Ribbentrop that Finland would fight to the end alongside Germany. When it became evident that a breakthrough was not possible at Ihantala, the Leningrad Front attempted to double envelope the defenders with the twin assaults at the Viborg Bay and Vuosalmi. However, the Finnish army was able to hold its positions on these sectors of the front. On July 12 Stavka ordered Leningrad front to release offensive elements from the Finnish front, and on July 15, the Red Army troops were ordered to assume a defensive posture, and offensive elements (mostly armor) were transferred to the German front for use in Operation Bagration. How many Soviet combat forces were really sent from the Karelian Isthmus to other fronts is questionable. Captured reports, strength of Red Army regiments and battalions especially in Ihantala and √Ñyr√§p√§√§ are suggesting heavy losses. Estimated 10 divisions had less than 2 000 soldiers left each which underlined these units had just few soldiers left at battalion level. Losses were heavy especially among Guard Divisions. The Soviet troops tried to penetrate deep west after the Battle of Ihantala: in √Ñyr√§p√§√§ until July 18 and in Karelian Front even in early August. All offensives continued until very end ‚Äì when there was no chance to make final decisive breakthrough. There hardly were any \\"limited objectives\\" in Karelian Isthmus and Karelia. In official history of Great Patriotic War failed offensives usually disappeared to memory whole as it happened to Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodosk Offensives. After Vyborg the plan was to take Kymi river and run Finnish military forces into a bankruptcy when forces in Karelia were trapped. =Koivisto Landing Operation= After the Soviet offensive on the Karelian Isthmus pushed north past Koivisto, the Finnish forces defending the Koivisto Islands (or in Russian : the Beryozovye Islands) became isolated. After the Soviet 21st Army failed to attack the islands, the Leningrad front ordered the Soviet Baltic Fleet to capture the islands. The initial Soviet landing was contained but the Finnish Navy soon evacuated the defending forces. This movement was largely unopposed. Although the eagerness of the commanders to evacuate preserved the defending forces, the loss of the islands proved costly because the Soviet Baltic Fleet gained a safe route to Vyborg Bay. =Tienhaara= After capturing Viborg the lead elements of the Soviet 21st Army attempted to push forward along the main road leading north from Viborg but strong artillery support, narrow area of operations, and very favorable terrain made it possible for the Finnish 61st Infantry Regiment to hold the Soviet advance forcing the Soviet 21st Army to attempt to find a more suitable location for breaching the Finnish VKT-line. =Tali-Ihantala= After Soviet 21st Army easily cleared the defending Finnish troops from Viborg on June 20, the Soviet forces attempted to press on the offensive, but met stubborn Finnish resistance at Tali and were forced to stop. After bringing fresh troops to the front the 21st Army managed to push Finnish lines to Ihantala but failed to create any breakthroughs. The battle fought over the area is considered to be the largest battle in the history of the Nordic countries. The Soviet 23rd Army joined the offensive by attempting to break through the Finnish lines between Tali and Vuoksi towards Noskua but the repeated Soviet attacks were halted by the highly efficient Finnish artillery. In the end the battle of Tali-Ihantala was a defensive strategic victory for the Finnish army. It blocked the possibility for the Soviet army to break through to the Finnish heartland and the road to Helsinki. Soviet military losses peaked on 28 June when Leningrad Front reported that it had lost during that single day over 5,000 soldiers including 1,800 killed in action, over 25% more than on 14 June when they reported losing almost 4,000 (including nearly 700 killed in action). The Finnish artillery caused a high proportion of these losses, concentrating deadly firepower with 250 artillery pieces sending 2,000 shells to one small target area the size of just 6 hectares in one minute. Red Army units saw no chances to penetrate through this fire power. The terrain favored the defenders forcing Soviet armor units into narrow death traps. Finnish radio intelligence intercepted many Red Army signals, giving data for effective artillery and air power counterattacks. =Viborg Bay= After the initial efforts of the 21st Army in Tali-Ihantala did not produce a breakthrough, the Leningrad Front ordered the 59th Army to capture the islands dominating the Viborg Bay and perform an amphibious landing on the opposing shore. Though the landings on the islands were ultimately successful, the attempted crossing failed. =Vuosalmi= As the 21st Army was unable to advance, the Soviet 23rd Army attempted a crossing in the Vuosalmi region of the Vuoksi waterway. Though Soviet forces successfully pushed Finnish troops from √Ñyr√§p√§√§ ridge dominating the crossing and managed to create a strong bridgehead on the opposing side, the defending Finnish troops were able to contain it. Svir‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive The Soviet Union's Karelian Front attacked in the Olonets sector of White Karelia on June 20. Weakened Finnish forces proved unable to stop the offensive which reached Olonets on June 25 and on June 29 took Petrozavodsk, one of the main goals of the operation. The long advance and the delaying tactics of the Finnish forces sapped the Soviet strength and the main push of the 7th Army stopped at the Finnish U-line. The Soviet 7th Army and the 32nd Army tried to go around the U-line attacking further to the north but failed to break through the defending Finnish units in battles fought in the wilderness of Karelia. The last attempt to resume the offensive was made further north by two divisions of the Soviet 32nd Army which were defeated by counterattacking Finns in the battle of Ilomantsi. =Svir= The Finnish Army had previously withdrawn most of its forces from the southern shore of the Svir River, so when the Red Army offensive started on 21 June, it did not achieve the desired surprise. The Karelian Front's Soviet 7th Army ‚Äì 37th Guards, 4th and 99th Corps ‚Äì crossed the river using amphibious vehicles on the following day and secured a bridgehead 8 km deep and 16 km wide. After securing the crossing the Soviet forces continued to chase the withdrawing Finns towards the defenses of the 'PSS'-line. =Tuloksa landing operation= On June 23, 70th naval infantry brigade attacked and captured a beachhead behind the Finnish lines and also beyond the 'PSS'-line between the Viteleenjoki and Tuuloksenjoki rivers, severing the main road and railroad connections along the shore of Lake Ladoga. As Finns had previously moved most of the coastal defenses to the Karelian Isthmus the Soviet landing met only skeleton defense. Finnish attempts to drive the Soviets into the Ladoga proved unsuccessful but it had pushed the defending Soviets to the difficult position as ammunition and supplies started running low. Situation in the beachhead was improved when the 3rd Naval Infantry Brigade started its landings on the evening of June 24. Bad weather hampered the efforts the brigade was finally unloaded on the June 26 and it was able to link up with the advancing 7th Army. Landing caused some trouble for the defending Finns as it cut the railroad line running along the coast of lake Ladoga. Cutting of the road was of less consequence as Finns had already previously constructed new parallel roads further inland in fear of landing. However the heavy traffic of the withdrawing forces totally ruined the new road forcing some of the equipment to be abandoned. Though the Finns managed to withdraw to the new defensive line the advancing Soviet units broke through the new line at Vitele already on June 28 forcing the Finns to continue delaying the advancing Soviets while withdrawing towards the 'U'-line. For the Red Army the Svir‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive cost losses of at least 45,000 soldiers while Finnish losses were 11,000. The Soviets themselves estimated having captured 933 Finnish artillery pieces and 18,000 rounds of ammunition however many of the guns had been spiked.Nenye P.261 =Nietj√§rvi= The Finnish Army retreated further, delaying the Karelian Front's advance, allowing for the U-line, running northwards from Pitk√§ranta to Loimola and Kivij√§rvi, to be reinforced. The first Karelian Front 7th Army's units reached the U-line on July 10, but were fatigued following the long offensive and failed to breach the defence line. Soviet attempts to break through the U-line at Nietj√§rvi ended with clear Soviet failure on July 17 when a Finnish counterattack regained the lost positions on the U-line causing severe losses to the Soviet 114th Division. Once the attempts to gain breakthrough into the Finnish U-line had failed Red Army attempted to go around the line by flanking it through the frontier north of the line. As Finns countered the flanking maneuvers the fighting extended far into the frontier in a makeshift extension of the U-line however Soviet 7th Army managed neither to flank the extending Finnish line nor to break through it. Soviet losses in Nietj√§rvi were 7,000 KIA, MIA and WIA while Finnish forces lost 1,200 soldiers. =Ilomantsi= North of the U-line the Soviet 32nd Army which consisted of 176th, 289th, 313th and 368th Rifle Divisions advanced after capturing Petrozavodsk towards small Finnish town of Ilomantsi while being delayed by defending Finnish 21st Brigade. Lack of suitable roads and the slow progress of 7th Army forced 32nd Army to move 313th and 368th Rifle Divisions to support 7th Army's offensive but they were blocked by the Finnish 1st Division. The Soviet attack towards Ilomantsi with the remaining 2 divisions (176th and 289th) was initially successful, and the divisions reached the border of 1940 on July 21, (the only Soviet units which did so in the offensive), but in the ensuing battle the divisions were surrounded and forced to escape the encirclement suffering heavy losses (est. 7,000-8,000 KIA, MIA, WIA if including losses of last week of July in Ilomantsi area ) and being forced to leave their artillery and other heavy equipment behind.Juutilainen (1994), pp. 145‚Äì47Mannerheim (1952), pp. 459‚Äì60 Aftermath The offensive succeeded in reclaiming East Karelia and driving the Finnish army to the northern side of Viborg Bay and the Vuoksi River. It also reopened the original route of the Murman Railway and the White Sea Canal to the Karelian Front forces. However, the offensive failed to breach the VKT- line and reach the Kymi River as ordered by the Stavka. In fact by the end of summer 1944 the Finnish armed forces were stronger and better equipped than ever before. Despite the losses suffered, the Finnish army managed to avoid encirclement of battalion-size units and benefited from supplies delivered by Germany. Based on documents found after 1991 in Russia the most important point of the plan - the destruction of Finnish forces in Karelian Isthmus in a determined time and reaching a certain line (Kotka) - had failed.Mannerheim (1953), p. 500Ziemke (2002), p. 388 Despite that, the psychological effect of the offensive on the Finnish leadership should not be underestimated. Even though the Finns had stopped the offensive at the Karelian Isthmus after 100 km and the Battle of Ilomantsi had shown that the Finnish army was still a viable fighting force,Mannerheim (1952), p. 484 it was estimated that should the Soviet offensive continue at its full strength, the Finnish army would be able to last for three months at most. For Finland the overall situation required peace especially when Germans had not much chance to keep Finns on their side longer. At the same time western allies had already made their crucial breakthrough in Normandy and were driving fast to the east. During the height of the offensive in June 1944, the Finns asked for negotiations and the Soviets responded with a demand for surrender, which in Finland was interpreted as an ambiguous demand for unconditional surrender and rejected. After the fighting had reached a stalemate in August 1944, another attempt to seek peace was made by Finland. In September 1944 the Soviets offered peace terms that were roughly the same as in April 1944, though some of the demands, which had been seen by the Finns as impossible to concede to, were reduced. The $600 million war reparations were halved and the time to pay them off was extended.Mannerheim (1952), p. 499Mannerheim (1953), p. 509 This was probably in part brought about by international pressure exerted on the Soviets, especially by the U.S. and Britain.Ziemke (2002), p. 390 However, after the ceasefire the Soviets demanded that payments be based on 1938 prices which nearly doubled the actual amount to be paid, and so the Finns complained that the Soviets only pretended to lower the reparations. Despite not achieving all of the goals set by the Stavka, the offensive forced Finland from the war and to accept Soviet peace terms, or at least it was an important factor leading to the ceasefire negotiations that were resumed a month after the offensive had ended.Platonov (1964), p. 486Vehvil√§inen (2002), p. 143 Notes References Bibliography         Finland at War: The Continuation and Lapland Wars 1941-45 by Vesa Nenye, Peter Munter, Toni Wirtanen, and Chris Birks Further reading * Ilya Moshansky: Sturm Karelskogo Vala.

Video podcast of Rees talking about contemporary heterocyclic chemistry Early life and education Rees was born in Egypt, and educated in England at Farnham Grammar School. After three years as a laboratory technician at the Royal Aircraft Establishment he went to University College at Southampton (later the University of Southampton) where he graduated in 1950. He took his PhD there with Professor A. Albert of the Australian National University ‚Äì at Euston Road, London. Career He was then appointed Assistant Lecturer at Birkbeck College, London in 1955 (moving in at the bottom as Professor Derek Barton moved out at the top to take up the Regius Chair in Glasgow). After two years at Birkbeck, Rees moved to King's College London where he spent eight years as Lecturer/Reader. He collaborated for several years with Professor Donald Holroyde Hey on various aspects of heterocyclic chemistry. He was appointed to his first Chair at the University of Leicester in 1965, and four years later moved to the University of Liverpool as Professor of Organic Chemistry, and in 1977 he succeeded Professor George Wallace Kenner there as Heath Harrison Professor of Organic Chemistry. In 1978, he was appointed Hofmann Professor of Organic Chemistry at Imperial College London and remained there until his retirement in 1993. Rees' research interests ranged widely over mechanistic and synthetic organic chemistry. Much of his work was concerned with heterocyclic chemistry, particularly the synthesis and chemistry of new heterocyclic rings, with an emphasis on aromatic and antiaromatic rings, and the role of reactive intermediates in heterocyclic chemistry. Recently, he had been working on heterocyclic systems with unusually high proportions of nitrogen and sulphur heteroatoms. He published about 480 papers in the scientific literature. Rees was the President of the Royal Society of Chemistry from July 1992 for two years. He has served on its Council and many Boards and Committees at various times; he was Chair of the Publication and Information Board for four years. He was President of the Perkin Division of the RSC, and President of the Chemistry Association for the Advancement of Science. Amongst the many and diverse contributions to chemistry he made, his two papers describing the brilliantly conceived generation of benzyne and [1,8]-dehydronaphthalene by the lead(IV) acetate oxidation of N-amino heterocycles are considered classic papers from this era. He died on 21 September 2006 of undisclosed causes. Awards and honours He was the Royal Society of Chemistry's Tilden Lecturer in 1974, and the Pedler Lecturer in 1984, and received the (first) RSC Award in Heterocyclic Chemistry in 1980 and the International award in Heterocyclic Chemistry in 1995. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974. He was awarded an Honorary D.Sc. by the University of Leicester in 1994 and a CBE in the New Years Honours list in 1995.

An illiterate native of Naples or Calabria, his exact origins are unknown, though he hailed from the Kingdom of Naples, and was perhaps of Spanish origin.Jeno de' Cornonei recounted however that he was a native of Tortora. See Giuseppe Guida Amedeo Fulco, Loffredo Editore, Naples, 1982 He fled Naples after having murdered his wife and sought protection at the Gonzaga under Federico II, Duke of Mantua, and in the Republic of Venice. In 1526 he was absolved of the crime of uxoricide by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. He fought the Ottomans in Hungary, and the French in Piedmont. He suffered a grievous setback in the siege he laid to the city of Asti in 1526 where, after having breached the walls by cannon fire for a final assault, legend narrates that victory was snatched from his grasp by the intervention of the town's patron saint, St.Secondus of Asti who is said to have appeared in the sky. Fighting on the imperial side, he took part in the Sack of Rome the following year, and three years later, in the siege of Florence. He gained a reputation as a ruthless mercenary and ravager.  The murder of Francesco Ferrucci  The black name he earned in Italian history and popular memory came from the way he despatched Francesco Ferrucci, the captain of the Florentine army. Maramaldo fought for the Duke of Orange, for the restoration of the Medici, against the army of the Florentine Republic. The two forces clashed in the town of Gavinana on the 3rd. of August 1530, and Maramaldo murdered his old enemy, who had been grievously wounded and taken prisoner, against the principles of chivalrous conduct in wartime.Francis A. Hyett, Florence -Her History and Art to the Fall of the Republic, Methuen & Co., London 1903 pp.518-19 There are many differing accounts of the episode, the incident being much favoured in early historical accounts and fiction. Massimo d'Azeglio in his historical novel reimagined the scene, as recounted by the character Fanfulla, thus:- : > 'The Spaniard who had taken Ferruccio, wished to conceal him, but orders > came from Maramaldo, to conduct him to his presence. Two pikes were crossed, > he was seated upon them and carried to the square... They flung him down at > Maramaldo's feet; he fell with great force, but, however, he raised himself > on one arm, and maintained a front more lofty and daring than ever... > Maramaldo approached him and said, 'You are here at last, poltroon > merchant.' But Ferruccio, disarmed, and disabled, and helpless as he was, > defied him to his face, and called him a liar, and while he was thus > upbraiding the traitor, I saw Maramaldo feel for the handle of his dagger; > he unsheathed it, and held it up in Ferruccio's face... Ferruccio moved not, > he turned not... Twice the blade was plunged into his throat, and, dying, > and the blood spouting from his mouth, he murmured, 'Vile poltroon, you > murder a dead man'.'Massimo d' Azeglio, Niccol√≤ Dei Lapi: Or, The Last Days > of the Florentine Republic,(Niccol√≤ de' Lapi ovvero i Palleschi e i > Piagnoni,1841) tr. H. Hallet J. B. Lippincott and co., 1860 p.354  Maramaldo in the Italian language  The phrase, 'you are killing a dead man', in Italian, tu uccidi un uomo morto, became proverbial. However, there are notable differences in contemporary Renaissance accounts of Ferrucci's last words. The version here is comes from the contemporary historian Benedetto Varchi's History of Florence.Storia Fiorentina, Bk.XI Paolo Giovio, in his Historiarum sui temporis libri XLV,(1550‚Äì1552) has Ferrucci saying, 'If you kill me, you will gain neither profit nor the approbation of praise from my murder'.'tu si me occidas, neque utilem, neque decoram ex mea nece laudem feres'. Historiarum sui temporis libri XLV, Tome 2, Tolentino 1552, p.137 A third minor contemporary source, given in the Tuscan dialect, has Ferrucci say, 'Tu darai a un morto'(You'll be bashing a corpse), which may be more probable.Giuseppe Fumagalli, Chi l'ha detto?: tesoro di citazioni italiane e straniere, di origine letteraria e storica, ordinate e annotate, Hoepli, 1980 pp.228-9, provides the three sources given in the preceding notes Ten days later, Florence surrendered, and was forced to accept the return of the Medici. The feats of the Neapolitan condottiere, particularly this last incident, impressed themselves on the popular imagination, to the point that his name became synonymous with maltreatment of the weak or anyone incapable of defending himself, or for the type of person who shows himself ready to overcome or betray others as soon as he detects some weakness. Thus, in the Italian language, the substantive maramaldo and the adjective maramaldesco (\\"Maramaldesque\\") has become eponymous of \\"ruthless\\", \\"villainous\\". One occasionally comes across the verb, maramaldeggiare in the sense of 'treat someone badly by ruthless mockery''L'Italia √® il paese di Maramaldo, e io non voglio maramaldeggiare su lei,' Adriano Sofri Se Veronica diventa preda, La Repubblica, 1/05/009  References  Category:1494 births Category:1552 deaths Category:Condottieri Category:Military leaders of the Italian Wars Category:15th-century Neapolitan people Category:16th-century Italian people Category:16th-century Neapolitan people ","title":"Fabrizio Maramaldo"},{"id":"4838369","text":"(Charles) John Halswell Kemeys-Tynte, 9th Baron Wharton (12 January 1908 - 22 July 1969).

The New Zealand 3rd Division landed on Nissan Island on 15 February 1944 as part of the Solomon Islands campaign to isolate the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul. Shortly after the landings two airfields were constructed on the island. Richard Nixon was a supply officer on the base, and is remembered as being popular with the indigenous inhabitants. There was also a PT boat base on another island nearby. There were approximately allied troops on the island at that time.

Contrary to the spirit of the time, he was a promoter of tolerance towards the Jewish minority. Biography =Early life= He was born in the village of Dide»ôti, Teleorman County, the son of a wealthy peasant and a priest's daughter. His father had traveled throughout the Balkans on business, and had settled down as an estate lessee.Vianu, p.275 After completing his primary studies in his native village and in Ro»ôiorii de Vede (1888‚Äì1890), he went on to study at the Saint Sava National College in Bucharest (1890‚Äì1898), and, after a period of studying philosophy at the University of Bucharest, took a degree in Theology at Czernowitz University. During the period, Galaction began to take an interest in literature, and was briefly influenced by the ideas of S√¢r P√©ladan, a French occultist and poet.Vianu, p.281 He debuted in 1900 with the novella Moara lui CƒÉlifar (\\"CƒÉlifar's Mill\\"), a sinister story on the subject of demonic temptation; nevertheless, his growing interest in Orthodoxy led him to abandon literature for the following ten years -- his 1914 volume of collected stories, comprising La Vulturi! (one of his most famous pieces of writing), was awarded the Romanian Academy prize.Vianu, p.281-282 =Early 1900s activism= Having spent his early years a disciple of the Marxist philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea,Vianu, p.278 he was partisan of Poporanism and, like his close friend N. D. Cocea, socialismFrunzƒÉ, p.245; Vianu, p.279 \\\\- tendencies which established him as a leading figure on the left wing of the Romanian political spectrum. According to Vianu's later assessment: > \\"The attraction towards socialism during Galaction's youth was always > confessed and never was disavowed, although the religious outlook on life, > formulated through the influence of his family and his immediate > environment, led him to see socialists as fellow travellers rather than > comrades in battle.\\"Vianu, p.278-279 Noted for his criticism of the violent repression of the Romanian Peasants' Revolt in 1907,Vianu, p.292 he soon became an active journalist. With the help of Tudor Arghezi, he edited Cronica and Spicul, which appeared during World War I (between 1915 and 1918). Like his friend Arghezi and others, he displayed his sympathy for the Central Powers, and remained in Bucharest under German occupation, collaborating with the new authorities.Boia, p.256 Eventually, Galaction welcomed the new political mood established by the Russian Revolution (and first manifested in Romania by the activities of the Socialist Party and the strikes of 1918‚Äì1919): > \\"We were given to witness with our own eyes how the old worlds are crumbling > and how the new ones are born. And it seems to me that the spectacle is at > its most interesting as seen from out little Romanian island. [...] The > power of the many, let loose all around us, is rising, is fretting, is > roaring and is looking for a new balance. Let us not delude ourselves by > thinking we could ever see it return to its previous mould. It would be > absurd.\\"Galaction, in Vianu, p.288 At around the same time, he became an enthusiastic advocate of the labor movement. A public meeting of factory workers left a lasting impression on him: > \\"Out of the smoldering and mud-covered suburbs, out of the humid and > suffocating basements, out of the thousands of only too small cells, where > the proletarian bee distills the honey of capitalist drones, out of all > places high and low, the working people had come in black flocks in order to > increase, standing shoulder to shoulder, the phalanx of socialist > demands.\\"Galaction, in Vianu, p.289 Soon after the war, Galaction befriended Nicolae Tonitza, a painter and illustrator of socialist newspapers who produced the cover of Galaction's collection of essays (O lume nouƒÉ) and painted his portrait under the title \\"The Man of a New World\\".Zambaccian In his memoir of the period, the art collector Krikor Zambaccian described the latter as: > \\"that hallucinatory portrait [...]. On a background of intense blue is > profiled the mage-like figure of the writer Galaction; on the most distant > plane emerge the silhouettes of industries and rise up the chimneys of > factories.\\" =Interwar= D. D. PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Panait Istrati and Mihail Sadoveanu. In 1922, he was anointed priest, and in 1926 he became professor of Theology and New Testament Studies at the Chi≈üinƒÉu University Theology School. He was dean of the School between 1928 and 1930. Together with priest Vasile Radu, he worked on a new translation of the Bible into modern Romanian, a work published in 1938, meant as a newer and more accurate version to replace the traditional Cantacuzino Bible. The literary critic Tudor Vianu wrote: > \\"[...] the new translation, accomplished through the means created by newer > literary evolution and with the talent of a modern poet, presents a major > philological and artistic interest.\\"Vianu, p.282-283 During the interwar period, Galaction was also the author of several studies, articles and commentaries on the New Testament, as well as completing a celebrated translation of William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice.Matei- Chesnoiu, p.114 He contributed regularly to Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ and AdevƒÉrul, as well as to SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, but was on exceptionally bad terms with the latter's founder, Nicolae Iorga.TƒÉnase In 1936, he was the subject of a denunciation for \\"communist activities\\" and alleged links with the Comintern, which he dismissed as slander. Nevertheless, in 1938‚Äì1940, Galaction, like other figures on the Poporanist and socialist Left (among them Armand CƒÉlinescu, Petre Andrei, Mihai Ralea, Ioan Fluera»ô, and Mihail Ghelmegeanu), was attracted into collaboration with the fascist-inspired corporatist regime created, as a means to combat the influence of the pro-Nazi Iron Guard, around King Carol II and the National Renaissance Front.Veiga, p.264 Upon the outbreak of the September Campaign and World War II, he wrote: > \\"The war has begun. Hitler the monster or the demigod, the lever of destiny > or the Devil's puppet, has again lifted the banner of death amid the borders > of peoples. Is he the forerunner and the prophet of better times, or the > strix of downfalls and irremediable disasters? Are the Germans fighting for > a better future, or for the narthex of barbarity and for the death of > Europe? This is yet another pathetic scrutiny! Christian peoples turn their > backs on The Calvary, disavow the laws of their upbringing and mock the Nine > Joys! The De-Christianized Germans and the Roman Catholic Poles are equally > vainglorious and lacking in Christian spirit.\\"Galaction, in Dolghin =1940s= The fall of Carol's rule and the establishment of the Iron Guard's National Legionary State saw Galaction's retreat from public life, prolonged after the Legionnaires' Rebellion and the onset of Ion Antonescu's dictatorship. In 1944, as the August 23 coup overthrew Antonescu, taking Romania out of the Axis camp and opening the country to Soviet influence, Galaction expressed his enthusiasm: > \\"The long-awaited hour has arrived during a night when our hearts were being > estinguished with fear and our houses were falling apart... It has arrived > after traveling a long way, passing among ruins, tombs, and smoke-covered > towers... It is here!... Become an epoch, become a century, you long-awaited > hour!\\"Galaction, in Vianu, p.293 Soon after, Galaction began collaborating with the Romanian Communist Party and its various organizations. In 1947, he replaced the purged Nichifor Crainic as a member of the Romanian Academy,MihƒÉilescu; Popescu Gogan and was elected vice-president of the Writers' Union in the same year; Galaction was himself purged from the Academy later in the same year, and readmitted as an honorary member in 1948.Popescu Gogan Many times decorated, he was also elected to the Parliament of Romania (1946‚Äì1948), and to its successor, the Great National Assembly (a legislative body of little actual relevance; 1948‚Äì1952). =Final years= One of the last causes he was involved in was the peace movement (in the context of the Cold War), with the intention of helping in the creation of a \\"supreme areopagus of peace\\".Galaction, in Vianu, p.294 He was bedridden for the final years of his life, due to a stroke; this probably accounted for the scarcity in criticism aimed at him during the Zhdanovist campaign in Romania.FrunzƒÉ, p.374-375 His Diary was only published, selectively, two decades after his death, under the Nicolae Ceau»ôescu regime. The newer edition contains the censored discourse of an embittered Galaction, who had become heavily critical of Stalinism, while reviewing his own beliefs in an \\"Evangelical and cloud-like\\" socialism.Galaction, in MihƒÉilescu Galaction was also noted for the support he gave to Constantin Galeriu, who later became a celebrated priest and theologian. Galeriu, who had been one of Galaction's favourite students, was rescued by the latter in 1952, after he was arrested and imprisoned at the Danube-Black Sea Canal (Galaction successfully called on Prime Minister Petru Groza to intervene in his favor).\\"FƒÉcƒÉtorul de pace\\" Personal life Galaction had four daughters, one of whom, Maria or MƒÉrioara, was married to »òerban »öuculescu, the brother of painter Ion »öuculescu in 1936;Ivaniuc & Velescu; TƒÉnase one was the actress Elena Galaction StƒÉnciulescu and the other two, Magdalena and Lucre»õia, married Italian citizens -- the husband of Luki Galaction (Galaction Passarelli or Galaction Sciarra), who was a painter and a writer, was Domenico Sciarra, a prominent figure of the Fascist regime (whom Gala Galaction was visiting in Rome at the time of his denunciation). A friend of Communist politician Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Galaction helped his Jewish wife Herta Schwamen avoid anti-Semitic measures enforced in 1938 by the National Christian Party government, baptizing her Romanian Orthodox (she consequently took the Christian name Elena).Antoniu & T√¢rziu Galaction was a lifelong friend of the journalist Vasile Demetrius, whom he first collaborated with during the 1910s.Zalis, p.VI-VII He was also close to Vasile's daughter, the novelist and actress Lucia Demetrius, who expressed her gratitude for the moral support he gave her family after Vasile Demetrius died.Zalis, p.VII Relationship with the Jewish community  Galaction published articles in several Romanian-Jewish periodicals, such as M√¢ntuirea (1919‚Äì1922), Lumea Evree (1919‚Äì1920), »òtiri din Lumea EvreiascƒÉ (1924‚Äì1925) and Adam (1929‚Äì1939).CernƒÉtescu His contributions were later collected in the volume Sionismul la Prieteni (\\"Zionism among Friends\\"), published in 1919. Alongside his praise for Theodor Herzl, whom he considered \\"the greatest Israelite in the modern world\\",Galaction, in CernƒÉtescu he wrote: > \\"Whoever reads and loves the Bible cannot hate Israel.\\" In 1930, he was a pilgrim to Jerusalem, visiting the British Mandate of Palestine together with his lifelong friend and brother-in-law of his daughter, the painter Ion ≈¢uculescu,Ivaniuc & Velescu and both their families. Reviewing his travel memoir √én pƒÉm√¢ntul fƒÉgƒÉduin»õei (\\"In the Promised Land\\"), Alexandru A. Philippide, a fellow writer at Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, thought that Galaction's attitude was linked to both his own theological outlook on tolerance and the branch of Christianity he represented: > \\"[A] tolerant character is, after all, what sets Orthodoxy apart. Father > Galaction turns this into his point of honor. On the same ship as him there > were many Jewish immigrants, setting for Palestine. ¬´Brave soldiers of such > a passionate and sacrifice-eager ideal!¬ª exclaims Father Galaction.

Successive governments have increasingly provided formal legal and political opportunity for MƒÅori to seek redress for breaches by the Crown of the guarantees set out in the Treaty of Waitangi. While it has resulted in putting to rest a number of significant longstanding grievances, the process has been subject to criticisms from a number of angles, from those who believe that the redress is insufficient to compensate for MƒÅori losses, to those who see no value in revisiting painful and contentious historical issues. The settlements are typically seen as part of a broader MƒÅori Renaissance. Because the Treaty of Waitangi has limited legal standing in itself, the primary means of registering and researching Treaty claims is through the Waitangi Tribunal. The primary means of settling those claims is through negotiations with the government of the day.  History of the Treaty  The Treaty of Waitangi The Treaty of Waitangi is often considered to be the founding document for European (PƒÅkehƒÅ) settlement in New Zealand. It guaranteed to MƒÅori the right to keep their lands, forests, fisheries and all their treasures, but they would hand sovereignty in the English version, and governorship in the MƒÅori version, over to the Crown and would also be able to sell only to the Crown. Initially, there was little dispute, as the settlers were able to buy land from the MƒÅori through legal channels. However, after a while, MƒÅori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases. Agreements were negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from the wrong people altogether. Unrest and rebellion caused by these actions were met with further punitive land confiscations. Eventually this led to the New Zealand Wars, which culminated in the confiscation of a large part of the Waikato and Taranaki.  Early settlements  In the 1920s, land commissions investigated the grievances of hap≈´ whose land had been confiscated or otherwise fraudulently obtained in the previous century, and many were found to be valid. By the 1940s, settlements in the form of modest annual payments had been arranged with some hap≈´. However, hap≈´ came to consider the amounts to be inadequate, especially as inflation eroded their value, and the Crown has conceded that it did not sufficiently seek the agreement of hap≈´ to declare their claims settled.  The Waitangi Tribunal  During the late 1960s and 1970s the Treaty of Waitangi became the focus of a strong MƒÅori protest movement which rallied around calls for the government to 'honour the treaty' and to 'redress treaty grievances'. MƒÅori expressed their frustration about continuing violations of the treaty and subsequent legislation by government officials, as well as inequitable legislation and unsympathetic decisions by the MƒÅori Land Court alienating MƒÅori land from its MƒÅori owners. In 1975 the Treaty of Waitangi Act established the Waitangi Tribunal to hear claims of Crown violations of the Treaty of Waitangi, to address those concerns. It allowed any MƒÅori to lodge a claim against the Crown for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. Originally its mandate was limited to claims about contemporary issues, that is, those that occurred after the establishment of the Tribunal. Early claims included the \\"Te Reo MƒÅori\\" claim. As a result of the Tribunal's report into the claim, in 1987 the government made Te Reo MƒÅori an official language of New Zealand, and established the Maori Language Commission to foster it. The pivotal issue considered by the Tribunal was whether a language could be considered a \\"treasure\\" or \\"taonga\\", and thus protected by the Treaty. In 1985 the Fourth Labour Government extended the Tribunal's powers to allow it to consider Crown actions dating back to 1840, including the period covered by the New Zealand Wars. The number of claims quickly rose, and during the early 1990s, the government began to negotiate settlements of historical (pre-1992) claims. Settlements of the 1990s While early Tribunal recommendations mainly concerned a contemporary issue that could be revised or rectified by the government at the time, historical settlements raised more complex issues. The Office of Treaty Settlements was established in the Ministry of Justice to develop government policy on historical claims. In 1995, the government developed the \\"Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims\\" to attempt to address the issues. A key element of the proposals was the creation of a \\"fiscal envelope\\" of $1 billion for the settlement of all historical claims, an effective limit on what the Crown would pay out in settlements. The Crown held a series of consultation hui around the country, at which MƒÅori vehemently rejected such a limitation in advance of the extent of claims being fully known. The concept of the fiscal envelope was subsequently dropped after the 1996 general election. Despite the protest, three major settlements were reached during this time. The Minister of Justice and Treaty Negotiations at the time, Sir Douglas Graham, is credited with leading a largely conservative National government to make these breakthroughs. =Sealord= The Treaty guaranteed to MƒÅori their lands, forests and fisheries. Over time, however, New Zealand law began to regulate commercial fisheries, so that MƒÅori control was substantially eroded. To resolve this grievance, in 1989 an interim agreement was reached. The Crown transferred 10 percent of New Zealand's fishing quota (some 60,000 tonnes), together with shareholdings in fishing companies and $50 million in cash, to the Waitangi Fisheries Commission. This commission was responsible for holding the fisheries assets on behalf of MƒÅori until an agreement was reached as to how the assets were to be shared among tribes. In 1992, a second part of the deal, referred to as the Sealord deal, marked full and final settlement of MƒÅori commercial fishing claims under the Treaty of Waitangi. This included 50% of Sealord Fisheries and 20% of all new species brought under the quota system, more shares in fishing companies, and $18 million in cash. In total it was worth around $170 million. This settlement was undertaken under the leadership of the Hon. Matiu Rata and Dr. George Habib. =Waikato Tainui Raupatu= The first major settlement of historical confiscation, or raupatu, claims was agreed in 1995. Waikato-Tainui's confiscation claims were settled for a package worth $170 million, in a mixture of cash and Crown-owned land. The settlement was accompanied by a formal apology as part of the claims legislation, granted Royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II in person during her 1995 Royal tour of New Zealand. The Crown apologised for the Invasion of the Waikato and the subsequent indiscriminate confiscation of land. =NgƒÅi Tahu= NgƒÅi Tahu's claims covered a large proportion of the South Island of New Zealand, and related to the Crown's failure to meet its end of the bargain in land sales that took place from the 1840s. NgƒÅi Tahu sought recognition of their relationship with the land, as well as cash and property, and a number of novel arrangements were developed to address this. Among other things, NgƒÅi Tahu and the Crown agreed that Mt Cook would be formally renamed Aoraki / Mount Cook, and returned to NgƒÅi Tahu to be gifted back to the people of New Zealand. Settlements of the 2000s The process of negotiating historical claims continued after the 1999 election and the subsequent change in government without radical change to government policy. The models developed for the early settlements remain a strong influence. The first Labour Minister of Treaty Negotiations was Margaret Wilson. On her appointment as Speaker of the House in early 2005, she was followed in the role by Mark Burton. He was replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen in November 2007. In June 2008, the Crown and representatives from seven Maori tribes signed an agreement relating to Crown forest land that was dubbed \\"Treelords\\" by the media, because of perceived similarities to the Sealord deal of the 1990s. Like Sealord, it relates to a single issue, but covers multiple tribes. The agreement contains only financial redress, on account against comprehensive settlements to be negotiated with each tribe within the Collective. The agreement is the largest to date, by financial value, at NZ$196 million worth of forest land in total (including the value of the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapu share). In addition, but not counted by the government as part of the redress package, the tribes will receive rentals that have accumulated on the land since 1989, valued at NZ$223 million. As at July 2008, there have been 23 settlements (counting the above) of various sizes. Except as noted above, settlements generally include financial redress, a formal Crown apology for breaches of the Treaty, and recognition of the group's cultural associations with various sites. In November 2008, Chris Finlayson, a Wellington-based lawyer with experience in Treaty claims, was appointed Minister for Treaty Negotiations following the National Party victory in the 2008 election. As well as the much publicised land and financial compensation, many of these later settlements included changing the official placenames. This has introduced significant numbers of macrons into official New Zealand placenames for the first time.

This aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the MƒÅori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty.Paul Moon (2002) Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi The first stage of the report was released in November 2014, and found that MƒÅori chiefs in Northland never agreed to give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Although the Crown intended to negotiate the transfer of sovereignty through the Treaty, the chiefs' understanding of the agreement was they were only ceding the power for the Crown to control PƒÅkehƒÅ and protect MƒÅori. Tribunal manager Julie Tangaere said at the report's release to the Ngapuhi claimants: In terms of mana motuhake He Whakaputanga, creating a MƒÅori state and government in 1835 and/or Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and those who did not sign anything, thus maintaining mana motuhake. In relation to the former, a summary report (entitled ‚ÄòNgƒÅpuhi Speaks‚Äô) of evidence presented to the Waitangi Tribunal conclusively demonstrates that: # NgƒÅpuhi did not cede their sovereignty. # The Crown had recognised He Whakaputanga as a proclamation by the rangatira of their sovereignty over this country. # The treaty entered into by the rangatira and the Crown ‚Äî Te Tiriti o Waitangi ‚Äî followed on from He Whakaputanga, establishing the role of the British Crown with respect to PƒÅkehƒÅ. # The treaty delegated to Queen Victoria‚Äôs governor the authority to exercise control over hitherto lawless PƒÅkehƒÅ people in areas of hap≈´ land allocated to the Queen. # The Crown‚Äôs English language document, referred to as the Treaty of Waitangi, was neither seen nor agreed to by NgƒÅpuhi and instead reflects the hidden wishes of British imperial power. Non-Signatory Iwi and Hapu Ngati Tuwharetoa academic Hemopereki Simon outlined a case in 2017, using Ngati Tuwharetoa as a case study, for how hapu and iwi that did not sign the Treaty still maintain mana motuhake and how the sovereignty of the Crown could be considered questionable. This work was builds on the Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry(Wai 1040) decision by the Waitangi Tribunal.  Criticisms  The Treaty settlement process has attracted criticisms from across the political spectrum since it began. As noted above, MƒÅori were concerned that the level of redress provided was too low, and that the settlement process was subject to too much Crown control. Conservationists were concerned about the impact of claims to conservation land, and many PƒÅkehƒÅ were concerned that settlements would directly affect them. Public Access New Zealand and the One New Zealand Foundation respectively were lobby groups formed to represent these views. In general, those who feel that the Treaty claims process has gone too far are PƒÅkehƒÅ, while those who believe it does not go far enough are MƒÅori. However, there are some exceptions on both sides: the politician who has perhaps been most prominent in arguing against the Treaty is Winston Peters, who is MƒÅori, while there have been a number of PƒÅkehƒÅ pro-Treaty groups. However, during the 1990s there was broad agreement between major political parties that the settlement of historical claims was appropriate, within the confines of the government's policy to limit impact on private landowners and access to conservation land. Legislation enacting Treaty settlements was passed by Parliament with an overwhelming majority. On the claimants' side, support for a settlement was expressed through ratification among adult members of a tribe, in contrast with the early settlement attempts of the 1940s. Over time, the consensus on the part of politicians has frayed. Winston Peters has critiqued the increasing number of claims registered at the Waitangi Tribunal, a result of the law which allows any MƒÅori to lodge a claim, and suggested that a \\"Treaty of Waitangi Gravy Train\\" has formed around the claims process. The ACT party has echoed that criticism ‚Äì despite stating that \\"claims should be promptly settled where land was unlawfully taken or improperly compensated, if we can identify the descendants of those who were wronged\\", they have never voted in support of Treaty settlement legislation, and coined the phrase \\"Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry\\", to describe the participants in the settlement process. The Orewa Speech in 2004 saw the National Party for the first time take up the term \\"Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry\\". National's MƒÅori Affairs spokeswoman Georgina te Heuheu, who was Associate Minister to Sir Douglas Graham, was replaced in the role by Gerry Brownlee. Specific criticism that members of the National Party have made against settlements is that they are not being negotiated quickly enough, that insufficient attention is being given to ensure that claimant negotiators have the support of their people, and that settlement legislation is giving inappropriate weight to the spiritual beliefs of MƒÅori. The MƒÅori Party and Green Party both criticise Treaty settlements on the grounds that the Crown has too much power in negotiations, that settlements negotiated at an iwi level ignore the rights of hapu (clans or subtribes), and that settlement redress is too parsimonious. While some disagreement remains, parties unanimously supported the legislation to implement the Te Roroa, Affiliate Te Arawa and Central North Island settlements, which were passed in September 2008.  Academic critique  Maori academics Evan Poata-Smith, Carwyn Jones, Margaret Mutu, Linda Te Aho, Hemopereki Simon and Robert Joseph are critical of the processes of Treaty settlement.

He was a \\"central figure in the Nazi program of the extermination of Galician Jews\\".Bruno Schulz (everything2.com) He is known for his daily diary and for temporarily sparing the life of the Jewish/Polish artist Bruno Schulz in 1942. Landau liked Schulz's art and supplied him with protection and extra food. In return, he ordered the artist to paint a set of murals for his young son's bedroom, depicting scenes from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Landau also was the SS officer assigned to watch over Maria Altmann, the subject of the film Woman in Gold (2015).L.A. Magazine (October 2006)  Early career  In 1925, Landau joined National Socialist Youth and was expelled from apprentice boarding school (run by a Catholic lay order) for active recruitment activities. In 1930 he joined Austrian Bundesheer (2nd Dragoner Squadron). In March 1931 he joined NSDAP and in May became a political leader of a local Nazi army district. In June 1933 was expelled from Bundesheer for Nazi activities. From June 1933 to April 1934 Felix Landau was a member of Sturmabteilung (SA), after that in SS. For participation in the assassination of Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss (1934) he was imprisoned. Upon his release in 1937, he renewed Nazi activities and had to flee to avoid another arrest. Landau became a naturalized German citizen, got married and worked as a police assistant in the Gestapo.  World War II and service in Einsatzkommando  In 1940, Landau transferred to KdS/SD in Radom governed by the General Government where he met typist Gertrude, to whom he later addressed his letters. In June 1941, Felix Landau volunteered for Einsatzkommando service. He began his diary in July 1941, interspersing sentimental letters to his fianc√©e with detailed records of his participation in atrocities of what later came to be known as the Holocaust. He describes \\"shooting exercises\\" and \\"wild actions\\", shooting sprees wherein he and his men would pick off random Jews who worked nearby or passed by on the street. In one such event in November 1942, Landau killed the personal dentist of a fellow officer, Karl G√ºnther. In revenge, G√ºnther caught up with Bruno Schulz, then under the protection of Landau, and shot him twice in the head. According to Schulz's friend Izydor Friedman, who witnessed the death, this happened at the corner of Czacki and Mickiewicz Streets. Later, G√ºnther told Landau: \\"You killed my Jew - I killed yours.\\" At the end of 1941, he lived with Gertrude in an aristocratic villa. He divorced his first wife in 1942 and married Gertrude in 1943 (divorced in 1946). Until May 1943, Landau was in charge of organizing Jewish labor.  After World War II  In 1946, a former worker recognized him in Linz. Landau was arrested by the Americans but escaped from Glasenbach prison camp in August 1947. Under the name of Rudolf Jaschke he started an interior decorating company in Bavaria.The Lost. Searching for Bruno Schulz by Ruth Franklin (The New Yorker, December 16, 2002) In 1959, Landau was arrested and accused of the massacres. He was condemned to life imprisonment in 1962 at the Stuttgart Assize Court. In 1973 he was pardoned.Bert Hoppe, Hildrun Glass (Bearbeiter): Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europ√§ischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933 - 1945.

Quotes from the diary  * Lwow - 5 July 1941... There were hundreds of Jews walking along the street with blood pouring down their faces, holes in their heads, their hands broken and their eyes hanging out of their sockets. They were covered in blood. Some were carrying others who had collapsed. We went to the citadel; there we saw things that few people have ever seen. At the entrance to the citadel there were soldiers standing guard. They were holding clubs as thick as a man's wrist and were lashing out and hitting anyone who crossed their path. The Jews were pouring out of the entrance. There were rows of Jews lying one on top of the other like pigs, whimpering horribly. The Jews kept streaming out of the citadel completely covered in blood. We stopped and tried to see who was in charge of the Kommando. Nobody. Someone had let the Jews go. They were just being hit out of rage and hatred... * Drohobycz - 12 July 1941... At 6:00 in the morning I was suddenly awoken from a deep sleep. Report for an execution. Fine, so I'll just play executioner and then gravedigger, why not?... Twenty-three had to be shot, amongst them ... two women ... We had to find a suitable spot to shoot and bury them. After a few minutes we found a place. The death candidates assembled with shovels to dig their own graves. Two of them were weeping. The others certainly have incredible courage... Strange, I am completely unmoved. No pity, nothing. That's the way it is and then it's all over... Valuables, watches and money are put into a pile... The two women are lined up at one end of the grave ready to be shot first... As the women walked to the grave they were completely composed. They turned around. Six of us had to shoot them. The job was assigned thus: three at the heart, three at the head. I took the heart. The shots were fired and the brains whizzed through the air. Two in the head is too much. They almost tear it off...

It was controversial abroad at the time of its first release for its frank depiction of nudity and, along with the film One Summer of Happiness from the year before, directed by Arne Mattsson, it helped to create the reputation of Sweden as a sexually liberated country. The film made a star of its lead actress, Harriet Andersson. Bergman had been intimately involved with Andersson at the time and conceived the film as a vehicle for her. The two of them would continue to work together, even after their romantic relationship had ended, in films like Sawdust and Tinsel, Smiles of a Summer Night, Through a Glass Darkly, and Cries and Whispers. Synopsis The film's story begins in the bleak working- class milieu of Stockholm. Harry (Lars Ekborg) and Monika (Harriet Andersson) are both in dead end jobs when they meet. Harry is easygoing, while Monika is adventurous, but they fall in love. When Monika gets in trouble at home, Harry steals his father's boat, and he and Monika spend an idyllic summer in the Stockholm archipelago. When the end of the summer forces them to return home, it is clear that Monika is pregnant. Harry happily accepts responsibility and settles down with Monika and their child; he gets a real job and goes to night school to provide for his family. Monika, however, is unsatisfied with her role as homemaker. She yearns for excitement and adventure, a desire which finally leads her astray. Harry leaves town for work and comes home a day early to find his wife with another man. They get a divorce and Harry is left behind with custody of their daughter, June, to raise alone.

It combined vehicular combat with role- playing elements, allowing the player to explore a post-apocalyptic future in customizable cars, motorcycles, semis, and tanks. It took inspiration, in part, from the Mad Max series of films. Players could choose to play as one of three fictional factions‚ÄîHumans, Mutants, and Biomeks‚Äîas well as a class to determine the type of character they would play. The majority of the gameplay took place in a vehicle, but the player could leave the vehicle when entering towns in order to purchase items, talk to contacts, etc. The game servers were shut down on August 31, 2007, and players were no longer billed. NetDevil issued a statement shortly after the shutdown news, citing an agreement with NCsoft to buy out the IP rights was not reached. Synopsis After years of widescale open war between three factions‚ÄîHumans, mutants, and the human- created Biomeks‚Äîthe issues between the groups are largely pacified on the worldwide scale, but conflict between the three remain with small scale battles involving armored cars, trucks, motorcycles, semis and tanks armed with advanced weaponry. This is the fictional, futuristic world the player starts and plays the game in. Gameplay The game takes place in the 23rd century, after the sterilization attempt that left the Earth in ruins. Players play as either one of a new generation of Mutants, a BioMek or one of the newly emerging Humans. Players fight in their race's area of control against Non-playable characters (or NPCs) and eventually reach Ground Zero, or GZ. There, they can either fight against NPCs or Players in two different \\"layers\\" known as instances. One \\"layer\\" is the PvP layer, in which the player can go and fight against players of opposing races. The other \\"layer\\" is controlled by the faction you belong to. It is the non-PvP layer in which usually players complete their quests from GZ in. The PvP elements of the game are not available in this layer, since only other members of your faction are there. All NPC enemies are in both layers. The game centers on 3rd person vehicular combat using state of the art weapons to combat foes. Auto Assault takes place in two settings; towns and the outside world. The town is experienced by moving the player's customized character around, interacting with NPCs, other players, and environmental objects. Upgrades and vehicles can be bought here. When the player chooses to exit the city he/she is in, they are taken to the outside world, where they traverse the terrain in heavily armed vehicles. Combat is reminiscent of a third person shooter game, with movement, aiming and firing being done in real time with the keyboard and mouse. There are also character skills, which activate special abilities. Auto Assault differs from other MMORPGs as it doesn't have a Death Penalty and the player can die without consequence. Shutdown Due to lack of subscribers, a decision was made to terminate support for the product. This was communicated by the company on the Public Forums one month prior to shutting down. On July 2, 2007, it was officially announced that Auto Assault's servers would be shut down August 31 and that the subscribers' accounts would be 'reconciled'. Offers to continue to run servers by various parties were denied, but additional ‚ÄúParting Gifts‚Äù were sent via e-mail with, \\"...opportunities to take a part in some of our other products, including Richard Garriott‚Äôs Tabula Rasa and City of Heroes...\\" Reception At the time of release, the game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

When the position operator is considered with a wide enough domain (e.g. the space of tempered distributions), its eigenvalues are the possible position vectors of the particle. In one dimension, if by the symbol : x \\\\rangle we denote the unitary eigenvector of the position operator corresponding to the eigenvalue x, then, x \\\\rangle represents the state of the particle in which we know with certainty to find the particle itself at position x. Therefore, denoted the position operator by the symbol X in literature we find also other meaningful symbols for the position operator, for instance Q (from Lagrangian mechanics), \\\\hat \\\\mathrm x and so on we can write : Xx\\\\rangle = xx\\\\rangle , for every real position x. One possible realization of the unitary state with position x is the Dirac delta (function) distribution centered at the position x, often denoted by \\\\delta_x. In quantum mechanics, the ordered (continuous) family of all Dirac distributions, i.e. the family : \\\\delta=(\\\\delta_x)_ {x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R} , is called the (unitary) position basis (in one dimension), just because it is a (unitary) eigenbasis of the position operator X. It is fundamental to observe that there exists only one linear continuous endomorphism X on the space of tempered distributions such that : X(\\\\delta_x) = x \\\\delta_x , for every real point x. It's possible to prove that the unique above endomorphism is necessarily defined by : X(\\\\psi) = \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi , for every tempered distribution \\\\psi, where \\\\mathrm x denotes the coordinate function of the position line defined from the real line into the complex plane by : \\\\mathrm x : \\\\mathbb R \\\\to \\\\mathbb C : x \\\\mapsto x . Introduction In one dimension for a particle confined into a straight line the square modulus : \\\\psi^2 = \\\\psi^* \\\\psi , of a normalized square integrable wave-function : \\\\psi : \\\\mathbb R \\\\to \\\\mathbb C , represents the probability density of finding the particle at some position x of the real- line, at a certain time. In other terms, if at a certain instant of time the particle is in the state represented by a square integrable wave function \\\\psi and assuming the wave function \\\\psi be of L^2-norm equal 1, : \\\\\\\\psi\\\\^2 = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} \\\\psi^2 d \\\\mathrm x = 1, then the probability to find the particle in the position range [a,b] is : \\\\pi_X (\\\\psi)([a,b]) = \\\\int_a^b \\\\psi^2 d \\\\mathrm x . Hence the expected value of a measurement of the position X for the particle is the value : \\\\langle X \\\\rangle_{\\\\psi} = \\\\int_\\\\mathbb R \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi^2 d \\\\mathrm x = \\\\int_\\\\mathbb R \\\\psi^* \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi d \\\\mathrm x, where: # the particle is assumed to be in the state \\\\psi ; # the function \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi^2 is supposed integrable, i.e. of class L^1; # we indicate by \\\\mathrm x the coordinate function of the position axis. Accordingly, the quantum mechanical operator corresponding to the observable position X is denoted also by : X = \\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x} , and defined : \\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x} \\\\psi\\\\right) (x) = x\\\\psi(x) , for every wave function \\\\psi and for every point x of the real line. The circumflex over the function \\\\mathrm x on the left side indicates the presence of an operator, so that this equation may be read: the result of the position operator X acting on any wave function \\\\psi equals the coordinate function \\\\mathrm x multiplied by the wave-function \\\\psi . Or more simply, the operator X multiplies any wave-function \\\\psi by the coordinate function \\\\mathrm x . Note 1. To be more explicit, we have introduced the coordinate function : \\\\mathrm x : \\\\mathbb R \\\\to \\\\mathbb C : x \\\\mapsto x , which simply imbeds the position-line into the complex plane, it is nothing more than the canonical embedding of the real line into the complex plane. Note 2. The expected value of the position operator, upon a wave function (state) \\\\psi can be reinterpreted as a scalar product: : \\\\langle X \\\\rangle_{\\\\psi} = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi^2 = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\psi^* (\\\\mathrm x \\\\psi) = \\\\langle \\\\psi  X(\\\\psi) \\\\rangle , assuming the particle in the state \\\\psi \\\\in L^2 and assuming the function \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi be of class L^2 which immediately implies that the function \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi^2 Is integrable, i.e. of class L^1. Note 3. Strictly speaking, the observable position X can be point-wisely defined as : \\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x} \\\\psi\\\\right) (x) = x\\\\psi(x) , for every wave function \\\\psi and for every point x of the real line, upon the wave-functions which are precisely point-wise defined functions. In the case of equivalence classes \\\\psi \\\\in L^2 the definition reads directly as follows : \\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x} \\\\psi = \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi , for every wave-function \\\\psi \\\\in L^2. Basic properties  In the above definition, as the careful reader can immediately remark, does not exist any clear specification of domain and co-domain for the position operator (in the case of a particle confined upon a line). In literature, more or less explicitly, we find essentially three main directions for this fundamental issue. Eigenstates The eigenfunctions of the position operator (on the space of tempered distributions), represented in position space, are Dirac delta functions. Informal proof. To show that possible eigenvectors of the position operator should necessarily be Dirac delta distributions, suppose that \\\\psi is an eigenstate of the position operator with eigenvalue x_0 . We write the eigenvalue equation in position coordinates, : \\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x}\\\\psi(x) = \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi(x) = x_0 \\\\psi(x) recalling that \\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x} simply multiplies the wave-functions by the function x , in the position representation. Since the function x is variable while x_0 is a constant, \\\\psi must be zero everywhere except at the point x_0 . Clearly, no continuous function satisfies such properties, moreover we cannot simply define the wave-function to be a complex number at that point because its L^2-norm would be 0 and not 1. This suggest the need of a \\"functional object\\" concentrated at the point x_0 and with integral different from 0: any multiple of the Dirac delta centered at x_0. \\\\blacksquare The normalized solution to the equation : \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi = x_0 \\\\psi is : \\\\psi(x) = \\\\delta(x - x_0) , or better : \\\\psi = \\\\delta _{x_0} . Proof. Here we prove rigorously that : \\\\mathrm x \\\\delta_{x_0} = x_0 \\\\delta_{x_0} . Indeed, recalling that the product of any function by the Dirac distribution centered at a point is the value of the function at that point times the Dirac distribution itself, we obtain immediately : \\\\mathrm x \\\\delta_{x_0} = \\\\mathrm x (x_0) \\\\delta_{x_0} = x_0 \\\\delta_{x_0} . \\\\blacksquare Meaning of the Dirac delta wave. Although such Dirac states are physically unrealizable and, strictly speaking, they are not functions, Dirac distribution centered at x_0 can be thought of as an \\"ideal state\\" whose position is known exactly (any measurement of the position always returns the eigenvalue x_0 ). Hence, by the uncertainty principle, nothing is known about the momentum of such a state. Three dimensions The generalisation to three dimensions is straightforward. The space-time wavefunction is now \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) and the expectation value of the position operator \\\\hat \\\\mathbf{r} at the state \\\\psi is : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\hat \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\right\\\\rangle _\\\\psi = \\\\int \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\psi^2 d^3 \\\\mathbf{r} where the integral is taken over all space. The position operator is :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}}\\\\psi = \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\psi Momentum space Usually, in Quantum Mechanics, by representation in the momentum space we intend the representation of states and observables with respect to the canonical unitary momentum basis : \\\\eta = \\\\left(\\\\left[ (2\\\\pi\\\\hbar)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} e^{(\\\\iota/\\\\hbar) (\\\\mathrm xp)}\\\\right]\\\\right) _{p \\\\in \\\\mathbb R} . In momentum space, the position operator in one dimension is represented by the following differential operator : \\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x}\\\\right)_P = i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{d}{d \\\\mathrm p} = i\\\\frac{d}{d \\\\mathrm k} , where: * the representation of the position operator in the momentum basis is naturally defined by \\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x}\\\\right)_P (\\\\psi)_P = \\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathrm x}\\\\psi\\\\right)_P , for every wave function (tempered distribution) \\\\psi; * \\\\mathrm p represents the coordinate function on the momentum line and the wave-vector function \\\\mathrm k is defined by \\\\mathrm k = \\\\mathrm p/\\\\hbar . Formalism in L^2(\\\\mathbb R,\\\\mathbb C)  Consider, for example, the case of a spinless particle moving in one spatial dimension (i.e. in a line). The state space for such a particle contains the L2-space (Hilbert space) L^2(\\\\mathbb R,\\\\mathbb C) of complex-valued and square-integrable (with respect to the Lebesgue measure) functions on the real line. The position operator in L^2(\\\\mathbb R, \\\\mathbb C) , : Q : D_Q \\\\to L^2(\\\\mathbb R, \\\\mathbb C) : \\\\psi \\\\mapsto \\\\mathrm q \\\\psi, is pointwise defined by: : Q (\\\\psi)(x) = x \\\\psi (x) = \\\\mathrm q(x) \\\\psi (x), for each pointwisely defined square integrable class \\\\psi \\\\in D_Q and for each real number x, with domain : D_Q = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi \\\\in L^2({\\\\mathbb R}) \\\\mid \\\\mathrm q \\\\psi \\\\in L^2({\\\\mathbb R}) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\mathrm q : \\\\mathbb R \\\\to \\\\mathbb C is the coordinate function sending each point x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R to itself. Since all continuous functions with compact support lie in D(Q), Q is densely defined. Q, being simply multiplication by x, is a self adjoint operator, thus satisfying the requirement of a quantum mechanical observable. Immediately from the definition we can deduce that the spectrum consists of the entire real line and that Q has purely continuous spectrum, therefore no discrete eigenvalues. The three-dimensional case is defined analogously. We shall keep the one-dimensional assumption in the following discussion. Measurement theory in L^2(\\\\mathbb R, \\\\mathbb C) As with any quantum mechanical observable, in order to discuss position measurement, we need to calculate the spectral resolution of the position operator : X : D_X \\\\to L^2(\\\\mathbb R, \\\\mathbb C) : \\\\psi \\\\mapsto \\\\mathrm x \\\\psi which is : X = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\ \\\\lambda \\\\ d \\\\mu_X(\\\\lambda) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\ \\\\mathrm x \\\\ \\\\mu_X = \\\\mu_X (\\\\mathrm x) , where \\\\mu_X is the so-called spectral measure of the position operator. Since the operator of X is just the multiplication operator by the embedding function \\\\mathrm x, its spectral resolution is simple. For a Borel subset B of the real line, let \\\\chi _B denote the indicator function of B. We see that the projection-valued measure : \\\\mu_X : \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Pr}^\\\\perp \\\\left(L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\mathbb{C})\\\\right) is given by : \\\\mu_X(B)(\\\\psi) = \\\\chi_B \\\\psi , i.e., the orthogonal projection \\\\mu_X(B) is the multiplication operator by the indicator function of B. Therefore, if the system is prepared in a state \\\\psi, then the probability of the measured position of the particle belonging to a Borel set B is : \\\\\\\\mu_X(B)(\\\\psi)\\\\^2 = \\\\\\\\chi_B \\\\psi\\\\^2 = \\\\int_B \\\\psi^2\\\\ \\\\mu = \\\\pi_X(\\\\psi)(B), where \\\\mu is the Lebesgue measure on the real line. After any measurement aiming to detect the particle within the subset B, the wave function collapses to either : \\\\frac{\\\\mu_X(B) \\\\psi}{\\\\\\\\mu_X(B) \\\\psi \\\\} = \\\\frac{\\\\chi_B \\\\psi}{\\\\ \\\\chi_B \\\\psi \\\\} or : \\\\frac{(1 - \\\\chi_B)\\\\psi}{\\\\(1 - \\\\chi_B)\\\\psi\\\\} , where \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\ is the Hilbert space norm on L^2(\\\\mathbb R, \\\\mathbb C).

It is named after the writer, Jan Neruda. The school ranks as the second best secondary (high) school, and the best public secondary school in the Czech Republic according to the Czech Ministry of Education, based on the performance of students/graduates at the Maturita (A-level equivalent).http://www.msmt.cz/file/16368_1_1/  Description  The grammar school is located on Hellichova Street in Prague. Jan Neruda Grammar School offers two courses of study: bilingual (French-Czech) and general (there used to be two general courses, science and humanities, although the difference between the two courses was marginal compared to the Anglo-Saxon education system; recently, these two courses have been merged). In the first and second years bilingual-course students are taught in Czech, but from the third year most subjects (apart from languages, fine arts and sports) are taught in French. It takes 6 years to complete the Grammar school. The staff of the Grammar school consists of about 65 teachers. Between 1996 and 2012 the school offered also a separate course consisting of general subjects and extensive music lessons for musically talented students in a different building located on Komensk√©ho Square (nowadays an unrelated institution with its own headmaster). The Grammar school is a member of the ASPnet UNESCO network. The school building is barrier-free.  Subjects and activities  The structure of the course reflects the Czech national curriculum and consists of following subjects: Compulsory subjects: * Czech ‚Äì Czech and world literature, Czech writing, Czech grammar * English * German * French * Mathematics * Physics * Chemistry * Biology/Geology * History ‚Äì Czech and world history, including modern history * Social sciences ‚Äì psychology, philosophy, sociology, political science, law, economics * Geography * IT * Latin/Descriptive geometry * Music ‚Äì singing, playing instruments, history of music, theory * Arts ‚Äì creative lessons * Physical education * Media education ‚Äì an integrated subject, no separate lessons Various elective and optional subjects, e.g.: * Literature seminar * Humanities * Biology seminar * History seminar * Chemistry seminar * History of arts The school offeres many activities for students: sports (weekly training sessions of various sports, regular weekend or week-long courses ‚Äì skiing, canoeing, cycling, climbing, ski mountaineering, windsurfing, cross-country skiing etc.), languages (Spanish, Russian, Japanese), photography course, drama course, choir, discussion club, EYP and UN delegations, excursions (history, arts, technical, biology, psychology/psychiatry, law, charities), group psychology sessions, competitions (mathematics, cipher challenge, physics, astronomy, music, discussion, poetry reciting, presenting, chess, Latin, French conversation), lectures, cultural events (theatre, cinema, classical music concerts), virtual company trade fair (business-presenatation skills, second year students), reduced-price theatre tickets, student-run festivals and events, and many other projects, pop-up events and activities. The school has an extended network of foreign schools (France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Britain) and students are expected to participate in student exchanges that are provided every year. The school organises a skiing course for students in their second year (Czech national curriculum), a teambuilding course for the first-year students, a skiing-language course in the third year, and a canoeing or cycling/climbing course in the fourth year. These courses are a fixed part of the school year. The school and its students contribute to several charity organisations.http://kabcizj.gjn.cz/charita_main.html  Administration  The current headmaster is PhDr. Zuzana Wienerov√° , she has an assistant headmaster, RNDr. Jarom√≠r Kekule, Ph.D and Mgr. ≈†tƒõp√°n Miƒçka.

Its first English translation was published in the same year as the original. The book was serialized by the magazine Tygodnik Illustrowany between 1897‚Äì1899 before its first complete printed edition appeared in 1900. The book was first translated into English by Jeremiah Curtin, a contemporary of Henryk Sienkiewicz.Polish official site about translators of H. Sienkiewicz novels and short stories. Poland.gov.pl. Retrieved October 8, 2011. The Teutonic Knights had since been translated into 25 languages. It was the first book to be printed in Poland at the end of World War II in 1945, due to its relevance in the context of Nazi German destruction of Poland followed by mass population transfers. The book was made into a movie in 1960 by Aleksander Ford. Historical background The novel was written by Sienkiewicz in 1900, when the Polish state, after being partitioned among Russian, Austrian and German empires in the late 18th century, did not exist, and most Poles were living in the Russian occupation zone named Vistula Land, formerly Congress Poland. One of Sienkiewicz's goals in writing The Knights of the Cross was to encourage and strengthen Polish national confidence against the occupying powers. To circumvent Russian censorship, he placed the plot in the Middle Ages, around Prussia and the State of the Teutonic Order. The history of the German Order of the Teutonic Knights is the backdrop for the story. From the , the Order controlled large parts of the Baltic Sea coast until its defeat at the 1410 Battle of Grunwald by the United Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania. The novel focuses extensively on the medieval life and customs of both, the cities and the countryside of Medieval Poland. In 1960, the novel was made into a Polish film of the same name by director Aleksander Ford, with Emil Karewicz as King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. Plot summary Copy of the manuscript of the first page by Henryk Sienkiewicz Krzy≈ºacy tells the story of a young nobleman, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec, who together with his uncle Maƒáko of Bogdaniec returns from the war against the Order (Knights of the Cross) in nearby Lithuania. In a tavern inn Zbyszko falls in love with the lovely Danusia, who is traveling with the court of the Duchess Anna. He swears to her his knight's oath and promises to bring her \\"three trophies\\" from the Teutonic Knights. On his way to the royal city of Krak√≥w (Cracow), Zbyszko attacks Kuno von Liechtenstein, who is an official diplomatic delegate of the Teutonic Knights. The penalty is death. Yet, on the scaffold, Danusia saves him from execution when she jumps onto the platform in full view of the crowd, and promises to marry him, covering his head with her handkerchief (an old Polish tradition that carries with it a stay of execution if the couple wed). Zbyszko and Maƒáko return home to their estate, where they rebuild their mansion. After some time Zbyszko returns to Danu≈õka and marries her. However, she is soon treacherously kidnapped by four Teutonic Knights who want revenge ‚Äì her father Jurand fought against the Germans. Jurand himself is soon captured by them, imprisoned and cruelly tortured and maimed. Zbyszko's quest to find and save his kidnapped Danusia continues until, at long last, he rescues her. However, it is too late already. Danuta has been driven insane because of her treatment at the hands of her captors, and eventually dies. The long-awaited war begins. The combined forces of Poland and Lithuania under the command of Polish King Ladislaus Jagiello destroy the Teutonic Order in the monumental 1410 Battle of Grunwald. This battle signals the true terminal decline of the Teutonic Order. Plot description =Chapters 1 ‚Äì 6= The novel opens with some wealthy Poles conversing with a knight, Maƒáko of Bogdaniec, in the Savage Bull inn at Tyniec. The old knight and his young nephew, Zbyszko, are returning to their birthplace after fighting for King Vitold of Lithuania against the Knights of the Cross under the command of Konrad, the Grand Master and his brother, Ulrich of Jungingen, burgomaster of Sambia. Princess Anna Danuta of Mazovia's entourage arrives at the inn on their way to Cracow and it is here that Zbyszko falls under the spell of her ward, Danusia, and makes a vow to her to lay some German peacock plumes before her. Maƒáko and Zbyszko, after a quarrel, decide to apply to Prince Jurand of Spych√≥w for service against the Germans as a great war is coming and accompany Princess Anna. On the road they encounter a splendidly armed knight, who is praying. Behind him is a retinue and Zbyszko spots a German knight and attacks him with his lance but the first knight, Povala of Tachev, stops him and reveals that he is in the King's service escorting the German envoy and states that Zbyszko has committed a criminal offence and makes him swear to appear before a Cracow court. Matsko tries to beg forgiveness from the German, Kuno von Lichtenstein, but he insists they bow down before him which the Polish knights refuse to do as it goes against their honour. Matsko and Zbyshko lodge with Povala at his house on Saint Anne Street. They discuss their recent campaigns with other Polish knights and attend the royal court of Yagello and Yadviga, who is pregnant. At dinner Lichtenstein reveals that he was attacked on the road to Tynets by a knight and Povala confirms it. The king is furious; he had accepted the Polish proposal to convert to Catholicism and marry the young Queen Yadviga to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights. In a fit of fury Yagello commands to have Zbyshko's head cut off for disgracing him and he is led off to prison. At a court the death sentence is passed down by the Castellan of Cracow but execution delayed until Yadviga gives birth. The baby dies and Yagello, who has left Cracow, returns distraught and Matsko also returns from his journey to the Grand Master to beg forgiveness for Zbyshko's life. On the way, he is wounded by a German arrow from an ambush in the forest. A scaffold is erected and Princess Anna takes counsel with Yastrembets, Father Stanislav of Skarbimir and other learned men to seek a legal way out. On the day of the execution and, as Zbyshko is led out, Povala gives him Danusia who throws her veil over his head saying, ‚ÄòHe is mine! He is mine!‚Äô. According to Slav custom, when an innocent maiden does this, it is a sign that she wants to marry him and he is saved from death. The nephew and uncle decide to return to Bogdanets where old Matsko needs to drink bears fat to remove the arrow-head. Yurand of Spyhov, Danusia's father, comes to the court and Zbyshko meets him but is told he cannot marry his daughter and the father and daughter return to Tsehanov. =Chapters 7 ‚Äì 14= The two men meet their neighbour Zyh of Zgorzelitse near Bogdanets who is hunting with his daughter, Yagenka, who admire Zbyshko for killing a huge bull bison with his crossbow. They settle into the old house and Yagenka comes to help them with furniture and food from her generous father. They also learn from her father that two young men are seeking her love, Vilk of Brozova and Stan of Rogov. Zbyshko goes to the forest to kill a bear in a nearby swamp and is nearly overcome by it but Yagenka assists in putting the fork into the ground so he can then kill it with his axe. Matko drinks the fresh fat and immediately starts to recover and finally the arrowhead is pulled out. ON a hunting expedition to kill beaver, Yagenka asks Zbyskho about Danusia (after being told by her father about the veil incident). Later, the two men meet their distant relative, the abbot to whom their land is mortgaged, and all attend a church service with the nobility at Kresnia and Zybshko fights with Vilk and Stan for which, as enemies of the abbot, Matko receives a bag of coin from him. However, Zbyshko's vow to Danusia angers the abbot who wishes him for Yagenka of whom he is very fond and the cleric leaves in a fit of anger. =Chapters 15 ‚Äì 20= Zbyshko and Matsko sets of for Mazovia with their captured Turks as an escort ‚Äì Zbyshko to claim Danusia as his wife from her father. He is followed by the Cheh, named Hlava, of Yagenka's. They come across a man in the forest ‚Äì a German fake relic seller called Sanderus who joins the retinue and tells Zbyshko that he has seen Danusia. On the road he encounters some knights of the cross, and meets De Lorche, a knight of Lorraine, who he challenges but Yendrek, the Polish escort, forbids the fight. They finally reach the Mazovian royal court of Prince Yanush which is on a hunting expedition at Kurpie where they find Danusia with Princess Anne. On the hunt a wild bull attacks the Princess's retinue and De Lorche and Zybshko defend it but both are injured and it is Hlava who kills it with his axe. Danveld and Siegfried von Lowe, Brother Rotgier and Brother Gottfried are German envoys seeking Prince Yanush's punishment of Yurand for his deadly acts against their Order but he refuses. As a result, they hatch a plot to kidnap Danusia and use her as a ransom to capture her father. On their return to the border they are accompanied by De Fourcy who dislikes the conspiracy and the four men murder him and claim it was done by Hlava who rides up with Zbyshko's challenge; avoiding Danveld's knife, the Cheh returns to the hunting lodge to tell the true story. =Chapters 25 ‚Äì 33= Princess Anna receives a false letter from Yurand, written by Danveld, asking for Danusia's return to him at Spyhov. Princess Anna decides they should get married first and the ceremony takes place and then Danusia departs. Zbyshko, when recovered, makes for Prince Yanush's castle at Tsehanov and help to save Yurand from death in a severe snowstorm; on his recovery he learns that Yurand never sent the letter and Yurand is certain the Knights of the Cross have abducted his daughter and the two men set of for Spyhov. A sister of the Order and pilgrim come to Yurand and say he has to humble himself before the Order and make a ransom. After some days Zbyshko finds out from Tolima, Yurand's faithful old servant, that his master has left. At the castle in Schytno, Yurand is forced to wait outside its gate all night as the onlookers jeer at him. The next morning he is allowed to enter and is forced to kneel dressed in a hempen bag before the comtur, Danveld. At last they bring his daughter to him but it is an idiot woman and, in his rage, he kills Danveld and massacres many of the jeering on- lookers before he is severely wounded and trapped in a net. Siegfried takes charge and sends Rotgier to Prince Yanush at Tsehanov to give a false version of the events. Zbyshko challenges Rotgier and kills him in their duel. =Chapters 34 ‚Äì 50= Zbyshko and De Lorche set out for Malburg to challenge the Knights there and learns from the priest at Spyhov that Yurand has bequeathed all his lands to Danusia and, in case of her death, to Zbyshko. He also sends off a letter to Matsko via Hlava at Zgorzelitse. At Schytno Siegfried receives the body of Rotgier who is almost a son to him and in revenge has his mute servant, Diedrich, Yurand's tongue cut out, his one eye blinded and his right arm cut off and then he is let loose on the road. Matsko, after consulting with Hlava, decides to make for Spyhov and takes Yagenka with him disguised as a young servant. At Plotsk Matsko befriends Lichtenstein in order to get a letter of safe conduct through the Knight's territory. They receive news about Zbyshko and decide to make for Schytno. On the road they encounter the blind Yurand and, deciding to take him back to Spyhov, are able to restore him to some degree of health. At Spyhov, they learn from Father Kaleb that Zbyshko, after some at Malborg where he fell under the protection of the Grand Master's brother, has joined Prince Vitold's forces. Matsko resolves to go to Warsaw. =Chapters 51 ‚Äì 55= War has broken out between the Grand Prince Vitold and the Knights over the latter's treatment of the Jmud people. The forces of Skirvoillo, the leader of the Jmud men, assemble and Matsko and Hlava are reunited with Zbyshko. Skirvoillo plans an attack on a castle and Zbyshko and Matsko are instructed the ambush forces coming out of the castle, Gotteswerder, to the support of a relief column. The Germans are wiped out, De Lorche is taken prisoner but freed by Zbyshko, and they learn from Sanderus, their prisoner, that Danusia is alive and has been carried off by Siegfried and a knight, Arnold von Baden. They pursue them and capture the Germans at some tarburners‚Äô huts but Danusia is ill and has lost her mind. They in turn are captured by German relief forces ‚Äì led by Arnold's brother, Wolfgang ‚Äì and Zbyshko and Matsko agree a ransom with their captors, enabling Zbyshko and Danusia to follow Hlava who was fortunately instructed to take Siegried directly to Spyhov. Hlava gets their first and recounts to Yagenka what has happened and takes his prisoner to Yurand who, by God's grace, frees him. Tolima accompanies the German to the border and the old man hangs himself from a tree, overcome by all his ill-deeds. =Chapters 56 ‚Äì 63= Just outside Spyhov Danusia dies. Yurand lies on his bed unable to move but smiling all the time and Zbyshko falls into a deep torpor. Tolima is sent off with a ransom to free Matsko from Malborg but is himself imprisoned in a comtur's prison and Father Kaleb and De Lorche, who has come to Spyhov to pray for Danusia, persuade Zbyshko to go. They learn about a meeting between King Yagiello and the Grand Master at Ratsiondz and Zybshko learns from Hlava, who returns to Spyhov, about Yagenka who has removed to the Bishop at Plotsk. At Plotsk, Yagiello is present and Prince Yanush and Prince Anna Danuta. Zbyshko see Yagenka who is now in the retinue of Princess Alexandra of Plotsk and she has changed greatly, transformed into a beautiful and elegant noblewoman. A great feast is held and the next day Prince Yanush commands Zbyshko and De Lorche to join his escort for the hunt. The meeting at Ratsiondz on an island on the Vistula takes place and goes badly for Grand Master Conrad and the Knights of the Order. Through Prince Yamont, Zbyshko is able to get his uncle's case raised by the King and he accompanies two other Polish knights to Malborg for the exchange of prisoners. Povala and particularly Zyndram, the leader of the Polish army, are unimpressed by the castle despite its huge size and the host of foreign knights present within its walls. Zbyshko and Matsko are reunited at last and the old man learns of Danusia's death. =Chapters 64 ‚Äì 69= On their return to Spyhov, Yurand dies. A decision is made to leave Hlava, along with Yagenka's handmaiden Anulka with whom he is in love, in charge of Spyhov as Matsko and Yagenka return to Bogdanets with a large stock of money and valuables ‚Äì mostly captured by Yurand from the Germans in battle ‚Äì and Zbyshko goes off to join Prince Vitold's forces. Many months pass as they wait for Zbyshko's return and Matsko resolves to build a castle for his nephew. =Chapters 70 ‚Äì 75= Matsko and old Vilk are reunited after the death of the latter's son attacking a German castle. Zbyshko returns to Bogdanets but lies ill on his bed and Matsko finally discerns that he loves Yagenka but does not know how to tell her. Finally, rising from his bed Yagenka takes responsibility for cutting his hair and the two are united. The couple live in Mochydoly while the castle is being built for them in Bogdanets and Yagenka gives birth to twins, Matsko and Yasko, and start to become renowned in the region once they move into the castle in its fifth year after all the outbuildings are completed. =Chapters 76 ‚Äì 81= In the same year war is afoot. Matsko leaves for Spyhov and is gone for six months. On his return, Zbyshko learns that he went on to Malborg to challenge Lichtenstein to a duel but failed as the latter had been appointed grand comtur and was not present ‚Äì instead he fought and killed Lichtenstein's relative of the same name. A dispute is raised between Poland the Knights over the castle of Drezdenko that the greedy Order have captured and refused to return which Matsko thinks will result in all out war. Immense hunts are ordered by the Yagiello to supply dried meat for the army and many Mazovians flee from Prussia to escape the Knights‚Äô iron rule. Vitold is appointed to review the dispute and adjudges it to the Poles and Jmud again breaks out in rebellion. The armies of Lithuania and Poland are united along with the regiments of Mazovia against the Germans at their camp at Sviet. A general battle is coming and, after capturing the German fortress of Dambrova, the army makes camp and the next morning reach the fields of Grunwald where the armies halt to rest. As Yagello is about to start his second mass, scouts appear confirming the arrival of the Germans. During the bloody battle, The Grand Master Ulrich is killed by Lithuanian soldiers and many famous knights of the Western Order captured. Matsko searches the field for Kuno Lichtenstein and finds him amongst some captured prisoners and, after challenging him to a duel, kills him with his misericordia. The novel ends with Matsko and Zbyshko returning to Bogdanets where the former lives a long life with his four grandsons around him and the latter witnessing the Grand Master of the Order leaving Malborg with tears in his eyes from one gate as the Polish voevoda enters through another.

Some jurisdictions specifically use the term \\"confiscation\\" instead of forfeiture. The alleged purpose of asset forfeiture is to disrupt criminal activity by confiscating assets that potentially could have been beneficial to the individual or organization. Civil and criminal law Legal systems distinguish between criminal and civil proceedings. Criminal prosecutions regulate crimes against society as a whole or against the government. Penalties for conviction of a violation of a criminal law typically include being sent to prison, jail or some other form of incarceration. Civil litigation involves disputes either between individuals or individuals and the government. At the conclusion of civil litigation one side can be ordered to pay money [damages] to the other side. Courts also have the authority to order one party to do or not do a specific thing in order to resolve civil disputes. Because of the potential for a loss of liberty, defendants in a criminal case will be provided an attorney at public expense if they are unable to pay for their own lawyer. The same is generally not true in civil cases although there are exceptions. In order for an individual to be found guilty of a crime the government has to provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt. There are several standards of proof in a civil case, the most common is a preponderance of the evidence which is described as anything over fifty percent. Civil asset forfeiture has been harshly criticized by civil liberties advocates for its greatly reduced standards for conviction, reverse onus, and financial conflicts of interests arising when the law enforcement agencies who decide whether or not to seize assets stand to keep those assets for themselves. Canada Part XII.2 of the Criminal Code, a federal statute, provides a national forfeiture r√©gime for property arising from the commission of a designated offence (i.e. most indictable offences), subsequent to conviction. Provision is also made for the use of restraint and management orders to govern such property during the course of a criminal proceeding. All provinces and territories except Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island and Yukon Territory, have also enacted statutes to provide for similar civil forfeiture r√©gimes. These generally provide, on a balance of probabilities basis, for the seizure of property: * Acquired from the results of unlawful activity * Is likely to be used to engage in unlawful activity The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld civil forfeiture laws as a valid exercise of the provincial government power over property and civil rights. The extent to which the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to civil forfeiture statutes is still under dispute. To the extent that such laws are applied for a \\"punitive\\" purpose, there is case law to suggest that the Charter applies. In cases where evidence has been obtained illegally, courts in Alberta and British Columbia have excluded such evidence. European Union In April 2014, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union enacted Directive 2014/42/EU on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the European Union. The directive allows the seizure and confiscation of property without a criminal conviction only under very specific circumstances. Article 4 states: # Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable the confiscation, either in whole or in part, of instrumentalities and proceeds or property the value of which corresponds to such instrumentalities or proceeds, subject to a final conviction for a criminal offence, which may also result from proceedings in absentia. # Where confiscation on the basis of paragraph 1 is not possible, at least where such impossibility is the result of illness or absconding of the suspected or accused person, Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable the confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds in cases where criminal proceedings have been initiated regarding a criminal offence which is liable to give rise, directly or indirectly, to economic benefit, and such proceedings could have led to a criminal conviction if the suspected or accused person had been able to stand trial. United Kingdom In the UK, asset forfeiture proceedings are initiated under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. These fall into various types. Firstly there are confiscation proceedings. A confiscation order is a court order made in the Crown Court requiring a convicted defendant to pay a specified amount of money to the state by a specified date. Secondly, there are cash forfeiture proceedings, which take place (in England and Wales) in the Magistrates Court with a right of appeal to the Crown Court, having been brought by either the police or customs. Thirdly, there are civil recovery proceedings that are brought by the National Crime Agency \\"NCA\\". Neither cash forfeiture proceedings nor proceedings for a civil recovery order require a prior criminal conviction. In Scotland, confiscation proceedings are initiated by the procurator fiscal or Lord Advocate through the Sheriff Court or High Court of Justiciary. Cash forfeiture and civil recovery are brought by the Civil Recovery Unit of the Scottish Government in the Sheriff Court, with appeals to the Court of Session. United Nations Convention against Corruption To facilitate international cooperation in confiscation, the United Nations Convention against Corruption encourages state parties to consider taking the necessary measures to allow confiscation of the proceeds of corruption without a criminal conviction in cases in which the offender cannot be prosecuted by reason of death, flight or absence or in other appropriate cases.Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the European Union (COM/2012/085) at EUR-LexUnited Nations Convention against Corruption ¬ß 54(1)(c) United States There are two types of forfeiture (confiscation) cases, criminal and civil. Approximately half of all forfeiture cases practiced today are civil, although many of those are filed in parallel to a related criminal case. In civil forfeiture cases, the US government sues the item of property, not the person; the owner is effectively a third-party claimant. The burden is on the government to establish that the property is subject to forfeiture by a \\"preponderance of the evidence.\\" If it is successful, the owner may yet prevail by establishing an \\"innocent owner\\" defense. Federal civil forfeiture cases usually start with a seizure of property followed by the mailing of a notice of seizure from the seizing agency (generally the DEA or FBI) to the owner. The owner then has 35 days to file a claim with the seizing agency. The owner must file this claim to later protect his property in court. Once the claim is filed with the agency, the U.S. Attorney has 90 days to review the claim and to file a civil complaint in U.S. District Court. The owner then has 35 days to file a judicial claim in court asserting his ownership interest. Within 21 days of filing the judicial claim, the owner must also file an answer denying the allegations in the complaint. Once done, the forfeiture case is fully litigated in court.18 United States Code 983(a) & Rule G, Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions In civil cases, the owner need not be judged guilty of any crime; it is possible for the government to prevail by proving that someone other than the owner used the property to commit a crime (this claim seems outdated and as such would be contradicted by the \\"innocent owner\\" defense). In contrast, criminal forfeiture is usually carried out in a sentence following a conviction and is a punitive act against the offender. The United States Marshals Service is responsible for managing and disposing of properties seized and forfeited by Department of Justice agencies. It currently manages around $2.4 billion worth of property. The United States Treasury Department is responsible for managing and disposing of properties seized by Treasury agencies. The goal of both programs is to maximize the net return from seized property by selling at auctions and to the private sector and then using the property and proceeds to repay victims of crime and, if any funds remain after compensating victims, for law enforcement purposes. =History= Congress has incrementally expanded the government's authority to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises and their money- laundering activities since the early 1970s. They have done this by enacting various anti-money-laundering and forfeiture laws such as the RICO Act of 1970 and the USA Patriot Act of 2001. The concepts of asset forfeiture goes back thousands of years and has been recorded throughout history on many occasions.\\"In Depth: Where the Money Goes: Forfeiture proceeds buy small luxuries, but no slush\\". Chris D Edoardo & A.D. Hopk. Las Vegas Review‚ÄìJournal. Las Vegas, Nevada. 1 Apr 2001. p. 27A. In 2015 a number of criminal justice reformers, including Koch family foundations and the ACLU, announced plans to reduce asset forfeiture in the United States due to the disproportionate penalty it places on low-income alleged wrongdoers. The forfeiture of private property often results in the deprivation of the majority of a person's wealth. =Forfeiture of terrorist finances= It is difficult for authorities to track, confiscate, and disrupt terrorist- organization finances because they may come from a variety of sources‚Äîsuch as other countries, supporting sympathizers, crime, or legal businesses. Terrorist groups can profit from many crimes‚Äîsuch as black mail, robbery, extortion, fraud, drug trafficking, etc. If discovered and proven terrorist assets, authorities can confiscate property to disrupt terrorist activities. Understanding what constitutes 'terrorist property' is important, because these offenses are widely defined by the 2000 Act as;\\" # Property or money that is likely to be used for the purposes of terrorism (including any resources of an organization) # Proceeds of the commission of acts of terrorism # Proceeds of acts actually carried out for the purposes of terrorism.\\"\\"The Confiscation, Forfeiture and Disruption of Terrorist Finances\\". Bell, R.E.. Journal of Money Laundering Control. 7.2 (Autumn 2003): 105‚Äì25. The 2000 Act brought a new system for the forfeiture of terrorist cash. This was modeled on the UK's drug-trafficking cash-seizure process and allowed for the seizure of cash for 48 hours by a constable, customs officer or immigration officer if reasonable grounds were found for suspecting that it was intended to be used for terrorism or was terrorist property. An officer who seized the assets or cash could apply to a magistrates' court for an order authorizing its continued detention to give time for further investigation into where it came from. The magistrates' court is generally satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the cash was intended to be used for the purposes of terrorism or was terrorist property, then it could make a forfeiture order. =Use of forfeited assets= The assets that are forfeited for criminal and civil offenses are used \\"to put more cops on the street,\\" according to former United States President George H. W. Bush. The assets are dispersed among the law enforcement community for things such as paying the attorneys involved in the forfeiture case, police vehicles, meth-lab clean up, and other equipment and furniture. =Notable forfeitures= * In 1965, the United States Supreme Court overturned the seizure of a vehicle by the Government of Pennsylvania in One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania seized using illegally obtained evidence. * In 1996, the Supreme Court in Bennis v. Michigan upheld the seizure of a vehicle as contraband, despite the owner's use of the innocent owner defense. * USA v. $124,700 August 18, 2006 case from the Eighth Circuit Court on civil forfeiture of $124,700 * After the Madoff investment scandal had surfaced, Bernard Madoff was ordered to forfeit $170 billion, although it is believed that he did not have anywhere close to that amount. His wife, Ruth, although not charged, agreed to forfeit about $80 million in assets. * In 2009, Lloyds Bank forfeited $350 million in connection with violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (falsified outgoing wire transfers to persons on U.S. sanctions lists). * In 2009, Credit Suisse, a Swiss corporation, forfeited $536 million in connection with violations of IEEPA. * In 2010, Barclays Bank forfeited $298 million in connection with violations of the IEEPA and the Trading with the Enemy Act. * In 2010, ABN Amro Bank forfeited $500 million in connection with violations of the IEEPA and the Trading with the Enemy Act. * In 2013, an appellate court overruled the civil forfeiture of Motel Caswell by Boston-area federal prosecutors in United States v. 434 Main Street, Tewksbury, Mass. Despite a number of previous drug crimes committed on the property by outside parties, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that the \\"resolution of the crime problem should not be to simply take [the owner's] Property.\\" * On April 17, 2014, the State of Texas seized the YFZ Ranch, a one time Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) community that housed as many as 700 people when it was raided by Texas on March 29, 2008. Under Texas law, authorities can seize property that was used to commit or facilitate certain criminal conduct.

He first appeared in 1999 as a police constable, sergeant, and eventually became inspector. Character history Smith first arrived at Sun Hill police station as a police constable (PC), having served with the Queen's Royal Fusiliers. He later left Sun Hill to take up a position in the Specialist Firearms Command (then known as SO19), but returned two years later as a sergeant. In 2009 he was promoted to inspector after Rachel Weston took up a position with Superintendent John Heaton's People Trafficking Unit. Storylines =Constable at Sun Hill= In 2001 Smith left Sun Hill because he felt that the many new rules Superintendent Tom Chandler was introducing prevented him from enforcing the law. When Sergeant Bob Cryer, who had also served with the Fusiliers, encouraged him to pursue his ambition to become an armed police officer and gave him the highest possible grading, Smith submitted his SO19 application. Meanwhile, Smith and PC Nick Klein were frequently called out to the home of Frank Kennedy, an elderly man whose house was continually being vandalized by youths. Kennedy accused the police of doing nothing about it and threatened to tackle the youths himself. To Nick‚Äôs surprise, Smith showed sympathy towards Kennedy, as he suspected property developers were paying youths to harass residents that were refusing to move, like Kennedy. On one such call-out, Smith and Klein found that Kennedy had shot a young intruder dead. Klein's report to Chandler led to an allegation that Smith had encouraged Kennedy to take the law into his own hands. Believing he had lost his chance to get into SO19, Smith assaulted Nick, accusing him of being a grass and showing no loyalty. Consequently, Smith was suspended from duty. While the Kennedy shooting was under investigation, Smith, although suspended, went under cover and, with the support of Bob Cryer, managed to expose the conspiracy between the developers and the youths. Cryer researched Kennedy‚Äôs past and discovered that he had a criminal record for dealing in firearms. This was enough for Cryer to persuade Kennedy‚Äôs lawyer to drop the allegation against Smith. Upon Smith‚Äôs return to duty after being cleared, Chandler approved his application to join SO19. =SO19= On Smith‚Äôs first day with SO19 after completing his training, a man called Chris Finnessey, who had been refused access to his son, had taken Cryer and school teacher Rachel Bonington hostage and was demanding to see his son. In an attempt to avoid fatalities, Chandler handed the boy over to his father in exchange for Bonington. When Finnessey tried to escape in a getaway car with his son and a handcuffed Cryer, he was attacked by his enraged wife, who was trying to retrieve her son. Smith opened fire on Finnessey when he saw him trying to stab his wife, but at the same time Cryer jumped in the way, trying to separate Finnessey and his wife, and Smith's shot hit Cryer. As a result of his injury, Cryer was forced to retire on grounds of ill health. Cryer bore no malice, and he encouraged his other colleagues to take the same view. Smith's superiors agreed that Cryer's shooting was not a result of any incompetence, and Smith was allowed to continue his work with SO19. =Return to Sun Hill and promotion to sergeant= Two years later, in 2003, Smithy returned to Sun Hill as the new sergeant, after the death of Sergeant Matthew Boyden, who served at the station from 1991‚Äì2003. He formed a very close friendship and working relationship with Inspector Gina Gold, but he was accused of homophobia and racism, and he joined PC Gabriel Kent's 'SWAMP' (Straight White Male Police Association). However, he then showed a more sensitive side when he was the one to find out that DC Mickey Webb had been raped by Martin Delaney. =Kerry Young= On Smith's first day as sergeant, he kissed PC Kerry Young. They agreed to go out for a drink, but then he backed out, saying that a romantic relationship between a Sergeant and a PC would not work. While observing on a gang of teenage joyriders, Young seduced Smith in the car, but they were caught half naked on the back seat. Thereafter Smith stated that their relationship should remain strictly professional. Young began a relationship with PC Cameron Tait, of which Smith grew increasingly jealous. After an argument during a drinking session, Young and Smith had a one-night stand. Seizing the opportunity to make trouble, Gabriel Kent manipulated Young into thinking that Smith had raped her, and pressed her to make an official allegation. She decided against it, but Kent spread word around the station. Andrea Dunbar leaked the rumour to the press, and the station was divided. Even when Young realized that Smith was incapable of rape and dropped the allegation, his reputation was severely tainted. Young discovered that Kent was working in the police under a false identity and that Dunbar was an undercover journalist. Planning to reveal all she knew before resigning from the Police Force, Young declared her love for Smith. Moments later, however, determined to stop Young from exposing him, Kent shot her from the rooftop with a sniper rifle. She died with Smith at her side shortly after arriving at the hospital. =Louise Larson= While investigating a car theft, Smith met Louise Larson, wife of gangster Pete Larson. He was frustrated by her unhelpfulness, but also attracted to her, and they embarked on an affair. When Pete Larson found out, Smith was abducted at gunpoint, beaten up, bound, gagged and driven in the boot of a car to an empty warehouse. Larson attempted to shoot him there, but the Specialist Firearms Command arrived in time to rescue him. Louise refused to testify against her husband and broke off her relationship with Smith. She changed her mind about testifying several months later, but this meant she would have to go into witness protection, and she asked Smith to move to Australia with her. However, she was killed in a hit and run incident, for which Larson tried to frame Smith. Smith was suspended from duty and charged with Louise's murder after being identified as the driver of the vehicle by a witness named Caplin. Smith was remanded in custody but, even there, he could not stop policing, and tried to help his cellmate who was wrongly accused of drug dealing inside the prison. Meanwhile, Smith's colleagues at Sun Hill tried to prove his innocence. As a result of their work, Caplin finally admitted to lying in an attempt to solve his debt problems ‚Äì Larson had given him a loan in exchange for accusing Smith. Larson was arrested at Louise's funeral and Smith later returned to his job at Sun Hill. =Relationship with Kezia Walker= Smith had a brief affair with DC Kezia Walker ‚Äì an open relationship without ties. When Kezia's lease expired and she was about to be made homeless, Smith offered her a room to rent. However, they soon drifted apart, and eventually split up amicably. =Acting Inspector= Smith was temporarily promoted to acting inspector when Inspector Gold took a few weeks' leave. On his first day in the job, there was an armed robbery, an escaped convict on the loose and the funeral of a supermodel, which required high-visibility police presence. In addition, PC Beth Green was taken hostage and had a complaint made against her. When Callum Stone arrived for his first day as sergeant, a criminal fended off the officers holding him for processing and tried to escape. Stone arrived at the right moment and fought the criminal to the ground. When Smith emerged from his office, all he saw was two men fighting. He restrained Stone with a headlock, only realising that Stone was a police officer when he displayed his warrant card to Smith. When Gold returned, Smith was relieved of his additional duties and returned to the rank of sergeant. =Carly Samuels= Smith had known sixteen-year-old Carly Samuels since she witnessed a crime on the Jasmine Allen Estate. At a party that became rowdy, Smith recognised her as she was leaving, and stopped her for more information. He was horrified when she was murdered in a drive-by shooting. The police recovered the car used in the murder and found bullet casings that did not match up with the bullet that killed her, meaning that at least two guns must have been used. Detective Inspector Neil Manson suspected that Samuels had just got in the way of a revenge attack on her boyfriend Marlon Reed, by a man he attacked, Tito Morientes. Manson had the local canal searched, and a 9mm automatic pistol was recovered. On the way to the murder trial, Smith's car was deliberately run off the road, causing it to flip over. When he eventually reached the trial, it was put to him that his relationship with the Samuels family was unprofessional. One of the accused, Carly's ex Dwayne Fox, changed his plea to guilty midway through the trial, with the other suspect, Tito, calling him a grass. Smith once again came across Carly's mother Leanne, a year later during the investigation to an assault. =Gun Runner= Smith went under cover as a gun runner called Lawrence Smith in order to expose a gun smuggling operation. DC Stevie Moss also went under cover, posing as Lawrence's girlfriend and providing information to DS Max Carter. The operation ended when Smith shot Kieran Wallace, a dangerous criminal who became a major risk to the public when Smith exposed himself as an undercover police officer. =Stabbed= While investigating an arson attack on a school, Smith and PC Nate Roberts rescued a girl who was being beaten up by two boys in the local park. When the thugs ran off in different directions, the officers split up and chased after them. Smith was stabbed and sustained serious injuries: a lung was punctured and collapsed, and he lost four pints of blood. Smith positively identified his attacker. It turned out that the fight in the park was over nothing more than a stolen iPhone. Smith recovered from his injuries and, after a short break, returned to work. The two men were later arrested. =The Devlins= While Smith and Callum Stone were investigating a series of crimes in the Sun Hill area, Jason Devlin and his father Matthew came to their attention. They suspected the Devlins of an assault, but could not gather sufficient evidence to arrest them. Then, when the CID investigated an illegal immigrant trafficking scheme which had resulted in death, DCI Jack Meadows and DI Neil Manson suspected the Devlins were controlling it. When Jason Devlin \\"discovered\\" these illegal immigrants in his flats, he kicked them out, causing a riot. During this riot, DC Stevie Moss escorted Jason back to his car, and when she tried to examine a bag in the boot, he beat her up. Witnessing this, Smith became enraged, and he in turn beat up Devlin. Stone arrived moments later to find Moss and Devlin unconscious and Smith staring at Devlin in despair. Stone persuaded him to keep quiet about the incident, on the grounds that Devlin deserved what he got and Smith was too good a policeman to lose, but Devlin made a complaint of assault against Smith, and a witness was found to corroborate it. However, Smith's colleagues found enough evidence to arrest Matthew Devlin for kidnapping a little girl in order to intimidate another witness against Jason, who faced other charges. When Jason's barrister expressed disbelief at Smith's account of events, he simply replied that that was why he was a police officer and she (the barrister) was not. After the key witness for Sun Hill arrived at court to give evidence, even after intimidation by the Devlins, Jason changed his plea to guilty. =Promotion to Inspector= During the Devlin investigation, Superintendent John Heaton announced that he was leaving Sun Hill and asked Rachel Weston, DS Stuart Turner and Kezia Walker to join him. Jack Meadows, the newly appointed Superintendent, asked Smith to be the new Inspector. The first major incident Smith had to deal with after his promotion was a brawl outside a nightclub. An allegation of assault during this brawl caused Callum Stone to be suspended. Smith's fellow officers felt that he and Sergeant Jo Masters were failing to support Stone, and both started to lose the respect of their teams, respect was regained when Nate Roberts overheard Masters defending the team during an argument with Max Carter. Later, when PC Mel Ryder rescued a young boy from drowning in a flooded drain, she herself then became trapped, putting her life in jeopardy. Smith, however, entered the drain and rescued the young PC, to a hero's applause.

The novel is set sixteen years after the events of the Trilogy, and covers a period of about two years. It chronicles the events that ultimately lead to Takeo's downfall, in accordance with the prophecy spoken of him years before. Synopsis Otori Takeo and Kaede are now the prosperous rulers of the Three Countries. Shigeko, their eldest daughter and heir, will inherit the domain of Maruyama when she comes of age, and the Three Countries upon Takeo's death. Their younger daughters Maya and Miki are seen as cursed, due to superstitions concerning twins and their formidable Tribe talents. Although shunned by many, including their mother, they are loved by Takeo and Shigeko. Takeo's only fear is the prophecy concerning his death: he can only be killed by his son. His first, illegitimate son, Hisao (by Yuki) has been raised among the Kikuta, to one day be used to assassinate him. Kaede soon gives birth to Takeo's second son. A new threat to Takeo has appeared. Takeo's vassal Arai Zenko and his wife Hana (Kaede's sister) have approached Saga Hideki, a warlord who has conquered most of the Eight Islands in the name of the powerless Emperor. Saga demands that Takeo submit himself to the Emperor and abdicate; before departing for the Capital, Takeo has Zenko publicly submit to him. Meanwhile Kikuta Akio, the Master of the exiled Kikuta family, seeks to destroy Takeo. Muto Kenji, at the end of his years, attempts in vain to negotiate with Akio to see his grandson, Hisao. As Kenji attempts to flee with him he realizes Hisao is a ghostmaster, capable of communicating with the souls of the dead. The soul of his mother, Yuki, is haunting him. Unable to escape Akio, Kenji commits suicide. His death divides the Muto family's loyalty between Kenji's niece Shizuka (the mother of Zenko and Taku, loyal to Takeo) and Zenko, who secretly shelters Akio and Hisao in his capital of Kumamoto. Zenko has also converted to Christianity in order to gain military support from Portuguese missionaries who Takeo has restricted to the port of Hofu. Maya, whose Tribe talents are rather volatile, absorbs the spirit of a cat and struggles to control it, becoming increasingly erratic and dangerous. She and Miki are separated, and Maya is trained under Taku. Taku is soon killed on Zenko's orders and Maya is captured by Akio. Hisao, who exercises some control over Maya's cat spirit, is finally able to communicate with Yuki's spirit, but rejects her pleas to spare Takeo's life. Maya escapes aided by Miki, and they attempt to return to Hagi (the Otori capital) to reveal Zenko's treachery. They are aided in their journey by Yuki's spirit. Rather than battle Saga's forces, Takeo and his retinue travel to the Imperial capital, Miyako, to engage in a bowmanship contest: the victor will rule the Three Countries. Due to Takeo's crippled hand, Shigeko takes his place. Shigeko wins, and Takeo departs in glory, leaving behind an exotic animal, a Kirin (likely a giraffe or an okapi), as a gift for the Emperor. However, the Kirin breaks free and follows Takeo's entourage, which is seen as an omen and a slight on the Emperor. Saga immediately pursues them. In the resulting battle, both sides enduring great losses until Shigeko shoots Saga in the eye, and he retreats. Maya, influenced by Yuki, slips into her parents' house and accidentally kills her infant brother with the Kikuta gaze; horrified, she flees. While Kaede is overcome with grief, Hana reveals the prophecy about Takeo's death, and the existence of Hisao. Furious, Kaede orders Shigeru's house burned to the ground, then leaves with Hana and her sons as Zenko's men destroy Hagi. After abdicating in favor of Shigeko, Takeo finds Kaede and tries to reason with her, but she calls the guards. Unwilling to fight his wife, Takeo retires to the temple at Terayama with Miki and his old friend Kubo Makoto. A few weeks later, Akio and Hisao come to kill him, but Hisao, armed with a handmade pistol, freezes and refuses to kill his father. Akio grabs the pistol, but Maya (trapped in her cat form) interferes, causing the gun to explode and kill them both. Takeo places a knife in Hisao's hands and stabs himself with it, bringing the prophecy of his death to fulfillment. He is ritually beheaded by Makoto with Jato (the Otori sword) and buried with honor, next to Shigeru. Following Takeo's abdication, an impressed Saga offers Shigeko a marriage-alliance allowing her to remain co-ruler in the Three Countries, which she accepts. The combined Saga and Otori armies defeat the Arai forces. Zenko and Hana commit seppuku, along with their youngest son, but at Kaede's request, Saga spares their other two sons as long as they renounce the Arai name. Kaede brings the boys to Terayama, where Makoto shows her his recorded account of Takeo's death. Overcome with guilt and grief, she prepares to commit suicide. Only Miki's appearance makes her decide to live, for the sake of all of Takeo's children.  Characters  Otori Takeo was the protagonist of The Tales of the Otori. He is married to Shirakawa Kaede and is the wealthy ruler of the Three Countries. Takeo and Kaede practice benevolent and enlightened rule, rigidly controlling foreign trade and focusing on agriculture rather than conquest. Having been raised among the Hidden, the Tribe and the warrior class, Takeo is careful to follow no particular religion in order to prevent religious persecution. Although beloved by the commonfolk throughout his realm and approved by most of his retainers and many of the Muto family, he remains hated by the Kikuta family and the Arai Clan. He has three daughters, Shigeko, Maya, and Miki, and one illegitimate son: Kikuta Hisao, conceived by Muto Yuki, a past lover. He perishes at the end of the book after abdicating in favour of Maruyama Shigeko. Otori Kaede (formerly Shirakawa Kaede) is Takeo's wife. She had a reputation of bringing death to all men that desired her, but Takeo had evaded death for some time. Kaede, despite being a woman in a male-dominated society, is proficient with both the sword and politics. She loves Shigeko dearly, but she harbors mistrust for her twin daughters and can only love them from a distance. Since she was not able to bear Takeo any sons, she is overjoyed when she later gives birth to a boy. But when the child dies mysteriously, her sister Hana tells her about Takeo's brief liaison with Muto Yuki, the son that was conceived, and the prophecy which foretells Takeo's death can only occur at the hands of his own son. Kaede violently rejects Takeo thereafter, only to mourn his death when she regains her sanity and proves that she still indeed loves him. She finally manages to reconcile with Miki (her only surviving child besides Shigeko) at the end of the book. Otori Shigeko (later Maruyama Shigeko) is the eldest daughter of Takeo and Kaede, a wise and reverent young woman. She had been trained as a boy as a child in hopes of her inheriting the Three Countries as she came of age. She is the heir and lady of the estates of Maruyama. Although she is much her mother's daughter, she loves her father and sisters dearly. Shigeko has always been fascinated by her sisters and always took their side of things. She is an expert archer and is in love with her senior retainer and teacher, Sugita Hiroshi. However, at the end of the novel, she becomes betrothed to Saga Hideki, the Emperor's commander, and inherits control the Three Countries and Takeo's sword, Jato. Otori Maya is the daughter of Takeo and Kaede, and the twin of Miki. As a twin, she and her sister have been feared or frowned upon because of superstitious beliefs. She is very mischievous and possesses most, if not all, of Takeo's Tribe abilities. Because her mother fears Maya and Miki being together, one of them was always with the Tribe for training. As revenge for a man heartily welcoming Shigeko and blatantly ignoring the twins, Maya kills his cat with the Kikuta gaze and ends up taking the dead cat's spirit within her. After a great deal of practice, she eventually is able to take on the cat's form, but is continually haunted by cat's spirit threatening to take control of her. She accidentally kills her baby brother with the Kikuta gaze, which horrifies her so much she retreats permanently into the cat spirit. She is mortally wounded by Akio at the end of the book in an attempt to protect her father; Miki then mercy-kills her to prevent her being a cat spirit forever. Otori Miki is the daughter of Takeo and Kaede, and the twin of Maya. She, being the younger of the two, was to be killed after she was born, but Takeo had forbidden it. Although she loves her mother, sisters, and father dearly, her mother is somewhat afraid of her. Miki had always been in the shadow of the more talented Maya, but had been quite comfortable with it. She is less mischievous and daring and more thoughtful and pragmatic than Maya; while she has a fiery temper, her twin is considered the colder and less forgiving twin. When together, they were inseparable. However, at the end of the novel, Miki was forced to kill her sister. Her mother finally accepts Miki at the end of the novel, when Kaede realizes that Miki still needs her. Kikuta Hisao is the son of Takeo and Muto Yuki, and sixteen years old and, according to a prophecy, will be the one who kills Takeo. He had grown up believing he was the son of Akio, the Kikuta Master. Despite the talents of his mother and father, Hisao possesses no obvious talents like invisibility or the Kikuta hearing and was subjected to harsh training by Akio in hopes of compensating. He is by nature gentle and loves animals, which Akio cruelly punishes him for, and is innately talented at constructing tools, even if it is as complex as a gun. Muto Kenji, his maternal grandfather, discovers only as he dies in Hisao's presence that Hisao is a ghostmaster, a rare talent of the Tribe and that Yuki's spirit remains bound to him as a result. He is not able to hear his mother's pleas until his half-sister Maya aids him in her spirit form. Akio attempts to force him to shoot Takeo with a gun at the end of the novel, but it is Takeo who guides his son's hand with a dagger to kill Takeo and fulfill the prophecy. Hisao is later taken in by the monks at Terayama. Madaren is the youngest half-sister of Takeo. She is an interpreter and lover of a visiting foreigner. After the Hidden were attacked, Madaren had been sold as a servant in one of the pleasure houses. She had learned to take advantage of them, and stole from them, eventually allowing a merchant to take her to Hofu. Returning to the pleasure houses to gain income, she was eventually bought by Don Jo√£o, a Portuguese foreigner. Madaren got him to teach her their language, and she soon became fluent. She tried desperately to get her brother to convert back to the Hidden religion, with no success. She teaches Kaede the foreigners' language. As the foreigners and their religion were banished from the Three Countries by Shigeko and Saga at the end of the book, her fate is unknown. Muto Shizuka is Takeo's cousin and the mother of Taku and Zenko, married to Dr. Ishida, Takeo's personal doctor. A skilled member of the Tribe, she is close friends with Kaede and a surrogate mother to Miki and Maya. When Muto Kenji is killed by Akio and the Kikuta clan, Takeo asks that she take on the role of the Master of the Muto clan. While she is respected by the Tribe, the decision is met with dislike from the Muto, Kuroda, and Imai clans, who feel that it is wrong for the new master to be chosen from outside the Tribe and it goes against tradition for a woman to lead, especially since Taku or Zenko would be eligible. When Taku is killed and Shizuka is betrayed by Zenko, she goes to mourn for Taku and fasts at a temple. Her suffering gains her much sympathy and causes many members of the Tribe to defect from Zenko. Muto Taku is Shizuka's younger son and spymaster for the Muto, a close friend of Sugita Hiroshi. He is a talented member of the Tribe and well-trusted by Takeo. When Maya's abilities become too uncontrollable, she is entrusted to Taku and his companion (and lover) Sada, who train her to control the cat's spirit and take on its form. His relationship with Zenko is strained and the two do not get along well. Most members of the Tribe feel that Taku should have been the Muto Master instead of Shizuka and his death at the hands of Akio is a heavy loss for Takeo. Arai Zenko is Shizuka's older son, Taku's older brother, and a retainer of Takeo and husband of Kaede's sister Hana. His relationship with his mother and brother are strained, though he still welcomes them as his family. As an outward gesture of loyalty, Zenko offers his sons Sunaomi and Chikara to be adopted by Takeo, knowing that they would be ineffective collateral against him because Takeo is unwilling to harm children. He is an ambitious and bitter man who still blames Takeo for the death of his father, Arai Daiichi. Zenko conspires to overthrow Takeo by several means: converting to Christianity in order to gain military support from foreign traders, allying with Akio, and declaring himself head of the Muto family after Kenji's death. While Takeo is busy fighting Saga Hideki, Zenko attacks the defenseless Otori lands, but he finally defeated by the combined armies of Saga and the Otori (who have formed an alliance). He eventually is forced to take his own life at the end of the novel. Arai Hana (formerly Shirakawa Hana) is Kaede's youngest sister and wife of Arai Zenko, and mother of their three sons: Sunaomi, Chikara, and Hiromasa, who possesses Kikuta lines on his palms. After being rejected by Takeo in her youth, she married Zenko and came to love him and shared his ambition to overthrow Takeo and Kaede. Like her older sister, Hana is unusually beautiful, which resulted in a rivalry between Zenko, Taku, and Hiroshi as to who would marry her in their youth. She reveals to Kaede the secret of Takeo's son and the prophecy concerning Takeo's death in order to create a rift between the two and crush Takeo's spirit. Hana takes her life at the end of the book, along with her youngest son. Her two older sons are saved by Kaede and to be raised at the temple of Terayama. Sugita Hiroshi is a loyal retainer of Takeo and Kaede, who has managed Maruyama in trust for Shigeko. He is in love with Shigeko, but does not pursue her hand in marriage because of his loyalty to Takeo and has not married any one else as a result. He and Taku have been close friends since childhood. When Hiroshi is badly injured in the battle against Saga Hideki, Shigeko attempts to kill Saga as revenge. Kikuta Akio is the Kikuta Master, a cruel man who adheres too severely to the traditions of the Tribe and kills all who try to leave the Tribe. He is driven by fact he had to kill the only woman he ever loved, Muto Yuki, who did not love him in return, and his hatred of Takeo to the point of irrationality and demands all members of the Tribe refer to Takeo as the \\"Dog\\"; he kills any Tribe members who wish to negotiate with Takeo. While he has raised Hisao as his own son, Akio treats him harshly and with little kindness, brutally killing even a cat that Hisao befriended as an example. He molests Hisao habitually. He forms an alliance with Zenko, who claims mastery of the Muto family, in order to kill Takeo. Akio is ultimately cheated of his revenge when he and Hisao finally confront Takeo; he impatiently snatches a pistol away from Hisao to kill Takeo, but the gun misfires and explodes, blowing Akio's hands off and killing him. Saga Hideki is a ruthless and pragmatic warlord from beyond the Three Countries. Having been declared the Emperor's general, he has conquered nearly all the rest of the \\"Eight Islands\\" on behalf of his powerless overlord, effectively making him sh≈çgun. Saga, prompted by Zenko and Fujiwara Kono, challenges the legitimacy of Takeo's rule, intending to either force Takeo to abdicate or to crush him in battle. This plan initially fails when Takeo wins the Emperor's favor, and his daughter Shigeko wins the bowmanship contest on which the matter was to be decided. However, when the Kirin Takeo gifted to the Emperor escapes and follows him, Saga takes the opportunity to attack, claiming the Kirin's preference of Takeo is an insult to the Emperor. After a costly battle, Saga retreats after Shigeko shoots him in the eye. Impressed by both her and Takeo, he offers a marriage-alliance with Shigeko against the Arai clan after Takeo abdicates; Shigeko agrees, on condition that they rule equally in the Three Countries. Muto Yuki (Muto Yusetsu) is the deceased mother of Kikuta Hisao and the daughter of Muto Kenji. When she was forced to kill herself, her spirit was bound to her infant son by his latent abilities as a ghostmaster. Because she loved Takeo, she continually begs Hisao, who tries to ignore her, not to kill his father. Hisao is only able to communicate with his mother with the help of Maya, but ends up rejecting Yuki's claims and severs her spirit. Yuki later appears to Maya and Miki as \\"Yusetsu\\" and becomes a surrogate mother to them as they try to return to Kaede and warn her of Hana and Zenko's treachery. Miki is wary of Yuki's intentions while Maya readily accepts the ghost woman's help until it is revealed that Yuki was using Maya to take revenge on Kaede. Yuki influences Maya to use the Kikuta sleep on her infant brother and steals the baby's spirit away, leaving Maya to give into the cat's spirit, devastated by the weight of her actions.

Orang Minyak literally means oily man in Malay. Legends According to Malay legend, Orang Minyak is a creature that abducts young women by night. Supposedly, the creature is able to climb walls and grab victims while evading capture due to its slippery coating. According to some folklorists, the Orang Minyak has been alternately described as appearing naked, or wearing \\"a black pair of swimming trunks\\". A number of stories describe the Orang Minyak as a rapist that only targets virgins. The Orang Minyak has been traditionally blamed for rapes, beginning in the 1950s, and superstitious Malay female students would attempt to ward off the creature by donning sweaty clothing \\"to give the appearance of someone who had just been with a man\\". Some versions of the legend hold that the Orang Minyak is an evil human warlock rather than a supernatural creature. Science writer Benjamin Radford described the tales as \\"rooted in myth and folklore\\" and characterized the creature's supposed abilities as \\"implausible\\". According to Radford, \\"if a person actually covered himself that way, greasy hands and feet would make it difficult to turn doorknobs or run around, not to mention crawl up the sides of buildings or grab a struggling captive\\". In one version of the legend, popularised in the 1958film Sumpah Orang Minyak (The Curse of the Oily Man) directed by and starring P. Ramlee, the Orang Minyak was a man who was cursed in an attempt to win back his love with magic. According to the story, the devil offered to help the creature and give him powers of the black arts, but only if the Orang Minyak worshipped him and raped 21 virgins within a week. In another version, the creature is under control of an evil shaman or witch doctor. Malaysian newspapers occasionally report claimed sightings of the Orang Minyak. In 2012, the residents in Kampung (Village) Laksamana, in Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia, claimed to have seen and heard the creature in the vicinity of the Pangsapuri Laksamana and Jalan Laksamana. Several years earlier, local newspapers carried sensational reports of a knife-wielding rapist covered in oil, ostensibly in imitation of the Orang Minyak.

It recounts the life of Lord Shigeru from the age of 12 (the year in which Takeo is born). It begins with the murder of Kikuta Isamu, Takeo's father, and includes Shigeru's training with Matsuda Shingen, the battle of Yaegahara, the role of Muto Shizuka, the meeting with Lady Maruyama, and other events foreshadowing Across the Nightingale Floor. It concludes with Shigeru and Takeo's meeting which begins the series. Synopsis The following divisions are not so marked in the novel, but are included below to separate the logical sections of the plot. =Introduction= Kikuta Isamu has embraced the religion of The Hidden, and made a new life in Mino, a secret village. He is tracked down by his cousin Kotaro, who tells him he is sentenced to death for leaving The Tribe. Isamu leads him on a chase, but when finally cornered, refuses to defend himself. Kotaro kills him, but is later haunted by Isamu's words of forgiveness, and wonders if the man had left a child. 12 year old Shigeru visits his mother's house in Hagi when Endo Akira runs up, saying that Shigeru's brother Takeshi and Mori Yuta had fallen in the river and not resurfaced. Shigeru dives in with an unknown girl (later revealed as Akane), and they manage to save Takeshi, but Yuta is dead. After the funeral, Yuta's father offers to kill himself in exchange. Shigeru's step-uncles believe the whole family should be put to death, and their property confiscated. Shigemori, who is Lord Otori and Shigeru's father, agrees with Shigeru that the proposed punishment is excessive, and the sons enter their service instead. From this day, Shigeru mistrusts his uncles. =Shigeru's Training= When aged 15, he and his best friend are caught sleeping with a maid, and he is warned by his father of the dangers of illegitimate children vying for inheritance. Indeed, over 30 years ago, Shigemori fell into the same trap with a woman from the Tribe, and ever since he has feared his child's reappearance. He sends Shigeru to Matsuda Shingen, former warrior and now priest at Terayama, for instruction. On the way, events lead Shigeru to suspect Lord Noguchi, an Otori ally, of treachery. War with the Tohan seems inevitable. He arrives at Terayama, and there is treated the same as any other novice. He is on the point of leaving in frustration when Matsuda takes him into the wilderness for training of the mind, and later, of the body. A houou bird visits and leaves a feather, an omen of peace, though the stain of blood suggests that Shigeru's death will be in the cause of justice. Later, in a training fight, Shigeru knocks Matsuda unconscious, and runs for help. He encounters a member of the Tribe, known as The Fox, who can make himself invisible, and who gives him some herbs that speed Matsuda's recovery. When Matsuda wakes he warns Shigeru that, from the Tribe, the herbs could just as easily been poison. One evening, they are approached by two men on horseback. They are looking for Matsuda, and one challenges him to a fight, to prove he is the better swordsman and for insulting the Tohan Lord by not coming to Inuyama to tutor his son. Matsuda replies that Shigeru is his better, and so the man should fight Shigeru. Shigeru kills the man easily‚Äîhis first kill‚Äîand sends the other man back to report on what happened. They return to Terayama to discover the old Abbot in dead: Matsuda is installed as his successor. Autumn passes, before Winter closes in. =Coming of Age= The stone bridge at Hagi is completed, and to appease the spirits, the stonemason is sealed inside. His daughter, Akane, is a courtesan at Haruna's establishment, and is consoled by her favourite client, Hayato. He wishes to marry her, but Shigeru provides money for her and her family, and overtures are made for her to be his concubine. She turns Hayato away, but Shigeru travels with his men to the border with the Tohan. There he finds people belonging to a sect known as The Hidden. Tohan warriors have been entering Otori land, and submitting the members of the sect to torture. Shigeru learns from a survivor and his family the beliefs of the Hidden. They come across some Tohan with their Lord, Iida Sadamu, trapped in a cave. They rescue him, in return for a promise to honour the borders. They believe, however, it will be a promise not honoured. On his return he received reprobation from his father and uncles. Akane becomes his concubine, and he builds a special house for her to live in. His mother soon moves into the palace and organises a wedding for him to Yanagi Moe. In jealousy, Akane obtains a charm which makes Moe shrink in terror when Shigeru attempts to consummate the marriage. Hayato pleads with Akane to come away with him, but she refuses. By the next day, he had cursed the Otori in Shigeru's uncle's hearing, and was killed. With his entire family under a death sentence, Akane pleads for mercy on their behalf: in return, she agrees to report on Shigeru's actions, though she hopes not to betray her lover. =Alliances= Shigeru grants the Hidden man, Nesutoro, permission to join fellow believers in the west, while Takeshi tells him that people fear their father's indecisiveness. Shigeru entrusts patrolling of the eastern border to the Noguchi and Kitano, while he prepares to meet secretly with Seishuu Lords to discuss alliances. Masahiro comes to Akane again for more news, and she tells him that Shigeru plans to meet someone from the Arai or Maruyama. Shigeru sets off, dropping his wife at her father's house on the way. In Yamagata he is met by Muto Shizuka of the Tribe. Under the pretense of a day's hawking, she leads them out to meet Arai Daiichi, her lover. Despite a friendly meeting, he was unable to garner open support from the Arai. Later, in her role as member of the Tribe, Shizuka delivers a letter from Iida to the Noguchi which will almost ensure the Otori defeat. Shigeru journeys to Terayama, where Takeshi is to be trained, and also to be out of harms way if war breaks out. There he meets Maruyama Naomi, leader of a clan inherited through the female line, and they between them agree to an alliance. She also reveals that The Hidden in her domain are under her protection. Shigeru returns to Hagi and convinces Shigemori, with his mother's help, to send his untrustworthy uncles away, however the uncles procrastinate until winter prevents the journey. By the time Spring comes, however, his uncles are only too happy to depart to their estates, having told Akane it won't be for long. Shigemori impresses on Shigeru the imperative to live on if, in the impending battle, the ancestral sword Jato comes to him. =The Battle of Yaegahara= The Otori army of 5000 men left Hagi, Shigeru receiving an emotional farewell from Akane, and a cold one from his wife. They met the Tohan army, who had already razed Chigawa, at the plain of Yaegahara. They are betrayed by their own forces: the Kitano who failed to attack the Tohan as they passed, and the Noguchi who openly attack the Otori, killing Shigeru's friend Kiyoshige and taking his head. Hemmed in on two sides, the Otori suffer heavy losses, including his father Shigemori. Defeated, Shigeru retreats to a stream where he prepares to take his own life. However The Fox (Kenji), the member of the Tribe he met some years ago, finds him and brings him Jato, retrieved from near his father's body. Thus determined to escape, he follows Kenji through the wilderness to a secret village of the tribe, where he recuperates. Shigeru gradually trusts him, despite Kenji's associations, and realises that to survive, he would need to be devious, and patient. Shigeru's uncles return to Hagi and were installed as interim regents, and requested Lord Kitano, who was the most neutral of the Lords, to act as an intermediary between them and Iida Sadamu. Masahiro comes to Akane, tells her that Shigeru was dead or captured, and rapes her. In despair for her loss and her part in it, she kills the priest who gave her the charm, and casts herself into the mouth of a volcano. Shigeru rides to the castle with a great procession behind him. His wife, bitter at the death of her family in battle, tells him of Akane's fate. With most of his friends and advisors dead, he battled to keep a calm demeanour as he met with his uncles and other senior advisors. Kitano arrives the next day to negotiate terms: Shigeru's abdication and retirement, the ceding of territory, and later, the taking of hostages from the Seishuu to ensure their loyalty. =The Farmer= Shigeru and his wife begin a distorted sexual relationship, she deliberately inciting his anger, and then submitting to it. She conceives, after which they rarely speak. He seeks permission to retrieve Takeshi from Terayama, and after receiving evasive replies, he travels anonymously through the mountains. The brothers honour their father's death there during the festival, and Shigeru plans to take on the persona of a harmless Farmer, giving him time to patiently wait for his revenge. After they return, Moe, Shigeru's wife, dies with her baby during childbirth, which sends him into depression. Shizuka, now a mother, hears that Kikuta Kotaro killed Lady Maruyama's child, which marks the turning point in her loyalty. Shigeru starts compiling records on the tribe, and later Shizuka comes to him as an informer, secretly assisting him. Across the 3 countries, Shigeru's Farmer persona has been accepted, though some look to him for salvation, or at least to act like a Lord. After Takeshi becomes rebellious, he is taken into Miyoshi Satoru's household for training. Shigeru receives a mysterious note from Lady Maruyama. After an assassination attempt on his life is foiled, he meets her at a remote shrine, and they begin a secretive relationship. They meet only occasionally, and when a lone Yanagi warrior attempts to kill Iida Sadamu, it becomes too dangerous to even write. They spend six years apart, during which time Lady Maruyama's daughter Mariko is taken hostage in Iida's castle, and Shirakawa Kaede likewise resides at Noguchi. =Conclusion= At Noguchi castle, Arai Daiichi is becoming impatient, and Naomi fears that anything rash may endanger her and Mariko. She travels with Shizuka to Yamagata, and the two women confide their fears and plans to each other. Naomi continues on alone to Terayama, where she has an unexpected meeting with Shigeru. Afterwards she goes to Inuyama to visit her daughter, but cannot stay, as she has conceived a child to Shigeru. Knowing that bearing his son would be disaster for them all, she sends word to Shizuka, and she rushes back to Maruyama. Shizuka comes and gives Naomi a herbal concoction which terminates the pregnancy. She is comforted by Sachie and her sister Eriko, who are both members of The Hidden, and she becomes one of them. Word comes from a travelling peddler, a member of The Hidden, who met a boy in Mino, who looks like an Otori. Shizuka sets off at once for Hagi and brings Shigeru the news, who resolves to rescue him from likely persecution from Iida's men, with the knowledge that if the boy inherited his family's skills, he may be the assassin he has been waiting for. Before he can go, his mother dies of a fever; Shigeru also suffers from it, but slowly recovers. In the meantime, Takeshi is killed in a fight in Yamagata and is later buried at Terayama. Iida rewards his killers. Shigeru makes the long journey cross-country to Mino, where he is just in time to rescue the boy, Tomasu, from Iida's men who had already destroyed Tomasu's village. He renames him Takeo, and plans to adopt him, and together they would destroy Iida Sadamu.

They are found traditionally in coastal Karnataka and engaged in toddy tapping, cultivation and other activities. They have used both missionary education and Sri Narayana Guru's reform movement to upgrade themselves.  Etymology and origins  L. K. Ananthakrishna Iyer recounted the community's belief that billava means bowmen and that it \\"applied to the castemen who were largely employed as soldiers by the native rulers of the district\\". Edgar Thurston had reached a similar conclusion in 1909. The Billavas are first recorded in inscriptions dating from the fifteenth century AD but Amitav Ghosh notes that \\"... this is merely an indication of their lack of social power; there is every reason to suppose that all the major Tuluva castes share an equally long history of settlement in the region\\". The earliest epigraphy for the Tuluva Bunt community dates to around 400 years earlier.  Language  Linguistic map of the Madras Presidency, ca. 1913. There is a complex linguistic environment in Tulu Nadu, which is the area of India to which the Billavas trace their origin. A compact geographic area, Tulu Nadu lies on the coastal belt of Karnataka and Kerala and has natural boundaries in the form of the Arabian Sea, the hills of the Western Ghats and the rivers Suvarna and Chandragiri. It includes the South Canara district of Karnataka and the Kasaragod area of Kerala, which were formerly united for administrative purposes within the Madras Presidency. Although many languages and dialects are traditionally to be found there‚Äîfor example, Tulu, Kannada, Konkani and Marathi‚Äîit is the first two of these that are common throughout, and of those two it is Tulu that gave rise to the region's name. Traditionally, Kannada is used in formal situations such as education, while Tulu is the lingua franca used in everyday communication. Tulu is more accepted as the primary language in the north of the Tulu Nadu region, with the areas south of the Netravati river demonstrating a more traditional, although gradually diminishing, distinction between that language and the situations in which Kannada is to be preferred. A form of the Tulu language known as Common Tulu has been identified, and this is spreading as an accepted standard for formal communication. Although four versions of it exist, based on geographic demarcations and also the concentration of various caste groups within those areas, that version which is more precisely known as Northern Common Tulu is superseding the other three dialects. the Brahmin community use Common Tulu only to speak with those outside their own caste, while communities such as the Bunts, Billavas and Gouds use it frequently, and the tribal communities are increasingly abandoning their own dialects in favour of it. William Logan's work Manual of Malabar, a publication of the British Raj period, recognised the Billavas as being the largest single community in South Canara, representing nearly 20 per cent of that district's population.  Marriage, death and inheritance  The Billavas practised the matrilineal system of inheritance known as Aliya Kattu or Aliya Santana. Ghosh describes that this system entailed that \\"men transmit their immovable property, not to their own children, but matrilineally, to their sister's children.\\" Iyer described the rules regarding marriage as Marriage of widows was permitted but the wedding ritual in such cases was simplified. An amended version of the ceremony was also used for situations where an illegitimate child might otherwise result: the father had to marry the pregnant woman in such circumstances. Women were considered to be ritually polluted at the time of their first menstrual cycle and also during the period of pregnancy and childbirth. The Billava dead are usually cremated, although burial occurs in some places, and there is a ritual pollution period observed at this time also. The Billava community is one of a few in India that practice posthumous marriage. Others that do so include the Badagas, Komatis and the Todas.  Subgroups  All of the Tuluva castes who participate fully in Bhuta worship also have loose family groupings known as balis. These groups are also referred to as \\"septs\\", and are similar to the Brahmin gotras except that their membership is based on matrilineal rather than patrilineal descent. Iyer noted 16 balis within the Billava community and that some of these had further subdivisions. Thurston said of these exogamous Billava groups that \\"There is a popular belief that these are sub-divisions of the twenty balis which ought to exist according to the Aliya Santana system (inheritance of the female line).\\"  Worship of Bhutas  A Paravar devil- dancer, ca. 1909. The Billavas were among the many communities to be excluded from the Hindu temples of Brahmins and they traditionally worship spirits in a practice known as Bhuta Kola. S. D. L. Alagodi wrote in 2006 of the South Canara population that \\"Among the Hindus, a little over ten per cent are Brahmins, and all the others, though nominally Hindus, are really propitiators or worshippers of tutelary deities and bhutas or demons.\\" The venues for Bhuta Kola are temple structures called Bhutasthana or Garidi as well as numerous shrines. The officiators at worship are a subcaste of Billavas, known as Poojary (priest), and their practices are known as pooja. Iyer noted that families often have a place set aside in their home for the worship of a particular Bhuta and that the worship in this situation is called Bhuta Nema. Iyer, who considered the most prevalent of the Billava Bhutas to be the twin heroes Koti and Chennayya, also described the spirits as being of people who when living had More recently, Ghosh has described a distinction between the Bhuta of southern India, as worshipped by the Billavas, and the similarly named demons of the north Bhuta Kola is a cult practised by a large section of Tulu Nadu society, ranging from landlords to the Dalits, and the various hierarchical strands all have their place within it. While those at the top of this hierarchical range provide patronage, others such as the Billava provide the practical services of officiating and tending the shrines, while those at the bottom of the hierarchy enact the rituals, which include aspects akin to the regional theatrical art forms known as Kathakali and Yakshagana. For example, the pooja rituals include devil-dancing, performed by the lower class Paravar or Naike, and the Bunts ‚Äì who were historically ranked as superior to the Billava‚Äì rely upon the Poojary to officiate. There was a significance in the Bunt landholdings and the practice of Bhuta worship. As the major owners of land, the Bunts held geographic hubs around which their tenant farmers and other agricultural workers were dispersed. The Billavas, being among the dispersed people, were bonded to their landlords by the necessities of livelihood and were spread so that they were unable to unite in order to assert authority. Furthermore, the Bhuta belief system also provided remedies for social and legal issues: it provided a framework for day-to-day living. Thurston noted that Baidya was a common name among the community, as was Poojary. He was told that this was a corruption of Vaidya, meaning a physician.  Traditional occupations  A Billava toddy tapper, ca. 1909 Heidrun Br√ºckner describes the Billavas of the nineteenth century as \\"frequently small tenant farmers and agricultural labourers working for Bunt landowners.\\" Writing in 1930, Iyer described the community as being involved mostly in toddy tapping, although they also had involvements in agriculture and in some areas were so in the form of peasant tenant landholders known as raiyats. This was echoed in a report of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research of 1961, which said that \\"The Billavas are concentrated mostly in South Kanara district. Though toddy tappers by profession, they rely mostly on cultivation. They are generally small landowners or lessees ...\\" According to Ghosh, \\"By tradition, [the Billavas] are also associated with the martial arts and the single most famous pair of Tuluva heroes, the brothers Koti-Chennaya, are archetypal heroes of the caste who symbolize the often hostile competition between the Billavas and the Bunts.\\" Neither Thurston nor Iyer make any reference to this claim.  Culture  Tuluva paddanas are sung narratives which are part of several closely related singing traditions, similar to Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern ballads) of northern Kerala and which may be considered ballads, epics or ritual songs (depending on the context or purpose for which they are sung). The community has special occasions in which it is traditional to sing paddanas. They will sing the Paddana of Koti-Chennaya during a ceremony on the eve of a marriage. Women who sing the song in the fields will sing those verses appropriate for the young heroes.Peter J. Claus, \\"Variability in the Tulu Paddanas\\". Retrieved 9 March 2011.  Social changes  The Billava community suffered ritual discrimination under the Brahmanic system‚Äîof which the caste system in Kerala was perhaps the most extreme example until the twentieth century. They were, however, allowed to live in the same villages as Brahmins. Some Billavas had seen the possibility of using religion as a vehicle for the social advancement of their community, as the Paravars had previously attempted in their conversion to Christianity. The British had wrested the region from the control of Tipu Sultan in 1799, as a consequence of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, and in 1834 the Christian Basel Mission arrived in Mangalore. These evangelists were among the first to take advantage of a relaxation of rules that had prevented non-British missionaries from working in India, and theirs was the first Protestant mission of any nationality in the area. They initially condemned the caste system because it was an inherent part of the Hindu religion and therefore must be wrong, but they came to see the divisions caused by it as being evil in their own right and took to undermining it as a matter of social justice. They considered the stratification of the caste system as being contrary to Christian values, which proclaimed that all were equal in the eyes of God. These missionaries had some success in converting native people, of which those converted from among the Billavas formed the \\"first and largest group\\". Br√ºckner describes the Billavas as being \\"the strongest group among the converts\\" and that, along with the Bunts, they were \\"the mainstays of the popular local religion, and the mission was probably induced by this target group to occupy itself with its practices and oral literature.\\" Alagodi notes that the However, the conversion of Billavas to Christianity did not always run smoothly. The Basel missionaries were more concerned with the quality of those converted than with the quantity. In 1869 they rejected a proposition that 5000 Billavas would convert if the missionaries would grant certain favours, including recognition of the converts as a separate community within the church and also a dispensation to continue certain of their traditional practices. The missionaries took the view that the proposition was contrary to their belief in equality and that it represented both an incomplete rejection of the caste system and of Hindu practices. Alagodi has speculated that if the proposition had been accepted then \\"Protestant Christians would have been perhaps one of the largest religious communities in and around Mangalore today.\\" A further barrier to conversion proved to be the Billava's toddy tapping occupation: the Basel Mission held no truck with alcohol, and those who did convert found themselves economically disadvantaged, often lacking both a job and a home. This could apply even if they were not toddy tappers: as tenant farmers or otherwise involved in agriculture, they would lose their homes and the potential beneficence of their landlords if they converted. The Mission attempted to alleviate this situation by provision of work, principally in factories that produced tiles and woven goods. Nireshvalya Arasappa‚Äîdescribed by Kenneth Jones as \\"one of the few educated Billavas\\"‚Äîwas one such person who looked to conversion from Hinduism as a means to advancement during the nineteenth century. Having initially examined the opportunities provided by Christian conversion, Arasappa became involved with the Brahmo Samaj movement in the 1870s and he arranged for Brahmo missionaries to meet with his community. The attempt met with little success: the Billavas were suspicious of the Brahmo representatives, who wore western clothing and spoke in English whereas the Basel Missionaries had studied the local languages and produced a copy of the New Testament in both Tulu and Kannada. = Kudroli Gokarnanatheshwara Temple = Gokarnanatheshwara Temple Ezhavas, a kindred community from Kerala, were organised by Narayana Guru in establishing social equality through his temple in Sivagiri. Using the same principles, Billavas established a temple. After the construction of the Kudroli Gokarnanatheshwara Temple at Mangalore, Naryana Guru asked community leaders to work together for mutual progress by organising schools and industrial establishments; in accordance with his wishes, many Sree Narayana organisations have sprung up in the community.

The game can be considered a descendant of dice- and-charts baseball simulations such as Strat-o-Matic baseball and Pursue the Pennant. In fact, in the beginning, the game was called \\"Pursue The Pennant\\" because Tippett had a marketing relationship with the company of the same name. This relationship ended in 1995, when the game and company were officially given its current name. Pursue The Pennant itself had been revived in 1993 as a board version, windows version and new online version game called Dynasty League Baseball. Diamond Mind differs from Strat-o-Matic and other games of the genre in that it is not derived from a board game; it is strictly a computer game. Tippett claims that the fact that the game is designed \\"from the ground up\\" to take advantage of the versatility and speed of the PC make it a more accurate and flexible game than its competitors, such as Strat-o- Matic. Strat-o-Matic supporters, including Strat-o-Matic founder Hal Richman, have responded to this by stating that since Diamond Mind does not reveal its source code or algorithms, there is no way to independently verify or refute its claims of superior statistical accuracy. Diamond Mind was named PC Magazine Editor's Choice for PC-based baseball games in its June 28, 2005 issue. It is also often used by sporting publications to predict the outcome of upcoming seasons. Diamond Mind relocated from Boston to Beaverton, Oregon in 2005. On August 14, 2006, Diamond Mind became a wholly owned subsidiary of Simnasium (now Imagine Sports), a company which has its headquarters in Silicon Valley. Tippett stepped down from his position as head of the company to take a position with the Boston Red Sox, ceding control to Simnasium CEO Dayne Myers. Tippett remains with the company as a consultant. Over the next two years, Simnasium/Imagine Sports shifted the development of Diamond Mind away from the PC and into the on-line world. On May 24, 2008, Imagine Sports announced to their customers that there will be no new versions of the PC version of Diamond Mind for the foreseeable future so that the company might focus on the on-line version of the game. However, later in 2008, this policy changed as Diamond Mind announced a tenth version of their standalone PC game would be released in February 2009. After numerous production delays, the tenth edition of the game was finally released in June 2010. Simnasium/Imagine has continued to provide nominal patches, and also launched Version 11 in 2015, which added player photos and expanded play by play, amongst other features.

He studied painting at the \\"Scuola Libera del Nudo\\" of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Naples and obtained Laurea in Geological Science, from the University of the same city.\\"Laurea is the Italian tertiary degree, between BSc and MSc. He gained a post-graduate diploma in Computer Science from the Institute of Informatics of EL.KE.PA. (Hellenic Centre for the Enhancement of Productivity), Athens. He also completed free studies in Sumi-e and traditional Chinese painting, engraving, artistic book-binding and Graphics Design (this last at the Athens Technological Education Institute).

He is regarded as a club legend by Grimsby Town who signed him at the age of 35 when he was apparently past his best. He went on to be described as one of the club's greatest ever players.http://www.grimsby- townfc.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/r.i.p.-paul-futcher-3433627.aspx Prior to his time with Grimsby he had enjoyed lengthy spells with Luton Town, Oldham Athletic and Barnsley as well as playing for Chester, Manchester City, Derby County and Halifax Town. After leaving Grimsby in 1994 he played for Dundalk before moving into management. Playing career Futcher was the defensive half of twin brothers. His brother was centre-forward Ron. Futcher began his career with hometown club Chester, who he made his debut for as a 16-year-old against Cambridge United in March 1973. This came just a fortnight after his older brother Graham had played his final game for the club and seven months before Ron made his debut for the Blues. Futcher quickly turned professional and had made 20 Football League appearances when Luton Town snapped him up for ¬£100,000 in the summer of 1974. Ron joined him on the journey south, where Paul was to play more than 140 games and won ten England under 21 caps. Futcher was the most expensive defender in England when he became Manchester City's record signing for ¬£350,000 on 1 June 1978.Paul Futcher at Sporting- Heroes.net He replaced club stalwart Tommy Booth in the side which failed to live up to expectations and as the major new signing he attracted criticism. Booth won his place back and on 1 July 1979 he left Maine Road for a fee of ¬£150,000 and joined Second Division Oldham Athletic. Futcher had twice been chosen for the England squad and each time a road accident had put paid to him fulfilling the invitation.Official Grimsby Town site Paul Futcher profile Futcher was signed by Grimsby Town from Halifax Town reserves, aged 34, by Alan Buckley for ¬£10,000 as a short term replacement for Andy Tillson. He went on to be a fans' favourite for five seasons, winning the Supporters Player of the Year twice in that time. Then his son Ben Futcher joined the club for their League Two play-off final season of 2005‚Äì06 before he left for Peterborough United. During his time at Grimsby, Futcher was held in high esteem by the club's supporters. Following the arrival of Brian Laws as manager and a poor performance in a match against Oldham Athletic, he departed in 1994, but remains thought of as one of the club's best-ever players. He later played for Dundalk where he played in UEFA Cup Qualifying Round against Malmo. Management and coaching =Gresley Rovers= Futcher led Rovers to the Dr. Martens Premier Division championship in 1997; they were not promoted to the Conference because their ground failed to meet Conference standards. During this time, they regularly played against now-EFL club Burton Albion, often beating them handily. =Southport= The highlight of his two-and-a- half year stint with Southport was the club's FA Trophy final outing in 1998, where at 41; Futcher became the oldest player to appear in a competitive Wembley final. The Sandgrounders narrowly lost to Cheltenham Town, and the remainder of the former Manchester City man's Haig Avenue tenure was blemished by successful relegation scraps. =Ashton United= Futcher was unable to save the Robins from relegation to the Northern Premier League. He subsequently failed to motivate the squad (using nearly 50 players in 10 months) and left in December 2005. Personal life and death Futcher's twin brother Ron played in the Football League as well as being a top scorer in the North American Soccer League; and their older brother Graham also played professionally at Chester City. Paul's son Ben has extensive Football League experience and he is the cousin of Danny Murphy. On 23 November 2016 Futcher died of cancer. Former club Grimsby Town described him as \\"one of the greatest footballers ever to have graced Blundell Park\\", adding that \\"It is impossible to describe the complete admiration we had for him, or the feeling inside as his wonderful abilities dominated matches. He was a complete one-off. Even though you had watched him come away with the ball in the most desperate of circumstances, you could never quite work out how he had done it!

They play at the Paisley Park Soccer Complex in Altona North. History They were founded in 1979 by local Greek Australians under the name East Altona PAOK Soccer Club, taking their nickname and black and white stripes from the famous Greek club of the same name. The PAOK name was changed to Altona East Phoenix Soccer Club in the 1990s in accordance with Australian soccer authorities racist policy at mainstreaming soccer in Australia by forcing all teams to remove non-Anglo references in names. They spent most of their history up until 1992 in the amateur and provisional leagues, before steadily progressing up the league system and forming a close tight-knit squad that provided the results to eventually reach the Victorian Premier League (VPL) in 1999. After a hard-fought first inaugural season Altona East stayed up, which were followed by fantastic seasons in 2000 (3rd), 2001 (Semi-Finals) and 2002 (Elimination Finals). The club's reign as a title contender would end in 2003 as the club saw three different coaches unsuccessfully pull Phoenix out of relegation. Following the club's first ever relegation, Altona East maintained a solid mid-table finish in the 2004 State League 1 Division. The 2005 season saw a hard-fought campaign to push back into the VPL, finishing third, just outside a promotion place. 2006 saw another woeful season and Phoenix were relegated back into Division 2. The 2007 season saw a new batch of youngsters as well as some key experienced players, guided under new coach and ex-VPL referee Dominic Barba, as Altona East attempted to begin a new and improved squad. After an opening day 4‚Äì0 victory, PAOK saw itself with one victory in its first 9 games. However, the team recruited well mid-season and finished the season off positively, smashing rivals Altona City and Williamstown 6‚Äì1 and 7‚Äì1 respectively along the way. The 2008 season saw the club with the determination of promotion back to State League 1, containing a large and very strong squad. Being in the top two positions for most of the season, the Phoenix dropped crucial points and their fate was ultimately realised with a 2‚Äì1 away loss to eventual premiers Pascoe Vale, with the club finishing in 4th. However tragedy struck Paisley Park a day after the team's 2‚Äì1 home win against Cairnlea, with the news that then-current striker Nazir Ismail had died due to a car accident in the night. Nazir also scored in the match the day before, having a tally of 4 goals in his 7-game stint with the club. Altona East began the 2009 season with a weaker list than the previous year, but started brightly winning 5 games out of their first 6. However, after a run of mixed results, coach Dominic Barba was dismissed and within the week the experienced Zoran Trajcevski was appointed to salvage the season. The team continued its mixed results, finishing 4th for the second year in succession, despite beating champions North Geelong on the last match day. The following three seasons saw successive 6th-placed finishes, followed by an 8th-placed finish in 2013. Following the implementation of the National Premier Leagues Victoria, PAOK were \\"promoted\\" to State League 1 North-West, essentially the same tier they had competed in the year prior as the Victorian Premier League had been split into two divisions. In 2014, the Phoenix finished in 11th place. The following season was better for the club as they finished in 7th place. In 2017 Altona East finished in bottom place in the State League 1 North-West competition, enduring relegation to State 2 North-West for 2018, where they would finish in 8th place.  Colours  Altona East adopt the Black and White stripes of Greek side PAOK FC for their home kit.

His father, Catamantaloedes, had previously been the ruler of the tribe and had been recognized as a \\"friend\\" by the Roman Senate.  Social position  According to Julius Caesar, Casticus was a Sequanian whose father Catamantaloedes had been king for many years. It is believed that he was chosen by Orgetorix to join his conspiracy because he was one of the \\"two most prominent chieftains within his reach.\\"  Conspiracy  In 60 B.C. he entered into a conspiracy with Orgetorix of the Helvetii and Dumnorix of the Aedui. Each individual gave a pledge and swore an oath to one another in the hope that when they seized the sovereignty that they would be the three most powerful and valiant nations. This plan however fell apart when the conspiracy was made known to the Helvetii by an informer. Some historians have found links between the Conspiracy of Orgetorix the Helvetian, Dumnorix the Aeduan, and Casticus as an allusion to the First Triumvirate. William Henry Altman expands on Yves Gerhard's views of this by presenting six parallels between what he calls \\"The Gallic Triumvirate\\" and the First Triumvirate. = Parallels between \\"The Gallic Triumvirate\\" and the First Triumvirate = # Secret character of alliance # Chronological simultaneity of two triads # Common goal of two conspiracies # Use of marriage for political goal # Common appeal to people against aristocracy # Eventual defeat of coalitions  Death  The cause of Casticus‚Äô death is not detailed in the accounts given by Caesar. However, according to Rene Van Royen, it can be inferred that Casticus was either put to death swiftly upon the discovery of the conspiracy by the Helvetii or that he faced a fate similar to the one that Orgetorix faced (burning) when he was brought forward for trial by the Helvetii. Since the account of his death is missing, it is not known exactly what fate awaited Casticus. All that is known thus far is inferred from what is known of the people and the times.  Literature and drama  Despite not much being known about the Conspiracy of Orgetorix, there have been two dramas written that detail the account of what is believed to have happened. In each of these accounts Casticus makes an appearance and plays a very brief part in the drama. = The Conspiracy of Orgetorix, A Dramatization = This play details Orgetorix as he begins planning and persuading others to join in his conspiracy. The drama was designed for there to not be any costumes worn except for swords, shields, and spears for the soldiers. This is largely due to the fact that this play was written in as a project for the author's Latin class to perform. Casticus does not appear until Act III of the play. In this act Orgetorix persuades Dumnorix and Casticus to join the conspiracy in the hopes of gaining control of Gaul. The final act of the play is the trial of Orgetorix after the conspiracy has been revealed. = Dumnorix, A Play Fabula Braccata = This play also details the accounts of what takes place during the formation of the conspiracy. Similar to The Conspiracy of Orgetorix, A Dramatization, it is also written in Latin.

Originally marketed for various competitions as the US101, it was developed and manufactured in the US by a consortium headed by Lockheed Martin, consisting of Lockheed Martin Systems Integration ‚Äì Owego (LMSI), AgustaWestland and Bell Helicopter. In January 2005, the US101 was selected for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from the request for proposal (RFP) issued. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised that a lack of flexibility and compromise on the part of the government had negatively impacted the program. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely. In February 2009, President Barack Obama asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about placing the project on hold or canceling it because of its high cost: over $13 billion for the planned 28 helicopters. In June 2009, the U.S. Navy terminated the contract after spending about $4.4 billion and taking delivery of nine VH-71s. After the cancellation, the delivered helicopters were sold to Canada for $164 million, where they were used as source of spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search-and-rescue helicopters. Development =US101 and VXX competition= The AgustaWestland AW101, initially designated as EH101, was originally developed and produced by EH Industries, which was a joint venture between the British Westland Helicopters and Italian Agusta companies; Westland merged with Agusta to form AgustaWestland in 2001. AgustaWestland held considerable interest in the export prospects of the AW101, including the prospects for an extensive overseas manufacturing consortium. On 23 July 2002, Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland announced that they had signed a 10-year agreement to jointly market, manufacture and support a medium-lift helicopter, an AW101 derivative, in the United States. At that time, the team declared that the derivative, which was designated as the US101, would be \\"65% American\\". The companies envisaged the aircraft being adopted in three major roles; U.S. Air Force combat search and rescue, U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue, and U.S. Marine Corps executive transport.\\"Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland Announce Long- term Agreement for US101 Helicopter\\". Lockheed Martin, 23 July 2002.\\"AgustaWestland seals 10-year US101 deal with Lockheed Martin.\\" Flight International, 24 July 2002. In early 2002, the Lockheed-AgustaWestland partnership sought out other firms to participate in the proposed local manufacturing effort for the US101; in particular, the team pursued Bell Helicopters, which was at that time part of another EH101 consortium, offering the type in Canada.\\"Manufacturers seek US101 partner.\\" Flight International, 19 February 2002. That same year, Rolls-Royce Holdings, who manufactured the EH101's RTM322, also sought out an American partner to locally produce the engine; Rolls-Royce also envisioned integrating US-specific technology into the engine and its potential use in powering the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter.\\"Rolls-Royce considers US sourcing for helicopter engine.\\" Flight International, 24 July 2002.Lewis, Paul. \\"US Army weighs engine options.\\" Flight International, 20 August 2002.

In December 2007, DoD officials met with the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; the Pentagon had apparently wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled a decision to cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while options were considered.\\"VH-71 Presidential Helicopter on Hold\\". Defense News, 14 December 2007. In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010.

It was reported not only that a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3 billion in sunk VH-71 costs.Gertler 2009, pp. 12, 14‚Äì15. Following the President's decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded it would be more cost-effective and less time-consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.Chavanne, Bettina H. \\"Objections to VH-71 Cancellation Grow Louder\\". Aviation Week's DTI, 5 June 2009. In 2009, the CRS proposed four options: Option 1 was to continue the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the additional cost was estimated at $10 billion and the entry into service date was 2019. Option 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4 billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this option was estimated at $5.6 billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last option was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet at a cost of $1.4 billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.Gertler 2009, pp 18‚Äì21. In addition to the cost of a new procurement program, industry officials stated that to merely extend the operating life of the current fleet is a risky choice because it is both less secure and costly to maintain.\\"Objections to VH-71 Cancellation Grow Louder\\" .

History Hoj≈çjutsu (ÊçïÁ∏ÑË°ì) or Nawajutsu, (Á∏ÑË°ì) is the traditional Japanese martial skill of restraining a person using cord or rope (Hoj≈ç). It found use on both on and off the battlefield in up to 125 individual martial arts schools. It was used in particular by the various police-forces of the Edo- period and remains in use to this day with the Tokyo police force. In the warring-era (1467‚Äì1615) it was not uncommon for warriors carrying a rope for use as a tool or as a restraint for prisoners of war when on campaign. The rope is to be used on an opponent after he or she has been subdued using restraining methods (torite) such as the methods found in the Ikkaku-ry≈´ juttejutsu system. Ittatsu-ry≈´ Hoj≈çjutsu was created in the 17th century by Matsuzaki Kin'ueimon Shigekatsu, the third shihanke of the Shint≈ç Mus≈ç-ry≈´, who also created the Ikkaku-ry≈´, and later transmitted through the \\"New Just\\" (Shint≈ç) Mus≈ç-ry≈´ tradition as its main rope-art.Matsui, Kenji. 1993. The History of Shindo Muso Ryu Jojutsu, translated by Hunter Armstrong (Kamuela,HI: International Hoplological Society) The rope used in Ittatsu-ry≈´ is about 5 meters in length and a diameter of about 3.5 mm. Although handcuffs have generally replaced the rope, there exists today a modern form of hojojutsu in the Tokyo policeforce. This system was derived mainly from the Ittatsu-ry≈´ tradition and were taught by the Shint≈ç Mus≈ç-ry≈´ Shihanke Shimizu Takaji in his formal duty as a police force instructor in the mid 20th century. Hoj≈ç methods In the strict social-system of the Tokugawa-era (1603‚Äì1868) there was a high emphasis on treating each individual according to what class the individual belonged to. Each of the Ittatsu-ryu form(kata)-series is adapted to deal with the social status of the individual being restrained. A samurai-lord, (if being arrested for a crime), would have to be restrained in a way that enables the individual to retain his or her dignity. Women, priests (of either shinto or Buddhist faith), samurai, and commoners (considered to be near bottom of the class-system) would have to be restrained in a way that represented their position in the class-hierarchy without disgracing them. Training The hoj≈ç-methods are for the most part taught only to advanced students who have achieved a high level of proficiency in the Shinto Muso-ryu Jodo forms, though the level required is not standardized and different Jodo-organisations have different requirements.

The model was renamed \\"Jazz\\" for most markets, with the name \\"Fit\\" being used in Japan, China, and the Americas.Fitta blev dyr aff√§r f√∂r Honda Similarly, sales of the Ford Pinto suffered in Brazil due to pinto being a Portuguese slang word for a penis; Mitsubishi found that the name of its Pajero model was the same as the Spanish term for \\"wanker\\"; and the name of the Toyota MR2, when spoken in French, bore an uncomfortable phonetic similarity to the French word merde, meaning \\"shit\\". * A name given by IKEA's Chinese website for its stuffed wolf toy Lufsig, Lo Mo Sai (Ë∑ØÂßÜË•ø), contained a homophone of Hai (Èñ™), a profane Cantonese word meaning \\"vagina\\"; the name itself could be written as Lo Mo Hai (ËÄÅÊØçÈñ™), meaning \\"mother's vagina\\".McBain, Sophie (10 December 2013). \\"How Lufsig the cuddly wolf became a Hong Kong protest symbol ‚Äì A short lesson in the art of mistranslating names into Chinese.\\" The New Statesman. * Ayds diet suppressant candy, which had existed for decades prior, continued to use this phonetically identical brand name through the 1980s, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic continued to grow. In 1985‚Äì1986, use of the name was in fact defended by executives of the company that manufactured it, as a boon to sales. Sales eventually plummeted, and the product name was changed in 1988‚Äì1989. * A German company courted controversy in 2010 when it introduced a brand of beer called Fucking Hell. The brand name was a deliberate choice which referred to the village of Fucking in Austria, combined with the German word Hell which refers to pale lager. The European Union Intellectual Property Office initially refused to grant a trademark for the beer on the grounds that it contained an English expletive, but relented on appeal. * In 2011, an internal leak of the Dell Latitude ST tablet (codenamed Peju) spread virally on the internet and received some attention in Indonesia, since \\"Peju\\" means sperm in Indonesian slang. * In 2012, a clothing store named \\"Hitler\\" opened in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. The store immediately became embroiled in an international controversy over its association with the German Nazi-era leader, Adolf Hitler. * Kiri cheese, produced by Bel Group, was rebranded as \\"Kibi\\" in Iran due to the derogatory meaning of \\"kiri\\" in Persian for male genitalia and rotten or rank. * Nokia's Lumia brand translates to prostitute in Spanish but is an uncommon word with gypsy roots. * Apple's Siri personal assistant pronunciation in Japan as \\"shiri\\" translates to buttocks, and in Indonesia, siri translates to \\"de facto (unregistered) marriage\\". * The World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view event Elimination Chamber carries a different name in Germany, \\"No Escape\\", in order to avoid associations with the Holocaust. * In 2019, Mushkegowuk Council Grand Chief told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that Heinz's latest 'Mayochup' product means \\"shit-face\\" in Cree. The incident went viral on Twitter.  Urban legends  Urban legends about brand blunders are popular, because they use familiar urban legend motifs such as the incompetent corporation or the ignorant foreigner. Often the reality is far less dramatic, and the stories, which are even retold in marketing textbooks, are rarely backed up by researched data about sales. *Electrolux: Swedish vacuum manufacturer Electrolux sold products successfully in the United Kingdom using a slogan produced by the English agency Cogent Elliot: \\"Nothing sucks like an Electrolux\\". Although many Americans think this is an example of a blunder, in fact the slang disparagement \\"sucks\\", originating in American English, was not current in British English at that time. *Pepsi: Pepsi allegedly introduced their slogan \\"Come alive with the Pepsi Generation\\" into the Chinese market. Translated into Chinese, it read \\"Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave\\". A similar claim has been made for the \\"Coke adds life\\" slogan, with the target market listed as anything from Taiwan to Thailand to Japan. *Coca- Cola: The name Coca-Cola rendered phonetically in Chinese can sound like the words for \\"bite the wax tadpole\\" () or \\"female horse stuffed with wax\\" (È™íÈ©¨Âè£Ë†ü). Before marketing in China, the company found a close phonetic equivalent, kekou kele (ÂèØÂè£ÂèØ‰πê), which roughly means \\"let your mouth rejoice\\". It was never marketed by the company using the other phrases, though individual merchants may have made such signs. *An urban legend holds that the Chevrolet Nova automobile sold poorly in Latin America, as \\"no va\\" means \\"doesn't go\\" in Spanish. In truth, the car sold well. The same has been said of the Vauxhall Nova, which had to be sold as an Opel Corsa in Spain. This too is a myth, as the car was built in Spain and known there as a Corsa from the outset. *Claims that the Buick LaCrosse name in translation becomes the equivalent of \\"to cross oneself\\", a Quebec French slang term for masturbation, are overstated. Buick initially used the nameplate Allure in Canada in an overabundance of caution when introducing the model in 2005, but abandoned this dual branding early in the 2010 model year. The vehicle now uses the LaCrosse branding in all countries. *Fake ads, often with sexually explicit content such as one for PUMA Puma's Problem The racy photo that's got a sneaker company steamedFake Puma Ad Mystery Solved and an even less plausible pedophilia-themed one for Breyers,The Ice Cream For Pedophiles ‚ÄòLickable‚Äô Breyers Ad have attracted attention and even official responses from the company denying affiliation.Sexually Explicit PUMA Ads Are Fake, Company Says  References   External links  * Marketing 101 and Mistranslations - urban legends about marketing blunders (real and false) from Snopes Category:Brand management Category:Translation ","title":"Brand blunder"},{"id":"4838974","text":"Acanthosomatidae is a family of Hemiptera, commonly named \\"shield bugs,\\" for which Kumar in his 1979 world revision recognized 47 genera; now this number is 55 genera, with about 200 species, and is one of the least diversified families within Pentatomoidea.Fa√∫ndez, E.

Raised in early 1942 from the remnants of a British unit that had been destroyed in Malaya, the squadron flew Bristol Beauforts from bases in Queensland and New Guinea, undertaking torpedo- and level-bombing sorties against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the squadron was disbanded in August 1946. History No. 100 Squadron was formed at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 15 February 1942; the following month Wing Commander John Balmer took command of the squadron. The squadron was formed from a nucleus of No. 100 Squadron RAF, which had been destroyed during the Malayan Campaign, and was named in that unit's honour. Despite this link, No. 100 Squadron RAAF was an Australian squadron throughout its existence and considered to be separate from its British namesake, which was re-formed as a heavy bomber squadron in Britain on 15 December 1942. The unit subsequently moved to Mareeba, Queensland, in May 1942, before conducting further training and anti-submarine patrols. Staging through Port Moresby, No. 100 Squadron flew its first combat missions in June 1942, making it the first of the RAAF's Beaufort bomber-equipped squadrons to see combat. During the mission seven aircraft bombed targets around Lae, losing one aircraft whilst sinking a Japanese merchant ship. Later a number of successful attacks were completed against Japanese positions. Following these attacks the squadron was withdrawn to Laverton in July, subsequently conducting patrols off New South Wales and Victoria and undertaking further training. A further move was later undertaken to Bohle River in Queensland. Meanwhile, after completing its training the squadron commenced deploying to Milne Bay in New Guinea in September 1942. No. 100 Squadron aircrew outside their headquarters hut on Goodenough Island in 1944 In October 1942, while participating in a training exercise off the coast of Townsville, Beaufort A9-26 of the No. 100 Squadron struck the mast of the wrecked SS City of Adelaide in Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island. The aircraft plunged into the shallow water below and the fuselage disintegrated on impact killing three RAAF officers and one US Navy officer aboard. On 6 October 1942 the Squadron conducted its first torpedo strike, with six Beauforts unsuccessfully targeting Japanese naval vessels. Over the following months the squadron conducted a number of dangerous low-level attacks with limited success, although a number of Japanese vessels were damaged or sunk. On 9 January 1943 a convoy returning from Lae was intercepted by six Beauforts off Gasmata. A Japanese cruiser was believed sunk in the action, for the loss of two aircraft. Flying from bases in eastern New Guinea No. 100 Squadron flew reconnaissance patrols and anti-shipping and bombing missions against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea mainland. Eight aircraft from the squadron participated in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, during which the squadron conducted a torpedo-bombing mission. It was not successful in sinking any ships in this battle, though, and from March 1943 it operated solely in the level bombing role. Later, in September 1943, the squadron flew anti- submarine patrols in support of amphibious landings around Lae. On 4 October, ten Beauforts made a low-level attack on the Japanese airfield at Gasmata, with three aircraft being shot down. A surfaced submarine was attacked and heavily damaged in St George's Channel on 18 October. The squadron bombed a bridge over the Anwek River in November as part of an air offensive over New Britain and the same month moved to Goodenough Island. The squadron remained at Goodenough Island until April 1944, when it relocated to Nadzab. This was followed by a further move to Tadji in July 1944. As a level bomber squadron, No. 100 Squadron conducted missions against Japanese facilities throughout New Guinea and surrounding islands during 1944, including the key base at Rabaul. In late 1944 and into 1945, it conducted operations in support of Allied ground operations. In October 1944, a detachment of five aircraft and crews from No. 100 Squadron being sent to reinforce No. 6 Squadron, which had been tasked to support Australian landings on New Britain. Prior to the landings, the Beauforts attacked targets across the Gazelle Peninsula, and then remained on standby to support the Landing at Jacquinot Bay. Later, further operations were flown around Wide Bay. The squadron's attention then turned to support of the 6th Division's campaign in Aitape‚ÄìWewak. The squadron continued in this role until the last day of the war, flying its final bombing mission the morning Japan surrendered, on 15 August 1945. Following the end of hostilities, No. 100 Squadron flew reconnaissance missions and leaflet drops before transferring to Finschafen in March 1946. There it undertook ferrying and courier flights until disbanding on 19 August 1946; prior to this, the squadron's strength had dwindled as personnel were repatriated back to Australia for demobilisation or transferred to other units for subsequent service with the occupation forces in Japan. Throughout the war a total of 115 aircrew fatalities were recorded among the squadron's personnel as a result of combat operations.

The synod is remarkable for a premature scheme of democratic church government and discipline, which failed for the time, but contained fruitful germs for the future and for other countries. It was suggested by the disputations which had been held at Z√ºrich for the introduction of the Zwinglian Reformation. Even before Luther's dramatic appearance, the lords of the State in Germany, no less than in France and England, had extended their prerogatives into the sphere of ecclesiastical affairs. The decision of the Diet of Speyer, August 27, 1526, which allowed every sovereign authority, pending the meeting of a council, to decide matters of faith for itself and its province, recognizing its accountability to God and the emperor, conceded, even though in limited terms, a canonical basis for the application of territorialism in favor of the Reformation. Landgrave Philip of Hesse had the sagacity to utilize the situation in a judicious manner and convened an assembly of spiritual and temporal estates at Homberg October 20, 1526, \\"to deal in the grace of the Almighty with Christian matters and disputes.\\" The proceedings were opened in the church at Homberg on Sunday, Oct. 21. To promote discussion, the former Franciscan Fran√ßois Lambert, of Avignon, had put forth 158 articles of debate (paradoxa), which had already been posted on the church doors. After the opening speech by the chancellor, Johann Feige, Lambert read his theses, and proceeded to substantiate them from Scripture and to enumerate the abuses of the Church. In the afternoon Adam Krafft, of Fulda, translated Lambert's theses into German, and challenged whoever found them at variance with God's Word to declare himself. Only the Franciscan prior Nicholas Ferber, of Marburg, came forward, and took the floor the following morning. He flatly contested the landgrave's authority to hold a synod, to undertake ecclesiastical changes, and to pass any measures in the affairs of the Christian faith; since this was altogether the privilege of the pope, the bishops, and the Church. When the chancellor urged the duty of the civil authorities to abolish abuses and idolatry Ferber still more sharply contested the assembly's competency to deal with an ecclesiastical question, and finally he attacked the prince's character for laying hands on the goods of the Church. He did not succeed, however, in giving another turn to the proceedings; nor did he attempt to refute the proffered articles of debate. He soon afterward left Hesse, and issued at Cologne Assertiones trecentat ac viginti adversus Fr. Lamberti paradoxa impia; and subsequently Assertiones ali≈ì. On the following day (Tuesday, October 23), when the synod was on the point of closing, there appeared unexpectedly Master Johann Sperber, of Waldau, near Kassel, who made a vain attempt to justify the invocation of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, by the angelic salutation in the first chapter of Luke.

The current route starts at Spanaway Loop Road in Spanaway and ends at the intersection of SR 7 and 176th Street. The highway is scheduled to be long, connecting SR 7 to Interstate 5 in the west. The project, largely unfunded, is estimated to cost $480 million.  Route description  The current highway begins at the intersection of 176th Street and Spanaway Loop Road, paralleling the border of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, south of SR 704, as a multiple lane highway. The current alignment parallels the former 176th Street, which has been turned into a cul-de-sac at the west end and truncated at the east before the intersection and terminus of the current alignment at SR 7.  History  = Environmental lawsuit = In July 2010, a coalition of local businesses, conservation organizations, and equestrian clubs filed a lawsuit against the Federal Highway Administration, WSDOT, and Pierce County to prevent construction of the proposed highway. Because the project has no funding and thus no construction schedule, the parties agreed to a stay of proceedings on October 15. The coalition contended that the agencies failed to follow the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and failed to adequately consider reasonable alternatives.Notice of Intent Letter, November 28, 2006 The coalition reports that the proposed highway would bisect the largest remnant oak woodland-prairie left in the Puget Sound area. The US Fish and Wildlife Service describes the area as \\"possibly the rarest habitat in North America,\\" home to at least 29 species of federal and/or state threatened, endangered, candidate, and sensitive plant and animal species of concern, 18 of which are in the immediate vicinity of the proposed highway. Drawing comparisons with Mt. Rainier National Park and Nisqually National Wildlife Area, Pierce County's Biodiversity Network Assessment describes the area as \\"the most biologically and ecologically rich area remaining in the lower elevations of Pierce County.\\" The County predicts that these diverse habitats support 20 state or federally listed species, 24 Priority Habitat and Species, and 10 at-risk species, and dozens of other plants and animals. The project's Environmental Impact Statement states, The EIS also states that \\"By 2025, most of the freeway and arterial street systems will operate at [Level of Service] F conditions with volume/capacity (V/C) ratios well above 1.0.\\" This means very heavy congestion and gridlock during most of the day.Cross- Base Highway SDEIS, Table 3.1-7 Furthermore, the proposed highway will increase climate impacts by increasing driving distance. The EIS states that \\"Overall, people would travel a little farther to use the new Cross-Base Highway project to avoid other congested highways and arterials; this would increase miles driven.\\"Cross-Base Highway FEIS, p. 4-201 A contrary view was expressed by Pierce County Executive John Ladenburg, who believes that it would be \\"environmentally irresponsible not to build that highway,\\" because SR 704 will lessen development in the Puyallup Valley farmlands.  Future  The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) plans to extend the highway to be long, originating at Interstate 5 in the Tillicum neighborhood of Lakewood, Washington. A four-lane, divided highway with four intersections over its entire length, SR 704 may improve access to and between the military installations by providing an exclusive roadway between Fort Lewis and McChord AFB. It could also connect the developing industrial areas of DuPont and Frederickson as well as provide an east‚Äìwest alternate thoroughfare to overcrowded State Route 512. When voters rejected a November 2007 ballot measure which would fund the construction, most of the project was put on hold. However, on June 20, 2008, the WSDOT awarded a $7.35 million contract to Ceccanti Inc. for widening of the eastern of the route between Spanaway Loop Road and State Route 7. Groundbreaking was July 30, 2008. Assistant Project Engineer John Ho says that the project was scheduled to be completed by 2017 at the earliest. As of 2018, the project remains on hold until further action is taken by the state legislature. The WSDOT puts the 2007 price tag for the highway at $480 million. However, only $43 million has been funded, requiring at least $437 million. Of this gap, only $50 million had been expected to be funded by a failed 2007 ballot initiative which in the end did not include the project.Wickert, David; \\"Base highway might get ax\\"; The News Tribune; May 11, 2007 These figures are expected to increase considerably due to rising costs of construction materials and fuel.

(real name: Dan J. Standiford) with Michael Kramer, who drums and sings and co-produces. Jetpack composes, records, and performs the guitar dominated instrumental music known as surf or surf rock, that was a music industry phenomenon of the early 1960s. Although it had retained a following, especially in Southern California, surf experienced a world-wide revival in the 1990s. Jetpack often mixes the traditionally accepted surf instruments, such as Fender guitars and tube amplifiers, with nontraditional instruments such as fretless bass and 12 string Rickenbacker guitars, and branches into other related subgenres of rock such as spy, noir, and rockabilly music. Live shows find the band usually dressed as FBI agents with I.D. badges and a secret service guard at the stage. History Originally, Jetpack released mainly original compositions with the exception of a few cover songs. Those cover songs would gain him attention and invitations to do reinterpretations of other artists' work. Jetpack's original live performances where in the late 1980s to early 1990s. His music and sound was heavily inspired by Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet and The Plugz. In the mid to late 1990s, he relocated to Los Angeles and drew the attention of Pascal Records. Pascal and Jetpack licensed music to MTV for the television program, The Real World. In late 1998, recording of a studio album was begun. It was completed in 1999, but awaited release until early 2000 due to a family tragedy. The release was titled Planet Reverb. Compilations / film and television Jetpack's \\"X-Files\\" look at The Roxy in Hollywood CA, March 2000 Daniel J. performed with Jetpack as a full band in many historical Los Angeles venues and was the opening act for Dick Dale, \\"King of the Surf Guitar\\". Later, Jetpack was placed on the same surf compilation as Dale with the 2003 release of Surf Guitar, a \\"best of\\" compilation of contemporary surf guitarists released by the Sharper Image. Pascal continued to license recordings for various compilations and films, Lion's Gate being one of the studios to feature Jetpack material in a film soundtrack. In 2004, Standiford was approached by CMH Records to produce material for their Vitamin Records division, which specialized in tribute albums. Due to his cover versions of the Hollie's \\"Bus Stop\\" and Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Sound of Silence\\", he was asked that the album feature only Jetpack and that he create a surf CD from twelve hits made famous by the band No Doubt. With Michael Kramer again adding his drumming skills to Jetpack, Surfin' to No Doubt was recorded and released in 2005. Later that year, Fuel TV featured original Jetpack music on its program, Longboard TV. 2009 saw the Dan performing with a lineup consisting of \\"moonlighting\\" members of other groups such as Oingo Boingo and the addition of a saxophone in many songs. A live release now awaits release.

The band's name is a reference to the character Shotaro Kaneda (Akira). The name Kill Kenada was chosen by accident, when lead singer Tim Smithen accidentally misspelled Kaneda, and the incorrect spelling has been maintained. History Kill Kenada first success was winning a battle of the bands contest in Portsmouth. They then went on to record some songs with Gordon Raphael, well known for producing the popular indie band The Strokes. Their first release was a limited edition 7\\" on SUBverse Recordings, a record label set up by the band. The first single release song \\"Choke\\", (released on 28 July 2003) received high praise from many media critics. 'Red And Black' was their next single but their first self-produced single with a Gordon Raphael-produced b-side \\"Hit The Floor\\"; released on 10 November 2003. Released with the single was a video on formats CD and 7\\". General and underground success followed. The band reached the top 5 in the MTV2 Chart, received radio airplay (as well as a Radio 1 live session with Zane Lowe). It emerged that Lowe was a huge fan; he ended the session by saying, \\"I feel very honoured to be involved with the band this early on....\\" The band toured in January and February 2004 with local friends, the relatively unknown band Bloc Party and Norwegian band Span. The band was then invited to play a special MTV2 show - Gonzo On Snow with Million Dead, Jetplane Landing and a few others on 24 March 2004. Their next release, \\"Massachusetts Murder Medallions\\" was already receiving airplay on MTV2. \\"Massachusetts Murder Medallions\\" (once again produced by Gordon Raphael) was released on 10 May 2004. The single was made available only on CD format and was also given a promo video. The video received many requests on MTV2, more radio airplay and a small fanbase. To converge with the release, the band went on tour with Ikara Colt, Bloc Party and Yourcodenameis:milo from May - June in 2004. The band also played with Jetplane Landing on 26 May 2004. A live recording of this whole gig exists but only a few people have the Kill Kenada set, with Jetplane Landing's set being used on their 'Courage/Danger' EP release. After taking a tour break of two months after their June tour to play 93feeteast with Yourcodenameis:milo on 5 August 2004 debuting new songs. The band then learnt that Steve Albini wanted to work with Kill Kenada, and a date was set to record with him. They made some new songs which were said to be a departure from their 'mental' old style, yet more focussed and aggressive. In August, 2005 then-drummer Stewart Fairhurst (aka 'Stoo') telephoned Tim and Danny to say that he would not be able to make the next practice and the recording session trip in September to Albini's 'Electrical Audio' studio in Chicago. The band found a new drummer in 'Eldge' who practiced solid for four weeks before he joined the group for the Heathrow flight to Chicago. Eight songs emerged from the 10-day recording period with Steve. The 10-month absence from public view called for Kill Kenada to revive fan interest. A CD-album of Gordon Raphael tunes was released on 28 September 2005. This was an album of songs that the group felt had long been overdue. They did their best to make it clear that this release was to hammer the final nail in the coffin for those songs (which could have been released ages ago) and to illustrate this, the release was very modest. The album was a simply pink CD in a pink wallet ‚Äì no artwork, no lyrics, no track list. Only 500 were made, each individually numbered and only available for purchase from their label's website ‚Äì SUBverse Recordings and from Rough Trade. During this time, the band returned to touring (September‚ÄìNovember, 2005) during which they were unexpectedly featured on Channel 4 news where it was reported that Kill Kenada was an aggressive art-rock trio from Bognor that independently released their singles through the Shellshock distribution network and their website. Their next release was not until 27 March 2006; 'Fly', featuring new drummer, Eldge and recorded by Justin Lockey of Yourcodenameis:milo) was a politically charged offering, with both their aggressive and soft, reflective modes both employed to great effect. The music of the single is organised in a timelike state to reflect the thoughts and feelings of anti-American terrorists (most notably those involved in 9/11) and took on-board their perspectives. The video for the song can be viewed online, and was made by Red Snow Studios who also made a video for the song from the Pink Album, \\"Sado Maso\\". The Pink Album had at the time never been seen. Due to the song's lyrics, it was a hard release to promote and the excitement behind promoting the song and single died down. After touring extensively, Kill Kenada released \\"In Your Throat\\" on 7\\" vinyl format only. The video reaching No. 1 in both the MTV2 NME Chart Show and MTV2's 'The Rock Chart Show'. The single also received radio airplay from many stations, most notably Radio 1's Zane Lowe who affectingly stopped the backing music to introduce the band's return. A live session on BBC6 Music's Tom Robinson show followed where the band performed \\"In Your Throat\\", \\"She's Red\\" and then premiered their current single at the time \\"Saline\\". On 12 March 2008 a message appeared on their official website: > FROM MAGGOTS 2 FLIES-----> WERE BACK! :) YO YO YO U MONKEYYYYS! HHHUH?

History Gare de Ville opened in 1849, replacing the temporary St. Pierre station which had opened in 1846 and subsequently became the site of a marshalling yard. It was rebuilt in 1888-89. In 1900, the metre gauge Chemin de Fer d'Anvin √† Calais (CF AC) was extended from St. Pierre to Calais-Ville, enabling the closure of St. Pierre. In the Second World War, Calais-Ville station had been severely damaged in 1940 during the Battle of France, and further damaged in 1944 when Calais was liberated by Allied forces. The remaining station buildings were demolished and temporary buildings erected to serve until the station was rebuilt. The CF AC closed on 1 March 1955.

Under King Manuel of Portugal, and when about seventeen, he was compelled to submit to baptism, but at the first opportunity fled to Salonica, where he could follow the dictates of his conscience in safety. In 1523 he went to Jerusalem, but in a short time returned to Salonica. In 1525 he settled permanently in Jerusalem, where his learning won him the position of chief rabbi. There he met Jacob Berab, with whom he often came into conflict on questions of rabbinical law. A serious quarrel broke out between these two rabbis when Berab, becoming chief rabbi of Safed, reintroduced the ancient practice of the ordination of rabbis. They carried on a bitter and envenomed controversy for some time, in the course of which Berab referred to Ibn Habib's adoption of Christianity. The latter frankly admitted the fact, but pointed out that at the time he was a mere youth, that his involuntary profession of Christianity lasted hardly a year, and that he took the first opportunity to escape and rejoin the religion of his fathers. This controversy was chiefly responsible for the fact that the practice of ordination ceased again soon after Berab's death. Writings He was knowledgeable in mathematics and astronomy. In his youth he edited his father's book Ein Yaakov (Constantinople, 1516; by Jacob ibn Habib). He wrote: She'elot u-Teshubot, a collection of 147 responsa; Kontres ha-Semikah, a treatise on ordination; Perush Kiddush HaChodesh, a commentary on Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh (rules governing the construction of the Hebrew calendar in Maimonides' code of law).

The party was formed by opponents of a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow incumbent President Olusegun Obasanjo to seek a third term in office, and had its base of support in the south west of Nigeria. The then Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, a northerner who opposed a third term for Obasanjo, was believed to back the new party from its inception. The ACD was largely made up of disgruntled PDP members who felt they had lost power and patronage to the President's supporters. Attempts by the President's supporters to amend the constitutional two term limit, allowing President Obasanjo to continue in office for a further four years, led to a rupture of the underlying tension within the party.

Geography The commune is located 16 kilometres (10 mi) southeast of Saint-Omer, at the junction of the N43 with several departmental roads, by the banks of the Leie (French: Lys) and the Laquette rivers. History Aire- sur-la-Lys is mentioned for the first time in 857. It developed around a fort or castrum built by Baldwin II, Count of Flanders in response to the Norman invasions. More growth followed with the establishment of the Collegiate church of Saint-Pierre by Baldwin V, Count of Flanders. The town was laid siege ten times between 1127 and 1710. It was separated from the County of Flanders and attached to the County of Artois in 1196. Subsequently ruled by the Burgundians then by the Spanish. The town was besieged in 1676 by VaubanUser:√âpim√©th√©e/Vauban-Intelligence, p 167 and retaken for France, although it remained a Spanish possession until 14 April 1713, when, by the Treaty of Utrecht, it finally became a part of France. Vauban‚Äôs stronghold, which was a strategic position, was dismantled in 1893. Population Sights =Collegiate Church of Saint-Pierre= The church is one of the most important monuments, with its imposing style, in Artois. It has all the characteristics of a cathedral, but in the absence of a bishop, it cannot claim that title. Witness to the splendour of the city, the collegiate church of Saint-Pierre is of Romanesque style. Built between 1492 and the eighteenth century, one can see both on the inside and the outside of the building carving that details the 400 years progress. It has been the parish church since 1802. The tower, completed in 1624, collapsed soon after. Ten years later, the damage was repaired. The top of the tower was again restored between May 2005 and April 2007. The ground floor, the nave, choir and high arches are essentially Gothic. The dimensions of the building are impressive: * Total external length: 105 metres * Total external width: 40 metres * Width of the central nave: 10 metres * Height of the tower: 66 metres It was classified a historical monument in 1862. =Le Bailliage= A Flemish Renaissance style building which was built between 1595 and 1600, as guardrooms for the militia of the city. It is commonly known as the Le Bailliage (Bailiwick), because at various times between 1634 and 1789, it served as the seat of the court bailiffs. In 1595, the mayor, one Jacques de Caverel had obtained permission from Brussels to raise taxes on beer and wine for the construction of the guardhouse on the city marketplace and the monument was inaugurated on 22 November 1600. The building itself is an irregular quadrilateral of 125m square, with 3 facades giving out onto the Grande Place, Rue d‚ÄôArras and what was then the Rue des Cuisiniers. The architect, Pierre Framery was inspired by the former Hotel de Ville at Amsterdam. Many restorations have been necessary over the centuries. The Bailliage has undergone various uses: guardhouse, courthouse, Town Hall and police headquarters in the 19th and 20th centuries. Since 1970, it has been the Tourist Office. The large room upstairs is used for exhibitions. The Bailiwick has been classified as an historic monument since 1886. =Town hall= After the return of Aire to the kingdom of France by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, King Louis XIV gave permission to build a new and more prestigious Town Hall, in recognition of the suffering of the city during the siege of 1710 under Dutch occupation. =Other historic buildings= The Bell- tower, classified as World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2005 * The Bell-tower, classified as World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2005.

It is commonly defined as any adaptation that has evolved, at least in part, to increase the reproductive success of the actor's social partners. For example, territorial choruses by male lions discourage intruders and are likely to benefit all contributors. This process contrasts with intragroup competition where individuals work against each other for selfish reasons. Cooperation exists not only in humans but in other animals as well. The diversity of taxa that exhibits cooperation is quite large, ranging from zebra herds to pied babblers to African elephants. Many animal and plant species cooperate with both members of their own species and with members of other species. In animals Cooperation in animals appears to occur mostly for direct benefit or between relatives. Spending time and resources assisting a related individual may at first seem destructive to an organism's chances of survival but is actually beneficial over the long-term. Since relatives share part of the helper's genetic make- up, enhancing each individual's chance of survival may actually increase the likelihood that the helper's genetic traits will be passed on to future generations. However, some researchers, such as ecology professor Tim Clutton- Brock, assert that cooperation is a more complex process. They state that helpers may receive more direct, and less indirect, gains from assisting others than is commonly reported. These gains include protection from predation and increased reproductive fitness. Furthermore, they insist that cooperation may not solely be an interaction between two individuals but may be part of the broader goal of unifying populations. Prominent biologists, such as Charles Darwin, E. O. Wilson, and W. D. Hamilton, have found the evolution of cooperation fascinating because natural selection favors those who achieve the greatest reproductive success while cooperative behavior often decreases the reproductive success of the actor (the individual performing the cooperative behavior). Hence, cooperation seemed to pose a challenging problem to the theory of natural selection, which rests on the assumption that individuals compete to survive and maximize their reproductive successes. Additionally, some species have been found to perform cooperative behaviors that may at first sight seem detrimental to their own evolutionary fitness. For example, when a ground squirrel sounds an alarm call to warn other group members of a nearby coyote, it draws attention to itself and increases its own odds of being eaten. There have been multiple hypotheses for the evolution of cooperation, all of which are rooted in Hamilton's models based on inclusive fitness. These models hypothesize that cooperation is favored by natural selection due to either direct fitness benefits (mutually beneficial cooperation) or indirect fitness benefits (altruistic cooperation). As explained below, direct benefits encompass by-product benefits and enforced reciprocity, while indirect benefits (kin selection) encompass limited dispersal, kin discrimination and the greenbeard effect. = Kin selection= One specific form of cooperation in animals is kin selection, which involves animals promoting the reproductive success of their kin, thereby promoting their own fitness. Different theories explaining kin selection have been proposed, including the \\"pay-to-stay\\" and \\"territory inheritance\\" hypotheses. The \\"pay-to-stay\\" theory suggests that individuals help others rear offspring in order to return the favor of the breeders allowing them to live on their land. The \\"territory inheritance\\" theory contends that individuals help in order to have improved access to breeding areas once the breeders depart. Studies conducted on red wolves support previous researchers' contention that helpers obtain both immediate and long-term gains from cooperative breeding. Researchers evaluated the consequences of red wolves' decisions to stay with their packs for extended periods of time after birth. While delayed dispersal helped other wolves' offspring, studies also found that it extended male helper wolves' life spans. This suggests that kin selection may not only benefit an individual in the long-term through increased fitness but also in the short-term through increased survival chances. Some research suggests that individuals provide more help to closer relatives. This phenomenon is known as kin discrimination. In their meta-analysis, researchers compiled data on kin selection as mediated by genetic relatedness in 18 species, including the western bluebird, pied kingfisher, Australian magpie, and dwarf mongoose. They found that different species exhibited varying degrees of kin discrimination, with the largest frequencies occurring among those who have the most to gain from cooperative interactions.  In plants  Cooperation exists not only in animals but also in plants. In a greenhouse experiment with Ipomoea hederacea, a climbing plant, results show that kin groups have higher efficiency rates in growth than non-kin groups do. This is expected to rise out of reduced competition within the kin groups.  Explanation  The inclusive fitness theory provides a good overview of possible solutions to the fundamental problem of cooperation. The theory is based on the hypothesis that cooperation helps in transmitting underlying genes to future generations either through increasing the reproductive successes of the individual (direct fitness) or of other individuals who carry the same genes (indirect fitness). Direct benefits can result from simple by-product of cooperation or enforcement mechanisms, while indirect benefits can result from cooperation with genetically similar individuals. = Direct fitness benefits = This is also called mutually beneficial cooperation as both actor and recipient depend on direct fitness benefits, which are broken down into two different types: by-product benefit and enforcement. By-product benefit arises as a consequence of social partners having a shared interest in cooperation. For example, in meerkats, larger group size provides a benefit to all the members of that group by increasing survival rates, foraging success and conflict wins. This is because living in groups is better than living alone, and cooperation arises passively as a result of many animals doing the same thing. By-product benefit can also arise as a consequence of subordinate animals staying and helping a nest that is dominated by leaders who often suffer high mortality rates. It has been shown that cooperation would be most advantageous for the sex that is more likely to remain and breed in the natal group. This is because the subordinate will have a higher chance to become dominant in the group as time passes. Cooperation in this scenario is often seen between non-related members of the same species, such as the wasp Polistes dominula. Prisoner's Delight, another term to describe by-product benefit, is a term coined by Kenneth Binmore in 2007 after he found that benefits can result as an automatic consequence of an otherwise \\"self-interested\\" act in cooperative hunting. He illustrated this with a scenario having two hunters, each hunter having the choice of hunting (cooperate) or not hunting (free-riding). Assuming that cooperative hunting results in greater rewards than just a one-player hunt, when hunting is not rare, both hunters and non-hunters benefit because either player is likely to be with other hunters, and thus likely to reap the rewards of a successful hunt. This situation demonstrates \\"Prisoner's Delight\\" because the food of a successful hunt is shared between the two players regardless of whether or not they participated.An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology. Davies, Nicholas B., John R. Krebs, and Stuart A. West. 2012. It has been shown that free riding, or reaping the benefits without any effort, is often a problem in collective action. Examples of free riding would be if an employee in a labor union pays no dues, but still benefits from union representation. In a study published in 1995, scientists found that female lions showed individual differences in the extent to which they participated in group-territorial conflict. Some lions consistently 'cooperated' by approaching intruders, while others 'lagged' behind to avoid the risk of fighting. Although the lead female recognized the laggards, she failed to punish them, suggesting that cooperation is not maintained by reciprocity. Cooperation is maintained in situations where free- riding is a problem through enforcement, which is the mechanism where the actor is rewarded for cooperating or punished for not cooperating. This happens when cooperation is favored in aiding those who have helped the actors in the past. Punishment for noncooperation has been documented in meerkats, where dominant females will attack and evict subordinate females who become pregnant. The pregnancy is seen as a failure to cooperate because only the dominant females are allowed to bear offspring. Dominant females will attack and kill the offspring of subordinate females if they evade eviction and eviction often leads to increased stress and decreased survival. Enforcement can also be mutually beneficial, and is often called reciprocal cooperation because the act of cooperation is preferentially directed at individuals who have helped the actor in the past (directly), or helped those who have helped the actor in the past (indirectly). = Indirect fitness benefits = The second class of explanations for cooperation is indirect fitness benefits, or altruistic cooperation. There are three major mechanisms that generate this type of fitness benefit: limited dispersal, kin discrimination and the green- beard effect. Hamilton originally suggested that high relatedness could arise in two ways: direct kin recognition between individuals or limited dispersal, or population viscosity, which can keep relatives together. The easiest way to generate relatedness between social partners is limited dispersal, a mechanism in which genetic similarity correlates with spatial proximity. If individuals do not move far, then kin usually surrounds them. Hence, any act of altruism would be directed primarily towards kin. This mechanism has been shown in Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, where cooperation is disfavored when populations are well mixed, but favored when there is high local relatedness. Kin discrimination also influences cooperation because the actor can give aid preferentially towards related partners. Since kin usually share common genes, it is thought that this nepotism can lead to genetic relatedness between the actor and the partner's offspring, which affects the cooperation an actor might give. This mechanism is similar to what happens with the green-beard effect, but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior have been found in hydrozoans, slime molds, yeast, and ants. An example is in side- blotch lizards, where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost. This strategy blue has evolutionary cycles of altruism alternating with mutualism tied to the RPS game.  Multi- level selection  Multi-level selection theory suggests that selection operates on more than one level: for example, it may operate at an atomic and molecular level in cells, at the level of cells in the body, and then again at the whole organism level, and the community level, and the species level. Any level which is not competitive with others of the same level will be eliminated, even if the level below is highly competitive. A classic example is that of genes which prevent cancer. Cancer cells divide uncontrollably, and at the cellular level, they are very successful, because they are (in the short term) reproducing very well and out competing other cells in the body. However, at the whole organism level, cancer is often fatal, and so may prevent reproduction. Therefore, changes to the genome which prevent cancer (for example, by causing damaged cells to act co-operatively by destroying themselves) are favoured. Multi-level selection theory contends that similar effects can occur, for example, to cause individuals to co-operate to avoid behaviours which favour themselves short-term, but destroy the community (and their descendants) long term.  Market effect  One theory suggesting a mechanism that could lead to the evolution of co-operation is the \\"market effect\\" as suggested by Noe and Hammerstein. The mechanism relies on the fact that in many situations there exists a trade-off between efficiency obtaining a desired resource and the amount of resources one can actively obtain. In that case, each partner in a system could benefit from specializing in producing one specific resource and obtaining the other resource by trade. When only two partners exist, each can specialize in one resource, and trade for the other. Trading for the resource requires co-operation with the other partner and includes a process of bidding and bargaining. This mechanism can be relied to both within a species or social group and within species systems. It can also be applied to a multi-partner system, in which the owner of a resource has the power to choose its co-operation partner. This model can be applied in natural systems (examples exist in the world of apes, cleaner fish, and more). Easy for exemplifying, though, are systems from international trading. Arabic countries control vast amounts of oil, but seek technologies from western countries. These in turn are in need of Arab oil. The solution is co-operation by trade.  Symbiosis  Symbiosis refers to two or more biological species that interact closely, often over a long period of time. Symbiosis includes three types of interactions‚Äîmutualism, commensalism, and parasitism‚Äîof which only mutualism can sometimes qualify as cooperation. Mutualism involves a close, mutually beneficial interaction between two different biological species, whereas \\"cooperation\\" is a more general term that can involve looser interactions and can be interspecific (between species) or intraspecific (within a species). In commensalism, one of the two participating species benefits, while the other is neither harmed nor benefitted. In parasitism, one of the two participating species benefits at the expense of the other. Symbiosis may be obligate or facultative. In obligate symbiosis, one or both species depends on the other for survival. In facultative symbiosis, the symbiotic interaction is not necessary for the survival of either species. Two special types of symbiosis include endosymbiosis, in which one species lives inside of another, and ectosymbiosis, in which one species lives on another. = Mutualism = Rhizobia nodules on Vigna unguiculata Mutualism is a form of symbiosis in which both participating species benefit. A classic example of mutualism is the interaction between rhizobia soil bacteria and legumes (Fabaceae). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals. Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the nitrogenase enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant as well as the protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the legume, this is an example of endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis. Lichens are another example of mutualism. Lichens consist of a fungus (the mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont), which is usually a green alga or a cyanobacteria. The mycobiont benefits from the sugar products of photosynthesis generated by the photobiont, and the photobiont benefits from the increased water retention and increased surface area to capture water and mineral nutrients conferred by the mycobiont. Many lichens are examples of obligate symbiosis. In fact, one-fifth of all known extant fungal species form obligate symbiotic associations with green algae, cyanobacteria or both. Not all examples of mutualism are also examples of cooperation. Specifically, in by-product mutualism, both participants benefit, but cooperation is not involved. For example, when an elephant defecates, this is beneficial to the elephant as a way to empty waste, and it is also beneficial to a dung beetle that uses the elephant's dung. However, neither participant's behavior yields a benefit from the other, and thus cooperation is not taking place.  Hidden benefits  Hidden benefits are benefits from cooperation that are not obvious because they are obscure or delayed. (For example, a hidden benefit would not involve an increase in the number of offspring or offspring viability.) One example of a hidden benefit involves Malarus cyaneus, the superb fairy-wren. In M. cyaneus, the presence of helpers at the nest does not lead to an increase in chick mass. However, the presence of helpers does confer a hidden benefit: it increases the chance that a mother will survive to breed in the next year. Another example of a hidden benefit is indirect reciprocity, in which a donor individual helps a beneficiary to increase the probability that observers will invest in the donor in the future, even when the donor will have no further interaction with the beneficiary. In a study of 79 students, participants played a game in which they could repeatedly give money to others and receive from others. They were told that they would never interact with the same person in the reciprocal role. A player's history of donating was displayed at each anonymous interaction, and donations were significantly more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions. Indirect reciprocity has only been shown to occur in humans. Prisoner's dilemma Cooperative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such cooperation could, potentially, be exploited by selfish individuals who do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils. Even if all members of a group benefit from cooperation, individual self-interest may not favor cooperation. The prisoner's dilemma codifies this problem and has been the subject of much research, both theoretical and experimental. In its original form the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) described two awaiting trial prisoners, A and B, each faced with the choice of betraying the other or remaining silent. The \\"game\\" has four possible outcomes: (a) they both betray each other, and are both sentenced to two years in prison; (b) A betrays B, which sets A free and B is sentenced to four years in prison; (c) B betrays A, with the same result as (b) except that it is B who is set free and the other spends four years in jail; (d) both remain silent, resulting in a six-month sentence each. Clearly (d) (\\"cooperation\\") is the best mutual strategy, but from the point of view of the individual betrayal is unbeatable (resulting in being set free, or getting only a two-year sentence). Remaining silent results in a four-year or six-month sentence. This is exemplified by a further example of the PDG: two strangers attend a restaurant together and decide to split the bill. The mutually best ploy would be for both parties to order the cheapest items on the menu (mutual cooperation). But if one member of the party exploits the situation by ordering the most expensive items, then it is best for the other member to do likewise. In fact, if the fellow diner's personality is completely unknown, and the two diners are unlikely ever to meet again, it is always in one's own best interests to eat as expensively as possible. Situations in nature that are subject to the same dynamics (rewards and penalties) as the PDG define cooperative behavior: it is never in the individual's fitness interests to cooperate, even though mutual cooperation rewards the two contestants (together) more highly than any other strategy. Cooperation cannot evolve under these circumstances. However, in 1981 Axelrod and Hamilton noted that if the same contestants in the PDG meet repeatedly (in the so-called iterated prisoner's dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by Robert Trivers' 1971 reciprocal altruism theory) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism. In \\"tit-for-tat\\" both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, which can only be rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, \\"generous tit-for-tat\\", which behaves like \\"tit-for-tat\\", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was \\"betray\\".), but all can be outperformed by at least one of the other strategies, should one of the players switch to such a strategy. The result is that none is evolutionarily stable, and any prolonged series of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, in which alternative strategies arise at random, gives rise to a chaotic sequence of strategy changes that never ends. Results from experimental economics show, however, that humans often act more cooperatively than strict self-interest would dictate. Evolutionary mechanisms suggesting that reciprocity is the result, not the cause, of the evolution of cooperation  In the light of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game and the reciprocal altruism theory failing to provide full answers to the evolutionary stability of cooperation, several alternative explanations have been proposed. A male peacock with its beautiful but clumsy, aerodynamically unsound erectile tail, which Amotz Zahavi believes is a handicap, comparable to a race horse's handicap. The larger the handicap the more intrinsically fit the individual (see text). handicap race carry the largest weights, so the size of the handicap is a measure of the animal's quality. There are striking parallels between cooperative behavior and exaggerated sexual ornaments displayed by some animals, particularly certain birds, such as, amongst others, the peacock. Both are costly in fitness terms, and both are generally conspicuous to other members of the population or species. This led Amotz Zahavi to suggest that both might be fitness signals rendered evolutionarily stable by his handicap principle. If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, the signal has to be evolutionarily costly. Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality. Zahavi borrowed the term \\"handicap principle\\" from sports handicapping systems. These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse handicap race, provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in amateur golf, better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a peahen, for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by his increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is his health. A cooperative act is, by definition, similarly costly (e.g. helping raise the young at the nest of an unrelated pair of birds versus producing and raising one's own offspring). It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case, cooperation is evolutionarily stabilized by sexual selection. An African pygmy kingfisher, showing details of appearance and coloration that are shared by all African pygmy kingfishers to a high degree of fidelity.Hockey, P.A.R., Dean, W.R.J., Ryan, P.G. (2005) Roberts Birds of Southern Africa, p. 176, 193. Trustees of the John Voelcker Bird Book Fund, Cape Town. There is an alternate strategy for identifying fit mates which does not rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is probably generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a non-silent mutation will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged is made up of fit attributes that have attained their plurality through natural selection, while less well adapted attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare.Fisher R. (1930) The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to prefer mates with the fewest unusual or minority features.Symons, D. (1979) The Evolution of Human Sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press. This will have the effect of a sexual population rapidly shedding peripheral phenotypic features, thereby canalizing the entire outward appearance and behavior of all of its members. They will all very quickly begin to look remarkably similar to one another in every detail, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph of the African pygmy kingfisher, Ispidina picta. Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviors will also be rendered evolutionarily stable, including any cooperative, altruistic and social interactions. Thus, in the example above of the selfish individual who hangs back from the rest of the hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate (koinophilia). Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.  History of cooperation research  One of the first references to animal cooperation was made by Charles Darwin, who noted it as a potential problem for his theory of natural selection.Darwin, C. The Origin of Species Ch VIII (The Modern Library, 1859/1958) In most of the 19th century, intellectuals like Thomas Henry Huxley and Peter Kropotkin debated fervently on whether animals cooperate with one another and whether animals displayed altruistic behaviors. In the late 1900s, some early research in animal cooperation focused on the benefits of group- living. While living in a group produces costs in the form of increased frequency of predator attacks and greater mating competition, some animals find that the benefits outweigh the costs. Animals that practice group-living often benefit from assistance in parasite removal, access to more mates, and conservation of energy in foraging. Initially, the most obvious form of animal cooperation was kin selection, but more recent studies focus on non-kin cooperation, where benefits may seem less obvious. Non-kin cooperation often involves many strategies that include manipulation and coercion, making these interactions more complicated to study. An example of manipulation is presented by the cuckoo, a brood parasite, which lays its eggs in the nest of a bird of another species. That bird then is tricked into feeding and caring for the cuckoo offspring. Although this phenomenon may look like cooperation at first glance, it only presents benefits to one recipient. In the past, simple game theory models, such as the classic cooperative hunting and Prisoner's dilemma models, were used to determine decisions made by animals in cooperative relationships. However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge of the strategies of other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals.No√´, R., van Hooff, J., and Hammerstein, P. Economics in Nature: Social Dilemmas, Mate Choice and Biological Markets Cambridge University Press (2001) The evolutionarily stable strategy is a refined version of the Nash equilibrium in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing cooperative relationships because they provide predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how cooperative relationships work.

Warwolf at Stirling When disassembled, the weapon would fill 30 wagons in parts. It reportedly took five master carpenters and forty-nine other labourers at least three months to complete.Prestwich, Michael, Edward I, University of California, (1988), 502 A contemporary account of the siege states, \\"During this business the king had carpenters construct a fearful engine called the loup-de-guerre [sic., War wolf], and this when it threw, brought down the whole wall.\\" Even before construction could be completed, Scottish soldiers offered surrender, fearing the weapon's potential to destroy the entire castle.

The Dark Age is a trilogy by Mark Chadbourn set around the beginning of the third millennium. While the previous series was a clear fantasy story, this has strings of gothic horror and existentialism woven into it. The three books are: *The Devil In Green *The Queen Of Sinister *The Hounds Of Avalon Although not a direct sequel to The Age of Misrule, it is a continuation of the world established by the end of this trilogy, the events of which are referred to as the Fall. It is followed by the Kingdom of the Serpent. At first the books appear to be standalone novels, however ultimately they weave together to form one larger story, as sub-plots and themes coalesce in the final book, and only by reading that can you see how it all holds together. They do not need to be read in order of publication, although The Hounds of Avalon does bring together the characters from the other two and is set after the events of The Queen of Sinister and The Devil in Green. This trilogy fits into a much bigger jigsaw, a sprawling story that covers two thousand years of history, multiple mythologies and two worlds, through The Age of Misrule and the Kingdom of the Serpent - again, the stories stand separately but a greater perception comes from reading all. The Devil in Green has been described as \\"a sumptuous feast of fairytale, magic, dark gothic horror and romance.\\" All through his books Chadbourn buries archetypes, specifically those of Jung, to get across his ideas and tap into the subconscious. He has the Hero, The Great Mother The Wise old man The Trickster and the Child subtly underpinning his characters. But he makes sure his characters are real and flawed. His heroes are not stereotypical high born achievers but ordinary individuals from normal or hard backgrounds. When interviewed about this series he has said: Plot introduction and setting The trilogy is set in Britain and the Otherworld or Far Lands. Technology is failing and magic has returned along with armies of mythical creatures, and Faerie folk from the Otherworld. Everyday people face the hardships of living in a world with little law and order, poor communications and a Government that is struggling to maintain power. Travelling is fraught with danger of attack from creatures and monsters from the Otherworld. Within the cities gang rule is taking place and it is never safe to venture out after dark. Mark Chadbourn uses the gods of Celtic mythology referred to as the Tuatha D√© Danann within his books and the idea that Ley lines and ancient sites such as Stone Henge are connections to, and areas of, the Earth's energy which he calls the Blue Fire. The ancient sites act as gateways to the Otherworld. He draws on the theories of Brane cosmology to create a multiverse, where time in one dimension moves at a different rate from another; one hour in our world could be days or weeks in another.  Plot summary  = The Devil in Green = The Devil in Green centres around Mallory, a recently recruited Knights Templar based at Salisbury Cathedral, his comrades and his relationship with a new age traveller/Wicca called Sophie. The Knights Templar and the remnants of the Christian Church are trying to restore some form of order within the sphere of their world. During a mission to rescue a vicar, Mallory finds himself in one of the courts of the Otherworld where he learns of his destiny as a Brother of Dragons; one of 5 chosen by Existence to help restore the balance of light vs. dark in our world. He returns to Salisbury to discover supernatural forces have surrounded the Cathedral laying it to siege. The priests become more fundamentalist after their leader is killed mysteriously and a sacred artefact with alleged powers is recovered. It falls to Mallory, with the help of Sophie to end the siege and overthrow the fundamentalist priests. During the siege his friend, Miller, is nearly crucified but saved when Cernunnos places a fabulous beast hatchling within him, infusing him with the Blue Fire. This leaves Miller with the ability to heal the sick. The story concludes with Mallory and Sophie heading off in search of their fellow Brothers and Sisters of Dragons. The title refers to Cernunnos: although he is worshipped by the pagans as a nature god and part of life, the Christians portray him as the Devil; hence, 'the Devil in Green' = The Queen of Sinister = An incurable plague is sweeping the country. Caitlin Shepherd, a local GP, is working all the hours to do what she can in her community. Caitlin's husband and young son succumb and die. Overcome by grief, Caitlin thinks she cannot continue, but is helped by her friend, Mary the local herbalist. Mary is visited by an old Professor named Crowther, who says Caitlin is a Sister of Dragons, and that she must find a cure for the plague in the Otherworld. Caitlin goes with Crowther, meeting up with three others; Mahalia, a teenage girl, Carlton, a mute boy, and lastly, Matt, who is looking for his missing daughter. Whilst in the court of Lugh in the Otherworld they rescue Jack, a teenager from our world, who was taken as a baby by the Tuatha D√© Danann during The Age of Misrule He has had placed within him a powerful weapon known as a Wish Hex. Caitlin is suffering from multiple personality disorder. Inside her mind are also Briony, Brigid, Amy, and a fourth persona that the others are terrified of. As Caitlin's group continue on their quest, Mary discovers that Caitlin is in danger, and sets off to help her. On the group‚Äôs journey to the House of Pain, the source of the plague, they are attacked and Caitlin is thrown back into our world, ending up in Birmingham Here we meet Thackery and Harvey, struggling to survive against the local gang who are killing plague victims. Life is bleak within the city and little hope remains. Thackery finds and takes care of Caitlin, who has retreated into herself and is non-communicative. Thackery is captured by the gang but rescued by Caitlin whose hidden persona emerges as The Morrigan. Caitlin, as The Morrigan, continues to the House of Pain. Once there she is given a choice to remain as its queen, with her son, in exchange for giving up being a Sister of Dragons, the fight for Existence and a cure for the plague. Meanwhile, Mary‚Äôs quest reaches its conclusion and she must confront her past in order to help save Caitlin. This she achieves, the plague is stopped and the story concludes with Mahalia, Jack and Crowther heading off into the Otherworld, Caitlin no longer tied to the House of Pain, but also no longer a Sister of Dragons nor the Morrigan's host. Her son is now free to pass on to the Afterlife with her husband. Thackery and Harvey follow her to the House of Pain and leave it with her. The title of the book is the position Caitlin is offered in her deal to save her son =The Hounds of Avalon= This story is set mainly in Oxford where the Government is trying to restore law and order after the Fall. Hunter, a Government special forces agent and his friend Hal, a Government office clerk are the central characters who find themselves Brothers of Dragons up against a dark power, The Void which wants to stamp out all of Existence. The Government want to round up the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons for their own end and this leads Hunter to capture Mallory and gets Sophie Shot. Believing her dead Mallory escapes with Hunter to seek out the remaining original Brothers and Sisters of Dragons. Hal keeps his identity as a Brother of Dragons secret but goes on his own mission to find out what he can to help the fight against the Void. He has several encounters with creatures from the Otherworld. Sophie is not dead but ends up in the Far Lands where she joins Caitlin Shepherd, no longer a Sister of Dragons. Caitlin regains the Morrigan and the two help Lugh and his court escape a siege before returning to Oxford. During the final battle against the Void's army, Hal is accused of killing the Prime Minister. This is a ruse by the Government to get all the Brothers and Sisters together in order to sacrifice them to The Void. The Government want law and order restored and see the unpredictability that magic, and the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons offer as a threat to this. The Void regains control, people return to their mundane ordinary lives and the world has reverted to how it was before The Age of Misrule Hal escapes The Void and enters the Blue Fire to travel through time and set in motion events to bring back the original leader of the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons, Jack Churchill, as Existence's last hope in the battle with the Void. The title of the book refers to The Hounds of Avalon, who once heard baying indicate the end of the world Characters in \\"The Dark Age Trilogy\\" Brothers and Sisters of Dragons: *Mallory is the first Brother of Dragons during the Dark Age. A cynical man, he was once a student of the Classics. The Tuatha call him the Dead Man, on account of him killing himself in another dimension and awakening in ours. His past troubles him and he resents authority. *Sophie Tallant is a priestess for a group called the New Celtic Nation, and becomes close to Mallory. She practises her craft and is able to visit Mallory in his dreams. She has strong beliefs and will stand up for them. *Caitlin Shepherd is a country GP. The death of her husband and son fracture her mind and she struggles to keep control of her multiple personalities. The Tuatha call her the Broken Woman. *Hunter is a Special Ops field leader for the remains of the SBS. He is tough, sharp talking, and a bit of a ladies man. He appears to take his brutal work in his stride but in reality remembers all the faces of those he has killed. His best friend is Hal. *Hal is a silent office-drone in the reconstituted British government. Withdrawn, his role in the coming conflict is discovered at the very end. He is full of self-doubt, but is good at problem solving. The Tuatha call him the Shadow Mage. Other important humans: *Jez Miller is Mallory's main friend in the Knights Templar. He joined because he believes in their cause and faith. He is naive and sees the good in everyone. *Mary is an old witch/herbalist who knows Caitlin. Self-loathing and alcoholic, she sees Caitlin as a daughter and makes her own sacrifice to bring the Goddess(the sacred feminine) back to the world. *Jack a teenager who has spent most of his life a prisoner of the Tuatha D√© Danann and been subjected to various experiments. He helps Caitlin and company escape from Lugh's court after they release him from his cell. Celtic gods (the Tuatha D√© Danann) and Courts: *Cernunnos one of the most powerful gods, appears in Devil in Green to aid Mallory and again in the Hounds of Avalon. His other half is the triple goddess. He leads the Wild Hunt, who once called cannot be stopped until a kill has been made *The triple Goddess or Mother, maiden crone, is searched for in Queen of Sinister and one of her aspects, the Morrigan is key to Caitlin's survival. *Rhiannon is queen of the Court of Peaceful Days. Mallory ends up there after being attacked on Salisbury Plain. Though this court has renounced violence, Rhiannon gives Mallory the sword of Llyrwyn *Lugh rules the Court of Soul's Ease. His court is the first Caitlin enters in the Queen of Sinister. Initially he is diminished because he no longer fights for Existence, but this changes and he fights in the final battle in the Hounds of Avalon. *Dian Cecht rules the court of The Final Word. Here experiments on humans are carried out and this is where Jack spent much of his life. Dian Cecht is the great healer of the Tuatha. Like a lot of the Tuatha he can appear cold and aloof but is fascinated by humans or Fragile Creatures as the Tuatha refer to them *Math lives in a tower in the court of Soul's Ease. He wears a mask of four different animals: a boar, a falcon, a salmon and a bear. Caitlin and Sophie approach him for aid in Hounds of Avalon. Major themes General themes of the trilogy are the core issues of our own Dark Ages - faith, plague/illness, war/politics. The books strip away the trappings of modern society to see how we would cope against the great challenges of life without our support network. The books look at the fallibility of human nature, and at what can happen when different beliefs clash. They also question the wisdom of those who seek power attaining it. The idea of an Afterlife is also included.

She was the daughter of George Stephanus de Beer (b. 1794).Illustrated at the Fireside, Spearhead 2004, Story In the winter months of 1843 Rachel was part of a trek from the Orange Free State to the south-eastern Transvaal. During one of their nightly stopovers, the members of the trek realised that a calf called Frik, much-beloved by their children, was missing. A search party was formed, in which Rachel and her six- year-old brother also took part. However, during the gathering dusk Rachel and her brother got separated from the search party and became lost. As the night progressed it got very cold and started snowing. Realizing that their chances of survival were slim, Rachel found an anthill hollowed out by an aardvark, took off her clothes, put them on her brother and commanded him to get into the hollowed-out anthill. She then lay in front of the opening of the anthill in order to keep out the cold. The children were found the next morning by the trekking party. Rachel was dead, but her brother had survived. It is possible that neither of the children existed, however. The history of the period is not well documented. To date no undisputed proof has been presented to substantiate any claims regarding Racheltjie de Beer. Fiction or not, Rachel de Beer is entrenched in the Afrikaner culture, which is evident by the number of streets and schools named after her, and musical pieces which have been inspired by her such as this performance from 2019. Genealogical perspective In the very comprehensive genealogical work ‚ÄúThe De Beer Family ‚Äì Three centuries in South Africa‚ÄùPage 72-77, Die De Beer-Familie ‚Äì Drie Eeue in Suid-Afrika, First edition, June 2000, Dawid W. de Beer & Jaleen de Beer, several pages are devoted to the Rachel de Beer story, looking at all the possibilities from the available genealogical data. It turns out that there was a De Beer family that fits the names and ages as mentioned in the original story quite closely. However, they lived 60 years later. If the incident happened in 1903 instead of 1843, this family would fit the facts quite nicely. It would also better explain why there is no mention of this story before the early 1900s. By the third edition of the workPage 80-85, Die De Beer-Familie ‚Äì Drie Eeue in Suid-Afrika, Third edition (CD only), March 2005, Dawid W. de Beer & Jaleen de Beer, more information has come to light to also eliminate this last possible scenario. The Rachel de Beer in this instance has been confirmed to have lived well into adulthood. Based on this research it seems unlikely that the story of Rachel de Beer is factual. Historical debate In October 2012, two Afrikaans journalists published their findings that the story of Racheltjie de Beer bears many similarities to that of the American heroine Hazel Miner. They wrote about it in the tabloid By, a weekly supplement of the three Afrikaans newspapers Die Burger, Beeld, and Volksblad.Was Racheltjie eintlik ‚Äôn Amerikaner? http://www.dieburger.com/By/Nuus/Was-Racheltjie-eintlik-n-Amerikaner-20121006 The very first story about Rachel appeared in print only about a month or three after the North Dakota Children's Home Finder gave Hazel Miner's (true) story the wider publicity that it had deserved. The Afrikaans journalists also posted a more elaborate paper on their findings to the web under the title Die laaste rits bewyse: Racheltjie is bloot 'n afspie√´ling van Hazel Miner (The last series of evidences: Little Rachel is merely a mirror image of Hazel Miner).Racheltjie is bloot 'n afspie√´ling van Hazel Miner References Category:1831 births Category:1843 deaths Category:Afrikaner people Category:White South African people Category:19th-century South African people Category:Great Trek Category:South African people of Dutch descent ","title":"Racheltjie de Beer"},{"id":"4839173","title":"Info-gap decision theory"},{"id":"4839182","title":"Genz≈ç Wakayama"},{"id":"4839198","text":"State Highway 54 (SH 54) is a highway maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) that runs from Interstate 10 and U.S. Route 90 in Van Horn north to US 62 and US 180 between Salt Flat and Pine Springs near Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The route, located in western Culberson County, is largely isolated passing through no cities or towns beyond Van Horn and intersecting no other highways between Van Horn and its northern terminus. Within Van Horn, the route has intersections with Business Interstate 10-D and Farm to Market Road 2185. The route was established early in the history of the Texas highway system originally beginning in Alpine and ending at the New Mexico state line near Carlsbad, NM. The route's length and termini have changed over the years as have the roads with which it intersect largely due to two factors. First in the early years was the development of the United States Highway system which incorporated many parts of the former length of the route and even resulted in the brief elimination of SH 54 as well as other former state highways it intersected. Later was the construction of I-10 at Van Horn that caused SH 54 to be extended to meet the Interstate and resulted ultimately in the realignment and eventual decommissioning of US 80 in western Texas and changes in the designation of the former route of US 80 through the town. History left This route was originally proposed in 1917 as part of a potential SH 10 beginning at the New Mexico state line, then proceeding south to Van Horn then southeast to Alpine before changing course to the northeast terminating in Fort Worth by way of Fort Stockton, Sonora, and Brady. In 1919, another proposal incorporated a route called SH 12 from New Mexico through Van Horn and then south to the Rio Grande. The road would then run parallel with the river to Brownsville and then travel along the Gulf Coast to Houston. In 1922, a further revision aligned this route similar to the current US 90 between Van Horn and Del Rio. SH 54 was originally established as a highway beginning at SH 3 in Alpine following the current US 90 to SH 1 in Van Horn. This original designation occurred on August 21, 1923, replacing part of the severely reworked SH 12. On July 18, 1924, SH 54 was extended along the present SH 54 and along US 62 and US 180 to the New Mexico state line near Carlsbad, NM. Over the next several years, many changes to the route were spurred by the creation of the United States Highway system. In 1927, US 90 was newly designated in Texas over a route that replaced the portion of SH 54 between Alpine and the combined route of the new US 80 and SH 1 in Van Horn. On January 18, 1928, SH 130, a predecessor of US 62 and US 180 was designated from the present northern terminus of SH 54 west to El Paso. It is unknown when SH 130 was constructed. On May 1, 1931, SH 3 was realigned westward concurrently with US 90 to Van Horn. SH 54 and SH 130 kept their designations as concurrent routes to US 62. In 1932, US 62 was created along SH 54 from the state line to SH 130 and then along SH 130 to El Paso. On January 24, 1936, the section east of SH 130 was transferred to SH 130. Between 1936 and 1940, US 90 was extended northward through Van Horn to US 62. On September 26, 1939, SH 54 and intersecting routes SH 1, SH 3, and SH 130 were all decommissioned in favor of their redundant U.S. highway routes. The decommissioning of SH 54 was short lived as US 90 was shortened on August 16, 1940 back to its previous terminus at US 80 in Van Horn, and SH 54 was again designated between Van Horn and US 62. In 1943, US 180 was designated over the route of US 62 at the northern terminus of SH 54. In 1953, construction began on FM 2185 from SH 54 in Van Horn into northeastern Culberson County. On July 30, 1976, SH 54 was extended westward over Loop 519 (US 80 Business) (now BI 10-D) and southward over US 90 to I-10. Changes to the route and its intersecting highways occurred again after the construction of the I-10 bypass at Van Horn. In 1975, US 80 was realigned along I-10 with its former route through town designated as State Highway Loop 519 although it was signed as US 80 Business. The following year, SH 54 was extended southward to terminate at I-10. In 1990, the designation of Loop 519 was changed to Bus. I-10-D. One year later, US 80 was decommissioned throughout western Texas. Route description Guadalupe Mountains viewed from SH 54 SH 54 begins at I-10 Exit 140A in Van Horn. From I-10 the route runs concurrently with US 90 north along Van Horn Dr. At Broadway Blvd., US 90 terminates and SH 54 turns east along Bus. I-10-D for half a block and then turns north along La Caverna St. The route intersects FM 2185 at Ninth St. before leaving Van Horn. North of town, the route passes through a gap between the Beach Mountains and the Baylor Mountains and then emerges onto a large salt basin. The route follows the western edge of the basin east of the Sierra Diablo and the Texas Parks and Recreation Department's Sierra Diablo Wildlife Management Area until the route reaches its northern terminus at US 62 and US 180 between Salt Flat and Pine Springs near Guadalupe Mountains National Park. Between Van Horn and its northern terminus, the route is isolated encountering no major intersections. Beyond Van Horn, the only community along the route is the ghost town of Daugherty north of town.

History Consall station, situated on the Churnet Valley Line of the NSR, was opened to both passengers and goods on 3 March 1902. The station was a quiet country station serving the needs of workers involved in the forge and nearby lime kilns. It was however, opened mainly for the small, nearby village. As with many stations in the 1960s, passenger numbers decreased to such an extent that the station was closed in 1965. Re-opening, and the Churnet Valley Railway During the 1970s a railway preservation base was set up at nearby Cheddleton station. This was later to become the base of the Churnet Valley Railway. The CVR had been slowly progressing in preserving the line when in the late 1990s they had reached the station site. The down (western) platform was still in existence but without any platform edging stones. These were replaced and this platform opened for passengers 11 July 1998. Construction later began on the replica station buildings which opened on 3 March 2002. The second track running through the station, which had served as a run-round loop, was made redundant when the line was extended to Froghall, so work began on resignalling this loop to allow two train operation on the line. This involved the addition of signals and a signal box to the station (the original line was double track throughout, so no box was ever located at Consall). To finish, the wooden up (eastern) platform was reconstructed so that the original 1902 shelter could be put back into use and so passing trains had a platform to call in the up direction. This platform was opened on 22 April 2005 and now the station is relatively complete and is the nerve centre of train operations on peak days due to the new passing loop and signal box.

Aerenchyma is a spongy tissue that forms spaces or air channels in the leaves, stems and roots of some plants, which allows exchange of gases between the shoot and the root.Sculthorpe, C. D. 1967. The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by London. The channels of air-filled cavities (see image to right) provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases such as oxygen and ethylene between the plant above the water and the submerged tissues. Aerenchyma is also widespread in aquatic and wetland plants which must grow in hypoxic soils.Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 pKozlowski, T. T. (ed.) 1984. Flooding and Plant Growth. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.  Aerenchyma formation and hypoxia  When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes.Dacey, J. W. H. 1980. Internal winds in water lilies: an adaptation for life in anaerobic sediments. Science 210: 1017‚Äì19. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors.Patrick, W. H., Jr. and Reddy, C. N. 1978. Chemical changes in rice soils. In Soils and Rice, pp. 361‚Äì79. Los BanÀú os, Philippines: International Rice Research Institute. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. In general, low oxygen stimulates trees and plants to produce ethylene.Kozlowski, T. T. (ed.) 1984. Flooding and Plant Growth. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.  Advantages  The large air-filled cavities provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases between the plant organs above the water and the submerged tissues. This allows plants to grow without incurring the metabolic costs of anaerobic respiration.Laing, H. E. 1940. Respiration of the rhizomes of Nuphar advenum and other water plants. American Journal of Botany 27: 574‚Äì81. Some of the oxygen transported through the aerenchyma leaks through root pores into the surrounding soil. The resulting small rhizosphere of oxygenated soil around individual roots support microorganisms that prevent the influx of potentially toxic soil components such as sulfide, iron, and manganese.

Design and development One of the last HA-1112-M1L Buch√≥ns, repainted to represent a German Bf109, with Luftwaffe markings, and still flying. It can be recognized by the exhaust pipes at the top of the nose, like the Spitfire (tri-blade propeller retrofitted) In 1942, the Spanish government arranged a manufacturing licence with Messerschmitt AG to build the Bf 109G-2, although the DB 605A engines, propellers, instruments and weapons were to be supplied from Germany. This proved impossible as Germany was incapable of meeting its own needs let alone Spain's, and only 25 airframes (without their tails) and less than half the necessary drawings were actually delivered.Fitzsimons, Bernard, ed. Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1978), Volume 11, p.1193, \\"HA-1109/1112\\". Consequently, Hispano Aviaci√≥n replaced the DB 605A engine with the 1,600 hp HS 89-12Z and the project was renamed Bf 109J by Messerschmitt. The HS 89-12Z engine performed a successful flight in a Bf-109E used as flying testbed, in Barcelona in 1944 and the first HA-1109-J1L made its maiden flight on 2 March 1945 in Seville, using a VDM propeller and lash-up engine mounting.Fitzsimons, p.1193, \\"HA-1109/1112\\". The remaining 24 airframes were flown during 1947-9 with Escher-Wyss props, but never became operational. In May 1951, a developed version, the HA-1112-K1L, improved the Hispano-Suiza, HS 17-12Z engine installation, and carried either one or two 12.7mm Breda machine guns and Pilatus eight-packs of 80mm rockets. Its three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic propeller earned it the nickname Tripala (\\"three blades\\"). It first flew in 1951, and although 200 were planned only 65 were built. The Hispano engine was an upright V12 instead of the inverted V12 Daimler-Benz DB 601 & 605 engines used in the Bf 109 but, being of compact design, it fitted the airframe of the Bf 109 well and was able to credibly represent the Bf 109 in the German 1957 film Der Stern von Afrika (The Star of Africa) about Luftwaffe ace Hans- Joachim Marseille. The original design, starting with the Bf 109F, had an asymmetrical tail-fin aerofoil with a left deflection to counteract the torque from the Daimler-Benz's counter-clockwise rotation. Because this was left unchanged in the Buch√≥n despite the Hispano V12 having a clockwise rotation, the tail and the engine together induced a right swing on takeoff that was hard to counteract. A second version, the HA-1110-K1L, was a two-place tandem trainer model. =HA-1112-M1L= Hispano Aviaci√≥n HA-1112 Buch√≥n on display at the Air Zoo The \\"Rote Sieben\\" (Red-7), a privately owned Hispano HA-1112-M1L Buchon rebuilt as a Bf 109G in Germany The final variant was the HA-1112-M1L Buch√≥n (Pouter), which is a male dove in Spanish. It first flew on 29 March 1954 with a 1,600 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 500-45Fitzsimons, p.1194, \\"HA-1109/1112\\". engine and Rotol propeller, both purchased as surplus from the UK. This engine had a chin intake, that altered the lines of the Bf 109's airframe. It was an improvised assembly of outdated components but this was appropriate for the intended purpose of controlling Spanish colonial territories in Africa, where more sophisticated technology was both unnecessary and unavailable in isolated Spain at the time. It carried two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza 404/408 cannons and two Oerlikon or Pilatus eight-packs of 80 mm rockets and remained in service until 27 December 1965. Due to their longevity, Buch√≥ns have appeared in several war films masquerading as Bf 109Es and Gs. in movies such as Battle of Britain (alongside CASA 2.111 bombers, a Spanish-built version of the Heinkel He 111), Der Stern von Afrika, Memphis Belle, Dunkirk, and The Tuskegee Airmen.

Football career On leaving school,Football Jottings, The Cobram Courier, (Thursday, May 1895), p.5. he joined the Essendon Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). =VFA= Thurgood played for Essendon in the VFA in 1892‚Äì94,. At six feet tall (183 cm) and twelve stone (76.2 kg), Thurgood possessed qualities that made him a versatile key position player: he was extraordinarily fast, a superb mark, and very nimble and agile. His greatest asset was his kicking. Usually playing at centre half- forward, he could regularly kick distances up to 65-70 yards and beyond. Thurgood kicked 64 goals in 1893, and 63 in 1894. In the last two games for 1893, he scored 21 goals: nine of Essendon's ten goals against North Melbourne, and twelve of Essendon's fourteen goals against Richmond the following week, all extraordinary feats giving the low scoring of the era. He played 57 VFA games for Essendon and kicked 183 goals. =WAFA= In 1895 he left Essendon to seek work in Western Australia, and played for the Fremantle Football Club (not connected to the current club of the same name) in the Western Australian Football Association (WAFA). During his stint there he topped the WAFA goal kicking list on three consecutive occasions between 1895 and 1897, helping the side lift premierships in the first two of those years. =VFL= He returned to Victoria in 1898 and sought to resume his career with Essendon in the newly formed Victorian Football League (VFL, later AFL) but the VFL denied him a permit for residential reasons. Forced to sit out of football in 1898, he finally took the field for Essendon in 1899, and headed the club's goalkicking list in 1900 (25) and 1902 (33). While contemporaries noted that Thurgood was slower, heavier and less keen, he produced his finest performance in the 1901 VFL Grand Final against Collingwood when he kicked three of the side's six goals and was a major contributor to Essendon's victory. The same year, he won Essendon's Club Champion award. In 1902, a mysterious player, only identified as \\"Goodthur\\", played in two matches for Essendon at the time that Thurgood was serving a three match suspension for striking St Kilda footballers Mick English and Alf Trevillian: in the back- pocket, against Fitzroy on 14 June 1902 (round 8),League Matches: Essendon v. Fitzroy, The Herald (Saturday, 14 June 1902), p.4.\\"Follower\\" in The Age () noted that \\"Goodthur\\" (in quotes) played well. and in the ruck, against Melbourne on 5 July 1902 (round 10).League Matches: Essendon v. Melbourne, The Herald (Saturday, 5 July 1902), p.4.\\"Follower\\" in The Age () listed \\"Goodthur\\" (in quotes) as one of Essendon's best players.Football historians Michael Maplestone and Stephen Rogers, through a process of elimination, believe that the mysterious \\"Goodthur\\" was, in fact, Fred Mann, and was not Thurgood playing under a nom de guerre (Maplestone (1996) p.61). The current VFL/AFL player statistics for Fred Mann in rounds 8 and 10 reflects their view: In 1902 there were widespread allegations that he had 'laid down' against Collingwood in the Challenge Final, which Essendon lost by the heavy margin for the time of 33 points. In disgust, Thurgood demanded, and was refused, a clearance to the Magpies, whereupon he decided to retire. He was tempted back to Essendon four years later, but after playing eight games he was forced to retire permanently when he sustained a serious ankle injury. He held four records at his retirement: his 1893 season total was a Victorian record until 1915, his 12 goals in a match until 1919, his career total of 272 goals was an Essendon record until broken in Round 8, 1935 by Keith Forbes, his record place kick of 107 yards, 2 ft 1 in (98.48m) with slight wind assistance at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground 22 June 1899 still stands as the longest place kick in history by a footballer of any code.  After football  He was also a solid cricketer, playing three first XI matches for the North Melbourne Cricket Club during the 1890s; he was also an avid golfer. After his retirement from football, Thurgood became active in horse racing‚Äîfor some years as a bookmaker and subsequently as an owner. He ran a number of successful horses, including Amazonia, which won the Bagot Handicap in 1921 and was placed third in the Melbourne Cup that year. In 1996, Thurgood was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. He was named in the Essendon Team of the Century, which was selected in their VFL/AFL centenary year of 1997. Nicknamed \\"The Great\\", he was inducted into the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 as an inaugural inductee.http://www.wafootballhalloffame.com.au/inductees/5059-albert-thurgood  Champions of Essendon  In 2002 an Essendon panel ranked him at 9 in their Champions of Essendon list of the 25 greatest players ever to have played for Essendon.  Honours  The Fremantle Football Club and Essendon Football Club created the \\"Albert Thurgood Challenge\\" to be played between the two teams. The first ever meeting was known as D-Day. On 11 February 1995 Fremantle won its first official game of AFL, defeating Essendon by 50 points at East Fremantle Oval.

History Cheddleton station, situated on the Churnet Valley Line of the NSR, was opened to passengers and goods on 1 September 1849. The station was a quiet country station serving the needs of nearby Cheddleton village, and for a time, the settlement of Ipstones, which is out of the valley. As with many stations in the 1960s, levels of traffic decreased to such an extent that the station was considered non-viable and closed to both passengers and goods in 1965. Cheddleton before closure Churnet Valley Railway early days During the 1970s a railway preservation base was established at Cheddleton railway station. This was due to a campaign by local people, spearheaded by local businessman and resident Norman Hancock, who in May 1974 as a mark of protest parked his Jaguar car on the level crossing where the railway line meets Basford Bridge Lane in Cheddleton. Following his actions and with support from a local campaign the station building was saved from demolition and became a grade II listed building on 14 May 1974. Cheddleton Station later became the base of the Churnet Valley Railway and has a commemorative plaque dedicated to Hancock on the wall. Initially, there was a railway museum displaying artefacts relating to the North Staffordshire Railway. In 1978 the NSRS became the North Staffordshire Railway Co. (1978) Ltd, and it became a charity in 1983. Later the bay platform area was acquired in 1984 and a former NSR signal box was put into use. The Churnet Valley line finally closed for sand traffic in 1988 and the NSRC jumped at the chance to purchase the line from British Rail by publicising its share prospectus. The first passenger train to leave Cheddleton onto the mainline under CVR control left for on 24 August 1996.  Later developments  Since the first trains ran in 1996 the CVR has grown with Cheddleton remaining its headquarters. The station area has benefited from temporary buildings on the opposite side to the original, housing a shop and tea room. The yard to the south of the platforms has progressively expanded with several roads, an inspection pit, and carriage shed being some of the facilities now in use as well as the main engine shed that was built early on. Recently the second platform has been reconnected to the main line by means of a siding which will one day form a loop to pass trains on.  Cheddleton tunnel  Just to the north of the station lies the long Cheddleton Tunnel.

In 1989‚Äì90, he was a key member (watch leader) of Fazisi the only Soviet Union entry to the Whitbread Round the World Race. Later, Eugene Platon brought his sailing/navigation and management experience to the Ukrainian team that for the first time in history entered Whitbread Round the World Race on board Hetman Sahaidachny in 1993‚Äì94. Competing with the world's top sailors, Platon was successful in skippering and navigating the Ukrainian yacht into 7th place overall, despite the fact that other competitors had significantly larger budgets. Eugene Platon (1959) is a native of Republic of Moldova, previously U.S.S.R. In 1982, he graduated from MIPT with a M.S. degree as a qualified Engineer in Applied Mathematics and Control Science. Early practical sailing and navigation experience made Eugene Platon one of the best yacht racing skippers on the Black Sea, and he got even more advanced with his sailing and navigation skills while having the experience of ocean yacht racing. Having sailed the Volvo Ocean Race twice (1989-90 and 1993-94), Platon also combined his skipper and navigator knowledge with yacht‚Äôs design and construction. \\"Hetman Sahaidachny\\" was a new generation of ocean racing yachts, - the high tech Whitbread 60 design. Using a design from top naval architect Bruce Farr, \\"Hetman Sahaidachny\\" was built under the direct management of Eugene Platon with advanced aerospace technology. For \\"Fazisi\\", Platon was also instrumental in the construction of the vessel. Eugene Platon was the leader of the Russian Project for the 2008-09 Volvo Ocean Race.

Alternately, Dyfnwal could have represented a more distant branch of the same dynasty.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 4.

Until the fall of Al Clud, for example, the rulers of the realm were styled after the fortress; whereas following the loss of this site, the Kingdom of Al Clud came to be known as the Kingdom of Strathclyde in consequence of its reorientation towards Ystrad Clud (Strathclyde), the valley of the River Clyde.Driscoll, ST (2015) p. 5; Clarkson (2014) ch. 3 ¬∂ 11; Edmonds (2014) pp. 200‚Äì201; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 8 ¬∂ 23; Clarkson (2012b) ch. 11 ¬∂ 46; Clarkson (2010) ch. 8 ¬∂ 26; Downham (2007) p. 162 n. 158; Clancy (2006b); Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

Although the precise chronology is uncertain, by 927 the southern frontier appears to have reached the River Eamont, close to Penrith.Dumville, DN (2018) pp. 72, 110, 118; Edmonds (2015) pp. 44, 53, 62; Charles-Edwards (2013a) p. 20; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 9, 481; Oram (2011) ch. 2; Parsons (2011) p. 138 n. 62; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 10; Davies (2009) p. 73, 73 n. 40; Downham (2007) p. 165; Woolf (2007) p. 154; Clancy (2006b); Todd (2005) p. 96; Hicks (2003) pp. 35‚Äì38; Stenton (1963) p. 328. The catalyst for this southern extension may have been the dramatic decline of the Kingdom of Northumbria at the hands of conquering Scandinavians,Lewis (2016) p. 15; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 9, 481‚Äì482; Oram (2011) ch. 2; Breeze (2006) pp. 327, 331; Hicks (2003) pp. 35‚Äì38, 36 n. 78; Woolf (2001); Macquarrie (1998) p. 19; Fellows-Jensen (1991) p. 80. and the expansion may have been facilitated by cooperation between the Cumbrians and insular Scandinavians in the late ninth- and early tenth century.Evans (2015) pp. 150‚Äì151; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 481‚Äì482. Amiable relations between these powers may be evidenced by the remarkable collection of contemporary Scandinavian-influenced sculpture at Govan.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 482; Clarkson (2010) ch. 8 ¬∂ 24; Downham (2007) pp. 162, 170. Attestation After Eochaid's career, the next notice of the Cumbrian realm is the record of Dyfnwal's death preserved by the ninth- to twelfth-century Chronicle of the Kings of Alba.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬ß 4; Downham (2007) p. 163. This is Dyfnwal's only attestation, and his appearance in this source could confirm that he was indeed related to the earlier rulers of Strathclyde.Hudson (1998) p. 157 n. 39. In any case, one particular passage of the chronicle notes the deaths of five kings during the reign of Dyfnwal's Scottish counterpart, Custant√≠n mac √Åeda, King of Alba. Dyfnwal is the second of these five; the king before him is Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in; the ones after him are Domnall mac √Åeda, Flann Sinna mac Ma√≠l Sechnaill, and Niall Gl√∫ndub.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4 ¬∂ 13, 4 n. 11; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂¬∂ 4, 17; Downham (2007) pp. 163‚Äì164; Woolf (2007) pp. 126‚Äì128, 157; Broun (2004b) pp. 132‚Äì133; Davidson (2002) pp. 129 n. 96, 130; Hudson (2002) p. 37; Dumville, D (2000) p. 77; Hudson (1998) pp. 140, 150, 156‚Äì157, 156 n. 38, 157 nn. 39‚Äì42; Broun (1997) pp. 118‚Äì119 n. 35; Hudson (1994) pp. 56, 71, 174 n. 5; Anderson (1922) pp. 445‚Äì446; Skene (1867) p. 9. Although Dyfnwal's death is not specifically dated by the chronicle, the context of the passage suggests that it took place in 908√ó915.Downham (2007) p. 163; Davidson (2002) p. 130. Therefore, if the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is to be believed, Dyfnwal died no later than 915.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4 ¬∂ 14.

Dyfnwal's descendants are recorded to have ruled the Kingdom of Strathclyde into eleventh century.Broun (2004b) p. 136. The personal name ' was commonly employed by the Cumbrian royal dynasty. This name lays behind the place name of Dundonald/Dundonald Castle (), derived from the British *Din Dyfnwal.

It is located on a steep hill overlooking the River Almond and Calder Wood, around west of Edinburgh. The settlement has been on a major crossroads since its origin some time in the eleventh century. History A flame barrage demonstration staged by the Petroleum Warfare Department 28 November 1940 James Sandilands received the lands of Calder from his brother-in-law, William IV, Lord of Douglas, in the 14th century. During the Wars of Scottish Independence, Sir James de Sandilands distinguished himself in the wars against the English. For his services he was rewarded with a royal charter of his lands by David II of Scotland. James was well connected and married Eleanor, the only daughter of Sir Archibald Douglas, Regent of Scotland.http://www.scotweb.co.uk/info/sandilands/ The gift included extensive estates in what is now West Lothian, and the Barony of Calder. After the Reformation in 1560, Sir James Sandilands, the head of the Sandilands family, was created Lord Torphichen. Since 1348 the family seat has been at Calder House,http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst8109.html near to the middle of the village. Kirk of Calder. For centuries a large part of the economy of the Scottish Highlands revolved around the breeding and trading of Highland cattle. They were moved along drove roads from all parts of the country, including some of the islands, to trysts or markets held in Crieff and Falkirk. Most of the cattle would then be driven south to feed consumers in England. Several of the drove routes used came together at Mid Calder. Huge herds of cattle would come across fords or bridges over the River Almond before crossing the Pentland Hills to West Linton. The peak year was 1840 when some 150,000 cattle passed through the area over the three months from August to October. This traffic helped support no fewer than nine public houses in the village. Meanwhile, Mid Calder also lay on the main turnpike road from Edinburgh to Glasgow, adding a steady flow of east‚Äìwest traffic to the seasonal influx of drovers heading south. However, the importance of the turnpike lessened at the same time as the cattle droving stopped, and for the same reason: the railways. And for once the acumen and foresight that had allowed the Sandilands to retain their position for so many centuries missed a beat. When the railway came to West Lothian in 1848, the then Lord Torphichen decreed that it should not come near Calder House. As a result, Mid Calder was served by a station at Kirknewton, three miles away which was called Mid Calder until 1982. This meant that adapting to the loss of its traditional sources of income could have been difficult for the village. But at precisely the right moment the world's first oil boom occurred, in West Lothian. This was based on oil extracted from shale, and by 1870 over 3 million tons of shale were being mined each year in the area around Mid Calder. Output declined with the discovery of liquid oil reserves around the world in the early 1900s, but shale mining only finally ceased in 1962. The \\"bings\\" that characterise oil shale mining elsewhere in West Lothian have largely been flattened around Mid Calder and the land reclaimed for recreation, industry and housing. Another major factor leading to Mid Calder's current prosperity has been the dramatic growth of nearby Livingston, now the second largest settlement in the Lothians and whose main shopping centre is only a mile to the west. The outlying areas of Mid Calder were heavily built upon in the 1980s, and as a result, middle-class housing estates are a stone-throw away from both Calder House and woodlands. Mid Calder is also home to Lodge St John Mid Calder number 272 on the Roll of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. This Freemason lodge was formed on 4 May 1818 (although Freemasonry was active in the area since at least the 1750s). Since 1936 the lodge has owned its own building at the entrance of the Calder Wood Country Park. In 2005, Mid Calder was subject to unwanted publicity when it became the first place in Britain to issue an ASBO in a village-wide crackdown on the anti-social behaviour of drunken teenagers. The ASBO allowed police to disperse any young person found outdoors. After one month of operation, the order was deemed a success. Public Services Waste collection services are provided by West Lothian Council, Water and Sewage services are provided by Scottish Water. Crime The local police force for Mid Calder is Police Scotland and the village is in East Livingston and East Calder policing ward. Following the closure of the police station that was located on Market Street in Mid Calder, the policing ward's station is at Broxburn.

History left SH 55 was designated from Rocksprings to La Pryor on August 21, 1923, replacing SH 3E and a portion of SH 4. On March 16, 1925, it extended south to SH 2 near Cactus. On October 26, 1926, it was rerouted to Bart. On October 10, 1927, it extended south through Catarina and then east to Artesia Wells. On August 6, 1929 (effective on September 1), SH 55 was truncated to Uvalde, with everything south of there being transferred to SH 4, and the section from Catarina to Artesia Wells was cancelled in exchange for the extension of SH 4. On October 25, 1932, SH 55 extended north to its current terminus. On November 30, 1932, SH 55 was extended south through Batesville and Dilley to San Diego. On July 15, 1935, SH 55 was shortened to a route from Rocksprings to Uvalde. On January 18, 1937, SH 55 extended to Dilley again. On February 11, 1937, SH 55 extended back north to SH 30. The portion from Uvalde to 4.8 miles southeast of Batesville and from Divot to Dilley were to be constructed starting on March 26, 1942, but upon completion, these sections of SH 55 were to be cancelled and changed to Farm to Market Roads. The section south of Uvalde was cancelled on January 11, 1945, and the portion from Uvalde to 4.8 miles south of Batesville was transferred to FM 117.

It was written and performed by the little-known Doug Wood Band in 1976, but since then it became better known as the theme song to the BBC's snooker coverage. It was released as part of the \\"BBC Snooker Themes\\" EP, released on BBC Records in 1984 (RESL 144), and is credited to The Douglas Wood Group. This version, however, differs slightly from the original 1976 recording, as sounds of snooker balls have been added to the start of the track. For this reason, the copyright date is shown on the record as 1982. The original track, without those modifications, can be found as track 6 of the CD \\"The Great Sporting Experience\\", published by EMI in 1998 (CD GOAL 1). This is credited to Doug Wood Group, licensed from Studio G. BBC Sport no longer uses this particular track as the main theme of snooker coverage. Instead, it has been heavily updated and remixed a number of times. The 2003 version was entitled \\"147 Lockdown\\" by Sheldon Southworth presumably in reference to British speed garage act 187 Lockdown. The version currently airing is by Timo Baker of T Minus 50. Since the coverage of the 2008 888.com World Snooker Championship, the BBC began to use the original version of Drag Racer again, during session breaks on their Interactive service. It is played over a caption of forthcoming matches. Although the entire track was used initially, tournaments after this date feature the track shortened, and edited into a continuous loop.

The algorithm takes as input a set of promoter sequences, and a motif width(w), and as output, produces a ranked list of 30 predicted motifs(each motif is defined by a set of N sequences, where N is a parameter). The algorithm firstly indexes each sub-sequence of length n, where n is a parameter around 4-6 base pairs, in each promoter, so they can be looked up efficiently. This index is then used to build a list of all pairs of sequences of length w, such that each sequence shares an n-mer, and each sequence forms an ungapped alignment with a substring of length w from the string of length 2w around the match, with a score exceeding a cut- off. The pairs of sequences are then scored. The scoring function favours pairs which are very similar, but disfavours sequences which are very common in the target genome. The 1000 highest scoring pairs are kept, and the others are discarded. Each of these 1000 'seed' motifs are then used to search iteratively search for further sequences of length which maximise the score(a greedy algorithm), until N sequences for that motif are reached.

The population of the barrio is 29,547 (January 2006), divided into three areas: Aravaca (23,145), Valdemar√≠n (4,000) and El Plant√≠o (2,469) History During the Spanish Civil War, for example, the second war twi, Aravaca was on the front line for three years in the Siege of Madrid (1936-39). One may still find military bunkers used by Franco's attacking troops in the parks and woods. The old town was completely devastated and was rebuilt in the forties. Dating from this years are the parish church and some houses in Baja de la Iglesia street, all designed in the old Castilian style. Until 1951 Aravaca was an independent city within Madrid province with its own town hall and mayor. During the long Spanish postwar period (1940-1959) millions of Spaniards left their homes in the poor provinces to migrate to industrial areas such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and the Basque Country. Aravaca grew quickly between 1950 and 1980 and became a middle-class residential suburb. From 1990, thanks to new urban plans, the population of Aravaca has doubled and the streets are now connected with the neighbouring town of Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n. The population today is about 30,000 people, mainly commuters who work in Madrid and in the metropolitan area.

The vegetation type is found on poor substrates with low, erratic winter rainfall. The ecoregion contains an outstanding proportion of endemic plant species and is part of the Global 200. Flora Around 95% of the original flora in the spiny forests is endemic, which makes it the most unique ecoregion in Madagascar. Many constituent plants show extreme adaptations to drought. Spiny plants of the endemic subfamily Didiereoideae form a conspicuous component, especially towards the east. They are woody but distantly related to the cacti. The remaining component of the forests is dominated by members of the plant families Burseraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Anacardiaceae and Fabaceae, all of which have representatives elsewhere. Fauna Notable inhabitants of the spiny thickets include the spider tortoise (Pyxis arachnoides) and the radiated tortoise (Astrochelys radiata), the gecko Ebenavia maintimainty, several lemurs including Verreaux's sifaka, Grandidier's mongoose, and eight endemic birds. Conservation Existing reserves protect a maximum of 3% of the remaining vegetation, including Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, Berenty Reserve, and Beza Mahafaly Reserve. Andohahela National Park offers limited protection through its 'parcel 3' section. Elsewhere the spiny forest habitat is under pressure from human exploitation.

History Leek Brook railway station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) in 1904. It consisted of an island platform with two faces on the line from and and a single platform on the down (i.e. Leek bound) direction of the Churnet Valley Line. The railway station was a very quiet station not even advertised in timetables and was described by the NSR as a halt. The Churnet Valley platform was mainly used as an interchange platform with the St Edwards Hospital tramway using the other side of the platform. Passengers to and from Stoke-on-Trent used the platforms on the Stoke-Leek line and walked over to the Churnet Valley platform to catch a tram to the hospital. Passengers wishing to head south on the Churnet Valley line towards Uttoxeter would have to catch a northbound train to Leek and then return through Leek Brook on a south bound train. Leek Brook railway station closed to all traffic on 7 May 1956, the hospital railway had already closed two years previously in November 1954.  Churnet Valley Railway  During the 1970s a railway preservation base was set up at nearby Cheddleton railway station. This was later to become the base of the Churnet Valley Railway (CVR). The CVR had slowly been progressing in preserving the line when in the late 1990s they had reached the site of Leek Brook station which, however, was not judged worthy of re-opening due to the large amount of other preservation projects being undertaken by the CVR at the time and the poor access to the site. The first CVR passenger service to the station site was on 24 August 1996 and Leek Brook is currently (though normally) the northern terminus of the CVR, even though special occasional events see some trains continue beyond the site towards Cauldon Low, of course, (which has done since November 2010). There is no public access to the station, so neither boarding not alighting is possible there. Trains stop there only to detach the locomotive from one end of the train and run round to attach it to the other.

Produced by Chas Chandler, it is the third track from the album Axis: Bold as Love. The lyrics refer to a club near Seattle, where Hendrix sometimes played early in his career. The song was a staple of live shows and several live recordings were released after Hendrix's death. Background The lyrics were inspired by Hendrix's high school years (roughly 1958-1961), when he regularly visited a roadhouse called \\"The Spanish Castle\\". The club was south of Seattle in what was then unincorporated King County (now the city of Des Moines, Washington). It was built in the 1930s to avoid Seattle's then restrictive nightclub laws. By 1959, the club began featuring top local rock groups such as The Fabulous Wailers and occasional touring stars. Events were hosted by Pat O'Day, Seattle's best known disc jockey of the era. Recording The song features Noel Redding playing an eight-string Hagstrom bass routed through an Octavia effects unit, which Hendrix later overdubbed using the same bass. Hendrix also overdubbed some jazz chords on piano, which he had heard sound engineer Eddie Kramer playing. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro commented on the song's instrumentation: \\"[The] guitar and bass in unison has the immediate effect of locking up a song in a strong rhythmic voice ... [Hendrix uses] some unusual chord progressions and a large number of bend in the solo ending up with a crazy double-stop.\\" AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald calls the progression \\"proto-heavy metal\\" and compares it to the earlier Experience song, \\"Foxy Lady\\". Live releases \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" is one of the few songs from Axis: Bold as Love that Hendrix regularly performed in concert. Live recordings of the song are found on BBC Sessions, Live at the Oakland Coliseum, Stages, Live in Ottawa, Live at Woodstock, Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight, Winterland, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience box set.

Club career Born to Serbian parents in Ljubljana, Aƒçimoviƒç started his career in the youth ranks of ≈Ωelezniƒçar Ljubljana. He made four first division appearances for ≈Ωelezniƒçar when he was 18 years old. From 1996 until 1998 he scored seven league goals in 36 matches for Olimpija. He then joined Red Star Belgrade, where he played for four and a half years. After successful appearances for the Slovenian national team in Euro 2000 and World Cup 2002, several bigger European clubs expressed interest in him. In the summer of 2002, he joined Tottenham Hotspur. In his first season in London, he made a few appearances, but never established himself as a first team player. In his second season, he became a fringe player. In January 2004 he joined the French club Lille on loan until the end of the season. When he arrived, the club was in 14th place in the Ligue 1, but Aƒçimoviƒç contributed to an eventual second-place finish, enough to qualify for the Champions League. Also, in his first year at Lille, he was part of the team's UEFA Cup campaign, when Lille reached the last sixteen before being eliminated. The following year, he played in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, when Lille reached the group stages. Aƒçimoviƒç scored Lille's only goal of the campaign against Manchester United in Lille's 1-0 victory in Paris. After two-and one-half seasons in Lille, he fell out of favour and joined Al-Ittihad for the 2006‚Äì07 season. After failing to adapt to life in Saudi Arabia, he agreed on a mutual termination of the contract, subsequently moving back to Europe to join Austria Wien. On 15 September 2010, his ened his football career following a persistent right knee injury. Aƒçimoviƒç returned to Slovenia and was appointed the Director of football at Olimpija Ljubljana, in January 2011, where he stayed until September 2012 when he resigned his position, due to poor results of the team in the Slovenian PrvaLiga. International career He debuted for the Slovenia national team on 22 April 1998 in Murska Sobota against the Czech Republic. He gave many notable performances for the national team, including a spectacular goal scored from the middle of the field against Ukraine in the Euro 2000 play-off. He represented Slovenia at both Euro 2000 and World Cup 2002, scoring in their 1‚Äì3 defeat to Paraguay in Seogwipo. His final appearance for the national side came on 28 March 2007 in Celje, during a 1‚Äì0 home defeat to the Netherlands in a Euro 2008 qualification match.

It provides care and treatment in conditions of high security for around 140 patients from Scotland and Northern Ireland. The hospital is managed by the State Hospitals Board for Scotland which is a public body accountable to the First Minister of Scotland through the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates. It is a Special Health Board, part of the NHS Scotland and the only hospital of its kind within Scotland. History Carstairs Hospital was constructed between 1936 and 1939. Although it was planned and financed as a facility for \\"mental defectives\\", it was first used as a military hospital, during the Second World War. The War Office relinquished control of the hospital in 1948, when it became the State Institution for Mental Defectives. On 1 October 1957 there was a large transfer of 90 criminally insane prisoners from the criminal lunatic department at HM Prison Perth to Carstairs, and this new combined unit became the State Mental Hospital. In 1994 the State Hospitals (Scotland) Act 1994 enabled management of the hospital to be transferred from the Secretary of State for Scotland to NHS Scotland, coming under the control of the State Hospitals Board for Scotland. A redevelopment of the hospital was approved by The Scottish Government in September 2007. Construction began in April 2008 and the new hospital facilities were officially opened on 26 June 2012. Security The hospital has an alarm system that is activated if any patient escapes to alert people in the vicinity, including those in the neighbouring town of Lanark, and local villages such as Ravenstruther. The system is tested on the third Thursday of every month at 1300hrs when the all clear siren sounds. One infamous incident of a break out happened in 1976, when two patients, Thomas McCulloch and Robert Mone, murdered a nurse, a patient and a police officer with axes in an escape attempt.Carstairs State Mental Hospital Incident ‚Äì Hansard, 1 December 1976 Controversies *In August 1999, a convicted killer walked free from Carstairs after his lawyers exploited a legal loophole. Noel Ruddle, who served seven years for shooting his next door neighbour with a semi-automatic Kalashnikov type rifle in 1991, was given an absolute discharge by a sheriff because his mental illness was deemed untreatable. He admitted that he had not been cured and had also boasted about beating the system.\\"Released killer says: 'I'm not cured'\\". BBC News. 5 August 1999 A year after his release, Ruddle escaped a prison sentence for threatening to kill a priest.\\"Ruddle escapes jail over death threat\\".

Entanglement witnesses can be linear or nonlinear functionals of the density matrix. If linear, then they can also be viewed as observables for which the expectation value of the entangled state is strictly outside the range of possible expectation values of any separable state.  Details  Let a composite quantum system have state space H_A \\\\otimes H_B. A mixed state œÅ is then a trace-class positive operator on the state space which has trace 1. We can view the family of states as a subset of the real Banach space generated by the Hermitian trace-class operators, with the trace norm. A mixed state œÅ is separable if it can be approximated, in the trace norm, by states of the form :\\\\xi = \\\\sum_{i=1} ^k p_i \\\\, \\\\rho_i^A \\\\otimes \\\\rho_i^B, where \\\\rho_i^A's and \\\\rho_i^B's are pure states on the subsystems A and B respectively. So the family of separable states is the closed convex hull of pure product states. We will make use of the following variant of Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem: Theorem Let S_1 and S_2 be disjoint convex closed sets in a real Banach space and one of them is compact, then there exists a bounded functional f separating the two sets. This is a generalization of the fact that, in real Euclidean space, given a convex set and a point outside, there always exists an affine subspace separating the two. The affine subspace manifests itself as the functional f. In the present context, the family of separable states is a convex set in the space of trace class operators. If œÅ is an entangled state (thus lying outside the convex set), then by theorem above, there is a functional f separating œÅ from the separable states. It is this functional f, or its identification as an operator, that we call an entanglement witness. There is more than one hyperplane separating a closed convex set from a point lying outside of it, so for an entangled state there is more than one entanglement witness. Recall the fact that the dual space of the Banach space of trace-class operators is isomorphic to the set of bounded operators. Therefore, we can identify f with a Hermitian operator A. Therefore, modulo a few details, we have shown the existence of an entanglement witness given an entangled state: Theorem For every entangled state œÅ, there exists a Hermitian operator A such that \\\\operatorname{Tr}(A \\\\, \\\\rho) < 0 , and \\\\operatorname{Tr}(A \\\\, \\\\sigma) \\\\geq 0 for all separable states œÉ. When both H_A and H_B have finite dimension, there is no difference between trace-class and Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators. So in that case A can be given by Riesz representation theorem. As an immediate corollary, we have: Theorem A mixed state œÉ is separable if and only if :\\\\operatorname{Tr}(A \\\\, \\\\sigma) \\\\geq 0 for any bounded operator A satisfying \\\\operatorname{Tr}(A \\\\cdot P \\\\otimes Q) \\\\geq 0, for all product pure state P \\\\otimes Q. If a state is separable, clearly the desired implication from the theorem must hold. On the other hand, given an entangled state, one of its entanglement witnesses will violate the given condition. Thus if a bounded functional f of the trace-class Banach space and f is positive on the product pure states, then f, or its identification as a Hermitian operator, is an entanglement witness. Such a f indicates the entanglement of some state. Using the isomorphism between entanglement witnesses and non-completely positive maps, it was shown (by the Horodecki's) that Theorem A mixed state \\\\sigma \\\\in L(H_A) \\\\otimes L(H_B) is separable if for every positive map Œõ from bounded operators on H_B to bounded operators on H_A, the operator (I_A \\\\otimes \\\\Lambda)(\\\\sigma) is positive, where I_A is the identity map on \\\\; L (H_A), the bounded operators on H_A.

In a book from 1893 that documents his work, Bishop states: \\"I procured an organ, and experimented by building an attachment to the keys, which would play with different colored lights to correspond with the music of the instrument.\\" Between 1919 and 1927, Mary Hallock-Greenewalt, a piano soloist, created a new technological art form called Nourathar, which means \\"essence of light\\" in Arabic. Her light music consisted of environmental color fields that produced a scale of light intensities and color. \\"In place of a keyboard, the Sarabet had a console with graduated sliders and other controls, more like a modern mixing board. Lights could be adjusted directly via the sliders, through the use of a pedal, and with toggle switches that worked like individual keys.\\" In clubs and private events in the 1960s \\"people used liquid-slides, disco balls and light projections on smoke to give the audience new sensations. Some of these experiments were linked to the music, but most of the time they functioned as decorations.\\"Dekker (2006) These came to be known as liquid light shows. From 1965 to 1966 in San Francisco, the visual shows by artist collectives such as The Joshua Light Show and the Brotherhood of Light accompanied The Grateful Dead concerts, which were inspired by the Beat generation‚Äîin particular the Merry Pranksters‚Äîand fueled by the \\"expansion of consciousness\\" from the Acid Tests. The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, between 1966 and 1967, organized by Andy Warhol contributed to the fusion of music and visuals in a party context. \\"The Exploding Party project examined the history of the party as an experimental artistic format, focusing in particular on music visualization - also in live contexts\\" Lund (2009) =1970s= Important events During the late 1970s video and music performance became more tightly integrated. At concerts, a few bands started to have regular film/video along with their music. Experimental film maker Tony Potts was considered an unofficial member of The Monochrome Set for his work on lighting design and film making for projections for live shows. Test Department initially worked with \\"Bert\\" Turnball as their resident visual artist, creating slideshows and film for live performances.credited on Beating The Retreat, Some Bizzare Records, 1984 The organization, Ministry of Power included collaborations with performance groups, traditional choirs and various political activists. Industrial bands would perform in art contexts, as well as in concert halls, and often with video projections. Groups like Cabaret Voltaire started to use low cost video editing equipment to create their own time-based collages for their sound works. In their words, \\"before [the use of video], you had to do collages on paper, but now you present them in rhythm‚Äîliving time‚Äîin video.\\" The film collages made by and for groups such as the Test Dept, Throbbing Gristle and San Francisco's Tuxedomoon became part of their live shows. An example of mixing film with live performance is that of Public Image Ltd. at the Ritz Riot in 1981. This club, located on the East 9th St in New York, had a state of the art video projection system. It was used to show a combination of prerecorded and live video on the club's screen. PiL played behind this screen with lights rear projecting their shadows on to the screen. Expecting a more traditional rock show, the audience reacted by pelting the projection screen with beer bottles and eventually pulling down the screen. Technological developments An artist retreat in Owego New York called Experimental Television Center, founded in 1971, made contributions to the development of many artists by gathering the experimental hardware created by video art pioneers: Nam June Paik, Steve Rutt and Bill Etra, and made the equipment available to artists in an inviting setting for free experimentation. Many of the outcomes debuted at the nightclub Hurrah which quickly became a new alternative for video artists who could not get their avant garde productions aired on regular broadcast outlets. Similarly, music video development was happening in other major cities around the world, providing an alternative to mainstream television.

At this time, music video clips did not exist in large quantity and the video installation was used to present an occasional film. To bring the role of visuals to an equal level with the DJ's music, Merrill made a large body of ambient visuals that could be combined in real time to interpret the music. Working alongside the DJ, this collection of raw visuals was mixed in real time to create a non-stop visual interpretation of the music. Merrill became the world's first full-time VJ. MTV founders came to this club and Merrill introduced them to the term and the role of \\"VJ\\",inspiring them to have VJ hosts on their channel the following year. Merrill collaborated with many musicians at the club, notably with electronic musician Richard Bone to make the first ambient music video album titled \\"Emerging Video\\". Thanks to a grant from the Experimental Television Center, her blend of video and 16 mm film bore the influential mark of the unique Rutt Etra and Paik synthesizers. This film was offered on VHS through \\"High Times Magazine\\" and was featured in the club programming. Her next foray into the home video audience was in collaboration with the newly formed arm of Sony, Sony HOME VIDEO, where she introduced the concept of \\"breaking music on video\\" with her series DANSPAK. With a few exceptions like the Jim Carrol Band with Lou Reed and Man Parrish, this series featured unknown bands, many of them unsigned. The rise of electronic music (especially in house and techno genres) and DJ club culture provided more opportunities for artists to create live visuals at events. The popularity of MTV lead to greater and better production of music videos for both broadcast and VHS, and many clubs began to show music videos as part of entertainment and atmosphere. Joe Shannahan (owner of Metro in 1989-1990) was paying artists for video content on VHS. Part of the evening they would play MTV music videos and part of the evening they would run mixes from local artists Shanahan had commissioned.Interview with Brien Rullman aka VJ Tek of OVT. 10 May 2010 Medusa's (an all-ages bar in Chicago) incorporated visuals as part of their nightly art performances throughout the early to mid 80s (1983‚Äì85).Medusa Chicago Also in Chicago during the mid-80s was Smart Bar, where Metro held \\"Video Metro\\" every Saturday night.Metro  Chicago Technological developments In the 1980s the development of relatively cheap transistor and integrated circuit technology allowed the development of digital video effects hardware at a price within reach of individual VJs and nightclub owners. One of the first commercially distributed video synthesizers available in 1981 was the CEL Electronics Chromascope sold for use in the developing nightclub scene.Chromascope Video Synthesizer - eyetrap.net VJ network The Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI), first produced in 1983, was revolutionary in this area, allowing complex digital effects to be applied in real time to video sources. The CVI became popular amongst television and music video producers and features in a number of music videos from the period. The Commodore Amiga introduced in 1985 made a breakthrough in accessibility for home computers and developed the first computer animation programs for 2D and 3D animation that could produce broadcast results on a desktop computer. =1990s= Important events A number of recorded works begin to be published in the 1990s to further distribute the work of VJs, such as the Xmix compilations (beginning in 1993), Future Sound of London's \\"Lifeforms\\"(VHS, 1994), Emergency Broadcast Network's \\"Telecommunication Breakdown\\" (VHS, 1995), Coldcut and Hexstatic's \\"Timber\\" (VHS, 1997 and then later on CDRom including a copy of VJamm VJ software), the \\"Mego Videos\\" compilation of works from 1996-1998 (VHS/PAL, 1999) and Addictive TV's 1998 television series \\"Transambient\\" for the UK's Channel 4 (and DVD release). In the United States, the emergence of the rave scene is perhaps to be credited for the shift of the VJ scene from nightclubs into underground parties. From around 1991 until 1994, Mark Zero would do film loops at Chicago raves and house parties.Interview with Brien Rullman of OVT. One of the earliest large-scaleInterview with OVT. Chicago raves was \\"Massive New Years Eve Revolution\\" in 1993, produced by Milwaukee's Drop Bass Network. It was a notable event as it featured the Optique Vid Tek (OVT) VJs on the bill. This event was followed by Psychosis, held on 3 April 1993, and headlined by Psychic TV, with visuals by OVT Visuals. In San Francisco Dimension 7 were a VJ collective working the early West Coast rave scene beginning in 1993. Between 1996 and 1998, Dimension 7 took projectors and lasers to the Burningman festival, creating immersive video installations on the Black Rock desert. In the UK groups such as The Light Surgeons and Eikon were transforming clubs and rave events by combining the old techniques of liquid lightshows with layers of slide, film and video projections. In Bristol, Children of Technology emerged, pioneering interactive immersive environments stemming from co-founder Mike Godfrey's architectural thesis whilst at university during the 1980s. Children of Technology integrated their homegrown CGI animation and video texture library with output from the interactive Virtual Light Machine (VLM), the brainchild of Jeff Minter and Dave Japp, with output onto over 500 sq m of layered screens using high power video and laser projection within a dedicated lightshow. Their \\"Ambient Theatre Lightshow\\" first emerged at Glastonbury 93 and they also provided VJ visuals for the Shamen, who had just released their no 1. hit \\"Ebeneezer Goode\\" at the festival. Invited musicians jammed in the Ambient Theatre Lightshow, using the VLM, within a prototype immersive environment. Children of Technology took interactive video concepts into a wide range of projects including show production for \\"Obsession\\" raves between 1993 and 1995, theatre, clubs, advertising, major stage shows and TV events. This included pioneering projects with 3D video / sound recording and performance, and major architectural projects in the late 1990s, where many media technology ideas were now taking hold. Another collective, \\"Hex\\" were working across a wide range of media - from computer games to art exhibitions - the group pioneered many new media hybrids, including live audiovisual jamming, computer-generated audio performances, and interactive collaborative instruments. This was the start of a trend which continues today with many VJs working beyond the club and dance party scene in areas such as installation art. The Japanese book \\"VJ2000\\" (Daizaburo Harada, 1999) marked one of the earliest publications dedicated to discussing the practices of VJs. Technological developments The combination of the emerging rave scene, along with slightly more affordable video technology for home-entertainment systems, brought consumer products to become more widely used in artistic production. However, costs for these new types of video equipment were still high enough to be prohibitive for many artists. There are three main factors that lead to the proliferation of the VJ scene in the 2000s: # affordable and faster laptops; # drop in prices of video projectors (especially after the dot-com bust where companies were loading off their goods on craigslist)Interview with Grant Davis aka VJ Culture specifically about the San Francisco scene. # the emergence of strong rave scenes and the growth of club culture internationally As a result of these, the VJ scene saw an explosion of new artists and styles. These conditions also facilitated a sudden emergence of a less visible (but nonetheless strong) movement of artists who were creating algorithmic, generative visuals. The Videonics MX-1 video mixer This decade saw video technology shift from being strictly for professional film and television studios to being accessible for the prosumer market (e.g. the wedding industry, church presentations, low-budget films, and community television productions). These mixers were quickly adopted by VJs as the core component of their performance setups. This is similar to the release of the Technics 1200 turntables, which were marketed towards homeowners desiring a more advanced home entertainment system, but were then appropriated by musicians and music enthusiasts for experimentation. Initially, video mixers were used to mix pre-prepared video material from VHSplayers and live camera sources, and later to add the new computer software outputs into their mix. The 90s saw the development of a number of digital video mixers such as Panasonic's WJ- MX50, WJ-MX12, and the Videonics MX-1. Early desktop editing systems such as the NewTek Video Toaster for the Amiga computer were quickly put to use by VJs seeking to create visuals for the emerging rave scene, whilst software developers began to develop systems specifically designed for live visuals such as O'Wonder's \\"Bitbopper\\". The first known software for VJs was Vujak - created in 1992 and written for the Mac by artist Brian Kane for use by the video art group he was part of - Emergency Broadcast Network, though it was not used in live performances. EBN used the EBN VideoSampler v2.3, developed by Mark Marinello and Greg Deocampo. In the UK, Bristol's Children of Technology developed a dedicated immersive video lightshow using the Virtual Light Machine (VLM) called AVLS or Audio-Visual-Live-System during 1992 and 1993. The VLM was a custom built PC by video engineer Dave Japp using super- rare transputer chips and modified motherboards, programmed by Jeff Minter (Llamasoft & Virtual Light Co.). The VLM developed after Jeff's earlier Llamasoft Light Synthesiser programme. With VLM, DI's from live musicians or DJ's activated Jeff's algorithmic real-time video patterns, and this was real- time mixed using pansonic video mixers with CGI animation/VHS custom texture library and live camera video feedback. Children of Technology developed their own \\"Video Light\\" system, using hi-power and low-power video projection to generate real-time 3D beam effects, simultaneous with enormous surface and mapped projection. The VLM was used by the Shamen, The Orb, Primal Scream, Obsession, Peter Gabriel, Prince and many others between 1993 and 1996. A software version of the VLM was integrated into Atari's Jaguar console, in response to growing VJ interest. In the mid-90s, Audio reactive pure synthesis (as opposed to clip-based) software such as Cthugha and Bomb were influential. By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing softwares available, including generative visuals programs such as MooNSTER, Aestesis, and Advanced Visualization Studio, as well as video clip players such as FLxER, created by Gianluca Del Gobbo, and VJamm. Programming environments such as Max/MSP, Macromedia Director and later Quartz Composer started to become used by themselves and also to create VJing programs like VDMX or pixmix. These new software products and the dramatic increases in computer processing power over the decade meant that VJs were now regularly taking computers to gigs. =2000s= Important events Two VJs collaborating on a mix at an outdoor electronic music festival. The new century has brought new dynamics to the practice of visual performance. To be a VJ previously had largely meant a process of self-invention in isolation from others: the term was not widely known. Then through the rise of internet adoption, having access to other practitioners very became the norm, and virtual communities quickly formed. The sense of collective then translated from the virtual world onto physical spaces. This becomes apparent through the numerous festivals that emerge all over Europe with strong focus on VJing. =VJ events in Europe= The VideA festival in Barcelona ran from 2000 - 2005.,\\"VideA was the first festival in Spain and perhaps to Europe to dedicate itself to the VJ's art.\\" - AVIT, clear in its inception as the online community of VJCentral.com self- organising a physical presence, had its first festival in Leeds (2002),Eskandar, p.181 followed by Chicago (2003), Brighton (2003), San Francisco (2004), and Birmingham (2005), 320x240 in Croatia (2003), Contact Europe in Berlin (2003). Also, the Cimatics festival in Brussels should be credited as a pioneering event, with a first festival edition in 2002 completely dedicated to VJing. In 2003, the Finnish media arts festival PixelAche was dedicated to the topic of VJing, while in 2003, Berlin's Chaos Computer Club started a collaboration with AVIT organisers that featured VJ Camps and Congress strands. LPM - Live Performers Meeting was born in Rome in 2004, with the aim to offer a real meeting space for often individually working artists, a place to meet the fellow VJ artists, spin-off new projects, and share all VJing related experiences, softwares, questions and insights. LPM since has become one of the leading international meetings dedicated to artists, professionals and enthusiasts of VJing, visual and live video performance, counting its 20th edition in 2019. Also around this time (in 2005 and 2007), UK artists Addictive TV teamed up with the British Film Institute to produce Optronica, a crossover event showcasing audiovisual performances at the London IMAX cinema and BFI Southbank. Two festivals entirely dedicated to VJing, Mapping Festival in Geneva and Vision'R in Paris, held their first edition in 2005. As these festivals emerged that prominently featured VJs as headline acts (or the entire focus of the festival), the rave festival scene also began to regularly include VJs in their main stage lineups with varying degrees of prominence. =VJ events beyond Europe= The MUTEK festival (2000‚Äìpresent) in Montr√©al regularly featured VJs alongside experimental sound art performances, and later the Elektra Festival (2008‚Äìpresent) also emerged in Montr√©al and featured many VJ performances. In Perth, Australia, the Byte Me! festival (2007) showed the work of many VJs from the Pacific Rim area alongside new media theorists and design practitioners. With lesser funding, the US scene has been host to more workshops and salons than festivals. Between 2000‚Äì2006, Grant Davis (VJ Culture) and Jon Schwark of Dimension 7 produced \\"Video Salon\\", a regular monthly gathering significant in helping establish and educate a strong VJ community in San Francisco, and attended by VJs across California and the United States.Eskandar, pp. 174‚Äì175 In addition, they produced an annual \\"Video RIOT!\\" (2003‚Äì2005) as a political statement following the R.A.V.E. Act (Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act) of 2003; a display of dissatisfaction by the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004; and in defiance of a San Francisco city ordinance limiting public gatherings in 2005. Several VJ battles and competitions began to emerge during this time period, such as Video Salon's \\"SIGGRAPH VJ Battle\\" in San Diego (2003), Videocake's \\"AV Deathmatch\\" series in Toronto (2006) and the \\"VJ Contests\\" at the Mapping Festival in Geneva (2009). These worked much like a traditional DJ battle where VJs would be given a set amount of time to show off their best mixes and were judged according to several criteria by a panel of judges. =Publications= Databases of visual content and promotional documentation became available on DVD formats and online through personal websites and through large databases, such as the \\"Prelinger Archives\\" on Archive.org. Many VJs began releasing digital video loop sets on various websites under Public Domain or Creative Commons licensing for other VJs to use in their mixes, such as Tom Bassford's \\"Design of Signage\\" collection (2006), Analog Recycling's \\"79 VJ Loops\\" (2006), VJzoo's \\"Vintage Fairlight Clips\\" (2007) and Mo Selle's \\"57 V.2\\" (2007). Promotional and content-based DVDs began to emerge, such as the works from the UK's ITV1 television series Mixmasters (2000‚Äì2005) produced by Addictive TV, Lightrhythm Visuals (2003), Visomat Inc. (2002), and Pixdisc, all of which focused on the visual creators, VJ styles and techniques. These were then later followed by NOTV, Atmospherix, and other labels. Mia Makela curated a DVD collection for Mediateca of Caixa Forum called \\"LIVE CINEMA\\" in 2007, focusing on the emerging sister practice of \\"live cinema\\". Individual VJs and collectives also published DVDs and CD- ROMs of their work, including Eclectic Method's bootleg video mix (2002) and Eclectic Method's \\"We're Not VJs\\" (2005), as well as eyewash's \\"DVD2\\" (2004) and their \\"DVD3\\" (2008). Books reflecting on the history, technical aspects, and theoretical issues began to appear, such as \\"The VJ Book: Inspirations and Practical Advice for Live Visuals Performance\\" (Paul Spinrad, 2005), \\"VJ: Audio-Visual Art and VJ Culture\\" (Michael Faulkner and D-Fuse, 2006), \\"vE-jA: Art + Technology of Live Audio-Video\\" (X√°rene Eskandar [ed], 2006), and \\"VJ: Live Cinema Unraveled\\" (Tim Jaeger, 2006). The subject of VJ-DJ collaboration also started to become a subject of interest for those studying in the field of academic human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI). Technological developments The availability and affordability of new consumer-level technology allowed many more people to get involved into VJing. The dramatic increase in computer processing power that became available facilitated more compact, yet often more complex setups, sometimes allowing VJs to bypass using a video mixer, using powerful computers running VJ software to control their mixing instead. However, many VJs continue to use video mixers with multiple sources, which allows flexibility for a wide range of input devices and a level of security against computer crashes or slowdowns in video playback due to overloading the CPU of computers due to the demanding nature of realtime video processing. VJing with vvvv. Today's VJs have a wide choice of off the shelf hardware products, covering every aspect of visuals performance, including video sample playback (Korg Kaptivator), real-time video effects (Korg Entrancer) and 3D visual generation. The widespread use of DVDs gave initiative for scratchable DVD players. Many new models of MIDI controllers became available during the 2000s, which allow VJs to use controllers based on physical knobs, dials, and sliders, rather than interact primarily with the mouse/keyboard computer interface. There are also many VJs working with experimental approaches to working with live video. Open source graphical programming environments (such as Pure Data) are often used to create custom software interfaces for performances, or to connect experimental devices to their computer for processing live data (for example, the IBVA EEG-reading brainwave unit, the Arduino microprocessor, or circuit bending children's toys). Guerilla VJ bike - setup for DIY outdoor projection. The second half of this decade also saw a dramatic increase in display configurations being deployed, including widescreen canvases, multiple projections and video mapped onto the architectural form. This shift has been underlined by the transition from broadcast based technology - fixed until this decade firmly in the 4x3 aspect ratio specifications NTSC and PAL - to computer industry technology, where the varied needs of office presentation, immersive gaming and corporate video presentation have led to diversity and abundance in methods of output. Compared to the ~640x480i fixed format of NTSC/PAL, a contemporary laptop using DVI can output a great variety of resolutions up to ~2500px wide, and in conjunction with the Matrox TripleHead2Go can feed three different displays with an image coordinated across them all. Common technical setups A significant aspect of VJing is the use of technology, be it the re- appropriation of existing technologies meant for other fields, or the creation of new and specific ones for the purpose of live performance. The advent of video is a defining moment for the formation of the VJ (video jockey). Often using a video mixer, VJs blend and superimpose various video sources into a live motion composition. In recent years, electronic musical instrument makers have begun to make specialty equipment for VJing. Customized VDMX Interface LED wall display surrounding DJ on stage VJing developed initially by performers using video hardware such as videocameras, video decks and monitors to transmit improvised performances with live input from cameras and even broadcast TV mixed with pre-recorded elements. This tradition lives on with many VJs using a wide range of hardware and software available commercially or custom made for and by the VJs. VJ hardware can be split into categories - *Source hardware generates a video picture which can be manipulated by the VJ, e.g. video cameras and Video Synthesizers. *Playback hardware plays back an existing video stream from disk or tape-based storage mediums, e.g. VHS tape players and DVD players. *Mixing hardware allows the combining of multiple streams of video e.g. a Video Mixer or a computer utilizing VJ software. *Effects hardware allows the adding of special effects to the video stream, e.g. Colour Correction units *Output hardware is for displaying the video signal, e.g. Video projector, LED display, or Plasma Screen. There are many types of software a VJ may use in their work, traditional NLE production tools such as Adobe Premiere, After Effects, and Apple's Final Cut Pro are used to create content for VJ shows. Specialist performance software is used by VJs to play back and manipulate video in real-time. VJ performance software is highly diverse, and include software which allows a computer to replace the role of an analog video mixer and output video across extended canvasses composed of multiple screens or projectors. Small companies producing dedicated VJ software such as Modul8 and Magic give VJs a sophisticated interface for real- time processing of multiple layers of video clips combined with live camera inputs, giving VJs a complete off the shelf solution so they can simply load in the content and perform. Some popular titles which emerged during the 2000s include Resolume, NuVJ. Some VJs prefer to develop software themselves specifically to suit their own performance style. Graphical programming environments such as Max/MSP/Jitter, Isadora, and Pure Data have developed to facilitate rapid development of such custom software without needing years of coding experience. =Sample workflows= There are many types of configurations of hardware and software that a VJ may use to perform. Research and reflective thinking Several research projects have been dedicated to the documentation and study of VJing from the reflective and theoretical point of view. Round tables, talks, presentations and discussions are part of festivals and conferences related to new media art, such as ISEA and Ars Electronica for example, as well as specifically related to VJing, as is the case of the Mapping Festival. Exchange of ideas through dialogue contributed to the shift of the discussion from issues related to the practicalities of production to more complex ideas and to the process and the concept. Subjects related to VJing are, but not exclusively: identity and persona (individual and collective), the moment as art, audience participation, authorship, networks, collaboration and narrative. Through collaborative projects, visual live performance shift to a field of interdisciplinary practices. Periodical publications, online and printed, launched special issues on VJing. This is the case of AMinima printed magazine, with a special issue on Live Cinema (which features works by VJs), and Vague Terrain (an online new media journal), with the issue The Rise of the VJ.

His paternal grandfather, Alonzo Barton Hepburn, was a founder of Chase National Bank and Comptroller of the Currency under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland. Career He was spotted as a stage actor in Los Angeles by the screen director Cecil B. DeMille. He starred in a 1929 production, Painted Faces, an early film with sound. This didn't result in huge success for Hepburn and he returned to the theatre, with a number of appearances on Broadway, until the 1940s when he appeared in a number of films, such as Hi Diddle Diddle (1943), The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1944), and A Song for Miss Julie (1945).

It was introduced alongside the Centris 660AV, the \\"AV\\" after both model numbers signifying video input and output capabilities, as well as enhanced audio. The 840AV has the same mini tower form factor as the Quadra 800, with a faster Motorola 68040 processor. The Quadra 840AV was discontinued shortly after the introduction of the PowerPC-based Power Macintosh. The Power Macintosh 8100/80AV provided the same functionality in the same form factor, albeit at a significantly higher price point, while the 7100/66AV was priced comparably to the 840AV but in a IIvx-style desktop case.  Hardware  At the time of introduction, its 40 MHz Motorola 68040 CPU and interleaved RAM made it the fastest Macintosh available, topping both the nominally higher-end Quadra 950 and the Quadra 800 by 7 MHz. It remains both the fastest Quadra and the fastest 68k Macintosh of all time, since all later high-end Macintoshes were PowerPC-based Power Macintoshes. The 840AV is also the only Mac to use the 40 MHz-clocked 68040. It also sports a faster 66.7 MHz AT&T; DSP 3210 Digital Signal Processor chip, compared with the 55 MHz variant in the 660AV. The on- board DSP was primarily intended to speed up audio/video processing, although few Mac programs made use of this due to the complexity of programming it. The 840AV and its relative, the Centris/Quadra 660AV, marked a number of firsts for the Macintosh family. They were the first Macintoshes to include on-board 16-bit 48 kHz stereo audio playback and recording capability, as well as S-Video and composite video input and output. To improve video playback, two separate frame buffers were used: one for standard graphics, and one specifically for video. This enabled the live video input to be displayed as a scalable \\"window\\" within the Macintosh user interface. They were also the first personal computers that supported speech recognition (PlainTalk) out-of- the-box. The Apple GeoPort Telecom Adapter Kit introduced with the AV Macs added many DSP-based telecommunication functions, such as modem, fax, and telephony. The Quadra 840AV came in a similar case to the earlier Macintosh Quadra 800; the housing, chassis, power supply, and internal storage assemblies are the same, but the front and rear panels changed, with the power button being moved to the back. Internally, the 840AV is significantly different. Apart from the faster processor, the logic board lacks the 800's Processor Direct Slot and second ADB port, but has a DAV slot (in line with NuBus slot A) and the new GeoPort. Also, unlike the 800's 8 MiB of fixed RAM, all of the 840AV's memory is in SIMMs (this is the reason why the minimum amount of memory is lower). The way in which the 840AV deals with its memory (DRAM) differs from the other machines of its generation (Quadra 700, 800, 950) in that 4, 8, 16, or 32 MB 72-pin 60ns SIMMs may be installed up to 128 MB and sizes can be mixed. However, the Quadra 840AV does not support 1 MB, 2 MB, or 64 MB SIMMs. The 840AV and 660AV are the first Macintosh computers to operate in 32-bit mode at all times, and cannot be toggled back to 24-bit mode, which may be useful for using early Nubus cards that conform to the 24-bit addressing.  Trivia  thumb Macintosh Quadra 840AV with Macintosh 16\\" Color Display (M1298), AppleDesign Powered Speakers (M6082), Apple Extended Keyboard II (M3501) and Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II (M2706) Macintosh Quadra 840AV logic board The new AV machines were some of the first to ship standard with an internal CD-ROM drive (earlier Quadra and Centris models were available with the built-in CD-ROM drive as optional extras). The operating system installation package came on CD-ROM rather than a series of floppy disks whenever the CD-ROM drive was included. A hidden QuickTime video included on the original Quadra 840AV/Centris 660AV \\"Install Me First\\" CD-ROM, shows the jubilant Cyclone / Tempest design team in the midst of celebrating their accomplishment. In this video, a Cyclone (840AV) prototype logic board is shown. The logic board is fitted with a 25 MHz 68040, a number of rework wires, and most conspicuously, a daughter card nicknamed \\"Karma\\", on which the audio and video input/output ports are located. Notably, the audio and video ports on the card are front-facing, positioned as though they would protrude from an opening in the lower front of the case, where they are more easily accessible to the user. According to a member of the team, the \\"AV on a card\\" feature was omitted, because there was not enough room for it in the case. Coinciding with the introduction of both AV Macs, Apple introduced the Apple AudioVision 14 Display, featuring easily accessible audio input, audio output and video input ports of its own, which could be fed by an ADC adapter cable connected with the rear AV ports of the AV Macs. The later Power Macintosh 6100, 7100, and 8100 returned to the \\"AV on a card\\" concept, which was later abandoned with the 7500/8500 series machines, and then re-introduced with the \\"Wings\\" AV \\"personality card\\" of the Power Macintosh G3 \\"Gossamer\\" / \\"Artemis\\" machines. Stored inside spare ROM space are two JPEG images of the Quadra 840AV development team. Early Quadra 840AV logic boards featured a 2 MB ROM SIMM slot located below the RAM SIMM slots. It was originally planned that the 840AV ROM would contain a bootable image of System 7 within a larger 4 MB ROM space (code-named SuperMario), but Apple dropped this idea before the 840AV shipped. Later revisions of the 840AV logic board included all 2 MB of ROM soldered onto the logic board.

Late in life Ibn Ezra was compelled to seek refuge in Constantinople, where he was called to the rabbinate of Sofia, and where he would die. Writings Ibn Ezra was a learned Talmudist, and his works were highly esteemed.

The film was a belated entry to the series, following 1978's Carry On Emmannuelle. It was produced to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas (two other more serious films on the subject, 1492: Conquest of Paradise and Christopher Columbus: The Discovery came out the same year). Plotline Christopher Columbus (Jim Dale) believes he can find an alternative route to the far East and persuades the King (Leslie Phillips) and Queen of Spain (June Whitfield) to finance his expedition. But the Sultan of Turkey (Rik Mayall), who makes a great deal of money through taxing the merchants who have to pass through his country on the current route, sends his best spy, Fatima (Sara Crowe), to wreck the trip... Casting Main series regulars present are Jim Dale (in his eleventh Carry On), Peter Gilmore (also in his eleventh), Bernard Cribbins (in his third), Leslie Phillips (in his fourth), Jon Pertwee (in his fourth) and June Whitfield (also in her fourth). The only actor to bridge the gap between Carry On Columbus and the previous entry was Jack Douglas, making his eighth appearance in the series. Original Carry On performer Frankie Howerd was signed up to appear, but he died shortly before he was due to film his role. His part as the King of Spain was offered to original series regular Bernard Bresslaw, who turned it down. Leslie Phillips eventually took on the role, playing opposite June Whitfield as the Queen, a role turned down by both Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor. Veteran Carry On performer Kenneth Connor was offered a cameo role in the film but he turned it down, saying \\"I want to be remembered as a Carry On star, not a Carry On bit-player\\". The producers managed to persuade a number of alternative comedians such as Peter Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall, Julian Clary and Nigel Planer (all of whom except Clary are from The Comic Strip) to appear in the film.

The Irish Times, 2 October 1992, (p.13). However, Carry On Columbus took more money at the UK box office than the two other Columbus films released in 1992, Christopher Columbus: The Discovery and 1492: Conquest of Paradise, although all three films flopped. Carry On Columbus was also shot on a much lower budget than the other two films, a budget of ¬£2.5 million compared to the other two budgets of $45 million and $47 million respectively.

History  Moldovan schools were first established in Transnistria after the 1924 formation of the Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was part of the Soviet Republic of Ukraine. In 1940 the former Moldovan Autonomous Republic was split, 8 districts were included in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine and 6 districts were joined with part of Basarabia in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldavia. In the Ukrainian part of the former Moldavian autonomy Moldovan schools were transformed into Russian-language schools, but in the 6 districts that remained part of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova a Moldovan-language network of schools was kept. Post 1992 situation The Moldovan 1989 language law, that introduced the Latin script as the official script of the Republic of Moldova, was boycotted by the Transnistrian authorities, and all Moldovan schools in Transnistria were ordered to keep the Cyrillic script. After the War of Transnistria ended in mid-1992, the local schools became regulated by the government of Transnistria. The schools that chose to use the Latin script back in 1989 came under pressure of the authorities and most were forced to return to the Cyrillic script. Only six Romanian language schools in Transnistria were allowed to keep the Latin script. Attempts to expand the number of schools which are using Latin script are met with heavy-handed repression. In 1996, the director of the only Moldovan school in Slobozia, who supported the wish of the parents to conduct education in Latin alphabet was fired and forced to leave the region. In 1999 a lecturer of Moldovan language of the Bender Pedagogical College has been dismissed for promoting the Latin script in the institution. The dismissal has been preceded by threats on the phone and an aggression in the building where she lived.Non discrimination review under the stability pact for South Eastern Europe In September 1996, the Grigoriopol administration used Cossacks and police to stop the activity of Moldovan School.Interview with Eleonora Cecavski, teacher from Grigoriopol On 2 October 1996 three teachers were arrested and taken to Tiraspol. On 7 October 1996, as a result of a demarche by the President of the Republic of Moldova and the OSCE Mission, the teachers were released. Another attempt to teach Romanian clandestinely in Grigoriopol, in a ‚ÄòPMR state-funded school‚Äô, failed in 2002. Teaching staff and parents were blatantly vilified in the local press as ‚Äòenemies of the State‚Äô.BIG SCANDAL IN A SMALL TOWN, article in \\"Dnestrovsky Kurier\\" 8 March 2002 One by one they were invited to ‚Äòreconsider‚Äô, threatened with loss of employment and the corresponding entitlement to housing. Children (and teachers) were forced to write explanations as to why they used the Latin script and local officials routinely visited classes to check whether tuition was being ‚Äòproperly‚Äô conducted. The parent-teacher association was abolished and its head, Mihai Speian, was arrested.Unworthy partner: the schools issue as an example of human rights abuses in Transdniestria The Moldovan school in Grigoriopol was forced to move in Doro»õcaia, a village controlled by Chi»ôinƒÉu, and children commute 10‚Äì15 km daily to attend the school.  The 2004 crisis  In the summer of 2004, the Transnistrian authorities closed four of the six schools in the region that taught Moldovan language using the Latin script, known as Romanian. Some of the 3,400 enrolled children were affected by this measure and the teachers and parents who opposed the closures were temporarily arrested for up to six hours. During the crisis, the Moldovan government decided to create a blockade that would isolate the disputed region from the rest of the world. The blockade was ineffective because of a lack of cooperation from Ukraine, led at the time by Leonid Kuchma. Transnistria retaliated with a series of actions meant to destabilize the economic situation in Moldova, in particular, by cutting the power supply from the power plants that were built in Transnistria in Soviet times. As a result, this crisis generated power outages in parts of Moldova. A leading figure in the conflict was Elena Vasilievna Bomeshko, the Minister of Education for Transnistria. According to her, and official Transnistrian policy, the language is referred to as \\"Romanian\\" when it is taught in Latin script and referred to as \\"Moldovan\\" when Cyrillic script is used. Transnistria rejects accusations of anti-Romanian bias and defends its preference of Cyrillic for Moldovan as a way to maintain the original language, pointing to the fact as far back as the Middle Ages, Moldovan Bibles were always written in Cyrillic.Interview with V. Tulgar, Union of Moldovans (in Russian) While the Romanian language used the Cyrillic alphabet for centuries, it is no longer used in Romania. Cyrillic script is still used in some parts of Moldova, but only one newspaper (state-owned by Transnistrian authorities) prints a few hundred copies in Cyrillic.RGN Press report: No Romanian language textbooks available in Grigoriopol. (in Romanian) The closed Romanian schools were reopened, after registering as private institutions with the Transnistrian authorities. Pressure from the European Union (a travel ban was introduced to 10 Transnistrian education officials) may have sped up the process., pp. 17-18: \\"The Council adopted a Decision implementing common position 2004/179/CFSP on restrictive measures against the leadership of the Transnistrian region of Moldova (15061/05). [...] The Decision reduces the list of persons (from ten to two) affected by visa restrictions in order to take account of the improvements in the situation of Latin-script schools in some areas of the Transnistrian region. In August 2004, the Council expanded the scope of the restrictive measures to persons held responsible for the intimidation campaign and the closure of Latin-script Moldovan schools and established a new list of persons subject to the visa-ban.\\" but they still have the status of \\"private schools\\" and consequently do not receive funding from the Transnistrian government. Many teachers and parents of students studying at Moldovan schools with Cyrillic script had contacted the Moldovan Helsinki Committee for Human Rights asking support to turn education in Romanian (Latin script), as the studies based on the Cyrillic script and Soviet curricula don't have any perspective and the children are unable to pursue higher studies anywhere.Helsinki-Moldova Committee Says About 50 Schools in Transnistria Want to Study in Romanian The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities has condemned the actions of Transnistrian authorities as a \\"linguistic cleansing\\".OSCE: Linguistic cleansing underway in Transdniestria Current situation Students at Alexandru cel Bun High School in Bender celebrating the end of the academic year in May 2013 An OSCE report from June 2005 states: ‚ÄúIf they [Moldovan parents in Transnistria] enroll their children in one of this schools that offer a Moldovan curriculum using a Latin script, they risk being threatened by the regional security service, and seeing their jobs put in jeopardy. Sending their children in one of the 33 Transdniestrian schools they teach in their native language in Cyrillic is, however, hardly an appealing alternative, as the schools follow an out-dated curriculum and use textbooks from the Soviet period‚Äù.OSCE report: Moldovan schools in Transdniestria This is the reason why many Moldovans from Transnistria send their children in harassment-free Russian language schools. Transnistrian authorities don't recognize the diplomas issued by Moldovan schools using Latin script, making impossible for graduates of those schools to study on Transnistrian higher educational institutions.Transnistrian point of view about Moldovan schools =Involvement of European Court of Human Rights= In November 2006 the European Court of Human Rights accepted to examine the claims submitted by three Moldovan schools in Transnistria (from Tighina, R√Æbni»õa and Grigoriopol) regarding the violation of their right to education and right to work in conditions of non-discrimination. The three schools concerned regard Russia and Moldova as responsible for violation of their rights.ECHR TO CONSIDER CLAIMS LODGED BY MOLDOVAN SCHOOLS IN TRANSNISTRIA In June 2009, the Court conducted hearings on three similar cases: Caldare and 42 Others v.

In the collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Doepke Model Toys have delighted kids for decades and are now the envy of toy collectors everywhere. Based near Cincinnati, Ohio, Doepke (pron. \\"dep key\\") made several different types of toys ranging from model automobiles such as the MG, 1955 Jaguar, a fire engine, trains (big enough to ride on) and construction vehicles including bulldozers, graders, loaders, earth movers, and cranes. The toys are noted for their remarkable realism.Doepke Blog (http://doepke.wordpress.com/) Retrieved 6-17-11.McElwee, Neil and Lois, McElwee's #4 Guide to Doepke Model Toys, 1995.Deopke Yardbird Train Catalog, The Chas.

In 1950 production was moved to Rossmoyne, Ohio. Being so soon after the conclusion of World War II, many toys available at the time reflected a war theme. In contrast to this trend, the Doepkes were encouraged by their grandmother to create toys that were not war-related. Since both men had previously worked in the steel industry, they were quite aware of the possibilities and were adamant about creating exact duplicates of then modern construction equipment and cars.\\"About Doepke Toys\\" TNT Toy Trucks Web site (http://www.tnttoytrucks.com/Doepke.html) Retrieved 6-17-11. The popularity of Doepke toys among children in the 1950s was likely bolstered by their uncanny realism. Yet, this appeal was not necessarily limited to children.Doepke Toys Blog (http://www.doepketoy.com/?tag=doepke-unit-crane) Retrieved 6-17-11. On many occasions, salesmen would carry Doepke toys with them to help with sales. \\"In one instance a model made by Doepke actually worked out a production flaw in its much larger relative.\\" Said, the daughter of Charles Doepke in an interview. One of Doepke‚Äôs best selling items was its steel crane, first manufactured in 1949. It was one of the most popular pressed steel construction toys ever made. It was rugged enough to survive the rigors of outdoor use and had realistic details like rubber Goodyear tires. The toy had two functional hand crank hoists, accurate rigging, a stamped steel open lattice boom and a working clamshell bucket used for excavating. The toy was priced at $14.95.Atkinson, Wade, Two Feet from the Third Rail: Being a Compendium of Thoughts, Ideas, Advice, Castigations, and Memiors on 50 Years in Public Relations, 1994. In 1959, due to an increase in lower cost competitors and a rise in steel costs coupled with the company's inability to create the same realism with wood toys, Doepke was forced to shut down. Today, there are many collectors of Doepke toys and the models are routinely offered for sale in online forums such as EBay.

Before April 1994, Enfield Island Village formed part of the Epping Forest district of Essex, but it was transferred to the borough of Enfield in Greater London when the housing development was created.  History  Housing on the Island Enfield Island Village was built on land previously occupied by the Royal Small Arms Factory. It is close to the borders of Essex and Hertfordshire, and is adjacent to the River Lee Navigation, River Lea, Cattlegate Flood Relief Channel, and Newmans Weir, as well as open countryside, including Epping Forest. The site was decommissioned by the MOD in 1984 and was sold to British Aerospace (BAe). BAe together with Trafalgar House launched a joint venture company, Lee Valley Developments (LVD). In 1996, the land was sold to Fairview Homes, the housing wing of Hillsdown Holdings. The housing estate was built by Fairview New Homes between 1997 and 2003 on a brownfield site. It comprises a mixture of housing ranging from one-bedroom flats to five-bedroom houses. In line with national standards, 25% of the housing was designated as social housing, and some of the original buildings have been retained. The development has a central parkland area and a small shopping centre. The shops include a small supermarket, a pharmacy, and a Chinese takeaway. The Island also has its own general practitioner (GP), private fitness centre, and a new (2003) primary school ‚Äì Keys Meadow in nearby Enfield Lock. A new library opened in 2008. The development is on a flood plain. However, the Environment Agency's assessment is that even without the flood defences that surround the Island, there is even less risk of serious flooding (0.1%, or 1 in 1000 years) than in the surrounding area (0.5%, or 1 in 200 years). Riverside gardens The River Lea flows through the island As it is a private development, residents are responsible for many aspects of life on the Island through the Enfield Island Village Trust. The Trust is responsible for the upkeep of common land, including the ornamental canal and parkland, utilities such as the waste water system, and for enforcing legal covenants covering the development. There was a campaign against the development by Friends of the Earth and the Enfield Lock Action Group in the late 1990s. The campaign resulted in the Enfield RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) Review Panel being set up, informed by environmental reports carried out over ten years and including evidence from witnesses such as the Head of Land Quality at the Environment Agency and a team of environmental consultants. The review concluded that the site was safe for development and that campaigners' claims regarding rumours of dangerous materials were untrue. Planning permission was granted for the development, supported by the European Union and by the Enfield Enterprise Agency. It was developed as a model brown field development, with a clay cap at a depth of one metre under the topsoil. Safety inspections were initially carried out every six months, but this has now been reduced to annually.

He was part of the politically influential Hawes family. His brother, uncle, and cousin also served as U.S. Representatives, and his grandson Harry B. Hawes was a member of the United States Senate. Hawes began his political career as an ardent Whig and was a close friend of the party's founder, Henry Clay. When the party declined and dissolved in the 1850s, Hawes became a Democrat, and his relationship with Clay cooled. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Hawes was a supporter of Kentucky's doctrine of armed neutrality. When the Commonwealth's neutrality was breached in September 1861, Hawes fled to Virginia and enlisted as a brigade commissary under Confederate general Humphrey Marshall. When Kentucky's Confederate government was formed in Russellville, Hawes was offered the position of state auditor, but declined. Months later, he was selected to be Confederate governor of the Commonwealth following George W. Johnson's death at the Battle of Shiloh. Hawes and the Confederate government traveled with Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee, and when Bragg invaded Kentucky in October 1862, he captured Frankfort and held an inauguration ceremony for Hawes. The ceremony was interrupted, however, by forces under Union general Don Carlos Buell, and the Confederates were driven from the Commonwealth following the Battle of Perryville. Hawes relocated to Virginia, where he conducted a Confederate government in exile for Kentucky and continued to lobby President Jefferson Davis to attempt another invasion of the state. At the end of the war, the Confederate government of Kentucky in exile ceased to exist, and Hawes returned to his home in Paris, Kentucky. He swore an oath of allegiance to the Union, and was allowed to return to his law practice. He was elected county judge of Bourbon County, a post he held until his death in 1877. Early life Richard Hawes was born on February 6, 1797 near Bowling Green, Caroline County, Virginia. He was one of eleven children born to Richard and Clara Walker Hawes.\\"Richard Hawes in Powell, p. 115 The Haweses were a political family; Richard's brother, Albert Gallatin Hawes, nephew, Aylett Hawes, and cousin, Aylett Hawes Buckner, all served in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1810, the family moved to Kentucky, settling in Fayette County, near Lexington.\\"Hawes, Richard\\" in Kleber, pp. 418‚Äì419 Part of Hawes's early education was obtained through the Jessamine County school conducted by Samuel Wilson.Harrison in Register, p. 28 On November 13, 1818, Hawes married Hetty Morrison Nicholas of Lexington. He pursued classical studies at Transylvania University, then studied law under Robert C. Wickliffe. Hawes and Wickliffe became law partners upon the former's admission to the bar in 1818. Due to overcrowding of the bar in Lexington, Hawes moved to Winchester in 1824. While there, he became part owner of a rope and bagging factory with Benjamin H. Buckner. =Political career= Hawes began his political career in 1828 when he was elected as a Whig to represent Clark County, Kentucky in the Kentucky House of Representatives. As a member of the state militia, Hawes saw limited service in the Black Hawk War in 1832, and returned to his position in the Kentucky House in 1834.Harrison in Register, p. 29 He was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Representative in 1834, but was elected to represent Henry Clay's \\"Ashland District\\" three years later, serving from March 4, 1837 to March 3, 1841. He then moved to Paris, Kentucky in 1843 and continued the practice of law.Harrison in Kentucky Governors, pp. 82‚Äì84 Hawes was once close friends with Clay, though the friendship between them cooled when Hawes supported Zachary Taylor instead of Clay for president in 1848.\\"Richard Hawes, 1797‚Äì1877: Our Cause is Steadily on the Increase\\", Lowell Harrison, in Kentucky's Civil War 1861‚Äì1865, pp. 90‚Äì91 When the Whig Party dissolved in the 1850s, Hawes became a Democrat, supporting presidential candidates James Buchanan in 1856 and John C. Breckinridge in 1860. Though alarmed by the election of Abraham Lincoln in the election of 1860, Hawes was an opponent of secession, supporting instead the idea of armed neutrality. In May 1861, Hawes, Breckinridge, and Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin represented the Southern Rights viewpoint at a convention to decide Kentucky's course in the Civil War. He attended another such convention in September 1861. Neither convention produced a conclusive decision. A July 1861 address to the people of Bourbon County, authored by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states to remain in the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery. The address called for an end to the war, recognition of the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, and equitable distribution of the national debt and federal property. =Military service= When Kentucky's neutrality was breached in September 1861, Hawes fled to Virginia to escape imprisonment by Federal authorities. While there, he enlisted as a brigade commissary under Confederate general Humphrey Marshall and was given the rank of major. Though his ability to obtain supplies for Marshall's brigade was commendable given the difficult conditions, his age (64) and lack of military experience lessened his value to Marshall's unit, and his predilection for jumping the chain of command and communicating directly with Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin put him at odds with Marshall personally. In November 1861, the self-appointed members of the Confederate state sovereignty convention in Russellville, Kentucky appointed Hawes state auditor of the Commonwealth's Confederate government, but he declined in order to continue his military service. However, he wrote President Davis on January 25, 1862 to inform him that he was traveling to Bowling Green, Kentucky at Confederate Governor George W. Johnson's request in order to assist Johnson in administering the state government. He resigned his military commission two days later, but his departure for Bowling Green was delayed when he was stricken with typhoid fever. Confederate Governor of Kentucky A historical marker in Frankfort, Kentucky documents Hawes' inauguration as Confederate governor Governor Johnson was killed while participating in the Battle of Shiloh. Following the resolutions of the Russellville Convention, the provisional Confederate government's ten legislative councillors selected Hawes to succeed Johnson as governor. (Under these provisions, the councillors could not select one of their own.) He joined the leaderless and nomadic shadow government, which had been traveling with the Army of Tennessee, in Corinth, Mississippi, and took the oath of office on May 31.Brown, p. 93 The army's leader, General Braxton Bragg, had been considering an invasion of Kentucky. On August 27, Hawes was dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to favorably recommend this action to President Jefferson Davis, but Davis was non-committal. Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith proceeded with the invasion nonetheless, while the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Hawes's return. They departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. Bragg, desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act in the Commonwealth, decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort. The ceremony took place on October 4, 1862. Humphrey Marshall gave the opening remarks, then General Bragg introduced Governor Hawes.Brown, p. 95 Hawes delivered a lengthy inaugural address in which he declared, \\"It is now a truth and a fact that the late Union cannot be restored.\\" He promised to call a convention to provide for a permanent government as soon as such a convention was feasible, and denounced the Union's goal of freeing the slaves. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Union general Don Carlos Buell. Hawes later denied ever taking the oath of office, and became a vocal critic of Bragg. Displaced from their home state, the legislative council dispersed to places where they could make a living or be supported by relatives until Governor Hawes called them into session. Scant records show that, on December 30, 1862, Hawes summoned the council, auditor, and treasurer to his location at Athens, Tennessee for a meeting on January 15, 1863. Hawes unsuccessfully lobbied President Davis to remove Hawes's former superior, Humphrey Marshall, from command. On March 4, he told Davis by letter that \\"our cause is steadily on the increase\\" and assured him that another foray into the Commonwealth would produce better results than the first had.Brown, pp. 96‚Äì97 The government's financial woes also continued. Hawes was embarrassed to admit that neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky.Brown, p. 97 Another major blow was Davis's decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky was now a part of the Confederacy. By 1864, Hawes had joined his sister at the small Virginia settlement of Nelly's Ford. His wife and daughter joined him there. This location was only from Richmond, allowing Hawes to travel easily to the Confederate capital for audiences with President Davis. Records show that as late as September 16, 1864, Hawes still maintained hope for another military advance into Kentucky. In the summer of 1864, Colonel R. A. Alston of the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry requested Governor Hawes's assistance in investigating crimes allegedly committed by General John Hunt Morgan during his unauthorized raid into Kentucky. Hawes never had to act on the request, however, as Morgan was suspended from command on August 10 and killed by Union troops on September 4, 1864. Later life and death Hawes remained at Nelly's Ford until May 1865. Finally satisfied that it was safe to return to Kentucky, Hawes arrived in Paris to find his home had been burned by Union troops. Four of Hawes's sons served in the Confederate Army, including brigadier general James Morrison Hawes; only three sons returned home from the war.\\"Hawes, James Morrison\\" in Kleber, p. 418 On September 18, 1865, Hawes took an oath of allegiance to the United States, and was allowed to return to his previous career as a lawyer. In 1866, he was elected county judge of Bourbon County. His most notable ruling in this capacity was to nullify the apprenticeship contracts of the Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky.Harrison in Register, p. 38 Hawes based this decision on the fact that the Bureau's powers extended only to states that had been part of the rebellion, which Kentucky had not. Hawes was also chosen master commissioner of the circuit court in 1866. In 1871, Hawes was mentioned as a possible candidate for governor of Kentucky. In 1876, he helped frame his party's response to the disputed Hayes‚ÄìTilden presidential election. Hawes died in Paris, Kentucky on May 25, 1877 and was interred in Paris Cemetery.

Harrison claims that the couple had two children, while Neace and Harned mention four sons. The 1850 census showed six Hawes children living in the household: four sons and two daughters. This did not include James Morrison Hawes, who was already an instructor at the United States Military Academy by 1850.

The plotline was suggested by the life of the North Carolina-born novelist Thomas Wolfe. The story was serialized in McCalls magazine from March to July 1962. Plot summary Youngblood Hawke is the story of Arthur Youngblood Hawke, an ex-Navy man from rural Kentucky who comes to New York to publish his first novel, Alms for Oblivion. Arthur's late father had literary ambitions, but his mother has a more worldly temperament and spends years trying to pry a fortune from family relations in the coal mining business. Hawke's parentage helps explain the conflict between his mastery of the written word and his sometimes obsessive hunt for wealth. After publishing his first novel, he falls in with an older married woman, Frieda Winter, with whom he maintains an emotionally tumultuous affair for too long. He also carries a torch for Jeanne Green, his editor who has helped make his work commercially viable. His second novel is an unqualified success and he becomes a literary sensation. His fame carries with it some wealth, but Arthur has a weakness for building even more wealth fast. He gets involved with Scott Hoag, a builder from his own town, who gives him the opportunity to participate in real estate developments such as suburban shopping centers. In a few years, Arthur overextends himself and winds up seriously in debt. In the end, he works himself to death between the money he owes; jealousy over Jeanne, the love of his life (who married a man she didn't love to spite him) and the tragedy of Frieda Winter's son's suicide, for which Hawke feels responsible. A head trauma from his days of coal trucking also comes into play, and (like Thomas Wolfe) he eventually dies of an infection at a young age. In his legacy after death, he achieves the status that he had sought while alive. Film adaptation Warner Brothers adapted the novel into a black-and-white film production in 1964; it featured a musical score composed by longtime Warners staff composer Max Steiner. Released on November 4, 1964, the film had a running time of 137 minutes. Reportedly to save costs, the film was shot in black and white at a time when most major productions were made in color. It was directed by Delmer Daves from a screenplay by Wouk and Daves.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16086/Youngblood-Hawke/articles.html References Category:1962 American novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels by Herman Wouk Category:Novels set in Kentucky Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Novels about writers Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"Youngblood Hawke"},{"id":"4840184","text":"Telford Central railway station serves the new town of Telford, England.

It is located on the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line north west of Wolverhampton and is operated by West Midlands Trains. History The new town of Telford was designated in the 1960s, but until the 1980s it was served only by two railway stations which predated it, Oakengates and Wellington, although Wellington was at one stage renamed \\"Wellington-Telford West\\" to indicate that it was located in the new town. The line through Telford also boasted a further station in the form of New Hadley Halt between Oakengates and Wellington until 1985. The situation changed in May 1986, when Telford Central opened. The new station was equipped with full-length platforms to accommodate inter-city trains, and a large car park, which took advantage of the station's location next to the M54 motorway to provide a park and ride facility. The ¬£700,000 cost was jointly funded by British Rail, the Telford Development Corporation and Shropshire County Council. The station and car park were built on the former Hollinswood sidings that served the Lilleshall Company and local industry. Facilities The station is staffed all week, with the ticket office open Monday - Saturday 06:00 - 19:00 and Sunday 10:00 - 17:00.

He has made 10 visits to Chinese prisons and has submitted requests for information on more than 1,000 prisoners. In an article about Kamm for The New York Times Sunday Magazine, Tina Rosenberg wrote: ‚ÄúNo other person or organization in the world, including the State Department, has helped more Chinese prisoners.\\"\\"John Kamm's Third Way,\\" Rosenberg, Tina, New York Times Sunday Magazine, March 3, 2002  Background  Kamm received an AB from Princeton University (1972) and an AM from Harvard University (1975). He served as the Hong Kong correspondent and representative of the National Council for US- China Trade (1975‚Äì1979) and vice president (1989) and president (1990) of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Kamm also managed business operations for Occidental Chemical Company in China and East Asia (1981‚Äì1991). = Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce = With no background in human rights, Kamm took his first activist stance as vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong by convincing the majority of chamber members to pass a resolution condemning China‚Äôs suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Despite strong opposition from many who thought the chamber should avoid making political statements, Kamm‚Äôs initiative was a success. As president of the chamber the following year, Kamm pressured Beijing to release individuals who were imprisoned for their participation in the Tiananmen Square protests. He also advocated for the extension of China‚Äôs Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status, arguing that engagement with China is more effective than sanctions at improving the status of political detainees.Committee Looks at Renewal of China‚Äôs MFN Status = Advocacy work = From 1991 to 1994‚Äîthe year US President Bill Clinton unconditionally renewed China‚Äôs MFN trade status, Kamm started doing advocacy work full-time. Traveling frequently to China, he raised the names of hundreds of prisoners and received verbal information from the Chinese government on more than half of them. In 1995, China‚Äôs State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Justice agreed to receive from Kamm quarterly prisoner lists of up to 25 names and began providing written responses on many of the cases. Over the following years, the willingness of the Chinese government to cooperate with Kamm fluctuated in step with US-China relations. Despite periodic obstacles, Kamm continued traveling to Beijing and submitting prisoner lists. Although US-China relations were strained during the first half of 1999, Kamm went ahead with plans to establish Dui Hua in April 1999, serving as its first chairman and executive director. Kamm‚Äôs work has enabled many of China‚Äôs political and religious prisoners to receive clemency in the form of sentence reductions, parole, and early releases, as well as better treatment in prison. One such person who benefited from Kamm‚Äôs interventions, Tibetan nun Ngawang Sangdrol, was the focus of Marie Louville‚Äôs documentary film, Prisoner in Lhasa. The film documents how Kamm‚Äôs work contributed to Ngawang Sangdrol‚Äôs release.Prisoner of Lhasa Today, Kamm continues to travel throughout the United States, Europe, and China to meet with government officials, legal experts, and scholars on issues ranging from political and religious detainees, juvenile justice reform, women in prison and the implementation of the Bangkok Rules (Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders), and death penalty and criminal justice reform.

The MMRV vaccine is typically given to children between one and two years of age. Several companies supply MMRV vaccines. ProQuad is marketed by Merck and was approved in 2005, for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children ages twelve months through twelve years. An MMRV vaccine called Priorix Tetra by GlaxoSmithKline has been approved in Germany and Australia. Recommendations The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccinating against measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), and varicella (chickenpox) because the risks of these diseases far outweigh the risks of vaccinating against them. In particular, the World Health Organization recommends varicella vaccination in countries where the vaccine is affordable, the disease is a relatively important problem, and high and sustained vaccine coverage can be achieved. The United States and a few other countries have widely implemented this. MMR and varicella vaccine are given at roughly the same time and a booster injection is recommended for both. The MMRV vaccine, a combined MMR and varicella vaccine, simplifies administration of the vaccines. Contraindications * For individuals who are moderately or severely ill, it is generally recommended that they wait until after recovery before getting ProQuad. No such precautions are recommended for minor illnesses, such as a cold. * It is recommended that aspirin or aspirin containing products be avoided for at least six weeks after receiving ProQuad vaccine (aspirin is not recommended in children under 16 in any case). A serious condition called Reye's syndrome has been reported in patients with chicken pox and influenza. * Individuals should not receive ProQuad without first consulting their doctor if there is a history of a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, eggs, the antibiotic neomycin, or a previous MMR or chicken pox vaccine. Doctors are advised to be aware of whether or not a patient has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system, is taking a medication that affects the immune system, has cancer, a fever or active untreated tuberculosis, is receiving cancer treatment, or has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder). Adverse events Rare but serious adverse events reported following ProQuad vaccination include allergic reactions, including swelling of the lips, tongue, or face; difficulty breathing or closing of the throat; hives; paleness; weakness; dizziness; a fast heart beat; deafness; long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness; seizures (jerking or staring) caused by fever; or temporary low platelet count. For children age two and younger, the MMRV vaccine is associated with more adverse events compared to separate administration of MMR and varicella vaccinations on the same day.CDC: Possible Side-effects from Vaccines There are 4.3 additional febrile seizures per 10,000 vaccinated children (95% CI 2.6‚Äì5.6), 7.5 additional mostly mild fever episodes per 100 vaccinated children (95% CI, 5.4‚Äì9.4) and 1.1 additional measles-like rash per 100 children (95% CI, 0.2‚Äì1.8). Febrile seizures caused by the MMRV vaccine occur 7 to 10 days after vaccination. In children age 4‚Äì6, there is no evidence for an increased risk in febrile seizures after MMRV compared to the separate administration of MMR and Varicella vaccines.FDA: CBER clinical review of studies submitted in support of licensure of ProQuad  Society and culture   Legal status  ProQuad was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2005, in the European Union in April 2006, and in Australia in February 2007.

It is around 30x more potent than THC, and exhibits antiemetic and analgesic effects via activation of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Levonantradol is not currently used in medicine as dronabinol or nabilone are felt to be more useful for most conditions, however it is widely used in research into the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids. Pharmacodynamics Levonantradol is a full CB1 receptor agonist. Cannabinoid receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and endogenous cannabinoids naturally activate GPCRs. GPCRs modulate the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and accumulation of the second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The CB1 receptor is the most common GPCR in the central nervous system. The activation of CB1Rs decrease calcium conductance and increase potassium conductance in the brain. CB signaling naturally modulates synaptic transmission and mediates psychoactivity, and synthetic cannabinoids mimic these same actions. Although the efficacy of Levonantradol is dependent on the level of GCPR activity, Full agonists like Levonantradol have the ability to activate GPCRs and convert GŒ± into a high affinity state for GTP or low affinity state for GDP. Previous studies suggest that Levonantradol has a higher binding affinity and efficacy than other similar synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. Œî9-THC). Pharmacokinetics Although Levonantradol has been extensively tested on animals including cats, rodents, and non-human primates. It has also been tested among cancer patient populations in clinical trials. Levonantradol is most commonly administered intramuscularly (I.M.), however it can also be administered orally. The dosage can range from 0.25 mg-3.0 mg every 2‚Äì4 hours, and the half-life is 1‚Äì2 hours. In order to administer Levonantradol intramuscularly, the drug must be dissolved in 5% ethanol, 5% emulphur, and 90% sterile saline. Synthetic cannabinoids like Levonantradol readily cross the blood-brain barrier because they are highly lipophilic and have low molecular weights. Levonantradol‚Äôs bioavailability is variable due to the first pass metabolism. Treatment Levonantradol has been clinically tested in cancer patients for its pain relief and antiemetic benefits. Cancer patients that endure chemotherapy often develop intense nausea, and Levonantradol has been tested to reduce these emetic symptoms. It is often used instead of THC because it has a higher efficacy. Levonantradol also acts on pain pathways in the central nervous system, which enables the drug to alleviate pain. Studies have shown an absence of emetic side effects within the half-life of the Levonantradol administered. Other studies suggest that cannabinoid agonists can synergize opioid anti-nociception. Cannabinoid receptors are located in nociceptive pathways, and CBs can promote signal transduction in TRP channels. Although Levonantradol relieves nociceptive and postoperative pain, decreases nausea, and improves spasticity in addition to being more effective than placebos, it has yet to be approved as legal medicine. Researchers have concluded that Levonantradol is no more effective than Codeine, which is why they do not recommend expansion into clinical practice. Side effects The side effects for Levonantradol include ptosis, sedation, and ataxia in non-human primates. In rodents, the symptoms include dysphoria, memory impairment, motor incoordination, reduced concentration, and disorientation. Levonantradol also decreases startle response. In humans, side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, altered perception, mild sedation, and lack of concentration. It can cause an increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure. Euphoric symptoms rarely occurred in subjects. Synthesis Nantradol synthesis: asymmetric: Dane salt formation between 3,5-dimethoxyaniline and ethyl acetoacetate followed by borohydrate reduction gives synthon 1. The amino group is protected by rxn with ethyl chloroformate, the ester group is saponified, and then cyclodehydration with polyphosphoric acid leads to the dihydroquinoline ring system (2). Deblocking with HBr is followed by etherification of the nonchelated phenolic hydroxyl gives 3. Treatment with NaH and ethyl formate results in both N-formylation and C-formylation of the active methylene to give 4. Michael addition of methyl vinyl ketone (MVP) followed by successive base treatments to remove the activating C-formyl group and then to complete the Robinson annulation to give 5. Lithium in liquid ammonia reduces the olefinic linkage and successive acetylation and sodium borohydrate reductions complete the synthesis of nantradol (6).

Career  Douglas was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, into a theatrical family; his father was a theatre producer and his brother, Bill Roberton, became a theatre director. His mother was so keen that he be a Geordie that, according to Douglas, although they had settled in London, He spent his early years on a farm in Meriden.Carry On Dick Special Edition DVD ‚Äì Jack Douglas, Audio Commentary, 12 February 2003, Carlton Television and the family later moved to Blackpool to get away from the bombing in the Second World War. Like his father, Jack wanted to work in theatre but his father forbade him, so at the age of 14, he got his things together and moved out into a place of his own. Going to the local Feldman's Theatre, he asked if they wanted a Lime Boy, and they did since so many men had gone off to war. He was hired as an \\"Opposite Prompt Lime Boy\\" for ¬£1.5s a week and paid for his \\"digs\\" and everything out of that, even saving some money. His father found out where he was working and asked them to give him all the dirty jobs to try and discourage him but Jack did them all without any complaint, so come his fifteenth birthday, his father gave him a present. A script for a Cinderella pantomime, which he was to direct. Having seen his father direct three or four pantomimes, Jack knew what to do, and did 22 weeks at the Empire Theatre, Sunderland. Later, he was to direct a show at the Kingston Empire, only to have a lead actor taken to hospital with a heart attack on the opening night before the show started. Joe Baker, who was also playing a lead role, suggested Douglas take over the role as he was the only other person who knew the lines (as he did all the lines of all the characters, being the director). A top agent in the audience that night was so impressed that he visited Douglas and Baker after the show; he was surprised to learn that they had only been a double act for two hours and thirty-five minutes, and immediately signed them up as such. Douglas and Baker spent ten years touring the world, playing in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa amongst other places. Coming back to Britain again, they did a season at a Butlins holiday camp and not liking the food served there, Douglas cooked in their chalet (which was forbidden) for both of them and a guest. One evening there was a knock on the door and Billy Butlin was standing there. He noticed the smell and asked if they had enough for four. They did, and he ate with them. From there they went to the BBC to begin the popular children's TV show Crackerjack, with Eamonn Andrews as host. They found themselves working on it from 9:30 am to 2:30 pm each day; their agent fitted in another two jobs, so that the pair made ¬£100 a week (minus his 10%), a huge amount of money then. Following this, they moved on to the Windmill Theatre and later at the Glasgow Empire, where they found they could get laughs by merely putting on American accents (English actors \\"died\\" there). After that, Joe Baker went to America to try his luck there. On his own for the first time in so many years, Douglas told his agent, Leslie Grade, that he wanted to be a comedian. Grade told him no chance as he did not have a funny face, so Douglas left show business and as he loved cooking, he opened up a restaurant in Blackpool. It turned out to be too successful and he found he personally had nothing to do there, the staff doing everything. One night, he got a call as he was going up to his flat above the restaurant; it was Des O'Connor, who had a contract with ATV for 13 shows, and he wanted Douglas to star with him. He readily agreed, and O'Connor pretty much let him do what he liked. They did a Royal Variety Show together, O'Connor insisting to Bernard Delfont that Douglas went with him, as he later insisted that after the show, they meet the Queen Mother together, or O'Connor would not do so himself. He worked with O'Connor for several years and in the theatre, developing a nervous character \\"Alf Ippititimus\\", notable for his \\"phwaay!\\" catchphrase and his apparent muscular tics. \\"Alf\\" was created one night at Butlins in Clacton, when Douglas's co-star, Joe Baker failed to appear having been locked out of the theatre, and Douglas began to improvise based on a band leader he knew. His agent later phoned him and said he had a part in a Carry On film, but the bad news was that he would not be paid (Peter Rogers, it was said, would give his actors anything but money). He accepted the small part; in return, a black Rolls Royce pulled up outside his house one morning, bringing a box from Peter Rogers. It contained a dozen bottles of Dom P√©rignon champagne, as his payment for the film. Douglas appeared in the last seven Carry On films of the original series‚ÄîCarry On Matron, Carry On Abroad, Carry On Girls, Carry On Dick, Carry On Behind, Carry On England and Carry On Emmannuelle. His Carry On roles progressed from a cameo with one line of dialogue in Matron to a slightly larger but still inconspicuous cameo appearance in Abroad, after which he appeared in increasingly larger supporting roles, and ultimately a leading role in Emmanuelle. During this period he also appeared in the Carry on Christmas specials in 1972, and 1973 and the Carry On Laughing television series. He appeared in the revival film Carry On Columbus (1992). After the Carry On films, the cast with Douglas went to the Victoria Palace Theatre where they played to packed houses for the next 12 months in the stage show Carry On London. He also guest-starred in The Goodies episode \\"Goodies in the Nick\\" and appeared in The Shillingbury Blowers and its associated series Shillingbury Tales in the early 1980s. In December 2001, he appeared on the BBC radio show That Reminds Me (Series 3, episode 4, repeated 27 May 2014 on BBC Radio 4 Extra) where he talked about his life. On 26 April 2007, Douglas celebrated his 80th birthday. There was a special celebration arranged at Pinewood Studios, to coincide with his anniversary, which was attended by his family and friends. These included actors that Douglas had worked with; amongst them were Fenella Fielding, Jacki Piper, Lance Percival and Valerie Leon. Jack Douglas died of pneumonia on 18 December 2008.

The manga shared the same characters and setting as the anime, but presented a different storyline. A second manga was serialised in Megami Magazine, with a radically different setting and a comic rather than serious and dramatic tone. There is also a two-volume light novel adaptation, which unlike the manga has a storyline close to that of the anime. In May 2007, Simoun was licensed for release in North America by Media Blasters. Plot =Setting and themes= Simoun takes place on the earth-like planet . The people of Daik≈´riku are all born female. The theocratic nation of Simulacrum has a monopoly on the helical motor technology and as a result grew to prosperity. The two nations Argentum and Plumbum wage war against it in an attempt to steal the technology. In Simulacrum, the girls grow up until age of seventeen, when they make a pilgrimage to a holy place known as \\"the Spring\\" to select their permanent sex.Episode 2: Guragief explains this to Chor Tempest Simulacrum is defended by advanced airships known as \\"Simoun\\", two-seater aircraft propelled by two helical motors. Simoun are piloted by priestesses known as , each a girl who has not yet chosen a permanent sex; doing so renders one physically incapable of piloting a Simoun.Episode 1: Paraietta: \\"If you go to the Spring, you will never be able to touch a Simoun again. Is that okay?\\" sibyllae are organized into \\"choirs\\" or \\"chor\\" of twelve that pilot six Simoun when at full strength. The sibyllae can inscribe enormous glyphs known as Ri MƒÅjon in the sky using the Simoun to produce powerful magical effects both for combat and ceremony. =Story= A war breaks out between three nations Simulacrum, Argentum, and Plumbum over Simulacrum helical motor technology that powers the airships known as Simouns. Two fleets of the Simoun, Chor Caput and Chor Tempest, stumble upon a huge Argentum airship fleet attempting steal a Simoun. Suffering massive losses in the battle, the pair Neviril and Amuria of Chor Tempest attempt an extremely powerful but extremely dangerous maneuver out of desperation named the ; Neviril hesitates after making eye contact with the enemy, and the pair fail resulting in an explosion that takes Amuria with it. The fight leaves the sibyllae or members of Chor Tempest extremely demoralized and Neviril in despair. Four new sibyllae join Chor Tempest, one of them an excellent pilot with an unshakeable morale named Aer. Aer immediately decides to partner with Neviril, however despite her persistent attempts, Neviril remains too mired in her grief over Amuria's death to accept her. After continued battles with Chor Tempest, the Plumbish government eventually sues for peace. Neviril's father orders two sibyllae to join Chor Tempest bringing it back to full strength and assigns one to be Neviril's partner in attempt to jar his daughter out of her depression; however Neviril, becoming more accepting of Aer, rejects her. A Plumbish suicide bomber sabotages the peace talks jarring Neviril out of her funk and she agrees to pair with Aer. Chor Tempest beings to operate aggressively against the enemy nations. But in an ensuing battle, the enemy manage separate Chor Tempest forcing two of its sibyllae, Limone and Domin≈´ra, to in desperation perform the Emerald Ri MƒÅjon. They succeed, but disappear without a trace. Chor Tempest retreats to secure Simulacrum's holiest site, the Ruins. There, Aer and Neviril learn that Emerald Ri MƒÅjon allows the sibyllae piloting the Simoun to travel through time. Limone and Domin≈´ra are shown to have landed in the distant past where they pass on the knowledge of the Emerald Ri MƒÅjon. Chor Tempest continue to fight as they slowly retreat back, and eventually Simulacrum sues for peace. The allied Plumbish and Argentum forces demand in their terms that all sibyllae become adults by visiting the holy Spring, thereby no longer being able to pilot Simoun. While the members Chor Tempest head off to the Spring, Aer and Neviril stay back and soon confess their feelings for each other. The allied occupation arrest them, however with the help of their former choirmates and the Plumbish priestesses, Aer and Neviril break free and say their farewells. Performing the Emerald Ri MƒÅjon, the two vanish in a flash of light. Media =Anime= The anime has been released on DVD in Japan by Bandai Visual.

Reception Erica Friedman, the president of Yuricon and ALC Publishing, named Simoun \\"Best Yuri of 2006\\", speaking highly of its soundtrack, artwork, and story. On the negative side, she reprimanded the character designs, especially Neviril's, comparing her to \\"a sex toy blow up doll\\". Similarly, Mark Thomas of Anime on DVD called Neviril's design \\"unreal\\", lacking the \\"natural feel\\" of other characters but has justified it with the \\"goddess-like\\" role she plays in the series. Anime News Network has also noted Neviril's \\"true charisma\\" after she comes out of her \\"crippling funk\\" by episode eight. Friedman praised the Media Blasters release for having a mostly very good translation, for leaving in the honorifics (although no explanation was given for the honorifics on the disc). Friedman criticized the Media Blasters release for having strange romanizations of proper nouns, which were insisted upon by the Japanese owners and for having no insert pictures. Anime News Network praised the story for not having to rely on its yuri content and for being a creative mecha series that provides food for thought. Its tone is different from other teen pilot series, as it is \\"never grim\\". The characters are also noted as being more than \\"one-note cookie cutter portrayals\\". The use of penciled still shots remaining on the screen for some time was criticized. The series' resolution was perceived as partially satisfactory, as some elements were \\"bitter\\".

Avanti West Coast do not currently call at Oakengates station. Between Oakengates and Telford Central is the Oakengates Tunnel. Oakengates Tunnel This tunnel was a major problem in the construction of the railway. It delayed the project by 3 years, between 1846 and 1849. Details of the difficulties include unseasonable weather contained in a report of 21 August 1848 from Robert Stephenson, Consulting Engineer, and William Baker, the Shropshire Union Railway Engineer. It was originally built for broad gauge railways. This tunnel is the only tunnel on the Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton line and the longest of the three railway tunnels presently in use in Shropshire. It stretches for 471 yards. The tunnel passed under the summit level of the Shropshire Canal and was the scene of a disaster in 1855, when a breach from the canal into the tunnel occurred. The entire summit level emptied into the tunnel, causing flooding in the town, although there were no reports of any personal injury.Oakengates History: Shropshire Canal An accident occurred at the station on 11 September 1877 when a Great Western train, the 7:40 am from Shrewsbury, arrived at Oakengates station on time at 8:09 am.

Phrase search is one of many search operators that are standard in search engine technology, along with Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT), truncation and wildcard operators (commonly represented by the asterisk symbol), field code operators (which look for specific words in defined fields, such as the Author field in a periodical database), and proximity operators (which look for defined words that appear close to one another, if not directly next to each other as in a phrase search). Search operators are used to refine a search when a simple keyword search provides too many unwanted results. Although the exact functionality of each search engine is determined by its developers, phrase searching is normally accomplished by wrapping the desired phrase in quotation marks. For example, a search for \`red apple\` may return records that contain the word \\"apple,\\" ones that contain \\"red,\\" and ones that contain both words no matter where in the record they appear (that is, assuming the search engine applies Boolean OR logic to its keyword search function), whereas a search for \`\\"red apple\\"\` will only return records that contain the phrase \\"red apple.\\" Phrase search is one of the more important techniques associated with optimizing the textual content of web pages in such a way that it is likely to be found by someone searching for a certain string of text.

Early Life and Education In 1973, Patten moved from Wisconsin to San Francisco. He studied computer science in college and has worked off and on in the computer industry ever since. Patten skated for various professional roller derby leagues from 1973 to 1992. In 1988 he became owner of the San Francisco Bay Bombers team. He later formed his own league, the San Francisco-based American Roller Derby League (ARDL), which has gone through several incarnations but generally focuses on promoting a team named the Bay City Bombers. Later Career The award-winning documentary film Jam, screening at film festivals and special events in 2006, followed Patten's attempts, from 1998 to 2004, to find success with his league. The documentary Jam also appeared on the SUNDANCE channel for 2.5 years on rotation. For four years, while seeking treatment for an HIV- related neurological infection, the infection was healed through progressive medications, Patten wrote the novel Roller Babes: the Story of the Roller Derby Queen, which he self-published under his sister's name D. M. Bordner in 2005. She receives his royalties. The novel was described in an independent, Michigan-based publication as \\"a fictional yet historically accurate and personalized account of the national women's roller derby leagues in the 1950s\\". Film rights to the novel were sold to Kaliber Films in July 2006. In 2014, Patten wrote the book, honoring Herbivour and MGTOW: Why I Cheat: Men, Marriage, and Cheating.

This effect is in contrast to anxiolytic agents, which inhibits anxiety. Together these categories of psychoactive compounds may be referred to as anxiotropic compounds. Anxiogenic effects can be measured by, for example, the hole-board test in rats and mice. A number of agents are used to provoke anxiety (anxiogens) or panic (panicogens) in experimental models. Some of the most common substances are: carbon dioxide (as carbogen), sodium lactate, substituted amphetamines, caffeine, L-DOPA, methylphenidate, modafinil, GABA antagonists such as DMCM, FG-7142 and ZK-93426, serotonergic agents such as mCPP and LY-293,284, adrenergic agents such as yohimbine, antipsychotics/dopamine antagonists such as ecopipam and reserpine, and cholecystokinin (CCK) (especially the tetrapeptide and octapeptide fragments CCK-4 and CCK-8). Sodium lactate given intravenously has been proven to cause panic attacks in people with a panic disorder but not in people with no such history. The GABAA receptor negative allosteric modulator flumazenil can cause panic attacks in people with panic disorder. Anxiolytic substances have the opposite effect: they reduce anxiety. The most common class of anxiolytic drugs are the benzodiazepines. However, studies suggest that benzodiazepines may be anxiogenic in the long term. Galanter, Marc (1 July 2008).

Published in June 1999, Hickam wrote Back to the Moon using insider information he learned from NASA. Plot summary The prologue of the novel begins with a dramatized account of the second EVA of Apollo 17. Astronaut Jack Schmitt discovers orange soil in Shorty Crater at the very end of the EVA and gathers samples in a race against time to get back to the LEM. Meanwhile, Wernher von Braun is watching the end of the mission on TV with other NASA engineers. Katrina Suttner, the young daughter of one of von Braun's colleagues, is in on a secret involving the mission, and is certain that humans will soon return to the Moon. The novel then skips ahead 30 years. Jack Medaris, the protagonist, is preparing the launch of a privately funded, unmanned mission to the Moon to gather more of the orange soil, which appears to have enormous potential as a source of clean nuclear energy on Earth. Shortly before launch, Medaris' probe is destroyed by unknown terrorists or saboteurs. It also becomes clear that Medaris is driven to go to the Moon to recover the secret left by Katrina, who later became his wife and was killed in a test-stand accident. Medaris hatches a plot to hijack the Space Shuttle Columbia on a routine mission. The plan nearly comes off, but his renegade pilot is accidentally shot and killed, and one payload specialist from the planned crew, Penny High Eagle, launches with him. Medaris takes the controls of Columbia, and gradually persuades High Eagle that she should help him, if only for their mutual survival. NASA also reluctantly agrees to help, in order to prevent the loss of their spacecraft. Medaris has developed a new rocket motor which will make it possible to take Columbia into lunar orbit. With the help of High Eagle, he is able to attach the smuggled engine, and boost the shuttle to the Moon. He has also smuggled a bare-bones LEM, of his own design, aboard the shuttle, which will allow him to make a one-man EVA to the Apollo 17 landing site. Back on Earth, a mysterious consortium is using a private security company to try to sabotage Medaris' mission by any means possible, including hiring a group of computer hackers to take control of a set of hunter-killer satellites parked behind the Moon, and persuading Roscosmos to intervene and take over the shuttle in LEO. In spite of these obstacles, Medaris successfully lands on the Moon, gets the orange soil, retrieves the message from Katrina, and returns to Earth. High Eagle and Medaris form a romantic and physical relationship during the return.

For prevention they are only recommended in those with poor absorption, heavy menstrual periods, pregnancy, hemodialysis, or a diet low in iron. Prevention may also be used in low birth weight babies. They are taken by mouth, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle. While benefits may be seen in days up to two months may be required until iron levels return to normal. Common side effects include constipation, abdominal pain, dark stools, and diarrhea. Other side effects, which may occur with excessive use, include iron overload and iron toxicity. Ferrous salts used as supplements by mouth include ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous succinate, and ferrous sulfate. Injectable forms include iron dextran and iron sucrose. They work by providing the iron needed for making red blood cells. Iron pills have been used medically since at least 1681, with an easy-to-use formulation being created in 1832. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines,. Ferrous salts are available as a generic medication and over the counter. Slow release formulations, while available, are not recommended. In 2017, ferrous sulfate was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than eight million prescriptions. Medical uses Iron supplements are used to treat iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia;Ferinject (ferric n 2012-12-21. parenteral irons can also be used to treat functional iron deficiency, where requirements for iron are greater than the body's ability to supply iron such as in inflammatory states. The main criterion is that other causes of anemia have also been investigated, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, drug induced or due to other poisons such as lead, as often the anaemia has more than one underlying cause. Iron deficiency anemia is classically a microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Generally, in the UK oral preparations are trialled before using parenteral delivery.Goddard AF, James MW, McIntyre AS and Scott BB (May 2005). Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia . British Society of Gastroenterology unless there is the requirement for a rapid response, previous intolerance to oral iron or likely failure to respond. Intravenous iron may decrease the need for blood transfusions however increases the risk of infections when compared to oral iron. A 2015 Cochrane Collaboration review found that daily oral supplementation of iron during pregnancy reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and that effects on infant and on other maternal outcomes are not clear. Another review found tentative evidence that intermittent iron supplements by mouth is similar for mothers and babies as daily supplementation with less side effects. Supplements by mouth should be taken on an empty stomach, optionally with a small amount of food to reduce discomfort. =Athletes= Athletes may be at elevated risk of iron deficiency and so benefit from supplementation, but the circumstances vary between individuals and dosage should be based on tested ferritin levels, since in some cases supplementation may be harmful. Side effects Side effects of therapy with oral iron are most often diarrhea or constipation and epigastric abdominal discomfort. Taken after a meal, side effects decrease, but there is an increased risk of interaction with other substances. Side effects are dose-dependent, and the dose may be adjusted. The patient may notice that his/her stools become black. This is completely harmless, but patients must be warned about this to avoid unnecessary concern. When iron supplements are given in a liquid form, teeth may reversibly discolor (this can be avoided through the use of a straw). Intramuscular injection can be painful, and brown discoloration may be noticed. Treatments with iron(II) sulfate have higher incidence of adverse events than iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex (IPC) or iron bis- glycinate chelate. Iron overdose has been one of the leading causes of death caused by toxicological agents in children younger than 6 years. Iron poisoning may result in mortality or short-term and long-term morbidity.Toxicity, Iron (Overview) . Tripdatabase.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-21. = Infection risk = Because one of the functions of elevated ferritin (an acute phase reaction protein) in acute infections is thought to be to sequester iron from bacteria, it is generally thought that iron supplementation (which circumvents this mechanism) should be avoided in patients who have active bacterial infections. Replacement of iron stores is seldom such an emergency situation that it cannot wait for any such acute infection to be treated. Some studies have found that iron supplementation can lead to an increase in infectious disease morbidity in areas where bacterial infections are common. For example, children receiving iron-enriched foods have demonstrated an increased rate in diarrhea overall and enteropathogen shedding. Iron deficiency protects against infection by creating an unfavorable environment for bacterial growth. Nevertheless, while iron deficiency might lessen infections by certain pathogenic diseases, it also leads to a reduction in resistance to other strains of viral or bacterial infections, such as Salmonella typhimurium or Entamoeba histolytica. Overall, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether iron supplementation will be beneficial or harmful to an individual in an environment that is prone to many infectious diseases; however this is a different question than the question of supplementation in individuals who are already ill with a bacterial infection. Children living in areas prone for malarial infections are also at risk of developing anemia. It was thought that iron supplementation given to such children could increase the risk of malarial infection in them. A Cochrane systematic review published in 2016 found high quality evidence that iron supplementation does not increase the risk of clinical malaria in children. Contraindications Contraindications often depend on the substance in question. Documented hypersensitivity to any ingredients and anemias without proper work-up (i.e., documentation of iron deficiency) is true of all preparations. Some can be used in iron deficiency, others require iron deficiency anaemia to be present. Some are also contraindicated in rheumatoid arthritis.CosmoFer ‚Äì Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) ‚Äì (eMC) . Medicines.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-21. =Hemochromatosis= Individuals may be genetically predisposed to excessive iron absorption, as is the case with those with HFE hereditary hemochromatosis. Within the general population, 1 out of 400 people has the homozygous form of this genetic trait, and 1 out of every 10 people has its heterozygous form. Neither individuals with the homozygous or heterozygous form should take iron supplements. Interactions Non-heme iron forms an insoluble complex with several other drugs, resulting in decreased absorption of both iron and the other drug. Examples include tetracycline, penicillamine, methyldopa, levodopa, bisphosphonates and quinolones. The same can occur with elements in food, such as calcium. Absorption of iron is better at a low pH (i.e. an acidic environment), and absorption is decreased if there is a simultaneous intake of antacids. Many other substances decrease the rate of non-heme iron absorption. Examples are tannins from foods, such as tea and saw palmetto, phytic acid, and roughage.Boosting iron absorption: A guide to for the science-minded . Parentingscience.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-21. Vegetarians and especially vegans are at increased risk of iron deficiency due to the combination of limited amounts of iron in the diet in a form that is poorly absorbed alongside compounds that further limit absorption. Taken after a meal, there are fewer side effects but there is also less absorption because of interaction and pH alteration. Generally, an interval of 2‚Äì3 hours between the iron intake and that of other drugs seems advisable, but is less convenient for patients and can impact on compliance.

Blaud of Beaucaire, the French physician who introduced and started the use of these medications as a treatment for patients with anemia., p. 435. Administration =By mouth= Iron can be supplemented by mouth using various forms, such as iron(II) sulfate. This is the most common and well studied soluble iron salt sold under brand names such as Feratab, Fer-Iron, and Slow-FE. It is in complex with gluconate, dextran, carbonyl iron, and other salts. Ascorbic acid, vitamin C, increases the absorption of non-heme sources of iron. Heme iron polypeptide (HIP) (e.g. Proferrin ES and Proferrin Forte) can be used when regular iron supplements such as ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate are not tolerated or absorbed. A clinical study demonstrated that HIP increased serum iron levels 23 times greater than ferrous fumarate on a milligram-per-milligram basis. Another alternative is ferrous glycine sulfate or ferroglycine sulfate, has less gastrointestinal side-effects than standard preparations such as iron fumarate. It is unusual among oral preparations of iron supplements in that the iron in this preparation has very high oral bioavailability, especially in the liquid formulation. This option should be evaluated before resorting to parenteral therapy. It is especially useful in iron deficiency anemia associated with autoimmune gastritis and Helicobacter pylori gastritis, where it generally has satisfactory effect. Since iron stores in the body are generally depleted, and there is a limit to what the body can process (about 2‚Äì6 mg/kg of body mass per day; i.e. for a 100 kg/220 lb man this is equal to a maximum dose of 200‚Äì600 mg/per day) without iron poisoning, this is a chronic therapy which may take 3‚Äì6 months.Iron Poisoning . Webmd.com (2012-09-27). Retrieved on 2012-12-21. Due to the frequent intolerance of oral iron and the slow improvement, parenteral iron is recommended in many indications. =By injection= Iron therapy (intravenously or intramuscular) is given when therapy by mouth has failed (not tolerated), oral absorption is seriously compromised (by illnesses, or when the person cannot swallow), benefit from oral therapy cannot be expected, or fast improvement is required (for example, prior to elective surgery). Parenteral therapy is more expensive than oral iron preparations and is not suitable during the first trimester of pregnancy. There are cases where parenteral iron is preferable over oral iron. These are cases where oral iron is not tolerated, where the haemoglobin needs to be increased quickly (e.g. post partum, post operatively, post transfusion), where there is an underlying inflammatory condition (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) or renal patients, the benefits of parenteral iron far outweigh the risks. In many cases, use of intravenous iron such as ferric carboxymaltose has lower risks of adverse events than a blood transfusion and as long as the person is stable is a better alternative. Ultimately this always remains a clinical decision based on local guidelines, although National Guidelines are increasingly stipulating IV iron in certain groups of patients. Soluble iron salts have a significant risk of adverse effects and can cause toxicity due to damage to cellular macromolecules. Delivering iron parenterally has utilised various different molecules to limit this. This has included dextrans, sucrose, carboxymaltose and more recently Isomaltoside 1000. One formulation of parenteral iron is iron dextran which covers the old high molecular weight (trade name DexFerrum) and the much safer low molecular iron dextrans (tradenames including Cosmofer and Infed). Iron sucrose has an occurrence of allergic reactions of less than 1 in 1000.Venofer in FASS (drug formulary), translated from Swedish \\"Allergiska reaktioner (intr√§ffar hos f√§rre √§n 1 av 1 000 patienter)\\" and \\"Vanliga (intr√§ffar hos f√§rre √§n 1 av 10 patienter): Tillf√§lliga smakf√∂r√§ndringar (speciellt metallsmak).\\" A common side effect is taste changes, especially a metallic taste, occurring in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 treated patients. It has a maximum dose of 200 mg on each occasion according to the SPC, but it has been given in doses of 500 mg. Doses can be given up to 3 times a week Iron carboxymaltose is marketed as Ferinject, Injectafer, and Iroprem in various countries. The most common side effects are headaches which occur in 3.3%, and hypophosphatemia, which occurs in more than 35%.Ferinject (ferric carboxymaltose) ‚Äì Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) ‚Äì (eMC) .

Iron Isomaltoside 1000 (Trade name Monofer) is a newer formulation of parenteral iron that has a matrix structure that results in very low levels of free iron and labile iron. It can be given at high doses ‚Äì 20 mg/kg in a single visit ‚Äì no upper dose limit. This formulation has the benefit of giving a full iron correction in a single visit. =Follow-up= Follow-up is needed to ensure compliance and to detect adequate response to therapy. The interval of follow up can widely depend on both the method of administration, and the underlying pathology. For parenteral irons it is recommended that there be a period of 4 weeks before repeating blood test to allow the body to utilise the iron. For oral iron, this can take considerably longer, so waiting three months may be appropriate.

The 1985-86 series was produced by Caltech and INTELECOM, a nonprofit consortium of California community colleges now known as Intelecom Learning, with financial support from Annenberg/CPB.  Overview  Produced starting in 1982, the videos make heavy use of historical dramatizations and visual aids to explain physics concepts. The latter were state of the art at the time, incorporating almost eight hours of computer animation created by computer graphics pioneer Jim Blinn. Each episode opens and closes with bookend segments in which Caltech professor David Goodstein, speaking in a lecture hall, delivers explanations \\"that can't quite be put into the mouth of our affable, faceless narrator\\". After more than a quarter century, the series is still often used as a supplemental teaching aid, for its clear explanation of fundamental concepts such as special relativity. The bookend segments featuring Goodstein were specially staged versions of actual freshman physics lectures from Caltech's courses Physics 1a and 1b. The organization and the choice of topics to emphasize in the television show reflect a then-recent revision of Caltech's introductory physics curriculum, the first total overhaul since the one represented by The Feynman Lectures on Physics almost two decades earlier. While Feynman generally sought contemporary examples of topics, the later revision of the curriculum brought a more historical focus: > In essence, the earlier Feynman course had sought to make physics exciting > by relating each subject, wherever possible, to contemporary scientific > problems. The new course took the opposite tack, of trying to recreate the > historical excitement of the original discovery. For example, classical > mechanics‚Äîa notoriously difficult and uninspiring subject for students‚Äîis > treated as the discovery of \\"our place in the universe\\". Accordingly, > celestial mechanics is the backbone of the subject and its climax is > Newton's solution of the Kepler problem. Production details The room seen in the bookend segments is the Bridge lecture hall at Caltech. Many of the extras were students from other schools, and the front rows of the lecture hall were deliberately filled with more women than would have typically been seen at Caltech lectures. The TV production team added fake wood paneling to the lecture hall so that it would more closely resemble that seen in the show The Paper Chase. Later, the Caltech physics department was sufficiently impressed by the result that panels were installed permanently. Many seats in the lecture hall had to be removed in order to make room for the camera track and studio lights. To cover this, additional reaction shots of a full lecture hall were filmed later, so that the illusion of a complete audience could be created in editing. For most of the footage of Goodstein himself, only two rows of students were present. Many other video segments were shot on location, for example at a Linde industrial plant that produced liquid air. Historical scenes were often made to be generic, in order to facilitate their reuse across multiple episodes: \\"Young Newton strolls through an apple orchard, old Newton testily refuses a cup of tea from a servant, and so on\\". Footage featuring historical reenactment of Johannes Kepler was purchased from Carl Sagan's 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. The series was originally planned to consist of 26 episodes. This was later expanded to 60 episodes, a number then cut back to the eventual total of 52 for budget and production-schedule reasons. The show was intended not to require previous experience with calculus. Instead, the basics of differential and integral calculus would both be taught early in the series itself. Caltech mathematician Tom M. Apostol joined the Mechanical Universe production staff in order to ensure that the series did not compromise on the quality of the mathematics it presented. Seeing an example of Blinn's computer animation for the first time convinced Apostol that the series could bring mathematics \\"to life in a way that cannot be done in a textbook or at the chalkboard\\". When test screenings to humanities students revealed that their greatest difficulty learning calculus was a weak background in trigonometry, Apostol wrote a primer on the subject to be distributed with the telecourse. After advising the production of The Mechanical Universe, Apostol decided that a similar series, geared to high- school mathematics, would be beneficial. This became the later Caltech series Project Mathematics!, which also featured computer animation by Blinn. Some of Blinn's animations for The Mechanical Universe were reused in the new series, in order to illustrate applications of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.See, for example, the Project Mathematics! episode \\"Sines and Cosines, Part 1\\", 25:05 and following. (Accessed 2018-01-28.) The 1990 science-fiction action movie Total Recall used portions of the Mechanical Universe title sequence, in a scene where the protagonist (Douglas Quaid, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is offered virtual vacations in locales around the Solar System. The animation was used without licensing, and consequently, Caltech and Intelecom sued Carolco Pictures for $3 million. In order to present detailed mathematical equation derivations, the show employed a technique its creators called the \\"algebraic ballet\\". Computer animation presented derivations in step-by-step detail, but rapidly and with touches of whimsy, such as algebraic terms being canceled by a Monty Python-esque stomping foot or the hand of God from Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Blinn felt that Cosmos had taken itself \\"too seriously\\", and so he aimed to include more humor in the Mechanical Universe animations. The goal was to avoid putting the viewers' \\"brains into a 60-cycle hum\\", without sacrificing rigor; the creators intended that students could learn the overall gist of each derivation from the animation, and then study the details using the accompanying textbook. Computer animation was also used to portray idealizations of physical systems, like simulated billiard balls illustrating Newton's laws of motion. (Blinn had used some of the same software earlier to visualize the interaction of DNA and DNA polymerase for Cosmos.) One commenter deemed these animations \\"particularly useful in providing students with subjective insights into dynamic three-dimensional phenomena such as magnetic fields\\". Creating the computer graphics necessary to visualize physics concepts led Blinn to invent new techniques for simulating clouds, as well as the virtual \\"blobby objects\\" known as metaballs. Blinn used the vertex coordinates of regular icosahedra and dodecahedra to determine the placement of electric field lines radiating away from point charges. Most of the narration was voiced by actor Aaron Fletcher, who also played Galileo Galilei in the historical segments. Some portions, such as explanations of particular technical details, were narrated by Sally Beaty, the show's executive producer. Shorter versions of Mechanical Universe episodes, 10 to 20 minutes in length, were created for use in high schools. This adaptation, for which a dozen high-school teachers and administrators were consultants, was supported by a $650,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. These videos were distributed alongside supplemental written material for teachers' benefit, and were intended to be employed in conjunction with existing textbooks. Yorkshire Television later produced a version repackaged for the United Kingdom audience, which was released in April 1991. Funding Annenberg/CPB provided the funding for the production of The Mechanical Universe. The show was one of the first twelve projects funded by the initial $90 million pledge the Annenberg Foundation gave to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the early 1980s. The total cost of the project was roughly $10 million. Critical reception =Initial responses= PBS and The Learning Channel began broadcasting The Mechanical Universe in September 1985. During the fall of 1986, roughly 100 PBS stations carried The Mechanical Universe, and by the fall of 1987, over 600 higher-education institutions had purchased it or licensed the episodes for use. In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, \\"usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a differential equation in the act of being solved\\". He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in Miami during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain Nielsen ratings. > In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the kiddie cartoons on > two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in Dade > County alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. > However, we seldom get that kind of detailed information. Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted, > Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very > considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to > high-school students to research university professors, but there have also > been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when Instructional > Television administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional > telecourse. Similarly, a 1988 review in Physics Today suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional classroom or a more standard distance-learning course such as Open University. The reviewers also found the \\"algebraic ballet\\" of computer-animated equations too fast to follow: \\"After a short time, one yearns for a live professor filling the blackboard with equations\\". Similarly, a review in the American Journal of Physics, while praising the \\"technical proficiency of the films\\", wrote of the animated equation manipulations, \\"As the MIT students say, this is like trying to take a drink of water out of a fire hose\\". A considerably more enthusiastic evaluation came from physicist Charles H. Holbrow, who told Olenick, \\"These materials will constitute the principal visual image of physics for decades\\". Goodstein and Olenick reported that younger viewers tended to enjoy the \\"algebraic ballet\\" style \\"much more than older viewers, who are made uncomfortable by the algebraic manipulations they cannot quite follow\\". =Classroom use= In 1986, The Mechanical Universe was used as part of a summer program for gifted children, to overall success. A 1987 study at Indiana University Bloomington used 14 Mechanical Universe episodes as part of an introductory course on Newtonian mechanics, with generally positive results: > [T]hese tapes were particularly effective in placing Newtonian mechanics in > a historical perspective; dramatizing the historical overthrow of > Aristotelian and medieval ideas; illustrating the diverse nature of > scientists and the scientific endeavor; stimulating student interest and > enthusiasm; and, through excellent animation, illustrating the time > dimension of certain mechanics concepts. The companion text [...] was placed > on library reserve for the course but was not extensively utilized by > students. A follow-up study found that the videos could also be helpful explaining physics to professors in other fields. Negative reactions generally had less to do with the intrinsic perceived quality of the episodes than with the time the science-history material took away from content seen as \\"critical exam- preparing instruction\\". The investigator recalled, > [S]ome students, thinking that the videotape material would not be covered > on the tests, headed for the doors when the lights dimmed! To counter this > tendency I started to use a few test questions based on historical or > literary details discussed in the videotapes. Some students were outraged: > \\"What is this, a poetry class?\\" Classroom use continued into the 1990s. A minority education program at the University of California, Berkeley employed Mechanical Universe episode segments (on LaserDisc) as part of group discussions. In a 1993 review of the series, a science historian stated that he had used episodes in his classes for several years, naming \\"Kepler's Three Laws\\" and \\"The Michelson‚ÄìMorley Experiment\\" as his personal favorites. > The highlight of the Kepler film is a segment in which we are shown an > exquisite graphical realization of the way in which Kepler actually figured > out that the orbits of the planets are elliptical rather than circular. The > sheer difficulty of the problem he faced and the elegance of the method he > applied to solve it are abundantly clear. I cannot imagine a better way to > present this magnificent discovery, which can easily appear so trivial. A 2005 column in The Physics Teacher suggested The Mechanical Universe as preparatory viewing for instructors attempting to teach physics for the first time. The Physics Teacher has also recommended the series \\"as enrichment or a makeup assignment for high-ability students\\". Writing for Wired magazine's web site, Rhett Allain cited the series as an example of videos that could replace some functions of traditional lectures. Awards In 1987, \\"The Lorentz Transformation\\" (episode 42) was awarded the sixteenth annual Japan Prize for educational television. Other awards received by The Mechanical Universe include the 1986 Gold Award from the Birmingham International Film Festival, two \\"Cindy\\" awards from the International Association of Audio Visual Communicators (1987 and 1988), a Gold Award (1985) and a Silver Award (1987) from the International Film and TV Festival of New York, Silver (1986) and Gold Apple (1987) awards from the National Educational Film and Video Festival, and a Gold Plaque (1985) from the Chicago International Film Festival. Goodstein received the 1999 Oersted Medal for his work in physics education, including The Mechanical Universe. For his contributions to the field of computer graphics, including his animations for Cosmos, The Mechanical Universe and Project Mathematics!, Blinn received a MacArthur fellowship in 1991, as well as the 1999 Steven A. Coons Award.  Portrayal of Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse  Like many introductory physics texts, The Mechanical Universe cites the spectacular 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge as an example of resonance, using footage of the disaster in the \\"Resonance\\" episode. However, as more-recent expositions have emphasized, the catastrophic oscillations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it‚Äîa phenomenon known as aeroelastic flutter. This phenomenon is a kind of \\"self-sustaining vibration\\" that lies beyond the regime of applicability of the linear theory of the externally-driven simple harmonic oscillator. List of episodes The opening sequence used for the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: > In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of > human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by > the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative > mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical > universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to > precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that > universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of > time, I cannot have any idea of where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't > make any difference at all if you say, \\"All right, you don't know where it's > going, but where is it really going?\\" That is precisely the kind of question > that is scientifically meaningless. That is the nature of the world we live > in. That is the quantum mechanical universe.\\"The Quantum Mechanical > Universe\\" (episode 52), 25:37 and following. The series can be purchased from Caltech or streamed from online video sources, including Caltech's official YouTube channel.

Plot Yawara Inokuma is a young girl who aspires to an ordinary life but due to her innate talent is forced to practice judo by her authoritarian grandfather, Jigorou Inokuma, with the aim of achieving the championship in Japan and the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Because of the pressure from her grandfather she generally has a bad attitude about judo, avoiding it as much as she can. However, over time she comes to understand why her grandfather loves judo and appreciates it more. Characters ; : :Played by: Yui Asaka :Yawara is a girl who aspires to an ordinary life but who is forced to practice judo by her grandfather. She is always having romantic daydreams; her biggest dream being to find a boyfriend. (Inokuma means \\"Pig Bear\\"; Yawara is the same Chinese character as \\"ju\\" in \\"judo\\".) Although she has a lot supporters and very close friends such as Fujiko, sometimes she acts selfishly and does not appreciate their commitment toward her (e.g., almost failing to help Fujiko in her All-Japan Selection match). ; : :Played by: Keiju Kobayashi :Jigoro is a seventh-dan Judo Master (though he often inflates this to eighth- or even ninth-dan) and five-time national champion. His passion for judo is rivaled only by his love for Yawara and food (particularly sweets). He has great expectations for Yawara's judo career and is constantly pushing her to do her best and focus primarily on judo. His motto is \\"Judo was not built in a day.\\" He does work on the side as a bone-setting doctor. He is a bit of a media hound as he often tries to hijack publicity events for Yawara to highlight his own life and achievements. He is often overbearing toward Yawara and is not above using mean tricks to get his way, either to thwart her goals and desires or to force her to do what he wants. ; :Tamao is Yawara's mother. She is rarely home as she searches all over Japan for her husband Kojiro. Unlike Jigoro, she does not pressure Yawara to do judo, but she does not detest judo either because it was through judo that she met Kojiro. She tells Yawara that there are other ways to be strong other than judo and that it is possible to be a judoka and be feminine as well. ; :Played by: Bunta Sugawara :Kojiro is Yawara's father. He disappeared soon after winning the 1974 Japan Judo Championship in his debut as an unknown judoka, supposedly training in secrecy in extreme environments (for 20 years?) without letting his family know his whereabouts. ; : :Played by: Yorie Yamashita :Sayaka is an extremely spoiled daughter of one of Japan's richest families. She has never failed to dominate any sport she has cared to try. When Yawara shows her up, she decides to stop at nothing to defeat her and becomes her rival. She has a false tooth, which is a sore point for her, and one that Yawara keeps accidentally bringing up. She becomes Yawara's rival not only in judo but also for Shinnosuke's affection. ; : :Played by: Riki Takeuchi :Shinnosuke is one of the finest judo coaches in all of Japan; he idolizes Jigorou and has been hired by Honami. Despite suffering from stage fright, he is an unbelievable babe-magnet and incorrigible womanizer thanks to his good looks and ability to flatter women with ease and superficial caring. ; : :Played by: Hiroshi Abe :A reporter working for a sports paper (Daily Every Sport), Matsuda becomes convinced Yawara is going to be the next great sports superstar in Japan. He is conflicted by his feelings for Yawara and his goal of making her into a judo superstar. ; : :Played by: Koji Nakamoto :A cameraman working for a sports paper, Kamoda seems to have a knack for taking \\"the perfect shot\\" for headlines. He never refuses any offer of food. ;Hanazono : :Hanazono, the large, overly emotional captain of the judo club at Yawara's high school, becomes devoted to Yawara when she comes to his attention as a skilled judoka. He has a crush on Yawara and tries to be her chief protector, until he meets Fujiko and the two bond over their mutual enthusiasm for Yawara. He is later trained by Jigoro and becomes his college's strongest judo player. ;Yuki Tohdoh :Yuki is a heavyweight judoka who lost to Yawara in the latter's \\"unofficial\\" debut, though Yawara was trying to lose the match. She outweighs Yawara by 20 kg (44 lbs) and looks, talks, and eats like a sumo wrestler. ; : :Jody is the previous year's heavyweight judo world champion (>72 kg division); she is a Canadian who comes to challenge Yawara to a match part way into the series, becoming a friendly rival and regular character. ;Kim Yonsky :Kim is the South Korean \\"secret weapon\\" whose judo incorporates Korean close-in wrestling. She and Sayaka have a judo match in which they come to an exhausting draw and pronounce mutual hatred. ;Anna Teleshikova :Teleshikova is Soviet/Russian judo star who looks like a platinum robot with a butch haircut. She kicks Jody Rockwell in their first match and severely injures Jody's leg. Her habit is to study tapes intensively to figure out her opponent's weak point, which she attacks relentlessly. ;Belkins :Belkins is the Belgian judo champion who is also a model, known as the Judo Queen. She loses to Yawara in the semifinals match at the Judo World Cup and crowns Yawara the \\"New Queen\\". ;Yuutenji :Yuutenji is the judo coach for Sakai College, reputed to be the best in judo. He has been scheming with Jigoro to recruit Yawara. ;Kaga Kuniko :Kuniko is a new photographer for the Daily Every Sport. She wears glasses, flaunts her big breasts with revealing clothing, and uses her ability to cry hysterically on command to get her way. She develops a crush on Matsuda and falsely pretends to be his \\"girlfriend\\" in front of others, repeatedly plotting to ruin the relationship between Matsuda and Yawara. ;Ito Fujiko :Played by: Reiko Hirayama :Fujiko is a very tall student (180 cm, a little over 5‚Ä≤11‚Ä≥) at Mitsuba Women's College whose goal is to experience a \\"once-in-lifetime youth\\" and meet a wonderful man. She is somewhat gloomy and sensitive about her height, which she inherits from both sides of her family. She is not popular with men (until she meets Hanazono) and often ends up drinking alone at social gatherings. She dedicated her youth to ballet dancing until she grew too tall. She becomes Yawara's best friend at college. She organizes Mitsuba's first judo club to help restore Yawara's passion for judo. Under Jigoro's training, she becomes an excellent judoka herself due to her ballerina training, height, and hard work, but lacks confidence and psychological toughness as a competitor. The latter part of the show features her development as a judoka as much as Yawara. ;Komiya Yukari :Komiya is a short-haired student at Mitsuba Women's College. She is flirtatious and a veteran dater. Her stated goal is hook a rich man for marriage. She is friends with Yawara and Fujiko but never joins the Mitsuba judo team. ;Minamda Yoko :Yoko, aka \\"Paddy-field\\", joins the Mitsuba team out of frustration after being repeatedly dumped by men (13 when she joined; 19 when she graduated). She uses \\"(Man's name) you jerk!\\" as a battle cry when she fights. She becomes a police officer after judo. ;Kikage Kyoto :Nicknamed \\"Kyon-kyon\\" (the shadow), she is a small sickly woman who is usually \\"invisible\\" in gatherings. She weighs only 36 kg (about 79 lb). She joins Mitsuba judo to get stronger in health. Although weak, she is also brave and great with details by keeping notes on opponents and is able to absorb Yawara's instructions even without being taught any real moves by Jigoro. ;Yoshinagawa Sayuri :Sayuri joins Mitsuba judo to lose weight. Although not skilled, she often is able to use her weight to pin down opponents (\\"Thank God I'm fat!\\") and can take great punishment. She believes that each match reduces her weight by a few kg. People often mispronounce her surname. ;Oda Mari :Nicknamed \\"Marilyn\\", she is the least serious of the Mitsuba judo club and is mostly seen preening for the camera. Often attracting men's attentions and sometimes molesters, she joins judo to fend them off. She is buxom and wears makeup and earrings to matches, causing her to be disqualified. She aspires to be an actress. Production While Naoki Urasawa was pitching the idea of writing a manga about the medical field, he could tell his editor was not enjoying it. Knowing that the editor was a big fan of baseball, he joking proposed a story about women's judo, but the editor lit up at the idea. Urasawa said that he then scribbled out the whole of Yawara! during that meeting in about 30 minutes, from the characters to the story. The series started in 1986, women's judo became a demonstration sport just before the 1988 Summer Olympics with it set to be a fully competitive sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics, so it was perfect to include that goal in the manga. But the author never thought the series would last long enough to reach the latter. Urasawa revealed that with Yawara! being so different from his previous works as a comedy about a cute girl, some of his fans and colleagues felt betrayed and that he had sold out. But he does not see it that way as he never had any intentions of making it a love comedy or a \\"fight-to-the-finish, don't-give- up-now! sports\\" story. He said \\"My subjects of my comics might be taken from the popular mainstream, but I believe they are still embued with my own sensitivities and therefore quite distinctive in their own right.\\" The author said that he intended for Yawara! to be a parody of Ikki Kajiwara's works, such as Star of the Giants. But for some reason readers got something out of it other than he intended; \\"Maybe it's because they're used to sports comics, but they seem to like my comics for the scenes of victory and defeat. They find them interesting somehow. Those scenes were really supposed to be funny! But they find them touching, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do. (laughter)\\". Urasawa said that because he is not the heroic type himself, he has difficulty portraying strong-willed leading characters. He said it was even difficult to portray Yawara and Matsuda, whom he described as \\"very good supporting characters\\" as it seems to be much easier for him to develop supporting characters. The author cited American television comedies as his comedic influences. Jigoro's habit of forgetting people's names was taken from Samantha's mother in Bewitched. Media =Manga= Written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa, while he was simultaneously illustrating Pineapple Army, Yawara! was serialized weekly in Big Comic Spirits from the 30th issue of 1986 to the 38th issue of 1993. Publisher Shogakukan collected the chapters into 29 tank≈çbon volumes between April 30, 1987 and October 29, 1993. A 19 volume bunkoban edition was released between July 17, 1998 and March 16, 1999. A twenty-volume kanzenban edition was released between December 27, 2013 and April 30, 2015. Urasawa created a spin-off manga series titled Jigoro! that ran in Z≈çkan Big Comic Spirits from October 20, 1988 to April 11, 1991. He explained that he found Yawara's grandfather so interesting that the character earned his own spin-off, and called it one of his favorite series. It was collected into one volume in October 1994, which was republished on February 15, 2003, and again in a kanzenban edition on April 30, 2015. =Anime= Yawara! was adapted into an anime series by Kitty Films. The series was broadcast on Yomiuri TV between October 16, 1989 and September 21, 1992. A total of 124 episodes were produced. The series was licensed for release in North America by Animeigo. Preorders were opened in early 2008. A box set of the first 40 episodes was released on October 31, 2008 and the boxset went out of print on August 31, 2012. =Live-action film= A live-action film adaptation of Yawara! directed by Kazuo Yoshida for Toho opened in theaters on April 15, 1989. Having Yui Asaka in the title role, the film featured cameos by real life judokas like Kaori Yamaguchi and Yasuhiro Yamashita, as well as shoot wrestlers Akira Maeda and Nobuhiko Takada.Yawara! film Asaka also sings the theme song \\"Neverland\\". Reception Yawara! won the 35th Shogakukan Manga Award for general manga in 1990. The significance of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics in the story is that in the real world, this was the first time that Women's Judo would be a full competition event and would thus see the awarding of the first Olympic gold medal for Women's Judo.Judo at the 1992 Summer Olympics Yawara! was very popular in Japan, so when real life Japanese teenager Ryoko Tamura won a silver medal for judo at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, she was seen as a real-life Yawara (her age, stature, and ability all being strikingly similar to those of the fictional character) and promptly nicknamed \\"Yawara-chan\\".A Decade of Dominance  Sports and Fashion  Trends in Japan  Web Japan She was still known by this name eight years later,Olympic Glory  Sports and Fashion  Trends in Japan  Web Japan indicating perhaps the enduring popular recognition of the series as well as that of Ryoko Tamura. Reviewing Animeigo's release of the first 40 episodes of the anime, Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network wrote that Yawara! seamlessly blends romance, humor, life hurdles and sports intrigue. He strongly praised Yawara Inokuma's character and noted that the series is far more focused on romance and coming of age than it is judo. The reviewer finished by lamenting that they do not make anime like this anymore, as they seem to have forgotten the appeal of a simple story told well; Yawara! \\"is quite simply, the most purely enjoyable series in years.\\" Kimlinger went on to pick Yawara Inokuma as his 2008 Character of the Year and called her \\"possibly the most insanely likeable character ever devised‚Äîall the more so because she is as flawed, selfish and naive as any real adolescent girl.\\" While including the series on a list of the best anime from 1989, his colleague Daryl Surat wrote that she inspired numerous fighting video game characters. Namely in the Street Fighter series where Ibuki has a similar background and temperament, and Karin Kanzuki is very similar to Sayaka Honami.

It was serialized in the Shueisha publication, Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1992 to 1996. Zenki was adapted into a fifty-one episode anime television series in 1995 by Studio Deen and also spawned five video games. Enoki Films handles the English language version of the anime. Synopsis Long long ago, the great Bodhisattva of Japan, , controlled the Demon Gods to defeat the Demon Goddess Karuma. After Karuma's defeat, he sealed away one of his Demon Gods, , in a pillar until needed again. Centuries later, his direct descendant, a school girl named (or Cherry Night in some dubs) is able to free Zenki, although the fierce demon lord currently has the form of a bratty demon child. To transform this extremely defiant demon into the form that made him useful by her ancestor, she uses a bracelet that appeared on her wrist when servants of Karuma broke the seal that imprisoned a seed of Karuma. Zenki reawakens because the seeds of Karuma (which look like eyeballs) start appearing and turn people into monsters and Zenki is needed again to eradicate this menace.  Characters  =Main characters= *Zenki Voiced by: Jurota Kosugi (big), Kappei Yamaguchi (little) (Japanese); Robert Buchholz (big), Peter Doyle (little) (English) Zenki is among Enno Ozunu's most powerful warriors: the Demon God of Crimson Thunder Light in the Dark whose power is mainly sources from Thunder and Fire. In the early episodes, Chiaki needed to use the bracelet to transform Zenki into his true form - a giant defiant Demon Lord and a force to be reckoned with in battles. Zenki is undoubtedly powerful, yet rebellious. He can be quite reckless and naive, takes no one's order, and often prefers brawn over brains. In some cases, however, Zenki's anger allows him to transform into his true self. With the help of the bracelet and , Zenki's most faithful comrade, Chiaki is able to transform him into the Ultimate Demon Warrior. The bracelet is no longer necessary when Chiaki attains higher power in the final episode of the anime, after the bracelet is severely damaged, though this does not happen in the manga. Zenki loves eating the Karuma Seeds and switches to bananas when there's no seed. * Chiaki Enno Voiced by: Chisa Yokoyama (Japanese); Michelle Ruff (English) Chiaki Enno is a normal highschool girl, living in a shrine with her grandmother Saki (or lives alone as in the manga). Chiaki takes care of the shrine, and often wears a priestess outfit. She is the direct descendant of Ozunu Enno, the great Bodhisattva who had the power to harness the Demon Gods and fought against evil. Chiaki is also able to turn Zenki into his true Demon God form, casting powerful spells and increase the strength of Zenki. She also managed to summon a small fluffy lovely Guardian Spirit, Lulupapa, who is the mascot of the team. Her parents are working abroad and hence do not appear in the anime. Chiaki is kind, honest and has a good heart. She believes in people and wants to protect them. Chiaki has three dear friends at school (Sayaka, Ako, and Ayame). She gets along very well with Akira/Goki (from season 2 onwards) but often quarrels with Zenki as though he were her little brother, mostly because he is disobedient and shows no respect to other people. The bond between the trio becomes powerful and indestructible in later chapters when they face the evil together. * Goki/Akira Gotou Voiced by: Megumi Ogata (Japanese); Joshua Seth (English) Goki is among Enno Ozunu's most powerful warriors: the Demon God of Azure Light, of Protection and Revival. He was Zenki's most faithful comrade in the past, and has now reincarnated in the form of a human boy named Akira Gotou (or Gokimaru as in the manga), though without most of his elemental powers [Aether-Earth-Water- Fire-Wind]. Goki's deep love for humanity has resulted in his union with a mortal and got several half-demon kids together with her, which marked the beginning of his bloodline on Earth more than a thousand years ago. Goki is wise, kind, well-mannered and fiercely loyal to the Enno lineage. Despite his limited power in present days, he acts as Chiaki's mentor/best friend and is greatly supportive of his new master, always there to protect her, Zenki and their friends at the expense of his life. He is a martial artist, loves making sculptures and drawing, and is known as the Peace-loving Demon Guardian Warrior God. =Supporting characters = *Karuma Voiced by: Yuri Amano (Japanese); Jessica Gee (English) The Queen of Darkness. She wanted to dominate earth with the Seeds of Darkness. The great Ozunu and his demon gods defeated her once, but she returned in a monstrous form. Zenki was able to kill her with the Diamond Dragon Axe at first and finally his Rudora. *Anju Voiced by: Megumi Ogata (Japanese); Dorothy Elias-Fahn (English) One of the minions of Karuma. She was originally human but Karuma brainwashed her. Karuma put the Seed of Darkness in Anju's forehead to make her a monster. When the monster Anju became stronger, Zenki had no choice but to kill her with his Rudra. *Guren / Gulen / Glenn Voiced by: Keiichi Nanba (Japanese); Peter Doyle (English) One of the minions of Karuma. Just as Zenki used the Diamond Axe to kill him, Goura used his magic at the same time. Guren was resurrected by Karuma so he could reveal Goura's betrayal. In the final battle between him and Zenki, Zenki finally killed Guren. *Goura / Goula Voiced by: Shigezou Sasaoka (Japanese); Richard Epcar (English) One of the minions of Karuma. He had planned to betray Karuma, and when Guren revealed this, Karuma killed Goura for being a traitor. *Hirumaki Voiced by: Keiichi Nanba (Japanese); Dan Lorge (English) A henchman of Inugami. Hirumaki is actually a minion of Kagetora sent to spy on Inugami. When the other half of Hirumaki's body was destroyed by Inugami, Kagetora gave him a Seed of Karuma to turn him into a monster, but Zenki killed him afterwards. *Kabura Voiced by: Masashi Sugawara (Japanese); Richard Epcar (English) One of the minions of Kagetora. He almost defeated Zenki in their battle, but Inugami arrived and killed him instead. *Nagi Voiced by: Kotono Mitsuishi (Japanese); Cindy Robinson (English) One of the minions of Kagetora. She used the Karuma Seed to turn herself into a monster. She was defeated by Zenki. Kagetora became angry at her for her loss and killed her despite her deep affection for him. *Kagetora Voiced by: Kouji Tsujitani (Japanese); Richard Cansino (English) The general of the World of Death. He revived the Grand Lord of the World of Death, only for the Grand Lord to turn on him and kill him. *Inugami Voiced by: Kazuya Ichijo (Japanese, anime), Takehito Koyasu (Japanese, PC-FX game); Steve Staley (English) Also known as the Dog Deity - the prince of the World of the Dead and son of En- gai. As such he never knew he had a human mother. When his mother was pulled back into the Realm of the Dead, Inugami used 3 Karuma Seeds to turn himself into a monster in order to kill his enemies. When he was defeated and nearly dead, Inugami went to the Realm of the Dead to ask his mother for help, and he came back to help Zenki defeat the Grand Lord. *Kokutei Inugami's pet wolf. He became a Grand Lord in the final episodes. He was defeated by Zenki, Goki, Chiaki and Inugami. He turned back into a wolf at the end of the series. Media =Manga= 12 vols. Monthly sh≈çnen jump 1778 Re-edition: 7 vols =Anime= 51 episodes were produced and broadcast on TV Tokyo in 1995. An OVA was developed and released in 1997, with a runtime of 30 minutes.

Formed in 1975, it acts as a watchdog group and environmental advocate for the Chicago area. Specifically, it monitors the condition and safety of the Chicago Park District and the forest preserves of Cook County. FOTP's office is in downtown Chicago. Its staff of approximately eight people relies on volunteer efforts for many of its activities. Annual events organized by FOTP include the Earth Day Parks and Preserves Clean-up, mobilizing several thousand volunteers on a single day in April to beautify and clean over 100 Chicago area locations; and a black tie ball which features a charity auction. FOTP assists in educating the public regarding environmental matters. It provides environmental education programs for Chicago students through two programs: Nature Along the Lake (NAL) for elementary students, and the Earth Team, an after-school apprenticeship program for high school students. FOTP encourages grassroots efforts to organize local park organizations and acts as a liaison for organizing volunteer events to maintain and improve Chicago area parks, forest preserves, and other greenspace. On May 3, 2016, a statement released by Melody Hobson stated that the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art would seek a location outside Chicago after a protracted confrontation with FOTP.

If C is the poset of open sets in a topological space, interpreted as a category, then one recovers the usual notion of presheaf on a topological space. A morphism of presheaves is defined to be a natural transformation of functors. This makes the collection of all presheaves on C into a category, and is an example of a functor category. It is often written as \\\\widehat{C} = \\\\mathbf{Set}^{C^\\\\mathrm{op}}. A functor into \\\\widehat{C} is sometimes called a profunctor. A presheaf that is naturally isomorphic to the contravariant hom-functor Hom(‚Äì,A) for some object A of C is called a representable presheaf. Some authors refer to a functor F\\\\colon C^\\\\mathrm{op}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{V} as a \\\\mathbf{V}-valued presheaf.  Examples  * A simplicial set is a Set-valued presheaf on the simplex category C=\\\\Delta.  Properties  * When C is a small category, the functor category \\\\widehat{C}=\\\\mathbf{Set}^{C^\\\\mathrm{op}} is cartesian closed. * The partially ordered set of subobjects of P form a Heyting algebra, whenever P is an object of \\\\widehat{C}=\\\\mathbf{Set}^{C^\\\\mathrm{op}} for small C. * For any morphism f:X\\\\to Y of \\\\widehat{C}, the pullback functor of subobjects f^*:\\\\mathrm{Sub}_{\\\\widehat{C}}(Y)\\\\to\\\\mathrm{Sub}_{\\\\widehat{C}}(X) has a right adjoint, denoted \\\\forall_f, and a left adjoint, \\\\exists_f. These are the universal and existential quantifiers. * A locally small category C embeds fully and faithfully into the category \\\\widehat{C} of set-valued presheaves via the Yoneda embedding which to every object A of C associates the hom functor C(-,A). *The category \\\\widehat{C} admits small limits and small colimits.. See limit and colimit of presheaves for further discussion. * The density theorem states that every presheaf is a colimit of representable presheaves; in fact, \\\\widehat{C} is the colimit completion of C (see #Universal property below.)  Universal property  The construction C \\\\mapsto \\\\widehat{C} = \\\\mathbf{Fct}(C^{\\\\text{op}}, \\\\mathbf{Set}) is called the colimit completion of C because of the following universal property: \\\\longrightarrow D where y is the Yoneda embedding and \\\\widetilde{\\\\eta}: \\\\widehat{C} \\\\to D is a colimit-preserving functor called the Yoneda extension of \\\\eta.}} Proof: Given a presheaf F, by the density theorem, we can write F =\\\\varinjlim y U_i where U_i are objects in C. Then let \\\\widetilde{\\\\eta} F = \\\\varinjlim \\\\eta U_i, which exists by assumption. Since \\\\varinjlim - is functorial, this determines the functor \\\\widetilde{\\\\eta}: \\\\widehat{C} \\\\to D. Succinctly, \\\\widetilde{\\\\eta} is the left Kan extension of \\\\eta along y; hence, the name \\"Yoneda extension\\". To see \\\\widetilde{\\\\eta} commutes with small colimits, we show \\\\widetilde{\\\\eta} is a left-adjoint (to some functor). Define \\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\eta, -): D \\\\to \\\\widehat{C} to be the functor given by: for each object M in D and each object U in C, :\\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\eta, M)(U) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}_D(\\\\eta U, M). Then, for each object M in D, since \\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\eta, M)(U_i) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}(y U_i, \\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\eta, M)) by the Yoneda lemma, we have: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Hom}_D(\\\\widetilde{\\\\eta} F, M) &= \\\\operatorname{Hom}_D(\\\\varinjlim \\\\eta U_i, M) = \\\\varprojlim \\\\operatorname{Hom}_D(\\\\eta U_i, M) = \\\\varprojlim \\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\eta, M)(U_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\widehat{C}}(F, \\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\eta, M)), \\\\end{align} which is to say \\\\widetilde{\\\\eta} is a left-adjoint to \\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\eta, -). \\\\square The proposition yields several corollaries. For example, the proposition implies that the construction C \\\\mapsto \\\\widehat{C} is functorial: i.e., each functor C \\\\to D determines the functor \\\\widehat{C} \\\\to \\\\widehat{D}.  Variants  A presheaf of spaces on an ‚àû-category C is a contravariant functor from C to the ‚àû-category of spaces (for example, the nerve of the category of CW-complexes.) It is an ‚àû-category version of a presheaf of sets, as a \\"set\\" is replaced by a \\"space\\". The notion is used, among other things, in the ‚àû-category formulation of Yoneda's lemma that says: C \\\\to PShv(C) is fully faithful (here C can be just a simplicial set.)

History  This binding was invented in the mid-1980s by Anne Goy, a Belgian bookbinder. She was looking for a Western version of the traditional Japanese stab binding techniques. She wanted a book that would open flat but with the appearance of the stab sewing. Anne Goy calls this binding the \\"crisscross binding\\".

The covers are attached by sewing through holes on the cover boards and passing over and under the spine piece. The previously sewn textblock is attached when the threads that pass under the spine piece also pass through the stitches on the spine of the textblock. The spine piece is held in place only by these threads passing over and under it. It creates a distinct thread pattern on the cover and it is a very sturdy binding that allows the book to open completely flat.

Established as Camp Chaffee in 1941, renamed to Fort Chaffee in 1956, Fort Chaffee has served as a United States Army base, training camp, prisoner-of-war camp, and refugee camp. The base was closed following the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission round. Since that time, the Arkansas National Guard has been using as a training facility. The State of Arkansas received , about half of which have been redeveloped as of 2014. The main environmental concern has been asbestos, released during various fires. Location Fort Chaffee is just outside Fort Smith (Sebastian County) and Barling (Sebastian County) on Arkansas Highway 22, southeast of Fort Smith Regional Airport. The Arkansas River flows eastward along its northern border and Interstate 40 is to the north on the opposite side of the river. History =Foundation= Fort Chaffee was originally named Camp Chaffee. The camp was named after Major General Adna R. Chaffee Jr., an artillery officer who, in Europe during World War I, determined that the cavalry was outmoded and, unlike other cavalry officers, advocated for the use of tanks. The groundbreaking of Camp Chaffee was held on , as part of the Department of War's preparations to double the size of the U.S. Army in the face of World War II. That month, the U.S. government paid to acquire from 712 property owners, including families, farms, businesses, churches, schools, and other government agencies. It took only sixteen months to build the entire base. The first soldiers arrived on , the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The installation was activated on March 27, 1942 and from 1942 to 1946, the 6th, 14th and 16th Armored Divisions trained there. The creation of the camp caused the nearby town of Barling to experience a tremendous boom in housing and businesses. Fort Chaffee also served as a prisoner-of-war-camp during World War II, housing 3,000 German prisoners of war. =Elvis Presley= From 1948 to 1957, Chaffee was the home of the 5th Armored Division. On March 21, 1956, the name of Camp Chaffee was officially changed to Fort Chaffee in recognition of the permanent nature of the base. For four days in 1958, Chaffee was home to Elvis Presley, who as part of his induction into the Army received his first military haircut in Building 803. In 1959, the \\"Home of the U.S. Army Training Center, Field Artillery\\" moved from Fort Chaffee to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where it remains to this day. =Vietnam War refugees= Cambodian refugees who had lived at the camp and had been subsequently resettled, as well as the number still living there. Fort Chaffee served as a primary center for housing refugees three times; from 1975 to 1976 it was a processing center for refugees from Southeast Asia and held Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees after the Vietnam and Cambodia wars. The facility processed 50,809 refugees of the Vietnam War, giving them medical screenings, matching them with sponsors, and arranging for their resettlement in the United States. Among notable children of refugees born at Fort Chaffee was Dat Nguyen, who would later become an All-American linebacker at Texas A&M; University and play professionally for the Dallas Cowboys. =Cuban refugees= In 1980, Fort Chaffee became a Cuban refugee resettlement center, holding 19,000 Cubans after the Mariel boatlift and briefly making the camp the 11th largest city in Arkansas. The Cubans were brought to the fort in early May, and there were delays in processing and resettlement caused by \\"bureaucratic setbacks and rumors (later prove true by refugee actions described herewith) that Chaffee was full of Cuban criminals released from prison by Fidel Castro.\\"1980 - Crisis at Ft. Chaffee, September 23, 2004, Arkansas Times. On Sunday, June 1, the detainees rioted, destroying four barracks and fighting with State Police officers and National Guardsmen. Sixty-two refugees were injured and 46 others were arrested. After the riots, the previously unsecured facility was \\"turned into a prison, encircled with miles of concertina wire and 2,000 heavily-armed federal troops.\\" The riot was a major issue in Frank D. White's victory over Governor Bill Clinton in the November 1980 gubernatorial election. Over two years, Fort Chaffee processed 25,390 Cuban refugees.Fort Chaffee, Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture. =Developments= In 1987, the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) began training soldiers at Chaffee. In 1993 the JRTC was transferred to Fort Polk, Louisiana and in 1995, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closure of Fort Chaffee. The recommendation was approved with the condition that minimum essential ranges, facilities, and training areas were maintained as a Reserve component training enclave. On September 28, 1995, Fort Chaffee became a subinstallation of Fort Sill. In late 1995, the federal government declared of Fort Chaffee's to be surplus and turned the land over to the state, while the remaining were turned over to the Arkansas National Guard for use as a training facility. On September 27, 1997 command of Fort Chaffee was transferred from the U.S. Army to the Arkansas Army National Guard when the U.S. Army garrison was deactivated, with Fort Chaffee subsequently becoming the Chaffee Maneuver Training Center for Light Combat Forces, and later simply Chaffee Joint Maneuver Training Center. The Arkansas Air National Guard stationed at Ebbing Air National Guard Base, Fort Smith has used the fort's Razorback Range for target practice with their A-10s until January 2014 when their mission changed, but Razorback Range remained under the control of the 188th Wing. On April 15, 2014 the Arkansas National Guard's new Fort Chaffee Combined Arms Collective Training Facility opened; the $26 million training center consisting of 18 buildings is meant to recreate a small city and includes 189 cameras. In September 2017, the Arkansas Air National Guard at Ebbing Air National Guard Base transferred Razorback Range back to the control of Chaffee Joint Maneuver Training Center. Redevelopment In 1997 the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority was established to redevelop the acres that were turned over to the state. This included demolishing more than 700 buildings and rezoning land. Redevelopment of the base began shortly after land was turned over, and the redevelopment authority is overseeing a number of residential, commercial, and industrial projects in what is known as 'Chaffee Crossing'. After property transfers were complete and with minimal military staff permanently stationed, the Chaffee Maneuver Training Center was declared an open post. The gatehouses were abandoned, and most of the fencing was removed. Military police patrols were discontinued, and emergency services turned over to the city of Barling, the Arkansas State Police, and Arkansas Highway Patrol Troop H. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks all Army installations in the U.S. were declared closed posts, and the center again took over emergency services. Busses loaded with Hurricane Katrina refugees arrive at Fort Chaffee On January 6, 2005, ground was broken for the Janet Huckabee Arkansas River Valley Nature Center. In September 2005 Fort Chaffee housed evacuees after Hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana. The empty barracks were converted into temporary housing for more than 10,000 refugees from Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and other areas affected by the hurricane. Many of the evacuees that were sponsored or temporarily housed at Fort Chaffee have since decided to make Fort Smith their new home, which has brought a slight increase to the city's economy. In September 2011, a rectangular block of the base, containing 44 World War II-era barracks buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Bounded by Terry and Ellis Streets and Darby and Ward Avenues, these barracks were built 1941-42 to house two tank destroyer battalions. The district was slightly enlarged in 2015. During 2013, Chaffee has seen a mix of developments, with the announcement of a new 70 store shopping center along Arkansas Highways 22 and 59, the creation of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine, an expansion of Umarex and the construction of several large housing developments. The area is also home to manufacturing facilities operated by Graphic Packaging and Mars Petcare. A wind turbine manufacturing building owned by Mitsubishi was never utilized and the more than 400 jobs planned faded when economics changed within the wind energy industry. In May 2014 ArcBest Corp announced construction of an office building and data center to add an estimated 975 corporate jobs by 2021. FCRA is down to about remaining for development, of which about 25% is intended for residential development, roughly 40% to 50% is targeted for commercial and retail development, while the remaining land is intended for industrial development. In September 2017, the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority bought back the land for the shopping center at Hwy 59 and Hwy 22 as the developer had already received 5 time extensions, and no construction had yet started. Environmental contamination The 2008 fire uncovered the only environmental contamination to date: asbestos. Fires During the morning hours of January 29, 2008, a mixture of high winds and fire, which local authorities determined later an electrical brush fire, burned approximately and damaged or destroyed 150 abandoned buildings at Fort Chaffee. On the night of August 3, 2011, a fire broke out on the 90 acre former medical complex, destroying the hospital and nearly 120 buildings in the area. This was, according to the National Weather Service, the hottest day in Fort Chaffee history at 115 degrees Fahrenheit. The fire's cause was ruled accidentalhttp://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/aug/11/fort-chaffee- hospital-fire-ruled-accidental/?latest before it became known that a cigarette dropped by a Kentucky National Guardsman of the 138th Fires Brigade was the culprit. A fire destroyed an office building on June 20, 2014. Other uses of Fort Chaffee Fort Chaffee has been used as a set for various movies, including A Soldier's Story in 1984, Biloxi Blues in 1988, The Tuskegee Airmen in 1995 and it was featured in episode 10 of the 4th season of Ghost Adventures on November 19, 2010.

The fire as seen from the Thermaic Gulf. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 () destroyed two thirds of the city of Thessaloniki, the second-largest city in Greece, leaving more than 70,000 homeless.Gerolympos, Alexandra Karadimou. The Redesign of Thessaloniki after the Fire of 1917. University Studio Press, Thessaloniki, 1995 The fire burned for 32 hours and destroyed 9,500 houses within an extent of 1 square kilometer. Half the Jewish population emigrated from the city as their livelihoods were gone. Rather than quickly rebuilding, the government commissioned the French architect Ernest H√©brard to design a new urban plan for the burned areas Thessaloniki and for the future expansion of the city. His designs are still evident in the city, most notably Aristotelous Square, although some of his most grandiose plans were never completed due to a lack of funds.  The city before the fire  Thessaloniki in the late 1800s. Thessaloniki was one of the largest and most modern cities in Europe by Balkan standards at the time of the fire. By European standards, the city's planning was chaotic and the unhygienic conditions that prevailed in the poorer areas were described as \\"unacceptable\\" by the government in Athens. The city's harbour was one of the most important centres of trade in the region. In 1912 the city, along with the biggest part of Macedonia and Epirus, was incorporated in Greece after almost 500 years of Ottoman rule. The population of the city was essentially maintained: the larger part of the population were Sephardi Jews, followed by Greeks, Turks, Bulgarians, Roma and others. As soon as World War I began in 1914, Greece officially maintained neutrality. With authorization by the Venizelos' government, Entente Forces had landed troops in Thessaloniki in 1915, in order to support their Serb allies in the Macedonian Front. In August 1916, Venizelist officers launched an uprising that resulted in the establishment of the Provisional Government of National Defence in the city, essentially dividing Greece into two sovereign states, one represented by Eleftherios Venizelos, and the other by King Constantine. After King Constantine abdicated in June 1917, Greece was reunified again and entered officially the war with the Allies side. Thessaloniki soon became a transit center for Allied troops and supplies, and the city filled with thousands of French and British soldiers, numbering up to 100,000. The population of the city at the time is dubious, with some sources claiming around 150,000 and others 278,000. French navy official Dufour de la Thuillerie writes in his report that \\"I saw Thessaloniki, a city of more than 150,000 people, burn\\".  The fire  = Start of the fire = Aerial picture of the fire. According to the findings of the investigation by the Court of Thessaloniki, the fire began on Saturday 5 (OS, Julian Calendar) /18 (NS) August 1917 at roughly 15:00, by accident at a small house of refugees at Olympiados 3, in the Mevlane district between the center and the Upper City when a spark from the kitchen fire fell in a pile of straw and ignited it. Due to lack of water and indifference, the initial fire was not put out. Eventually, an intense wind carried the fire to the neighboring houses, and it continued throughout central Thessaloniki.Prof. Dr. Ch. K. Papastathis & Dr. E. A. Hekimoglou. The Great Fire of Thessaloniki (1917), Thessaloniki, 2010 Initially the fire followed two directions, to the Residency via the road of Agiou Dimitriou, and to the market via the Leontos Sofou road. The Residency was saved by its employees, who hurried to help. The wind strengthened and continued to spread the fire towards the center of the city. In the early morning of the next day (6/19 August), the wind changed direction and the two fronts of the fire destroyed all the commercial center. At 12:00, the fire passed around the grounds of the church of Haghia Sophia without burning it, and continued eastward up to the road of Ethnikis Amynis (former name: Hamidie), where it stopped. On the evening of that day the fire completely died out. = Efforts at firefighting = Destruction caused by the fire, with the Ministry for Macedonia and Thrace in the background. There was not enough water for firefighting because (to serve their camps and hospitals in the suburbs of the city) the Allied forces controlled water reserves, which were reduced due to the drought of that summer and the high water consumption of the growing population. More significantly, the city government did not have an organized fire brigade; a few firefighting teams were privately owned by insurance companies that protected only their subscribers. The private firefighters were found to be untrained and equipped with old or no equipment. In the afternoon of the first day of the fire, a French detachment exploded three houses next to the Diikitirio to create a buffer zone or area of safety. However, the French detachment did not continue and ended up withdrawing, leaving the fire to continue on its destructive course. The next morning, two British fire engines and teams stopped the fire near the White Tower. French soldiers saved the customs building. The Allied forces rejected the idea of interrupting the water supply of their camps and hospitals to use for firefighting. General Maurice Sarrail visited the region of Diikitiriou for a few hours during the afternoon of the first day but he did not return. Several reports noted that French soldiers looted stores and businesses and prevented householders from rescuing their goods. The next day, General Sarrail ordered the execution of two French soldiers who were arrested for selling stolen jewels. The British soldiers assisted in the firefight as long as they could, using military lorries to transport fire victims and their goods to refugee settlements. (Drivers of French cars reportedly asked for pourboire - tips, for the same service.)  Destruction  A map showing the huge area destroyed by the fire. The fire destroyed 32% of Thessaloniki, about 1 square kilometer. The burned region was between the roads of Aghiou Dimitriou, Leontos Sofou, Nikis, Ethnikis Amynis, Alexandrou Svolou, and Egnatia (from Aghia Sofia). This region is reported in official documents as \\"burned zone\\" (, pirikafstos zoni) and in the popular narrations simply as \\"the burned\\" (, ta kammena). The extent of material damage within Thessaloniki was calculated to be worth 8,000,000 golden pounds. Included among buildings that were burned were the Post Office, the telegraph office, the town hall, the water supply, and gas company headquarters, the Ottoman Bank, the National Bank of Greece, the deposits of the Bank of Athens, parts of the Saint Demetrius church, two other Orthodox churches, the Saatli Mosque, 11 other mosques, the seat of the chief rabbi with all its archive, 16 of the 33 synagogues, and the printing-houses of most newspapers. Thessaloniki had the highest number of published newspapers in Greece, but after the fire most did not manage to rebuild their businesses and publish again. Approximately 4,096 of the 7,695 shops within the city were destroyed, many of which were Jewish, and 70% of the workforce was unemployed. = Care of fire victims = The people affected by the fire totaled approximately 73,447. The Pallis Report identified the homeless by the three religious communities of Thessaloniki: 52,000 Jews, 10,000 Orthodox and 11,000 Muslims. Refugees after the fire. The care for the fire victims started immediately: Greek authorities constructed 100 houses to shelter 800 families. The British authorities established three settlements with 1,300 tents, where they accommodated 7,000 homeless. The French authorities set up a settlement for 300 families, and built the Union of French Ladies, a smaller camp for 100 families. Together they transported 5,000 people by train for free and relocated the refugees to Athens, Volos and Larissa. The Greek authorities set up distribution points providing free bread to 30,000 individuals. The American, French, and British Red Cross distributed food among the homeless. Nearly half the city's Jews, having lost both homes and shops, soon emigrated to western countries, mainly France and the United States, while some emigrated to Palestine. Pericles A. Argyropoulos, the major government representative, founded the Administration for Victims of Fire for the care of thousands of fire victims; and the government approved credit of 1,500,000 drachmas for the first needs. Simultaneously, the Central Committee for Donations was organized, with a line of sub-committees for the collection of donations and the distribution of money and goods. = Compensation = After the destruction of the city, insurance companies sent their agents to survey the damage. There were rumours that Germans or French had caused the fire by arson, but these were disproved. The total amount of insurance contracts was about 3,000,000 golden pounds. The majority of insurance companies within the region were British. The insurance company, North British and Mercantile Insurance, had to compensate 3,000 insurance contracts. The Court deemed the fire was caused by accidental reasons. Under the pressure of Greek and foreign authorities along with the Court, all of the insurance policies were completely paid.  Reconstruction  Hebrard's proposal for a Place Civique, 1918 Only a few days after the fire, the Venizelos government announced that it would not allow reconstruction of the city as it was. They intended to create a new city instead, according to an urban plan. The Minister of Transports Alexandros Papanastasiou was given the lead and founded the \\"International Committee for the New Plan of Thessaloniki\\". He appointed as chairman the French architect and archeologist Ernest H√©brard, who supervised development of the plan. Delivered to the General Administration of Macedonia on 29 June 1918, the plan was to redevelop the city along European lines. It went through many changes, but established improved transportation routes, squares and other amenities to support a large population.

The M4 motorway passes some 250 metres to the south, and the motorway's Leigh Delamere services lie to the east of the village. The civil parish of Leigh Delamere (which included the hamlet of Sevington, about one mile southwest of the village) was absorbed by Grittleton parish in 1934.  Buildings  The village comprises a church, a former farm, eight almshouses and eight houses. The rebuilding of the church (1846) and the construction of the Tudor-style row of almshouses (1848) were at the expense of Joseph Neeld, who bought the Grittleton estate in 1828 after inheriting a large sum. In both cases the architect was James Thomson, who also worked on the rectory (1846, also in Tudor style) and Grittleton House (from 1832). Manor Farmhouse is from the 17th century, with alterations for Neeld in 1842. A separate large barn is from the 18th or early 19th century. St Margaret's Church St Margaret of Antioch Church St Margaret's Church was built on the site of a previous 12th-century church in 1846 and dedicated to Margaret the Virgin.

In somewhat higher society, the stand-in swear word Au Banan! (old banana) is particularly used. (A huur in Aachen dialect historically denoted a menial worker, cognate with English \\"hireling\\", from Dutch huren \\"to hire/to rent\\".) *The interjection Aah suae? is also prevalent instead of the standard German versions Ach so? (So?) and Tats√§chlich? (Really?). *The waa (originally \\"is it true?\\") somehow resembles the English \\"isn't it?\\", or \\"is it?\\" that some speakers customarily append to their sentences.

It originally appeared as a short story called \\"Mr. Blandings Builds His Castle\\" in the April 1946 issue of Fortune magazine. Within two years the novel had sold 540,000 copies. The screen rights were sold for $200,000. It was adapted as a film of the same name, released in 1948, which starred Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas. Later three radio adaptations were also performed, with Grant in the leading role, followed by a weekly radio series, also starring Grant. Plot summary The book begins in fictional Landsdale County, Connecticut, where Jim and Muriel Blandings are being shown an old farmhouse by a real estate agent. Blandings, a successful New York advertising executive, and his wife want to leave their tiny Midtown apartment, where they live with their two daughters. They fantasize that the farmhouse will meet their needs. After some negotiation, they buy the house. They soon learn that the house is structurally unsound and must be torn down. They design the perfect home in the country, imagining an idyll, but they are quickly beset by construction troubles, temperamental workmen, skyrocketing bills, threatening lawyers, and difficult neighbors. The Blandings' dream house soon threatens to be the nightmare that undoes them. Hodgins wrote a sequel, Blandings Way, published in 1950. The real house The short story and novel were based on the author Eric Hodgins's experience with buying property and building a house in the Merryall area of the town of New Milford, Connecticut. The real house was completed in 1939, but was so expensive ‚Äî his original budget was $11,000 but the final cost was about $56,000 ‚Äî that Hodgins was forced to sell it. It was sold in 1945 for $38,000 to John Allard, a retired Air Force general. Hodgins unsuccessfully tried to buy the house back after receiving $200,000 in movie rights to the book. In 1953, the house was sold to Ralph Gulliver, a fuel oil dealer in New Milford, who gave it to his son, Jack, in 1972. In 1980, the house was sold to the author and composer Stephen Citron and his wife, the biographer and novelist Anne Edwards. In 2004, the house was sold for $1.2 million. Unlike in the book and the movie, Hodgins did not tear down the old farmhouse, but built the new house next to it. The farmhouse remained until at least the 1970s. Characters  *Mr. James Blandings - advertising executive *Mrs. Muriel Blandings - his wife *Mr. William \\"Bill\\" Cole - the Blandings' lawyer and friend Adaptations In addition to the 1948 film, the novel was adapted as three radio plays, all starring Cary Grant. In 1951 Grant starred in a follow- up radio series titled Mr. and Mrs. Blandings on NBC. The novel was also the basis of the 2007 film Are We Done Yet?, starring Ice Cube.
